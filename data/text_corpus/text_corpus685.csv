and improve the multi step ahead flood forecasting accuracy as compared to the lstm red model keywords flood forecasting multi step ahead neural network deep learning encoder decoder exogenous input 1 introduction reliable and accurate flood forecasts are essential for reservoir operations especially for flood control power generation and navigation zhu et al 2020 lin et al 2020 chen et al 2020 gauch et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022a many methods or models have been developed to simulate rainfall runoff processes for flood forecasting which are broadly classified into two categories process based models and data driven models samaniego et al 2010 birkel and soulsby 2015 eslamian et al 2018b seibert et al 2018 chen et al 2020 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 filipova et al 2022 ridolfi et al 2021 li et al 2021a process based models consider the causal mechanisms of rainfall runoff transformation and generalize complex hydrological phenomena to a certain extent and therefore play a dominant role in real time flood forecasting zhao 1992 guo et al 2004 chen et al 2020 eslamian et al 2018a beylich et al 2021 however the rainfall runoff transformation process is accompanied by nonlinear and non stationary characteristics and it is difficult for process based models to simulate the complex hydrologic process comprehensively data driven models the deep learning model based on the long short term memory lstm neural network benefit from their adeptness in extracting intrinsic connections from big data to effectively simulate complex systems with nonlinear and non stationary characteristics shortridge et al 2016 granata et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2017 yan et al 2018 hu et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 artificial neural networks anns one of the representative data driven models have been successfully applied to rainfall runoff simulation for many years young et al 2017 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021a anns are able to extract useful information from observed data and have proved their effectiveness in dealing with nonlinear non smooth series problems ha stenstrom 2003 chang et al 2014 chang et al 2015 chang tsai 2016 wang et al 2021 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021b with the maturity of computer technology and hardware facilities the deep neural network dnn technology based on anns has gained broad attention tennant et al 2020 compared with the simple ann one of dnns obvious advantages is that they can consider the correlation between input variables at adjacent moments in one two or even higher dimensions and capture the dependencies among variables zhou 2020 this characteristic is beneficial for tackling time series prediction with first order or higher order markov property kratzert et al 2018 one of the most representative dnn techniques is the deep learning technique based on lstm neural networks the lstm neural network proposed by hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 is a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns which overcomes the problems such as gradient explosion or disappearance occurring in rnn zhou 2020 it not only effectively memorizes information from previous time steps but also achieves parameter sharing in neural networks of different time steps which enables a reduction in the computational cost and is very advantageous to process time correlated data series thus deep learning models based on lstm neural networks have been applied to hydrologic forecasting kratzert et al 2018 used the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset to validate the effectiveness of lstm in rainfall runoff modeling and found the lstm neural network could obtain better performance when used as the regional hydrological model hu et al 2018 investigated the performance of lstm in rainfall runoff simulation and found that the lstm outperformed the ann with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse exceeding 0 9 gao et al 2020 studied the effect of the time step length on forecast accuracy and found that the lstm neural network could improve forecast accuracy as the time step increases however an lstm model depends on a large amount of data easily leading to overfitting in particular flood forecast accuracy decreases as the forecast horizon increases due to insufficient input variables with long periods although there are some studies that take the output of the previous forecast horizon as the input of the following forecast horizon i e recursive strategy this measure tends to cause the transmission and accumulation of forecast errors young et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 kurian et al 2020 in order to improve the accuracy and applicability of the lstm neural network in multi step ahead flood forecasting some studies fused a process based model with the lstm neural network in an attempt to compensate each other s inherent limitations zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2022b the fusion approach generally takes the output of the process based model as an additional feature input to the lstm neural network some studies have conducted the runoff simulation to explore the effectiveness of this fusion approach for instance yang et al 2019 constructed a hybrid physics machine learning model by taking temperature precipitation wind speed and the simulated flow of the ghms cama flood model chain as inputs to the lstm neural network for simulating global floods they concluded that the hybrid model could significantly improve the accuracy of global flood simulations konapala et al 2020 proposed a hybrid model using the simulated flows from the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac model as inputs of the lstm neural network for simulating runoff of 531 watersheds under different conditions they concluded that the hybrid model could combine the advantages of sac and lstm models and improve the simulation accuracy cui et al 2021 constructed a hybrid xaj lstm model that integrated the xinanjiang xaj model into the lstm neural network for multi step ahead flood forecasting they found that the hybrid model could obtain more accurate long lead time forecasts than the xaj and lstm models which promotes the transformation of this fusion approach from the theoretical simulation to multi step ahead flood forecasting in practice with the development of artificial intelligence technology the encoder decoder ed structure is developed to solve the sequence to sequence problem emerging in the natural language processing the ed structure combined with a deep learning model enables multi step output under the premise of considering the correlation of time series and achieves the best translation results sutskever et al 2014 cho et al 2014 the encoding process extracts critical information from the input features in multiple time steps and information compression kao et al 2020 yin et al 2021 the medium vector connecting the encoder and decoder processes is the hidden layer output of the last time step in the encoding process which contains the critical information extracted from the input features the decoding process is to transform the medium vector into the target output the ed structure is sensitive to the order of the input sequence and can consider the temporal association among sequences therefore the ed structure is suitable for tackling sequence to sequence problems and can directly produce multiple outputs corresponding to multiple time steps ha et al 2021 the streamflow sequences are continuously varying time series with strong autocorrelation and therefore the ed structure is suitable for handling multi step ahead flood forecasting the common ed structures in hydrological forecasting can be roughly divided into two types the first type is the recursive encoder decoder red structure proposed by cho et al 2014 where the input of each time step in the decoding process consists of the medium vector and the output value of the previous time step the second type is the static encoder decoder sed structure where only the medium vector is used as the input to each time step of the decoding process xiang and demir 2020a han et al 2021 xiang et al 2020b applied the sed structure coupled with the lstm neural network lstm sed model to hourly flood forecasting in the clear creek and upper wapsipinicon river watersheds in iowa usa with a comparison of common machine learning models such as linear regression lasso regression and ridge regression the observed and forecasted precipitation previously observed flow monthly evapotranspiration and upstream forecast data were used as inputs to the ed structure they confirmed that the proposed lstm sed model could improve the accuracy of short term flood forecasts kao et al 2020 used the red structure combined with the lstm neural network lstm red model for 1 6 h flood forecasting in the shimen reservoir watershed the inputs to the ed structure included the previously observed flow discharges and precipitation only they demonstrated that the lstm red model could obtain accurate multi step ahead flood forecasts and reduce the root mean square error rmse by 3 38 during the testing period compared with an ed model based on feed forward neural network ffnn red model han et al 2021 constructed an lstm sed model to forecast floods in the russian river basin of northern california usa observed flow data at the outlet point and four upstream stations were used as inputs to the ed structure their results show that the lstm sed model performs well with nse values ranging from 0 97 to 0 99 and correlation coefficient r metrics ranging from 0 98 to 0 99 at 1 6 h forecast horizons ha et al 2021 developed three dnn models i e lstm conv lstm and gate recurrent unit gru neural networks based on the red structure and applied them to the yangtze river basin based on el niño southern oscillation and monthly flood data they found that the conv lstm neural network could improve the stability of the ed structure and produce the best forecasting results with the r index exceeding 0 8 and the rmse index below 8000 m3 s meanwhile the introduction of the oscillation factor could improve the forecast accuracy of flood peaks and flood occurrence times yin et al 2021 improved the sed structure and developed an lstm based multi state vector sequence to sequence rainfall runoff model as well as compared it with the models proposed by xiang et al 2020b and kao et al 2020 the model used multi state vectors for multi step ahead runoff forecasting where observed and forecasted meteorological materials such as daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and vapor pressure and previously observed runoff were employed as inputs to the ed structure their experiments in 673 watersheds showed that the proposed model could improve the forecast accuracy for 7d forecast horizon of the benchmark model and therefore is suitable for multi day ahead runoff forecasting although the above studies demonstrated that neural networks combining ed structures could achieve more accurate multi step ahead flood forecasts the recursive process problems and limitations of the red structure have not been discussed the following research questions need to be answered which motivated the current study and formed the research objectives first what is the difference between the lstm red model and the single output lstm model with a recursive process second what are the advantages and disadvantages of the lstm red model considering recursive processes for multi step ahead flood forecasting finally can the disadvantages of the lstm red model be solved by the above mentioned fusion approach the following research work is carried out to achieve the objectives 1 explore the differences between the lstm red model and the lstm model with a recursive process as well as analyze the impact of the recursive process within the lstm red model on multi step ahead flood forecast accuracy from different perspectives 2 fuse the flow forecasts from the xaj model into the lstm ed model in an attempt to solve the disadvantages of the lstm red model to the best of the authors knowledge this fusion approach focusing on combining process based models with the single output lstm neural network has not been considered so far in the ed structure models therefore the novelty of this study is that an innovative ed structure with an exogenous input ede is proposed for the first time by considering the forecasted flow of the xaj model as the exogenous input variable the lstm neural network is integrated into the ede structure to build the lstm ede model the lushui and jianxi basins in china are selected as the case studies to conduct the multi step ahead flood forecasting and to demonstrate the improvement in the applicability of emerging artificial intelligence techniques the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed methods and approaches section 3 briefly introduces the case study and materials section 4 evaluates and analyzes the results of the models adopted for multi step ahead flood forecasting section 5 provides a discussion based on the forecast results conclusions are then given in section 6 2 methods this study proposes a novel lstm ede model which is compared with the xaj lstm and lstm red models the frameworks of the red and ede structures are presented in fig 1 2 1 recursive encoder decoder red structure the red structure in fig 1 a was proposed by cho et al 2014 where the input of each time step of the decoding process consists of a medium vector and the output value of the previous moment like the strategy of recursive feedback input the highlighted arrow in the fig 1 a indicates the recursive feedback input process through the recursive process the decoding process in the red structure can receive not only the important information extracted from the encoding process but also the changing information from the previous moment during the training period the decoding process of the red structure does not employ a recursive input strategy but employs the target output of the previous moment i e the target output observed flow at t 1 moment is used as the input at t 2 moment also known as the teacher forcing mechanism toomarian barhen 1992 during the validation period also known as the inference process bengio et al 2015 the decoding process of the red structure adopts the recursive input strategy because of the unavailability of the observed flows in the forecast horizon i e the output forecasted flow at t 1 moment is used as the input at t 2 moment this is the reason for the inconsistency between training and validation processes of the red structure the problem is called exposure bias in natural language processing zhang et al 2019 meanwhile it is found from fig 1 a that the recursive input strategy complicates the inference process we will analyze the characteristics of the red structure from different perspectives in the subsequent sections 2 2 encoder decoder with an exogenous input ede structure we propose the encoder decoder with an exogenous input ede structure and specify the exogenous input from the forecasted flow sequence of the process based model the ede structure allows the decoding process to receive information associated with the target output and helps the decoder capture the connection between the input and the target output the length of the exogenous input should be equal to the maximum forecasting period the ede structure takes the medium vector and the exogenous input as the inputs for each time step of the decoding process and the structure is shown in fig 1 b the input of the decoder in the ede structure is always the forecasted flows of the process based model and the medium vector during training and validation processes therefore the training and validation processes remain consistent the ede structure has another advantage of simplifying the recursive process and is beneficial to the computational efficiency of the inference process the most critical difference between red and ede structures is the input factor of the decoding process i e the input in the decoding process of the ede structure is changed to the exogenous input instead of the output value of the previous moment 2 3 long short term memory lstm neural network unit the lstm neural network consists of a forgetting gate an input gate and an output gate each gate of the lstm neural network connects the information of the input layer and the output

2019 xu et al 2021 to calculate the multi step ahead flood forecasts in training and validation periods i e the forecast results of the previous forecast horizon are used as the input to the neural network of the following forecast horizon the lstm model trains the neural network structure by means of multiple inputs and single outputs after acquiring an excellent network structure the recursive input strategy is employed for multi step ahead flood forecasting lstm neural network units are integrated into red and ede structures to construct lstm red and lstm ede models respectively we employ a fault testing method to determine the relevant hyperparameters of the neural network models one layer with 64 hidden units neurons of the lstm neural network is adopted in both the encoder and the decoder the single output lstm model adopts a two layer structure with 64 hidden units in each layer the loss function is the mean square error meanwhile the adam optimization method in tensorflow keras optimizers is applied to training the model and its parameters are set to be default values learning rate 0 001 beta 1 0 9 beta 2 0 999 epsilon 1e 07 li et al 2021b the batch size and epochs are set to be 100 and 500 respectively 2 4 evaluation of model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 the relative error of total streamflow re and the root mean square error

lushui basin the lushui river with a watershed area of about 3950 km2 is a first class tributary of the middle reaches of the yangtze river as shown in fig 2 b the topography of the basin is high in the southeast and low in the northwest this basin belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone with a warm climate and its annual average temperature rainfall and runoff volume are about 15 5 c 1 550 mm and 3 03 billion m3 respectively the rainy season generally concentrates in april september accounting for 70 of the annual rainfall the lushui reservoir is located at the outlet of the valley of the mainstream the effective storage capacity of the lushui reservoir is about 408 million m3 with a flood prevention storage of only about 163 million m3 since the small and medium sized mountainous basins are often characterized by concentrated precipitation and fast runoff production as well as easy to cause flood disasters accurate flood forecasts can provide the reservoir important guidance for controlling river water levels and preventing flood due to the limitation of a small flood prevention storage capacity accurate multi step ahead inflow forecasts are crucial for flood control and water resources management of the lushui reservoir this study collected data series during the wet period spanning from may 1 to october 31 during 2012 and 2019 which included 3 h precipitation data from 17 gauging stations 3 h water surface evaporation and inflow data of the lushui reservoir all data are provided by the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission the areal mean precipitation was obtained by averaging the recorded data from 17 rainfall stations using the thiessen polygon method in this study the dataset collected from 2012 to 2016 was used to train the model training period and the dataset collected from 2017 to 2019 was used to validate the model validation period 3 2 jianxi basin the jianxi river basin with an area of 14 787 km2 a tributary of the minjiang river in fujian province china was also selected as the case study the jianxi basin belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone and its topography is featured by low hills and mountains the annual average temperature rainfall and runoff volume are about 18 c 2 000 mm and 15 8 billion m3 respectively rainfall is mainly concentrated from april to september accounting for 75 up to 80 of the annual precipitation fig 2 c shows the river network and rainfall gauge stations in the jianxi basin referring to zhou et al 2022b for the specific description for the jianxi basin this study collected data series of the flood period spanning from april 1 to september 30 during 2009 and 2013 which included 3 h precipitation data from 16 gauge stations 3 h evaporation data from 3 gauge stations and 3 h flow data of the qilijie hydrological station the areal average precipitation and evaporation data are calculated using the thiessen polygon method the training and validation periods are 2009 2011 and 2012 2013 respectively 3 3 input variable selection in this study we choose rainfall and inflow data as the input features of the neural network our previous study used the cross correlation coefficient ccf between the rainfall and runoff series to estimate the flow concentration time in the lushui basin and found that the flow confluence time was about 12 h cui et al 2021 the correlation coefficients between basin mean precipitation and observed flow for different time lags in the lushui and jianxi basins were plotted in fig 3 which shows the runoff generation and flow confluence times of the lushui and jianxi basins are about 12 h and 21 h respectively according to the runoff generation and the flow confluence time of the lushui and jianxi basins the observed flow and areal mean rainfall for the last 12 h 4 time steps and 21 h 7 time steps are adopted as the inputs of the lstm model respectively all the encoder inputs are the same as those of the lstm model in the lstm red model the encoder input is the input of the entire structure and the decoder input comes from its internal output the decoder input in the lstm ede model is an exogenous input and the target outputs for the lushui and jianxi basins are the observed flow corresponding to the 3 12 h forecast horizons considering the stochastic uncertainty of some internal parameters in the neural network models the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models are run 30 times consecutively the network structures with the best forecast performance are selected for analysis 4 results evaluation four models the xaj lstm lstm red and lstm ede models were established the structure detailed calibration procedures and methods of the xaj model can be referred to in our previous studies cui et al 2021 zhou et al 2022b the evaluation metrics of the four models for flood forecasting during training periods regarding lushui and jianxi basins are listed in table 1 it can be observed that the forecast accuracy decreases significantly with the increase of the forecast horizon the lstm ede model is superior to the other models in the re metric taking the 12 h forecast horizon in the lushui basin as an example the re metrics of xaj lstm and lstm ede models are 30 75 7 32 and 4 17 respectively while the lstm ede model has the lowest re value of 0 75 table 2 summarizes the evaluation metrics of the four models for flood forecasting during validation periods regarding lushui and jianxi basins it can be observed that the xaj model has the worst performance at the 12 h forecast horizon the nse re and rmse metrics are 0 62 28 06 and 169 m3 s respectively for the lushui basin and are 0 85 12 20 and 361 m3 s respectively for the jianxi basin the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models have no significant difference in 3 h forecast horizon starting from the 6 h forecast horizon the evaluation metrics of the lstm model decline significantly especially for the rmse metric at the 12 h forecast horizon the rmse metrics of the lstm and lstm red models are equal to 136 m3 s and 132 m3 s respectively in the lushui basin and equal to 323 m3 s and 293 m3 s respectively in the jianxi basin therefore the performance of the lstm red model is better than those of the lstm and xaj models compared with lstm and lstm red models the lstm ede model has the least degradation in forecast performance for 12 h forecast horizon in the lushui and jianxi basins the nse metric reaches as high as 0 81 and 0 93 respectively the re metric is as low as 0 97 and 2 10 respectively and the rmse metric is as small as 119 m3 s and 254 m3 s respectively it can be observed that the advantages of the lstm ede model are obvious in the 12 h forecast horizon especially in the evaluation metrics of water volume therefore it is concluded that the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance combining tables 1 and 2 it is found that the lstm ede model can significantly improve the forecast accuracy even though the forecast accuracy of the xaj model is relatively poor at the same time the lstm ede model can substantially improve the computational efficiency in the validation process as compared with the lstm red model this is a significant improvement necessary for promoting the ed structure in real time flood forecasting the scatter plots of the xaj lstm lstm red and lstm ede models results for the lushui and jianxi basins are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively it can be visually observed that in the lushui basin the scattering points of all models under the high flow conditions 2500 m3 s are significantly lower than the 1 1 ideal line during the validation period the reason may be that the training data lack high flows causing all models to underestimate high flows in the validation period the scatters of all models for the lushui and jianxi basins gradually disperse as the forecast horizon increases which indicates a gradual decrease in forecast performance the differences in the scatter plots of different models in the lushui basin are relatively obvious the xaj model produces the most scattered points and severely underestimates the observed flows as compared to the other models especially in the 12 h forecast horizon as shown in fig 4 e all the forecasts obtained from the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models stay close to the 1 1 ideal line in the scatter plots on fig 4 b c and d for the 6 h forecast horizon whereas the scatter plots of the three models show different degrees of deterioration for the 12 h forecast horizon fig 4 f g and h the scattered points of the lstm ede model are the closest to the 1 1 ideal line in the 12 h forecast horizon especially under high flow conditions fig 4 h the differences in the scatter plots of different models in the jianxi basin are small in the 12 h forecast horizon the scattered points of the xaj lstm and lstm red models are dispersed in general and the scattered points are generally below the 1 1 ideal line under high flow conditions 6000 m3 s fig 5 e f and g the scatter plot of the lstm ede model has the narrowest band with the scattered points the closest to the 1 1 ideal line fig 5 h therefore it can be concluded that the lstm ede model has the best forecast accuracy and can effectively reduce the forecast error in the long forecast horizon followed by the lstm red and lstm models and the xaj model has the worst performance we randomly selected three flood events in validation periods to further verify the model performance in lushui and jianxi basins respectively a relative error of flood peak pre metric is employed to evaluate the forecast performance and it is calculated by 10 pre q f p e a k q o p e a k q o p e a k 100 where q f p e a k and q o p e a k are the forecasted and observed flood peak flow respectively the forecasted flood hydrographs of the lushui basin are plotted in figs 6 7 and 8 respectively and those of the jianxi basin are plotted in figs 9 10 and 11 respectively tables 3 and 4 summarize the evaluation metrics of the forecasted hydrographs during the 12 h forecast horizon in the lushui and jianxi basins respectively fig 6 shows the observed and forecasted hydrographs of the lushui basin by the four models for the flood event lasting from may 21 at 17 00 to may 25 at 23 00 in 2017 the observed precipitation occurs in the rising limb and is nearly 0 mm in the recession limb as the forecast horizon increases the agreement between observed and forecasted data gradually worsens the irregular fluctuations in the rising limbs of the flood hydrographs may be related to the presence of multiple rainfall peaks the xaj model forecasted an earlier occurrence of flood peaks for the 6 h forecast horizon and severely underestimated the peak volumes in the 12 h forecast horizon the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models have better performance than the xaj model among them the lstm ede model has an advantage in forecasting the rising limb and the occurrence time of the flood peak fig 7 shows the observed and forecasted hydrographs of the lushui basin by the four models for the flood event lasting from may 25 at 17 00 to may 29 at 8 00 in 2019 it can be seen that the observed flood hydrograph rises rapidly due to the relatively concentrated precipitation the xaj model underestimated the flood peak while the lstm and lstm red models overestimated the flood peak the lstm ede model outperforms other models in terms of occurrence timing and magnitude of flood peaks fig 8 shows the observed and forecasted hydrographs by the four models for the flood event lasting from july 12 at 2 00 to july 15 at 14 00 in 2019 the xaj model overestimated the rising limb and the flood peak for the 6 h forecast horizon but underestimated the rising limb and the flood peak in the 12 h forecast horizon the lstm red and lstm ede models performed reasonably well with the lagged occurrence time of the flood peak table 3 reveals that the lstm model has the lowest peak error pre 1 55 while the xaj model has the largest flood peak error pre 43 54 according to the nse re rmse and pre metrics the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance in these flood events followed by the lstm and lstm red models and the xaj model has the lowest forecast accuracy as shown in fig 9 the xaj model underestimated the peak volume for the forecast horizons of the 6 h and 12 h the lstm model showed irregular fluctuations at the flood peak and could not maintain the reasonable shape of the flooding process the lstm red and lstm ede models performed reasonably well in both cases and the lstm ede model has a smaller peak volume error and a more accurate occurrence time of the peak as shown in fig 10 the xaj model underestimated the flood volume and had the largest volume error in both cases in the 12 h forecast horizon the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models underestimated the flood volume in the rising limb meanwhile the lstm red model significantly underestimated the peak volume the lstm and the lstm ede models produced reasonable flood processes and the lstm ede model performs better in forecasting the occurrence time of the flood peak and the recession limb as shown in fig 11 the lstm model showed large fluctuations and had the worst forecast performance the xaj lstm red and lstm ede models generated relatively small volume errors where the xaj and lstm ede models had the best forecast performance table 4 shows that the lstm model has the largest pre value of 56 31 in these flood events and the xaj model has the smallest pre value of 0 25 according to the comprehensive analysis of these three flood events using nse re rmse and pre metrics the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance followed by the lstm red lstm and xaj models 5 discussion this study analyzes and compares the multi step ahead flood forecasting of the xaj model the single output lstm model and the multi output lstm model based on the red and ede structures the single output lstm model adopts a recursive input strategy to achieve multi step ahead flood forecasting although it can rapidly produce flood forecasts at multiple time steps and save the computational cost the training process of the lstm model excludes the recursive process this would cause the parameters such as weights to be obtained only based on the input and output of the first forecast horizon the lstm model can easily convey the forecast error from the previous forecast horizon to the following forecast horizon through the recursive process which is likely to cause a rapid accumulation of forecast errors tran et al 2016 kurian et al 2020 as the forecast horizon increases the lstm model shows substantial deterioration in the nse re and rmse metrics as shown in tables 1 and 2 the nse values during the validation period decreased from 0 98 3 h to 0 75 12 h in the lushui basin while from 0 97 3 h to 0 88 12 h in the jianxi basin table 2 according to tables 1 and 2 it can be observed that the evaluation metrics of the lstm red model decreased less in the 12 h forecast horizon as compared to those of the lstm model this may be attributed to the fact that the lstm red model can complement the input within the forecast horizon through the internal recursive process differing from the single output lstm model the lstm red model can capture the special recurrence relationship in the decoder during the training period the lstm red model is able to consider the total loss function of multiple forecast horizon outputs simultaneously in the single batch and iteratively updates the parameters of the neural network by error back propagation and gradient descent algorithms in other words the lstm red model considers the influence of inputs and outputs of multiple forecast horizons on the network parameters simultaneously which produces more extraordinary generalization performance than the lstm model this makes the model more reasonable and fairer when forecasting in different forecast horizons afterwards the lstm red model can adaptively resolve the relationship between the input and output during different forecast horizons therefore the lstm red model has more advantages than the lstm model for multi step ahead flood forecasting the lstm red model employs a recursive input strategy in the decoding process which is suitable for classification issues such as number recognition and text translation because the output values only need to exist within the target output category and we are not concerned with the true values of the output values however according to the evaluation metrics in tables 1 and 2 the decrease in forecast performance of the lstm red model is greater than that of the lstm ede model this proves that the exposure bias problem within the lstm red model increases the instability of the model and has a degree of negative impact on multi step ahead flood forecasting to better understand the hazards arising from the exposure bias problem we assume that the observed and forecasted flows at t 1 moment are true and true error respectively the input at t 2 moment is true when the neural network is trained but the input at t 2 moment becomes true error during the validation period the increases in the forecast horizon inevitably led to the accumulation of errors in other words the lstm red model is unable to consider the relationship between input error and target output when training the neural network this problem may become progressively more pronounced as the forecast horizon extends it can be observed from tables 1 and 2 that the flood error metrics e g re and rmse for the lstm red model become rapidly large with the increase in the forecast horizon which leads to poor forecast accuracy for long forecast horizons e g 12 h as shown in the previous section the lstm ede model outperforms the xaj lstm and lstm red models according to the evaluation metrics especially for the flood volume error metrics this may be because the lstm ede model can consider the relationship between the forecast error of the xaj model and the target output during the training period and is able to make a positive response in parameters such as the weights within the neural network furthermore the lstm ede model can rely on the forecasted flow of the xaj model to construct the connection between the input and the target output therefore it avoids the recursive process in the decoder of the lstm red model and overcomes the inconsistency between the training and validation processes which can guarantee or even improve forecast accuracy meanwhile the lstm ede model simplifies the decoding process and improves the computational efficiency in summary the lstm ede model is more suitable for long horizon flood forecasting nevertheless the lstm ede model is influenced by the accuracy of the exogenous input as shown in tables 1 and 2 the forecast accuracy of the xaj model gradually decreases as the forecast horizon increases and the forecast performance of the lstm ede model gradually deteriorates in this case an attempt can be made to improve the forecast accuracy of the exogenous input series by considering the numerical precipitation forecast in the xaj model meanwhile due to the limited availability of hourly observation data the applicability of the lstm ede model is only discussed in two basins in china we will consider the lstm ede model s effectiveness at a large temporal spatial scale in subsequent studies 6 conclusions in this study a novel encoder decoder structure with an exogenous input ede structure was proposed and the framework for coupling forecasted flow discharge from the process based model e g the xaj model was also investigated the proposed lstm ede model was compared with xaj lstm and lstm red models and verified in the lushui and jianxi basins the main findings were summarized as follows 1 through the evaluation of the forecast performance of the xaj lstm lstm red and lstm ede models we conclude that the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance followed by the lstm red lstm and xaj models the difference between the single output lstm model and the lstm red model is that the lstm red model can integrate a recursive strategy into the training process 2 the lstm red model gradually deteriorates in the flood volume error metrics re and rmse as the forecast horizon increases the exposure bias problem of the lstm red model has a negative impact on forecasting with long forecast horizons and increases the computation time in the validation process 3 the lstm ede model fuses the forecasted flow of the xaj model in the decoder which overcomes the exposure bias problem and simplifies the decoding process of the lstm red model as a result it achieves better forecast results and effectively improves the computational efficiency in the validation process therefore it is more suitable for multi step ahead flood forecasting future research can be carried out to explore the far reaching effects of medium and long term numerical weather forecast products or other effective meteorological forcing factors on the performance of the proposed approach for improving reservoir operation and water resources management cao et al 2017 ha et al 2021 and it calls for further evaluation of the applicability of the lstm ede model in more basins e g camels dataset in the globe furthermore the advanced uncertainty analysis method can

and improve the multi step ahead flood forecasting accuracy as compared to the lstm red model keywords flood forecasting multi step ahead neural network deep learning encoder decoder exogenous input 1 introduction reliable and accurate flood forecasts are essential for reservoir operations especially for flood control power generation and navigation zhu et al 2020 lin et al 2020 chen et al 2020 gauch et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022a many methods or models have been developed to simulate rainfall runoff processes for flood forecasting which are broadly classified into two categories process based models and data driven models samaniego et al 2010 birkel and soulsby 2015 eslamian et al 2018b seibert et al 2018 chen et al 2020 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 filipova et al 2022 ridolfi et al 2021 li et al 2021a process based models consider the causal mechanisms of rainfall runoff transformation and generalize complex hydrological phenomena to a certain extent and therefore play a dominant role in real time flood forecasting zhao 1992 guo et al 2004 chen et al 2020 eslamian et al 2018a beylich et al 2021 however the rainfall runoff transformation process is accompanied by nonlinear and non stationary characteristics and it is difficult for process based models to simulate the complex hydrologic process comprehensively data driven models the deep learning model based on the long short term memory lstm neural network benefit from their adeptness in extracting intrinsic connections from big data to effectively simulate complex systems with nonlinear and non stationary characteristics shortridge et al 2016 granata et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2017 yan et al 2018 hu et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 artificial neural networks anns one of the representative data driven models have been successfully applied to rainfall runoff simulation for many years young et al 2017 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021a anns are able to extract useful information from observed data and have proved their effectiveness in dealing with nonlinear non smooth series problems ha stenstrom 2003 chang et al 2014 chang et al 2015 chang tsai 2016 wang et al 2021 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021b with the maturity of computer technology and hardware facilities the deep neural network dnn technology based on anns has gained broad attention tennant et al 2020 compared with the simple ann one of dnns obvious advantages is that they can consider the correlation between input variables at adjacent moments in one two or even higher dimensions and capture the dependencies among variables zhou 2020 this characteristic is beneficial for tackling time series prediction with first order or higher order markov property kratzert et al 2018 one of the most representative dnn techniques is the deep learning technique based on lstm neural networks the lstm neural network proposed by hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 is a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns which overcomes the problems such as gradient explosion or disappearance occurring in rnn zhou 2020 it not only effectively memorizes information from previous time steps but also achieves parameter sharing in neural networks of different time steps which enables a reduction in the computational cost and is very advantageous to process time correlated data series thus deep learning models based on lstm neural networks have been applied to hydrologic forecasting kratzert et al 2018 used the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset to validate the effectiveness of lstm in rainfall runoff modeling and found the lstm neural network could obtain better performance when used as the regional hydrological model hu et al 2018 investigated the performance of lstm in rainfall runoff simulation and found that the lstm outperformed the ann with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse exceeding 0 9 gao et al 2020 studied the effect of the time step length on forecast accuracy and found that the lstm neural network could improve forecast accuracy as the time step increases however an lstm model depends on a large amount of data easily leading to overfitting in particular flood forecast accuracy decreases as the forecast horizon increases due to insufficient input variables with long periods although there are some studies that take the output of the previous forecast horizon as the input of the following forecast horizon i e recursive strategy this measure tends to cause the transmission and accumulation of forecast errors young et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 kurian et al 2020 in order to improve the accuracy and applicability of the lstm neural network in multi step ahead flood forecasting some studies fused a process based model with the lstm neural network in an attempt to compensate each other s inherent limitations zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2022b the fusion approach generally takes the output of the process based model as an additional feature input to the lstm neural network some studies have conducted the runoff simulation to explore the effectiveness of this fusion approach for instance yang et al 2019 constructed a hybrid physics machine learning model by taking temperature precipitation wind speed and the simulated flow of the ghms cama flood model chain as inputs to the lstm neural network for simulating global floods they concluded that the hybrid model could significantly improve the accuracy of global flood simulations konapala et al 2020 proposed a hybrid model using the simulated flows from the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac model as inputs of the lstm neural network for simulating runoff of 531 watersheds under different conditions they concluded that the hybrid model could combine the advantages of sac and lstm models and improve the simulation accuracy cui et al 2021 constructed a hybrid xaj lstm model that integrated the xinanjiang xaj model into the lstm neural network for multi step ahead flood forecasting they found that the hybrid model could obtain more accurate long lead time forecasts than the xaj and lstm models which promotes the transformation of this fusion approach from the theoretical simulation to multi step ahead flood forecasting in practice with the development of artificial intelligence technology the encoder decoder ed structure is developed to solve the sequence to sequence problem emerging in the natural language processing the ed structure combined with a deep learning model enables multi step output under the premise of considering the correlation of time series and achieves the best translation results sutskever et al 2014 cho et al 2014 the encoding process extracts critical information from the input features in multiple time steps and information compression kao et al 2020 yin et al 2021 the medium vector connecting the encoder and decoder processes is the hidden layer output of the last time step in the encoding process which contains the critical information extracted from the input features the decoding process is to transform the medium vector into the target output the ed structure is sensitive to the order of the input sequence and can consider the temporal association among sequences therefore the ed structure is suitable for tackling sequence to sequence problems and can directly produce multiple outputs corresponding to multiple time steps ha et al 2021 the streamflow sequences are continuously varying time series with strong autocorrelation and therefore the ed structure is suitable for handling multi step ahead flood forecasting the common ed structures in hydrological forecasting can be roughly divided into two types the first type is the recursive encoder decoder red structure proposed by cho et al 2014 where the input of each time step in the decoding process consists of the medium vector and the output value of the previous time step the second type is the static encoder decoder sed structure where only the medium vector is used as the input to each time step of the decoding process xiang and demir 2020a han et al 2021 xiang et al 2020b applied the sed structure coupled with the lstm neural network lstm sed model to hourly flood forecasting in the clear creek and upper wapsipinicon river watersheds in iowa usa with a comparison of common machine learning models such as linear regression lasso regression and ridge regression the observed and forecasted precipitation previously observed flow monthly evapotranspiration and upstream forecast data were used as inputs to the ed structure they confirmed that the proposed lstm sed model could improve the accuracy of short term flood forecasts kao et al 2020 used the red structure combined with the lstm neural network lstm red model for 1 6 h flood forecasting in the shimen reservoir watershed the inputs to the ed structure included the previously observed flow discharges and precipitation only they demonstrated that the lstm red model could obtain accurate multi step ahead flood forecasts and reduce the root mean square error rmse by 3 38 during the testing period compared with an ed model based on feed forward neural network ffnn red model han et al 2021 constructed an lstm sed model to forecast floods in the russian river basin of northern california usa observed flow data at the outlet point and four upstream stations were used as inputs to the ed structure their results show that the lstm sed model performs well with nse values ranging from 0 97 to 0 99 and correlation coefficient r metrics ranging from 0 98 to 0 99 at 1 6 h forecast horizons ha et al 2021 developed three dnn models i e lstm conv lstm and gate recurrent unit gru neural networks based on the red structure and applied them to the yangtze river basin based on el niño southern oscillation and monthly flood data they found that the conv lstm neural network could improve the stability of the ed structure and produce the best forecasting results with the r index exceeding 0 8 and the rmse index below 8000 m3 s meanwhile the introduction of the oscillation factor could improve the forecast accuracy of flood peaks and flood occurrence times yin et al 2021 improved the sed structure and developed an lstm based multi state vector sequence to sequence rainfall runoff model as well as compared it with the models proposed by xiang et al 2020b and kao et al 2020 the model used multi state vectors for multi step ahead runoff forecasting where observed and forecasted meteorological materials such as daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and vapor pressure and previously observed runoff were employed as inputs to the ed structure their experiments in 673 watersheds showed that the proposed model could improve the forecast accuracy for 7d forecast horizon of the benchmark model and therefore is suitable for multi day ahead runoff forecasting although the above studies demonstrated that neural networks combining ed structures could achieve more accurate multi step ahead flood forecasts the recursive process problems and limitations of the red structure have not been discussed the following research questions need to be answered which motivated the current study and formed the research objectives first what is the difference between the lstm red model and the single output lstm model with a recursive process second what are the advantages and disadvantages of the lstm red model considering recursive processes for multi step ahead flood forecasting finally can the disadvantages of the lstm red model be solved by the above mentioned fusion approach the following research work is carried out to achieve the objectives 1 explore the differences between the lstm red model and the lstm model with a recursive process as well as analyze the impact of the recursive process within the lstm red model on multi step ahead flood forecast accuracy from different perspectives 2 fuse the flow forecasts from the xaj model into the lstm ed model in an attempt to solve the disadvantages of the lstm red model to the best of the authors knowledge this fusion approach focusing on combining process based models with the single output lstm neural network has not been considered so far in the ed structure models therefore the novelty of this study is that an innovative ed structure with an exogenous input ede is proposed for the first time by considering the forecasted flow of the xaj model as the exogenous input variable the lstm neural network is integrated into the ede structure to build the lstm ede model the lushui and jianxi basins in china are selected as the case studies to conduct the multi step ahead flood forecasting and to demonstrate the improvement in the applicability of emerging artificial intelligence techniques the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed methods and approaches section 3 briefly introduces the case study and materials section 4 evaluates and analyzes the results of the models adopted for multi step ahead flood forecasting section 5 provides a discussion based on the forecast results conclusions are then given in section 6 2 methods this study proposes a novel lstm ede model which is compared with the xaj lstm and lstm red models the frameworks of the red and ede structures are presented in fig 1 2 1 recursive encoder decoder red structure the red structure in fig 1 a was proposed by cho et al 2014 where the input of each time step of the decoding process consists of a medium vector and the output value of the previous moment like the strategy of recursive feedback input the highlighted arrow in the fig 1 a indicates the recursive feedback input process through the recursive process the decoding process in the red structure can receive not only the important information extracted from the encoding process but also the changing information from the previous moment during the training period the decoding process of the red structure does not employ a recursive input strategy but employs the target output of the previous moment i e the target output observed flow at t 1 moment is used as the input at t 2 moment also known as the teacher forcing mechanism toomarian barhen 1992 during the validation period also known as the inference process bengio et al 2015 the decoding process of the red structure adopts the recursive input strategy because of the unavailability of the observed flows in the forecast horizon i e the output forecasted flow at t 1 moment is used as the input at t 2 moment this is the reason for the inconsistency between training and validation processes of the red structure the problem is called exposure bias in natural language processing zhang et al 2019 meanwhile it is found from fig 1 a that the recursive input strategy complicates the inference process we will analyze the characteristics of the red structure from different perspectives in the subsequent sections 2 2 encoder decoder with an exogenous input ede structure we propose the encoder decoder with an exogenous input ede structure and specify the exogenous input from the forecasted flow sequence of the process based model the ede structure allows the decoding process to receive information associated with the target output and helps the decoder capture the connection between the input and the target output the length of the exogenous input should be equal to the maximum forecasting period the ede structure takes the medium vector and the exogenous input as the inputs for each time step of the decoding process and the structure is shown in fig 1 b the input of the decoder in the ede structure is always the forecasted flows of the process based model and the medium vector during training and validation processes therefore the training and validation processes remain consistent the ede structure has another advantage of simplifying the recursive process and is beneficial to the computational efficiency of the inference process the most critical difference between red and ede structures is the input factor of the decoding process i e the input in the decoding process of the ede structure is changed to the exogenous input instead of the output value of the previous moment 2 3 long short term memory lstm neural network unit the lstm neural network consists of a forgetting gate an input gate and an output gate each gate of the lstm neural network connects the information of the input layer and the output

denotes the sigmoid activation function t a n h denotes the tangent s curve activation function denotes the hadamard product the single output lstm model adopts a recursive input strategy zhou et al 2019 xu et al 2021 to calculate the multi step ahead flood forecasts in training and validation periods i e the forecast results of the previous forecast horizon are used as the input to the neural network of the following forecast horizon the lstm model trains the neural network structure by means of multiple inputs and single outputs after acquiring an excellent network structure the recursive input strategy is employed for multi step ahead flood forecasting lstm neural network units are integrated into red and ede structures to construct lstm red and lstm ede models respectively we employ a fault testing method to determine the relevant hyperparameters of the neural network models one layer with 64 hidden units neurons of the lstm neural network is adopted in both the encoder and the decoder the single output lstm model adopts a two layer structure with 64 hidden units in each layer the loss function is the mean square error meanwhile the adam optimization method in tensorflow keras optimizers is applied to training the model and its parameters are set to be default values learning rate 0 001 beta 1 0 9 beta 2 0 999 epsilon 1e 07 li et al 2021b the batch size and epochs are set to be 100 and 500 respectively 2 4 evaluation of model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 the relative error of total streamflow re and the root mean square error

lushui basin the lushui river with a watershed area of about 3950 km2 is a first class tributary of the middle reaches of the yangtze river as shown in fig 2 b the topography of the basin is high in the southeast and low in the northwest this basin belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone with a warm climate and its annual average temperature rainfall and runoff volume are about 15 5 c 1 550 mm and 3 03 billion m3 respectively the rainy season generally concentrates in april september accounting for 70 of the annual rainfall the lushui reservoir is located at the outlet of the valley of the mainstream the effective storage capacity of the lushui reservoir is about 408 million m3 with a flood prevention storage of only about 163 million m3 since the small and medium sized mountainous basins are often characterized by concentrated precipitation and fast runoff production as well as easy to cause flood disasters accurate flood forecasts can provide the reservoir important guidance for controlling river water levels and preventing flood due to the limitation of a small flood prevention storage capacity accurate multi step ahead inflow forecasts are crucial for flood control and water resources management of the lushui reservoir this study collected data series during the wet period spanning from may 1 to october 31 during 2012 and 2019 which included 3 h precipitation data from 17 gauging stations 3 h water surface evaporation and inflow data of the lushui reservoir all data are provided by the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission the areal mean precipitation was obtained by averaging the recorded data from 17 rainfall stations using the thiessen polygon method in this study the dataset collected from 2012 to 2016 was used to train the model training period and the dataset collected from 2017 to 2019 was used to validate the model validation period 3 2 jianxi basin the jianxi river basin with an area of 14 787 km2 a tributary of the minjiang river in fujian province china was also selected as the case study the jianxi basin belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone and its topography is featured by low hills and mountains the annual average temperature rainfall and runoff volume are about 18 c 2 000 mm and 15 8 billion m3 respectively rainfall is mainly concentrated from april to september accounting for 75 up to 80 of the annual precipitation fig 2 c shows the river network and rainfall gauge stations in the jianxi basin referring to zhou et al 2022b for the specific description for the jianxi basin this study collected data series of the flood period spanning from april 1 to september 30 during 2009 and 2013 which included 3 h precipitation data from 16 gauge stations 3 h evaporation data from 3 gauge stations and 3 h flow data of the qilijie hydrological station the areal average precipitation and evaporation data are calculated using the thiessen polygon method the training and validation periods are 2009 2011 and 2012 2013 respectively 3 3 input variable selection in this study we choose rainfall and inflow data as the input features of the neural network our previous study used the cross correlation coefficient ccf between the rainfall and runoff series to estimate the flow concentration time in the lushui basin and found that the flow confluence time was about 12 h cui et al 2021 the correlation coefficients between basin mean precipitation and observed flow for different time lags in the lushui and jianxi basins were plotted in fig 3 which shows the runoff generation and flow confluence times of the lushui and jianxi basins are about 12 h and 21 h respectively according to the runoff generation and the flow confluence time of the lushui and jianxi basins the observed flow and areal mean rainfall for the last 12 h 4 time steps and 21 h 7 time steps are adopted as the inputs of the lstm model respectively all the encoder inputs are the same as those of the lstm model in the lstm red model the encoder input is the input of the entire structure and the decoder input comes from its internal output the decoder input in the lstm ede model is an exogenous input and the target outputs for the lushui and jianxi basins are the observed flow corresponding to the 3 12 h forecast horizons considering the stochastic uncertainty of some internal parameters in the neural network models the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models are run 30 times consecutively the network structures with the best forecast performance are selected for analysis 4 results evaluation four models the xaj lstm lstm red and lstm ede models were established the structure detailed calibration procedures and methods of the xaj model can be referred to in our previous studies cui et al 2021 zhou et al 2022b the evaluation metrics of the four models for flood forecasting during training periods regarding lushui and jianxi basins are listed in table 1 it can be observed that the forecast accuracy decreases significantly with the increase of the forecast horizon the lstm ede model is superior to the other models in the re metric taking the 12 h forecast horizon in the lushui basin as an example the re metrics of xaj lstm and lstm ede models are 30 75 7 32 and 4 17 respectively while the lstm ede model has the lowest re value of 0 75 table 2 summarizes the evaluation metrics of the four models for flood forecasting during validation periods regarding lushui and jianxi basins it can be observed that the xaj model has the worst performance at the 12 h forecast horizon the nse re and rmse metrics are 0 62 28 06 and 169 m3 s respectively for the lushui basin and are 0 85 12 20 and 361 m3 s respectively for the jianxi basin the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models have no significant difference in 3 h forecast horizon starting from the 6 h forecast horizon the evaluation metrics of the lstm model decline significantly especially for the rmse metric at the 12 h forecast horizon the rmse metrics of the lstm and lstm red models are equal to 136 m3 s and 132 m3 s respectively in the lushui basin and equal to 323 m3 s and 293 m3 s respectively in the jianxi basin therefore the performance of the lstm red model is better than those of the lstm and xaj models compared with lstm and lstm red models the lstm ede model has the least degradation in forecast performance for 12 h forecast horizon in the lushui and jianxi basins the nse metric reaches as high as 0 81 and 0 93 respectively the re metric is as low as 0 97 and 2 10 respectively and the rmse metric is as small as 119 m3 s and 254 m3 s respectively it can be observed that the advantages of the lstm ede model are obvious in the 12 h forecast horizon especially in the evaluation metrics of water volume therefore it is concluded that the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance combining tables 1 and 2 it is found that the lstm ede model can significantly improve the forecast accuracy even though the forecast accuracy of the xaj model is relatively poor at the same time the lstm ede model can substantially improve the computational efficiency in the validation process as compared with the lstm red model this is a significant improvement necessary for promoting the ed structure in real time flood forecasting the scatter plots of the xaj lstm lstm red and lstm ede models results for the lushui and jianxi basins are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively it can be visually observed that in the lushui basin the scattering points of all models under the high flow conditions 2500 m3 s are significantly lower than the 1 1 ideal line during the validation period the reason may be that the training data lack high flows causing all models to underestimate high flows in the validation period the scatters of all models for the lushui and jianxi basins gradually disperse as the forecast horizon increases which indicates a gradual decrease in forecast performance the differences in the scatter plots of different models in the lushui basin are relatively obvious the xaj model produces the most scattered points and severely underestimates the observed flows as compared to the other models especially in the 12 h forecast horizon as shown in fig 4 e all the forecasts obtained from the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models stay close to the 1 1 ideal line in the scatter plots on fig 4 b c and d for the 6 h forecast horizon whereas the scatter plots of the three models show different degrees of deterioration for the 12 h forecast horizon fig 4 f g and h the scattered points of the lstm ede model are the closest to the 1 1 ideal line in the 12 h forecast horizon especially under high flow conditions fig 4 h the differences in the scatter plots of different models in the jianxi basin are small in the 12 h forecast horizon the scattered points of the xaj lstm and lstm red models are dispersed in general and the scattered points are generally below the 1 1 ideal line under high flow conditions 6000 m3 s fig 5 e f and g the scatter plot of the lstm ede model has the narrowest band with the scattered points the closest to the 1 1 ideal line fig 5 h therefore it can be concluded that the lstm ede model has the best forecast accuracy and can effectively reduce the forecast error in the long forecast horizon followed by the lstm red and lstm models and the xaj model has the worst performance we randomly selected three flood events in validation periods to further verify the model performance in lushui and jianxi basins respectively a relative error of flood peak pre metric is employed to evaluate the forecast performance and it is calculated by 10 pre q f p e a k q o p e a k q o p e a k 100 where q f p e a k and q o p e a k are the forecasted and observed flood peak flow respectively the forecasted flood hydrographs of the lushui basin are plotted in figs 6 7 and 8 respectively and those of the jianxi basin are plotted in figs 9 10 and 11 respectively tables 3 and 4 summarize the evaluation metrics of the forecasted hydrographs during the 12 h forecast horizon in the lushui and jianxi basins respectively fig 6 shows the observed and forecasted hydrographs of the lushui basin by the four models for the flood event lasting from may 21 at 17 00 to may 25 at 23 00 in 2017 the observed precipitation occurs in the rising limb and is nearly 0 mm in the recession limb as the forecast horizon increases the agreement between observed and forecasted data gradually worsens the irregular fluctuations in the rising limbs of the flood hydrographs may be related to the presence of multiple rainfall peaks the xaj model forecasted an earlier occurrence of flood peaks for the 6 h forecast horizon and severely underestimated the peak volumes in the 12 h forecast horizon the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models have better performance than the xaj model among them the lstm ede model has an advantage in forecasting the rising limb and the occurrence time of the flood peak fig 7 shows the observed and forecasted hydrographs of the lushui basin by the four models for the flood event lasting from may 25 at 17 00 to may 29 at 8 00 in 2019 it can be seen that the observed flood hydrograph rises rapidly due to the relatively concentrated precipitation the xaj model underestimated the flood peak while the lstm and lstm red models overestimated the flood peak the lstm ede model outperforms other models in terms of occurrence timing and magnitude of flood peaks fig 8 shows the observed and forecasted hydrographs by the four models for the flood event lasting from july 12 at 2 00 to july 15 at 14 00 in 2019 the xaj model overestimated the rising limb and the flood peak for the 6 h forecast horizon but underestimated the rising limb and the flood peak in the 12 h forecast horizon the lstm red and lstm ede models performed reasonably well with the lagged occurrence time of the flood peak table 3 reveals that the lstm model has the lowest peak error pre 1 55 while the xaj model has the largest flood peak error pre 43 54 according to the nse re rmse and pre metrics the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance in these flood events followed by the lstm and lstm red models and the xaj model has the lowest forecast accuracy as shown in fig 9 the xaj model underestimated the peak volume for the forecast horizons of the 6 h and 12 h the lstm model showed irregular fluctuations at the flood peak and could not maintain the reasonable shape of the flooding process the lstm red and lstm ede models performed reasonably well in both cases and the lstm ede model has a smaller peak volume error and a more accurate occurrence time of the peak as shown in fig 10 the xaj model underestimated the flood volume and had the largest volume error in both cases in the 12 h forecast horizon the lstm lstm red and lstm ede models underestimated the flood volume in the rising limb meanwhile the lstm red model significantly underestimated the peak volume the lstm and the lstm ede models produced reasonable flood processes and the lstm ede model performs better in forecasting the occurrence time of the flood peak and the recession limb as shown in fig 11 the lstm model showed large fluctuations and had the worst forecast performance the xaj lstm red and lstm ede models generated relatively small volume errors where the xaj and lstm ede models had the best forecast performance table 4 shows that the lstm model has the largest pre value of 56 31 in these flood events and the xaj model has the smallest pre value of 0 25 according to the comprehensive analysis of these three flood events using nse re rmse and pre metrics the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance followed by the lstm red lstm and xaj models 5 discussion this study analyzes and compares the multi step ahead flood forecasting of the xaj model the single output lstm model and the multi output lstm model based on the red and ede structures the single output lstm model adopts a recursive input strategy to achieve multi step ahead flood forecasting although it can rapidly produce flood forecasts at multiple time steps and save the computational cost the training process of the lstm model excludes the recursive process this would cause the parameters such as weights to be obtained only based on the input and output of the first forecast horizon the lstm model can easily convey the forecast error from the previous forecast horizon to the following forecast horizon through the recursive process which is likely to cause a rapid accumulation of forecast errors tran et al 2016 kurian et al 2020 as the forecast horizon increases the lstm model shows substantial deterioration in the nse re and rmse metrics as shown in tables 1 and 2 the nse values during the validation period decreased from 0 98 3 h to 0 75 12 h in the lushui basin while from 0 97 3 h to 0 88 12 h in the jianxi basin table 2 according to tables 1 and 2 it can be observed that the evaluation metrics of the lstm red model decreased less in the 12 h forecast horizon as compared to those of the lstm model this may be attributed to the fact that the lstm red model can complement the input within the forecast horizon through the internal recursive process differing from the single output lstm model the lstm red model can capture the special recurrence relationship in the decoder during the training period the lstm red model is able to consider the total loss function of multiple forecast horizon outputs simultaneously in the single batch and iteratively updates the parameters of the neural network by error back propagation and gradient descent algorithms in other words the lstm red model considers the influence of inputs and outputs of multiple forecast horizons on the network parameters simultaneously which produces more extraordinary generalization performance than the lstm model this makes the model more reasonable and fairer when forecasting in different forecast horizons afterwards the lstm red model can adaptively resolve the relationship between the input and output during different forecast horizons therefore the lstm red model has more advantages than the lstm model for multi step ahead flood forecasting the lstm red model employs a recursive input strategy in the decoding process which is suitable for classification issues such as number recognition and text translation because the output values only need to exist within the target output category and we are not concerned with the true values of the output values however according to the evaluation metrics in tables 1 and 2 the decrease in forecast performance of the lstm red model is greater than that of the lstm ede model this proves that the exposure bias problem within the lstm red model increases the instability of the model and has a degree of negative impact on multi step ahead flood forecasting to better understand the hazards arising from the exposure bias problem we assume that the observed and forecasted flows at t 1 moment are true and true error respectively the input at t 2 moment is true when the neural network is trained but the input at t 2 moment becomes true error during the validation period the increases in the forecast horizon inevitably led to the accumulation of errors in other words the lstm red model is unable to consider the relationship between input error and target output when training the neural network this problem may become progressively more pronounced as the forecast horizon extends it can be observed from tables 1 and 2 that the flood error metrics e g re and rmse for the lstm red model become rapidly large with the increase in the forecast horizon which leads to poor forecast accuracy for long forecast horizons e g 12 h as shown in the previous section the lstm ede model outperforms the xaj lstm and lstm red models according to the evaluation metrics especially for the flood volume error metrics this may be because the lstm ede model can consider the relationship between the forecast error of the xaj model and the target output during the training period and is able to make a positive response in parameters such as the weights within the neural network furthermore the lstm ede model can rely on the forecasted flow of the xaj model to construct the connection between the input and the target output therefore it avoids the recursive process in the decoder of the lstm red model and overcomes the inconsistency between the training and validation processes which can guarantee or even improve forecast accuracy meanwhile the lstm ede model simplifies the decoding process and improves the computational efficiency in summary the lstm ede model is more suitable for long horizon flood forecasting nevertheless the lstm ede model is influenced by the accuracy of the exogenous input as shown in tables 1 and 2 the forecast accuracy of the xaj model gradually decreases as the forecast horizon increases and the forecast performance of the lstm ede model gradually deteriorates in this case an attempt can be made to improve the forecast accuracy of the exogenous input series by considering the numerical precipitation forecast in the xaj model meanwhile due to the limited availability of hourly observation data the applicability of the lstm ede model is only discussed in two basins in china we will consider the lstm ede model s effectiveness at a large temporal spatial scale in subsequent studies 6 conclusions in this study a novel encoder decoder structure with an exogenous input ede structure was proposed and the framework for coupling forecasted flow discharge from the process based model e g the xaj model was also investigated the proposed lstm ede model was compared with xaj lstm and lstm red models and verified in the lushui and jianxi basins the main findings were summarized as follows 1 through the evaluation of the forecast performance of the xaj lstm lstm red and lstm ede models we conclude that the lstm ede model has the best forecast performance followed by the lstm red lstm and xaj models the difference between the single output lstm model and the lstm red model is that the lstm red model can integrate a recursive strategy into the training process 2 the lstm red model gradually deteriorates in the flood volume error metrics re and rmse as the forecast horizon increases the exposure bias problem of the lstm red model has a negative impact on forecasting with long forecast horizons and increases the computation time in the validation process 3 the lstm ede model fuses the forecasted flow of the xaj model in the decoder which overcomes the exposure bias problem and simplifies the decoding process of the lstm red model as a result it achieves better forecast results and effectively improves the computational efficiency in the validation process therefore it is more suitable for multi step ahead flood forecasting future research can be carried out to explore the far reaching effects of medium and long term numerical weather forecast products or other effective meteorological forcing factors on the performance of the proposed approach for improving reservoir operation and water resources management cao et al 2017 ha et al 2021 and it calls for further evaluation of the applicability of the lstm ede model in more basins e g camels dataset in the globe furthermore the advanced uncertainty analysis method can further enhance the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach for multi step ahead flood forecasting credit authorship contribution statement zhen cui conceptualization formal analysis

3426,the redox conditions strongly affect redox kinetics hydrochemical composition and microbial reactions under river bank filtration rbf for investigating the redox conditions zonation factors and microbial responses in a typical rbf with high fe2 and mn2 contents three wells were established 20 m apart perpendicular to the south bank of the songhua river with a constant flow rate of 400 m3 h redox zonation was identified from the redox sequences redox products reactions identified and seasonality high throughput sequencing principal coordinates analysis and redundancy analysis were used to identify the microbial responses to redox zonation the results indicated that the rbf was stabilized after 21 d of water extraction with a 51 36 and 21 decrease of fe2 mn2 and nh4 contents respectively feature redox indices varied with strong regularity in the horizontal and vertical filtration directions and the filtration area could be divided into o2 no3 fe mn and so4 2 reduction zones seasonality resulted in markedly fluctuation of fe2 and mn2 contents in groundwater pseudomonas flavobacterium and limnobacter were the dominant bacteria in the o2 no3 fe mn and so4 2 reduction zones respectively do explained 21 1 of microbial variability in the fluctuation zone while mn2 and fe2 explained 27 7 and 26 2 respectively of microbial variability in the saturated zone keywords river bank filtration groundwater redox conditions and zonation seasonality microbial responses 1 introduction river bank filtration rbf is used around the world to sustainably produce drinking water hiscock and grischek 2002 eckert and irmscher 2006 zhu et al 2020 surface groundwater interactions are important to river bank filtration system vogt et al 2010 gillefalk et al 2019 gutiérrez et al 2018 kuehn and mueller 2000 goldschneider et al 2007 however surface water and groundwater have different physical chemical and biological properties this causes a series of redox reactions and the degradation of organic matter henzler et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2016a and clear redox zonation therefore forms in the filtration zone postma and jakobsen 1996 massmann et al 2004 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 burke et al 2014 it has been found that the redox conditions in the filtration zone strongly affect water quality components kazak and pozdniakov 2021 abdelrady et al 2020a the redox kinetics schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 oberleitner et al 2020 singh et al 2010 bertelkamp et al 2016b and the removal efficiencies of many trace organic compounds burke et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2014 abdelrady et al 2019 the redox conditions however is commonly described with oxidation reduction potential orp or electrical potential eh in present studies henzler et al 2016 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 describing redox conditions with single index is flexible but easily misjudged and more factors controlling redox conditions needed to be taken into account the redox conditions in the filtration zone largely depend on the ambient groundwater quality sahu et al 2019 and certain groundwater components could indicate certain redox conditions farnsworth and hering 2011 abdelrady et al 2020a abdelrady et al 2020b lee et al 2020 o connor et al 2015 for example fe2 is relatively widely found in groundwater because groundwater is usually a reducing environment dissolution of manganese minerals however is strongly affected by the acidity and mn2 has a low ph threshold so the fe reduction zone is usually wider than the mn reduction zone matsunaga et al 1993 snyder et al 2004 changes in the aquifer structure and mineral composition temperature and hydrodynamic conditions of the infiltration path can also cause redox zonation sanz prat et al 2020 yakushev et al 2009 munz et al 2019 found that the degradation rates of several organic micropollutants during rbf were mostly controlled by the redox conditions and temperature and that the temperature markedly affected the ranges of the most reactive oxidation zones wang et al 2020 found that differences in hydrodynamic conditions caused differences in riverbed sediment lithology in the liaohe river and therefore affected redox reactions during rbf different redox conditions therefore can be identified by variations in relative geological characteristics microbial activity is another non negligible factor that affects redox zonation microorganisms successively consume dissolved oxygen do no3 fe3 so4 2 and co2 in groundwater to generate reducing substances such as no2 fe2 and hs during the rbf evolution process bai et al 2020 bethke et al 2008 komlos et al 2008 this causes redox gradients and changes the microorganism community structure and diversity in the filtration zone griebler and avramov 2015 mansour et al 2018 causing certain bacterial genera to become dominant by causing some degree of microorganism selection hoffmann and gunkel 2011 fillinger et al 2021 bertelkamp et al 2016c langenheder and lindström 2019 different redox conditions therefore can be assessed by measuring certain hydrochemical geochemical and biogeochemical indicators as mentioned above some scholars have defined redox zonation more scientifically using such indices lyngkilde and christensen 1992 established zonation thresholds using thermodynamic principles and identified various redox zones in the vejen landfill in denmark zhang et al 2021 established a quantitative redox zonation model suitable for hydrocarbon contaminated aquifers and extended it to other aquifers in which similar microbial mechanisms occur a systematic method therefore is expected to be proposed from multiple indicators charactering redox conditions and defining redox zonation more intuitively and scientifically the main objective of the manuscript was to study redox conditions redox zonation and microbial responses during rbf process with high contents of fe2 and mn2 the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of redox conditions during the complete hydrological year were quantified by using hydrochemical indicator in river water and groundwater redox zonation were then divided by combining seasonality the sequence products of redox reactions and the threshold of redox indices the microbial community and diversity data in soils were used as biogeochemical indicator to verify redox zonation this work helps to control the redox conditions of songhua river and provide a systematic method for rbf redox analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location and hydrogeological conditions the study area is in the northwestern part of harbin city in northeastern china fig 1 a the annual average temperature at the study area is 3 5 c the annual average rainfall is 505 4 mm and annual evaporation is 1411 19 mm the study area is on the songhua river floodplain and songhua river flows through the study area from southwest to northeast the river has a water surface width of 200 400 m and water depth of 1 4 7 m the average annual maximum water level is 116 80 m above sea level the average annual water level fluctuates between 115 23 and 116 80 m a variation of 1 57 m with a long term average of 115 86 m the average annual run off of the river is 33 3 109 m3 with an average run off depth of 85 5 mm the groundwater is mainly in a quaternary porous phreatic aquifer 40 50 m thick fig 1b the top of the aquifer is a discontinuous layer of fine yellow sand at a depth of between 1 and 3 m with well sorted and poor roundness a grayish yellow and grayish white gravel layer at 3 11 m deep is sandwiched between a thin silty clay layer and a lens layer a continuous sand and gravel layer that is poorly sorted and contains subangular particles is at 12 42 m deep black and gray silty clays alternate with gravel and coarse sand between 43 and 50 m deep gray green bedrock with an argillaceous structure and no fractures is below 50 m there are discontinuous silty clay layers within each layer the layers have close hydraulic relationships and can be considered to be a single unified phreatic aquifer the underground water level is between 3 20 and 3 60 m the hydraulic conductivity is between 41 83 and 62 65 m d and water inflow at a single well was 214 9 231 5 m3 h at depths between 1 38 and 4 23 m the main sources of water recharging the groundwater are meteoric precipitation lateral infiltration from the songhua river and lateral runoff caused by extraction water is lost from the aquifer partly through evaporation because the aquifer starts near the surface groundwater runoff is quite weak under natural conditions and the hydraulic gradient is 1 3 the hydraulic connection between songhua river and groundwater was close and the variations of water level 2015 2017 were shown in fig 1 d the inter annual variation of groundwater level was consistent with that of songhua river with obvious periodicity and annual variation of about 1 m from july to september the water level of the songhua river was slightly higher than the groundwater level and river water supplied groundwater in other months groundwater supplied songhua river 2 1 2 water quality before water extraction statistical analysis was made on the songhua river and ambient groundwater quality in 2016 before water extraction and the results were shown in table 1 the standards for drinking water quality of china gb 5749 2006 was used as the reference standard the quality of songhua river met the requirements except for turbidity and fe and nh4 exceeded the standard in the dry season the maximum fe and mn concentrations in ambient groundwater were 38 and 19 times respectively above the standard which was mainly due to large amounts of iron and manganese minerals in the aquifer 2 1 3 test well layout and operating conditions the physical chemical and biological gradients were assessed including spatiotemporal distributions in redox conditions during rbf by songhua river three test wells labeled a b and c were established at 20 m intervals along the control section fig 1c the opening of each well was 1000 mm in diameter and the diameter of each well was 529 mm each well was 50 m deep and a 45 m long filter pipe was installed under the solid pipe as can be seen in fig 1 b groundwater and soil samples were collected for analysis from each well throughout the test period a group well pumping each well at a rate of 400 m3 h was used so that the test process was similar to a real water extraction situation the maximum design decrease in depth was 1 3 of the aquifer thickness i e 12 14 m 2 2 sampling procedures river water samples groundwater samples and soil samples were collected to characterize the redox conditions of rbf system a sampling point 50 cm deep at the center of the songhua river was established and the river water sample was collected once each month throughout the 12 month study i e 12 samples were collected triplicate samples were taken at each sampling points and sent to laboratory after being sealed underwater so as to obtain variations of river water quality during the whole hydrological year a total of 23 soil samples were collected from well a b and c during the drilling process of well construction the distribution of soil samples was shown in fig 1 c five samples were taken at 1 m intervals in the fluctuation zone of each well i e at depths of 1 5 m eight samples were collected at unequal intervals between 5 and 50 m deep according to the aquifer characteristics collect soil samples from the core at the specific depth each soil sample was about 20 0 g and triplicate samples were collected at each sampling point the samples were homogenized and stored in a sterilized self sealing bag the soil samples were transported to the laboratory in a cool box with built in ice packs roots animal residues small stones and other foreign bodies were removed from each sample then the samples were stored at 80 c in a freezer until it was analyzed groundwater samples were collected from three wells a b and c in the wet season july and dry season march and 46 samples were collected in total the distribution of groundwater sampling points was consistent with the soil samples as shown in fig 1 c the solinst 425 groundwater depth determination sampler solinst loveland canada was used to collect groundwater samples the sampler was pressurized with a high pressure hand pimp before it was placed in the well and the pressure was released when the sampler reached the specified depth water from the sampling area at the specified depth was directly injected into the sampler a water sample was then placed in a 1 5 l brown polyethylene bottle acidified with h2so4 and stored in a cold storage facility above groundwater level the soil solution sampler sw jilin china was used to collect soil water the sufficient amount of sealed soil water could be obtained in a few hours by pre negative pressure suction mode and 31 mm ceramic head 2 3 analysis of physiochemical parameters of river water and groundwater hydrochemical properties of both river water and groundwater samples were determined the selected analytes and indicators were

spectrophotometry and the detection scope was 0 08 4 0 mg l no3 has strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectral region of 220 nm and another measurement was made at 275 nm to eliminate the influence of dissolved organic matter so4 2 was also determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry the detection scope was 0 1 10 mg l and the ultraviolet spectral wavelength was in the range of 352 354 nm the no3 nh4 and so4 2 concentrations were determined using a lambda 35 spectrophotometer perkin elmer waltham ma usa the total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a combustion oxidation non dispersive infrared absorption method the analytical methods were all based on the chinese national standard drinking water standard examination method gb t 5750 2 4 analysis of microbial communities microbial community and diversity in soil samples were obtained by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing analysis and these were used as biogeochemical indicators to verify redox zonation dna in a soil sample was extracted using a power soil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa the dna purity was determined by 1 5 agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration was determined using a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers 319f 806r f tcagcctacgggnggcwgcag and r ggactachvgggtatc taatcc polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification and thermal cycling were performed on each sample using a 50 μl reaction mixture yang et al 2014 equal volumes of the loading buffer and pcr products were mixed then electrophoresis was performed using 1 5 agarose gel samples with bright main strips between 400 and 450 bp were used in further tests pruesse et al 2012 the pcr products were mixed at equal density ratios and the pcr product mixture was purified using a genejet gel extraction kit thermo fisher scientific sequencing libraries were generated using a nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs ipswich ma usa which was used following the manufacturer s recommendations and index codes fischer et al 2005 the library quality was assessed using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific and an agilent bioanalyzer 2100 system agilent technologies chu et al 2015 finally the libraries were sequenced using an illumina miseq sequencing platform illumina san diego ca usa and 250 bp 300 bp paired end reads were generated the effective sequences were arranged into operational taxonomic units at a 97 sequence identity using the qiime 1 8 software package representative sequences for each operational taxonomic unit were used to annotate the taxonomic information for each sequence using the greengene database using the rdp classifier using a confidence threshold of 70 caporaso et al 2010 abundance based coverage estimators including the alpha diversity species richness estimator for chao1 the shannon diversity index the simpson index and the diversity coverage were calculated for each sample using mothur software rich and myrold et al 2004 2 5 methods of estimating travel time and water mixing we simplified the calculation to get the average travel time based on the assumption that the aquifer was completely penetrated by the river and we ignored the impact of intensive runoff zones on water entrance velocity because the velocity near rbf meters to hundreds of meters per hour was much larger than that at the edge of the cone of depression of groundwater level millimeters to decimeters per hour finally the travel time could be estimated by dividing the darcy based velocity by the distance measured from the river to the wells as equation 1 1 t x v v k rb h rw h pw x where t was the travel time from river water to the wells d x was the distance from the river to the wells m v was the average flow velocity m d k rb was the hydraulic conductivity m d and h rw and h pw were the hydraulic head of river water and groundwater respectively m the parameters used to estimate the travel time from river to the wells was determined by field pimping test and can be seen in table 2 zhu et al 2015 the cl a conservative component of groundwater was then selected as tracer to identify the recharge proportion of songhua river to groundwater the calculation was based on mass balance equation as shown in equation 2 2 p 1 c pw c gw c rw c gw 100 p 2 c rw c pw c rw c gw 100 p 1 p 2 1 where p r was the proportion of songhua river water in the well p w was the proportion of groundwater in the well c pw was the concentration of cl in the pumping well after water level was stabilized mg l c rw and c gw was the concentrations of cl in river water groundwater respectively mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 stabilization process of rbf under water extraction in rbf the redox conditions along the seepage path would constantly change by reasons of the different physical chemical and biological properties of river water and groundwater in the present study water was pumped from well a b and c at constant flow of 400 m3 h and the drawdown of groundwater in the wells under water extraction can be seen in fig 2 a the initial groundwater hydraulic head in well a b and c was 114 52 m 114 86 m and 115 21 m respectively the drawdown of groundwater level in well a b and c all reached specific depth within 1 d fluctuated during 3 7 d and finally returned stability after 7 d this was relatively consistent with the results calculated by equation 1 that the travel time of river water from songhua river to well a b and c was 0 7 d 2 9 d and 7 2 d respectively under water extraction the travel time would be 7 9 d 49 7 d and 168 4 d respectively without water extraction the recharge proportion of river water calculated by equation 2 was shown in fig 2 b and the proportion of river water in well a b and c was 58 42 and 60 respectively river water would reach three pumping wells within 7 2 d however it would take more time for water quality and redox conditions to reach stability in the filtration zone fe2 mn2 and nh4 as indices of the redox environment are generally present in local ambient groundwater and their contents will be changed markedly by rbf spatiotemporal changes in the orp and fe2 mn2 and nh4 contents under the rbf conditions fig 2 could give a clear indication of overall changes in redox conditions and the pump was turned at the very beginning 0 h orp could indicate the equilibrium between all oxidized and reduced species in solution because it is related to the activities of the electroactive species present through the nernst equation kumar and riyazuddin 2012 it can be seen from fig 2 c that the orp of the raw groundwater was low mean 51 20 mv which indicated reducing conditions groundwater extraction strongly increased the orp within 1 d and rapidly changed the conditions from reducing to weakly oxidizing mean orp 151 20 mv the mean orps for the three wells showed that the orp decreased as seepage occurred and the orp started to fluctuate earlier closer to the river than further from the river indicating the recharge process by river water the orp fluctuated mainly because of the fluctuation in do content which would be caused by supplied river water and groundwater fluctuations it can be seen from fig 2 d that fe2 concentrations in all three test wells were similar and low it fluctuated between 1 79 and 9 70 mg l in the first 21 d stabilized at 5 0 5 5 mg l between 22 and 30 d and reduced by 48 51 and 54 respectively in well a b and c variations in mn2 concentration are shown in fig 2 e mn2 fluctuated between 0 79 and 1 26 mg l in the first 21 d stabilized at 0 86 1 03 mg l between 22 and 30 d and reduced by 31 36 and 41 respectively in well a b and c dilution adsorption by the aquifer medium and biotransformation by microorganisms will all have contributed to the changes in the fe2 and mn2 concentrations yakushev et al 2009 burdige and komada 2020 nh4 concentrations in all three test wells decreased slightly as shown in fig 2 f it fluctuated between 0 81 and 1 46 mg l in the first 21 d stabilized at 1 01 1 06 mg l between 22 and 30 d and reduced by 23 18 and 22 respectively in well a b and c in summary the redox indices fe2 mn2 and nh4 all gradually stabilized during 21 d of continuous pumping with decrease of 51 36 and 21 respectively this indicated that the redox conditions in the filtration zone were stable after certain period of groundwater extraction and the rbf showed excellent efficiency in the removal of high fe2 and mn2 concentrations in local ambient groundwater 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of the redox conditions 3 2 1 horizontal distributions and seasonal effects continuous water extraction caused increasing contact between the groundwater and the air in the fluctuation zone 0 5 m deep so the groundwater samples deeper than 5 m were used to represent the inter annual distributions for the redox indices in horizontal infiltration direction as shown in the boxplot in fig 3 a1 3 g1 seasonality was the non negligible factor controlling the annual redox conditions so redox indices for groundwater from 5 m deep were plotted for the wet season july and dry season march to investigate seasonality in redox zonation and the line chart of the effects for seasonality can be seen in fig 3 a2 3 g2 1 do no3 toc and orp as can be seen from fig 3 a1 3 d1 do no3 and toc have similar distribution characteristics in horizontal seepage path do no3 and toc concentrations were high in river water 11 93 mg l 1 86 mg l and 82 18 mg l respectively and dropped sharply 0 81 mg l 0 06 mg l 6 29 mg l respectively within a very short distance 20 m after entering underground environment and remained almost the same from well a to well c in the seepage zone orp also decreased from 144 85 mv to 67 96 mv indicating that the seepage area changed from being an oxidizing environment to a weakly reducing environment do concentration was relatively high in river water because river water level fluctuated greatly and a large surface area of the river was in contact with the air no3 concentration was relatively high in river water because human activities domestic sewage discharge fertilizer applications more readily affect river water organic carbon in river water and groundwater would have been the main electron donor for redox reactions in the water and the main source of carbon for microbial growth and activity in the filtration zone toc concentration was relatively high in river water and dropped substantially in well a under oxic conditions during the first meters of filtration zone to aquifer the suspended organic carbon was removed through absorption and 20 50 of dissolved organic carbon was readily degraded sprenger et al 2011 servais et al 1989 furthermore toc concentration in groundwater showed upward trend and toc in well c was relative higher than that in well a b this was because toc require long retention times for degradation under anoxic or anaerobic conditions dissolution and desorption processes led to the increase of toc concentration abdelrady et al 2020a abdelrady et al 2020b grünheid et al 2005 the reaction equations of the microbial respiration the organic matter degradation and the denitrification related to do no3 and toc are specified in section 3 3 do no3 and toc concentrations in river water were markedly different in the wet and dry seasons it can be seen from fig 3 a2 3 d2 that do no3 and toc concentrations in river water were 12 23 2 13 and 98 14 mg l respectively in the wet season and 9 43 1 73 and 72 06 mg l respectively in the dry season this mainly because the river temperature and microbial activity intensity were higher in the wet season than the dry season and more o2 organic carbon and no3 were consumed in the wet season it is worth noting that the seasonal differences in do no3 and toc concentrations in groundwater were lower than those in river water this indicates the advantages of rbf 2 fe2 and mn2 fe2 and mn2 participated as electron carriers in redox reactions mediated by microorganisms boxplots of fe2 and mn2 concentrations along the filtration path are shown in fig 3 e1 and 3 f1 the most important conclusion drawn from the plots was that fe2 and mn2 concentrations were low in river water but extremely high in groundwater the soil in the study region contains large amounts of iron and manganese minerals feco3 mnco3 fe2o3 mno2 and leaching in the initial infiltration stage would have caused various biogeochemical processes including oxidation precipitation reductive dissolution microbial transformation et al the redox conditions acid base conditions and microbial community structure along the filtration path have significant effect on these biogeochemical processes related reaction equations are specified in section 3 3 unlike seasonal effects on do no3 toc fe2 and mn2 concentrations in river water were low and only slightly varied seasonally in fig 3 e2 and 3 f2 however fe2 and mn2 concentrations in groundwater were markedly 30 higher in the dry season than the wet season which was clearly a seasonal effect this would have been caused by the hydraulic gradient between the river and groundwater being small and the contact time between the water and rock being long in the dry season meaning more fe2 and mn2 reduction and dissolution occurred in the groundwater in the dry season than the wet season 3 so4 2 so4 2 which is an electron acceptor would have participated in reactions involving microorganisms a boxplot of so4 2 concentration along the filtration path is shown in fig 3 g1 so4 2 concentration was high in river water but was markedly low in groundwater reduced by 32 3 in well a as can be seen from fig 3 g2 seasonality on so4 2 is also reflected in the change of concentration and so4 2 in well b and well c were clearly lower in the wet season than the dry season however the so4 2 in river water and groundwater in wet season were both lower than that in dry season which is different from the seasonal characteristics of other indices 3 2 2 vertical distributions and seasonal effects the indices values for the complete hydrological year at the same sampling depth in three wells were summed and averaged to give the vertical spatial distributions of redox conditions and seasonality was also taken into account the results shown in fig 4 indicated a good degree of agreement between different indices the variations in redox indices could be divided into three sections with depth ranges of 0 5 5 10 and 10 40 m the 0 5 m section was the fluctuation zone in which the redox indices fluctuated strongly orp do and no3 decreased rapidly from being high at 1 m deep to being relatively low at 5 m deep while the reduction product fe2 and mn2 concentrations increased as depth increased this would largely have been caused by the different compositions and properties of the materials at the different depths the fluctuation zone is a mixed solid liquid gas zone that includes the unsaturated zone the capillary zone and the saturated zone meng et al 2021 this indicated that a transition from oxidizing conditions to weak oxidizing and reducing conditions occurred over a short distance in the 0 5 m deep section where o2 no3 reactions occurred in the section at 5 10 m depth fe2 and mn2 would have participated in redox reactions as electron carriers and caused the decreasing orp fe2 and mn2 concentrations reached the maximum 5 92 mg l 1 40 mg l at 10 m deep and then remained to be relatively stable this was consistent with the results for the horizontal infiltration direction and 5 10 m depth could therefore be treated as fe mn reaction zone do toc fe2 and mn2 were constant from 10 to 40 m deep and so4 2 decreased slightly indicating that so4 2 participated in redox reactions as an electron acceptor deeper that the fe mn reaction zone like variability in horizontal infiltration direction seasonality in the vertical infiltration direction mostly affected changes in concentrations but not the distribution rules do and no3 concentrations were slightly higher in the dry season than the wet season and both decreased strongly in the fluctuation zone 0 5 m deep and remained essentially constant from 5 to 40 m deep fe2 and mn2 were the indices that most clearly had seasonal variations being markedly higher in the dry season than the wet season in groundwater fe2 and mn2 reached the maximum concentrations 10 m deep and then remained constant as the depth increased further reactions involving so4 2 became more likely and the concentration decreased as the increased distance from the riverbank and the increased depth in summary there were strong seasonal effects on the concentrations of the redox indices but weak seasonal effects on redox indices variations and zonation 3 3 redox zonation of filtration zone 3 3 1 selection and threshold for redox zonation indices based on the horizontal and vertical distributions of the redox conditions in section 3 2 redox indices data were normalized for principle component analysis pca to further verify similarities and differences as can be seen in fig 5 the hydrochemical environment of groundwater in the dry season and wet season was similar and both can be divided into three groups along the depth group ⅰ mainly included groundwater samples of 0 3 m group ⅱ mainly included groundwater samples of 3 10 m and group iii mainly included groundwater samples of 10 45 m this was coincide with the spatiotemporal distributions of o2 no3 fe2 mn2 and so4 2 concentrations in section 3 2 and these five indices were selected as the indices for redox zonation based on the spatiotemporal variations of the redox conditions the redox zones were divided using redox indices values o2 no3 fe2 mn2 and so4 2 and gibbs free energies of the reactions taking place according to thermodynamic principles differences in gibbs free energy cause electron acceptors to have different capacities to compete for electrons as organic matter was the dominant electron donor for redox reactions in the study area the electron acceptors would be utilized in the order o2 no3 mn4 fe3 and so4 2 based on the monitoring data of local redox indices and precious studies algeo and li 2020 clague et al 2019 the threshold of redox process was determined as shown in table 3 the redox zones named by the most significant redox process were an o2 no3 reduction zone an fe mn reduction zone and a so4 2 zone 3 3 2 redox process in redox zones 1 o2 no3 reduction zone groundwater could be considered to be an anaerobic environment in which no3 reduction occurred and the concentrations of other reducing substances were relatively low if free o2 concentration was 1 mg l algeo and li 2020 clague et al 2019 o2 in the underground environment however was consumed firstly along the seepage path and no3 reduction occurred within a short distance in the horizontal infiltration direction o2 was almost exhausted 1 mg l at well a and no3 had decreased to below the detection limit 0 08 mg l in the vertical infiltration direction o2 and no3 concentrations decreased and became extremely low as the depth increased from 0 to 5 m the do and no3 consumption zones therefore could be combined to give the o2 no3 reduction zone groundwater changed from being an oxidizing environment to a weakly oxidizing environment in this zone and the main reactions that occurred are shown below ch2o o2 h2o co2 energy n2 5 ch2o 4no3 4h 7h2o 5co2 2 2 fe mn reduction zone along the seepage path river water passed through the o2 no3 reduction zone where co2 was produced groundwater containing co2 at a low ph would have flowed through the aquifer which was rich in carbonate minerals such as rhodochrosite and fe mn minerals in the exchangeable state would have desorbed from the medium and carbonate bound fe mn minerals would have dissolved microorganisms would also have catalyzed reactions that caused fe and mn in organic complexes and reduced or oxidized fe and mn bound to organic matter in the medium to dissolve in the groundwater so the fe2 and mn2 concentrations in the groundwater increased fe2 and mn2 in groundwater varied in similar ways increasing rapidly at first and then decreasing gradually after reaching a maximum the zones in which fe2 and mn2 were reduced could therefore be merged to give the fe mn reduction zone the mn2 concentration reached a maximum at well b in the horizontal infiltration direction and at 10 m deep in the vertical infiltration direction the fe2 concentration reached a maximum at 10 m deep but did not reach a maximum in the horizontal infiltration direction so the boundary of the fe mn reduction zone was determined from changes in the so4 2 concentration the main reactions that occurred in the fe mn reduction zone are shown below 2 mnco3 co2 h2o mn hco3 2 feco3 co2 h2o fe hco3 o2 ch2o 2mno2 s 4h mn2 3h2o c o2 ch2o 4fe oh 3 s 8h 4fe2 11h2o c fe2o3 h2o 2feooh weak acid alkaline conditions fe2o3 3h2s 2fes 3h2o s desulfurization bacteria involved 3 so4 2 reduction zone below the mn fe reduction zone so4 2 acted as an electron acceptor in redox processes mediated by microorganisms in horizontal infiltration direction so4 2 clearly decreased after well b and the so4 2 reduction zone was 40 m from the river bank in vertical infiltration direction so4 2 clearly decreased between 25 and 40 m which was the main so4 2 reduction zone the main reaction that occurred in the so4 2 reduction zone is shown below o2 ch2o so4 2 h hs 2h2o 2c the unified structure of the aquifer and the spatiotemporal distributions of the redox indices led to the redox zones being divided as shown in fig 6 the channel through which the river water recharged the groundwater shown in the figure was assumed and there may be some differences between the assumed and actual situation because of the presence of a dominant recharging channel the intention of the figure is to indicate that when river water infiltrates groundwater the strong infiltration flow will cause substances and the environmental characteristics in the original underground environment to migrate along with the river water this will cause the redox zones to expand over a short distance in the infiltration direction and a complex redox boundary to form 3 4 microbial responses to redox zonation 3 4 1 microbial diversity analysis microorganisms in an aqueous medium obtain nutrients and energy for growth and metabolism from underground environment and a change in redox conditions will to some extent promote changes in microbial community structure and function correspondingly different microbial communities and functions will affect the evolution of the groundwater chemical composition in different ways the microorganisms in the environment will therefore respond in certain ways to redox zonation differences in the microbial community and diversity in the seepage zone were identified using microbial alpha diversity indices as shown in table 4 good s coverage reflected the coverage degree of sequencing data to the microbes in the community each index in table 4 had a coverage 0 9 indicating that the results reflected the microbial community composition and distribution well otus were operational taxonomic units in sequencing analysis and each otu corresponded to a different 16s rrna sequence chao1 was the index for measuring species abundance and predicting microbial species according to the number and relative proportion of otu simpson was the index for indicating the abundance and evenness of species the higher the value of otus chao1 and simpson indices were the better the evenness and diversity of species in the samples the decrease of otus chao1 and simpson indices in table 4 indicated that the microbial community abundance decreased along the horizontal infiltration direction the variations in the abundance based coverage estimators and chao1 were consistent with the variations in the shannon and simpson indices indicating that the microbial community richness was markedly higher in the fluctuation zone than the saturated zone in the vertical infiltration direction unifrac software was used to determine the beta diversity analysis for the samples from the study area and principal coordinates analysis pcoa was used to visualize similarities and differences between the aqueous samples it can be seen from fig 7 that the sampling points could be divided into three groups group i contained sampling points a3 a5 b1 and c1 c3 group ii contained sampling points a1 a2 b2 b4 and c4 the distance between group i and group ii was small indicating that the microbial communities in the fluctuation zone were similar group iii contained sampling points a7 a8 b6 b8 c7 and c8 in the saturated zone the diversity of indigenous microorganisms in the saturated zone correlated to some extent with the hydrodynamic conditions and aquifer structure stegen et al 2016 group iii formed mainly because of the high porosity of the water bearing medium in the saturated zone of the study rbf the close hydraulic connection between the surface water and groundwater the good horizontal continuity of acid base and redox zonation and the high infiltration 3 4 2 core microbial community structure at the genus level the microbial community structure and diversity at the genus level r 0 1 are shown in fig 8 in relative abundance order pseudomonas acinetobacter sphingobium sphingomonas ochrobactrum and escherichia were six dominant bacteria both in the fluctuation zone accounting for 3 52 0 2 32 0 1 11 0 1 11 0 2 11 and 0 1 11 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively and the saturation zone accounting for 1 16 1 9 0 1 13 0 1 11 0 2 9 and 0 1 5 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively these genera however were found at much higher relative abundances in the fluctuation zone than the saturated zone the dominant bacteria genera endemic to the fluctuation zone were candidatus solibacter streptomyces da101 and streptococcus accounting for 3 32 0 06 34 0 1 35 and 0 02 4 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively the dominant bacteria genera endemic to the saturation zone were flavobacterium perlucidibaca limnobacter aeromonas alishewanella comamonas cellvibrio and hydrogenophaga accounting for 0 6 59 0 5 25 0 1 8 0 1 2 0 1 7 0 1 4 0 1 4 and 0 1 2 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively which were all typical anaerobic and facultative anaerobes pseudomonas one of the six dominant bacteria genera is a denitrifying genus that can convert nitrate in water to n2o n2 and other insoluble gases the denitrification activity of pseudomonas is strongly affected by the do concentration mckee et al 2016 pseudomonas also plays an important role in the biotransformation of fe mn participate in al ca cation exchange between iron and phosphate and efficiently degrade pahs mckee et al 2016 acinetobacter vanbroekhoven et al 2004 and ochrobactrum are typical fe mn oxidizing bacteria that had high relative abundances and both play crucial roles in the conversion of fe mn and nh3 n in groundwater flavobacterium species which were found in the saturated zone are typical manganese oxidizing bacteria that are commonly found in manganese deposits tekerlekopoulou et al 2008 hydrogenophaga species belong to the β proteobacteria class and are typical iron reducing bacteria that reduce iron bearing minerals and chemically convert manganese into various manganese oxides oppong anane et al 2018 3 4 3 redundancy analysis redundancy analysis rda is a multivariate direct gradient method that combines multivariate regression and correspondence analysis the species data top 14 microbial genera with highest relative abundance and the environmental parameter variations were subjected to rda using canoco version 5 0 software interactive forward selection analysis was firstly used to search for redox indices strongly correlated with microbial variability the relationships between core microbial community data at the genus level and redox indices were then quantitatively described by means of the constrained species environmental variables analysis the results are shown in fig 9 the contributions of different redox indices to the core microbial community data at the genus level are shown in table 5 correlations between the microbial community data and redox indices in the fluctuation zone are shown in fig 9 a the x axis explained 59 20 of the variability and the microbial community data positively correlated with do nh4 no3 so4 2 toc concentrations and orp value the y axis explained a further 39 53 of the variability and the microbial community data positively correlated with fe2 mn2 and nh4 concentrations it can be seen from table 5 that the do mn2 fe2 played the key role in controlling the microbial community in the fluctuation zone explaining 21 1 p 0 020 18 5 p 0 024 and 14 5 p 0 076 respectively of the microbial variability this was consistent with the division of the o2 no3 reduction zone and fe mn reduction zone in the fluctuation zone however the redox indices showed relatively low explanatory degree for microbial variability because the fluctuation zone was an active biogeochemical reaction zone in which the microbial species were abundant the microbes were actively growing and metabolizing zhou et al 2015 the biogeochemical activity in the fluctuation zone was high and controlled by complex physical and chemical gradients rather than single redox indices correlations between the microbial community data and redox indices in the saturated zone are shown in fig 9 b the x axis explained 99 92 of the variability and the microbial community data positively correlated with fe2 mn2 concentrations and orp value negatively correlated with do so4 2 toc and nh4 concentrations no3 was screened by interactive forward selection analysis and was not considered to be associated with microbial variability in the saturated zone it can be seen from table 5 that fe2 and mn2 concentrations explained 26 2 p 0 046 and 27 7 p 0 056 of the microbial variability in the saturated zone so4 2 however explained only 3 6 of the microbial variability the effect of fe2 and mn2 concentrations on biogeochemical activity was far more than so4 2 even if the rbf system has reduced fe2 and mn2 concentrations to certain extent this was not conflict with the division of so4 2 reduction zone because high fe2 and mn2 concentrations were present in local ambient groundwater but so4 2 was involved in redox reactions in so4 2 reduction zone we believe this was the microbial variability characteristic of rbf with high fe2 and mn2 concentrations the results of pca pcoa rda and microbial community structure and diversity at the genus level showed that the core microorganism compositions in different redox zones fig 10 were rather different this indicated that variations in the redox environment and background soil parameters could cause spatial differences in the microbial community structure and diversity 4 conclusions under rbf system with high fe2 and mn2 contents detailed redox zonation mapping of geology water quality and microorganism was constructed orp do fe2 mn2 no3 so4 2 and toc concentrations were used as redox indices to investigate spatiotemporal variations in the redox conditions and to identify the redox zones in the filtration zone biogeochemical indices microbial community and diversity data were used to verify the redox zonation results the conclusions are given below 1 rbf system worked effectively and redox conditions gradually stabilized over 21 d of water extraction fe2 mn2 and nh4 concentrations had decreased and become stable at 5 00 5 60 0 86 1 03 and 1 00 1 06 mg l respectively which were about half lower than the initial concentrations 2 moving in horizontal and vertical infiltration direction do 1 mg l no3 close to the detection limit and toc which decreased by 91 concentrations were markedly lower at well a and at 5 m deep which was an o2 no3 reduction zone mn2 reached a maximum concentration at well b and at 10 m deep while fe2 concentration increase to be stable which was an fe mn reduction zone so4 2 concentration was markedly lower at well c and at the depth increased from 10 m which was a so4 2 reduction zone 3 seasonality in the redox environment was mainly reflected in concentrations of the redox indices rather than the spatial variations and redox zone ranges seasonality results in a 30 fluctuation of fe2 and mn2 contents in redox zones and markedly fluctuation of do toc nh4 and so4 2 contents in river water 4 the microbial community structure and diversity data confirmed the redox zonation results indicated by the redox indices mn2 and fe2 explained most of the microbial variability both in the fluctuation zone 18 5 and 14 5 and the saturated zone 27 7 and 26 2 pseudomonas flavobacterium and limnobacter were the dominant bacteria in the o2 no3 fe mn and so4 2 reduction zones respectively this research has obtained and exhibited the redox conditions of rbf system with high fe2 and mn2 contents which was of great value for water supply along the songhua river in northeast china more critically a systematic method was proposed to study redox conditions in rbf from multiple perspectives of hydrogeology hydrochemistry and microbiology especially in the areas with primary pollution feature redox indices and microbial responses are non

3426,the redox conditions strongly affect redox kinetics hydrochemical composition and microbial reactions under river bank filtration rbf for investigating the redox conditions zonation factors and microbial responses in a typical rbf with high fe2 and mn2 contents three wells were established 20 m apart perpendicular to the south bank of the songhua river with a constant flow rate of 400 m3 h redox zonation was identified from the redox sequences redox products reactions identified and seasonality high throughput sequencing principal coordinates analysis and redundancy analysis were used to identify the microbial responses to redox zonation the results indicated that the rbf was stabilized after 21 d of water extraction with a 51 36 and 21 decrease of fe2 mn2 and nh4 contents respectively feature redox indices varied with strong regularity in the horizontal and vertical filtration directions and the filtration area could be divided into o2 no3 fe mn and so4 2 reduction zones seasonality resulted in markedly fluctuation of fe2 and mn2 contents in groundwater pseudomonas flavobacterium and limnobacter were the dominant bacteria in the o2 no3 fe mn and so4 2 reduction zones respectively do explained 21 1 of microbial variability in the fluctuation zone while mn2 and fe2 explained 27 7 and 26 2 respectively of microbial variability in the saturated zone keywords river bank filtration groundwater redox conditions and zonation seasonality microbial responses 1 introduction river bank filtration rbf is used around the world to sustainably produce drinking water hiscock and grischek 2002 eckert and irmscher 2006 zhu et al 2020 surface groundwater interactions are important to river bank filtration system vogt et al 2010 gillefalk et al 2019 gutiérrez et al 2018 kuehn and mueller 2000 goldschneider et al 2007 however surface water and groundwater have different physical chemical and biological properties this causes a series of redox reactions and the degradation of organic matter henzler et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2016a and clear redox zonation therefore forms in the filtration zone postma and jakobsen 1996 massmann et al 2004 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 burke et al 2014 it has been found that the redox conditions in the filtration zone strongly affect water quality components kazak and pozdniakov 2021 abdelrady et al 2020a the redox kinetics schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 oberleitner et al 2020 singh et al 2010 bertelkamp et al 2016b and the removal efficiencies of many trace organic compounds burke et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2014 abdelrady et al 2019 the redox conditions however is commonly described with oxidation reduction potential orp or electrical potential eh in present studies henzler et al 2016 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 describing redox conditions with single index is flexible but easily misjudged and more factors controlling redox conditions needed to be taken into account the redox conditions in the filtration zone largely depend on the ambient groundwater quality sahu et al 2019 and certain groundwater components could indicate certain redox conditions farnsworth and hering 2011 abdelrady et al 2020a abdelrady et al 2020b lee et al 2020 o connor et al 2015 for example fe2 is relatively widely found in groundwater because groundwater is usually a reducing environment dissolution of manganese minerals however is strongly affected by the acidity and mn2 has a low ph threshold so the fe reduction zone is usually wider than the mn reduction zone matsunaga et al 1993 snyder et al 2004 changes in the aquifer structure and mineral composition temperature and hydrodynamic conditions of the infiltration path can also cause redox zonation sanz prat et al 2020 yakushev et al 2009 munz et al 2019 found that the degradation rates of several organic micropollutants during rbf were mostly controlled by the redox conditions and temperature and that the temperature markedly affected the ranges of the most reactive oxidation zones wang et al 2020 found that differences in hydrodynamic conditions caused differences in riverbed sediment lithology in the liaohe river and therefore affected redox reactions during rbf different redox conditions therefore can be identified by variations in relative geological characteristics microbial activity is another non negligible factor that affects redox zonation microorganisms successively consume dissolved oxygen do no3 fe3 so4 2 and co2 in groundwater to generate reducing substances such as no2 fe2 and hs during the rbf evolution process bai et al 2020 bethke et al 2008 komlos et al 2008 this causes redox gradients and changes the microorganism community structure and diversity in the filtration zone griebler and avramov 2015 mansour et al 2018 causing certain bacterial genera to become dominant by causing some degree of microorganism selection hoffmann and gunkel 2011 fillinger et al 2021 bertelkamp et al 2016c langenheder and lindström 2019 different redox conditions therefore can be assessed by measuring certain hydrochemical geochemical and biogeochemical indicators as mentioned above some scholars have defined redox zonation more scientifically using such indices lyngkilde and christensen 1992 established zonation thresholds using thermodynamic principles and identified various redox zones in the vejen landfill in denmark zhang et al 2021 established a quantitative redox zonation model suitable for hydrocarbon contaminated aquifers and extended it to other aquifers in which similar microbial mechanisms occur a systematic method therefore is expected to be proposed from multiple indicators charactering redox conditions and defining redox zonation more intuitively and scientifically the main objective of the manuscript was to study redox conditions redox zonation and microbial responses during rbf process with high contents of fe2 and mn2 the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of redox conditions during the complete hydrological year were quantified by using hydrochemical indicator in river water and groundwater redox zonation were then divided by combining seasonality the sequence products of redox reactions and the threshold of redox indices the microbial community and diversity data in soils were used as biogeochemical indicator to verify redox zonation this work helps to control the redox conditions of songhua river and provide a systematic method for rbf redox analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location and hydrogeological conditions the study area is in the northwestern part of harbin city in northeastern china fig 1 a the annual average temperature at the study area is 3 5 c the annual average rainfall is 505 4 mm and annual evaporation is 1411 19 mm the study area is on the songhua river floodplain and songhua river flows through the study area from southwest to northeast the river has a water surface width of 200 400 m and water depth of 1 4 7 m the average annual maximum water level is 116 80 m above sea level the average annual water level fluctuates between 115 23 and 116 80 m a variation of 1 57 m with a long term average of 115 86 m the average annual run off of the river is 33 3 109 m3 with an average run off depth of 85 5 mm the groundwater is mainly in a quaternary porous phreatic aquifer 40 50 m thick fig 1b the top of the aquifer is a discontinuous layer of fine yellow sand at a depth of between 1 and 3 m with well sorted and poor roundness a grayish yellow and grayish white gravel layer at 3 11 m deep is sandwiched between a thin silty clay layer and a lens layer a continuous sand and gravel layer that is poorly sorted and contains subangular particles is at 12 42 m deep black and gray silty clays alternate with gravel and coarse sand between 43 and 50 m deep gray green bedrock with an argillaceous structure and no fractures is below 50 m there are discontinuous silty clay layers within each layer the layers have close hydraulic relationships and can be considered to be a single unified phreatic aquifer the underground water level is between 3 20 and 3 60 m the hydraulic conductivity is between 41 83 and 62 65 m d and water inflow at a single well was 214 9 231 5 m3 h at depths between 1 38 and 4 23 m the main sources of water recharging the groundwater are meteoric precipitation lateral infiltration from the songhua river and lateral runoff caused by extraction water is lost from the aquifer partly through evaporation because the aquifer starts near the surface groundwater runoff is quite weak under natural conditions and the hydraulic gradient is 1 3 the hydraulic connection between songhua river and groundwater was close and the variations of water level 2015 2017 were shown in fig 1 d the inter annual variation of groundwater level was consistent with that of songhua river with obvious periodicity and annual variation of about 1 m from july to september the water level of the songhua river was slightly higher than the groundwater level and river water supplied groundwater in other months groundwater supplied songhua river 2 1 2 water quality before water extraction statistical analysis was made on the songhua river and ambient groundwater quality in 2016 before water extraction and the results were shown in table 1 the standards for drinking water quality of china gb 5749 2006 was used as the reference standard the quality of songhua river met the requirements except for turbidity and fe and nh4 exceeded the standard in the dry season the maximum fe and mn concentrations in ambient groundwater were 38 and 19 times respectively above the standard which was mainly due to large amounts of iron and manganese minerals in the aquifer 2 1 3 test well layout and operating conditions the physical chemical and biological gradients were assessed including spatiotemporal distributions in redox conditions during rbf by songhua river three test wells labeled a b and c were established at 20 m intervals along the control section fig 1c the opening of each well was 1000 mm in diameter and the diameter of each well was 529 mm each well was 50 m deep and a 45 m long filter pipe was installed under the solid pipe as can be seen in fig 1 b groundwater and soil samples were collected for analysis from each well throughout the test period a group well pumping each well at a rate of 400 m3 h was used so that the test process was similar to a real water extraction situation the maximum design decrease in depth was 1 3 of the aquifer thickness i e 12 14 m 2 2 sampling procedures river water samples groundwater samples and soil samples were collected to characterize the redox conditions of rbf system a sampling point 50 cm deep at the center of the songhua river was established and the river water sample was collected once each month throughout the 12 month study i e 12 samples were collected triplicate samples were taken at each sampling points and sent to laboratory after being sealed underwater so as to obtain variations of river water quality during the whole hydrological year a total of 23 soil samples were collected from well a b and c during the drilling process of well construction the distribution of soil samples was shown in fig 1 c five samples were taken at 1 m intervals in the fluctuation zone of each well i e at depths of 1 5 m eight samples were collected at unequal intervals between 5 and 50 m deep according to the aquifer characteristics collect soil samples from the core at the specific depth each soil sample was about 20 0 g and triplicate samples were collected at each sampling point the samples were homogenized and stored in a sterilized self sealing bag the soil samples were transported to the laboratory in a cool box with built in ice packs roots animal residues small stones and other foreign bodies were removed from each sample then the samples were stored at 80 c in a freezer until it was analyzed groundwater samples were collected from three wells a b and c in the wet season july and dry season march and 46 samples were collected in total the distribution of groundwater sampling points was consistent with the soil samples as shown in fig 1 c the solinst 425 groundwater depth determination sampler solinst loveland canada was used to collect groundwater samples the sampler was pressurized with a high pressure hand pimp before it was placed in the well and the pressure was released when the sampler reached the specified depth water from the sampling area at the specified depth was directly injected into the sampler a water sample was then placed in a 1 5 l brown polyethylene bottle acidified with h2so4 and stored in a cold storage facility above groundwater level the soil solution sampler sw jilin china was used to collect soil water the sufficient amount of sealed soil water could be obtained in a few hours by pre negative pressure suction mode and 31 mm ceramic head

using an illumina miseq sequencing platform illumina san diego ca usa and 250 bp 300 bp paired end reads were generated the effective sequences were arranged into operational taxonomic units at a 97 sequence identity using the qiime 1 8 software package representative sequences for each operational taxonomic unit were used to annotate the taxonomic information for each sequence using the greengene database using the rdp classifier using a confidence threshold of 70 caporaso et al 2010 abundance based coverage estimators including the alpha diversity species richness estimator for chao1 the shannon diversity index the simpson index and the diversity coverage were calculated for each sample using mothur software rich and myrold et al 2004 2 5 methods of estimating travel time and water mixing we simplified the calculation to get the average travel time based on the assumption that the aquifer was completely penetrated by the river and we ignored the impact of intensive runoff zones on water entrance velocity because the velocity near rbf meters to hundreds of meters per hour was much larger than that at the edge of the cone of depression of groundwater level millimeters to decimeters per hour finally the travel time could be estimated by dividing the darcy based velocity by the distance measured from the river to the wells as equation 1 1 t x v v k rb h rw h pw x where t was the travel time from river water to the wells d x was the distance from the river to the wells m v was the average flow velocity m d k rb was the hydraulic conductivity m d and h rw and h pw were the hydraulic head of river water and groundwater respectively m the parameters used to estimate the travel time from river to the wells was determined by field pimping test and can be seen in table 2 zhu et al 2015 the cl a conservative component of groundwater was then selected as tracer to identify the recharge proportion of songhua river to groundwater the calculation was based on mass balance equation as shown in equation 2 2 p 1 c pw c gw c rw c gw 100 p 2 c rw c pw c rw c gw 100 p 1 p 2 1 where p r was the proportion of songhua river water in the well p w was the proportion of groundwater in the well c pw was the concentration of cl in the pumping well after water level was stabilized mg l c rw and c gw was the concentrations of cl in river water groundwater respectively mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 stabilization process of rbf under water extraction in rbf the redox conditions along the seepage path would constantly change by reasons of the different physical chemical and biological properties of river water and groundwater in the present study water was pumped from well a b and c at constant flow of 400 m3 h and the drawdown of groundwater in the wells under water extraction can be seen in fig 2 a the initial groundwater hydraulic head in well a b and c was 114 52 m 114 86 m and 115 21 m respectively the drawdown of groundwater level in well a b and c all reached specific depth within 1 d fluctuated during 3 7 d and finally returned stability after 7 d this was relatively consistent with the results calculated by equation 1 that the travel time of river water from songhua river to well a b and c was 0 7 d 2 9 d and 7 2 d respectively under water extraction the travel time would be 7 9 d 49 7 d and 168 4 d respectively without water extraction the recharge proportion of river water calculated by equation 2 was shown in fig 2 b and the proportion of river water in well a b and c was 58 42 and 60 respectively river water would reach three pumping wells within 7 2 d however it would take more time for water quality and redox conditions to reach stability in the filtration zone fe2 mn2 and nh4 as indices of the redox environment are generally present in local ambient groundwater and their contents will be changed markedly by rbf spatiotemporal changes in the orp and fe2 mn2 and nh4 contents under the rbf conditions fig 2 could give a clear indication of overall changes in redox conditions and the pump was turned at the very beginning 0 h orp could indicate the equilibrium between all oxidized and reduced species in solution because it is related to the activities of the electroactive species present through the nernst equation kumar and riyazuddin 2012 it can be seen from fig 2 c that the orp of the raw groundwater was low mean 51 20 mv which indicated reducing conditions groundwater extraction strongly increased the orp within 1 d and rapidly changed the conditions from reducing to weakly oxidizing mean orp 151 20 mv the mean orps for the three wells showed that the orp decreased as seepage occurred and the orp started to fluctuate earlier closer to the river than further from the river indicating the recharge process by river water the orp fluctuated mainly because of the fluctuation in do content which would be caused by supplied river water and groundwater fluctuations it can be seen from fig 2 d that fe2 concentrations in all three test wells were similar and low it fluctuated between 1 79 and 9 70 mg l in the first 21 d stabilized at 5 0 5 5 mg l between 22 and 30 d and reduced by 48 51 and 54 respectively in well a b and c variations in mn2 concentration are shown in fig 2 e mn2 fluctuated between 0 79 and 1 26 mg l in the first 21 d stabilized at 0 86 1 03 mg l between 22 and 30 d and reduced by 31 36 and 41 respectively in well a b and c dilution adsorption by the aquifer medium and biotransformation by microorganisms will all have contributed to the changes in the fe2 and mn2 concentrations yakushev et al 2009 burdige and komada 2020 nh4 concentrations in all three test wells decreased slightly as shown in fig 2 f it fluctuated between 0 81 and 1 46 mg l in the first 21 d stabilized at 1 01 1 06 mg l between 22 and 30 d and reduced by 23 18 and 22 respectively in well a b and c in summary the redox indices fe2 mn2 and nh4 all gradually stabilized during 21 d of continuous pumping with decrease of 51 36 and 21 respectively this indicated that the redox conditions in the filtration zone were stable after certain period of groundwater extraction and the rbf showed excellent efficiency in the removal of high fe2 and mn2 concentrations in local ambient groundwater 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of the redox conditions 3 2 1 horizontal distributions and seasonal effects continuous water extraction caused increasing contact between the groundwater and the air in the fluctuation zone 0 5 m deep so the groundwater samples deeper than 5 m were used to represent the inter annual distributions for the redox indices in horizontal infiltration direction as shown in the boxplot in fig 3 a1 3 g1 seasonality was the non negligible factor controlling the annual redox conditions so redox indices for groundwater from 5 m deep were plotted for the wet season july and dry season march to investigate seasonality in redox zonation and the line chart of the effects for seasonality can be seen in fig 3 a2 3 g2 1 do no3 toc and orp as can be seen from fig 3 a1 3 d1 do no3 and toc have similar distribution characteristics in horizontal seepage path do no3 and toc concentrations were high in river water 11 93 mg l 1 86 mg l and 82 18 mg l respectively and dropped sharply 0 81 mg l 0 06 mg l 6 29 mg l respectively within a very short distance 20 m after entering underground environment and remained almost the same from well a to well c in the seepage zone orp also decreased from 144 85 mv to 67 96 mv indicating that the seepage area changed from being an oxidizing environment to a weakly reducing environment do concentration was relatively high in river water because river water level fluctuated greatly and a large surface area of the river was in contact with the air no3 concentration was relatively high in river water because human activities domestic sewage discharge fertilizer applications more readily affect river water organic carbon in river water and groundwater would have been the main electron donor for redox reactions in the water and the main source of carbon for microbial growth and activity in the filtration zone toc concentration was relatively high in river water and dropped substantially in well a under oxic conditions during the first meters of filtration zone to aquifer the suspended organic carbon was removed through absorption and 20 50 of dissolved organic carbon was readily degraded sprenger et al 2011 servais et al 1989 furthermore toc concentration in groundwater showed upward trend and toc in well c was relative higher than that in well a b this was because toc require long retention times for degradation under anoxic or anaerobic conditions dissolution and desorption processes led to the increase of toc concentration abdelrady et al 2020a abdelrady et al 2020b grünheid et al 2005 the reaction equations of the microbial respiration the organic matter degradation and the denitrification related to do no3 and toc are specified in section 3 3 do no3 and toc concentrations in river water were markedly different in the wet and dry seasons it can be seen from fig 3 a2 3 d2 that do no3 and toc concentrations in river water were 12 23 2 13 and 98 14 mg l respectively in the wet season and 9 43 1 73 and 72 06 mg l respectively in the dry season this mainly because the river temperature and microbial activity intensity were higher in the wet season than the dry season and more o2 organic carbon and no3 were consumed in the wet season it is worth noting that the seasonal differences in do no3 and toc concentrations in groundwater were lower than those in river water this indicates the advantages of rbf 2 fe2 and mn2 fe2 and mn2 participated as electron carriers in redox reactions mediated by microorganisms boxplots of fe2 and mn2 concentrations along the filtration path are shown in fig 3 e1 and 3 f1 the most important conclusion drawn from the plots was that fe2 and mn2 concentrations were low in river water but extremely high in groundwater the soil in the study region contains large amounts of iron and manganese minerals feco3 mnco3 fe2o3 mno2 and leaching in the initial infiltration stage would have caused various biogeochemical processes including oxidation precipitation reductive dissolution microbial transformation et al the redox conditions acid base conditions and microbial community structure along the filtration path have significant effect on these biogeochemical processes related reaction equations are specified in section 3 3 unlike seasonal effects on do no3 toc fe2 and mn2 concentrations in river water were low and only slightly varied seasonally in fig 3 e2 and 3 f2 however fe2 and mn2 concentrations in groundwater were markedly 30 higher in the dry season than the wet season which was clearly a seasonal effect this would have been caused by the hydraulic gradient between the river and groundwater being small and the contact time between the water and rock being long in the dry season meaning more fe2 and mn2 reduction and dissolution occurred in the groundwater in the dry season than the wet season 3 so4 2 so4 2 which is an electron acceptor would have participated in reactions involving microorganisms a boxplot of so4 2 concentration along the filtration path is shown in fig 3 g1 so4 2 concentration was high in river water but was markedly low in groundwater reduced by 32 3 in well a as can be seen from fig 3 g2 seasonality on so4 2 is also reflected in the change of concentration and so4 2 in well b and well c were clearly lower in the wet season than the dry season however the so4 2 in river water and groundwater in wet season were both lower than that in dry season which is different from the seasonal characteristics of other indices 3 2 2 vertical distributions and seasonal effects the indices values for the complete hydrological year at the same sampling depth in three wells were summed and averaged to give the vertical spatial distributions of redox conditions and seasonality was also taken into account the results shown in fig 4 indicated a good degree of agreement between different indices the variations in redox indices could be divided into three sections with depth ranges of 0 5 5 10 and 10 40 m the 0 5 m section was the fluctuation zone in which the redox indices fluctuated strongly orp do and no3 decreased rapidly from being high at 1 m deep to being relatively low at 5 m deep while the reduction product fe2 and mn2 concentrations increased as depth increased this would largely have been caused by the different compositions and properties of the materials at the different depths the fluctuation zone is a mixed solid liquid gas zone that includes the unsaturated zone the capillary zone and the saturated zone meng et al 2021 this indicated that a transition from oxidizing conditions to weak oxidizing and reducing conditions occurred over a short distance in the 0 5 m deep section where o2 no3 reactions occurred in the section at 5 10 m depth fe2 and mn2 would have participated in redox reactions as electron carriers and caused the decreasing orp fe2 and mn2 concentrations reached the maximum 5 92 mg l 1 40 mg l at 10 m deep and then remained to be relatively stable this was consistent with the results for the horizontal infiltration direction and 5 10 m depth could therefore be treated as fe mn reaction zone do toc fe2 and mn2 were constant from 10 to 40 m deep and so4 2 decreased slightly indicating that so4 2 participated in redox reactions as an electron acceptor deeper that the fe mn reaction zone like variability in horizontal infiltration direction seasonality in the vertical infiltration direction mostly affected changes in concentrations but not the distribution rules do and no3 concentrations were slightly higher in the dry season than the wet season and both decreased strongly in the fluctuation zone 0 5 m deep and remained essentially constant from 5 to 40 m deep fe2 and mn2 were the indices that most clearly had seasonal variations being markedly higher in the dry season than the wet season in groundwater fe2 and mn2 reached the maximum concentrations 10 m deep and then remained constant as the depth increased further reactions involving so4 2 became more likely and the concentration decreased as the increased distance from the riverbank and the increased depth in summary there were strong seasonal effects on the concentrations of the redox indices but weak seasonal effects on redox indices variations and zonation 3 3 redox zonation of filtration zone 3 3 1 selection and threshold for redox zonation indices based on the horizontal and vertical distributions of the redox conditions in section 3 2 redox indices data were normalized for principle component analysis pca to further verify similarities and differences as can be seen in fig 5 the hydrochemical environment of groundwater in the dry season and wet season was similar and both can be divided into three groups along the depth group ⅰ mainly included groundwater samples of 0 3 m group ⅱ mainly included groundwater samples of 3 10 m and group iii mainly included groundwater samples of 10 45 m this was coincide with the spatiotemporal distributions of o2 no3 fe2 mn2 and so4 2 concentrations in section 3 2 and these five indices were selected as the indices for redox zonation based on the spatiotemporal variations of the redox conditions the redox zones were divided using redox indices values o2 no3 fe2 mn2 and so4 2 and gibbs free energies of the reactions taking place according to thermodynamic principles differences in gibbs free energy cause electron acceptors to have different capacities to compete for electrons as organic matter was the dominant electron donor for redox reactions in the study area the electron acceptors would be utilized in the order o2 no3 mn4 fe3 and so4 2 based on the monitoring data of local redox indices and precious studies algeo and li 2020 clague et al 2019 the threshold of redox process was determined as shown in table 3 the redox zones named by the most significant redox process were an o2 no3 reduction zone an fe mn reduction zone and a so4 2 zone 3 3 2 redox process in redox zones 1 o2 no3 reduction zone groundwater could be considered to be an anaerobic environment in which no3 reduction occurred and the concentrations of other reducing substances were relatively low if free o2 concentration was 1 mg l algeo and li 2020 clague et al 2019 o2 in the underground environment however was consumed firstly along the seepage path and no3 reduction occurred within a short distance in the horizontal infiltration direction o2 was almost exhausted 1 mg l at well a and no3 had decreased to below the detection limit 0 08 mg l in the vertical infiltration direction o2 and no3 concentrations decreased and became extremely low as the depth increased from 0 to 5 m the do and no3 consumption zones therefore could be combined to give the o2 no3 reduction zone groundwater changed from being an oxidizing environment to a weakly oxidizing environment in this zone and the main reactions that occurred are shown below ch2o o2 h2o co2 energy n2 5 ch2o 4no3 4h 7h2o 5co2 2 2 fe mn reduction zone along the seepage path river water passed through the o2 no3 reduction zone where co2 was produced groundwater containing co2 at a low ph would have flowed through the aquifer which was rich in carbonate minerals such as rhodochrosite and fe mn minerals in the exchangeable state would have desorbed from the medium and carbonate bound fe mn minerals would have dissolved microorganisms would also have catalyzed reactions that caused fe and mn in organic complexes and reduced or oxidized fe and mn bound to organic matter in the medium to dissolve in the groundwater so the fe2 and mn2 concentrations in the groundwater increased fe2 and mn2 in groundwater varied in similar ways increasing rapidly at first and then decreasing gradually after reaching a maximum the zones in which fe2 and mn2 were reduced could therefore be merged to give the fe mn reduction zone the mn2 concentration reached a maximum at well b in the horizontal infiltration direction and at 10 m deep in the vertical infiltration direction the fe2 concentration reached a maximum at 10 m deep but did not reach a maximum in the horizontal infiltration direction so the boundary of the fe mn reduction zone was determined from changes in the so4 2 concentration the main reactions that occurred in the fe mn reduction zone are shown below 2 mnco3 co2 h2o mn hco3 2 feco3 co2 h2o fe hco3 o2 ch2o 2mno2 s 4h mn2 3h2o c o2 ch2o 4fe oh 3 s 8h 4fe2 11h2o c fe2o3 h2o 2feooh weak acid alkaline conditions fe2o3 3h2s 2fes 3h2o s desulfurization bacteria involved 3 so4 2 reduction zone below the mn fe reduction zone so4 2 acted as an electron acceptor in redox processes mediated by microorganisms in horizontal infiltration direction so4 2 clearly decreased after well b and the so4 2 reduction zone was 40 m from the river bank in vertical infiltration direction so4 2 clearly decreased between 25 and 40 m which was the main so4 2 reduction zone the main reaction that occurred in the so4 2 reduction zone is shown below o2 ch2o so4 2 h hs 2h2o 2c the unified structure of the aquifer and the spatiotemporal distributions of the redox indices led to the redox zones being divided as shown in fig 6 the channel through which the river water recharged the groundwater shown in the figure was assumed and there may be some differences between the assumed and actual situation because of the presence of a dominant recharging channel the intention of the figure is to indicate that when river water infiltrates groundwater the strong infiltration flow will cause substances and the environmental characteristics in the original underground environment to migrate along with the river water this will cause the redox zones to expand over a short distance in the infiltration direction and a complex redox boundary to form 3 4 microbial responses to redox zonation 3 4 1 microbial diversity analysis microorganisms in an aqueous medium obtain nutrients and energy for growth and metabolism from underground environment and a change in redox conditions will to some extent promote changes in microbial community structure and function correspondingly different microbial communities and functions will affect the evolution of the groundwater chemical composition in different ways the microorganisms in the environment will therefore respond in certain ways to redox zonation differences in the microbial community and diversity in the seepage zone were identified using microbial alpha diversity indices as shown in table 4 good s coverage reflected the coverage degree of sequencing data to the microbes in the community each index in table 4 had a coverage 0 9 indicating that the results reflected the microbial community composition and distribution well otus were operational taxonomic units in sequencing analysis and each otu corresponded to a different 16s rrna sequence chao1 was the index for measuring species abundance and predicting microbial species according to the number and relative proportion of otu simpson was the index for indicating the abundance and evenness of species the higher the value of otus chao1 and simpson indices were the better the evenness and diversity of species in the samples the decrease of otus chao1 and simpson indices in table 4 indicated that the microbial community abundance decreased along the horizontal infiltration direction the variations in the abundance based coverage estimators and chao1 were consistent with the variations in the shannon and simpson indices indicating that the microbial community richness was markedly higher in the fluctuation zone than the saturated zone in the vertical infiltration direction unifrac software was used to determine the beta diversity analysis for the samples from the study area and principal coordinates analysis pcoa was used to visualize similarities and differences between the aqueous samples it can be seen from fig 7 that the sampling points could be divided into three groups group i contained sampling points a3 a5 b1 and c1 c3 group ii contained sampling points a1 a2 b2 b4 and c4 the distance between group i and group ii was small indicating that the microbial communities in the fluctuation zone were similar group iii contained sampling points a7 a8 b6 b8 c7 and c8 in the saturated zone the diversity of indigenous microorganisms in the saturated zone correlated to some extent with the hydrodynamic conditions and aquifer structure stegen et al 2016 group iii formed mainly because of the high porosity of the water bearing medium in the saturated zone of the study rbf the close hydraulic connection between the surface water and groundwater the good horizontal continuity of acid base and redox zonation and the high infiltration 3 4 2 core microbial community structure at the genus level the microbial community structure and diversity at the genus level r 0 1 are shown in fig 8 in relative abundance order pseudomonas acinetobacter sphingobium sphingomonas ochrobactrum and escherichia were six dominant bacteria both in the fluctuation zone accounting for 3 52 0 2 32 0 1 11 0 1 11 0 2 11 and 0 1 11 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively and the saturation zone accounting for 1 16 1 9 0 1 13 0 1 11 0 2 9 and 0 1 5 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively these genera however were found at much higher relative abundances in the fluctuation zone than the saturated zone the dominant bacteria genera endemic to the fluctuation zone were candidatus solibacter streptomyces da101 and streptococcus accounting for 3 32 0 06 34 0 1 35 and 0 02 4 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively the dominant bacteria genera endemic to the saturation zone were flavobacterium perlucidibaca limnobacter aeromonas alishewanella comamonas cellvibrio and hydrogenophaga accounting for 0 6 59 0 5 25 0 1 8 0 1 2 0 1 7 0 1 4 0 1 4 and 0 1 2 of the total cumulative relative abundance respectively which were all typical anaerobic and facultative anaerobes pseudomonas one of the six dominant bacteria genera is a denitrifying genus that can convert nitrate in water to n2o n2 and other insoluble gases the denitrification activity of pseudomonas is strongly affected by the do concentration mckee et al 2016 pseudomonas also plays an important role in the biotransformation of fe mn participate in al ca cation exchange between iron and phosphate and efficiently degrade pahs mckee et al 2016 acinetobacter vanbroekhoven et al 2004 and ochrobactrum are typical fe mn oxidizing bacteria that had high relative abundances and both play crucial roles in the conversion of fe mn and nh3 n in groundwater flavobacterium species which were found in the saturated zone are typical manganese oxidizing bacteria that are commonly found in manganese deposits tekerlekopoulou et al 2008 hydrogenophaga species belong to the β proteobacteria class and are typical iron reducing bacteria that reduce iron bearing minerals and chemically convert manganese into various manganese oxides oppong anane et al 2018 3 4 3 redundancy analysis redundancy analysis rda is a multivariate direct gradient method that combines multivariate regression and correspondence analysis the species data top 14 microbial genera with highest relative abundance and the environmental parameter variations were subjected to rda using canoco version 5 0 software interactive forward selection analysis was firstly used to search for redox indices strongly correlated with microbial variability the relationships between core microbial community data at the genus level and redox indices were then quantitatively described by means of the constrained species environmental variables analysis the results are shown in fig 9 the contributions of different redox indices to the core microbial community data at the genus level are shown in table 5 correlations between the microbial community data and redox indices in the fluctuation zone are shown in fig 9 a the x axis explained 59 20 of the variability and the microbial community data positively correlated with do nh4 no3 so4 2 toc concentrations and orp value the y axis explained a further 39 53 of the variability and the microbial community data positively correlated with fe2 mn2 and nh4 concentrations it can be seen from table 5 that the do mn2 fe2 played the key role in controlling the microbial community in the fluctuation zone explaining 21 1 p 0 020 18 5 p 0 024 and 14 5 p 0 076 respectively of the microbial variability this was consistent with the division of the o2 no3 reduction zone and fe mn reduction zone in the fluctuation zone however the redox indices showed relatively low explanatory degree for microbial variability because the fluctuation zone was an active biogeochemical reaction zone in which the microbial species were abundant the microbes were actively growing and metabolizing zhou et al 2015 the biogeochemical activity in the fluctuation zone was high and controlled by complex physical and chemical gradients rather than single redox indices correlations between the microbial community data and redox indices in the saturated zone are shown in fig 9 b the x axis explained 99 92 of the variability and the microbial community data positively correlated with fe2 mn2 concentrations and orp value negatively correlated with do so4 2 toc and nh4 concentrations no3 was screened by interactive forward selection analysis and was not considered to be associated with microbial variability in the saturated zone it can be seen from table 5 that fe2 and mn2 concentrations explained 26 2 p 0 046 and 27 7 p 0 056 of the microbial variability in the saturated zone so4 2 however explained only 3 6 of the microbial variability the effect of fe2 and mn2 concentrations on biogeochemical activity was far more than so4 2 even if the rbf system has reduced fe2 and mn2 concentrations to certain extent this was not conflict with the division of so4 2 reduction zone because high fe2 and mn2 concentrations were present in local ambient groundwater but so4 2 was involved in redox reactions in so4 2 reduction zone we believe this was the microbial variability characteristic of rbf with high fe2 and mn2 concentrations the results of pca pcoa rda and microbial community structure and diversity at the genus level showed that the core microorganism compositions in different redox zones fig 10 were rather different this indicated that variations in the redox environment and background soil parameters could cause spatial differences in the microbial community structure and diversity 4 conclusions under rbf system with high fe2 and mn2 contents detailed redox zonation mapping of geology water quality and microorganism was constructed orp do fe2 mn2 no3 so4 2 and toc concentrations were used as redox indices to investigate spatiotemporal variations in the redox conditions and to identify the redox zones in the filtration zone biogeochemical indices microbial community and diversity data were used to verify the redox zonation results the conclusions are given below 1 rbf system worked effectively and redox conditions gradually stabilized over 21 d of water extraction fe2 mn2 and nh4 concentrations had decreased and become stable at 5 00 5 60 0 86 1 03 and 1 00 1 06 mg l respectively which were about half lower than the initial concentrations 2 moving in horizontal and vertical infiltration direction do 1 mg l no3 close to the detection limit and toc which decreased by 91 concentrations were markedly lower at well a and at 5 m deep which was an o2 no3 reduction zone mn2 reached a maximum concentration at well b and at 10 m deep while fe2 concentration increase to be stable which was an fe mn reduction zone so4 2 concentration was markedly lower at well c and at the depth increased from 10 m which was a so4 2 reduction zone 3 seasonality in the redox environment was mainly reflected in concentrations of the redox indices rather than the spatial variations and redox zone ranges seasonality results in a 30 fluctuation of fe2 and mn2 contents in redox zones and markedly fluctuation of do toc nh4 and so4 2 contents in river water 4 the microbial community structure and diversity data confirmed the redox zonation results indicated by the redox indices mn2 and fe2 explained most of the microbial variability both in the fluctuation zone 18 5 and 14 5 and the saturated zone 27 7 and 26 2 pseudomonas flavobacterium and limnobacter were the dominant bacteria in the o2 no3 fe mn and so4 2 reduction zones respectively this research has obtained and exhibited the redox conditions of rbf system with high fe2 and mn2 contents which was of great value for water supply along the songhua river in northeast china more critically a systematic method was proposed to study redox conditions in rbf from multiple perspectives of hydrogeology hydrochemistry and microbiology especially in the areas with primary pollution feature redox indices and microbial responses are non

3427,the availability and quality of limited groundwater resources in egypt are negatively affected by both natural and anthropogenic forces it is crucial to understand the recharge sources and mechanisms of country scale aquifers in order to develop sustainable management scenarios for egypt s groundwater resources in this study we compiled all historical hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o stable isotopic compositions of 1618 ground and surface water samples collected for seven major aquifer and reservoir systems in egypt these data were then hosted in a public domain web map application https

keywords web application gis groundwater stable isotope aquifers sustainability egypt 1 introduction groundwater resources in arid and semi arid environments contribute to economic social and environmental security and sustainability and the availability and quality of groundwater in these regions are impacted by both natural and human interventions ahmed et al 2014 sultan et al 2013 2015 egypt is one of these environments and it is currently suffering from significant interventions that affect groundwater resources e g abdelrahman et al 2022 agoubi 2021 ahmed 2020 mabrouk et al 2018 kamara et al 2022 as a result of climate change changing rainfall amounts patterns and frequencies associated drought events changes in temperature cyclicities and land cover and land use changes all affect egypt s groundwater resources ahmed and wiese 2019 omar et al 2021 egypt s recent climate change trends indicate a general decrease in rainfall increased warming and a more frequent extreme temperatures hulme et al 2001 population growth surface water damming groundwater overexploitation and pollution are examples of anthropogenic forces that affect egypt s groundwater resources population growth for example increases demands for and raises costs of groundwater supplies ahmed et al 2021 essam et al 2020 understanding how anthropogenic and natural processes influence groundwater availability and quality in egypt is critical for sustainability possible recharge source s of each aquifer system are of prime importance traditionally the locations and rates of aquifer recharge and the aquifers responses to natural and anthropogenic forces have been investigated by collecting and examining field observations ahmed et al 2013 essam et al 2020 mohamed et al 2015 scanlon et al 2002 sultan et al 2011 these observations include geophysical hydrogeological and geochemical measurements in addition to others these measurements are conventionally used to locate the groundwater table quantify volumes in storage map spatial domains of recharge and depletion quantify recharge and discharge rates and examine groundwater quality abdelmohsen et al 2019 ahmed 2020 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 dailey et al 2015 doolittle et al 2006 fallatah et al 2019 2017 manu and preko 2014 mohamed et al 2017 niyazi et al 2018 2019 sultan et al 2019 2013 however country scale measurements are challenging to fund and difficult to collect because the majority of these recharge areas are inaccessible geochemical analyses for example require researchers to collect surface and groundwater samples and analyse their chemical and isotopic compositions the chemical analyses provide direct indicators of water quality while the isotopic compositions provide age and recharge indicators water isotopes provide unique fingerprints for different types of water jasechko 2019 cook and herczeg 2000 clark and fritz 1997 stable water isotopes hydrogen 1h 2h oxygen 16o 18o have been used extensively to map the spatial distributions and physical characteristics e g evaporation mixing of different water types jasechko 2019 cook and herczeg 2000 clark and fritz 1997 coplen 1996 fossil waters for example have depleted isotopic compositions compared to meteoric waters mixing between these two end members can also be reflected in the isotopic compositions of water samples this mixing provides a direct indicator of recharge locations because a progressive depletion in isotopic composition is expected as distance from the recharge areas increases abouelmagd et al 2014 sultan et al 2011 2010 despite the importance of water s isotopic compositions no published studies combined these measurements for any aquifer in egypt fig 1 in an accessible database some researchers always feel the need to collect additional isotopic data that have been already collected but not combined or shared in a single database more resources and efforts could be saved and more meritorious science questions could be addressed in fact the entire hydrogeologic system could be investigated if such database was constructed and made available to the scientific community availability of open access datasets on the other hand informs larger scientific community increases confidence in results and findings encourages multiple perspectives enriches research questions and outcomes enables more connection and collaboration between researchers and advances innovative findings and discoveries e g huston et al 2019 piwowar et al 2018 popkin 2019 in this study we 1 compiled all historical country wide isotopic composition dataset for surface and groundwater samples in egypt 2 innovatively integrated the collected datasets with web based geographic information system gis technologies that enables users to access navigate display and analyze the isotopic composition of any water sample in egypt and 3 used the developed web application to provide improved understanding of the country wide water resources isotopic composition and to investigate the recharge sources and mechanisms of and provide sustainable management scenarios for the nationwide aquifer systems fig 1 this cost effective approach will 1 guide locations and techniques for future field data collection 2 reduce time efforts and resources required for field activities 3 enable improved understanding the country scale stable isotopic compositions of water resources 4 enhance understanding of recharge mechanisms across the entire country and 5 enable the scientific community to address country scale science questions in an unprecedented way 2 isotopic composition of water samples 2 1 water stable isotopes and their applications the oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h stable isotopes of water serve as ideal tracers for investigating water resources these measurements enable researchers to explore the circulation of the whole water cycle from precipitation to surface water and groundwater clark and fritz 1997 mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 they are affected by meteorological processes e g temperature humidity condensation geographical factors e g latitude longitude altitude and to lesser extent by chemical reactions with geologic materials they are used for various groundwater applications such as understanding the aquifer recharge and discharge processes evaporative effects flow and interconnections between aquifers the fate and transport of pollutants surface water groundwater connections and groundwater mixing processes de bondt et al 2018 these kinds of information are often crucial for improving groundwater management especially under arid to hyper arid conditions clark and fritz 1997 2 2 sampling and analytical techniques water samples are usually collected in high density polyethylene bottles tightly capped after sample acquisition these samples are then sent to a laboratory for isotopic analyses two techniques have been applied to measure the isotopic abundance ratio of water samples classical isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms was used in past decades to measure stable water isotopes kendall and caldwell 1998 it measures the relative water isotope ratios by analyzing the mass differences jung et al 2013 external preparation systems and high pressure gases are required to convert h2o to pure h2 and co or equilibrate with co2 or h2 as the irms accepts only the non condensable gas horita and kendall 2004 recently the use of the newly developed laser absorption spectroscopy las technique offers an optical fast precise and cost effective alternative wassenaar et al 2009 las instruments determine the isotopic ratios by measuring the energy absorption in the near infra red range through the rotational vibrational transitions in three forms h2 18o h2 16o and hd16o of the water molecule van geldern and barth 2012 compared to the irms the las technique has the advantages of simple preparation and operation with smaller sample volumes van geldern and barth 2012 the isotope abundances are reported as negative or positive deviations of isotopic ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o relative to a standard value defined as vienna standard mean ocean water craig 1961 in terms of delta δ notation in permil parts per thousand and defined as follows δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r sample and r standard represent the value of 18o 16o and 2h 1h in the collected samples and the standard samples respectively the δ18o δ2h plot for water samples is used to define depleted fossil and enriched meteoric end members of water samples 3

2008 4 web based gis database 4 1 database contents the ground and surface water isotopic compositions were collated from 55 articles that were published between 1974 and 2021 see supplementary material for a detailed list two search engines were used in this process web of science and google scholar several indicative search words were used such as groundwater isotope groundwater egypt egypt aquifer and egypt surface water we were interested in hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopic data no other isotopic analyses e g carbon 14 radium 226 or uranium 238 were included only egypt samples were collected even if the published study targeted an aquifer that extends into multiple countries e g the nubian aquifer for articles that did not provide the latitude and longitude for water samples a location map that showed the well or sample distribution was registered geographic coordinate system in a gis environment then the sample locations were manually digitized around 25 17 and 58 of the compiled articles were published during 1974 to 2000 2001 to 2010 and 2011 to 2021 respectively the δ2h and δ18o isotopic data were collected for 1618 ground and surface water samples both irms and las were used to measure the isotopic composition of the collected water samples more than 95 of these samples are groundwater samples groundwater samples were collected from mechanical and hand dug wells penetrating any of the seven aquifer systems e g nile valley and delta alluvial nubian coastal moghra carbonate and fractured basement these samples were collected from the eastern desert western desert nile valley and delta and sinai fig 3 the surface water samples were collected from the nile river irrigation canals springs and seawater the collected data are arranged in 20 fields as listed in table 1 4 2 database structure the isotopic composition of ground and surface water samples in egypt are hosted in a web map application https bit ly 3n9mtrm this application was created using web appbuilder in the arcgis online platform fig 3 arcgis online provides a complete cloud based interactive gis mapping technique for different purposes and applications users can access this database through computers smartphones and tablets this application is intended to store the compiled dataset and allow users to access navigate display and analyze the isotopic composition of any ground or surface water sample in egypt the developed application is supported by the default zoom full screen and default extent web tools fig 3 additional information about the applications tools is provided in the supplementary material 5 use of gis application to investigate isotopic compositions of egypt groundwater resources the generated web application was used to investigate the isotopic compositions of groundwater resources in the seven egyptian aquifer systems the query tool was used to select all samples based on the aquifer name e g alluvial nile valley and nile delta coastal moghra carbonate nubian and fractured basement the isotopic data is presented in terms of geographic settings e g eastern desert western desert nile valley and delta and sinai for each of the investigated aquifer systems because most of the wells are not regularly sampled and measured temporal variation in the isotopic composition was not assessed in this study the isotopic compositions of different aquifers in egypt were presented and discussed separately in reference to the global meteoric water line gmwl and or the east mediterranean water line emwl the gmwl and emwl lines were defined as δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and δ2h 8 δ18o 22 gat and carmi 1970 respectively higher 22 deuterium excess d excess or d values for precipitation over the eastern mediterranean region i e lands around the southern and eastern shores of the mediterranean sea compared to the gmwl 10 might indicate intense evaporation over this water body under conditions of low relative humidity and high surface water temperature gat and carmi 1970 clark and fritz 1997 heydarizad et al 2019 the mediterranean effect is evident from the analysis of modern precipitation s δ18o and δ2h data at six stations in egypt fig 2 table s1 in the supplementary material these isotopic compositions data are extracted from the international atomic energy agency iaea wiser database available at https nucleus iaea org wiser index aspx the average d excess values were high range from 13 to 18 for the stations along the mediterranean coast named sidi barrani marsa matruh alexandria el arish and rafah compared to low d excess value 7 of inland cairo station about 150 km south of the coastline fig 2 this observation could indicate that modern precipitation over the northern part of egypt is originated mostly from the mediterranean atmospheric masses while this effect is diminished southward descriptive statistics minimum maximum average 1st quartile 3rd quartile and standard deviation for δ18o δ2h and d excess values for each aquifer systems are listed in table s2 in the supplementary material based on univariate statistics variation among the different measurements for each aquifer shows a clear distinction table s2 in the supplementary material in addition cronbach s alpha reliability coefficient was used to evaluate the collected isotopic data and to ensure internal consistency of the different measures raykov 1997 the value of cronbach s alpha reliability ranged between 0 4 and 0 6 which is classified to be reliable enough according to hair et al 2010 the global gmwl and regional emwl reference lines average precipitation isotopic composition for the aforementioned six stations table s1 in the supplementary material recent rainfall and occasional flash flood events in 2018 and 2019 respectively over the northern part of the eastern desert wannous et al 2021 along with other possible recharge sources e g surface freshwater seawater drainage water upward leakage from deeper aquifers direct rainfall and or flashflood events were discussed below for each aquifer system 5 1 alluvial aquifer isotopic compositions of groundwaters of the alluvial aquifers in sinai δ2h 23 46 5 40 δ18o 4 27 0 89 are plotted between the gmwl and emwl close to the average isotopic composition of modern precipitation from the rafah and el arish stations 9 86 to 8 81 for δ2h 3 48 to 3 22 for δ18o indicating their main recharge from modern precipitation fig 4 the lower slope 4 5 and intercept 3 7 of the line fitted to sinai groundwater samples might be due to evaporation from wadi runoff prior to infiltration alluvial groundwaters from the eastern desert δ2h 35 68 16 55 δ18o 4 62 2 53 however are mostly plotted below the gmwl with a lower slope 6 2 and intercept 6 8 fig 4 suggesting evaporation and or mixing with evaporated water the wide variation and depletion in isotopic composition of alluvial aquifers groundwater in the eastern desert 8 9 to 5 2 for δ18o 63 2 to 32 for δ2h cannot be attributed only to modern precipitation and or draining as wadi runoff from the red sea hills upward leakage from deep nubian aquifers depleted in isotopic composition section 5 6 along complex faults is suggested as an additional recharge source for shallow alluvial aquifers in the eastern desert and sinai 5 2 nile valley and delta aquifers groundwaters within the nile delta and valley aquifers exhibit a wide range of variation from 3 8 to 6 5 and from 30 3 to 42 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 5 most of the groundwater samples are plotted on the mixing line connecting the nile water components pre and post high dam waters δ2h 25 79 5 46 δ18o 3 16 0 97 fig 5 suggesting that their main recharge comes from the nile river and irrigation canal and drain systems these systems intensively dissect the nile valley and delta for cultivation and irrigation purposes the deviation of groundwater samples from the gmwl indicates that there is evaporation before recharge and or mixing with highly evaporated water e g irrigation return flow and wastewater this is also highlighted from the lower slopes 6 9 and 5 8 and intercepts 1 1 and 4 5 of the evaporation lines fitted to the nile valley and delta samples fig 5 within the nile valley and delta region water experiences varied evaporation through circulation between irrigation canals irrigated soils drainage systems and recycling drainage water for irrigation this evaporation process ultimately ends up in isotopic enrichment prior to infiltration into the aquifer the other groundwaters which are more depleted than the nile waters could be interpreted to represent a mixing between pre high dam nile water and fossil water from deeper aquifer systems e g carbonate and or nubian aquifers discharge of these deeper systems through the complex fault systems occurs within the alluvial settings on the fringes of desert surrounding the nile valley and delta which are currently subject to reclamation and cultivation 5 3 coastal aquifers the isotopic ratios of groundwaters from sinai along the gulf of suez the gulf of aqaba and the mediterranean sea δ2h 18 31 15 9 δ18o 2 72 2 66 fig 6 a the eastern desert along the red sea coast δ2h 2 36 16 71 δ18o 0 04 2 79 fig 6a the northern portions of the western desert along the mediterranean sea δ2h 14 03 16 69 δ18o 3 23 2 87 fig 6b have isotopic compositions that are mostly similar to those of modern rainfall and floodwater from local storm events δ2h 4 52 15 98 δ18o 2 01 3 02 moreover coastal groundwaters from the sinai fig 6a and the north western desert fig 6b were mostly plotted between the gmwl and emwl whereas those from the eastern desert are located below the gmwl fig 6a this difference indicates different moisture sources of precipitation modern precipitation recharge is supported by the geographic setting of most samples at the mouths of large ephemeral streams in sinai and the eastern desert these streams dissect the crystalline rocks of the sinai massifs and the red sea hills respectively collect rainfalls and or occasional flashfloods and ultimately drain into the coastal plains of the mediterranean sea and the red sea occasional heavy rainstorms resulting in severe flash floods with a magnitude of up to 76 and 100 mm day were recorded for the southern sinai and the eastern desert respectively the δ2h δ18o diagram also shows that some samples from the sinai those along the gulf of suez and the eastern desert have isotopic composition more depleted than the current rainfall fig 6a suggesting a contribution from fossil water e g nubian aquifer nubian aquifer waters are likely leaking upward along the deep seated faults into the shallow alluvial and or carbonate coastal aquifers in coastal plains of the gulf of suez and the red sea the deviation of some coastal groundwater samples from the gmwl might be due to several natural and anthropogenic processes such as evaporative isotopic enrichment of the wadi flash floods indicated by dashed lines fig 6a and 6b evaporation from the water table seawater intrusion mixing with evaporated waters from agricultural or domestic activities and or contribution from salt marshes and lakes along the coastal plains 5 4 moghra aquifer the isotopic composition of groundwater from the moghra aquifer δ2h 1 43 6 57 δ18o 0 14 1 88 is mostly similar to that of the nile waters especially the pre high dam one 0 60 for δ18o 4 30 for δ2h this suggests a contribution from groundwater of the nile delta aquifer fig 7 however the nile water components pre and post high dam could not explain the observed isotopic depletion of some moghra groundwater samples implying a contribution from a depleted isotopic source in the western desert the nubian aquifer groundwaters are under high artesian pressure and suffer from upward leakage through extensive deep seated faults into the overlying shallow aquifers sultan et al 2011 2006 this observation supports the assumption that moghra groundwater represents a mixing between the nile waters and fossil nubian groundwaters as indicated by mixing lines and lower values of slope 3 1 and intercept 1 of the evaporation line fitted to the collected samples fig 7 5 5 carbonate aquifer groundwaters from the carbonate aquifer in sinai is more depleted δ2h 30 50 3 14 δ18o 5 49 0 84 compared to those from the carbonate aquifer in west and east desert fringes of the nile valley δ2h 10 09 16 03 δ18o 2 11 1 95 fig 8 these samples are mostly plotted between the gmwl and emwl and have depleted isotopic compositions comparable to that of modern precipitation rafah and el arish stations fig 8 this could be because sinai groundwaters might represent a mixing between depleted water from the nubian aquifer and modern meteoric water a similar mixed origin is also suggested for the carbonate aquifer at the eastern and western desert fringes of the nile valley fig 8 because rainfall is scarce over the western desert fig 2 the most enriched isotopic composition for west fringe carbonate groundwaters might be related to lateral recharge from adjacent nile valley aquifer fig 8 also shows that groundwater from the eastern carbonate aquifer is more enriched in isotopic composition than the western one this may be due to large contributions from modern precipitation fallen over the red sea hills and draining westward through numerous wadi channels to the nile valley where alluvial and carbonate aquifers are dominant the observed slopes and intercepts for carbonate aquifer in different settings of egypt could therefore reflect different precipitation moisture sources evaporation and or paleowater mixing 5 6 nubian aquifer groundwater samples from the nubian aquifer in the western desert are plotted below the gmwl δ2h 77 07 14 27 δ18o 9 90 2 09 these samples are more depleted in their isotopic compositions compared to those collected from the nubian aquifer in eastern desert δ2h 47 41 10 11 δ18o 7 35 4 76 and sinai δ2h 45 71 12 17 δ18o 6 84 1 42 fig 9 however some of the groundwater samples in the vicinity of east uweinat and lake nasser in southwest egypt are enriched in isotopic composition δ2h 1 85 16 75 δ18o 0 55 1 88 this suggests that enriched water from lake nasser and or modern precipitation over northern sudan contributed to the aquifer through networks of densely fractured and karstified bedrocks local precipitation and floodwater events average modern precipitation from cairo and most groundwater samples from the nubian aquifer in the eastern desert are plotted at and below the gmwl fig 9 most groundwater samples from the nubian aquifer in sinai together with average modern precipitation along the mediterranean sea e g rafah and el arish are plotted between the gmwl and emwl this reflects the different moisture sources of precipitation that contribute to the recharge of the nubian aquifer in the sinai and the eastern desert the contribution from modern precipitation is also indicated from regression lines of nearly same slope to the gmwl fig 9 the outcrops of the nubian aquifer at the foothills of the sinai massif and red sea hills are recharge windows and receive considerable rainfall events e g 76 and 100 mm day recorded for the southern sinai and the eastern desert respectively that mixed with depleted fossil groundwater of the nubian aquifer the mixing process depends mainly on the structural elements that control the connection between these two waters as well as the traveling distance from recharge zones 5 7 fractured basement aquifer the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples collected from the fractured basement aquifers in the eastern desert δ2h 4 97 11 24 δ18o 0 91 2 15 and southern sinai δ2h 20 92 5 79 δ18o 3 96 1 15 are plotted close to the average rainfall isotopic compositions of three rainfall stations in egypt cairo rafah and el arish fig 10 samples collected from the eastern desert had similar isotopic compositions to recent precipitation events e g february 2018 and floodwaters associated with heavy storms e g february 2019 indicating their modern meteoric origin fig 10 the average modern precipitation from cairo recent precipitation event and floodwater and groundwater from basement aquifer in the eastern desert are plotted at and below the gmwl whereas sinai groundwaters together with average modern precipitation from el arish and rafah were plotted between the gmwl and mmwl fig 10 suggesting different moisture sources of precipitation over the basement terrain in southern sinai and the eastern desert the observed deviation from gmwl for eastern desert groundwaters slope 4 7 intercept 0 4 are attributed to varying evaporative isotope enrichment of runoff along wadi channels of the red sea hills in addition more enriched δ18o and δ2h values of up to 5 35 and 22 respectively are related to mixing with the isotopically enriched tailing storage pond waters from sukari gold mining activities in the eastern desert 6 summary and conclusions egypt like any other arid environment is seeking additional freshwater resources to actively mitigate challenges posed by both natural e g climate changes and anthropogenic e g population growth groundwater overexploitation interventions given egypt s limited surface water allocation from the nile river and the expected reduction in this allocation the current egyptian tendency is to increase the use of groundwater resources at the expense of the limited nile river waters governmental agencies and research sectors are trying to develop a sustainable groundwater management scenario for groundwater resources in egypt key to the sustainable use of these resources is understanding their recharge sources and mechanisms collecting field measurements e g geophysical hydrogeological geochemical and constructing and calibrating numerical models e g groundwater flow rainfall runoff provide significant information in this pursuit however the country scale field measurements that are also required for modelling exercise are challenging to collect because the majority of these systems are generally inaccessible there is an urgent need to combine country scale field measurements in a single database that is accessible to researchers decision makers and local communities this database could be used to guide future field data collection this approach will minimize efforts and resources required for field activities and enable researchers to address unprecedented country and aquifer scale science questions in addition the developed approach could also be used to explore the sustainable use scenarios of groundwater resources in these aquifer systems analysis of historical δ2h and δ18o stable isotopic compositions compiled for 1618 water samples collected from the major aquifer systems e g the nile valley and delta alluvial nubian sandstone coastal moghra carbonate and fractured basement and surface water bodies e g the nile river lake nasser floodwater red sea and mediterranean sea in egypt available at https bit ly 3n9mtrm indicate that 1 both alluvial and coastal aquifer systems are recharged from modern rainfall floodwaters and upward leakage from deep aquifer systems these systems could be used in sustainable ways if the extraction rates were reduced to match the modern recharge rates and extraction activities were located near the discharge sources of the deeper systems 2 the nile valley and delta moghra and carbonate systems are receiving recharge from the nile river modern rainfall irrigation canals and drains and upward leakage from deep aquifers groundwater extraction from these systems should be minimized to match the modern recharge rates from rainfall and nile waters and should be located close to the discharge locations of the deeper systems in order to achieve groundwater sustainability in these systems 3 the fractured basement aquifers are recharged by modern rainfall and floodwaters to achieve sustainability extraction from these systems should target areas of higher rainfall rates 4 the nubian aquifer contains mainly fossil water however extraction activities should target regions that receive present day recharge in areas of higher rainfall rates e g foothills of mountainous areas or close to surface water bodies

3427,the availability and quality of limited groundwater resources in egypt are negatively affected by both natural and anthropogenic forces it is crucial to understand the recharge sources and mechanisms of country scale aquifers in order to develop sustainable management scenarios for egypt s groundwater resources in this study we compiled all historical hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o stable isotopic compositions of 1618 ground and surface water samples collected for seven major aquifer and reservoir systems in egypt these data were then hosted in a public domain web map application https bit ly 3n9mtrm that enables users to access navigate display and analyze the isotopic composition of any water sample in egypt the developed application and customized web tools were then used to provide improved understanding of the country wide water resources isotopic composition and to investigate the recharge sources and mechanisms of and provide sustainable management scenarios for the seven major egyptian aquifer systems results indicate that 1 the alluvial and coastal aquifers are recharged from modern rainfall floodwaters and upward leakage from deep aquifers 2 the nile valley and delta moghra and carbonate aquifers are receiving recharge from the nile river modern rainfall irrigation canals and drains and upward leakage from deep aquifers 3 the nubian aquifer receives modern recharge in areas of higher rainfall or close to surface water reservoirs and 4 the fractured basement aquifers are recharged from modern rainfall and floodwaters the developed cost effective

keywords web application gis groundwater stable isotope aquifers sustainability egypt 1 introduction groundwater resources in arid and semi arid environments contribute to economic social and environmental security and sustainability and the availability and quality of groundwater in these regions are impacted by both natural and human interventions ahmed et al 2014 sultan et al 2013 2015 egypt is one of these environments and it is currently suffering from significant interventions that affect groundwater resources e g abdelrahman et al 2022 agoubi 2021 ahmed 2020 mabrouk et al 2018 kamara et al 2022 as a result of climate change changing rainfall amounts patterns and frequencies associated drought events changes in temperature cyclicities and land cover and land use changes all affect egypt s groundwater resources ahmed and wiese 2019 omar et al 2021 egypt s recent climate change trends indicate a general decrease in rainfall increased warming and a more frequent extreme temperatures hulme et al 2001 population growth surface water damming groundwater overexploitation and pollution are examples of anthropogenic forces that affect egypt s groundwater resources population growth for example increases demands for and raises costs of groundwater supplies ahmed et al 2021 essam et al 2020 understanding how anthropogenic and natural processes influence groundwater availability and quality in egypt is critical for sustainability possible recharge source s of each aquifer system are of prime importance traditionally the locations and rates of aquifer recharge and the aquifers responses to natural and anthropogenic forces have been investigated by collecting and examining field observations ahmed et al 2013 essam et al 2020 mohamed et al 2015 scanlon et al 2002 sultan et al 2011 these observations include geophysical hydrogeological and geochemical measurements in addition to others these measurements are conventionally used to locate the groundwater table quantify volumes in storage map spatial domains of recharge and depletion quantify recharge and discharge rates and examine groundwater quality abdelmohsen et al 2019 ahmed 2020 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 dailey et al 2015 doolittle et al 2006 fallatah et al 2019 2017 manu and preko 2014 mohamed et al 2017 niyazi et al 2018 2019 sultan et al 2019 2013 however country scale measurements are challenging to fund and difficult to collect because the majority of these recharge areas are inaccessible geochemical analyses for example require researchers to collect surface and groundwater samples and analyse their chemical and isotopic compositions the chemical analyses provide direct indicators of water quality while the isotopic compositions provide age and recharge indicators water isotopes provide unique fingerprints for different types of water jasechko 2019 cook and herczeg 2000 clark and fritz 1997 stable water isotopes hydrogen 1h 2h oxygen 16o 18o have been used extensively to map the spatial distributions and physical characteristics e g evaporation mixing of different water types jasechko 2019 cook and herczeg 2000 clark and fritz 1997 coplen 1996 fossil waters for example have depleted isotopic compositions compared to meteoric waters mixing between these two end members can also be reflected in the isotopic compositions of water samples this mixing provides a direct indicator of recharge locations because a progressive depletion in isotopic composition is expected as distance from the recharge areas increases abouelmagd et al 2014 sultan et al 2011 2010 despite the importance of water s isotopic compositions no published studies combined these measurements for any aquifer in egypt fig 1 in an accessible database some researchers always feel the need to collect additional isotopic data that have been already collected but not combined or shared in a single database more resources and efforts could be saved and more meritorious science questions could be addressed in fact the entire hydrogeologic system could be investigated if such database was constructed and made available to the scientific community availability of open access datasets on the other hand informs larger scientific community increases confidence in results and findings encourages multiple perspectives enriches research questions and outcomes enables more connection and collaboration between researchers and advances innovative findings and discoveries e g huston et al 2019 piwowar et al 2018 popkin 2019 in this study we 1 compiled all historical country wide isotopic composition dataset for surface and groundwater samples in egypt 2 innovatively integrated the collected datasets with web based geographic information system gis technologies that enables users to access navigate display and analyze the isotopic composition of any water sample in egypt and 3 used the developed web application to provide improved understanding of the

science questions in an unprecedented way 2 isotopic composition of water samples 2 1 water stable isotopes and their applications the oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h stable isotopes of water serve as ideal tracers for investigating water resources these measurements enable researchers to explore the circulation of the whole water cycle from precipitation to surface water and groundwater clark and fritz 1997 mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 they are affected by meteorological processes e g temperature humidity condensation geographical factors e g latitude longitude altitude and to lesser extent by chemical reactions with geologic materials they are used for various groundwater applications such as understanding the aquifer recharge and discharge processes evaporative effects flow and interconnections between aquifers the fate and transport of pollutants surface water groundwater connections and groundwater mixing processes de bondt et al 2018 these kinds of information are often crucial for improving groundwater management especially under arid to hyper arid conditions clark and fritz 1997 2 2 sampling and analytical techniques water samples are usually collected in high density polyethylene bottles tightly capped after sample acquisition these samples are then sent to a laboratory for isotopic analyses two techniques have been applied to measure the isotopic abundance ratio of water samples classical isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms was used in past decades to measure stable water isotopes kendall and caldwell 1998 it measures the relative water isotope ratios by analyzing the mass differences jung et al 2013 external preparation systems and high pressure gases are required to convert h2o to pure h2 and co or equilibrate with co2 or h2 as the irms accepts only the non condensable gas horita and kendall 2004 recently the use of the newly developed laser absorption spectroscopy las technique offers an optical fast precise and cost effective alternative wassenaar et al 2009 las instruments determine the isotopic ratios by measuring the energy absorption in the near infra red range through the rotational vibrational transitions in three forms h2 18o h2 16o and hd16o of the water molecule van geldern and barth 2012 compared to the irms the las technique has the advantages of simple preparation and operation with smaller sample volumes van geldern and barth 2012 the isotope abundances are reported as negative or positive deviations of isotopic ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o relative to a standard value defined as vienna standard mean ocean water craig 1961 in terms of delta δ notation in permil parts per thousand and defined as follows δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r sample and r standard represent the value of 18o 16o and 2h 1h in the collected samples and the standard samples respectively the δ18o δ2h plot for water samples is used to define depleted fossil and enriched meteoric end members of water samples 3

2008 4 web based gis database 4 1 database contents the ground and surface water isotopic compositions were collated from 55 articles that were published between 1974 and 2021 see supplementary material for a detailed list two search engines were used in this process web of science and google scholar several indicative search words were used such as groundwater isotope groundwater egypt egypt aquifer and egypt surface water we were interested in hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopic data no other isotopic analyses e g carbon 14 radium 226 or uranium 238 were included only egypt samples were collected even if the published study targeted an aquifer that extends into multiple countries e g the nubian aquifer for articles that did not provide the latitude and longitude for water samples a location map that showed the well or sample distribution was registered geographic coordinate system in a gis environment then the sample locations were manually digitized around 25 17 and 58 of the compiled articles were published during 1974 to 2000 2001 to 2010 and 2011 to 2021 respectively the δ2h and δ18o isotopic data were collected for 1618 ground and surface water samples both irms and las were used to measure the isotopic composition of the collected water samples more than 95 of these samples are groundwater samples groundwater samples were collected from mechanical and hand dug wells penetrating any of the seven aquifer systems e g nile valley and delta alluvial nubian coastal moghra carbonate and fractured basement these samples were collected from the eastern desert western desert nile valley and delta and sinai fig 3 the surface water samples were collected from the nile river irrigation canals springs and seawater the collected data are arranged in 20 fields as listed in table 1 4 2 database structure the isotopic composition of ground and surface water samples in egypt are hosted in a web map application https bit ly 3n9mtrm this application was created using web appbuilder in the arcgis online platform fig 3 arcgis online provides a complete cloud based interactive gis mapping technique for different purposes and applications users can access this database through computers smartphones and tablets this application is intended to store the compiled dataset and allow users to access navigate display and analyze the isotopic composition of any ground or surface water sample in egypt the developed application is supported by the default zoom full screen and default extent web tools fig 3 additional information about the applications tools is provided in the supplementary material 5 use of gis application to investigate isotopic compositions of egypt groundwater resources the generated web application was used to investigate the isotopic compositions of groundwater resources in the seven egyptian aquifer systems the query tool was used to select all samples based on the aquifer name e g alluvial nile valley and nile delta coastal moghra carbonate nubian and fractured basement the isotopic data is presented in terms of geographic settings e g eastern desert western desert nile valley and delta and sinai for each of the investigated aquifer systems because most of the wells are not regularly sampled and measured temporal variation in the isotopic composition was not assessed in this study the isotopic compositions of different aquifers in egypt were presented and discussed separately in reference to the global meteoric water line gmwl and or the east mediterranean water line emwl the gmwl and emwl lines were defined as δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and δ2h 8 δ18o 22 gat and carmi 1970 respectively higher 22 deuterium excess d excess or d values for precipitation over the eastern mediterranean region i e lands around the southern and eastern shores of the mediterranean sea compared to the gmwl 10 might indicate intense evaporation over this water body under conditions of low relative humidity and high surface water temperature gat and carmi 1970 clark and fritz 1997 heydarizad et al 2019 the mediterranean effect is evident from the analysis of modern precipitation s δ18o and δ2h data at six stations in egypt fig 2 table s1 in the supplementary material these isotopic compositions data are extracted from the international atomic energy agency iaea wiser database available at https nucleus iaea org wiser index aspx the average d excess values were high range from 13 to 18 for the stations along the mediterranean coast named sidi barrani marsa matruh alexandria el arish and rafah compared to low d excess value 7 of inland cairo station about 150 km south of the coastline fig 2 this observation could indicate that modern precipitation over the northern part of egypt is originated mostly from the mediterranean atmospheric masses while this effect is diminished southward descriptive statistics minimum maximum average 1st quartile 3rd quartile and standard deviation for δ18o δ2h and d excess values for each aquifer systems are listed in table s2 in the supplementary material based on univariate statistics variation among the different measurements for each aquifer shows a clear distinction table s2 in the supplementary material in addition cronbach s alpha reliability coefficient was used to evaluate the collected isotopic data and to ensure internal consistency of the different measures raykov 1997 the value of cronbach s alpha reliability ranged between 0 4 and 0 6 which is classified to be reliable enough according to hair et al 2010 the global gmwl and regional emwl reference lines average precipitation isotopic composition for the aforementioned six stations table s1 in the supplementary material recent rainfall and occasional flash flood events in 2018 and 2019 respectively over the northern part of the eastern desert wannous et al 2021 along with other possible recharge sources e g surface freshwater seawater drainage water upward leakage from deeper aquifers direct rainfall and or flashflood events were discussed below for each aquifer system 5 1 alluvial aquifer isotopic compositions of groundwaters of the alluvial aquifers in sinai δ2h 23 46 5 40 δ18o 4 27 0 89 are plotted between the gmwl and emwl close to the average isotopic composition of modern precipitation from the rafah and el arish stations 9 86 to 8 81 for δ2h 3 48 to 3 22 for δ18o indicating their main recharge from modern precipitation fig 4 the lower slope 4 5 and intercept 3 7 of the line fitted to sinai groundwater samples might be due to evaporation from wadi runoff prior to infiltration alluvial groundwaters from the eastern desert δ2h 35 68 16 55 δ18o 4 62 2 53 however are mostly plotted below the gmwl with a lower slope 6 2 and intercept 6 8 fig 4 suggesting evaporation and or mixing with evaporated water the wide variation and depletion in isotopic composition of alluvial aquifers groundwater in the eastern desert 8 9 to 5 2 for δ18o 63 2 to 32 for δ2h cannot be attributed only to modern precipitation and or draining as wadi runoff from the red sea hills upward leakage from deep nubian aquifers depleted in isotopic composition section 5 6 along complex faults is suggested as an additional recharge source for shallow alluvial aquifers in the eastern desert and sinai 5 2 nile valley and delta aquifers groundwaters within the nile delta and valley aquifers exhibit a wide range of variation from 3 8 to 6 5 and from 30 3 to 42 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 5 most of the groundwater samples are plotted on the mixing line connecting the nile water components pre and post high dam waters δ2h 25 79 5 46 δ18o 3 16 0 97 fig 5 suggesting that their main recharge comes from the nile river and irrigation canal and drain systems these systems intensively dissect the nile valley and delta for cultivation and irrigation purposes the deviation of groundwater samples from the gmwl indicates that there is evaporation before recharge and or mixing with highly evaporated water e g irrigation return flow and wastewater this is also highlighted from the lower slopes 6 9 and 5 8 and intercepts 1 1 and 4 5 of the evaporation lines fitted to the nile valley and delta samples fig 5 within the nile valley and delta region water experiences varied evaporation through circulation between irrigation canals irrigated soils drainage systems and recycling drainage water for irrigation this evaporation process ultimately ends up in isotopic enrichment prior to infiltration into the aquifer the other groundwaters which are more depleted than the nile waters could be interpreted to represent a mixing between pre high dam nile water and fossil water from deeper aquifer systems e g carbonate and or nubian aquifers discharge of these deeper systems through the complex fault systems occurs within the alluvial settings on the fringes of desert surrounding the nile valley and delta which are currently subject to reclamation and cultivation 5 3 coastal aquifers the isotopic ratios of groundwaters from sinai along the gulf of suez the gulf of aqaba and the mediterranean sea δ2h 18 31 15 9 δ18o 2 72 2 66 fig 6 a the eastern desert along the red sea coast δ2h 2 36 16 71 δ18o 0 04 2 79 fig 6a the northern portions of the western desert along the mediterranean sea δ2h 14 03 16 69 δ18o 3 23 2 87 fig 6b have isotopic compositions that are mostly similar to those of modern rainfall and floodwater from local storm events δ2h 4 52 15 98 δ18o 2 01 3 02 moreover coastal groundwaters from the sinai fig 6a and the north western desert fig 6b were mostly plotted between the gmwl and emwl whereas those from the eastern desert are located below the gmwl fig 6a this difference indicates different moisture sources of precipitation modern precipitation recharge is supported by the geographic setting of most samples at the mouths of large ephemeral streams in sinai and the eastern desert these streams dissect the crystalline rocks of the sinai massifs and the red sea hills respectively collect rainfalls and or occasional flashfloods and ultimately drain into the coastal plains of the mediterranean sea and the red sea occasional heavy rainstorms resulting in severe flash floods with a magnitude of up to 76 and 100 mm day were recorded for the southern sinai and the eastern desert respectively the δ2h δ18o diagram also shows that some samples from the sinai those along the gulf of suez and the eastern desert have isotopic composition more depleted than the current rainfall fig 6a suggesting a contribution from fossil water e g nubian aquifer nubian aquifer waters are likely leaking upward along the deep seated faults into the shallow alluvial and or carbonate coastal aquifers in coastal plains of the gulf of suez and the red sea the deviation of some coastal groundwater samples from the gmwl might be due to several natural and anthropogenic processes such as evaporative isotopic enrichment of the wadi flash floods indicated by dashed lines fig 6a and 6b evaporation from the water table seawater intrusion mixing with evaporated waters from agricultural or domestic activities and or contribution from salt marshes and lakes along the coastal plains 5 4 moghra aquifer the isotopic composition of groundwater from the moghra aquifer δ2h 1 43 6 57 δ18o 0 14 1 88 is mostly similar to that of the nile waters especially the pre high dam one 0 60 for δ18o 4 30 for δ2h this suggests a contribution from groundwater of the nile delta aquifer fig 7 however the nile water components pre and post high dam could not explain the observed isotopic depletion of some moghra groundwater samples implying a contribution from a depleted isotopic source in the western desert the nubian aquifer groundwaters are under high artesian pressure and suffer from upward leakage through extensive deep seated faults into the overlying shallow aquifers sultan et al 2011 2006 this observation supports the assumption that moghra groundwater represents a mixing between the nile waters and fossil nubian groundwaters as indicated by mixing lines and lower values of slope 3 1 and intercept 1 of the evaporation line fitted to the collected samples fig 7 5 5 carbonate aquifer groundwaters from the carbonate aquifer in sinai is more depleted δ2h 30 50 3 14 δ18o 5 49 0 84 compared to those from the carbonate aquifer in west and east desert fringes of the nile valley δ2h 10 09 16 03 δ18o 2 11 1 95 fig 8 these samples are mostly plotted between the gmwl and emwl and have depleted isotopic compositions comparable to that of modern precipitation rafah and el arish stations fig 8 this could be because sinai groundwaters might represent a mixing between depleted water from the nubian aquifer and modern meteoric water a similar mixed origin is also suggested for the carbonate aquifer at the eastern and western desert fringes of the nile valley fig 8 because rainfall is scarce over the western desert fig 2 the most enriched isotopic composition for west fringe carbonate groundwaters might be related to lateral recharge from adjacent nile valley aquifer fig 8 also shows that groundwater from the eastern carbonate aquifer is more enriched in isotopic composition than the western one this may be due to large contributions from modern precipitation fallen over the red sea hills and draining westward through numerous wadi channels to the nile valley where alluvial and carbonate aquifers are dominant the observed slopes and intercepts for carbonate aquifer in different settings of egypt could therefore reflect different precipitation moisture sources evaporation and or paleowater mixing 5 6 nubian aquifer groundwater samples from the nubian aquifer in the western desert are plotted below the gmwl δ2h 77 07 14 27 δ18o 9 90 2 09 these samples are more depleted in their isotopic compositions compared to those collected from the nubian aquifer in eastern desert δ2h 47 41 10 11 δ18o 7 35 4 76 and sinai δ2h 45 71 12 17 δ18o 6 84 1 42 fig 9 however some of the groundwater samples in the vicinity of east uweinat and lake nasser in southwest egypt are enriched in isotopic composition δ2h 1 85 16 75 δ18o 0 55 1 88 this suggests that enriched water from lake nasser and or modern precipitation over northern sudan contributed to the aquifer through networks of densely fractured and karstified bedrocks local precipitation and floodwater events average modern precipitation from cairo and most groundwater samples from the nubian aquifer in the eastern desert are plotted at and below the gmwl fig 9 most groundwater samples from the nubian aquifer in sinai together with average modern precipitation along the mediterranean sea e g rafah and el arish are plotted between the gmwl and emwl this reflects the different moisture sources of precipitation that contribute to the recharge of the nubian aquifer in the sinai and the eastern desert the contribution from modern precipitation is also indicated from regression lines of nearly same slope to the gmwl fig 9 the outcrops of the nubian aquifer at the foothills of the sinai massif and red sea hills are recharge windows and receive considerable rainfall events e g 76 and 100 mm day recorded for the southern sinai and the eastern desert respectively that mixed with depleted fossil groundwater of the nubian aquifer the mixing process depends mainly on the structural elements that control the connection between these two waters as well as the traveling distance from recharge zones 5 7 fractured basement aquifer the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples collected from the fractured basement aquifers in the eastern desert δ2h 4 97 11 24 δ18o 0 91 2 15 and southern sinai δ2h 20 92 5 79 δ18o 3 96 1 15 are plotted close to the average rainfall isotopic compositions of three rainfall stations in egypt cairo rafah and el arish fig 10 samples collected from the eastern desert had similar isotopic compositions to recent precipitation events e g february 2018 and floodwaters associated with heavy storms e g february 2019 indicating their modern meteoric origin fig 10 the average modern precipitation from cairo recent precipitation event and floodwater and groundwater from basement aquifer in the eastern desert are plotted at and below the gmwl whereas sinai groundwaters together with average modern precipitation from el arish and rafah were plotted between the gmwl and mmwl fig 10 suggesting different moisture sources of precipitation over the basement terrain in southern sinai and the eastern desert the observed deviation from gmwl for eastern desert groundwaters slope 4 7 intercept 0 4 are attributed to varying evaporative isotope enrichment of runoff along wadi channels of the red sea hills in addition more enriched δ18o and δ2h values of up to 5 35 and 22 respectively are related to mixing with the isotopically enriched tailing storage pond waters from sukari gold mining activities in the eastern desert 6 summary and conclusions egypt like any other arid environment is seeking additional freshwater resources to actively mitigate challenges posed by both natural e g climate changes and anthropogenic e g population growth groundwater overexploitation interventions given egypt s limited surface water allocation from the nile river and the expected reduction in this allocation the current egyptian tendency is to increase the use of groundwater resources at the expense of the limited nile river waters governmental agencies and research sectors are trying to develop a sustainable groundwater management scenario for groundwater resources in egypt key to the sustainable use of these resources is understanding their recharge sources and mechanisms collecting field measurements e g geophysical hydrogeological geochemical and constructing and calibrating numerical models e g groundwater flow rainfall runoff provide significant information in this pursuit however the country scale field measurements that are also required for modelling exercise are challenging to collect because the majority of these systems are generally inaccessible there is an urgent need to combine country scale field measurements in a single database that is accessible to researchers decision makers and local communities this database could be used to guide future field data collection this approach will minimize efforts and resources required for field activities and enable researchers to address unprecedented country and aquifer scale science questions in addition the developed approach could also be used to explore the sustainable use scenarios of groundwater resources in these aquifer systems analysis of historical δ2h and δ18o stable isotopic compositions compiled for 1618 water samples collected from the major aquifer systems e g the nile valley and delta alluvial nubian sandstone coastal moghra carbonate and fractured basement and surface water bodies e g the nile river lake nasser floodwater red sea and mediterranean sea in egypt available at https bit ly 3n9mtrm indicate that 1 both alluvial and coastal aquifer systems are recharged from modern rainfall floodwaters and upward leakage from deep aquifer systems these systems could be used in sustainable ways if the extraction rates were reduced to match the modern recharge rates and extraction activities were located near the discharge sources of the deeper systems 2 the nile valley and delta moghra and carbonate systems are receiving recharge from the nile river modern rainfall irrigation canals and drains and upward leakage from deep aquifers groundwater extraction from these systems should be minimized to match the modern recharge rates from rainfall and nile waters and should be located close to the discharge locations of the deeper systems in order to achieve groundwater sustainability in these systems 3 the fractured basement aquifers are recharged by modern rainfall and floodwaters to achieve sustainability extraction from these systems should target areas of higher rainfall rates 4 the nubian aquifer contains mainly fossil water however extraction activities should target regions that receive present day recharge in areas of higher rainfall rates e g foothills of mountainous areas or close to surface water bodies e g lake nasser and nile river 5 future studies should focus on quantifying recharge rates and locations e g iacurto et al 2020 2021 investigating the aquifer scale hydrological parameters that control recharge rates and locations and accurately mapping locations of deep seated fault systems along which deeper aquifers discharge to shallower ones the constructed web application will positively impact the research and local communities as well as decision makers in order to keep this web application up to date additional isotopic data can be added by any researcher as it becomes available researchers just need to download the current database over their area of interest using the available customized web tools in table format then add the dataset see table 1 for the newer sample this practice will significantly reduce time efforts and resources required for collecting additional field measurements that have been already collected this web application will also guide field data collection based on the knowledge of the available resources compilation of all historical isotopic composition data for surface and groundwater samples in egypt will enable improved understanding the country scale stable isotopic compositions of water resources and will enhance understanding of recharge mechanisms across the entire country this practice will enable the scientific community to address unprecedented country and aquifer scale meritorious science questions a similar approach could be applied to host any other dataset e g geophysical hydrogeological geochemical in any location around the globe analysis of the nationwide isotopic data listed on the constructed web application will also raise local community awareness about groundwater sustainability and enhance their practices toward these valuable resources defining the current status of egypt s aquifer systems e g depleted renewable based on their isotopic compositions will guide exploration rates and locations for local communities and decision makers this in turn will significantly enhance the welfare of the local community by empowering them to practice effective efficient and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in their aquifer systems examination of the isotopic data hosted by our web application also improves livelihoods of the egyptian community by providing an accessible and cost effective tool that investigate aquifer sustainability e g fossil versus meteoric systems this tool could be used to reduce stresses on the nile s limited water resources caused by the continuously increasing egyptian population 22 million in 1950 to 100 million in 2020 this web application will help initiate and strengthen collaborative efforts between decision makers local

3428,the advancement of irrigated agriculture is indispensable to satisfy the growing food demands of the world s prospering population it is also essential for accomplishing many un sdgs united nations sustainable development goals such as sdg1 no poverty sdg2 zero hunger and sdg15 life on land without proper management however irrigation advancement can cause twin hydrological problems i e rising aquifer levels and salinization in irrigated areas currently more than a fifth of the total worldwide irrigated region is adversely affected by these problems furthermore whenever left unaddressed these problems could spread to more than half of the irrigated lands worldwide by 2050 to evaluate the aforesaid issues in an irrigated region of india this study first developed a water balance model to assess the long term groundwater recharge which would help to understand the system dynamics of the problems then after analyzing the results a simulation model was set up for the study region considering local agro hydro climatic and soil conditions the approach used is the first of its kind in the selected study region and it will offer a better comprehension of the dynamics of the processes that guide the system imbalances the presented approach is novel and easy to follow and it can also be replicated in other parts of the world dealing with comparative issues the model s performance was evaluated statistically before being applied the models performed very well as evidenced by high r squared values and model efficiency and low me and rmse values the groundwater recharge analysis revealed that the aquifer levels have been rising for the last two decades and they will continue to rise if no preventive measures are implemented the simulated scenarios showed that under the base case alternative the aquifer levels will increase at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m hence apt management plans such as altered cropping pattern conjunctive water use and canal lining are recommended the most favorable scenario divulged that even a little alteration of two to six percent in different inputs would contain the region safe from the problems mentioned above keywords

by 2050 fao 2014 the advancement of irrigated agriculture is necessary to satisfy the aforesaid demands singh 2021a singh 2021b this is mainly imperative in arid and semiarid zones where crop water requirements are largely met by supplemental irrigation due to poorly distributed and erratic rainfall merchán et al 2020 irrigation will stay vital to achieving food security adhikari et al 2017 and

kaushik et al 2019 whitney et al 2018 hammam and mohamed 2020 amanambu et al 2020 these problems are persistent and affect more than thirty three percent of irrigated areas worldwide tian et al 2020

for argentina egypt iran china pakistan and india respectively eishoeei et al 2019 wallender and tanji 2012 wang et al 2020 recently reported that if not addressed these problems could increase to more than half of the irrigated lands worldwide by 2050 the reduction in crop yield owing to these problems are reported in many previous studies from across the world e g mirzaee et al 2020 balkanlou et al 2020 bennett et al 2019 makinde and oyelade 2019 ivushkin et al 2019 and chang et al 2019 etc wang et al 2021 reported a yearly agricultural loss of about 27 billion globally due to these problems a broad range of solutions can be considered to deal with issues related to rising aquifer levels and salinization of agricultural areas nevertheless the feasibility of the relative performance of solutions can t be easily tested with field experiments since recommendations resulting from site explicit field trials can t be employed to a regional level with dissimilar agro hydro climatic conditions in addition issues and prospects related to specific management strategies are generally not perceived for many years until they are well progressed due to their prognostic potential decision support tools such as simulation models are generally used to help make management strategy decisions these models can assist with predicting potential consequences of specific management practices and can help select the most suitable management approaches for the future recently researchers have employed numerous simulation models to address water issues globally e g tirabadi et al 2021 knöll et al 2020 wen et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2020 wu et al 2019 davoodi et al 2019 mao et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 singh 2019 2016 2012 dehghanipour et al 2019 chang et al 2019 heydari et al 2016 bejranonda et al 2013 etc sun et al 2019 proposed a simple model to predict multi year salt balances of an area located in china they integrated a groundwater balance module in the model to get the flow in the root zone the model was employed for 17 years between 1999 and 2016 the result proposed an optimal utilization of groundwater for dealing with the problems of rising aquifer level and salinity recently wen et al 2020 developed a semi distributed model to examine drainage overflow by taking into account the surface and groundwater flow in an irrigated region of china the results showed an improved model presentation in forecasting the drainage effluent and salinity in the region more recently tirabadi et al 2021 proposed a salinity module for swat to simulate natural salinity procedures at watershed scales the proposed module can utilize low quality images to model the salinity of different salts and was successfully used to assess the impacts of climate variability at the watershed scales previously li et al 2016 proposed an approach to examining groundwater surface water linkages and employed it for integrated water resource management in a region of nebraska these models have acquired widespread approval as useful tools to appraise the salinity and water related issues of agricultural areas nonetheless the greater part of these models demands input of soil attributes such as root zone soil moisture osmotic and matric soil water potential and dispersivity which are difficult to quantify they likewise utilize small time steps and need as a minimum a daily data set of hydrologic phenomena considering the past literature analysis identified research gaps and the present necessity as abovementioned the current study utilized a freely available software saltmod oosterbaan 2008 to simulate the long term salt water balances of an irrigated region of india wherein aquifer level has steadily increased as analyzed through the groundwater balance model detailed in the following sections the model was set up for the study region considering local agro hydro climatic and soil conditions recently eishoeei et al 2019 employed saltmod in an area of iran to simulate root zone soil salinity for 10 years considering the impact of drain depth and irrigation strategies the results reported that a drain depth between 5 5 m and 8 5 m and a leaching efficiency of 0 5 produced the best match between observed and modeled parameters the study concluded that saltmod could be successfully used to forecast long term soil salinity by considering the impact of various drain depth and irrigation strategies similarly chang et al 2019 used saltmod in an irrigated part of china to examine diverse management strategies to mitigate long term soil salinization before the simulation the model was effectively calibrated and validated with different datasets of the region the model results showed a minor decline in long term soil salinity in the future 10 year period mao et al 2017 used saltmod to analyze groundwater and salt dynamics for conjunctive use planning in an arid part of china varadarajan and purandara 2017 implemented the application of saltmod for the simulation of potential root zone salinity in an irrigation command of karnataka india considering various drainage options yao et al 2014 applied saltmod for simulating salt water balances of crop s root zone in a coastal agricultural area of inner mongolia daghari and gharbi 2014 utilized saltmod for root zone salinity management in a farming area located in the dyiar al hujjej region of tunisia likewise ferjani et al 2013 employed saltmod for estimating root zone salinity in a part of tunisia bahceci et al 2008 used saltmod for evaluating the impact of controlled drainage on irrigation efficiency and root zone salinity in an irrigated area located in southeastern turkey in virtually every one of the past investigations the saltmod was employed in zones equipped with drainage networks and the aquifer parameters were not reasonably validated and model parameters were not analyzed for their sensitivity in most of the investigations moreover estimates of the error of model performance was not adequately carried out in the majority of the previous studies there are only a few examples of using the model for the long term assessment of water and salt balances even such studies have rarely considered the simulation of all inclusive approaches in dealing with changing aquifer levels and salinization rather they have considered a few options at a time without considering the impact of other ones in addition there is no evidence of long term groundwater recharge assessment as a precursor to saltmod simulation this study investigates the long term impact of diverse management alternatives on groundwater depth and salinities the results of this investigation will offer a better comprehension of the process dynamics that guide the system imbalance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area kalanaur block is situated around 88 km wnw of india s capital new delhi fig 1 administratively the study

cropped area during winter paddy is the second main crop of the block and is grown in about fifty five percent of the cropped area during monsoon other crops grown in the block include sorghum millet pulses sugarcane mustard barley gram and cotton the current crops cultivated in the block are presented in table 1 2 2 data collection and analysis a summary of the data acquired and its sources are presented in table 2 the description and analysis of the acquired information are briefly presented below 2 2 1 canal system the bhalaut sub branch and jawahar lal nehru feeder of the western yamuna canal system are the two main canals which are supplying water in the rohtak district through a network of sub branches distributaries and minors bhiwani sub branch and kalanaur distributary deliver the canal water to kalanaur block kalanaur minor katesrah minor pilana minor and dhurana minor are different parts of the canal systems the water quality in the canals is reasonably good with ec ranging from 0 3 to 0 4 ds m 1 irrigation is largely done by surface flooding canal water distribution is carried out according to the warabandi irrigation system wherein a farmer is permitted to utilize the full flow of water in the watercourse for a certain period which is proportional to the farmer s plot size the flow of water in the canals is registered twice a day by measuring the level irrigation department 2018 cell 2018 2019 michael 2009 2 2 2 groundwater in kalanaur block the groundwater is withdrawn by over 4850 shallow tube wells over eighty percent of them are diesel powered the water tables in the block were measured twice a year i e in june and october the normal groundwater level ranges from a depth of 2 63 m in summer to 1 51 m inmonsoon the ec of groundwater ranges between 1 8 and 5 9 ds m 1 with an average of 3 63 ds m 1 michael 2009 cell 2018 2019 irrigation department 2018 2 2 3 crop water requirement crop water needs were determined according to the approach proposed by the fao allen et al 1998 the reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 was calculated from weather information utilizing hargreaves and samani 1985 as 1 eto 0 0023 r a t avg 17 8 t max t min where tmin is minimum air temperature c tmax is maximum air temperature c tavg is mean air temperature c and ra is extraterrestrial solar radiation mm d 1 the eto values and crop coefficients kc tyagi et al 2000 allen et al 1998 were used to compute the potential crop evapotranspiration etc as 2 etc e t o k c 2 2 4 irrigation requirement the fao method was utilized to compute the seasonal effective rainfall ref dastane 1978 this method computes ref by utilizing daily rainfall r as ref 0 7 r t for non paddy crops ref 0 8 r t for paddy the net irrigation requirement in of each crop in both the seasons t was computed as eq 5 5 in e t c r e f the gross irrigation requirement i of each crop was computed by considering the irrigation efficiency η which is based on the information available for similar soil and agro hydro climatic conditions e g irrigation department 2018 michael 2009 2 2 5 canal seepage seepage from canals generally relies upon channel length water depth canal lining and canal running days seasonal seepage from canals was calculated using eq 6 irrigation department 2018 singh et al 2019 as follows g c l c s f w p c n d 86400 where lc is the length of canal m sf is the seepage factor for the canal wpc is the wetted perimeter of the canal during the run m nd is the number of days of the canal operation in the season day and gc is groundwater recharge caused by canal seepage m3 based on the soil and geologic parameters of the block region the seepage factor was suggested to be 2 5 3 0 and 0 62 0 75 m3 s 1 mm 2 of wetted area for unlined and lined channels respectively irrigation department 2018 2 2 6 field percolation the irrigated field s recharge was computed following recommendations from the groundwater estimation committee 1984 deep percolation in agricultural fields was primarily based on studies done in similar areas for various crops this study computed agricultural field s groundwater recharge as given in eq 7 gp d a d f where gp is groundwater recharge because of field percolation m3 d is irrigation depth m a is the crop area m2 and df is the portion of used water added as groundwater recharge 2 2 7 rainfall recharge based on agro hydro climatic and soil characteristics of the region this study considered that twenty percent of all rainfall contributes to aquifer recharge singh et al 2019 2 2 8 tubewell draft the recommendations given by the groundwater cell 2018 and groundwater estimation committee 1984 were considered to compute the seasonal tubewell withdrawal the average flow rate of a shallow tubewell in the study region was reported at 0 006 0 012 m3 s 1 3 assessment of the problem long term groundwater recharge estimation is vital for examining the rising aquifer level and salinization issues in the study region it is also required for sustainable groundwater management and better understanding the system dynamics of the issues different methods are available for groundwater recharge estimation korbel and hose 2017 normally groundwater recharge estimation methods are categorized primarily based on data availability and suitability of the technique under given agro hydro climatic conditions scanlon et al 2002 considering this the current investigation formulates a simple groundwater balance model which is a combination of groundwater budget and seasonal groundwater level variations the model uses input parameters that are readily available or precisely computed the accounting of water gain and loss per unit time in the block area can be given as 8 q i n q o u t i r g p g c q w e t c s r δ s where qin is the lateral inflow to the area m3 qout is the lateral outflow from the area m3 i is irrigation m3 r is rainfall m3 gp is field percolation m3 gc is canal seepage m3 qw is draft from wells m3 etc is crop evapotranspiration m3 sr is surface runoff m3 and δs is the change in groundwater storage analyzed as net groundwater recharge m3 the values qout qin and sr to and from the block area are considered negligible for regional investigations hassan and bhutta 1996 thus eq 8 can be written as 9 δ s i r gp gc qw etc the groundwater level variation method was utilized to compute the mean groundwater level of a season as 10 δ h δ s a sy where δh is the mean aquifer depth a is the study area and sy is the average specific yield of the unconfined aquifer the sy value was established by analyzing the time drawdown information from pumping tests cell 2018 2019 eqs 9 and 10 can be simplified as eq 11 11 δ h i r gp gc qw etc a sy the seasonal δh values are calculated with eq 11 for the entire study period 1997 2019 the model performance was evaluated statistically as described in the succeeding sections the calculated seasonal groundwater recharges were utilized for the appraisal of the existing groundwater level situation in the block area it will form the basis for the simulation of future scenarios through a simulation model as described below 4 simulation modeling 4 1 simulation model description a freely available program saltmod was set up for the study area considering local agro hydro climatic and soil conditions saltmod predicts and simulates soil salinity aquifer depth and drain flow in irrigated regions considering diverse climatic conditions crop rotations and different water management alternatives oosterbaan 2008 the model allows the user to divide a year between one and four seasons this study considers two seasons in a year as described in the preceding sections the model requires as inputs the seasonal components of the water balance which are identified with surface and groundwater hydrology these include four specific reservoirs surface reservoir root zone transition zone and aquifer the farmers response to salinization and aquifer elevation can also be included in the model saltmod program its principles user s manual and literature related to its applications can be accessed at www waterlog info in this work the saltmod model is separate from the groundwater recharge model described in the preceding section the recharge model was used to quantify the relative contributions of different components of the water balance to establish groundwater levels in the block area using these results saltmod was used to simulate future scenarios to investigate methods of managing irrigation induced salinization and rising groundwater levels 4 2 calibration and validation the model must be calibrated and validated before it can be used to examine the long term effects of different water management alternatives on aquifer depth and salinity in calibration model inputs are altered to achieve the most ideal match between the observed and modeled variables model calibration was performed for eleven years from october 1997 to june 2008 and then validated with the observed system variables for subsequent eleven years from october 2008 to june 2019 a standard process described by sorooshian and gupta 1995 was utilized for calibration the water and salt balance components needed for the model are presented in table 3 in the block most of these parameters were either acquired from the sources mentioned in table 2 or estimated values of some less sensitive model parameters such as total porosity and leaching efficiency in the transition zone and root zone etc were assumed table 3 a few parameters like effective porosity peq and leaching efficiency flq could not be estimated before applying the model these variables were established by trial and error during calibration the peq and flq values chosen were those that gave the aquifer depth and salinity that matched the values observed and were physically reasonable as well 4 3 sensitivity analysis because of the uncertainty in assessing the aquifer variables sensitivity analysis is essential for modeling studies it is especially vital when numerous variables must be optimized throughout the model run during model calibration it was observed that a few variables are sensitive to aquifer elements while others have no significant impact on the outcomes in this investigation sensitivity analysis was performed for the most sensitive model parameters including peq and flq a fifty percent change in the calibrated values was considered to appraise sensitivity ting et al 1998 4 4 statistical error analysis statistical error analysis can be done to evaluate the impact of variations between modeled and measured values of aquifer variables on model results the mean error me root mean square error rmse and model efficiency ef were utilized to assess model performance 12 me 1 n i 1 n mi pi 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n mi pi 2 14 ef i 1 n mi m 2 i 1 n mi p i 2 i 1 n mi m 2 where n is total number of observations pi and mi are predicted and measured state variables and m is average of measured state variables besides the consistency of the model outputs is evaluated by a graphical representation of the predicted and measured parameters 4 5 simulation of management alternatives after saltmod was successfully calibrated and validated it was utilized to explore different management options for the block prognostic modeling was conducted to investigate the long term 14 years from 2019 to 2033 effects of various management options on salinity and aquifer depth various combinations of surface and groundwater utilization for irrigation and various hydrologic situations were included in the scenarios the investigation considers six management alternatives that are rational given the current agro hydrological environments and established socioeconomic norms the management alternatives were formulated by making at least one alteration in the baseline conditions of various input parameters the scenarios considered can be proposed to farmers for direct implementation on their fields the six water management scenarios considered in this investigation are detailed below 4 5 1 scenario 1 base case this scenario corresponds to aquifer level and salinity conditions over the next fourteen years to 2033 while maintaining the existing crop pattern recharge discharge irrigation practices and agro hydrologic conditions as aforementioned 4 5 2 scenario 2 canal lining the study block has widespread canal networks which irrigate over sixty percent of the total irrigated area most of the canals are unlined contributing significantly to the groundwater thanks to intense seepage losses irrigation department 2018 a great volume of water can be saved by the lining of canals as the unlined canals seep 300 more than lined canals irrigation department 2018 this scenario deals with the impacts from a decrease in seepage from the lining the entire canal network resulting in an average seepage factor value of 0 65 irrigation department 2018 4 5 3 scenario 3 conjunctive water use the quality of groundwater in the study block is poor as aforementioned the direct use of poor quality groundwater can harm plant and soil health due to salt accrual in the root zone conjunctive use can allow for the use of groundwater in combination with good quality canal water this alternative explores the impacts of escalating groundwater volume through either augmented pumping from the current tubewells or installing additional ones in this scenario a six percent increase in tubewell withdrawal is simulated to establish its effect on aquifer levels in the next 14 years 4 5 4 scenario 4 altered cropping pattern the existing seasonal cropping pattern shows that about fifty five percent of the cultivated area in the monsoon season is covered by paddy crop nonetheless the contribution of the paddy area in whole field percolation is over eighty six percent fig 5 therefore it appears that continually increasing paddy area is not sustainable to the hydro geological and topographical situations of the region this scenario simulates the reduction of paddy area against other crops in the monsoon season since this could noticeably lessen percolation losses a reduction of twelve percent in paddy area is considered in this scenario 4 5 5 scenario 5 dry conditions in the study area precipitation events are rather erratic both in time and space thus a few years of drought is possible this alternative will simulate the water and salt balances of the aquifer in the following 14 years when long dry spells happen successively the third fourth fifth eighth ninth twelfth and thirteenth years are regarded as dry in this scenario based on historical data about drought frequency a year is considered dry if the annual rainfall is 20 deficient from the long term average michael 2009 4 5 6 scenario 6 combined alternatives the ultimate aim of any alternative in this study is to keep the aquifer depth at a level that is neither too deep nor too shallow avoiding both groundwater overexploitation and root zone salinization in this alternative various combinations of management options are tested by trial and error sorooshian and gupta 1995 to establish the most favorable for example increased decreased groundwater canal water use and or decreased paddy area so that the aquifer level could be stabilized between 2 5 and 3 m below the soil surface during the prediction period 5 results and discussion 5 1 groundwater recharge analysis results of the groundwater recharge model are depicted in fig 3 it shows a close match between the calculated and measured values of groundwater depths linear regression and a 1 1 plot between the two datasets are depicted in fig 4 which can confidently be considered a good agreement between the two data sets as evidenced by the high r squared value of 0 9728 this is also confirmed by the statistically low values of rmse 0 2516 m and me 0 0526 m and the high value of ef 0 91 it can be concluded from fig 3 and fig 4 and the statistical evaluation that the model worked very well in estimating groundwater depths during the study period the groundwater recharge components for the monsoon season are presented in fig 5 a it can be seen that more than sixty two percent of the average seasonal total recharge field percolation is contributed during this period paddy areas contributed to more than 86 of total field percolation of the average percolation of 54 5 mm3 46 9 mm3 was from paddy areas the contributions from canal seepage and rainfall were sixteen and twenty two percent respectively the corresponding recharge contributions from field percolation canal seepage and rainfall in the winter were twenty five forty eight and twenty seven percent as presented in fig 5b analysis of the groundwater balance reveals that the block gets a normal net recharge of 47 1 mm3 during the monsoon increasing groundwater depth by an average of 1 20 m in contrast a negative average net recharge of 42 6 mm3 during the winter reduces the depth by an average of 1 09 m resulting in an average aquifer level rise of 0 11 m per year as discussed above the groundwater level in the block is rising at a steady rate and additional rise would worsen conditions it is necessary to develop and implement alternative management plans to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the block 5 2 calibration and validation results fig 6 shows the predicted and measured groundwater depth information for the saltmod calibration and validation calval the model predicted values closely matching the measured ones throughout the simulation nearly parallel results can be seen with the groundwater salinities results throughout the model calval as shown in fig 7 the information obtained through the calibration and validation periods was statistically evaluated rmse and me were also realistically low throughout calval as presented in table 4 ef values were reasonably high at 0 89 and 0 88 throughout calval with groundwater depth table 4 the parallel values were 0 87 and 0 85 for the groundwater salinities therefore it can be concluded from fig 6 fig 7 and table 4 that saltmod worked very well in foreseeing the groundwater depths and salinities in the block 5 3 results of sensitivity analysis fig 8 shows the sensitivity analysis results for groundwater levels and salinities data the results indicate that the effective porosity of the aquifer peq induces significant changes to the depth and salinity of the groundwater while soil leaching efficiency flq induces changes only to groundwater salinity and does not affect groundwater depth when peq was increased greater groundwater depth and lower salinity were found an increased peq value results in a groundwater level at 2 12 mbgs at the end of the simulation period which is 0 27 m deeper than the normal conditions while a decrease in value would result in an aquifer level at 1 62 mbgs which is 0 23 m shallower fig 8 the groundwater salinity results were 5 39 and 5 69 ds m with an increase and decrease in peq values against the normal value of 5 54 ds m as shown in fig 8 the corresponding salinity values were 5 22 and 5 86 ds m with an increase and decrease in flq values 5 4 assessment of simulated alternatives 5 4 1 scenario 1 base case results attained for the base case scenario show and steady rise in groundwater depth throughout the 2019 2033 modeling period fig 9 this is evident from the outcomes which show that groundwater depth will reach 0 69 mbgs in 2033 compared to the current 1 81 m therefore the groundwater level in the base case would go up at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m with an overall increase of 1 12 m in the next fourteen years furthermore in the base case the groundwater level will reach the root zone in the eleventh year in addition the salinity of the aquifer will increase to 6 39 ds m compared to the current value of 5 56 ds m as anticipated the steady decrease in the depth of the groundwater level is alarming and requires urgent intervention for the long term sustainability of agricultural production in the block 5 4 2 scenario 2 canal lining the results of the impact of channel lining on the overall water and salt balances of the study block over the next fourteen years are shown in fig 9 it can be observed from the results that complete canal lining can bring the groundwater to a depth of 2 79 mbgs compared to the current level of 1 81 mbgs under this scenario the groundwater level would decline at average yearly pace of 0 07 m versus rising 0 08 m under the base case scenario scenario 1 thus the total canal lining alone keeps the groundwater level at reasonable depth at the end of the modeling period groundwater salinity is predicted to drop to 4 97 ds m under this scenario versus the current level of 5 56 ds m a great volume of water can be saved by the lined canals as the unlined canals seep three hundred percent more than lined canals as aforementioned irrigation department 2018 the canals lining however requires huge capital investment 5 4 3 scenario 3 conjunctive water use the outcomes of this scenario demonstrate a steady and constant decline in groundwater depth during the prediction period fig 9 groundwater depth will decrease at a rate of 0 05 m per year and reach a level of 2 54 mbgs versus an initial level of 1 81 mbgs thus in this alternative the depth of groundwater will increase by 0 73 m in the fourteen year prediction period the groundwater salinity is predicted decline to a level of 5 12 ds m model results indicate that in this alternative the depth of groundwater would not get to the root zone all through the prediction period hence the conjunctive utilization of groundwater in combination with good quality canal water could keep the groundwater depth at a safe level as it is a requirement for long term agricultural sustainability 5 4 4 scenario 4 altered cropping pattern in this alternative sorghum is cultivated in twelve percent of the areas presently utilized to grow paddy as the water demand of the former is much lower the results of this alternative fig 9 show that the groundwater depth is predicted to decrease to 2 41 mbgs toward the end of the prediction period representing a yearly groundwater depth decline of 0 04 m versus a rise of 0 08 m in the base case groundwater salinity is predicted to decrease to 5 21 ds m so it appears that continually increasing paddy area is not sustainable to the block s hydro geological and topographical situations therefore part of the existing paddy area should be replaced by some low water requiring crops such as sorghum 5 4 5 scenario 5 dry conditions in the study area rainfall situations are rather erratic both in time and space thus a few years of intermittent drought can be more likely than continuous ones this alternative simulates the water salt balances of the block area during the fourteen years prediction period with irregular spells of dry years in this alternative there is an irregular decrease in the groundwater table during dry years fig 9 by the end of the simulation the groundwater depth is predicted to decrease by only 0 40 m at a mean yearly rate of 0 03 m the depth of groundwater is predicted remain at 2 21 mbgs and groundwater salinity is predicted to reduce to 5 33 ds m the decrease of groundwater depth in this alternative is explained by low net groundwater recharge in dry years 5 4 6 scenario 6 combined alternatives the implications of this alternative demonstrate that groundwater depth could reach 2 mbgs after the fourth year and 2 5 mbgs after the seventh year of simulation fig 9 remaining between 2 5 mbgs and 3 mbgs between the seventh and fourteenth year of simulation in this alternative the groundwater depth is predicted to decrease by 1 05 m in the entire prediction period at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m groundwater salinity under these conditions are predicted to lower to 4 81 ds m these reasonably favorable situations of water salt balances can be accomplished by changing the canal supply by 16 paddy cultivation by by 10 and tubewell withdrawal by 4 for the second fifth sixth and seventh years of the prediction and from the ninth year changing canal supply by 7 paddy cultivation by 6 and tubewell withdrawal by 2 thus it could be concluded that small changes of just 2 to 6 percent in different inputs could maintain the area from the abovementioned problems 6 conclusions and recommendations based on various measures of statistical analysis such as high r squared and model efficiency low rmse and me values it can be concluded that both models perform very well for the study block groundwater recharge model results show that the aquifer level in the region has been rising at a mean yearly rate of over 0 11 m for the past two decades and it will continue to rise unless preventive measures are taken because of higher net groundwater recharge in the monsoon season since the groundwater level is already high an additional rise would worsen the conditions it is necessary to develop and implement alternative management plans to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the block area as a follow up action a simulation model saltmod investigated the long term impact of diverse management alternatives on aquifer depth and salinity the management alternatives were formulated by making at least one alteration in the baseline conditions of various input parameters the simulated scenarios showed that under the base case alternative the aquifer levels would rise at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m the most favorable scenario indicated that even a small alteration of two to six percent in different inputs would reduce the risks in this region hence apt management plans such as altered cropping patterns conjunctive water use and canal lining are recommended for future implementation some of the suggested recommendations would require socioeconomic and policy intervention credit authorship contribution statement ajay singh conceptualization

3428,the advancement of irrigated agriculture is indispensable to satisfy the growing food demands of the world s prospering population it is also essential for accomplishing many un sdgs united nations sustainable development goals such as sdg1 no poverty sdg2 zero hunger and sdg15 life on land without proper management however irrigation advancement can cause twin hydrological problems i e rising aquifer levels and salinization in irrigated areas currently more than a fifth of the total worldwide irrigated region is adversely affected by these problems furthermore whenever left unaddressed these problems could spread to more than half of the irrigated lands worldwide by 2050 to evaluate the aforesaid issues in an irrigated region of india this study first developed a water balance model to assess the long term groundwater recharge which would help to understand the system dynamics of the problems then after analyzing the results a simulation model was set up for the study region considering local agro hydro climatic and soil conditions the approach used is the first of its kind in the selected study region and it will offer a better comprehension of the dynamics of the processes that guide the system imbalances the presented approach is novel and easy to follow and it can also be replicated in other parts of the world dealing with comparative issues the model s performance was evaluated statistically before being applied the models performed very well as evidenced by high r squared values and model efficiency and low me and rmse values the groundwater recharge analysis revealed that the aquifer levels have been rising for the last two decades and they will continue to rise if no preventive measures are implemented the simulated scenarios showed that under the base case alternative the aquifer levels will increase at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m hence apt management plans such as altered cropping pattern conjunctive water use and canal lining are recommended the most favorable scenario divulged that even a little alteration of two to six percent in different inputs would contain the region safe from the problems mentioned above keywords

kaushik et al 2019 whitney et al 2018 hammam and mohamed 2020 amanambu et al 2020 these problems are persistent and affect more than thirty three percent of irrigated areas worldwide tian et al 2020

for argentina egypt iran china pakistan and india respectively eishoeei et al 2019 wallender and tanji 2012 wang et al 2020 recently reported that if not addressed these problems could increase to more than half of the irrigated lands worldwide by 2050 the reduction in crop yield owing to these problems are reported in many previous studies from across the world e g mirzaee et al 2020 balkanlou et al 2020 bennett et al 2019 makinde and oyelade 2019 ivushkin et al 2019 and chang et al 2019 etc wang et al 2021 reported a yearly agricultural loss of about 27 billion globally due to these problems a broad range of solutions can be considered to deal with issues related to rising aquifer levels and salinization of agricultural areas nevertheless the feasibility of the relative performance of solutions can t be easily tested with field experiments since recommendations resulting from site explicit field trials can t be employed to a regional level with dissimilar agro hydro climatic conditions in addition issues and prospects related to specific management strategies are generally not perceived for many years until they are well progressed due to their prognostic potential decision support tools such as simulation models are generally used to help make management strategy decisions these models can assist with predicting potential consequences of specific management practices and can help select the most suitable management approaches for the future recently researchers have employed numerous simulation models to address water issues globally e g tirabadi et al 2021 knöll et al 2020 wen et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2020 wu et al 2019 davoodi et al 2019 mao et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 singh 2019 2016 2012 dehghanipour et al 2019 chang et al 2019 heydari et al 2016 bejranonda et al 2013 etc sun et al 2019 proposed a simple model to predict multi year salt balances of an area located in china they integrated a groundwater balance module in the model to get the flow in the root zone the model was employed for 17 years between 1999 and 2016 the result proposed an optimal utilization of groundwater for dealing with the problems of rising aquifer level and salinity recently wen et al 2020 developed a semi distributed model to examine drainage overflow by taking into account the surface and groundwater flow in an irrigated region of china the results showed an improved model presentation in forecasting the drainage effluent and salinity in the region more recently tirabadi et al 2021 proposed a salinity module for swat to simulate natural salinity procedures at watershed scales the proposed module can utilize low quality images to model the salinity of different salts and was successfully used to assess the impacts of climate variability at the watershed scales previously li et al 2016 proposed an approach to examining groundwater surface water linkages and employed it for integrated water resource management in a region of nebraska these models have acquired widespread approval as useful tools to appraise the salinity and water related issues of agricultural areas nonetheless the greater part of these models demands input of soil attributes such as root zone soil moisture osmotic and matric soil water potential and dispersivity which are difficult to quantify they likewise utilize small time steps and need as a minimum a daily data set of hydrologic phenomena considering the past literature analysis identified research gaps and the present necessity as abovementioned the current study utilized a freely available software saltmod oosterbaan 2008 to simulate the long term salt water balances of an irrigated region of india wherein aquifer level has steadily increased as analyzed through the groundwater balance model detailed in the following sections the model was set up for the study region considering local agro hydro climatic and soil conditions recently eishoeei et al 2019 employed saltmod in an area of iran to simulate root zone soil salinity for 10 years considering the impact of drain depth and irrigation strategies the results reported that a drain depth between 5 5 m and 8 5 m and a leaching efficiency of 0 5 produced the best match between observed and modeled parameters the study concluded that saltmod could be successfully used to forecast long term soil salinity by considering the impact of various drain depth and irrigation strategies similarly chang et al 2019 used saltmod in an irrigated part of china to examine diverse management strategies to mitigate long term soil salinization before the simulation the model was effectively calibrated and validated with different datasets of the region the model results showed a minor decline in long term soil salinity in the future 10 year period mao et al 2017 used saltmod to analyze groundwater and salt dynamics for conjunctive use planning in an arid part of china varadarajan and purandara 2017 implemented the application of saltmod for the simulation of potential root zone salinity in an irrigation command of karnataka india considering various drainage options yao et al 2014 applied saltmod for simulating salt water balances of crop s root zone in a coastal agricultural area of inner mongolia daghari and gharbi 2014 utilized saltmod for root zone salinity management in a farming area located in the dyiar al hujjej region of tunisia likewise ferjani et al 2013 employed saltmod for estimating root zone salinity in a part of tunisia bahceci et al 2008 used saltmod for evaluating the impact of controlled drainage on irrigation efficiency and root zone salinity in an irrigated area located in southeastern turkey in virtually every one of the past investigations the saltmod was employed in zones equipped with drainage networks and the aquifer parameters were not reasonably validated and model parameters were not analyzed for their sensitivity in most of the investigations moreover estimates of the error of model performance was not adequately carried out in the majority of the previous studies there are only a few examples of using the model for the long term assessment of water and salt balances even such studies have rarely considered the simulation of all inclusive approaches in dealing with changing aquifer levels and salinization rather they have considered a few options at a time without considering the impact of other ones in addition there is no evidence of long term groundwater recharge assessment as a precursor to saltmod simulation this study investigates the long term impact of diverse management alternatives on groundwater depth and salinities the results of this investigation will offer a better comprehension of the process dynamics that guide the system imbalance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area kalanaur block is situated around 88 km wnw of india s capital new delhi fig 1 administratively the study area is situated in rohtak district of haryana state in india and is between 28 40 58 n to 28 54 19 n latitude and 76 20 16 e to 76 34 38 e longitude covering an area of 29 277 ha climatic conditions

cropped area during winter paddy is the second main crop of the block and is grown in about fifty five percent of the cropped area during monsoon other crops grown in the block include sorghum millet pulses sugarcane mustard barley gram and cotton the current crops cultivated in the block are presented in table 1 2 2 data collection and analysis a summary of the data acquired and its sources are presented in table 2 the description and analysis of the acquired information are briefly presented below 2 2 1 canal system the bhalaut sub branch and jawahar lal nehru feeder of the western yamuna canal system are the two main canals which are supplying water in the rohtak district through a network of sub branches distributaries and minors bhiwani sub branch and kalanaur distributary deliver the canal water to kalanaur block kalanaur minor katesrah minor pilana minor and dhurana minor are different parts of the canal systems the water quality in the canals is reasonably good with ec ranging from 0 3 to 0 4 ds m 1 irrigation is largely done by surface flooding canal water distribution is carried out according to the warabandi irrigation system wherein a farmer is permitted to utilize the full flow of water in the watercourse for a certain period which is proportional to the farmer s plot size the flow of water in the canals is registered twice a day by measuring the level irrigation department 2018 cell 2018 2019 michael 2009 2 2 2 groundwater in kalanaur block the groundwater is withdrawn by over 4850 shallow tube wells over eighty percent of them are diesel powered the water tables in the block were measured twice a year i e in june and october the normal groundwater level ranges from a depth of 2 63 m in summer to 1 51 m inmonsoon the ec of groundwater ranges between 1 8 and 5 9 ds m 1 with an average of 3 63 ds m 1 michael 2009 cell 2018 2019 irrigation department 2018 2 2 3 crop water requirement crop water needs were determined according to the approach proposed by the fao allen et al 1998 the reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 was calculated from weather information utilizing hargreaves and samani 1985 as 1 eto 0 0023 r a t avg 17 8 t max t min where tmin is minimum air temperature c tmax is maximum air temperature c tavg is mean air temperature c and ra is extraterrestrial solar radiation mm d 1 the eto values and crop coefficients kc tyagi et al 2000 allen et al 1998 were used to compute the potential crop evapotranspiration etc as 2 etc e t o k c 2 2 4 irrigation requirement the fao method was utilized to compute the seasonal effective rainfall ref dastane 1978 this method computes ref by utilizing daily rainfall r as ref 0 7 r t for non paddy crops ref 0 8 r t for paddy the net irrigation requirement in of each crop in both the seasons t was computed as eq 5 5 in e t c r e f the gross irrigation requirement i of each crop was computed by considering the irrigation efficiency η which is based on the information available for similar soil and agro hydro climatic conditions e g irrigation department 2018 michael 2009 2 2 5 canal seepage seepage from canals generally relies upon channel length water depth canal lining and canal running days seasonal seepage from canals was calculated using eq 6 irrigation department 2018 singh et al 2019 as follows g c l c s f w p c n d 86400 where lc is the length of canal m sf is the seepage factor for the canal wpc is the wetted perimeter of the canal during the run m nd is the number of days of the canal operation in the season day and gc is groundwater recharge caused by canal seepage m3 based on the soil and geologic parameters of the block region the seepage factor was suggested to be 2 5 3 0 and 0 62 0 75 m3 s 1 mm 2 of wetted area for unlined and lined channels respectively irrigation department 2018 2 2 6 field percolation the irrigated field s recharge was computed following recommendations from the groundwater estimation committee 1984 deep percolation in agricultural fields was primarily based on studies done in similar areas for various crops this study computed agricultural field s groundwater recharge as given in eq 7 gp d a d f where gp is groundwater recharge because of field percolation m3 d is irrigation depth m a is the crop area m2 and df is the portion of used water added as groundwater recharge 2 2 7 rainfall recharge based on agro hydro climatic and soil characteristics of the region this study considered that twenty percent of all rainfall contributes to aquifer recharge singh et al 2019 2 2 8 tubewell draft the recommendations given by the groundwater cell 2018 and groundwater estimation committee 1984 were considered to compute the seasonal tubewell withdrawal the average flow rate of a shallow tubewell in the study region was reported at 0 006 0 012 m3 s 1 3 assessment of the problem long term groundwater recharge estimation is vital for examining the rising aquifer level and salinization issues in the study region it is also required for sustainable groundwater management and better understanding the system dynamics of the issues different methods are available for groundwater recharge estimation korbel and hose 2017 normally groundwater recharge estimation methods are categorized primarily based on data availability and suitability of the technique under given agro hydro climatic conditions scanlon et al 2002 considering this the current investigation formulates a simple groundwater balance model which is a combination of groundwater budget and seasonal groundwater level variations the model uses input parameters that are readily available or precisely computed the accounting of water gain and loss per unit time in the block area can be given as 8 q i n q o u t i r g p g c q w e t c s r δ s where qin is the lateral inflow to the area m3 qout is the lateral outflow from the area m3 i is irrigation m3 r is rainfall m3 gp is field percolation m3 gc is canal seepage m3 qw is draft from wells m3 etc is crop evapotranspiration m3 sr is surface runoff m3 and δs is the change in groundwater storage analyzed as net groundwater recharge m3 the values qout qin and sr to and from the block area are considered negligible for regional investigations hassan and bhutta 1996 thus eq 8 can be written as 9 δ s i r gp gc qw etc the groundwater level variation method was utilized to compute the mean groundwater level of a season as 10 δ h δ s a sy where δh is the mean aquifer depth a is the study area and sy is the average specific yield of the unconfined aquifer the sy value was established by analyzing the time drawdown information from pumping tests cell 2018 2019 eqs 9 and 10 can be simplified as eq 11 11 δ h i r gp gc qw etc a sy the seasonal δh values are calculated with eq 11 for the entire study period 1997 2019 the model performance was evaluated statistically as described in the succeeding sections the calculated seasonal groundwater recharges were utilized for the appraisal of the existing groundwater level situation in the block area it will form the basis for the simulation of future scenarios through a simulation model as described below 4 simulation modeling 4 1 simulation model description a freely available program saltmod was set up for the study area considering local agro hydro climatic and soil conditions saltmod predicts and simulates soil salinity aquifer depth and drain flow in irrigated regions considering diverse climatic conditions crop rotations and different water management alternatives oosterbaan 2008 the model allows the user to divide a year between one and four seasons this study considers two seasons in a year as described in the preceding sections the model requires as inputs the seasonal components of the water balance which are identified with surface and groundwater hydrology these include four specific reservoirs surface reservoir root zone transition zone and aquifer the farmers response to salinization and aquifer elevation can also be included in the model saltmod program its principles user s manual and literature related to its applications can be accessed at www waterlog info in this work the saltmod model is separate from the groundwater recharge model described in the preceding section the recharge model was used to quantify the relative contributions of different components of the water balance to establish groundwater levels in the block area using these results saltmod was used to simulate future scenarios to investigate methods of managing irrigation induced salinization and rising groundwater levels 4 2 calibration and validation the model must be calibrated and validated before it can be used to examine the long term effects of different water management alternatives on aquifer depth and salinity in calibration model inputs are altered to achieve the most ideal match between the observed and modeled variables model calibration was performed for eleven years from october 1997 to june 2008 and then validated with the observed system variables for subsequent eleven years from october 2008 to june 2019 a standard process described by sorooshian and gupta 1995 was utilized for calibration the water and salt balance components needed for the model are presented in table 3 in the block most of these parameters were either acquired from the sources mentioned in table 2 or estimated values of some less sensitive model parameters such as total porosity and leaching efficiency in the transition zone and root zone etc were assumed table 3 a few parameters like effective porosity peq and leaching efficiency flq could not be estimated before applying the model these variables were established by trial and error during calibration the peq and flq values chosen were those that gave the aquifer depth and salinity that matched the values observed and were physically reasonable as well 4 3 sensitivity analysis because of the uncertainty in assessing the aquifer variables sensitivity analysis is essential for modeling studies it is especially vital when numerous variables must be optimized throughout the model run during model calibration it was observed that a few variables are sensitive to aquifer elements while others have no significant impact on the outcomes in this investigation sensitivity analysis was performed for the most sensitive model parameters including peq and flq a fifty percent change in the calibrated values was considered to appraise sensitivity ting et al 1998 4 4 statistical error analysis statistical error analysis can be done to evaluate the impact of variations between modeled and measured values of aquifer variables on model results the mean error me root mean square error rmse and model efficiency ef were utilized to assess model performance 12 me 1 n i 1 n mi pi 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n mi pi 2 14 ef i 1 n mi m 2 i 1 n mi p i 2 i 1 n mi m 2 where n is total number of observations pi and mi are predicted and measured state variables and m is average of measured state variables besides the consistency of the model outputs is evaluated by a graphical representation of the predicted and measured parameters 4 5 simulation of management alternatives after saltmod was successfully calibrated and validated it was utilized to explore different management options for the block prognostic modeling was conducted to investigate the long term 14 years from 2019 to 2033 effects of various management options on salinity and aquifer depth various combinations of surface and groundwater utilization for irrigation and various hydrologic situations were included in the scenarios the investigation considers six management alternatives that are rational given the current agro hydrological environments and established socioeconomic norms the management alternatives were formulated by making at least one alteration in the baseline conditions of various input parameters the scenarios considered can be proposed to farmers for direct implementation on their fields the six water management scenarios considered in this investigation are detailed below 4 5 1 scenario 1 base case this scenario corresponds to aquifer level and salinity conditions over the next fourteen years to 2033 while maintaining the existing crop pattern recharge discharge irrigation practices and agro hydrologic conditions as aforementioned 4 5 2 scenario 2 canal lining the study block has widespread canal networks which irrigate over sixty percent of the total irrigated area most of the canals are unlined contributing significantly to the groundwater thanks to intense seepage losses irrigation department 2018 a great volume of water can be saved by the lining of canals as the unlined canals seep 300 more than lined canals irrigation department 2018 this scenario deals with the impacts from a decrease in seepage from the lining the entire canal network resulting in an average seepage factor value of 0 65 irrigation department 2018 4 5 3 scenario 3 conjunctive water use the quality of groundwater in the study block is poor as aforementioned the direct use of poor quality groundwater can harm plant and soil health due to salt accrual in the root zone conjunctive use can allow for the use of groundwater in combination with good quality canal water this alternative explores the impacts of escalating groundwater volume through either augmented pumping from the current tubewells or installing additional ones in this scenario a six percent increase in tubewell withdrawal is simulated to establish its effect on aquifer levels in the next 14 years 4 5 4 scenario 4 altered cropping pattern the existing seasonal cropping pattern shows that about fifty five percent of the cultivated area in the monsoon season is covered by paddy crop nonetheless the contribution of the paddy area in whole field percolation is over eighty six percent fig 5 therefore it appears that continually increasing paddy area is not sustainable to the hydro geological and topographical situations of the region this scenario simulates the reduction of paddy area against other crops in the monsoon season since this could noticeably lessen percolation losses a reduction of twelve percent in paddy area is considered in this scenario 4 5 5 scenario 5 dry conditions in the study area precipitation events are rather erratic both in time and space thus a few years of drought is possible this alternative will simulate the water and salt balances of the aquifer in the following 14 years when long dry spells happen successively the third fourth fifth eighth ninth twelfth and thirteenth years are regarded as dry in this scenario based on historical data about drought frequency a year is considered dry if the annual rainfall is 20 deficient from the long term average michael 2009 4 5 6 scenario 6 combined alternatives the ultimate aim of any alternative in this study is to keep the aquifer depth at a level that is neither too deep nor too shallow avoiding both groundwater overexploitation and root zone salinization in this alternative various combinations of management options are tested by trial and error sorooshian and gupta 1995 to establish the most favorable for example increased decreased groundwater canal water use and or decreased paddy area so that the aquifer level could be stabilized between 2 5 and 3 m below the soil surface during the prediction period 5 results and discussion 5 1 groundwater recharge analysis results of the groundwater recharge model are depicted in fig 3 it shows a close match between the calculated and measured values of groundwater depths linear regression and a 1 1 plot between the two datasets are depicted in fig 4 which can confidently be considered a good agreement between the two data sets as evidenced by the high r squared value of 0 9728 this is also confirmed by the statistically low values of rmse 0 2516 m and me 0 0526 m and the high value of ef 0 91 it can be concluded from fig 3 and fig 4 and the statistical evaluation that the model worked very well in estimating groundwater depths during the study period the groundwater recharge components for the monsoon season are presented in fig 5 a it can be seen that more than sixty two percent of the average seasonal total recharge field percolation is contributed during this period paddy areas contributed to more than 86 of total field percolation of the average percolation of 54 5 mm3 46 9 mm3 was from paddy areas the contributions from canal seepage and rainfall were sixteen and twenty two percent respectively the corresponding recharge contributions from field percolation canal seepage and rainfall in the winter were twenty five forty eight and twenty seven percent as presented in fig 5b analysis of the groundwater balance reveals that the block gets a normal net recharge of 47 1 mm3 during the monsoon increasing groundwater depth by an average of 1 20 m in contrast a negative average net recharge of 42 6 mm3 during the winter reduces the depth by an average of 1 09 m resulting in an average aquifer level rise of 0 11 m per year as discussed above the groundwater level in the block is rising at a steady rate and additional rise would worsen conditions it is necessary to develop and implement alternative management plans to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the block 5 2 calibration and validation results fig 6 shows the predicted and measured groundwater depth information for the saltmod calibration and validation calval the model predicted values closely matching the measured ones throughout the simulation nearly parallel results can be seen with the groundwater salinities results throughout the model calval as shown in fig 7 the information obtained through the calibration and validation periods was statistically evaluated rmse and me were also realistically low throughout calval as presented in table 4 ef values were reasonably high at 0 89 and 0 88 throughout calval with groundwater depth table 4 the parallel values were 0 87 and 0 85 for the groundwater salinities therefore it can be concluded from fig 6 fig 7 and table 4 that saltmod worked very well in foreseeing the groundwater depths and salinities in the block 5 3 results of sensitivity analysis fig 8 shows the sensitivity analysis results for groundwater levels and salinities data the results indicate that the effective porosity of the aquifer peq induces significant changes to the depth and salinity of the groundwater while soil leaching efficiency flq induces changes only to groundwater salinity and does not affect groundwater depth when peq was increased greater groundwater depth and lower salinity were found an increased peq value results in a groundwater level at 2 12 mbgs at the end of the simulation period which is 0 27 m deeper than the normal conditions while a decrease in value would result in an aquifer level at 1 62 mbgs which is 0 23 m shallower fig 8 the groundwater salinity results were 5 39 and 5 69 ds m with an increase and decrease in peq values against the normal value of 5 54 ds m as shown in fig 8 the corresponding salinity values were 5 22 and 5 86 ds m with an increase and decrease in flq values 5 4 assessment of simulated alternatives 5 4 1 scenario 1 base case results attained for the base case scenario show and steady rise in groundwater depth throughout the 2019 2033 modeling period fig 9 this is evident from the outcomes which show that groundwater depth will reach 0 69 mbgs in 2033 compared to the current 1 81 m therefore the groundwater level in the base case would go up at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m with an overall increase of 1 12 m in the next fourteen years furthermore in the base case the groundwater level will reach the root zone in the eleventh year in addition the salinity of the aquifer will increase to 6 39 ds m compared to the current value of 5 56 ds m as anticipated the steady decrease in the depth of the groundwater level is alarming and requires urgent intervention for the long term sustainability of agricultural production in the block 5 4 2 scenario 2 canal lining the results of the impact of channel lining on the overall water and salt balances of the study block over the next fourteen years are shown in fig 9 it can be observed from the results that complete canal lining can bring the groundwater to a depth of 2 79 mbgs compared to the current level of 1 81 mbgs under this scenario the groundwater level would decline at average yearly pace of 0 07 m versus rising 0 08 m under the base case scenario scenario 1 thus the total canal lining alone keeps the groundwater level at reasonable depth at the end of the modeling period groundwater salinity is predicted to drop to 4 97 ds m under this scenario versus the current level of 5 56 ds m a great volume of water can be saved by the lined canals as the unlined canals seep three hundred percent more than lined canals as aforementioned irrigation department 2018 the canals lining however requires huge capital investment 5 4 3 scenario 3 conjunctive water use the outcomes of this scenario demonstrate a steady and constant decline in groundwater depth during the prediction period fig 9 groundwater depth will decrease at a rate of 0 05 m per year and reach a level of 2 54 mbgs versus an initial level of 1 81 mbgs thus in this alternative the depth of groundwater will increase by 0 73 m in the fourteen year prediction period the groundwater salinity is predicted decline to a level of 5 12 ds m model results indicate that in this alternative the depth of groundwater would not get to the root zone all through the prediction period hence the conjunctive utilization of groundwater in combination with good quality canal water could keep the groundwater depth at a safe level as it is a requirement for long term agricultural sustainability 5 4 4 scenario 4 altered cropping pattern in this alternative sorghum is cultivated in twelve percent of the areas presently utilized to grow paddy as the water demand of the former is much lower the results of this alternative fig 9 show that the groundwater depth is predicted to decrease to 2 41 mbgs toward the end of the prediction period representing a yearly groundwater depth decline of 0 04 m versus a rise of 0 08 m in the base case groundwater salinity is predicted to decrease to 5 21 ds m so it appears that continually increasing paddy area is not sustainable to the block s hydro geological and topographical situations therefore part of the existing paddy area should be replaced by some low water requiring crops such as sorghum 5 4 5 scenario 5 dry conditions in the study area rainfall situations are rather erratic both in time and space thus a few years of intermittent drought can be more likely than continuous ones this alternative simulates the water salt balances of the block area during the fourteen years prediction period with irregular spells of dry years in this alternative there is an irregular decrease in the groundwater table during dry years fig 9 by the end of the simulation the groundwater depth is predicted to decrease by only 0 40 m at a mean yearly rate of 0 03 m the depth of groundwater is predicted remain at 2 21 mbgs and groundwater salinity is predicted to reduce to 5 33 ds m the decrease of groundwater depth in this alternative is explained by low net groundwater recharge in dry years 5 4 6 scenario 6 combined alternatives the implications of this alternative demonstrate that groundwater depth could reach 2 mbgs after the fourth year and 2 5 mbgs after the seventh year of simulation fig 9 remaining between 2 5 mbgs and 3 mbgs between the seventh and fourteenth year of simulation in this alternative the groundwater depth is predicted to decrease by 1 05 m in the entire prediction period at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m groundwater salinity under these conditions are predicted to lower to 4 81 ds m these reasonably favorable situations of water salt balances can be accomplished by changing the canal supply by 16 paddy cultivation by by 10 and tubewell withdrawal by 4 for the second fifth sixth and seventh years of the prediction and from the ninth year changing canal supply by 7 paddy cultivation by 6 and tubewell withdrawal by 2 thus it could be concluded that small changes of just 2 to 6 percent in different inputs could maintain the area from the abovementioned problems 6 conclusions and recommendations based on various measures of statistical analysis such as high r squared and model efficiency low rmse and me values it can be concluded that both models perform very well for the study block groundwater recharge model results show that the aquifer level in the region has been rising at a mean yearly rate of over 0 11 m for the past two decades and it will continue to rise unless preventive measures are taken because of higher net groundwater recharge in the monsoon season since the groundwater level is already high an additional rise would worsen the conditions it is necessary to develop and implement alternative management plans to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the block area as a follow up action a simulation model saltmod investigated the long term impact of diverse management alternatives on aquifer depth and salinity the management alternatives were formulated by making at least one alteration in the baseline conditions of various input parameters the simulated scenarios showed that under the base case alternative the aquifer levels would rise at a mean yearly rate of 0 08 m the most favorable scenario indicated that even a small alteration of two to six percent in different inputs would reduce the risks in this region hence apt management plans such as altered cropping patterns conjunctive water use and canal lining are recommended for future implementation some of the suggested recommendations would require socioeconomic and policy intervention credit authorship contribution statement ajay singh conceptualization

3429,hydrological processes in the critical zone are closely related to the soil bedrock structures however the effect of soil thickness on the rainfall runoff relationship on the hillslope with complex topography remains unclear surface runoff lateral subsurface runoff from soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff from the epikarst bedrock interface were monitored on two adjacent plots with deep and shallow 66 0 vs 35 4 cm soil thicknesses from june 2019 to december 2020 in the karst region of southwest china during the monitoring period surface and subsurface runoff account for 20 and 37 of the total runoff in the deep soil plot dsp and 3 and 43 in the shallow soil plot ssp this demonstrates that runoff from the soil epikarst system is predominant compared to the relatively small contribution of surface runoff in the ssp the surface topography wetness index twi was highly coupled with bedrock twi and the bedrock twi had a significant negative linear relationship p 0 01 with subsurface runoff moreover isotope hydrogen separation results showed that subsurface and epikarst runoff were dominated by pre event water but a higher contribution of event water was observed in the ssp than in the dsp these findings supported the hypothesis that rainwater could infiltrate the epikarst more easily in shallow soil slopes rainfall and surface runoff exhibited a linear relationship in the dry season and a non linear relationship in the rainy season indicating the occurrence of threshold rainfall runoff behavior the rainfall amount threshold for surface runoff was higher in dsp 44 7 mm than in ssp 39 5 mm and the corresponding variation of rainfall intensity interpretation was greater 54 vs 38 for subsurface runoff the rainfall amount threshold was higher in the dsp than in the ssp 91 0 vs 79 4 mm and the corresponding variation of soil moisture interpretation was higher 56 vs 20 this demonstrated that runoff can be better predicted at deeper soil hillslopes by rainfall and antecedent soil moisture accordingly this study emphasizes the importance of evaluating the spatial heterogeneity of soil thickness in hydrological process research keywords hydrograph separation karst ecosystems runoff generation saprolite water resource management 1 introduction the relationship between hillslope structure and rainfall runoff response remains only partially understood difficulties in elucidating this relationship can be attributed to the tremendous internal heterogeneity in key landscape and climatic variables the emerging critical zone cz research has emphasized multi layer integration which provides the basis for solving the above uncertainties the cz is defined as the spans from the tops of vegetation to a low permeability boundary of chronically saturated unweathered bedrock jin et al 2011 rempe and dietrich 2018 as a basic component of the cz the soil layer coevolved with the bedrock layer and is a key controlling factor for understanding hillslope hydrological processes liu et al 2013 riebe et al 2017 previous studies have showed that soil thickness and pore space in the soil determine the water storage capacity in the hillslope and its spatial distribution pattern can affect the relationship between rainfall and runoff response tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 also soil thickness is used as an important variable to characterize water flow and erosion characteristics in physics based hydrological models liu et al 2013 however comprehensive understanding of the interaction between soil thickness and hydrological processes is still lacking especially because environmental variables such as lithology and topography are considered which greatly limit the application and development of surface hydrological models soil thickness as an important factor affecting the relationship between rainfall and runoff can reflect the distribution of the hydraulic gradient and its effects on water movement and flow paths liu et al 2013 freer et al 2002 compared two hillslopes with shallow and thick soil layer they reported that when the bedrock topography is different from the surface and bedrock topographic wetness index twi the bedrock topography has a significant effect on the hydraulic gradient and thus controls the direction of the flow path in contrast the surface and bedrock topography jointly control runoff generation similar results have been reported elsewhere such as in the plastic lake hillslope in canada peters et al 1995 the minamitani hillslope in japan tani 1997 and the hillslope in british columbia in canada hutchinson and moore 2000 these studies reflect the influence of soil thickness on the hydrological process from a single watershed mcdonnell et al 1998 however the complexity of the microscale surface or bedrock topography has greatly affected the soil thickness and development of weathered bedrock banks et al 2009 mohr et al 2012 and the effects on the rainfall runoff response should be considered the threshold behaviors of rainfall and runoff are widely used because they can reflect dynamic factors such as soil moisture and precipitation characteristics which were observed in many study areas although the geological background was not consistent detty and mcguire 2010 graham et al 2010a graham et al 2010b tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 scaife and band 2017 threshold behavior is generally exhibited by the non linear relationship between rainfall and runoff when the rainfall exceeds a certain threshold the water flow path is connected and the slope of the cumulative curve of rainfall and runoff is close to 1 i e almost all rainwater is converted directly to runoff tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 tani 1997 the effect of soil thickness on threshold behavior is usually related to the soil storage capacity and the result is the slope differences calculated from the linear formula or the verification of the aforementioned non linear relationship buttle et al 2004 emphasized the dominant role of soil thickness in rainfall runoff response runoff is generated in almost all rainfall events with a thin soil layer and there was a linear relationship between runoff and rainfall runoff from the plot with thick soil layer was mainly controlled by amount of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture and there is a non linear relationship between runoff and rainfall in such cases buttle et al 2004 similarly the importance of soil thickness in determining the relationship between runoff and rainfall has been shown in other studies buttle et al 2000 lin 2006 lin and zhou 2008 threshold behavior was evaluated to clarify the runoff generation mechanism the physical condition of infiltration excess runoff is that the rainfall intensity is greater than the soil infiltration rate whereas saturation excess runoff occurs only when rainfall saturates the soil area dunne and black 1970 although threshold behavior can better reflect the hydrological connectivity of the hillslope neither direct nor indirect evidence has been sufficiently reported to determine the mechanism of rainfall runoff generation and the integration of multiple methods is conducive to further clarification of the relationship between threshold behavior and the underlying surface characteristics stable isotopes such as δd and δ18o can reflect water flow paths and moisture sources and evaluating their levels can greatly help in understanding the mechanisms that generate runoff on hillslopes rinderer et al 2018 stochinger et al 2014 von freyberg et al 2018 mcguire et al 2005 used an isotope δ18o tracer to analyze the water residence time of seven watersheds at various scales and found that topography is more influential than the watershed area in controlling the water flow movement the isotope water meteoric line and hydrograph separations can distinguish the contribution of event water and pre event water to help identify preferential flow and water recharge dai et al 2020 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b zhao et al 2016 cras et al 2007 reported that poorly developed soils and the lack of storage in the catchments led to a dominance of event water during storms however von freyberg et al 2018 showed that catchment outflow was typically dominated by pre event water soil wetness e g rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture and hydrogeological e g lithology and the structure of cz in the study area should be considered understanding these phenomena zhao et al 2013 found that the isotopic signatures demonstrated that piston and preferential flows coexist in the purple soil region of southwest china high antecedent soil water content and high rain intensity favor the formation of piston flow therefore an isotope tracer plays a significant role in indicating the mechanism of runoff generation and recharge discharge which can elucidate the effect of soil thickness in the rainfall runoff process karst landforms are known worldwide for their complex surface and subsurface topography accounting for approximately 7 12 of the earth s continental area and about one quarter of the global population is completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 karst dissolution is stronger in humid subtropical areas such as the karst region in southwest china which covers a total area of 5 4 105 km2 chen et al 2018 fu et al 2016 the carbonate rocks in this region are much older than their counterparts in southern and central europe and eastern north america and have undergone stronger petrification moreover this region is also not affected by glaciation process therefore strong and uneven chemical dissolution ensures that large areas of karst terrain are heterogeneous and fragmented furthermore abundant precipitation 1000 2000 mm annually and suitable temperature 14 24 c annually in the dominant tropical and subtropical monsoon provide natural conditions for karstification jiang et al 2014 the solubility of carbonate rocks and long term strong karstification result in broken and rugged terrain and high heterogeneity jiang et al 2014 the soil on karst hillslope is randomly districted on a small scale and influenced by micro geomorphology such as lapiaz dolines stone crevices stone gullies and karst caves these geomorphic structure features will prominently alter the hydrologic response and soil erosion processes emerging at a larger scale bonetti et al 2021 prominent environmental concerns such as rocky desertification frequent floods and droughts have been proven to be closely related to the unique karst geological structure with a thin soil layer jiang et al 2014 li et al 2019 and are now known to be key problems restricting human survival and sustainable development liu et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 however although some studies have mentioned the possible influence of soil and bedrock distribution on hydrological processes fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 the lack of independent monitoring to highlight the controlling role of soil has greatly restricted future research on the water cycle and water resources management in southwest china the premise of answering the above uncertainties is to understand the relationship of rainfall runoff in the karst hillslope in southwest china in non karst areas such as the loess platea of china and semi arid regions most of the water loss was caused by rainfall events with high rainfall intensity thunderstorm for short periods and dominant surface runoff peng and wang 2012 however subsurface runoff dominates hydrological processes on karst hillslope in southwest china fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 peng and wang 2012 zhu et al 2017 soil patches with high permeability and rocky outcrop areas with weak permeability are distributed alternately on the karst hillslope and the infiltration excess surface runoff generated can quickly penetrate the epikarst the subsurface runoff generation of a karst slope conforms to the fill and spill theory tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b studies have reached a consensus that the epikarst plays a particularly important role in the karst hydrological process which is the core region different from the non karst cz the epikarst comprises highly weathered carbonate bedrock immediately beneath the surface or the soil or exposed at the surface williams 2008 the prerequisite for subsurface runoff is water perched at the soil epikarst interface hartmann et al 2014 klimchouk 2004 parise et al 2015 williams 2008 soils have high infiltration capacity with steady infiltration from 40 to 130 mm h 1 in the karst region of southwest china chen et al 2011 which is higher than the soil epikarst interface stable infiltration rate 35 to 40 mm h 1 fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this means that the soil epikarst interface can easily generate runoff when rainfall conditions including rainfall amount and intensity are satisfied water stable isotopes were used to trace spring recharge groundwater exchange and water source identification at the small watershed scale chen et al 2018 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b a few studies have explored the rainfall runoff relationship at the hillslope scale through in situ simulation experiments fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b however although these studies explored rainfall runoff generation mechanisms their applicability remains unclear owing to a lack of natural monitoring data furthermore the mechanism of runoff generation needs to be clarified using water isotopes tracer methods such as the mixing process of event water and pre event water and the residence time of rainwater in this study natural monitoring of rainfall and runoff discharge dynamics on two adjacent karst hillslope plots with different soil thicknesses were conducted from june 2019 to december 2020 we present the following hypotheses for testing in this research due to the different soil thicknesses 1 subsurface runoff dominates hillslope hydrology but it is markedly differentiated 2 the inconsistent thresholds of rainfall runoff are caused by differences in soil water deficit and 3 the inconsistent contribution of event water to runoff is caused by differences in soil infiltration capacity our large datasets allowed us to explore the hydrological behavior of the karst hillslope and provide a scientific basis for eco hydrological processes and modeling studies in karstic landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the study site is a 1 14 km2 catchment named mulian catchment 24 43 n 108 18 e located in huanjiang county northwest guangxi province in southwest china fig 1 a the catchment is the site for long term field research by the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of science fig 1b it is a representative cockpit karst catchment developed on pure dolomite the ratios of cao and mgo in the bedrock are 30 and 20 respectively and is characterized by a flat depression surrounded by the peak of overlapping hills and ridges excluding an outlet in the northeast ford and williams 2007 fu et al 2015 elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m above sea level approximately 60 of slopes have a gradient greater than 20 this gradient was considered the threshold slopes because soil erosion indices for land slopes greater than 20 in the carbonate rock areas in southwest china exceeded the soil loss tolerance rate of 2 to 5 tons acre per year 294 to 1235 tons km2 per year in the united states hu et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 the study site has a humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 19 6 c the monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures occurred in july and february respectively the average annual rainfall is approximately 1 456 mm 1980 2013 and the average rainfall in the rainy season from may to september accounts for approximately 74 of the annual rainfall wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b our previous geophysical exploration at the catchment scale revealed that the geology comprises middle carboniferous c2 dolomite and dolomitic limestone zhang et al 2021 the soils are brown calcareous soil with a clay to clay loam texture 25 to 50 silt and 30 to 60 clay the soil thickness varies between 0 and 6 4 m but the average thickness of the slopes is approximately 30 cm and contains massive amounts of rock fragments with particle size greater than 2 mm wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b 2 2 description of experiment plot we selected two adjacent slope experimental plots separated by a space of 5 m and having a projected area of 5 20 m to perform natural monitoring fig 1c a soil drill was used to drill to the soil epikarst interface on a grid of 1 1 m and the soil depth was measured to calculate the topography for both the surface and bedrock fig 2 one plot had a shallow soil layer and the other had a relatively deep soil layer comprising the shallow soil plot ssp and deep soil plot dsp respectively fig 2 the average soil thickness of the ssp was 35 4 39 46 cm and that of the dsp was 66 0 33 26 cm the bedrock outcrop ratios in the dsp and ssp were 4 and 21 respectively the rock fragments in the dsp and ssp were 7 3 and 15 9 respectively wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b the topographic wetness index twi with 1 1 m grid was used to quantify the surface and subsurface bedrock topography the twi is calculated as follows freer et al 2002 1 twi ln α tan β where α is the upslope confluence area of unit contour length flowing through any point on the slope surface β is the local slope angle and tanβ is the slope of this point notably it is normal for twi to be negative which is attributed to the influence of microtopography on grid calculation caused by high resolution 1 1 m in this study the material of each plot was completely removed from the unweathered bedrock which had an average vertical depth of 4 m using a backhoe fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this depth reached the bedrock layer with no visible rock fractures and conduits and a steady infiltration rate of 3 mm h 1 fu et al 2015 strongly weathered product similar to the saprolite layer at the soil bedrock in non karst areas between the soil and epikarst interface was observed in dsp whereas saprolite was not observed in the ssp as shown in fig 2b concrete walls were installed deep into the epikarst surface on three sides of the plots the left right and upper edges to prevent surface runoff and soil epikarst interface runoff exchange between adjacent plots fig 1e and f the above measures can ensure that the soil layer to soil epikarst interface is isolated undisturbed soil and saprolite samples were collected to measure the soil properties we collected soil samples from both upslope and downslope areas covered with soil in addition valuable saprolite samples were collected only on the soil epikarst interface at the upslope from the dsp saturate soil hydraulic conductivity ks cm h 1 using the constant head method jia et al 2013 the disturbed soil was passed through a 1 mm sieve and was analyzed for particle sizes by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england soil and saprolite properties are shown in table 1 the permeability of dsp was lower than that of ssp 2 3 site instrumentation and hydrometric data monitoring rainfall quantities were measured using an automatic tipping bucket with a 0 1 mm resolution hobo event data logger usa at meteorological stations in the catchment fig 1a and b surface runoff from the atmosphere soil interface subsurface runoff from the soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff from the epikarst bedrock interface were measured at the outlet of the two experimental plots using a tipping bucket connected by a hosepipe and equipped with a hobo event recorder fig 1c f subsurface runoff monitoring was carried out in five flow units each with a width of 1 m and the instruments were numbered as follows ssr1 ssr2 ssr3 ssr4 and ssr5 fig 1d e the soil moisture at the start of each rainfall event was used as an index of antecedent soil moisture and was assumed to represent the experimental wetness condition from june to december 2019 we measured soil moisture before and after every rainfall event using a portable tdr probe at the same locations from december 15 2019 to october 30 2020 soil moisture was measured for 5 min per time using vertically installed 5 cm long soil moisture probes stevens hydra probe at the downslope position fig 2 2 4 water sampling and analysis rainwater was sampled with a 20 cm diameter glass funnel connected to a 1 1 high density polyethylene bottle a table tennis ball was placed in a funnel to reduce evaporation schotterer 1996 a total of 134 rainfall isotope samples were collected daily 52 and 82 samples were collected in 2019 and 2020 respectively all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and preserved at 4 c from the dsp and ssp 18 and 99 surface runoff water isotope samples were collected respectively there were 6 5 20 29 and 76 water isotope samples collected by ssr1 ssr2 ssr3 ssr4 and ssr5 in the dsp respectively and 144 146 112 137 and 41 samples were collected by ssr1 ssr2 ssr3 ssr4 and ssr5 in the ssp respectively the number of epikarst runoff water isotope samples collected from dsp and ssp were 352 and 351 respectively all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and preserved at 4 c the δ 18o and δd stable isotopes of water samples were measured using los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dlt 100 usa west et al 2010 via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy at johns hopkins university jhu following the iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 the results were reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and defined relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water as given by the following equation 2 δ d δ 18 o r sample r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d where r represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and rstandard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard form the δ value was expressed in parts per thousand permit the precision of measurement of δd was 0 5 and that of δ 18o was 0 2 at the 2σ criterion 2 5 rainfall and runoff events to analyze rainfall event rainfall events were defined as having total rainfall 5 mm and peak hourly rainfall intensity ipeak 1 5 mm h 1 distinct events were separated by greater than 12 h without rainfall saffarpour et al 2016 to assess runoff threshold behavior the surface runoff hydrograph was divided into individual events runoff events began when the stream discharge hydrograph started to rise from its initial low flow value events ended either when a new rainfall event started or 96 h after the end of a rainfall event in unusually wet situations where elevated flow continued saffarpour et al 2016 in the rainy season there were 46 and 47 surface runoff events in the dsp and ssp respectively in the dry seaon there were 7 and 8 surface runoff events in the dsp and ssp respectively the diagrams of rainfall and runoff were obtained through the approaches described by janzen and mcdonnell 2015 and detty and mcguire 2010 who considered the impact of rainfall amount rainfall intensity and soil moisture on event runoff because subsurface runoff often lasts for a long time this process is easily affected by superimposed rainfall events we defined subsurface runoff from the start of the end of runoff as a subsurface runoff event to avoid the above uncertainties in the rainy season 30 and 29 subsurface runoff events were observed in the dsp and ssp respectively no subsurface runoff was observed in the dry season 2 6 approaches for threshold output surface runoff and subsurface runoff threshold behaviors compared to rainfall was measured using a piecewise regression analysis pra pra is a broken stick model where two or more lines meet at unknown points called breakpoints these breakpoints are threshold values the segmented package in r software was used to execute the pra it estimates that breakpoints based on a maximum likelihood approach that constrains regression segments are nearly continuous wei et al 2020 in statistics a likelihood function is a function of the parameters of a statistical model when given data likelihood functions play a key role in statistical inference especially the methods for estimating a parameter from a set of statistics our previous study found no threshold responses between asi antecedent soil water and surface runoff subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff even though there were trends towards positive relationships between them wang et al 2022 therefore asi values were not considered in the value of thresholds in this study before calculating the threshold we first performed logarithmic conversion on surface runoff and subsurface runoff data this was because the runoff generated by extreme rainfall was far greater than that generated by other rainfall events and some key threshold information would have been obscured without converting data 2 7 hydrograph separation this study assumed a simple mixing of two end member event water and pre event water to quantify the mixing proportions of rainwater recharging the subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff here the hydrograph refers to the flow into each tipping bucket we used the weighted mean of the rainfall samples collected daily as the event water cevent and the isotope of subsurface runoff and epikasrt runoff of the days before as the pre event water cpre event pre event was defined as one day before the event their contributions were calculated using the following equations wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b 3 c event x event c event 1 x event c pre event where x event is the concentration of water discharge by event water if the proportion of water source was overestimated the negative estimation was excluded zhao et al 2016 specifically a proportion above 100 was recorded as 100 and a proportion below 0 was recorded as 0 zhao et al 2016 3 results 3 1 surface and bedrock topography characteristics the twi of the surface dsp 3 48 1 09 ssp 2 98 1 39 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the bedrock dsp 2 35 1 36 ssp 2 46 1 27 fig 3 the coefficient of variation cv of twi was small due to the equally flat surface of the dsp 0 31 while the cv of ssp was 0 47 the bedrock terrain was more complex than the surface terrain showing a higher cv which was 0 58 and 0 52 in the dsp and ssp respectively fig 3 the coupling degree between the surface and bedrock topography in ssp was higher than that in the dsp fig 3 based on the linear regression analysis of twi values of the surface and bedrock the surface and bedrock twi of two plots showed a significantly positive linear correlation p 0 05 the expressions of dsp and ssp were y 0 27x 1 41 n 110 r 2 0 30 p 0 05 and y 0 54x 0 87 n 110 r 2 0 34 p 0 001 respectively 3 2 runoff characteristics the runoff time series and δd values on a daily scale are shown in fig 4 the runoff showed obvious stage characteristics with high flow in the rainy season may to september and low discharge in the dry season october to april the number of rainfall runoff events in the dsp were less but the runoff amount of single events was large the total surface runoff in the dsp 91 054 l was much higher than that in the ssp 29 933 l the same result was observed in the subsurface runoff but the subsurface runoff was larger in the ssp 177 170 l than that in the dsp 138 597 l because the duration of rainfall runoff events were longer especially during the dry season with no rain fig 4 from october 17 2019 to january 17 2020 the amount of rainfall was only 13 8 mm but the discharge of the epikarst was maintained for 3 months however the ability to supply water is limited by wet conditions from march 2 to april 6 2019 i e the ending and beginning of the dry season of the rainfall amounted up to 324 6 mm but no outflow from the epikarst was observed in both the dsp and ssp the runoff component of the karst slope was mainly from the soil epikarst system including the subsurface and epiakrst runoff in both the dsp and ssp which account for 79 96 and 96 96 of the total runoff respectively epikarst contributed to most of the runoff fig 5 a and b the portion of surface runoff of the dsp 20 04 was significantly higher than that of the ssp 3 04 the surface runoff in dsp and ssp were 910 5 and 299 3 mm accounting for 31 55 and 10 37 of the total rainfall depth respectively the continuous outflow of the epikarst runoff was much higher than the rainfall amount which usually occurs in the dry season fig 5 this means that the epikarst may be connected during the outflow period forming a continuous perched saturated zone 3 3 rainwater and runoff isotope characteristics 3 3 1 isotope dynamic over the monitoring period runoff isotopes were controlled by the input rainfall isotopes the rainfall amount in the second half of 2019 and 2020 was 725 2 mm and 1626 4 mm fig 4 respectively with weighted mean of 40 33 and 51 69 for precipitation isotopes correspondingly the isotope values of each runoff component in 2019 were more positive than those in 2020 the average value of δd of the surface runoff was the lowest dsp 49 41 ssp 39 82 followed by the subsurface runoff dsp 35 77 ssp 32 50 and the largest in the epikarst runoff dsp 31 28 ssp 30 80 the results of a one way anova of the δd showed that there were significant differences between surface and subsurface runoff in the dsp and ssp respectively fig 6 b and c in contrast there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the isotope values of epikarst runoff between the dsp and ssp 3 3 2 meteoric water line mwl and hydrograph separation fig 7 shows the stable isotope values of different runoff components obtained during the sampling period plotted with the local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl had a slope of 7 29 and an intercept of 8 81 which were both lower than the slope 8 0 and the intercept 10 0 of the global mwl the slope of mwl in the dsp varies widely ranging from 5 74 to 7 31 the mwl slope of the epikarst runoff was the smallest which was within the slope range of the soil evaporation mwl 3 5 6 horita 2005 the mwl slope of the subsurface runoff is higher than that of the surface runoff on the contrary the mwl slope of the runoff components in the ssp was close to the lmwl with the slope ranging from 6 66 to 7 21 fig 7b pre event water controlled the subsurface and epikarst runoff during the monitoring period the mean proportions of pre event water in the dsp and ssp were 86 22 and 82 19 of subsurface runoff respectively which were lower than those in the epikarst runoff 98 43 and 98 21 in dsp and ssp respectively in addition event water contributions were higher for particular events and the proportion of event water in ssp was higher than that in dsp fig 8 b and c for example a total rainfall of 777 9 mm was measured from september 7 to october 2020 the average contribution of event in the dsp and ssp were 17 18 and 29 55 respectively comparatively the mean proportion of event water in the epikarst was 5 73 and 10 56 respectively 3 4 rainfall runoff threshold behavior a non linear relationship was observed both in the dsp and ssp in the rainy season which indicated notable threshold behavior in rainfall and surface runoff on karst slopes the rainfall amount ranged from 5 2 to 335 0 mm with 1 h maximum rainfall intensities mri ranging from 2 4 to 77 6 mm 1 during the rainy season fig 9 a and b the rainfall amount threshold of surface runoff generation in dsp was higher than that in ssp which were 44 7 mm and 39 5 mm respectively a significant linear relationship between runoff and mri was observed in both the dsp and ssp but dsp had a higher explanatory for runoff volume however compared to the rainy season there was no threshold behavior on surface runoff in the dry season and rainfall and surface runoff showed a significantly positive linear relationship fig 9c and d threshold behavior was also observed in the subsurface runoff and there was a significant non linear relationship between rainfall amounts for both dsp and ssp fig 10 the rainfall threshold of subsurface runoff in the dsp 91 0 mm was higher than that in the ssp 79 4 mm and it was more affected by soil moisture linear regression shows that the correlation between soil moisture and subsurface runoff in the dsp r 2 0 56 p 0 01 was considerably higher than that in the ssp r 2 0 20 p 0 05 4 discussion previous studies have shown that the spatial distribution of soil thickness partially determines the water storage capacity and flow path of the hillslope and significantly affects hydrological connectivity and runoff generation burt and mcdonnell 2015 however our understanding of runoff contributions from hillslopes is based on studies conducted in steep landscapes with thin soils burt and mcdonnell 2015 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 here we discuss and provide explanations summarized by a conceptual diagram for the effect of soil thickness on the structure and runoff characteristics of the karst cz 4 1 runoff characteristics on karst slope under different soil thickness based on the monitoring of runoff generation at different interfaces surface runoff at the atmosphere soil interface subsurface runoff at the soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff at the epikarst bedrock interface this study revealed that surface runoff was relatively minimal whereas subsurface runoff was predominant in the karst slope the relatively small surface runoff on the karst slope can be attributed to its saturated excess generation mechanism wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this result could be generalized to the entire karst slope area of southwest china as it is consistent with the lower surface runoff coefficients reported in previous studies chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 zhu et al 2017 the surface runoff of the hillslope with thick soil was higher than that of the slope with shallow soil fig 4 many previous studies have shown that surface runoff increases with increased soil depth buttle et al 2000 buttle et al 2004 lin 2006 lin and zhou 2008 woolhiser et al 2006 fu et al 2011 this observation is related to the mechanism of runoff generation determined by the soil thickness buttle et al 2000 summarized that infiltration excess runoff is the main runoff generation in bedrock outcrops while macropore preferential flow dominates the soil bedrock interface runoff in shallow soil areas similar results were found in the shale hills watershed and lin 2006 suggest that preferential flow was more likely to be generated in shallow soil than in thick soil areas the above view was confirmed by the higher permeability of the ssp than that of the dsp table 1 in this study the runoff in the epikarst system including lateral soil epikarst runoff and lateral epikarst bedrock runoff dominates the total runoff of karst hillslopes these two types of flow are not consistent at spatial and temporal scales the lateral soil bedrock interface runoff is temporary which is mainly attributed to the high randomness of the preferential flow of fractures in karst areas leading to the rapid vertical infiltration of water into the epikarst bedrock interface two reasons can account for the higher proportion of lateral soil epikarst runoff in ssp in southwest karst hillslopes soil water storage capacity may be less important than in non karst areas due to the prevalence of vertical preferential flow paths e g dolines funnels and bedrock fractures and pipelines wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b xu et al 2020 secondly bedrock outcrops which are hard and have low permeability generally exist in ssp which is conducive to water accumulation leading to greater saturation of the soil bedrock interface and generated lateral runoff in addition the greater evapotranspiration in dsp is one of the major reasons for the lower proportion of lateral soil epikarst runoff in the ssp ben yona et al 2020 compared the hydrologic processes of two similarly sized watersheds and found that the doubled annual precipitation in a karstic watershed generates an annual streamflow that is five times more than that in the basaltic watershed a larger fraction of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration at the basaltic watershed and a larger portion of the rainfall percolates to the epikarst through preferential flow and appears as baseflow at the karstic watershed this indicates that karst hillslopes with deep soil are more similar to non karst features in hydrological processes which is related to the degree of karst dissolution our catchment scale geophysical findings suggest that dolomite weathering may be less severe than previously thought which confirms the necessity of noting the effects of bedrock weathering even on catchments with the same lithology such as limestone and dolomite when monitoring hydrological processes zhang et al 2021 epikarst runoff is a crucial component of the karst slope water budget with a longer runoff duration than other runoff components fig 5c and d for example at the end of the rainy season in 2020 although there was no effective rainfall event for two months october to december the epikarst continued to flow out fig 4 however in terms of experimental design the epikarst cannot be isolated due to the limited experimental means it may be necessary to separate the epikarst runoff when calculating the rainfall runoff response balance on karst hillslopes fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 previous studies have strongly emphasized the important role of epikarst in regulating the distribution of karst water resources according to mangin 1973 the epikarstic aquifer is a perched saturated zone within the superficial part of the karst that stores a part of the infiltrated water the epikarst overlies the infiltration zone itself which is intersected by occasional enlarged vertical fractures and karst conduits thus the base of the epikarst acts as an aquitard and may contain a local perched water table which could be the so called epikarstic aquifer hartmann et al 2014 therefore the epikarst acts like a water tank providing a continuous supply of mobile water in both dsp and ssp fig 3 the absence of significant differences between the isotope values of epikarst runoff of two plots explain the water tank effect fig 6 however flow monitoring alone may not be enough to reflect the effect of soil thickness on epikarst runoff because the epikarst of the two experimental plots are in the same saturated layer 4 2 soil thickness controls the relationship between topography and runoff when surface runoff is generated by infiltration excess soil thickness will not necessarily be the main factor controlling the surface topography and runoff nevertheless it rarely happens that the intensity of rainfall events exceeds the soil infiltration capacity wang et al 2018 therefore soil thickness is the first order factor that controls runoff generation most of the time detty and mcguire 2010 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 nadal romero et al 2018 however most studies on the relationship between soil thickness topography and runoff have focused on the watershed scale jencso et al 2010 jencso et al 2010 found that surface topography directly influences hydraulic gradients which means that the relationship between micro topography and hydrological processes is also worth paying attention to this spatial heterogeneity is the basic feature of karst czs that distinguish them from non karst cz in this context deeper soils would be expected to have higher storage capacities than steeper watersheds with thinner soils which leads to a more sensitive response of ssp to rainfall fig 4 however regardless of dsp or ssp surface runoff accounts for only a small part of the total runoff therefore more attention should be paid to the influence of bedrock topography on runoff subsurface runoff is specifically related to the bedrock topography which is further determined by the soil thickness a significant negative linear relationship between subsurface runoff and twi was observed in the ssp but no linear relationship was observed in the dsp fig 11 which indicates that bedrock twi can be used to predict subsurface runoff in the shallow soil slope in the karst area this is consistent with the results of the study by fu et al 2016 who found that more than 70 of the total rainfall water moved vertically through the shallow soil layer perched on the highly irregular epikarst surface and was then redistributed by the epikarst system because subsurface flow occurred on the soil epikarst interface depressions were filled on the epikarst surface and water was held by the epikarst and deep percolation fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 however the mechanism of runoff generation in the dsp may require further explanation though observational or simulated experiments in addition to the above differences in runoff generation mechanism and rainfall buffer capacity the structure of the cz under the influence of soil thickness cannot be ignored our previous survey on geological drilling at the watershed scale zhang et al 2021 and profile scale investigations fig 2 revealed that the interface between deep soil and bedrock generally forms a soil saprolite interface with a low permeability coefficient table 1 however the shallow soil was directly connected to the weathered bedrock with widespread fissures fig 2b the study by banks et al 2009 indicated that saprolite has a lower permeability than the underlying fractured bedrock this means that the existence of saprolite will directly determine the soil bedrock lateral runoff and perched water level harr 1977 and graham et al 1997 reported that saprolite may not be present in some mountainous environments which is supported by observations in many mountainous regions where bedrock outcrops dominate the landscape due to the frequent outcropping of bedrock in the karst area of southwest china jiang et al 2014 the influence of this composite structure on hydrological processes warrants further exploration in this study the soil depth varies greatly even within small plots which indicates the multi interface and randomness of the hydrological process on the karst hillslopes of southwest china we also monitored and analyzed the rainfall runoff relationship in the remaining plots 12 experimental plots with different types of vegetation wang et al 2022 the result showed that soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on surface runoff when considered rock fragments root depth soil depth and bedrock outcrops by using the structural equation model this demonstrates that the variability of soil depth is an unavoidable problem from the perspective of hydrological model whether the hydrological models are distributed lumped or semi distributed lumped in karst areas the primary consideration is the characterization of structures hartmann et al 2014 hartmann et al 2017 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 however although the existing eco hydrological modes have been considerably developed it is difficult to quantify the geotechnical structures of the karst watershed such as the soil and epikarst due to the complexity of the karst cz xu et al 2020 the earth s cz emphasizes interdisciplinary and scales integration geophysical exploration and computerized deep learning have been applied in the karst area to provide methodological support for the quantification of cz structures showing great developmental prospects in combination with the models chen et al 2018 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 secondly most hydrological models especially those created at large scales deal with soil thickness estimates using empirical equations including those for evaluating transfer functions therefore identifying the factors controlling soil thickness variation such as bedrock outcrop and elevation and slope is a key step as some factors can be detected by remote sensing methods which facilitates cross spatial integration 4 3 soil thickness controls the isotopes of runoff components stable isotopes of water have been widely used to provide insight into the functioning of karst systems chen et al 2018 mudarra and andreo 2011 in the present study the water stable isotopes supported our previous explanation of the mechanism of surface and subsurface runoff generation in particular the effect of soil thickness in the epikarst has also been captured by isotope signals under the same steady state evaporation condition the main distinction between the relationship between runoff water and δd δ18o in saturated and unsaturated conditions is that the slope of the unsaturated evaporation line tends to decrease this is because as the evaporation front moves down the water vapor above the front is diffused and transported more intensively which makes the kinetic fractionation increasingly important bernes and allison 1988 based on this we believe that the temporary stagnant layer in the dsp under the influence of saprolite leads to saturated subsurface runoff in addition the low permeability of the saprolite prevents water infiltration which leads to unsaturated runoff in epikasrt and is more susceptible to evaporation therefore we observed that the slope of the water meteoric line in the epikarst runoff was close to the soil evaporation line horita 2005 notably this does not necessarily indicate that the stable isotopes in epikarst runoff had experienced evaporative fractionation instead this may indicate surface water and subsurface water interactions in this low lying humid basin floor dai et al 2020 the mwl slope of each runoff component in the ssp are close to each other which means that the mixing effect of each water pool is relatively sufficient the contribution of pre event water to event water confirmed the above results that is the proportion of event rainwater in subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff in ssp was higher than that in dsp pre event water has been reported to dominate the storm hydrograph in most natural humid systems klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the results support this conclusion in the present study area wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b found that pre event water contributed to 89 5 and 93 4 of the volume of the two springs during the wet season we found that event water contributions were higher for particular events in both the dsp and ssp this is consistent with the results of cras et al 2007 who observed that at peak flow 100 of the hydrograph was comprised of event water during hydrograph recession pre event water contributions increased to 40 and up to 90 of streamflow volume poorly developed soils together with the lack of storage in the catchments led to the dominance of event water during storms cras et al 2007 this also explains why the proportion of event water in the ssp is higher than that in the dsp however isotope hydrograph studies focusing on precipitation events in karst region are rare wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b therefore to deepen the understanding of karst hydrological processes subsequent studies need to analyze the isotope hydrograph of rainstorm processes at the intra event scale 4 4 soil thickness controls rainfall runoff relationships hydrologists have found that the threshold behavior of runoff generation at the hillslope and catchment scales in humid regions saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the phenomenon of qualitative change with the increase in flow and rainfall amount essentially reflects the connection of fast water delivery channels saffarpour et al 2016 significant threshold effects were observed during the rainy season in both the dsp and ssp fig 9 similar catchment wetness thresholds for connectivity and runoff generation have been reported in other studies detty and mcguire 2010 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the threshold values of the rainfall amount in the dsp and ssp was 44 7 and 39 5 mm respectively the rainfall threshold for the surface runoff initiation determined in the present study fell within the range of previously published data ali et al 2015 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 our simulated rainfall experiment results showed that the rainfall intensity threshold must be larger than the steady infiltration rate of the soil epikarst interface which was the prerequisite for the saturation of the epikarst surface depression and soil layer a steady soil epikarst infiltration rate was estimated 40 mm h 1 according to the surface runoff generation mechanism wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b our previous study based on simulated rainfall monitoring showed that the rainfall intensity threshold of karst slope surface runoff was 40 mm h 1 which is approximately equal to the stable infiltration rate of the epikarst wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this study also proved that the simulation results were suitable for natural monitoring the larger threshold in dsp indicates that the soil layer can store more water before surface runoff generates it according to the results of the study by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the threshold values for subsurface runoff generation was 55 mm and larger values were observed in this study for both dsp and ssp fig 10 this is attributed to the highly soil permeable capacity in karst areas when the rainfall amount exceeded this threshold value the storm runoff increased linearly with rainfall amount the threshold of runoff in the dsp was higher than that in the ssp which means that subsurface runoff may also be influenced by soil moisture this study found a significant linear relationship between rainfall intensity and surface runoff a similar finding regarding the role of intensity was reported by janzen and mcdonnell 2015 who found that the panola hillslope can produce significant runoff from dry antecedent conditions when high intensity rainfall occurs in contrast the surface runoff in ssp is less affected by rainfall intensity and is related to a higher permeability coefficient scaife et al 2020 found that maximum rainfall intensity did not contribute to fast flow in forested catchments and was attributed to highly conductive forest soils some studies have also reported these results in site with humid temperate and very high soil hydraulic conductivity capacities which indicates that maximum rainfall intensity had little impact on surface runoff generation ali et al 2015 graham et al 2010a graham et al 2010b tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 in contrast the surface runoff in the dry season was not related to the rainfall intensity but was affected by soil moisture typical high intensity rainfall is mostly generated during the rainy season so the probability of infiltration exceed is low wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b conversely soil moisture in the dry season determines whether the conditions of saturated infiltration runoff production can be achieved fu et al 2016 as expected subsurface runoff in the dsp was more susceptible to the influence of wetness conditions because the soil moisture contributes more to subsurface runoff variability fig 10 similar results were obtained from our previous simulation of rainfall in the dsp fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 these results support those of previous studies that demonstrated a linearly increasing stormflow response with greater p precipitation or p asi antecedent soil moisture precipitation after a well defined threshold reflecting soil moisture storage characteristics hillslope drainage efficiency saturated area connectivity and runoff generation processes detty and mcguire 2010 graham et al 2010a graham et al 2010b penna et al 2011 scaife and band 2017 scaife et al 2020 in the ssp rainfall features had a higher priority on runoff than in the dsp this may be due to the high conductivity of soil and the enhanced porosity and permeability of the epikarst zone and bedrock outcrops in the ssp hartmann et al 2021 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 and detty and mcguire 2010 reported that topography is the main factor influencing water redistribution in shallow soil hillslope although the thin soil layer may become saturated during rainfall events vertical bypass flow through visible sub vertical fissures conduits or caves delivers excess water vertically to the epikarst thus soil moisture was considered to have a relative effect on subsurface runoff in ssp we constructed a conceptual model for runoff components that were dependent on the different soil thicknesses in a karst slope and integrated our results over two representative profiles fig 12 in the present study water deficit determines that the rainfall threshold of surface runoff is higher 44 mm vs 39 mm in experimental plots with larger soil thickness rainwater rapidly infitrates the shallow soil layer and is converted into subsurface runoff via preferential flow yielding minimal surface runoff 3 the soil thickness determines the soil and bedrock structure of the cz of the karst hillslope that is whether there is saprolite underneath the soil layer the permeability of saprolite is much lower than the soil layer and as rainwater seeps from the surface it creates a perched saturated zone where the mwl of mobile water remains close to the lmwl saprolite also prevents or delays the exchange between surface runoff and soil epikarst interface runoff which contributes to a lower proportion of event water in contrast the flow path of the shallow soil layer was not affected or was only slightly affected by the saprolite therefore the runoff components are relatively mixed and the proportion of event water in subsurface runoff was higher this conceptual model emphasizes the controlling effect of soil thickness on the cz structure and hydrological process in karst hillslope and provides new insight into the eco hydrological process and the construction of models it also provides a theoretical and practical basis for water resource management and control at the watershed scale 5 conclusion we linked soil thickness to the cz structure and explored its influence on the relationship between rainfall and runoff 1 surface runoff is relatively rare and has a short duration while subsurface runoff is a universal characteristic of karst areas the epikarst is a crucial component of the karst slope that controls runoff and epikarst runoff spans a longer duration which indicates the critical role of this zone in flow regulation functions storage and release functions of the karst hydrologic systems 2 soil thickness controls runoff composition which is highlighted by the finding that the ssp slope yields less surface runoff and more subsurface runoff the surface and bedrock topography are highly coupled in the ssp and a significant linear relationship between subsurface runoff and bedrock topography in the ssp was observed these findings suggest that soil thickness mainly affected the surface runoff in dsp but the subsurface runoff in ssp 3 significant threshold behavior was observed in surface runoff and subsurface runoff both in dsp and ssp this threshold behavior is of great significance for water resources management and control in the karst region of southwest china as flood disasters occur frequently in this region 4 saprolite acts as a buffer and reduces the seepage of water from the soil to the epikarst the mixing degree of runoff components in the ssp and the contribution proportion of event water from rainfall events were higher it is helpful in understanding the role of the epikarst in

3429,hydrological processes in the critical zone are closely related to the soil bedrock structures however the effect of soil thickness on the rainfall runoff relationship on the hillslope with complex topography remains unclear surface runoff lateral subsurface runoff from soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff from the epikarst bedrock interface were monitored on two adjacent plots with deep and shallow 66 0 vs 35 4 cm soil thicknesses from june 2019 to december 2020 in the karst region of southwest china during the monitoring period surface and subsurface runoff account for 20 and 37 of the total runoff in the deep soil plot dsp and 3 and 43 in the shallow soil plot ssp this demonstrates that runoff from the soil epikarst system is predominant compared to the relatively small contribution of surface runoff in the ssp the surface topography wetness index twi was highly coupled with bedrock twi and the bedrock twi had a significant negative linear relationship p 0 01 with subsurface runoff moreover isotope hydrogen separation results showed that subsurface and epikarst runoff were dominated by pre event water but a higher contribution of event water was observed in the ssp than in the dsp these findings supported the hypothesis that rainwater could infiltrate the epikarst more easily in shallow soil slopes rainfall and surface runoff exhibited a linear relationship in the dry season and a non linear relationship in the rainy season indicating the occurrence of threshold rainfall runoff behavior the rainfall amount threshold for surface runoff was higher in dsp 44 7 mm than in ssp 39 5 mm and the corresponding variation of rainfall intensity interpretation was greater 54 vs 38 for subsurface runoff the rainfall amount threshold was higher in the dsp than in the ssp 91 0 vs 79 4 mm and the corresponding variation of soil moisture interpretation was higher 56 vs 20 this demonstrated that runoff can be better predicted at deeper soil hillslopes by rainfall and antecedent soil moisture accordingly this study emphasizes the importance of evaluating the spatial heterogeneity of soil thickness in hydrological process research keywords hydrograph separation karst ecosystems runoff generation saprolite water resource management 1 introduction the relationship between hillslope structure and rainfall runoff response remains only partially understood difficulties in elucidating this relationship can be attributed to the tremendous internal heterogeneity in key landscape and climatic variables the emerging critical zone cz research has emphasized multi layer integration which provides the basis for solving the above uncertainties the cz is defined as the spans from the tops of vegetation to a low permeability boundary of chronically saturated unweathered bedrock jin et al 2011 rempe and dietrich 2018 as a basic component of the cz the soil layer coevolved with the bedrock layer and is a key controlling factor for understanding hillslope hydrological processes liu et al 2013 riebe et al 2017 previous studies have showed that soil thickness and pore space in the soil determine the water storage capacity in the hillslope and its spatial distribution pattern can affect the relationship between rainfall and runoff response tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 also soil thickness is used as an important variable to characterize water flow and erosion characteristics in physics based hydrological models liu et al 2013 however comprehensive understanding of the interaction between soil thickness and hydrological processes is still lacking especially because environmental variables such as lithology and topography are considered which greatly limit the application and development of surface hydrological models soil thickness as an important factor affecting the relationship between rainfall and runoff can reflect the distribution of the hydraulic gradient and its effects on water movement and flow paths liu et al 2013 freer et al 2002 compared two hillslopes with shallow and thick soil layer they reported that when the bedrock topography is different from the surface and bedrock topographic wetness index twi the bedrock topography has a significant effect on the hydraulic gradient and thus controls the direction of the flow path in contrast the surface and bedrock topography jointly control runoff generation similar results have been reported elsewhere such as in the plastic lake hillslope in canada peters et al 1995 the minamitani hillslope in japan tani 1997 and the hillslope in british columbia in canada hutchinson and moore 2000 these studies reflect the influence of soil thickness on the hydrological process from a single watershed mcdonnell et al 1998 however the complexity of the microscale surface or bedrock topography has greatly affected the soil thickness and development of weathered bedrock banks et al 2009 mohr et al 2012 and the effects on the rainfall runoff response should be considered the threshold behaviors of rainfall and runoff are widely used because they can reflect dynamic factors such as soil moisture and precipitation characteristics which were observed in many study areas although the geological background was not consistent detty and mcguire 2010 graham et al 2010a graham et al 2010b tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 scaife and band 2017 threshold behavior is generally exhibited by the non linear relationship between rainfall and runoff when the rainfall exceeds a certain threshold the water flow path is connected and the slope of the cumulative curve of rainfall and runoff is close to 1 i e almost all rainwater is converted directly to runoff tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 tani 1997 the effect of soil thickness on threshold behavior is usually related to the soil storage capacity and the result is the slope differences calculated from the linear formula or the verification of the aforementioned non linear relationship buttle et al 2004 emphasized the dominant role of soil thickness in rainfall runoff response runoff is generated in almost all rainfall events with a thin soil layer and there was a linear relationship between runoff and rainfall runoff from the plot with thick soil layer was mainly controlled by amount of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture and there is a non linear relationship between runoff and rainfall in such cases buttle et al 2004 similarly the importance of soil thickness in determining the relationship between runoff and rainfall has been shown in other studies buttle et al 2000 lin 2006 lin and zhou 2008 threshold behavior was evaluated to clarify the runoff generation mechanism the physical condition of infiltration excess runoff is that the rainfall intensity is greater than the soil infiltration rate whereas saturation excess runoff occurs only when rainfall saturates the soil area dunne and black 1970 although threshold behavior can better reflect the hydrological connectivity of the hillslope neither direct nor indirect evidence has been sufficiently reported to determine the mechanism of rainfall runoff generation and the integration of multiple methods is conducive to further clarification of the relationship between threshold behavior and the underlying surface characteristics stable isotopes such as δd and δ18o can reflect water flow paths and moisture sources and evaluating their levels can greatly help in understanding the mechanisms that generate runoff on hillslopes rinderer et al 2018 stochinger et al 2014 von freyberg et al 2018 mcguire et al 2005 used an isotope δ18o tracer to analyze the water residence time of seven watersheds at various scales and found that topography is more influential than the watershed area in controlling the water flow movement the isotope water meteoric line and hydrograph separations can distinguish the contribution of event water and pre event water to help identify preferential flow and water recharge dai et al 2020 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b zhao et al 2016 cras et al 2007 reported that poorly developed soils and the lack of storage in the catchments led to a dominance of event water during storms however von freyberg et al 2018 showed that catchment outflow was typically dominated by pre event water soil wetness e g rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture and hydrogeological e g lithology and the structure of cz in the study area should be considered understanding these phenomena zhao et al 2013 found that the isotopic signatures demonstrated that piston and preferential flows coexist in the purple soil region of southwest china high antecedent soil water content and high rain intensity favor the formation of piston flow therefore an isotope tracer plays a significant role in indicating the mechanism of runoff generation and recharge discharge which can elucidate the effect of soil thickness in the rainfall runoff process karst landforms are known worldwide for their complex surface and subsurface topography accounting for approximately 7 12 of the earth s continental area and about one quarter of the global population is completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 karst dissolution is stronger in humid subtropical areas such as the karst region in southwest china which covers a total area of 5 4 105 km2 chen et al 2018 fu et al 2016 the carbonate rocks in this region are much older than their counterparts in southern and central europe and eastern north america and have undergone stronger petrification moreover this region is also not affected by glaciation process therefore strong and uneven chemical dissolution ensures that large areas of karst terrain are heterogeneous and fragmented furthermore abundant precipitation 1000 2000 mm annually and suitable temperature 14 24 c annually in the dominant tropical and subtropical monsoon provide natural conditions for karstification jiang et al 2014 the solubility of carbonate rocks and long term strong karstification result in broken and rugged terrain and high heterogeneity jiang et al 2014 the soil on karst hillslope is randomly districted on a small scale and influenced by micro geomorphology such as lapiaz dolines stone crevices stone gullies and karst caves these geomorphic structure features will prominently alter the hydrologic response and soil erosion processes emerging at a larger scale bonetti et al 2021 prominent environmental concerns such as rocky desertification frequent floods and droughts have been proven to be closely related to the unique karst geological structure with a thin soil layer jiang et al 2014 li et al 2019 and are now known to be key problems restricting human survival and sustainable development liu et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 however although some studies have mentioned the possible influence of soil and bedrock distribution on hydrological processes fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 the lack of independent monitoring to highlight the controlling role of soil has greatly restricted future research on the water cycle and water resources management in southwest china the premise of answering the above uncertainties is to understand the relationship of rainfall runoff in the karst hillslope in southwest china in non karst areas such as the loess platea of china and semi arid regions most of the water loss was caused by rainfall events with high rainfall intensity thunderstorm for short periods and dominant surface runoff peng and wang 2012 however subsurface runoff dominates hydrological processes on karst hillslope in southwest china fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 peng and wang 2012 zhu et al 2017 soil patches with high permeability and rocky outcrop areas with weak permeability are distributed alternately on the karst hillslope and the infiltration excess surface runoff generated can quickly penetrate the epikarst the subsurface runoff generation of a karst slope conforms to the fill and spill theory tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b studies have reached a consensus that the epikarst plays a particularly important role in the karst hydrological process which is the core region different from the non karst cz the epikarst comprises highly weathered carbonate bedrock immediately beneath the surface or the soil or exposed at the surface williams 2008 the prerequisite for subsurface runoff is water perched at the soil epikarst interface hartmann et al 2014 klimchouk 2004 parise et al 2015 williams 2008 soils have high infiltration capacity with steady infiltration from 40 to 130 mm h 1 in the karst region of southwest china chen et al 2011 which is higher than the soil epikarst interface stable infiltration rate 35 to 40 mm h 1 fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this means that the soil epikarst interface can easily generate runoff when rainfall conditions including rainfall amount and intensity are satisfied water stable isotopes were used to trace spring recharge groundwater exchange and water source identification at the small watershed scale chen et al 2018 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b a few studies have explored the rainfall runoff relationship at the hillslope scale through in situ simulation experiments fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b however although these studies explored rainfall runoff generation mechanisms their applicability remains unclear owing to a lack of natural monitoring data furthermore the mechanism of runoff generation needs to be clarified using water isotopes tracer methods such as the mixing process of event water and pre event water and the residence time of rainwater in this study natural monitoring of rainfall and runoff discharge dynamics on two adjacent karst hillslope plots with different soil thicknesses were conducted from june 2019 to december 2020 we present the following hypotheses for testing in this research due to the different soil thicknesses 1 subsurface runoff dominates hillslope hydrology but it is markedly differentiated 2 the inconsistent thresholds of rainfall runoff are caused by differences in soil water deficit and 3 the inconsistent contribution of event water to runoff is caused by differences in soil infiltration capacity our large datasets allowed us to explore the hydrological behavior of the karst hillslope and provide a scientific basis for eco hydrological processes and modeling studies in karstic landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the study site is a 1 14 km2 catchment named mulian catchment 24 43 n 108 18 e located in huanjiang county northwest guangxi province in southwest china fig 1 a the catchment is the site for long term field research by the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of science fig 1b it is a representative cockpit karst catchment developed on pure dolomite the ratios of cao and mgo in the bedrock are 30 and 20 respectively and is characterized by a flat depression surrounded by the peak of overlapping hills and ridges excluding an outlet in the northeast ford and williams 2007 fu et al 2015 elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m above sea level approximately 60 of slopes have a gradient greater than 20 this gradient was considered the threshold slopes because soil erosion indices for land slopes greater than 20 in the carbonate rock areas in southwest china exceeded the soil loss tolerance rate of 2 to 5 tons acre per year 294 to 1235 tons km2 per year in the united states hu et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 the study site has a humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 19 6 c the monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures occurred in july and february respectively the average annual rainfall is approximately 1 456 mm 1980 2013 and the average rainfall in the rainy season from may to september accounts for approximately 74 of the annual rainfall wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b our previous geophysical exploration at the catchment scale revealed that the geology comprises middle carboniferous c2 dolomite and dolomitic limestone zhang et al 2021 the soils are brown calcareous soil with a clay to clay loam texture 25 to 50 silt and 30 to 60 clay the soil thickness varies between 0 and 6 4 m but the average thickness of the slopes is approximately 30 cm and contains massive amounts of rock fragments with particle size greater than 2 mm wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b 2 2 description of experiment plot we selected two adjacent slope experimental plots separated by a space of 5 m and having a projected area of 5 20 m to perform natural monitoring fig 1c a soil drill was used to drill to the soil epikarst interface on a grid of 1 1 m and the soil depth was measured to calculate the topography for both the surface and bedrock fig 2 one plot had a shallow soil layer and the other had a relatively deep soil layer comprising the shallow soil plot ssp and deep soil plot dsp respectively fig 2 the average soil thickness of the ssp was 35 4 39 46 cm and that of the dsp was 66 0 33 26 cm the bedrock outcrop ratios in the dsp and ssp were 4 and 21 respectively the rock fragments in the dsp and ssp were 7 3 and 15 9 respectively wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b the topographic wetness index twi with 1 1 m grid was used to quantify the surface and subsurface bedrock topography the twi is calculated as follows freer et al 2002 1 twi ln α tan β where α is the upslope confluence area of unit contour length flowing through any point on the slope surface β is the local slope angle and tanβ is the slope of this point notably it is normal for twi to be negative which is attributed to the influence of microtopography on grid calculation caused by high resolution 1 1 m in this study the material of each plot was completely removed from the unweathered bedrock which had an average vertical depth of 4 m using a backhoe fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this depth reached the bedrock layer with no visible rock fractures and conduits and a steady infiltration rate of 3 mm h 1 fu et al 2015 strongly weathered product similar to the saprolite layer at the soil bedrock in non karst areas between the soil and epikarst interface was observed in dsp whereas saprolite was not observed in the ssp as shown in fig 2b concrete walls were installed deep into the epikarst surface on three sides of the plots the left right and upper edges to prevent surface runoff and soil epikarst interface runoff exchange between adjacent plots fig 1e and f the above measures can ensure that the soil layer to soil epikarst interface is isolated undisturbed soil and saprolite samples were collected to measure the soil properties we collected soil samples from both upslope and downslope areas covered with soil in addition valuable saprolite samples were collected only on the soil epikarst interface at the upslope from the dsp saturate soil hydraulic conductivity ks cm h 1 using the constant head method jia et al 2013 the disturbed soil was passed through a 1 mm sieve and was analyzed for particle sizes by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england soil and saprolite properties are shown in table 1 the permeability of dsp was lower than that of ssp 2 3 site instrumentation and hydrometric data monitoring rainfall quantities were measured using an automatic tipping bucket with a 0 1 mm resolution hobo event data logger usa at meteorological stations in the catchment fig 1a and b surface runoff from the atmosphere soil interface subsurface runoff from the soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff from the epikarst bedrock interface were measured at the outlet of the two experimental plots using a tipping bucket connected by a hosepipe and equipped with a hobo event recorder fig 1c f subsurface runoff monitoring was carried out in five flow units each with a width of 1 m and the instruments were numbered as follows ssr1 ssr2 ssr3 ssr4 and ssr5 fig 1d e the soil moisture at the start of each rainfall event was used as an index of antecedent soil moisture and was assumed to represent the experimental wetness condition from june to december 2019 we measured soil moisture before and after every rainfall event using a portable tdr probe at the same locations from december 15 2019 to october 30 2020 soil moisture was measured for 5 min per time using vertically installed 5 cm long soil moisture probes stevens hydra probe at the downslope position fig 2 2 4 water sampling and analysis rainwater was sampled with a 20 cm diameter glass funnel connected to a 1 1 high density polyethylene bottle a table tennis ball was placed in a funnel to reduce evaporation schotterer 1996 a total of 134 rainfall isotope samples were collected daily 52 and 82 samples were collected in 2019 and 2020 respectively all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and preserved at 4 c from the dsp and ssp 18 and 99 surface runoff water isotope samples were collected respectively there were 6 5 20 29 and 76 water isotope samples collected by ssr1 ssr2 ssr3 ssr4 and ssr5 in the dsp respectively and 144 146 112 137 and 41 samples were collected by ssr1 ssr2 ssr3 ssr4 and ssr5 in the ssp respectively the number of epikarst runoff water isotope samples collected from dsp and ssp were 352 and 351 respectively all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and preserved at 4 c the δ 18o and δd stable isotopes of water samples were measured using los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dlt 100 usa west et al 2010 via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy at johns hopkins university jhu following the iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 the results were reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and defined relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water as given by the following equation 2 δ d δ 18 o r sample r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d where r represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and rstandard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard form the δ value was expressed in parts per thousand permit the precision of measurement of δd was 0 5 and that of δ 18o was 0 2 at the 2σ criterion 2 5 rainfall and runoff events to analyze rainfall event rainfall events were defined as having total rainfall 5 mm and peak hourly rainfall intensity ipeak 1 5 mm h 1 distinct events were separated by greater than 12 h without rainfall saffarpour et al 2016 to assess runoff threshold behavior the surface runoff hydrograph was divided into individual events runoff events began when the stream discharge hydrograph started to rise from its initial low flow value events ended either when a new rainfall event started or 96 h after the end of a rainfall event in unusually wet situations where elevated flow continued saffarpour et al 2016 in the rainy season there were 46 and 47 surface runoff events in the dsp and ssp respectively in the dry seaon there were 7 and 8 surface runoff events in the dsp and ssp respectively the diagrams of rainfall and runoff were obtained through the approaches described by janzen and mcdonnell 2015 and detty and mcguire 2010 who considered the impact of rainfall amount rainfall intensity and soil moisture on event runoff because subsurface runoff often lasts for a long time this process is easily affected by superimposed rainfall events we defined subsurface runoff from the start of the end of runoff as a subsurface runoff event to avoid the above uncertainties in the rainy season 30 and 29 subsurface runoff events were observed in the dsp and ssp respectively no subsurface runoff was observed in the dry season 2 6 approaches for threshold output surface runoff and subsurface runoff threshold behaviors compared to rainfall was measured using a piecewise regression analysis pra pra is a broken stick model where two or more lines meet at unknown points called breakpoints these breakpoints are threshold values the segmented package in r software was used to execute the pra it estimates that breakpoints based on a maximum likelihood approach that constrains regression segments are nearly continuous wei et al 2020 in statistics a likelihood function is a function of the parameters of a statistical model when given data likelihood functions play a key role in statistical inference especially the methods for estimating a parameter from a set of statistics our previous study found no threshold responses between asi antecedent soil water and surface runoff subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff even though there were trends towards positive relationships between them wang et al 2022 therefore asi values were not considered in the value of thresholds in this study before calculating the threshold we first performed logarithmic conversion on surface runoff and subsurface runoff data this was because the runoff generated by extreme rainfall was far greater than that generated by other rainfall events and some key threshold information would have been obscured without converting data 2 7 hydrograph separation this study assumed a simple mixing of two end member event water and pre event water to quantify the mixing proportions of rainwater recharging the subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff here the hydrograph refers to the flow into each tipping bucket we used the weighted mean of the rainfall samples collected daily as the event water cevent and the isotope of subsurface runoff and epikasrt runoff of the days before as the pre event water cpre event pre event was defined as one day before the event their contributions were calculated using the following equations wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b 3 c event x event c event 1 x event c pre event where x event is the concentration of water discharge by event water if the proportion of water source was overestimated the negative estimation was excluded zhao et al 2016 specifically a proportion above 100 was recorded as 100 and a proportion below 0 was recorded as 0 zhao et al 2016 3 results 3 1 surface and bedrock topography characteristics the twi of the surface dsp 3 48 1 09 ssp 2 98 1 39 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the bedrock dsp 2 35 1 36 ssp 2 46 1 27 fig 3 the coefficient of variation cv of twi was small due to the equally flat surface of the dsp 0 31 while the cv of ssp was 0 47 the bedrock terrain was more complex than the surface terrain showing a higher cv which was 0 58 and 0 52 in the dsp and ssp respectively fig 3 the coupling degree between the surface and bedrock topography in ssp was higher than that in the dsp fig 3 based on the linear regression analysis of twi values of the surface and bedrock the surface and bedrock twi of two plots showed a significantly positive linear correlation p 0 05 the expressions of dsp and ssp were y 0 27x 1 41 n 110 r 2 0 30 p 0 05 and y 0 54x 0 87 n 110 r 2 0 34 p 0 001 respectively 3 2 runoff characteristics the runoff time series and δd values on a daily scale are shown in fig 4 the runoff showed obvious stage characteristics with high flow in the rainy season may to september and low discharge in the dry season october to april the number of rainfall runoff events in the dsp were less but the runoff amount of single events was large the total surface runoff in the dsp 91 054 l was much higher than that in the ssp 29 933 l the same result was observed in the subsurface runoff but the subsurface runoff was larger in the ssp 177 170 l than that in the dsp 138 597 l because the duration of rainfall runoff events were longer especially during the dry season with no rain fig 4 from october 17 2019 to january 17 2020 the amount of rainfall was only 13 8 mm but the discharge of the epikarst was maintained for 3 months however the ability to supply water is limited by wet conditions from march 2 to april 6 2019 i e the ending and beginning of the dry season of the rainfall amounted up to 324 6 mm but no outflow from the epikarst was observed in both the dsp and ssp the runoff component of the karst slope was mainly from the soil epikarst system including the subsurface and epiakrst runoff in both the dsp and ssp which account for 79 96 and 96 96 of the total runoff respectively epikarst contributed to most of the runoff fig 5 a and b the portion of surface runoff of the dsp 20 04 was significantly higher than that of the ssp 3 04 the surface runoff in dsp and ssp were 910 5 and 299 3 mm accounting for 31 55 and 10 37 of the total rainfall depth respectively the continuous outflow of the epikarst runoff was much higher than the rainfall amount which usually occurs in the dry season fig 5 this means that the epikarst may be connected during the outflow period forming a continuous perched saturated zone 3 3 rainwater and runoff isotope characteristics 3 3 1 isotope dynamic over the monitoring period runoff isotopes were controlled by the input rainfall isotopes the rainfall amount in the second half of 2019 and 2020 was 725 2 mm and 1626 4 mm fig 4 respectively with weighted mean of 40 33 and 51 69 for precipitation isotopes correspondingly the isotope values of each runoff component in 2019 were more positive than those in 2020 the average value of δd of the surface runoff was the lowest dsp 49 41 ssp 39 82 followed by the subsurface runoff dsp 35 77 ssp 32 50 and the largest in the epikarst runoff dsp 31 28 ssp 30 80 the results of a one way anova of the δd showed that there were significant differences between surface and subsurface runoff in the dsp and ssp respectively fig 6 b and c in contrast there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the isotope values of epikarst runoff between the dsp and ssp 3 3 2 meteoric water line mwl and hydrograph separation fig 7 shows the stable isotope values of different runoff components obtained during the sampling period plotted with the local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl had a slope of 7 29 and an intercept of 8 81 which were both lower than the slope 8 0 and the intercept 10 0 of the global mwl the slope of mwl in the dsp varies widely ranging from 5 74 to 7 31 the mwl slope of the epikarst runoff was the smallest which was within the slope range of the soil evaporation mwl 3 5 6 horita 2005 the mwl slope of the subsurface runoff is higher than that of the surface runoff on the contrary the mwl slope of the runoff components in the ssp was close to the lmwl with the slope ranging from 6 66 to 7 21 fig 7b pre event water controlled the subsurface and epikarst runoff during the monitoring period the mean proportions of pre event water in the dsp and ssp were 86 22 and 82 19 of subsurface runoff respectively which were lower than those in the epikarst runoff 98 43 and 98 21 in dsp and ssp respectively in addition event water contributions were higher for particular events and the proportion of event water in ssp was higher than that in dsp fig 8 b and c for example a total rainfall of 777 9 mm was measured from september 7 to october 2020 the average contribution of event in the dsp and ssp were 17 18 and 29 55 respectively comparatively the mean proportion of event water in the epikarst was 5 73 and 10 56 respectively 3 4 rainfall runoff threshold behavior a non linear relationship was observed both in the dsp and ssp in the rainy season which indicated notable threshold behavior in rainfall and surface runoff on karst slopes the rainfall amount ranged from 5 2 to 335 0 mm with 1 h maximum rainfall intensities mri ranging from 2 4 to 77 6 mm 1 during the rainy season fig 9 a and b the rainfall amount threshold of surface runoff generation in dsp was higher than that in ssp which were 44 7 mm and 39 5 mm respectively a significant linear relationship between runoff and mri was observed in both the dsp and ssp but dsp had a higher explanatory for runoff volume however compared to the rainy season there was no threshold behavior on surface runoff in the dry season and rainfall and surface runoff showed a significantly positive linear relationship fig 9c and d threshold behavior was also observed in the subsurface runoff and there was a significant non linear relationship between rainfall amounts for both dsp and ssp fig 10 the rainfall threshold of subsurface runoff in the dsp 91 0 mm was higher than that in the ssp 79 4 mm and it was more affected by soil moisture linear regression shows that the correlation between soil moisture and subsurface runoff in the dsp r 2 0 56 p 0 01 was considerably higher than that in the ssp r 2 0 20 p 0 05 4 discussion previous studies have shown that the spatial distribution of soil thickness partially determines the water storage capacity and flow path of the hillslope and significantly affects hydrological connectivity and runoff generation burt and mcdonnell 2015 however our understanding of runoff contributions from hillslopes is based on studies conducted in steep landscapes with thin soils burt and mcdonnell 2015 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 here we discuss and provide explanations summarized by a conceptual diagram for the effect of soil thickness on the structure and runoff characteristics of the karst cz 4 1 runoff characteristics on karst slope under different soil thickness based on the monitoring of runoff generation at different interfaces surface runoff at the atmosphere soil interface subsurface runoff at the soil epikarst interface and epikarst runoff at the epikarst bedrock interface this study revealed that surface runoff was relatively minimal whereas subsurface runoff was predominant in the karst slope the relatively small surface runoff on the karst slope can be attributed to its saturated excess generation mechanism wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this result could be generalized to the entire karst slope area of southwest china as it is consistent with the lower surface runoff coefficients reported in previous studies chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 zhu et al 2017 the surface runoff of the hillslope with thick soil was higher than that of the slope with shallow soil fig 4 many previous studies have shown that surface runoff increases with increased soil depth buttle et al 2000 buttle et al 2004 lin 2006 lin and zhou 2008 woolhiser et al 2006 fu et al 2011 this observation is related to the mechanism of runoff generation determined by the soil thickness buttle et al 2000 summarized that infiltration excess runoff is the main runoff generation in bedrock outcrops while macropore preferential flow dominates the soil bedrock interface runoff in shallow soil areas similar results were found in the shale hills watershed and lin 2006 suggest that preferential flow was more likely to be generated in shallow soil than in thick soil areas the above view was confirmed by the higher permeability of the ssp than that of the dsp table 1 in this study the runoff in the epikarst system including lateral soil epikarst runoff and lateral epikarst bedrock runoff dominates the total runoff of karst hillslopes these two types of flow are not consistent at spatial and temporal scales the lateral soil bedrock interface runoff is temporary which is mainly attributed to the high randomness of the preferential flow of fractures in karst areas leading to the rapid vertical infiltration of water into the epikarst bedrock interface two reasons can account for the higher proportion of lateral soil epikarst runoff in ssp in southwest karst hillslopes soil water storage capacity may be less important than in non karst areas due to the prevalence of vertical preferential flow paths e g dolines funnels and bedrock fractures and pipelines wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b xu et al 2020 secondly bedrock outcrops which are hard and have low permeability generally exist in ssp which is conducive to water accumulation leading to greater saturation of the soil bedrock interface and generated lateral runoff in addition the greater evapotranspiration in dsp is one of the major reasons for the lower proportion of lateral soil epikarst runoff in the ssp ben yona et al 2020 compared the hydrologic processes of two similarly sized watersheds and found that the doubled annual precipitation in a karstic watershed generates an annual streamflow that is five times more than that in the basaltic watershed a larger fraction of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration at the basaltic watershed and a larger portion of the rainfall percolates to the epikarst through preferential flow and appears as baseflow at the karstic watershed this indicates that karst hillslopes with deep soil are more similar to non karst features in hydrological processes which is related to the degree of karst dissolution our catchment scale geophysical findings suggest that dolomite weathering may be less severe than previously thought which confirms the necessity of noting the effects of bedrock weathering even on catchments with the same lithology such as limestone and dolomite when monitoring hydrological processes zhang et al 2021 epikarst runoff is a crucial component of the karst slope water budget with a longer runoff duration than other runoff components fig 5c and d for example at the end of the rainy season in 2020 although there was no effective rainfall event for two months october to december the epikarst continued to flow out fig 4 however in terms of experimental design the epikarst cannot be isolated due to the limited experimental means it may be necessary to separate the epikarst runoff when calculating the rainfall runoff response balance on karst hillslopes fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 previous studies have strongly emphasized the important role of epikarst in regulating the distribution of karst water resources according to mangin 1973 the epikarstic aquifer is a perched saturated zone within the superficial part of the karst that stores a part of the infiltrated water the epikarst overlies the infiltration zone itself which is intersected by occasional enlarged vertical fractures and karst conduits thus the base of the epikarst acts as an aquitard and may contain a local perched water table which could be the so called epikarstic aquifer hartmann et al 2014 therefore the epikarst acts like a water tank providing a continuous supply of mobile water in both dsp and ssp fig 3 the absence of significant differences between the isotope values of epikarst runoff of two plots explain the water tank effect fig 6 however flow monitoring alone may not be enough to reflect the effect of soil thickness on epikarst runoff because the epikarst of the two experimental plots are in the same saturated layer 4 2 soil thickness controls the relationship between topography and runoff when surface runoff is generated by infiltration excess soil thickness will not necessarily be the main factor controlling the surface topography and runoff nevertheless it rarely happens that the intensity of rainfall events exceeds the soil infiltration capacity wang et al 2018 therefore soil thickness is the first order factor that controls runoff generation most of the time detty and mcguire 2010 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 nadal romero et al 2018 however most studies on the relationship between soil thickness topography and runoff have focused on the watershed scale jencso et al 2010 jencso et al 2010 found that surface topography directly influences hydraulic gradients which means that the relationship between micro topography and hydrological processes is also worth paying attention to this spatial heterogeneity is the basic feature of karst czs that distinguish them from non karst cz in this context deeper soils would be expected to have higher storage capacities than steeper watersheds with thinner soils which leads to a more sensitive response of ssp to rainfall fig 4 however regardless of dsp or ssp surface runoff accounts for only a small part of the total runoff therefore more attention should be paid to the influence of bedrock topography on runoff subsurface runoff is specifically related to the bedrock topography which is further determined by the soil thickness a significant negative linear relationship between subsurface runoff and twi was observed in the ssp but no linear relationship was observed in the dsp fig 11 which indicates that bedrock twi can be used to predict subsurface runoff in the shallow soil slope in the karst area this is consistent with the results of the study by fu et al 2016 who found that more than 70 of the total rainfall water moved vertically through the shallow soil layer perched on the highly irregular epikarst surface and was then redistributed by the epikarst system because subsurface flow occurred on the soil epikarst interface depressions were filled on the epikarst surface and water was held by the epikarst and deep percolation fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 however the mechanism of runoff generation in the dsp may require further explanation though observational or simulated experiments in addition to the above differences in runoff generation mechanism and rainfall buffer capacity the structure of the cz under the influence of soil thickness cannot be ignored our previous survey on geological drilling at the watershed scale zhang et al 2021 and profile scale investigations fig 2 revealed that the interface between deep soil and bedrock generally forms a soil saprolite interface with a low permeability coefficient table 1 however the shallow soil was directly connected to the weathered bedrock with widespread fissures fig 2b the study by banks et al 2009 indicated that saprolite has a lower permeability than the underlying fractured bedrock this means that the existence of saprolite will directly determine the soil bedrock lateral runoff and perched water level harr 1977 and graham et al 1997 reported that saprolite may not be present in some mountainous environments which is supported by observations in many mountainous regions where bedrock outcrops dominate the landscape due to the frequent outcropping of bedrock in the karst area of southwest china jiang et al 2014 the influence of this composite structure on hydrological processes warrants further exploration in this study the soil depth varies greatly even within small plots which indicates the multi interface and randomness of the hydrological process on the karst hillslopes of southwest china we also monitored and analyzed the rainfall runoff relationship in the remaining plots 12 experimental plots with different types of vegetation wang et al 2022 the result showed that soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on surface runoff when considered rock fragments root depth soil depth and bedrock outcrops by using the structural equation model this demonstrates that the variability of soil depth is an unavoidable problem from the perspective of hydrological model whether the hydrological models are distributed lumped or semi distributed lumped in karst areas the primary consideration is the characterization of structures hartmann et al 2014 hartmann et al 2017 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 however although the existing eco hydrological modes have been considerably developed it is difficult to quantify the geotechnical structures of the karst watershed such as the soil and epikarst due to the complexity of the karst cz xu et al 2020 the earth s cz emphasizes interdisciplinary and scales integration geophysical exploration and computerized deep learning have been applied in the karst area to provide methodological support for the quantification of cz structures showing great developmental prospects in combination with the models chen et al 2018 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 secondly most hydrological models especially those created at large scales deal with soil thickness estimates using empirical equations including those for evaluating transfer functions therefore identifying the factors controlling soil thickness variation such as bedrock outcrop and elevation and slope is a key step as some factors can be detected by remote sensing methods which facilitates cross spatial integration 4 3 soil thickness controls the isotopes of runoff components stable isotopes of water have been widely used to provide insight into the functioning of karst systems chen et al 2018 mudarra and andreo 2011 in the present study the water stable isotopes supported our previous explanation of the mechanism of surface and subsurface runoff generation in particular the effect of soil thickness in the epikarst has also been captured by isotope signals under the same steady state evaporation condition the main distinction between the relationship between runoff water and δd δ18o in saturated and unsaturated conditions is that the slope of the unsaturated evaporation line tends to decrease this is because as the evaporation front moves down the water vapor above the front is diffused and transported more intensively which makes the kinetic fractionation increasingly important bernes and allison 1988 based on this we believe that the temporary stagnant layer in the dsp under the influence of saprolite leads to saturated subsurface runoff in addition the low permeability of the saprolite prevents water infiltration which leads to unsaturated runoff in epikasrt and is more susceptible to evaporation therefore we observed that the slope of the water meteoric line in the epikarst runoff was close to the soil evaporation line horita 2005 notably this does not necessarily indicate that the stable isotopes in epikarst runoff had experienced evaporative fractionation instead this may indicate surface water and subsurface water interactions in this low lying humid basin floor dai et al 2020 the mwl slope of each runoff component in the ssp are close to each other which means that the mixing effect of each water pool is relatively sufficient the contribution of pre event water to event water confirmed the above results that is the proportion of event rainwater in subsurface runoff and epikarst runoff in ssp was higher than that in dsp pre event water has been reported to dominate the storm hydrograph in most natural humid systems klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the results support this conclusion in the present study area wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b found that pre event water contributed to 89 5 and 93 4 of the volume of the two springs during the wet season we found that event water contributions were higher for particular events in both the dsp and ssp this is consistent with the results of cras et al 2007 who observed that at peak flow 100 of the hydrograph was comprised of event water during hydrograph recession pre event water contributions increased to 40 and up to 90 of streamflow volume poorly developed soils together with the lack of storage in the catchments led to the dominance of event water during storms cras et al 2007 this also explains why the proportion of event water in the ssp is higher than that in the dsp however isotope hydrograph studies focusing on precipitation events in karst region are rare wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b therefore to deepen the understanding of karst hydrological processes subsequent studies need to analyze the isotope hydrograph of rainstorm processes at the intra event scale 4 4 soil thickness controls rainfall runoff relationships hydrologists have found that the threshold behavior of runoff generation at the hillslope and catchment scales in humid regions saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the phenomenon of qualitative change with the increase in flow and rainfall amount essentially reflects the connection of fast water delivery channels saffarpour et al 2016 significant threshold effects were observed during the rainy season in both the dsp and ssp fig 9 similar catchment wetness thresholds for connectivity and runoff generation have been reported in other studies detty and mcguire 2010 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the threshold values of the rainfall amount in the dsp and ssp was 44 7 and 39 5 mm respectively the rainfall threshold for the surface runoff initiation determined in the present study fell within the range of previously published data ali et al 2015 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 our simulated rainfall experiment results showed that the rainfall intensity threshold must be larger than the steady infiltration rate of the soil epikarst interface which was the prerequisite for the saturation of the epikarst surface depression and soil layer a steady soil epikarst infiltration rate was estimated 40 mm h 1 according to the surface runoff generation mechanism wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b our previous study based on simulated rainfall monitoring showed that the rainfall intensity threshold of karst slope surface runoff was 40 mm h 1 which is approximately equal to the stable infiltration rate of the epikarst wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b this study also proved that the simulation results were suitable for natural monitoring the larger threshold in dsp indicates that the soil layer can store more water before surface runoff generates it according to the results of the study by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the threshold values for subsurface runoff generation was 55 mm and larger values were observed in this study for both dsp and ssp fig 10 this is attributed to the highly soil permeable capacity in karst areas when the rainfall amount exceeded this threshold value the storm runoff increased linearly with rainfall amount the threshold of runoff in the dsp was higher than that in the ssp which means that subsurface runoff may also be influenced by soil moisture this study found a significant linear relationship between rainfall intensity and surface runoff a similar finding regarding the role of intensity was reported by janzen and mcdonnell 2015 who found that the panola hillslope can produce significant runoff from dry antecedent conditions when high intensity rainfall occurs in contrast the surface runoff in ssp is less affected by rainfall intensity and is related to a higher permeability coefficient scaife et al 2020 found that maximum rainfall intensity did not contribute to fast flow in forested catchments and was attributed to highly conductive forest soils some studies have also reported these results in site with humid temperate and very high soil hydraulic conductivity capacities which indicates that maximum rainfall intensity had little impact on surface runoff generation ali et al 2015 graham et al 2010a graham et al 2010b tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 in contrast the surface runoff in the dry season was not related to the rainfall intensity but was affected by soil moisture typical high intensity rainfall is mostly generated during the rainy season so the probability of infiltration exceed is low wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b conversely soil moisture in the dry season determines whether the conditions of saturated infiltration runoff production can be achieved fu et al 2016 as expected subsurface runoff in the dsp was more susceptible to the influence of wetness conditions because the soil moisture contributes more to subsurface runoff variability fig 10 similar results were obtained from our previous simulation of rainfall in the dsp fu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 these results support those of previous studies that demonstrated a linearly increasing stormflow response with greater p precipitation or p asi antecedent soil moisture precipitation after a well defined threshold reflecting soil moisture storage characteristics hillslope drainage efficiency saturated area connectivity and runoff generation processes detty and mcguire 2010 graham et al 2010a graham et al 2010b penna et al 2011 scaife and band 2017 scaife et al 2020 in the ssp rainfall features had a higher priority on runoff than in the dsp this may be due to the high conductivity of soil and the enhanced porosity and permeability of the epikarst zone and bedrock outcrops in the ssp hartmann et al 2021 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 and detty and mcguire 2010 reported that topography is the main factor influencing water redistribution in shallow soil hillslope although the thin soil layer may become saturated during rainfall events vertical bypass flow through visible sub vertical fissures conduits or caves delivers excess water vertically to the epikarst thus soil moisture was considered to have a relative effect on subsurface runoff in ssp we constructed a conceptual model for runoff components that were dependent on the different soil thicknesses in a karst slope and integrated our results over two representative profiles fig 12 in the present study water deficit determines that the rainfall threshold of surface runoff is higher 44 mm vs 39 mm in experimental plots with larger soil thickness rainwater rapidly infitrates the shallow soil layer and is converted into subsurface runoff via preferential flow yielding minimal surface runoff 3 the soil thickness determines the soil and bedrock structure of the cz of the karst hillslope that is whether there is saprolite underneath the soil layer the permeability of saprolite is much lower than the soil layer and as rainwater seeps from the surface it creates a perched saturated zone where the mwl of mobile water remains close to the lmwl saprolite also prevents or delays the exchange between surface runoff and soil epikarst interface runoff which contributes to a lower proportion of event water in contrast the flow path of the shallow soil layer was not affected or was only slightly affected by the saprolite therefore the runoff components are relatively mixed and the proportion of event water in subsurface runoff was higher this conceptual model emphasizes the controlling effect of soil thickness on the cz structure and hydrological process in karst hillslope and provides new insight into the eco hydrological process and the construction of models it also provides a theoretical and practical basis for water resource management and control at the watershed scale 5 conclusion we linked soil thickness to the cz structure and explored its influence on the relationship between rainfall and runoff 1 surface runoff is relatively rare and has a short duration while subsurface runoff is a universal characteristic of karst areas the epikarst is a crucial component of the karst slope that controls runoff and epikarst runoff spans a longer duration which indicates the critical role of this zone in flow regulation functions storage and release functions of the karst hydrologic systems 2 soil thickness controls runoff composition which is highlighted by the finding that the ssp slope yields less surface runoff and more subsurface runoff the surface and bedrock topography are highly coupled in the ssp and a significant linear relationship between subsurface runoff and bedrock topography in the ssp was observed these findings suggest that soil thickness mainly affected the surface runoff in dsp but the subsurface runoff in ssp 3 significant threshold behavior was observed in surface runoff and subsurface runoff both in dsp and ssp this threshold behavior is of great significance for water resources management and control in the karst region of southwest china as flood disasters occur frequently in this region 4 saprolite acts as a buffer and reduces the seepage of water from the soil to the epikarst the mixing degree of runoff components in the ssp and the contribution proportion of event water from rainfall events were higher it is helpful in understanding the role of the epikarst in hydrological regulation and water storage in the karst cz credit authorship contribution statement jun zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft investigation sheng wang
