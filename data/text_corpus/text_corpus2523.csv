and complex intermediate products which results in serious environmental and health risks for the cartap containing wastewater however there are few studies on the treatment of cartap bearing wastewater herein we prepared the catalyst by using γ al2o3 as a support loaded by single metal cu fe co through the dipping sedimentation method then we characterized the catalysts by x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps considering the treatment efficiency experimental conditions and cost reductions co γ al2o3 was found to be the best catalyst results demonstrated that the co γ al2o3 catalyst has thermal stability sintering resistance and a certain mechanical strength the optimum experimental conditions were as follows ph 6 microwave power 300 w h2o2 dosage 0 2 ml and catalyst dosage 0 5 g based on these experimental results we proposed plausible degradation pathways for cartap removal by microwave responsive catalysts technology keywords cartap microwave responsive catalysts co γ al2o3 data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction due to rapid increase in the agricultural production pollution of water resources caused by mass production and abuse of pesticides is becoming serious day by day 1 the pollutants are mainly chemical in nature they can be classified into two major categories one is inorganic nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous which are responsible for eutrophication and the other is organic pollutants 2 organic contaminants like cartaps are one of the most poisonous and harmful water pollutants 3 cartap bis thiocarbamate derivative of 2 dimethylamino propane 1 3 dithiol 4 is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker that acts primarily on pests by conversion to nereistoxin due to its high insecticidal activity it finds regular applications in the pest control of grain vegetable and fruit in countries like china japan and korea it is one of the most frequently used pesticides for pest control 5 however cartap has been identified as a toxic pollutant that induces endocrine disruption neurotoxicity and may affect carbon and nitrogen fixation of cyanobacteria 6 and has high health risk if ingested 7 in order to prevent further accumulation of cartap along with its hydrolysis and decomposition products in aquatic environments and for destruction of these contaminants in water removal of them from water is necessary in order to make degradation of cartap in the wastewater many research was done 8 10 however these studies are mainly depended on the fenton process such as mark s study 8 and ming s study 10 resulting the lower cartap s removal what s more hoang s research 9 combined advanced oxidation and electro fenton process highly increase the removal of cartap in wastewater however the technology also has limitation due to recalcitrant intermediates due to these disadvantages we try to find the best technology to remove cartap various processes such as adsorption coagulation flocculation fenton process photocatalytic oxidation wet oxidation and supercritical water oxidation have been studied or used for the elimination of pesticides from wastewater streams 11 16 all the above mentioned processes have their own advantages and disadvantages in the recent years advanced catalytic oxidation technology has gained more and more attention 17 and the technology has made remarkable progress in the field of wastewater treatment 18 however the technology has drawbacks regarding relatively harsh reaction conditions along with prominent investment and operation costs hence researchers have shifted their attention towards alternative technologies in this regard microwave technology has received significant attention for the treatment of gaseous aqueous and solid wastes 19 20 microwaves provide fast heating process and thus becoming energy and money saving by shortening synthesis time 21 22 besides microwave heating can selectively degrade organic pollutants with high efficiency 23 however the limitation of this technology is that microwave is often used in combination with other technologies like in the presence of catalysts oxidants or other advanced oxidation technologies 24 26 vieira et al reported that microwave irradiation in conjugation with a catalyst is a feasible and rapid method for the treatment of textile wastewater resulting in improved rate of toc removal as well as reduction of phytotoxicity 25 anshuman et al achieved efficient treatment of wastewater employing a hybrid system of catalyst and microwave irradiation and the obtained results showed more than 88 dye degradation after 20 min of microwave treatment at 120 c 24 xue et al demonstrated that microwave assisted catalysis can lead to effective enhancement in the rate of degradation rate of organic compounds in the aqueous phase and can be potentially employed to a variety of engineering applications 27 their work combined microwave heating technology with a catalyst and thus providing a practical approach towards energy efficient reutilization of waste polymers and rapid purification of organic pollutants 28 all the above discussions suggested that a combination of microwave mw treatment and advanced oxidation process aop can

pave the way towards promotion of the industrial application of microwave technology early catalytic oxidation processes used precious metals such as pt rh ru and pd as catalysts in the presence of other elements as active components as support the method showed high activity good selectivity long service life and no secondary pollution 29 however high cost scarcity of sources are challenges associated with the practical application of precious metal as catalysts along with the possible poisoning of active components so recent research has started to focus on non precious metals herein we used cu fe and co as the active components of low costs catalyst along with γ al2o3 as the carrier material to design a non toxic catalyst which could be an efficient solution for the treatment of wastewater containing cartap 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents cu no3 2 3h2o fe no3 3 9h2o and co no3 2 6h2o sinopharm group chemical reagent co ltd γ al2o3 saen chemical technology

used were of analytical grade 2 2 simulated wastewater preparation with cartap a certain amount of cartap was weighed in a volumetric flask and then was diluted to 1 l volume with deionized water to obtain the simulated wastewater required for the experiment and was used as required the cod content of the simulated wastewater was varying between 770 mg l 1 to 800 mg l 1 according to various measurements 2 3 synthesis of catalysts the catalysts were prepared by ultrasonic impregnation calcination method 30 we mainly added active ions onto materials by dipping ultrasonic treatment and high temperature calcination steps first certain amounts of γ al2o3 was added into aqueous solutions containing cu no3 2 or fe no3 3 or co no3 2 and then stirred for 1 2 min at room temperature for mixing them evenly it was followed by ultrasonic treatment of the solution 30 31 at 20 c for certain duration after which it was transferred to oven for drying after drying the products were put into a muffle furnace and were roasted at a constant temperature over a period after cooling they were taken out for grinding and sieved between the mesh sizes 80 and 100 to obtain cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 catalysts 2 4 mv aops experiments 100 ml simulated wastewater was taken in an erlenmeyer flask ph was adjusted with dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide appropriate amounts of catalyst and hydrogen peroxide were added and then the microwave equipment was put on at different powers after irradiation with microwaves the solution was taken out from the microwave and allowed to cool in room temperature subsequently the supernatant was filtered cod measurement was carried out the change in cod content reflected the removal of cartap percentage from the wastewater 2 5 analytical methods of the catalysts characterization of the synthesized catalyst was carried out using x ray diffraction xrd dhg 9030a scanning electron microscopy sem d8 advance hd transmission

decompose oxidized substances in water and then according to the amounts of residual oxidants to calculate the relative oxygen consumption what s more we think that there s no extra organic matter input in our experimental period the cod s residual is equal to cartap s residual thus we choose cod to measure cartap s residual 5 ml wastewater was transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe digestion tank in the digestion tank little mercury sulfate was added as masking agent along with potassium dichromate solution and sulfuric acid silver sulfate catalyst then the digestion tank was placed evenly in the microwave digestion apparatus and high microwave power was used to carry out the digestion after the digestion is completed the solution from the digestion tank was allowed to cool and then poured into an erlenmeyer flask then indicator was added in the titration and it was titrated against standard ferrous ammonium sulfate solution the cod was calculated according to the following equation cod cr v 0 v 1 c 8 1000 v 2 where v0 and v1 are the volumes of ferrous ammonium sulfate consumed by blank water sample and wastewater sample ml respectively v2 is the volume of wastewater taken for analysis ml whereas c is the concentration of standard ferrous ammonium sulfate solution mol l 1 the digestion experiments were carried out in duplicate and average value from both the measurement was taken as the cod value 2 5 2 recovery and reuse of the catalyst in the reusability test the catalyst after the reaction was filtered thoroughly washed with deionized water and then dried at 80 c overnight to be reused under the same experimental conditions the reusability experiments were conducted for four cycles catalyst metal leaching experiment after cartap degradation we took 10 ml solutions from the reaction system and then filtered with 0 22 μm membrane then we detected the concentration of cu2 fe3 and co2 in the solutions by icp ms 3 results and discussion 3 1 factors influencing the performance of γ al2o3 supported single metal catalyst 3 1 1 concentration of active component in the catalyst fig 1 demonstrates the effect of concentration of metal ions impregnated in al2o3 on the removal of cod the trend was initial increase in the degradation rate followed by a decrease when then concentration of the metal ions was continuously increased because γ al2o3 carrier has a large specific surface area it exhibits high catalytic activity when the loading amount of active components is lower than its surface saturation value if the active load exceeds a certain amount agglomeration of the active components may take place with the carrier causing the particle size to increase and the specific surface area to decrease which affect the catalytic activity 32 fig 1 shows higher catalytic activity of co γ al2o3 compared to the other three metals and the optimum concentration for cu fe co was found to be 0 3 mol l 1 0 3 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 respectively 3 1 2 immersion time fig 2 demonstrates the effect of immersion time on the performance of catalyst from fig 2 we can find that the removal rate increased with initial increase of the immersion time but with further increase of immersion time the removal rate started decreasing slightly this may be due to the generation of ultrasonic cavitation effect in the impregnating solution in the presence of ultrasonic waves the strong shock wave results in the formation of a huge pressure on the surface and pores of the catalyst which results in the pressing of the impregnating solution into the pores of the carrier γ al2o3 in large quantities with diffusion of the active components into the pores with increasing microwave immersion time active components on the surface of γ al2o3 carrier become refined and dense and the dispersion becomes uniform this results in increasing specific surface area of the catalyst which is conducive to the adsorption activation and reaction of reactant molecules on the catalyst surface leading to improved activity of the catalyst however with continuous increase of immersion time increase of local high temperature and high pressure caused poor mechanical properties of the catalyst and a small part of pulverization leading to slight decrease in catalytic activity it was observed that co γ al2o3 shows higher removal rate compared to the others with the optimum immersion time for cu fe co being 90 min 90 min and 130 min respectively 3 1 3 calcination temperature fig 3 demonstrates the effect of calcination temperature on the performance of the catalyst the results showed that with increasing calcination temperature the cod removal rate was increased the maximum removal rate of cod for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 co γ al2o3 was observed at 400 c 500 c and 400 c respectively and then a slow fall off for all the three catalysts the potential reason being incomplete conversion of the loaded components into active components at low calcination temperature and thus they will occupy surface of the carrier leading to reduced adsorption by the carrier with increasing temperature the removal rate increases due to increase in active points but above a certain temperature the active points start to agglomerate thus reducing the specific surface area which affects the catalyst performance 3 1 4 calcination time as can be seen in fig 4 with increasing calcination time there is an increase in the removal rate followed by a decrease after certain calcination time this phenomenon is probably because too short calcination time will result in less number of active components and the carrier γ al2o3 is not closely combined leading to immature crystal growth of the catalyst if the calcination time is too long the catalyst particles will agglomerate of sinter and the particles will become longer reducing the ratio of the catalyst therefore proper calcination time is conducive to the formation of many micropores on the surface of γ al2o3 by the active components thus increasing its surface area and improving the catalytic activity it was observed from the figure that the appropriate calcination times for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 catalysts were 3 5 h 4 5 h and 4 5 h respectively 3 2 factors affecting the microwave catalytic oxidation treatment of cartap containing wastewater 3 2 1 ph ph value of the wastewater is one of the important factors of the microwave catalytic oxidation process the results are presented in fig 5 from which it can be seen that increasing ph value results in increasing removal of cod followed by a decrease when the ph was increased from 2 to 5 there was gradual increase in the cod removal rate with the removal rates of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 increasing from 45 72 and 48 75 to 55 85 and 63 69 respectively beyond ph 5 the cod removal rate began to decrease for co γ al2o3 the trend in the change of cod removal rate was similar to that of the other two but the catalytic effect was significantly better than that of the other two with wider range of ph adaptation the optimum ph of co γ al2o3 was 6 at which the removal rate could reach 69 29 when ph was lower than 4 excessive h present in the system has a sweeping effect on oh which destroys the conversion balance of metal oxides loaded on γ al2o3 thereby inhibiting the catalysis of h2o2 30 therefore the cod removal rate is low with increasing ph of the solution metal ions and h2o2 combined easily to produce a large number of oh with strong oxidizing ability which is responsible for the decomposition of macromolecular organic matter in wastewater into small molecular substances and thereby improving the effect of microwave catalytic oxidation with further increase in ph value metal ions are likely to form precipitates or complexes which hinder the combination of metal ions and h2o2 resulting in reduced decomposition of h2o2 so that the generation of oh is inhibited and the oxidation ability is reduced resulting in poor catalytic effect in conclusion the degradation process shows the optimum oxidation efficiency under acidic or neutral conditions because it may present a scavenging effect of free radicals under alkaline conditions 33 3 2 2 microwave power from fig 6 microwave power was found to have significant effect on the removal of cod with initial increase of microwave power resulting in increasing rate of removal with further increase after a certain value resulting in decreasing rate of removal for all the three catalysts cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 maximum removal rate was observed at 300 w with further increase of the microwave power the removal rate began to decrease it seemed that increasing mw power facilitates the production of oh and the removal of pollutants within certain limits 34 the potential reason is that the number of active sites on the catalyst surface increases with increasing power the number of oh generated by the action of microwaves which greatly increases the collision frequency of organic molecules in the wastewater and makes the molecular bonding more likely to break thus facilitating the degradation of organic compounds in the wastewater when microwave power continues to increase the excessive temperature may lead to partial decomposition of h2o2 into o2 and h2o which is not conducive to the generation of oh and the catalytic effect decreases 3 2 3 microwave irradiation time fig 7 shows that for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 the removal percentage of the cod was enhanced with increasing microwave irradiation time from 3 min to 10 min to increase from 48 56 54 72 and 59 12 to 66 69 72 65 and 73 65 respectively when the microwave irradiation time reached 7 8 min there was no further significant increase of the removal rate this indicates that under this condition most of the organic matter in the wastewater was degraded with no further significant change in the concentration of organic matter in the solution although further increase of the microwave irradiation time can improve the treatment effect it will lead to an increase in the energy consumption and operating costs 3 2 4 h2o2 dosage the effect of h2o2 dosage on cod removal is illustrated in fig 8 the trend observed for continuously increasing h2o2 dosage was similar to that observed for other parameters mentioned in above figures with the degradation rate increasing initially followed by a slight decrease after certain dosage the reason is that under the action of microwave catalytic conversion of h2o2 to oh takes place which promotes the degradation of organic matter but excessive dosage will produce excessive h2o2 which will capture the oh generated in the system and thereby preventing organic matter from adsorbing on the surface of catalyst this will inhibit the organic matter degradation and prevent part of oh from being effectively used at the same time it will also promote the self polymerization of the generated oh radicals to regenerate h2o2 resulting in decreased production of oh therefore the optimal h2o2 dosages for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 were 0 20 ml 0 25 ml and 0 25 ml respectively 3 2 5 catalyst dosage fig 9 shows the effect of catalytic dosage on the removal rate of cod the figure showed that optimum dosage of co γ al2o3 and fe γ al2o3 was 0 5 g while for cu γ al2o3 it was 0 6 g the reason is that microwave radiation produces many hot spots on the uneven surface of the catalyst with increasing catalyst dosage the hot spots increase and at the same time the collision probability of h2o2 and active sites also increases thereby promoting the production of oh and consequently accelerating the reaction rate as the reaction reaches equilibrium effect of the catalyst is minimal the existence of too many active sites produces a large amount of oh within a short time and some of the oh decays or disappears before it can react with the organic matter resulting in a slight decrease of the removal efficiency 3 3 characterization and analysis 3 3 1 xrd spectra fig 10 a c depicts the xrd patterns of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 the characteristic peaks of cuo exhibited peaks at 2θ 35 543 38 708 48 716 61 335 and 66 248 the peak is narrow and the crystallinity of the catalyst surface is high but the dispersion is not uniform which makes the catalyst activity low fig 10 b shows characteristic peaks of γ al2o3 at 2θ 33 279 and 67 196 the sample showed diffraction peaks of fe2o3 at 2θ 35 684 and 53 852 indicating that the active components of the catalyst exist in the form of fe2o3 in fig 10 c there are more characteristic diffraction peaks of γ al2o3 crystals and the peaks of the active components are relatively high and low indicating that the active components are highly dispersed on the carrier 3 3 2 sem the morphology of the synthesized samples was examined from the sem micrographs with the typical sem micrographs of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 being shown in fig 11 a c the larger block or sheet structure is due to the γ al2o3 having a relatively smooth surface while the smaller particles on the surface are due to the active components of the load fig 11 a shows cuo grains have large particle size and sintering phenomenon which reduces the activity of cu γ al2o3 fig 11 b shows small particle size of the active particles which increases the specific surface area but some agglomerated particles still exist meantime the surface of the catalyst is partially indented and it was uneven distribution of the surface load and heating during the calcination process causing the collapse and thus affecting the catalytic activity fig 11 c indicates that a large number of active particles are dispersed on the surface of the co γ al2o3 and the dispersion of active components on the surface of the carrier is relatively uniform but there are also a small number of agglomerated particles 3 3 3 tem fig 12 a c shows the tem micrographs of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 respectively most of the cu γ al2o3 was found to be rod shaped which is similar to the γ al2o3 with 20 50 nm being the average length from fig 12 b fe γ al2o3 was seen to be spherical with relatively rough edges of the particles it may be due to the crystalline form of some active ingredients but the dispersion was not uniform it can be seen from fig 12 c that co γ al2o3 was in the shape of slender rod with a particle length of about 20 50 nm and the active ingredient showing high degree of dispersion on the carrier 3 3 4 xps xps analysis was carried out to gain further insights into the surface compositions of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 the spectrum of cu 2p fig 13a was deconvoluted into three peaks these peaks of cu 2p at 933 9 ev cu 2p3 2 953 7 ev cu 2p1 2 and 943 0 ev cu 2p3 2 revealed that the main state of cu species in the catalysts was cu2 35 the spectrum of fe 2p and co 2p were just deconvoluted into one peak fig 13b revealed that fe 2p core level spectra of fe γ al2o3 deconvoluted into one characteristic peak at binding energy 710 8 ev corresponding to 2p3 2 which was attributed to fe3 chemical state 36 indicating that the iron exists in the form of fe2o3 in co 2p spectrum the observed peak of co 780 0 ev could be attributed to co 2p3 2 which indicated that the co element on the surface of co γ al2o3 was attributed to co2 chemical state 37 3 4 catalyst recovery and reuse as can be seen from fig 14 for the catalysts cu γ al2o3 and fe γ al2o3 the removal rates were 72 32 and 74 52 respectively in the first cycle after reusing it for three times the respective rate of degradation decreased to 45 69 and 50 23 the declining degradation rate may be due to the continuous dissolution and consumption of active ingredients during the recovery process the removal rate for co γ al2o3 decreased from 78 10 to 45 66 after four times of reuse with a decrease of only 32 44 it s due to the catalyst aggregate particles increased after repeated calcination so as to reduce the catalytic performance however the overall catalytic effect of co γ al2o3 was found to be higher than the others indicating that the catalyst has certain stability and reusability which can reduce the cost of wastewater treatment what s more we still focused on the catalyst metal leaching performance during our experiments then we found that cu and fe ions leaching concentration were much higher than co ion which seemed that co element could be coupled with γ al2o3 much more closely and showed good catalytic performance 4 conclusions over the years microwave assisted advanced oxidation processes have gained increasing interest in wastewater treatment and have developed rapidly to degrade pollutants as innovative treatment approaches 33 in this study γ al2o3 supported monometallic catalysts were efficiently prepared using ultrasound impregnation calcination method and were employed for the treatment of cartap containing wastewater solution via mv aops the research on the mechanism showed that added h2o2 can effectively generate oh by mw irradiation in the presence of γ al2o3 then enhancing the degradation of cartap 31 what s more co2 and other active ions would react with h2o2 then produce so many oh which could break down large molecular substances into smaller ones using cod removal rate to determine the catalytic effect of each catalyst the influence of preparation factors on the catalytic performance was investigated the synthesized catalysts were characterized by xrd sem tem and xps in general considering the degradation effect and cost reduction co γ al2o3 resulted in highly efficient removal of cod the optimum experimental conditions were as follows ph 6 microwave power 300 w h2o2 dosage 0 2 ml and catalyst dosage 0 5 g to further indicate that using mv aop shows high activity we choose co γ al2o3 as example then set three control experiments one group is just use microwave technology and another group uses fenton process which contains h2o2 and co γ al2o3 the last group combined microwave technology and fenton process the removal of these three groups table s1 were 4 58 29 76 and 64 39 respectively these data indicates that mv aop has better capacity in the removal of cartap to further indicate that using mv aop shows high activity we choose co γ al2o3 as example then set three control experiments one group is just use microwave technology and another group uses fenton process which contains h2o2 and co γ al2o3 the last group combined microwave technology and fenton process the removal of these three groups table s1 were 4 58 29 76 and 64 39 respectively these data indicates that mv aop has better capacity in the removal of cartap microwave assisted application of modified γ al2o3 as a catalyst has numerous advantages such as lower consumption of oxidant wider ph range and shorter reaction time as a developing process the microwave induced co γ al2o3 catalytic oxidation process would provide a novel treatment method for the cartap bearing wastewater and would have a broad application prospect the following is the

placed evenly in the microwave digestion apparatus and high microwave power was used to carry out the digestion after the digestion is completed the solution from the digestion tank was allowed to cool and then poured into an erlenmeyer flask then indicator was added in the titration and it was titrated against standard ferrous ammonium sulfate solution the cod was calculated according to the following equation cod cr v 0 v 1 c 8 1000 v 2 where v0 and v1 are the volumes of ferrous ammonium sulfate consumed by blank water sample and wastewater sample ml respectively v2 is the volume of wastewater taken for analysis ml whereas c is the concentration of standard ferrous ammonium sulfate solution mol l 1 the digestion experiments were carried out in duplicate and average value from both the measurement was taken as the cod value 2 5 2 recovery and reuse of the catalyst in the reusability test the catalyst after the reaction was filtered thoroughly washed with deionized water and then dried at 80 c overnight to be reused under the same experimental conditions the reusability experiments were conducted for four cycles catalyst metal leaching experiment after cartap degradation we took 10 ml solutions from the reaction system and then filtered with 0 22 μm membrane then we detected the concentration of cu2 fe3 and co2 in the solutions by icp ms 3 results and discussion 3 1 factors influencing the performance of γ al2o3 supported single metal catalyst 3 1 1 concentration of active component in the catalyst fig 1 demonstrates the effect of concentration of metal ions impregnated in al2o3 on the removal of cod the trend was initial increase in the degradation rate followed by a decrease when then concentration of the metal ions was continuously increased because γ al2o3 carrier has a large specific surface area it exhibits high catalytic activity when the loading amount of active components is lower than its surface saturation value if the active load exceeds a certain amount agglomeration of the active components may take place with the carrier causing the particle size to increase and the specific surface area to decrease which affect the catalytic activity 32 fig 1 shows higher catalytic activity of co γ al2o3 compared to the other three metals and the optimum concentration for cu fe co was found to be 0 3 mol l 1 0 3 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 respectively 3 1 2 immersion time fig 2 demonstrates the effect of immersion time on the performance of catalyst from fig 2 we can find that the removal rate increased with initial increase of the immersion time but with further increase of immersion time the removal rate started decreasing slightly this may be due to the generation of ultrasonic cavitation effect in the impregnating solution in the presence of ultrasonic waves the strong shock wave results in the formation of a huge pressure on the surface and pores of the catalyst which results in the pressing of the impregnating solution into the pores of the carrier γ al2o3 in large quantities with diffusion of the active components into the pores with increasing microwave immersion time active components on the surface of γ al2o3 carrier become refined and dense and the dispersion becomes uniform this results in increasing specific surface area of the catalyst which is conducive to the adsorption activation and reaction of reactant molecules on the catalyst surface leading to improved activity of the catalyst however with continuous increase of immersion time increase of local high temperature and high pressure caused poor mechanical properties of the catalyst and a small part of pulverization leading to slight decrease in catalytic activity it was observed that co γ al2o3 shows higher removal rate compared to the others with the optimum immersion time for cu fe co being 90 min 90 min and 130 min respectively 3 1 3 calcination temperature fig 3 demonstrates the effect of calcination temperature on the performance of the catalyst the results showed that with increasing calcination temperature the cod removal rate was increased the maximum removal rate of cod for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 co γ al2o3 was observed at 400 c 500 c and 400 c respectively and then a slow fall off for all the three catalysts the potential reason being incomplete conversion of the loaded components into active components at low calcination temperature and thus they will occupy surface of the carrier leading to reduced adsorption by the carrier with increasing temperature the removal rate increases due to increase in active points but above a certain temperature the active points start to agglomerate thus reducing the specific surface area which affects the catalyst performance 3 1 4 calcination time as can be seen in fig 4 with increasing calcination time there is an increase in the removal rate followed by a decrease after certain calcination time this phenomenon is probably because too short calcination time will result in less number of active components and the carrier γ al2o3 is not closely combined leading to immature crystal growth of the catalyst if the calcination time is too long the catalyst particles will agglomerate of sinter and the particles will become longer reducing the ratio of the catalyst therefore proper calcination time is conducive to the formation of many micropores on the surface of γ al2o3 by the active components thus increasing its surface area and improving the catalytic activity it was observed from the figure that the appropriate calcination times for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 catalysts were 3 5 h 4 5 h and 4 5 h respectively 3 2 factors affecting the microwave catalytic oxidation treatment of cartap containing wastewater 3 2 1 ph ph value of the wastewater is one of the important factors of the microwave catalytic oxidation process the results are presented in fig 5 from which it can be seen that increasing ph value results in increasing removal of cod followed by a decrease when the ph was increased from 2 to 5 there was gradual increase in the cod removal rate with the removal rates of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 increasing from 45 72 and 48 75 to 55 85 and 63 69 respectively beyond ph 5 the cod removal rate began to decrease for co γ al2o3 the trend in the change of cod removal rate was similar to that of the other two but the catalytic effect was significantly better than that of the other two with wider range of ph adaptation the optimum ph of co γ al2o3 was 6 at which the removal rate could reach 69 29 when ph was lower than 4 excessive h present in the system has a sweeping effect on oh which destroys the conversion balance of metal oxides loaded on γ al2o3 thereby inhibiting the catalysis of h2o2 30 therefore the cod removal rate is low with increasing ph of the solution metal ions and h2o2 combined easily to produce a large number of oh with strong oxidizing ability which is responsible for the decomposition of macromolecular organic matter in wastewater into small molecular substances and thereby improving the effect of microwave catalytic oxidation with further increase in ph value metal ions are likely to form precipitates or complexes which hinder the combination of metal ions and h2o2 resulting in reduced decomposition of h2o2 so that the generation of oh is inhibited and the oxidation ability is reduced resulting in poor catalytic effect in conclusion the degradation process shows the optimum oxidation efficiency under acidic or neutral conditions because it may present a scavenging effect of free radicals under alkaline conditions 33 3 2 2 microwave power from fig 6 microwave power was found to have significant effect on the removal of cod with initial increase of microwave power resulting in increasing rate of removal with further increase after a certain value resulting in decreasing rate of removal for all the three catalysts cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 maximum removal rate was observed at 300 w with further increase of the microwave power the removal rate began to decrease it seemed that increasing mw power facilitates the production of oh and the removal of pollutants within certain limits 34 the potential reason is that the number of active sites on the catalyst surface increases with increasing power the number of oh generated by the action of microwaves which greatly increases the collision frequency of organic molecules in the wastewater and makes the molecular bonding more likely to break thus facilitating the degradation of organic compounds in the wastewater when microwave power continues to increase the excessive temperature may lead to partial decomposition of h2o2 into o2 and h2o which is not conducive to the generation of oh and the catalytic effect decreases 3 2 3 microwave irradiation time fig 7 shows that for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 the removal percentage of the cod was enhanced with increasing microwave irradiation time from 3 min to 10 min to increase from 48 56 54 72 and 59 12 to 66 69 72 65 and 73 65 respectively when the microwave irradiation time reached 7 8 min there was no further significant increase of the removal rate this indicates that under this condition most of the organic matter in the wastewater was degraded with no further significant change in the concentration of organic matter in the solution although further increase of the microwave irradiation time can improve the treatment effect it will lead to an increase in the energy consumption and operating costs 3 2 4 h2o2 dosage the effect of h2o2 dosage on cod removal is illustrated in fig 8 the trend observed for continuously increasing h2o2 dosage was similar to that observed for other parameters mentioned in above figures with the degradation rate increasing initially followed by a slight decrease after certain dosage the reason is that under the action of microwave catalytic conversion of h2o2 to oh takes place which promotes the degradation of organic matter but excessive dosage will produce excessive h2o2 which will capture the oh generated in the system and thereby preventing organic matter from adsorbing on the surface of catalyst this will inhibit the organic matter degradation and prevent part of oh from being effectively used at the same time it will also promote the self polymerization of the generated oh radicals to regenerate h2o2 resulting in decreased production of oh therefore the optimal h2o2 dosages for cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 were 0 20 ml 0 25 ml and 0 25 ml respectively 3 2 5 catalyst dosage fig 9 shows the effect of catalytic dosage on the removal rate of cod the figure showed that optimum dosage of co γ al2o3 and fe γ al2o3 was 0 5 g while for cu γ al2o3 it was 0 6 g the reason is that microwave radiation produces many hot spots on the uneven surface of the catalyst with increasing catalyst dosage the hot spots increase and at the same time the collision probability of h2o2 and active sites also increases thereby promoting the production of oh and consequently accelerating the reaction rate as the reaction reaches equilibrium effect of the catalyst is minimal the existence of too many active sites produces a large amount of oh within a short time and some of the oh decays or disappears before it can react with the organic matter resulting in a slight decrease of the removal efficiency 3 3 characterization and analysis 3 3 1 xrd spectra fig 10 a c depicts the xrd patterns of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 the characteristic peaks of cuo exhibited peaks at 2θ 35 543 38 708 48 716 61 335 and 66 248 the peak is narrow and the crystallinity of the catalyst surface is high but the dispersion is not uniform which makes the catalyst activity low fig 10 b shows characteristic peaks of γ al2o3 at 2θ 33 279 and 67 196 the sample showed diffraction peaks of fe2o3 at 2θ 35 684 and 53 852 indicating that the active components of the catalyst exist in the form of fe2o3 in fig 10 c there are more characteristic diffraction peaks of γ al2o3 crystals and the peaks of the active components are relatively high and low indicating that the active components are highly dispersed on the carrier 3 3 2 sem the morphology of the synthesized samples was examined from the sem micrographs with the typical sem micrographs of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 being shown in fig 11 a c the larger block or sheet structure is due to the γ al2o3 having a relatively smooth surface while the smaller particles on the surface are due to the active components of the load fig 11 a shows cuo grains have large particle size and sintering phenomenon which reduces the activity of cu γ al2o3 fig 11 b shows small particle size of the active particles which increases the specific surface area but some agglomerated particles still exist meantime the surface of the catalyst is partially indented and it was uneven distribution of the surface load and heating during the calcination process causing the collapse and thus affecting the catalytic activity fig 11 c indicates that a large number of active particles are dispersed on the surface of the co γ al2o3 and the dispersion of active components on the surface of the carrier is relatively uniform but there are also a small number of agglomerated particles 3 3 3 tem fig 12 a c shows the tem micrographs of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 respectively most of the cu γ al2o3 was found to be rod shaped which is similar to the γ al2o3 with 20 50 nm being the average length from fig 12 b fe γ al2o3 was seen to be spherical with relatively rough edges of the particles it may be due to the crystalline form of some active ingredients but the dispersion was not uniform it can be seen from fig 12 c that co γ al2o3 was in the shape of slender rod with a particle length of about 20 50 nm and the active ingredient showing high degree of dispersion on the carrier 3 3 4 xps xps analysis was carried out to gain further insights into the surface compositions of cu γ al2o3 fe γ al2o3 and co γ al2o3 the spectrum of cu 2p fig 13a was deconvoluted into three peaks these peaks of cu 2p at 933 9 ev cu 2p3 2 953 7 ev cu 2p1 2 and 943 0 ev cu 2p3 2 revealed that the main state of cu species in the catalysts was cu2 35 the spectrum of fe 2p and co 2p were just deconvoluted into one peak fig 13b revealed that fe 2p core level spectra of fe γ al2o3 deconvoluted into one characteristic peak at binding energy 710 8 ev corresponding to 2p3 2 which was attributed to fe3 chemical state 36 indicating that the iron exists in the form of fe2o3 in co 2p spectrum the observed peak of co 780 0 ev could be attributed to co 2p3 2 which indicated that the co element on the surface of co γ al2o3 was attributed to co2 chemical state 37 3 4 catalyst recovery and reuse as can be seen from fig 14 for the catalysts cu γ al2o3 and fe γ al2o3 the removal rates were 72 32 and 74 52 respectively in the first cycle after reusing it for three times the respective rate of degradation decreased to 45 69 and 50 23 the declining degradation rate may be due to the continuous dissolution and consumption of active ingredients during the recovery process the removal rate for co γ al2o3 decreased from 78 10 to 45 66 after four times of reuse with a decrease of only 32 44 it s due to the catalyst aggregate particles increased after repeated calcination so as to reduce the catalytic performance however the overall catalytic effect of co γ al2o3 was found to be higher than the others indicating that the catalyst has certain stability and reusability which can reduce the cost of wastewater treatment what s more we still focused on the catalyst metal leaching performance during our experiments then we found that cu and fe ions leaching concentration were much higher than co ion which seemed that co element could be coupled with γ al2o3 much more closely and showed good catalytic performance 4 conclusions over the years microwave assisted advanced oxidation processes have gained increasing interest in wastewater treatment and have developed rapidly to degrade pollutants as innovative treatment approaches 33 in this study γ al2o3 supported monometallic catalysts were efficiently prepared using ultrasound impregnation calcination method and were employed for the treatment of cartap containing wastewater solution via mv aops the research on the mechanism showed that added h2o2 can effectively generate oh by mw irradiation in the presence of γ al2o3 then enhancing the degradation of cartap 31 what s more co2 and other active ions would react with h2o2 then produce so many oh which could break down large molecular substances into smaller ones using cod removal rate to determine the catalytic effect of each catalyst the influence of preparation factors on the catalytic performance was investigated the synthesized catalysts were characterized by xrd sem tem and xps in general considering the degradation effect and cost reduction co γ al2o3 resulted in highly efficient removal of cod the optimum experimental conditions were as follows ph 6 microwave power 300 w h2o2 dosage 0 2 ml and catalyst dosage 0 5 g to further indicate that using mv aop shows high activity we choose co γ al2o3 as example then set three control experiments one group is just use microwave technology and another group uses fenton process which contains h2o2 and co γ al2o3 the last group combined microwave technology and fenton process the removal of these three groups table s1 were 4 58 29 76 and 64 39 respectively these data indicates that mv aop has better capacity in the removal of cartap to further indicate that using mv aop shows high activity we choose co γ al2o3 as example then set three control experiments one group is just use microwave technology and another group uses fenton process which contains h2o2 and co γ al2o3 the last group combined microwave technology and fenton process the removal of these three groups table s1 were 4 58 29 76 and 64 39 respectively these data indicates that mv aop has better capacity in the removal of cartap microwave assisted application of modified γ al2o3 as a catalyst has numerous advantages such as lower consumption of oxidant wider ph range and shorter reaction time as a developing process the microwave induced co γ al2o3 catalytic oxidation process would provide a novel treatment method for the cartap bearing wastewater and would have a broad application prospect the following is the

12616,a multi functional ma gma pvdf membrane with abundant amino groups was first prepared by grafting the intermediate with an epoxy group from glycidyl methacrylate gma into a defluorinated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and subsequently conducting an ammonifying process with melamine the highest pure water flux of the selected 0 2 ma gma pvdf was up to 562 l m2 h with a high flux recovery ratio of 97 7 indicating excellent antifouling performance cu ii concentration in the treatment volume of 47 44 l m2 met the discharge limitation of 0 5 mg l which was more than 5 3 times that of the pvdf membrane the obvious enhancement was mainly attributed to the grafted amino groups which could coordinate with cu ii with the lone pair electrons moreover inorganic salts and organic matter could improve 0 2 ma gma pvdf rejection performance in mixed systems among them nano3 could increase the effective treatment volume to 55 12 l m2 by charge shielding and compression double layer interaction owing to the unique property of amino groups the maximum removal of cu ii by citric acid was increased by 48 63 by the complexation of nh2 nh groups thus the multi functional membrane decorated with amino groups shows great potential as a promising material to efficiently remove heavy metals from complex wastewater keywords multi functional membranes amino group heavy metals inorganic salts organic acids data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction large volumes of wastewater containing heavy metals for example cu pb cr cd are extensively discharged from the manufacturing and processing industries 1 these pollutants are toxic to the aquatic ecosystem due to their nonbiodegradability and migration 2 several attempts have been made to remove heavy metals in polluted water including coagulation sedimentation adsorption and ion exchange 3 however higher strict emission limits for heavy metal pollutants have restricted application of aforementioned technologies unfortunately the complicated coexistence of organic and inorganic matter will also prevent their effective use on an industrial scale 4 membrane technology has been widely applied in the effective decontamination of wastewater due to its high rejection and adsorption abilities 5 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can remove such contaminants successfully but the high operating pressure enhances the cost drastically 6 besides conventional membrane technologies can be disturbed by coexisting inorganic salts and organic matter for concentration polarization membrane fouling charge shielding and dominant ion effects 7 8 ultrafiltration membranes are widely applied in wastewater treatment because of the advantages of being low cost and high efficient they can remove ionic contaminants by empowering them with adsorption functions hence a new generation ultrafiltration uf membrane has aroused increasing public concern more than the combined advantages of high adsorption and flux various materials functionalized with n or o containing groups have been introduced into the commercialized membrane matrix 9 10 for example zhang et al coated 3 mercaptopropionic acid on the surface of a microfilter to prepare a functional thiol based membrane which showed more than 99 9 hg removal rate within five cycles 11 li et al synthesized a novel membrane by loading zif 8 into the pores of a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane and in situ polymerizing polyacrylic acid which can effectively treat ni in electroplating wastewater with an effective treatment volume ve of 458 60 l m2 in a high salt system 12 zhang et al prepared a metal chelating membrane tap gma cn by polymerizing glycidyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile polymers and subsequently conducting amination with 2 4 6 tri aminopyrimidine 7 the ve of tap gma cn for 1 0 mm cu in electroplating wastewater cu with the initial concentration was 55 44 l m2 which can be further increased up to more than two times through bridging interaction of coexisting tartaric acid 13 consequently the groomed uf membranes can effectively remove heavy metals by chelation or electrostatic attraction additionally the coexisting organic matter can enhance the size exclusion of the complex and bridging effects of the binary components thus the successful combination of chemical modification and uf membrane polymer is a promising strategy for heavy metal removal 14 compared with conventional membranes amino decorated membranes have shown enhanced performance in heavy metal removal by environmental factors like salts and organic matter based on the salt promotion effect and complexation process 15 melamine ma containing abundant amino groups is a general modifier that has been widely used in various environmental materials 16 17 the addition of ma to the commercial membrane through grafting mixing and deposition potentially removes heavy metals consequently ma modification on the membrane is feasible in decontaminating polluted wastewater due to its outstanding thermal stability and hydraulic wear resistance pvdf an emerging water treatment material has become a promising membrane matrix for practical applications and research areas 18 compared with mixing and deposition processes grafting is of the most significant in practical application for a more stable structure 19 to improve the grafting sites the dehydrofluorination reaction can be introduced on the pvdf membrane in a low concentration of naoh solution which removes hydrogen fluoride from the polymer chain and forms carbon carbon double bonds 20 the unsaturated bond provides available sites for modification glycidyl methacrylate gma contains both a cc bond and epoxy groups which allows for bridging defluorinated pvdf and ma herein an innovative pvdf ma with functional amino groups named ma gma pvdf was synthesized rejection performance of pollutants both in the experiments of permeability and antifouling performance was evaluated by cross flow experiments the successful modification of amino groups was verified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with an attenuated total reflection atr ftir and the rejection mechanism of heavy metals was explored by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the influence of common environmental factors including ion strength and organic matter were evaluated using simulated wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals pvdf powders were provided by kynar arkema and dried at 338 k for 24 h before use gma ma polyethylene glycol peg n n dimethylformamide dmf initiator 2 2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile aibn and polymerization inhibitor 4 methoxyphenol mehq were purchased from sigma aldrich other chemical reagents involved in this article were analytically pure and provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china heavy metal stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the relevant nitrate in ultrapure water 2 2 preparation of ma gma pvdf membrane to fabricate ma gma pvdf membrane gma and ma were employed as medium linkers and amination agents respectively therefore the preparation process of ma gma pvdf membrane includes three steps defluorination of prepared pvdf the pvdf membrane was self prepared as reported in literature first 16 0 g pvdf 8 0 g peg and 76 0 g dmf were added in a three necked flask and stirred at a controlled temperature of 353 k after reaction for 24 h the mixture was settled and defoamed at room temperature for 12 h then defluorination was conducted in 1 kmno4 solution at 353 k for 8 h and a ph of 12 by koh the defluorinated membrane was denoted as pvdf f grafting gma pvdf f was added to a mixture of methyl alcohol solution with excess gma aibn and mehq grafting was maintained at 353 k for 8 h the grafted membrane was denoted as gma pvdf ammonification by ma the abovementioned membrane was then ammoniated in ma solution which was operated at 393 k for 5 h the ma gma pvdf with different ma contents was donated as x ma gma pvdf in which the x was the concentration of the ma solution in the ammonification process n2 protection was conducted in all these processes and the membrane was washed with ultrapure water and withered for the following experiments 2 3 pollutant rejection experiment the rejection performance of ma gma pvdf membrane was evaluated by effective treatment volume ve l m2 in an ultrafiltration cup yl 50 shanghai yuling china with an effective membrane diameter of 3 4 cm briefly simulated cu ii containing solution was pumped into the system the effluent was controlled by a lange pump baoding china at 17 6 l m2 h the effluent was collected every 0 5 h after passing through the membrane using an automatic collector until it breaks through cu ii was first selected as a model pollutant then potassium acid phthalate was selected as the cod standard substance the breakthrough point of cu ii was defined at 0 5 mg l based on the emissions limit of the chinese electroplating industry permeated and feed cu ii concentrations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer thermo icap 8000 usa effective treatment volume was defined to evaluate the membrane performance in as shown in supporting information the exhausted membrane was regenerated with 50 ml 0 1 mmol l hydrochloric acid after desorption with chemicals the membrane was further washed with purified water until the ph value of the effluent was 7 0 the performance of the regenerated membrane was evaluated following the above experiments 2 4 characterization the surface morphology of ma gma pvdf was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jem 2100f japan which was equipped with an attenuated total reflection attachment irprestige 21 japan surface roughness was visualized using an atomic force microscope afm dimension icon bruker in the tapping mode air the hydrophilicity of the membranes was characterized by contact angle measurements drop meter a100p xps results were obtained using a phi 5000 versa probe ulvac phi japan spectrometer using kα x ray 1468 6 ev as an energy source conducted at 15 kv and 10 ma the porosity parameters of the four membranes were further investigated by the mercury intrusion method autopore v9605 micromeritics instrument corp usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 morphology of membranes fig 1 displays typical fesem morphologies of the pvdf pvdf f gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf membranes the membrane pores were distributed uniformly on the surface of pvdf and pvdf f with no distinct differences which indicated that defluorination had no significant changes on the membrane morphology 21 furthermore the porosity of gma grafted membranes was smaller while a handful of the stacked structures were present on the membrane surface owing to the further grafting of ma more agglomerated structure and decreased porosity were exhibited which may have contributed to the elongated polymer chain and increased amination degree 22 23 additionally afm scanning of an area measuring 5 5 μm was conducted to analyze the surface roughness as shown in fig 1 and parameters are listed in table s1 supporting information with gma and ma grafting the roughness average of membranes increased the presence of gma induced a rugged surface which caused the roughness to improve to 31 9 nm the surface roughness was continuously increased to 35 9 nm for ma gma pvdf which could be induced by agglomerated polymer chains on the membrane surface 24 3 1 2 physical and chemical structures of membranes to characterize changes in the preparation process of the membranes chemical structures of gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf membranes were conducted by atr ftir comparing them with the bare pvdf the original pvdf structure was stable and it was difficult to form a stable covalent bond with a modified polymer defluorination produced unsaturated sites which provide the possibility of grafting as shown in fig 2 the characteristic peak between 970 and 990 cm 1 which belonged to the ch group in cfch generated by the dehydrofluorination of pvdf was comparable with the bare pvdf membrane then the peak disappeared after grafting ma and gma furthermore the weak peaks at 3500 and 3390 cm 1 were associated with stretching vibration of nh in amino groups while the stretching vibrations at 1333 and 1261 cm 1 could be assigned to the cn structure in the ma of gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf thus it can be proven that the content of amino groups in the modified membrane increased greatly by a nucleophilic process between ma and gma the functionalized procedure is illustrated in scheme 1 thermal stability of membranes was evaluated by the tg test as shown in fig 2 temperature at 10 weight loss was defined as the initial decomposition tid temperature which was 407 c and 387 c for pvdf and ma gma pvdf membrane respectively this indicates that the structure of the grafted pvdf was stable within 100 c even though its thermal stability was lower than the original pvdf however the tid of ma gma pvdf was higher than for pvdf membranes immobilized by sodium lauryl sulfate sds 25 char yield of pvdf at 800 c remained approximately 23 93 while for ma gma pvdf it was 21 58 therefore the weight loss could be attributed to the thermal decomposition of grafted gma and ma suggesting the structural change in the amination process 3 1 3 permeability and antifouling performance for measuring surface wettability permeability and contact angle ca of pvdf gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf with different ma modifications were evaluated as shown in fig 4 a gma pvdf showed a lower ca value than 92 3 which was recorded for pvdf membrane due to the oxygen containing functional group in the gma structure besides the ca sharply decreased to 58 2 with grafted ma content to 0 5 due to hydrophilic amino groups the pure water flux jw of pvdf and ma gma pvdf with different ma content is shown in fig 3 a where jw of pvdf was 498 l m2 h with the increased ma grafting rate jw of ma gma pvdf increasingly improved from 528 to 562 l m2 h which was higher than for pvdf additionally 0 5 ma gma pvdf possessed the highest jw corresponding to the hydrophilic amino groups which were beneficial for water transfer in the membrane pores 26 flux recovery ratio is a vital factor for assessing the antifouling performance of membranes in actual wastewater treatment the antifouling experiment is described in detail as text s1 shown in the supporting information as shown in fig 3 b it could be revealed that rt of 0 5 ma gma pvdf was much lower than that of pvdf furthermore rr accounted for the vast majority of rt demonstrating that polluted 0 5 ma gma pvdf can be recovered by physical washing these results show that ma gma pvdf has an excellent antifouling performance the enhanced pollution resistance of ma gma pvdf could be attributed to the more hydrophilic surface by grafted amino groups 17 3 2 membrane performance 3 2 1 filtration performance of ma gma pvdf to illustrate the potential application of ma gma pvdf in heavy metal decontamination plating wastewater containing cu was investigated as a typical pollutant as displayed in fig 4 and text 1 the langmuir and freundlich models were applied to evaluate the rejection properties of membranes it could be seen that the langmuir model well fitted the rejection of cu ii on the five tested membranes it was presented that the qm of tested membranes were 17 53 16 77 38 88 47 57 and 56 08 mmol m2 respectively the abundant nh2 nh promoted chemical rejection process on ma gma pvdf was comparable with that on the pvdf membrane the functional groups offered extra adsorption sites for heavy metals through chelation with lone pair electrons 27 however the linear relation between qm and ma could not be established and the qm showed an upper bound fig s1 for limited grafting sites of cc thus the qm was not going to increase with more ma therefore 0 2 ma gma pvdf would be selected for further research because of its lower cost given that 0 2 ma gma pvdf and 0 5 ma gma pvdf had a similar rejection capacity toward cu ii to confirm the practical performance of modified membranes in the dynamic rejection process long term filtration experiments of pvdf gma pvdf and 0 2 ma gma pvdf were conducted the effective treatment volumes of pvdf gma pvdf and 0 2 ma gma pvdf were 8 97 24 36 and 47 44 l m2 respectively because of more binding sites on 0 2 ma gma pvdf and the ineffective pore sieve mechanism of pvdf 0 2 ma gma pvdf had the highest effective treatment volume 13 3 2 2 effect of organic acids ca a widely coexisting organic acid that bears one oh and three cooh groups it shows a high complexation affinity to heavy metals ca was selected as a representative pollutant to elucidate the effect of organic matter coexistence on membrane rejection performance the transformation of cu species in the aqueous phase was analyzed by theoretical calculation using visual minteq ver 3 0 usa supporting information fig s2 the effective treatment volume of 70 51 l m2 could be achieved when the concentration of ca was raised to 0 4 mmol l fig 5 a however it is likely that more ca accumulated on the surface of the 0 2 ma gma pvdf with increasing ca concentration fig 6 b which may promote cu ii rejection for the bridge interaction of rejected ca additionally the cu ca complex may be rejected as a whole for hydrogen bond mechanism therefore the enhanced performance could be driven by the site bridging effect of adsorbed ca and the rejection of the cu ca complex 28 3 2 3 effect of inorganic ions it was also significant to research the effect of various salt ions on ma gma pvdf because it is commonly present in industrial wastewater the effective treatment volume of 55 12 l m2 could be achieved when the concentration of nano3 was raised to 10 mg l fig 5 c the enhanced rejection capacity under different ion strengths could be attributed to the effect of salt promotion that coexisting no3 balanced out the positive charges of adsorbed cu2 29 3 3 mechanisms of cu ii removal the pore size of 0 2 ma gma pvdf was much larger than the hydrated ionic radius of heavy metals suggesting the ineffective size sieving of the rejection process of cu ii thus the filtration performance of cu ii could be attributed to the amino groups to further verify the mechanism involved in cu ii rejection xps was conducted to research structural changes of 0 2 ma gma pvdf in the n1s core level spectrum of 0 2 ma gma pvdf the peak at 399 29 ev could be assigned to the triazine units cnc and in 399 91 ev corresponded to the neutral amino group nh2 nh respectively after rejecting cu ii a new peak appeared in the spectra of n1s in 0 2 ma gma pvdf cu which was at the binding energy of 406 86 ev the new one could correspond to the nitrogen in no3 which balanced the positive charges of the rejected cu2 30 additionally no significant shift was observed on the peak of cnc while the peak of neutral amine shifted by 0 25 ev suggesting the interaction between amino groups and pollutants 31 it is reported that n atom can donate its lone pair of electrons to construct a covalent bond with cu2 which decreases the electron cloud density and increases the binding energy 32 therefore nh2 nh played a significant function in rejecting heavy metals the adsorption energy ea among the membrane interface and cu ii was further investigated by dmol3 calculations 33 the obtained coordination configurations were presented in fig 6 the ea of two adsorption sites with cu ii were 18 58 and 28 88 ev respectively the lower ea of nh2 cu ii than pyridine cu ii indicates the stronger affinity between cu ii and amine groups which corresponded with the xps results 3 4 environmental application the generality of 0 2 ma gma pvdf was then evaluated with ni ii pb ii or cd ii metal ions as influents fig 7 a as a result 0 2 ma gma pvdf was capable of successfully rejecting common heavy metals widely existing in industrial wastewater consequently the prepared 0 2 ma gma pvdf is feasibly applicable to treat wastewater containing heavy metals in complex solutions to further evaluate the practical application of 0 2 ma gma pvdf simulated industrial water containing competing anions and organic matter was employed 34 first the penetration point of cu ii was set according to the integrated wastewater discharge limitation in china 35 when reaching the penetration point a regeneration experiment was conducted on the cu loaded membrane with 0 5 mmol l hno3 as a desorption agent after repeated cleaning with pure water the regenerated membrane could be applied in a new filtration process as shown in fig 7 b ve of 0 2 ma gma pvdf was 64 6 61 3 and 61 3 l m2 for three cycles respectively therefore 0 2 ma gma pvdf was suitable for treating cu ii from a practical environment additionally the mechanisms of cu ii rejection on 0 2 ma gma pvdf in the single and complex systems are illustrated in fig 8 the enhanced performance of organic matters could be attributed to the bridge effect of loaded organic matter 4 conclusion in summary a novel ma gma pvdf membrane functionalized with amino groups was fabricated by grafting melamine compared with commercial pvdf membrane ma gma pvdf exhibited high capacity with the highest jw of 562 l m2 h therefore 0 2 ma gma pvdf was selected for further application given its high qm of cu ii based on the chelation of nh2 nh groups it showed an effective treatment volume of 47 44 l m2 the effective treatment volume could be further promoted to 70 51 and 55 12 l m2 by ca and inorganic salts respectively these increases can be ascribed mainly to the presence of nh2 nh groups which showed bridge effect of cu ca complex and unique salt promotion effect additionally the membrane maintained an anti interference performance in efficiently rejecting cu ii in simulated wastewater therefore these findings indicate that the multi functional membrane decorated with amino groups has the potential to separate metals effectively from complex wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12616,a multi functional ma gma pvdf membrane with abundant amino groups was first prepared by grafting the intermediate with an epoxy group from glycidyl methacrylate gma into a defluorinated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and subsequently conducting an ammonifying process with melamine the highest pure water flux of the selected 0 2 ma gma pvdf was up to 562 l m2 h with a high flux recovery ratio of 97 7 indicating excellent antifouling performance cu ii concentration in the treatment volume of 47 44 l m2 met the discharge limitation of 0 5 mg l which was more than 5 3 times that of the pvdf membrane the obvious enhancement was mainly attributed to the grafted amino groups which could coordinate with cu ii with the lone pair electrons moreover inorganic salts and organic matter could improve 0 2 ma gma pvdf rejection performance in mixed systems among them nano3 could increase the effective treatment volume to 55 12 l m2 by charge shielding and compression double layer interaction owing to the unique property of amino groups the maximum removal of cu ii by citric acid was increased by 48 63 by the complexation of nh2 nh groups thus the multi functional membrane decorated with amino groups shows great potential as a promising material to efficiently remove heavy metals from complex wastewater keywords multi functional membranes amino group heavy metals inorganic salts organic acids data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction large volumes of wastewater containing heavy metals for example cu pb cr cd are extensively discharged from the manufacturing and processing industries 1 these pollutants are toxic to the aquatic ecosystem due to their nonbiodegradability and migration 2 several attempts have been made to remove heavy metals in polluted water including coagulation sedimentation adsorption and ion exchange 3 however higher strict emission limits for heavy metal pollutants have restricted application of aforementioned technologies unfortunately the complicated coexistence of organic and inorganic matter will also prevent their effective use on an industrial scale 4 membrane technology has been widely applied in the effective decontamination of wastewater due to its high rejection and adsorption abilities 5 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can remove such contaminants successfully but the high operating pressure enhances the cost drastically 6 besides conventional membrane technologies can be disturbed by coexisting inorganic salts and organic matter for concentration polarization membrane fouling charge shielding and dominant ion effects 7 8 ultrafiltration membranes are widely applied in wastewater treatment because of the advantages of being low cost and high efficient they can remove ionic contaminants by empowering them with adsorption functions hence a new generation ultrafiltration uf membrane has aroused increasing public concern more than the combined advantages of high adsorption and flux various materials functionalized with n or o containing groups have been introduced into the commercialized membrane matrix 9 10 for example zhang et al coated 3 mercaptopropionic acid on the surface of a microfilter to prepare a functional thiol based membrane which showed more than 99 9 hg removal rate within five cycles 11 li et al synthesized a novel membrane by loading zif 8 into the pores of a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane and in situ polymerizing polyacrylic acid which can effectively treat ni in electroplating wastewater with an effective treatment volume ve of 458 60 l m2 in a high salt system 12 zhang et al prepared a metal chelating membrane tap gma cn by polymerizing glycidyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile polymers and subsequently conducting amination with 2 4 6 tri aminopyrimidine 7 the ve of tap gma cn for 1 0 mm cu in electroplating wastewater cu with the initial concentration was 55 44 l m2 which can be further increased up to more than two times through bridging interaction of coexisting tartaric acid 13 consequently the groomed uf membranes can effectively remove heavy metals by chelation or electrostatic attraction additionally the coexisting organic matter can enhance the size exclusion of the complex and bridging effects of the binary components thus the successful combination of chemical modification and uf membrane polymer is a promising strategy for heavy metal removal 14 compared with conventional membranes amino decorated membranes have shown enhanced performance in heavy metal removal by environmental factors like salts and organic matter based on the salt promotion effect and complexation process 15 melamine ma containing abundant amino groups is a general modifier that has been widely used in various environmental materials 16 17 the addition of ma to the commercial membrane through grafting mixing and deposition potentially removes heavy metals consequently ma modification on the membrane is feasible in decontaminating polluted wastewater due to its outstanding thermal stability and hydraulic wear resistance pvdf an emerging water treatment material has become a promising membrane matrix for practical applications and research areas 18 compared with mixing and deposition processes grafting is of the most significant in practical application for a more stable structure 19 to improve the grafting sites the dehydrofluorination reaction can be introduced on the pvdf membrane in a low concentration of naoh solution which removes hydrogen fluoride from the polymer chain and forms carbon carbon double bonds 20 the unsaturated bond provides available sites for modification glycidyl methacrylate gma contains both a cc bond and epoxy groups which allows for bridging defluorinated pvdf and ma herein an innovative pvdf ma with functional amino groups named ma gma pvdf was synthesized rejection performance of pollutants both in the experiments of permeability and antifouling performance was evaluated by cross flow experiments the successful modification of amino groups was verified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with an attenuated total reflection atr ftir and the rejection mechanism of heavy metals was explored by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the influence of common environmental factors including ion strength and organic matter were evaluated using simulated wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals pvdf powders were provided by kynar arkema and dried at 338 k for 24 h before use gma ma polyethylene glycol peg n n dimethylformamide dmf initiator 2 2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile aibn and polymerization inhibitor 4 methoxyphenol mehq were purchased from sigma aldrich other chemical reagents involved in this article were analytically pure and provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china heavy metal stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the relevant nitrate in ultrapure water 2 2 preparation of ma gma pvdf membrane to fabricate ma gma pvdf membrane gma and ma were employed as medium linkers and amination agents respectively therefore the preparation process of ma gma pvdf membrane includes three steps defluorination of prepared pvdf the pvdf membrane was self prepared as reported in literature first 16 0 g pvdf 8 0 g peg and 76 0 g dmf were added in a three necked flask and stirred at a controlled temperature of 353 k after reaction for 24 h the mixture was settled and defoamed at room temperature for 12 h then defluorination was conducted in 1 kmno4 solution at 353 k for 8 h and a ph of 12 by koh the defluorinated membrane was denoted as pvdf f grafting gma pvdf f was added to a mixture of methyl alcohol solution with excess gma aibn and mehq grafting was maintained at 353 k for 8 h the grafted membrane was denoted as gma pvdf ammonification by ma the abovementioned membrane was then ammoniated in ma solution which was operated at 393 k for 5 h the ma gma pvdf with different ma contents was donated as x ma gma pvdf in which the x was the concentration of the ma solution in the ammonification process n2 protection was conducted in all these processes and the membrane was washed with ultrapure water and withered for the following experiments 2 3 pollutant rejection experiment the rejection performance of ma gma pvdf membrane was evaluated by effective treatment volume ve l m2 in an ultrafiltration cup yl 50 shanghai yuling china with an effective membrane diameter of 3 4 cm briefly simulated cu ii containing solution was pumped into the system the effluent was controlled by a lange pump baoding china at 17 6 l m2 h the effluent was collected every 0 5 h after passing through the membrane using an automatic collector until it breaks through cu ii was first selected as a model pollutant then potassium acid phthalate was selected as the cod standard substance the breakthrough point of cu ii was defined at 0 5 mg l based on the emissions limit of the chinese electroplating industry permeated and feed cu ii concentrations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer thermo icap 8000 usa effective treatment volume was defined to evaluate the membrane performance in as shown in supporting information the exhausted membrane was regenerated with 50 ml 0 1 mmol l hydrochloric acid after desorption with chemicals the membrane was further washed with purified water until the ph value of the effluent was 7 0 the performance of the regenerated membrane was evaluated following the above experiments 2 4 characterization the surface morphology of ma gma pvdf was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jem 2100f japan which was equipped with an attenuated total reflection attachment irprestige 21 japan surface roughness was visualized using an atomic force microscope afm dimension icon bruker in the tapping mode air the hydrophilicity of the membranes was characterized by contact angle measurements drop meter a100p xps results were obtained using a phi 5000 versa probe ulvac phi japan spectrometer using kα x ray 1468 6 ev as an energy source conducted at 15 kv and 10 ma the porosity parameters of the four membranes were further investigated by the mercury intrusion method autopore v9605 micromeritics instrument corp usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 morphology of membranes fig 1 displays typical fesem morphologies of the pvdf pvdf f gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf membranes the membrane pores were distributed uniformly on the surface of pvdf and pvdf f with no distinct differences which indicated that defluorination had no significant changes on the membrane morphology 21 furthermore the porosity of gma grafted membranes was smaller while a handful of the stacked structures were present on the membrane surface owing to the further grafting of ma more agglomerated structure and decreased porosity were exhibited which may have contributed to the elongated polymer chain and increased amination degree 22 23 additionally afm scanning of an area measuring 5 5 μm was conducted to analyze the surface roughness as shown in fig 1 and parameters are listed in table s1 supporting information with gma and ma grafting the roughness average of membranes increased the presence of gma induced a rugged surface which caused the roughness to improve to 31 9 nm the surface roughness was continuously increased to 35 9 nm for ma gma pvdf which could be induced by agglomerated polymer chains on the membrane surface 24 3 1 2 physical and chemical structures of membranes to characterize changes in the preparation process of the membranes chemical structures of gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf membranes were conducted by atr ftir comparing them with the bare pvdf the original pvdf structure was stable and it was difficult to form a stable covalent bond with a modified polymer defluorination produced unsaturated sites which provide the possibility of grafting as shown in fig 2 the characteristic peak between 970 and 990 cm 1 which belonged to the ch group in cfch generated by the dehydrofluorination of pvdf was comparable with the bare pvdf membrane then the peak disappeared after grafting ma and gma furthermore the weak peaks at 3500 and 3390 cm 1 were associated with stretching vibration of nh in amino groups while the stretching vibrations at 1333 and 1261 cm 1 could be assigned to the cn structure in the ma of gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf thus it can be proven that the content of amino groups in the modified membrane increased greatly by a nucleophilic process between ma and gma the functionalized procedure is illustrated in scheme 1 thermal stability of membranes was evaluated by the tg test as shown in fig 2 temperature at 10 weight loss was defined as the initial decomposition tid temperature which was 407 c and 387 c for pvdf and ma gma pvdf membrane respectively this indicates that the structure of the grafted pvdf was stable within 100 c even though its thermal stability was lower than the original pvdf however the tid of ma gma pvdf was higher than for pvdf membranes immobilized by sodium lauryl sulfate sds 25 char yield of pvdf at 800 c remained approximately 23 93 while for ma gma pvdf it was 21 58 therefore the weight loss could be attributed to the thermal decomposition of grafted gma and ma suggesting the structural change in the amination process 3 1 3 permeability and antifouling performance for measuring surface wettability permeability and contact angle ca of pvdf gma pvdf and ma gma pvdf with different ma modifications were evaluated as shown in fig 4 a gma pvdf showed a lower ca value than 92 3 which was recorded for pvdf membrane due to the oxygen containing functional group in the gma structure besides the ca sharply decreased to 58 2 with grafted ma content to 0 5 due to hydrophilic amino groups the pure water flux jw of pvdf and ma gma pvdf with different ma content is shown in fig 3 a where jw of pvdf was 498 l m2 h with the increased ma grafting rate jw of ma gma pvdf increasingly improved from 528 to 562 l m2 h which was higher than for pvdf additionally 0 5 ma gma pvdf possessed the highest jw corresponding to the hydrophilic amino groups which were beneficial for water transfer in the membrane pores 26 flux recovery ratio is a vital factor for assessing the antifouling performance of membranes in actual wastewater treatment the antifouling experiment is described in detail as text s1 shown in the supporting information as shown in fig 3 b it could be revealed that rt of 0 5 ma gma pvdf was much lower than that of pvdf furthermore rr accounted for the vast majority of rt demonstrating that polluted 0 5 ma gma pvdf can be recovered by physical washing these results show that ma gma pvdf has an excellent antifouling performance the enhanced pollution resistance of ma gma pvdf could be attributed to the more hydrophilic surface by grafted amino groups 17 3 2 membrane performance 3 2 1 filtration performance of ma gma pvdf to illustrate the potential application of ma gma pvdf in heavy metal decontamination plating wastewater containing cu was investigated as a typical pollutant as displayed in fig 4 and text 1 the langmuir and freundlich models were applied to evaluate the rejection properties of membranes it could be seen that the langmuir model well fitted the rejection of cu ii on the five tested membranes it was presented that the qm of tested membranes were 17 53 16 77 38 88 47 57 and 56 08 mmol m2 respectively the abundant nh2 nh promoted chemical rejection process on ma gma pvdf was comparable with that on the pvdf membrane the functional groups offered extra adsorption sites for heavy metals through chelation with lone pair electrons 27 however the linear relation between qm and ma could not be established and the qm showed an upper bound fig s1 for limited grafting sites of cc thus the qm was not going to increase with more ma therefore 0 2 ma gma pvdf would be selected for further research because of its lower cost given that 0 2 ma gma pvdf and 0 5 ma gma pvdf had a similar rejection capacity toward cu ii to confirm the practical performance of modified membranes in the dynamic rejection process long term filtration experiments of pvdf gma pvdf and 0 2 ma gma pvdf were conducted the effective treatment volumes of pvdf gma pvdf and 0 2 ma gma pvdf were 8 97 24 36 and 47 44 l m2 respectively because of more binding sites on 0 2 ma gma pvdf and the ineffective pore sieve mechanism of pvdf 0 2 ma gma pvdf had the highest effective treatment volume 13 3 2 2 effect of organic acids ca a widely coexisting organic acid that bears one oh and three cooh groups it shows a high complexation affinity to heavy metals ca was selected as a representative pollutant to elucidate the effect of organic matter coexistence on membrane rejection performance the transformation of cu species in the aqueous phase was analyzed by theoretical calculation using visual minteq ver 3 0 usa supporting information fig s2 the effective treatment volume of 70 51 l m2 could be achieved when the concentration of ca was raised to 0 4 mmol l fig 5 a however it is likely that more ca accumulated on the surface of the 0 2 ma gma pvdf with increasing ca concentration fig 6 b which may promote cu ii rejection for the bridge interaction of rejected ca additionally the cu ca complex may be rejected as a whole for hydrogen bond mechanism therefore the enhanced performance could be driven by the site bridging effect of adsorbed ca and the rejection of the cu ca complex 28 3 2 3 effect of inorganic ions it was also significant to research the effect of various salt ions on ma gma pvdf because it is commonly present in industrial wastewater the effective treatment volume of 55 12 l m2 could be achieved when the concentration of nano3 was raised to 10 mg l fig 5 c the enhanced rejection capacity under different ion strengths could be attributed to the effect of salt promotion that coexisting no3 balanced out the positive charges of adsorbed cu2 29 3 3 mechanisms of cu ii removal the pore size of 0 2 ma gma pvdf was much larger than the hydrated ionic radius of heavy metals suggesting the ineffective size sieving of the rejection process of cu ii thus the filtration performance of cu ii could be attributed to the amino groups to further verify the mechanism involved in cu ii rejection xps was conducted to research structural changes of 0 2 ma gma pvdf in the n1s core level spectrum of 0 2 ma gma pvdf the peak at 399 29 ev could be assigned to the triazine units cnc and in 399 91 ev corresponded to the neutral amino group nh2 nh respectively after rejecting cu ii a new peak appeared in the spectra of n1s in 0 2 ma gma pvdf cu which was at the binding energy of 406 86 ev the new one could correspond to the nitrogen in no3 which balanced the positive charges of the rejected cu2 30 additionally no significant shift was observed on the peak of cnc while the peak of neutral amine shifted by 0 25 ev suggesting the interaction between amino groups and pollutants 31 it is reported that n atom can donate its lone pair of electrons to construct a covalent bond with cu2 which decreases the electron cloud density and increases the binding energy 32 therefore nh2 nh played a significant function in rejecting heavy metals the adsorption energy ea among the membrane interface and cu ii was further investigated by dmol3 calculations 33 the obtained coordination configurations were presented in fig 6 the ea of two adsorption sites with cu ii were 18 58 and 28 88 ev respectively the lower ea of nh2 cu ii than pyridine cu ii indicates the stronger affinity between cu ii and amine groups which corresponded with the xps results 3 4 environmental application the generality of 0 2 ma gma pvdf was then evaluated with ni ii pb ii or cd ii metal ions as influents fig 7 a as a result 0 2 ma gma pvdf was capable of successfully rejecting common heavy metals widely existing in industrial wastewater consequently the prepared 0 2 ma gma pvdf is feasibly applicable to treat wastewater containing heavy metals in complex solutions to further evaluate the practical application of 0 2 ma gma pvdf simulated industrial water containing competing anions and organic matter was employed 34 first the penetration point of cu ii was set according to the integrated wastewater discharge limitation in china 35 when reaching the penetration point a regeneration experiment was conducted on the cu loaded membrane with 0 5 mmol l hno3 as a desorption agent after repeated cleaning with pure water the regenerated membrane could be applied in a new filtration process as shown in fig 7 b ve of 0 2 ma gma pvdf was 64 6 61 3 and 61 3 l m2 for three cycles respectively therefore 0 2 ma gma pvdf was suitable for treating cu ii from a practical environment additionally the mechanisms of cu ii rejection on 0 2 ma gma pvdf in the single and complex systems are illustrated in fig 8 the enhanced performance of organic matters could be attributed to the bridge effect of loaded organic matter 4 conclusion in summary a novel ma gma pvdf membrane functionalized with amino groups was fabricated by grafting melamine compared with commercial pvdf membrane ma gma pvdf exhibited high capacity with the highest jw of 562 l m2 h therefore 0 2 ma gma pvdf was selected for further application given its high qm of cu ii based on the chelation of nh2 nh groups it showed an effective treatment volume of 47 44 l m2 the effective treatment volume could be further promoted to 70 51 and 55 12 l m2 by ca and inorganic salts respectively these increases can be ascribed mainly to the presence of nh2 nh groups which showed bridge effect of cu ca complex and unique salt promotion effect additionally the membrane maintained an anti interference performance in efficiently rejecting cu ii in simulated wastewater therefore these findings indicate that the multi functional membrane decorated with amino groups has the potential to separate metals effectively from complex wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12617,graphene oxide go membranes were integrated with diverse nitrogen functional groups by subjecting to ammonia nh3 vapours and evaluated for resultant changes in their chemical functioning and strontium sr adsorption performance exposure to nh3 vapours amends the functional groups of go introduces amine amide ammonium functionalities and generates abundant sites prone to react with sr2 ions the extent of go restructuring and repercussions on sr adsorption behaviour were examined using different go precursors nh3 treatment methods membranes with varying go mass and other nitrogen reagents namely tri isooctyl amine pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide nitrogen group functionalization enhances the sr adsorption capacity of go membranes nearly by two times irrespective of the nh3 exposure duration and nature of precursor go membranes these nh3 subjected go membranes displayed optimum sr adsorption performance of 475 mg g reusable at least for nine filtration cycles and importantly capable of discharging 35 60 of adsorbed sr the n group supported sr separation demonstrated in the present work is an energy efficient solid state membrane based procedure which also lays a road map for development of amine amide ammonium functionalized go layers and provides flexible platform for separation of all those toxic elements displaying affinity to complex with n groups graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide strontium ammonia membrane adsorption capacity n functionalization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction extraction of long living radio nuclides from high level liquid waste hllw streams generated during reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel has been a long standing challenge removal of such hazardous radio nuclides from reprocessed solutions substantially reduces the overall radioactivity and the heat generated in repository blocks strontium 90 90sr is one among such hazardous radio nuclides having a long half life t1 2 of 28 8 years and similar binding ability to that of ca 1 accumulation of excessive concentration of sr in human body can cause diseases such as soft tissue sarcoma and leukaemia 2 on the other hand 90sr and other isotopes of sr including 89sr t1 2 50 5 days and 85sr t1 2 64 8 days are beta emitters which have been used for palliation of bone pain in arthritis prostatic cancer metabolic studies in scintigraphy and diagnosis of skeletal disease 1 3 among various organic inorganic sr extractant materials graphene oxide go has been reported as an efficient and cost effective adsorbent owing to larger surface area presence of diverse oxygen functional groups low specific mass and chemical stability 4 5 adsorption of sr on go sheets was reported to occur primarily through ion exchange 6 surface complexation 5 coordination at oxygen functional groups 7 composite coagulation 4 etc to extract the optimum potential of go as sr adsorbent material researchers have also attempted synthesis of surface modified go 8 and go composites 9 11 for separation of sr from aqueous solutions on the other hand considering the affinity of nitrogen atoms towards sr and formation of stable srn complexes incorporation of nitrogen functionalities in sr extractants has been widely investigated in recent years 12 15 in particular integration of amine nh2 10 15 and amide c o nh2 16 functional groups referred as n groups was shown to expedite the uptake of sr by formation of nsr binding states where nitrogen atoms of these functionalities provide lone pair of electrons to the unoccupied orbitals of sr2 ions 17 functionalization of go rgo sheets with n groups also increases their aqueous dispersibility 18 provide tunable electrostatic interactions 19 enhance thermal mechanical stability 20 and improve electrochemical catalytic performance 21 22 such n functionalized go nanostructures have been potentially used in water treatment heavy metal ion detection removal selective organic dye removal and antimicrobial applications 19 23 26 n groups can be incorporated in go structures through ammonia nh3 polyaniline treatment 18 22 27 grafting or compositing with chitosan 24 polyethylenimine 19 28 ethylenediamine 25 diethylenetriamine 21 polyacrylamide 16 intercalating in n based metal organic frameworks 29 photo degradation of free cyanide cn 30 etc n group functionalization of go using nh3 was primarily carried out by addition of liquid nh3 to go ethylene glycol dispersions 22 23 subjecting to nh3 gas at room temperature 18 31 and annealing of go in nh3 ambience at elevated temperatures 32 33 apart from formation of amine and or amide functionalities nh3 molecules were also reported to adsorb at defects of go get intercalated between the go layers and generate ammonium nh4 ions 34 although liquid nh3 is considered as better source for n functionalization of go as compared to the toxic hydrazine or aniline reported procedures involve complex pre treatment processes and catalysts to increase the reactivity among go functional groups and nh3 molecules 22 23 in addition factors such as lack of control over reduction of go and self aggregation of the composite sheets are known to limit the adsorption performance of obtained go nh3 composite dispersions on the other hand exposure of solid state go nanostructures to nh3 vapours rules out such complex pre treatment procedures prevents self aggregation of composites and most importantly facilitates controlled amendment of go functional groups there are very limited reports on such solvent free approach for n functionalization of go 18 and till date there is no report on development of n group integrated solid state go nanostructures for separation of the sr2 ions further most of the earlier reports on go nh3 interactions are epoxide centric where the reactivity of nh3 molecules with one or more epoxide groups in conjunction with hydroxyls defects was meticulously analyzed through theoretical calculations 35 37 it is important to revisit the interactions of nh3 molecules with ensemble of go functional groups both at individual level as well as in conjunction with others to optimize the adsorption performance of n functionalized go nanostructures which has been attempted in the present work membranes prepared using go composites both in the forms of free standing and supported ones have been widely investigated for alkali alkaline earth and heavy metal ion sieving applications and there are a few reports on selective adsorption separation of sr ions using membrane structures 28 38 40 selective sr ion adsorption has been reported to be governed by integrity and hydrophilicity of membrane structure accessibility of functional reactive sites differences in hydrated radii of ions and adsorption permeation mechanisms 13 39 40 in the case of pristine go membranes relative fractions of oxygen functional groups sp2 c domains and changes in the hydrated ionic radius of sr have been pivotal 39 41 while the nature of introduced ligands n functional sites and tunability of membrane surface structural properties were shown to be critical in development of composite membranes for sr ion separation 13 40 most of these earlier studies primarily aimed to expedite structural properties of go composite membranes to tune sr ion penetration performances and very limited attention was paid on srn functional group interactions and feasibility of using n modified go membranes for sr adsorption present study aims to functionalize go sheets with diverse nitrogen functionalities and find the optimum conditions for separation of sr from aqueous solutions using n functionalized go membranes functionalization of go sheets was carried out at room temperature using nh3 through a solvent free solid state based approach and the repercussions of n group integration on sr adsorption behaviour have been analyzed in light of morphological spectroscopic and sr adsorption results the effects of nh3 treatment procedure precursor go characteristics sr concentration and membrane properties on sr adsorption performance were comprehensively investigated and correlated with the inferences drawn from other n reagent tri isooctylamine pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide treatment studies the n functionalized go membranes displayed substantial sr separation ability and the subsequent adsorption desorption cycle studies demonstrated reusability of these membranes and significant sr recovery as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of go graphite and all the other chemicals including nano3 h2so4 kmno4 h2o2 sr no3 2 and nh3 25 used in the present work are of analytical grade go synthesis was carried out using modified hummer offeman s method 42 synthesized go solution was filtered re dispersed in ultra pure deionised water milli q 18 2 mω cm and subjected to sequential centrifugation procedures to segregate go sheets with different thickness and fractions of oxygen functional groups 41 briefly the aqueous go dispersion was centrifuged at 1000 rpm followed by 8000 rpm and 2500 rpm to separate large monolayer go sheets lgo into the supernatant sediment obtained at the end this centrifugation sequence mostly consists of thick go multilayers which are termed as tgo sheets the supernatant collected at the intermediate 8000 rpm centrifugation step facilitates to separate small go sgo sheets in terms of functionalization lgo sheets are specialized with large proportions of sp2 carbon domains and epoxides sgo sheets possess significant fractions hydroxyls and carbonyls while tgo sheets are multilayers having large fraction of carbonyls and limited epoxides the concentrations of all these aqueous go dispersions were standardized using absorbance measurements go sheets were deposited on zinc selenide substrate drop casting method for chemical composition

wavelength range of 200 500 nm zeiss make field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem 0 8 2 kv was used to record the surface morphology of go sheets deposited on hydrophilic silicon substrates fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of go and nh3 treated go sheets deposited on znse substrates were obtained using bruker vertex 70 ft ir spectrometer 4 cm 1 resolution in the wavenumber range of 4000 650 cm 1 in transmittance mode and those coated on mixed cellulose ester mce filters were recorded in attenuated total reflection atr mode in range of 4000 400 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectra

using renninshaw inviva make raman microscope equipped with a 532 nm laser as source and a ccd detector 2 3 go membrane preparation and n functionalization different volumes of aqueous lgo sgo and tgo dispersions were percolated through mixed cellulose ester mce filters merk millipore 0 45 μm porosity under vacuum for the preparation of membranes with go mass of choice these membranes were dried for 72 h before treating with nitrogen reagents for n functionalization the completely dried go membranes were subjected to nh3 tri isooctyl amine tioa pyridine and n n dimethyl acetamide dma vapours for different durations go membranes were sealed on a home designed glass flask containing fixed volumes of n reagent liquids and the produced vapours were allowed to percolate through entire membrane for uniform exposure adsorption of the n reagent weights of the n reagent subjected go membranes were correlated with their precursors after adequate drying and used for filtration of aqueous sr solutions along with go membranes 2 4 filtration of aqueous sr solutions stock solution of sr 1 0 mg ml was prepared by dissolving sr no3 2 powder in milli q water and diluted further for preparation of aqueous sr solutions of different concentration 10 75 μg ml aqueous sr solutions were percolated through different types of aforementioned go membranes under vacuum to examine their sr adsorption ability filtration experiments were carried out at constant pressure conditions using a vacuum pump of 15 l min capacity and the filtration process typically completes within first 2 min the flux of ultra pure deionised water through standard go membranes 0 1 mg go mass was observed to be 57 6 l m 2 h 1 whereas the flux values for aqueous sr solutions were found to be typically in the range of 39 4 42 6 l m 2 h 1 to verify the membrane fouling and go material loss effects go membranes were dried for 72 h after filtration and the subsequently measured weights were correlated with those of before filtration the initial sr concentrations and those of collected filtrates were analyzed using gbc avanta pal 300 model flame atomic absorption spectrometer 460 7 nm wavelength for sr the

multiple cycles for desorption studies the sr percolated membranes were immersed in milli q water and other dilute acid eluents subjected to ultra sonication for 60 min and the collected solutions were analyzed for the recovered sr 3 results and discussion 3 1 n functionalized go membranes fig 1 shows typical surface morphology of precursor lgo sheets used for preparation of go membranes and changes in their topography after transferring onto mce filter membranes the fe sem image of lgo sheets deposited on hydrophilic si substrate fig 1 a indicates that most of these sheets are morphologically flat uniformly distributed and wrinkle free monolayers having lateral dimensions in the range of 2 10 μm the insert of fig 1 a shows a photograph of membranes prepared using lgo sheets referred as lgo membranes hereafter and morphology of these membranes is shown at different scales in figs 1 b and c at the large scale fig 1 b lgo membranes display a topography typically known for mce filter membranes having rough and non uniform morphology comprising of bead like features on the other hand the high resolution fe sem image fig 1 c clearly evidences the presence of flexible and thick go layer coating on mce structure owing to the presence of multiple go layers and or their distribution over uneven mce structure the go layer coating displays largely strained morphology supplemented with wrinkle like features it may be noted that these lgo membranes were prepared using limited go mass in the range of 0 05 0 8 mg and the deposited go layers could only partially laminate the mce structure under these conditions further these lgo membranes were subjected to nh3 vapours for different durations and will be referred as lgo nh3 membranes hereafter fig 2 shows the schematics of nh3 vapour exposure to go membranes as well as aqueous sr filtration process and typical surface morphology of nh3 vapour subjected lgo membranes in comparison with their precursors fig 1 c few marginal differences including relatively smooth and wrinkle free morphological features were observed in the case of lgo nh3 membranes fig 2 c in contrast no prominent changes were seen in the surface morphology of lgo sheets deposited on si substrates even after prolonged exposure to nh3 vapours fig s1 considering the range of random variations seen at different locations of a large number of lgo and lgo nh3 membranes marginal differences observed in their morphological features may not be attributed to changes induced by nh3 vapour exposure and considered as insignificant both lgo and nh3 subjected lgo membranes prepared at different go mass conditions have been employed for filtration of aqueous sr solutions as shown in fig 2 b to evaluate the differences in their sr adsorption ability 3 2 sr adsorption ability and spectroscopic analysis changes observed in sr adsorption performance of lgo membranes after nh3 exposure and the concomitant variations in adsorption ability with increase of go mass on membrane are shown in fig 3 a the precursor lgo membranes as well as those subjected to nh3 vapours possess go mass in the range of 0 05 0 8 mg and the duration of nh3 exposure was primarily limited to 15 min from the histograms of fig 3 a it is clearly evident that nh3 exposure enhances the uptake of sr on lgo membranes significantly and in most of these cases the adsorption capacities exhibited by lgo nh3 membranes are nearly twice to those shown by their precursors these membranes displayed maximum sr adsorption capacities of 180 mg g lgo and 240 mg g lgo nh3 at limited go mass 0 05 0 1 mg conditions and their adsorption ability reduce monotonously with the raise of go mass on membrane irrespective of the nh3 exposure conditions in extension to these studies sr adsorption performances of lgo nh3 membranes 0 5 mg go obtained after different durations of nh3 exposure 15 240 min are shown in fig 3 b the precursor lgo membranes with 0 5 mg go mass displayed sr adsorption capacity of 20 mg g and again exposure to nh3 vapours clearly enhances the level of sr uptake by these membranes to 45 mg g however no substantial differences were observed in their sr adsorption performance with prolongation of nh3 exposure which is nearly similar up to first 5 45 min 45 mg g and showed only marginal improvement thereafter 45 to 55 mg g in order to understand the nature of changes induced by nh3 exposure in go ft ir spectra were recorded on precursor lgo sheets and those subjected to nh3 vapours for different durations 15 240 min the ft ir spectrum of lgo sheets fig 4 a shows various characteristic vibrational features associated with the hydroxyls adsorbed water molecules 3800 2000 cm 1 carboxylic acids 1739 cm 1 sp2 hybridised carbons 1581 cm 1 epoxides 1154 cm 1 and 867 cm 1 and ether 1025 cm 1 groups of go 43 45 upon subjecting lgo sheets to nh3 vapours for 15 min intensity of broad vibrational band in the region of 3800 2000 cm 1 enhanced significantly and two fresh shoulders are seen at 3212 cm 1 and 3060 cm 1 exposure to nh3 also eradicates the vibrational peaks associated with carboxylic acids 1739 cm 1 and epoxides 867 cm 1 introduces a new peak at 1433 cm 1 shifts the epoxide peak seen at 1154 cm 1 to 1089 cm 1 despite all these changes the vibrational peak due to sp2 hybridised carbons 1579 cm 1 remained nearly unaltered with increase of nh3 exposure duration from 15 to 240 min no further changes or substantial developments were observed in these vibrational features except marginal shifts in peak positions or nominal variations in their intensities ft ir spectra were also recorded on lgo layer coated mce membranes lgo membranes before and after subjecting to nh3 vapours to evaluate the effect of substratal mce membrane on composition of lgo coating these spectra were recorded in atr mode and the typical vibrational spectra of lgo and lgo nh3 membranes along with those of precursor mce membranes are shown in fig s2 ft ir spectrum of mce membranes fig s2 a shows sharp vibrational peaks due to co stretching 1744 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching of no2 1644 cm 1 and 1277 cm 1 co stretching 1061 cm 1 and ono2 stretching 837 cm 1 vibrations 46 coating of go layers effectively masks the vibrational features of mce membrane and the corresponding ft ir spectrum fig s2 c predominantly shows the characteristic vibrational features of go which are nearly similar to those seen for precursor lgo sheets fig 4 a subjecting lgo membranes to nh3 vapours eradicates the vibrational features associated with carboxylic acids carbonyls 1721 cm 1 and 1624 cm 1 and introduces a new intense vibrational peaks at 1584 cm 1 and 1423 cm 1 reiterating significant effects of nh3 vapour exposure on lgo sheets even in presence of mce membrane structure further substantial differences in vibrational features of nh3 subjected mce fig s2 b and lgo nh3 fig s2 d membranes evidently rules out the influence of mce membrane structure on chemical composition of lgo membranes both before and after subjecting to nh3 vapours the effect of nh3 exposure on go sheets has been further examined using xps and the obtained c 1s and n 1s core level spectra are shown fig 5 the c 1s core level spectrum of precursor lgo sheets shows a broad band with two prominent peaks at 284 6 ev and 286 8 ev whereas the spectrum of lgo nh3 sheets displays a relatively narrow band with dominant contribution from the 284 6 peak alone fig 5 a both these spectra have been deconvoluted to ascertain the changes in contributions of carbon and oxygen functional groups of go with nh3 exposure from deconvoluted c 1s spectrum of precursor lgo fig s3 a the peak at 284 6 is due to graphitic carbon sp2 c and the other higher binding energy peaks seen at 286 8 ev and 288 6 ev are attributed to co co and cooh functionalities respectively 47 in the case of lgo nh3 sample fig s3 b substantial reduction in contributions of co co 286 3 ev and cooh 288 6 ev functionalities essentially suggests significant de oxygenation and possible incorporation of nitrogen species 31 48 although the peak seen at 286 3 ev fig s3 b can be assigned to the presence of cn bond structures owing to the closer binding energy values of co co and cn bonds it is difficult to identify quantify the precise individual contributions of these functionalities on the other hand the intense and broad band observed in n 1s core level spectrum of lgo nh3 sample fig 5 b clearly evidences the incorporation of nitrogen and presence of n functionalities on go sheets the spectrum has been deconvoluted for precise identification of nitrogen bonding environment in the go carbon network which primarily shows three prominent peaks at 397 6 ev 399 6 ev and 401 5 ev fig 5 c these peaks are attributed to formation of amide co nh2 397 6 ev amine 399 7 ev and protonated quaternary nitrogen or ammonium nh4 species on nh3 subjected go as reported earlier 18 31 48 the newly generated amide amine and ammonium functional groups were observed to be typically in the ratio of 0 17 0 34 0 49 in nh3 modified go sheets further raman spectra were recorded on precursor and nh3 subjected lgo sheets to examine the effect of nitrogen incorporation and resultant changes in go carbon network fig 5 d shows the raman spectrum recorded on precursor lgo sheets which displays characteristic d 1346 cm 1 and g 1602 cm 1 bands attributed to disorder activated raman mode and first order raman scattering due to e2g vibrations respectively 49 no significant changes were observed in the peak positions of d and g bands after nh3 exposure while the corresponding integrated intensity ratio of the d to g bands id ig was found to increase from 1 40 to 1 46 increase of id ig value suggests marginal enhancement in disordered carbon content which may be attributed to incorporation nitrogen and formation of multiple nitrogen functionalities 23 3 3 nh3 go functional group interactions adsorption and reactivity of nh3 molecules on go have been extensively studied earlier through both theoretical calculations as well as experimental works 18 31 34 37 nh3 molecules were reported to physisorb at uninterrupted sp2 carbon domains pristine graphene feature and cause only minimal changes in their structural properties 35 although there are few other reports on chemisorption of nh3 at these domains formation of bonding and anti bonding orbitals and charge transfer from nh3 to graphene as well the net charge transfer among these two constituents was always reported to be close to zero 50 51 interaction among nh3 molecules and epoxides causes breaking of nh bonds in nh3 and opening of epoxide rings resulting in formation of fresh hydroxyls and amine nh2 functional groups 35 37 on the other hand hydroxyl groups of go were reported to interact with nh3 molecules via hydrogen bonding leading to development of ohn bonds 37 sequential interactions among already existing newly formed hydroxyls and amine functional groups through oohnh cause generation of h2o and nh species as well 37 on the other hand interactions among nh3 molecules and carboxylic acid groups of go generate ammonium carboxylate coo nh4 moieties and or amide co nh2 functionalities where the formation of amides was reported to be more probable under dry interaction conditions 31 52 further nh3 molecules were reported to adsorb at carbonyl groups through hydrogen bonding and form h2nho configurations 35 while interactions among adsorbed water molecules of go and nh3 molecules were shown to generate nh4 ions 34 53 in addition to all these nh3 molecules are extremely reactive at carbon defects having localised non bonding π electrons which in turn trap the nh3 molecules and cause formation of cnh2 and ch functional groups 35 54 from the ft ir spectra recorded subsequent to nh3 exposure fig 4 nominal changes in vibrational features of sp2 hybridised carbons 1579 cm 1 indicate the unaffected nature of these domains even after much possible physisorption of nh3 molecules at these sites however vibrational features around 1579 cm 1 wavenumber were also ascribed to nh in plane stretching 22 and symmetric deformation 35 vibrations of amines among other developments seen after nh3 exposure the vibrational peak introduced at 1433 cm 1 may be attributed to nh deformation vibrations of nh4 ions 35 52 as stated earlier formation of nh4 ions can occur through acid base reaction among the carboxylic acid groups and nh3 molecules or by proton transfer from adsorbed water molecules of go to nh3 34 53 although the interactions of nh3 with carboxylic acid groups 1739 cm 1 can generate both amides and carboxylates emergence of peak due to nh4 ions 1433 cm 1 and absence of vibrational features attributable to amides suggest the formation of ammonium carboxylate coo nh4 alone in the present case further the vibrational peak seen at 1089 cm 1 may be assigned to cn stretching vibrations of amines overlapping with the features due to epoxides and ethers 48 suppression of features due to epoxides 867 cm 1 and 1154 cm 1 and development of cn stretching vibrational features together suggest a sequence of nh bond dissociation epoxide ring opening reactions and consequent formation of amines this inference is supported further by emergence of a fresh vibrational peak at 3212 cm 1 which can be attributed to symmetric nh stretching vibrations of adsorbed amines 35 48 the weak shoulder seen at 3056 cm 1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of ch bonds formed following the dissociation of the nh3 molecules or nh stretching vibrations of amines adsorbed at defects edges vacancies or other dangling bonds 35 the spectroscopic analysis of nh3 subjected lgo sheets undisputedly indicate incorporation nitrogen in carbon network of go generation of multiple n functionalities and marginal increase in the disordered carbon content the dominant graphitic carbon sp2 c 284 6 ev peak in the corresponding c 1s spectrum and the unaltered sp2 c vibrational features 1579 cm 1 together suggests that these sp2 c domains are nearly unaffected by incorporation of the nitrogen species although the xps studies show significant increase in sp2 sp3 carbon ratio with the nh3 exposure fig s3 the unaltered g band peak position and marginal enhancement of id ig value fig 5 d indicate that amended sp3 hybridised carbon domains did not essentially transformed or contributed towards formation of sp2 carbons thus exposure to nh3 vapours primarily restructures sp3 hybridised carbon domains of go and amend the oxygen functional groups therein by formation of multiple n functionalities both the ft ir and xps results clearly evidence the formation of amine and ammonium functionalities in nh3 subjected lgo sheets while the deconvoluted n 1s spectrum fig 5 c suggests possible generation of amides as well however few reports on nh3 treated go at the elevated temperatures ascribed the peaks seen in binding energy range of 397 398 ev to constitution of thermally stable pyridinic n at the edges of go 33 nevertheless the relative ratio of such amide functionalities pyridinic n is considerably smaller in comparison with those of amines and ammonium functionalities formed in lgo nh3 sheets fig 5 c a schematic depicting the formation of various n functionalities on go sheet upon exposure to nh3 vapours is shown in fig 6 to provide a comprehensive picture of changes in go structure 3 4 sr adsorption at lgo and lgo nh3 membranes from all the above described sr adsorption studies fig 3 it is clearly evident that the performance of lgo nh3 membranes is significantly superior to those displayed by precursor membranes and indeed the nh3 exposure turns the lgo membranes to be more efficient in this regard the sr adsorption ability displayed by lgo membranes at limited mass conditions can be attributed to multiple factors including large surface area availability of abundant sp2 carbon domains functional groups including carboxylic acids hydroxyls epoxides and their unrestrained accessibility for adsorption of sr2 ions through cation π electron and electrostatic interactions fig 6 41 among these multiple influencing factors proportion of numerous interaction sites enhances monotonously with increase of go mass go layers on membrane whereas the effective surface area available for sr2 ion adsorption reduces substantially with enhanced packing of go layer structure although the network of nanocapillaries formed by un oxidized sp2 c domains facilitates sr ion π electron interactions accessibility of diverse oxygen functional groups residing at basal planes is largely restricted in a well interlocked lamellar structure consisting of go layers 38 precisely despite the proportional enhancement in availability of numerous adsorption sites limitations imposed by well packed lamellar structure on surface area and accessibility of interaction sites reduce the effective sr adsorption capacity with increase of go mass on membranes substantial reduction in sr adsorption capacity of thicker go membranes and the observed degradation trends corroborates well with earlier reports on go membrane supported separation of other cations 41 55 56 exposure to nh3 vapours restructures the layers of lgo membrane by amending the oxygen functional groups with amine amide and ammonium functionalities fig 4 and fig 5 without disturbing the sp2 carbon domains amine and amide functional groups are known to be better ligands for binding metal ions including sr2 ions and there are wide range of studies on development of primary secondary amines functionalities on go layers by subjecting interfacing with ammonia hydrazine aniline chitosan ethylenediamine etc 28 48 57 23 25 these amine functionalities are known to exhibit greater tendency for lone pair electron donation creation of covalent bonds with metal ions and formation of metal complexes in comparison with precursor oxygen functionalities of go 15 24 in the present case the newly integrated amine functional groups on go layers form strong bonds or complex with sr2 ions by sharing the pair of electrons on nitrogen atoms of amines which in turn are responsible for the superior adsorption of sr2 ions on nh3 modified lgo membranes there are few reports on ion exchange among ammonium ions and sr2 ions 58 59 which is much feasible in the present case and even may be one of the additional contributing factor in adsorption of sr2 ions in a nutshell along with residual oxygen functional groups amine and ammonium functionalized go layers with plentiful nitrogen atoms provide relatively more reactive sites and superior platform for sr2 ion interactions in the lgo nh3 membranes as depicted in fig 6 3 5 optimal sr adsorption and reusability in order to evaluate the optimal adsorption efficiency of lgo nh3 membranes sr removal ability of these membranes was examined at different concentrations of sr in the range of 10 75 μg ml these membranes were prepared with go mass of 0 1 mg subjected to nh3 vapours for 15 min and evaluated for their sr adsorption efficiency along with a set of precursor lgo membranes fig 7 a both the lgo and lgo nh3 membranes displayed monotonous enhancement in sr adsorption capacities with the raise of sr concentration in the range of 10 75 μg ml and again nh3 subjected membranes exhibited better sr separation ability at any of these conditions however the adsorption efficiency of lgo membranes was observed to saturate after subjecting to sr concentrations of 50 μg ml 300 mg g and above fig 7 a as stated earlier lgo membranes possess abundant sr adsorption sites in the form of carboxylic acids hydroxyls epoxides which are supplemented further by sr π electron interactions at sp2 c domains such numerous functionalities available at a lamellar structure constituted by 0 1 mg go mass appears to be sufficient enough for adsorption of sr ion concentrations in the range of 10 50 μg ml and scarce for the higher sr concentrations owing to either limited accessibility or consumption of total number of sites on the other hand amendment of existing oxygen functional groups and hence generated highly reactive amine amide and ammonium functionalities together can dispense a relatively larger number of interaction sites and provide a superior platform for sr adsorption even beyond 50 μg ml sr concentrations supporting this inference lgo nh3 membranes displayed significantly superior sr adsorption ability even at the higher sr concentrations 75 μg ml offering an optimal sr adsorption capacity of 475 mg g fig 7 a the superior adsorption ability shown by lgo nh3 membranes at different stages clearly indicates generation of additional interaction sites on go layers after nh3 exposure on the other hand the progressive adsorption behaviour displayed by the membranes evidences the availability of surplus or unoccupied active sites after subjecting to interacting with different concentrations of sr in order to verify the inference on surplus interaction sites reusability of lgo and lgo nh3 membranes was examined at multiple sr filtration cycles fig 7 b these filtration studies were carried out using lgo and lgo nh3 membranes having 0 1 mg go mass and aqueous sr solutions of 75 μg ml concentration in view of optimum sr adsorption performance fig 7 a displayed by the membranes under these conditions fig 7 b shows the sr adsorption performances exhibited by lgo and nh3 subjected lgo membranes at different filtration cycles where both the types of membranes exhibited significant sr separation ability at least up to seven different cycles beyond which substantial reduction in their performance has been observed importantly lgo nh3 membranes continued to exhibit superior sr adsorption ability throughout these cycles as compared to that of lgo ones and showed a reasonable 45 mg g 20 mg g for lgo adsorption capacity even at ninth cycle fig 7 b substantial adsorption of sr2 ions in such used membranes suggests the availability of left out interaction sites or generation of fresh active sites during the membrane drying process among which the later case may be clearly ruled out in case of reusability studies carried out on lgo nh3 membranes traces of nh3 have been observed in the sr filtrates collected after first filtration cycle whereas no such traces were seen after subsequent filtrations from fig 7 b it may be observed that the adsorption capacity of nh3 subjected lgo membranes reduces substantially after first filtration cycle and remains in similar range thereafter as stated earlier nh3 molecules are known to physisorb at uninterrupted sp2 carbon domains of go which may elute during the percolation of aqueous sr solutions despite elution of such physisorbed species the lgo nh3 membranes displayed reasonable sr adsorption ability 200 300 mg g at subsequent seven filtration cycles fig 7 b the long lasting sr adsorption performance observed for both these types of membranes reiterate the inference on availability of abundant surplus interaction sites on go membranes validate their reusability and evidence potential of such prepared membranes towards sr separation applications in order to assess the implications of other cation interference on sr adsorption process changes in the sr adsorption ability of go and nh3 subjected go membranes in presence of competing alkaline earth metal ions have been examined composite solutions having equivalent concentrations of mg sr and ba 50 μg ml each were percolated through lgo and lgo nh3 membranes having different go mass and their adsorption capacities towards individual cations were evaluated fig 7 c precursor lgo membranes 0 1 mg displayed nearly equivalent adsorption capacity in the range of 215 230 mg g towards all the three cations reiterating the inference on availability of abundant interaction sites and pronounced sorption performance altogether 670 mg g of these membranes on the other hand nh3 subjected go membranes exhibited preferential adsorption ability towards mg 275 mg g and ba 255 mg g ions in comparison with that of sr 175 mg g competitive adsorption of alkaline earth metal ions on go layers were reported to be sensitive to ionic radii cation π interactions electrostatic interactions with functional groups ease of coordination complex formations and go materials were reported to display preferential sorption towards heavier ions in particular with ba2 ions 38 60 further divalent magnesium ions were reported to exhibit strong interactions with carboxylate groups and presence of mg2 ions was shown to inhibit the uptake of sr2 ions 2 61 however with increase of go mass these lgo nh3 membranes showed considerable and relatively stable sr adsorption performance than the other two ions fig 7 c 3 6 effect of precursor functional groups as stated earlier the lgo sheets possess abundant hydroxyl carboxylic acid epoxide ether functional groups along with adsorbed water molecules most of which contribute towards the formation of amine and ammonium functionalities in order to get better insight on efficacy of these oxygen moieties in generation of fresh nitrogen functionalities and subsequent effects on sr adsorption nh3 exposure studies were carried out on different go precursors in literature various go functional group modification procedures including chemical reduction annealing ph modification and composite formation have been widely reported for selective removal of go functional groups 8 21 22 32 44 52 along with targeted functional group removal these procedures are also known to introduce secondary chemical effects such as doping structural modifications defects etc in this context go sheets having substantial differences in relative ratios for functional groups lgo sgo and tgo were chosen and segregated from same precursor go solution to avoid the possibility of unwanted secondary chemical effects in comparison with lgo the thick go tgo lateral dimensions of 2 10 μm sheets shown in fig 8 a possess very limited epoxides 1079 cm 1 large fraction of carbonyls 1624 cm 1 and are nearly free from sp2 carbon domains fig 9 a on the other hand the small go sgo lateral dimensions of 200 nm sheets shown in fig 8 b have abundant adsorbed water molecules 3600 cm 1 considerable fraction of carbonyls and again these sheets are nearly free from sp2 carbon domains fig 9 d it may be noted that epoxides are the ones primarily responsible for generation of amine groups after nh3 exposure through nh bond dissociation and epoxy ring opening reactions while presence of the carbonyls may facilitate formation of amide functionalities 35 37 as expected cn stretching vibrational features depicting the amine formation are very limited in case of nh3 exposed tgo sheets fig 9 b c while availability of carbonyls appears to facilitate the formation of amide groups 1620 cm 1 on the other hand sgo sheets formerly having large proportion of epoxides displayed strong cn related features after nh3 exposure fig 9 e f despite having limited fraction of carboxylic acids sgo sheets exhibited intense ammonium functional features 1425 cm 1 after subjecting to nh3 which indirectly suggests the role of adsorbed water molecules in generation of ammonium ions through proton transfer reactions further appearance of a peak due to in plane vibrations of sp2 carbons 1590 cm 1 in sgo sheets after longer nh3 exposure 240 min indicates significant level of reduction in sgo nh3 sheets and possible regeneration of sp2 carbon domains the sr adsorption performance of membranes prepared using tgo and sgo sheets before and after subjecting to nh3 vapours are shown in fig 10 from fig 1 a and fig 8 it may be observed that the physical dimensions of sgo and tgo sheets are substantially different from those of lgo which in turn gave rise to certain practical difficulties in preparation of membranes with uniform range of go mass in particular the lowest weight of a membrane with uniformly distributed tgo sheets has been observed to be 0 6 mg in view of these the go mass on tgo membranes was varied from practically possible lowest value of 0 6 mg to 1 4 mg whereas mass on sgo membranes was varied in the range of 0 05 0 3 mg the sr adsorption behaviour displayed by sgo membranes is nearly similar to that observed for lgo ones at different weights with maximum adsorption capacity of 350 mg g at limited go mass of 0 1 mg fig 10 b these results reiterate the inferences on substantial sr adsorption by membranes prepared at limited go mass and enhancement in extent of sr uptake with nh3 exposures further the performance of sgo membranes also corroborates well with the earlier inference on role of epoxides in enrichment of amine groups and consequent enhancement in sr adsorption ability of the go membranes on the other hand the precursor and nh3 exposed tgo membranes exhibited significantly different sr adsorption behaviour both in terms of the variation with go mass on membrane as well as extent of enhancement in sr adsorption after nh3 exposure fig 10 a these membranes showed monotonous enhancement in sr adsorption ability with the raise of go mass on membrane in contrast to those displayed by lgo sgo membranes although the adsorption capacity values displayed precursor tgo membranes are not intriguing nh3 exposure enhances their sr adsorption capacity substantially at higher go mass 1 0 1 4 mg conditions the exceptional adsorption behaviour of tgo membranes may be attributed to various factors including interactions of sr2 ions with newly formed amide groups and interlayer trapped nh3 adsorbed water molecules apart from much possible reactions of sr at ammonium and amine groups 3 7 method of nh3 exposure go sheets can be subjected to nh3 in liquid media as well as solid state film membrane forms where most of the earlier studies on nh3 adsorption nitrogen doping and amino modification of go using nh3 were carried in the liquid ambience 22 23 in the present work go sheets in the form of a supported solid state membrane are subjected to nh3 vapours for examining the changes in their characteristics as well as sr adsorption properties in addition to this method two other procedures were adopted for preparation of go nh3 membranes through a direct addition of liquid nh3 to aqueous go dispersion referred as go nh3 mix and b subjecting the aqueous go dispersion to nh3 vapours in a closed ambience under stir referred as go nh3 stir the go nh3 composite dispersions obtained from both these procedures were used for fabrication of composite membrane through vacuum filtration ft ir spectra recorded on lgo nh3 composites prepared through above said procedures are shown in fig 11 a c both these composites displayed similar vibrational features nearly comparable with those shown by lgo sheets subjected to nh3 vapours except eradication of sp2 carbon features 1580 cm 1 and emergence of new vibrational peak at 1624 cm 1 due to formation of amide functionalities fig 11 b c such similarity in vibrational features of the mix and stir composites may be expected as subjecting aqueous go dispersion to nh3 vapours in a closed ambience is a controlled approach of executing the former go nh3 mix procedure in contrast to their ft ir results the lgo nh3 membranes obtained through go nh3 mix and go nh3 stir procedures displayed substantially different sr adsorption abilities fig 11 d shows the differences in sr adsorption capacities of these membranes at different go mass conditions along with those observed for solid state lgo membrane subjected to nh3 vapours the sr adsorption performance of go nh3 mix membranes is similar to that of precursor lgo ones indicating minimal effect of liquid nh3 addition in mixture on the other hand go nh3 stir membranes exhibited significant enhancement in sr adsorption at limited go mass of 0 1 mg and these values are close to adsorption capacity displayed by the solid state lgo membrane method substantial differences in sr adsorption performance of go nh3 mix stir and solid state membrane methods suggest the need for a controlled nh3 vapour exposure for precise functionalization of go sheets and disparity in their adsorption behaviour may be explained as follows firstly interactions among go and nh3 molecules in liquid and atmospheric ambiences are very different functional groups of go directly encounter the pristine nh3 molecules in solid state membrane methods and nh3 water molecule interactions are limited to interlayers of the membrane in contrast neither of the nh3 molecules and go functional groups is in pristine form during their interactions in liquid ambience and furthermore few of these interactions may involve nh4oh instead of nh3 as well further coordination of nh3 molecules on go in liquid ambience may also induce aggregation composite sheets which in turn reduce surface area and hinder the accessibility to sr interacting functionalities all these factors including change of ambience nature of constituents and composite sheets aggregation may limit the much possible enhancement in sr adsorption by these nh3 subjected go sheets despite the formation of amine amide and ammonium functional groups 3 8 interactions with other nitrogen reagents from the earlier literature as well as the results discussed in present work nh3 molecules experience physisorption chemisorption nh bond dissociation and charge transfer during their interactions with sp2 carbon domains and diverse oxygen functional groups of go in this process various intermittent bonds including ohn oohnh h2nho conh2 coonh4 cnh2 and ch were observed to develop leading to formation of amine ammonium and amide functional groups on go sheets in order to examine the authenticity of such bond product formation and resultant impact on sr adsorption interaction mechanism of lgo sheets with three other nitrogen reagents namely tri isooctyl amine tioa pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide dma was studied in comparison with nh3 tioa is a long chain aliphatic amine pyridine is a heterocyclic nitrogen compound and dma is an amide similar to procedure described for nh3 lgo samples or membranes were subjected to these three nitrogen reagents for 15 min referred as lgo tioa lgo pyridine and lgo dma and the changes in vibrational features as well as sr adsorption performances were compared with the precursor lgo and lgo nh3 membranes fig 12 subjecting lgo sheets with tioa vapours results in eradication of features due to carboxylic acids 1732 cm 1 and marginal shift of bands associated with sp2 carbon 1574 cm 1 and epoxide 1130 cm 1 groups the vibrational peaks observed at 1574 cm 1 and 1130 cm 1 may be attributed to nh and cn stretching vibrations of amines respectively 20 21 on the other hand interaction among go and pyridine molecules enhance the broad vibrational bands at 3260 cm 1 and 1574 cm 1 shift the epoxide peak to 1098 cm 1 and generate new sharp peaks at 1486 cm 1 and 752 cm 1 the vibrational peaks seen at 1574 cm 1 1486 cm 1 and 752 cm 1 may be attributed to skeletal vibration of cc skeletal vibration of cn and ch bending vibrations of pyridine respectively while the peaks at 3260 cm 1 and 1098 cm 1 are due to nh and cn vibrations of amines 62 64 interactions among lgo and dma molecules results in enhancement of vibrational bands at 3200 cm 1 reduction of features due to carboxylic acids 1732 cm 1 and sp2 carbon 1574 cm 1 emergence of new peak at 1429 cm 1 and shift of epoxide peak to 1078 cm 1 enhancement of 3200 cm 1 nh stretch band and evolution of amide peak at 1429 cm 1 cn stretch suggests formation of amide functionalities on go sheets 30 65 the substantial changes in lgo tioa lgo pyridine and lgo dma sheets indicate the formation of amine functionalities in former two composites and amides in the later but none of these interactions appears to generate ammonium functional groups similar to their vibrational features lgo tioa lgo pyridine and lgo dma membranes also displayed different sr adsorption performances fig 12 e all these membranes were prepared at 0 3 mg go mass subjected to nitrogen reagents for 15 min and evaluated for their sr adsorption ability among all the three tioa subjected membranes exhibited significantly superior sr adsorption capacity 145 mg g which is even superior to that displayed by lgo nh3 membranes 105 mg g at this go mass conditions on the other hand the sr adsorption capacities of lgo pyridine and lgo dma membranes are seen at 95 mg g and 60 mg g tioa is an aliphatic amine which is more basic than nh3 and can rapidly polarise the oxygen functional groups of lgo and hence the superior performance formation of considerable number of amine functional groups appears to facilitate the uptake of sr2 ions on lgo tioa and lgo pyridine membranes similar to the case of lgo nh3 ones unlike the other nitrogen reagents sr adsorption performance of dma modified lgo membranes is nearly same as that of precursors despite formation of amide functional groups and no appreciable changes have been observed even after prolonged dma exposure the limited sr adsorption capacity of lgo dma may be attributed to limited interaction of lgo with dma as it is a weaker base as compared to nh3 tioa further such poor interactions of sr2 ions with amide functionalized lgo corroborates well with the limited sr adsorption ability displayed by tgo membranes 3 9 extent of sr recovery all the above described membranes including different precursor go and nh3 subjected go membranes were also examined for sr desorption characteristics after employing for filtration of aqueous sr solutions these membranes were subjected to ultra sonication for 60 min in ultrapure milli q water and the concentration of sr extracted in solution was measured stability of go membranes during the ultrasonic treatment has been verified by examining go mass and chemical composition of the aqueous sr percolated lgo membranes before and after ultrasonic treatment no significant changes were observed in go mass values on membranes indicating intactness of lgo membrane after ultrasonic treatment changes in chemical composition of these membranes after ultra sonication were analyzed by recording the corresponding ft ir spectra fig s4 a and b these spectra clearly indicate that the overall chemical composition of the membrane remain nearly same during this treatment except few changes in vibrational features associated with carboxylate 1619 cm 1 and hydroxide 1355 cm 1 complexes of sr reduction in intensities of these vibrational bands indirectly suggest desorption of sr from these interaction sites where the bonding of sr ions at the other functionalities remain nearly intact spectra recorded sr percolated lgo nh3 membranes fig s4 c and d also displayed similar changes in vibrational features after ultrasonic treatment reiterating the inferences on sr desorption sites in go membranes concentration of sr extracted from different go and go nh3 membranes was compared with the sr adsorbed during filtration for estimation of the sr recovery percentage fig 13 a significant levels of sr recovery were observed from all these types of membranes which are typically in the range from 35 to 60 while the nh3 subjected lgo membranes discharge the minimum quantities of sr 35 tgo membranes release 60 of the adsorbed sr irrespective of nh3 exposure conditions the low sr desorption from lgo lgo nh3 membranes indicates stronger binding of sr2 ions at various interaction sites as compared to sgo tgo membranes in continuation the effect of eluent media on sr2 ion recovering ability was tested by using dil hcl dil hno3 and dil h2so4 0 05 mol l 1 apart from aqueous medium these acid media have been used as typical eluents for sr recovery from various go based adsorbents 10 66 67 and their concentration was chosen in view of optimal mechanical stability of mce filters used for preparation of go membranes the lgo nh3 membranes displaying stronger binding ability towards sr2 ions and lowest sr desorption were examined for extent of sr recovery in these acid eluents interestingly all these acid media showed relatively poor sr desorption ability in the range of 8 18 in comparison with aqueous medium 35 fig 13 b the observed sr recovery percentage is very limited less than 20 in comparison with earlier reports on sr desorption from different go composites using these acidic eluents at least 90 66 67 may be ascribed to substantial differences in composition and structures of these materials the n group supported sr separation demonstrated in the present work is an effective solid state membrane based procedure where the amine amide and ammonium functional groups are introduced in go nanostructures through a simple but controlled nh3 exposure to expedite the sr removal from aqueous solutions further n functionalization of go layers in intact membrane form prevents the complex pre treatment procedures eliminates aggregation or restacking related issues and preserves the pristine internal structure of go membranes to a large extent however considerable proportions of epoxide and carbonyl groups of go appears to remain unaffected in this procedure even after 240 min of nh3 exposure fig 4 and fig 9 significant fraction of epoxides are also observed to remain unaltered even after interactions of go with tri isooctyl amine pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide reagents as well it has been reported that nh3 molecules assists in migration of epoxides to the surface to convert these functionalities into thermodynamically less stable and more reactive form which in turn facilitate the formation of amines 36 on the other hand water molecules trapped in go layers were reported to screen the accessibility of epoxide groups for reaction with nh3 and limit their interactions 34 although carbonyl groups are known to interact with nh3 through hydrogen bonding numerous carbonyl sites get regenerated during the nh bond dissociation of nh3 and epoxide ring opening reactions thus owing to inaccessibility of sites rigidity of the precursor bonds or regeneration of functionalities large proportions of these two functional groups of go remain unaffected even after prolonged nh3 exposure nevertheless along with those freshly formed n groups the residual oxygen functional groups and unaffected sp2 carbon domains facilitate the optimum uptake of sr2 ions the optimum sr adsorption performance displayed by n functionalized go membranes 475 mg g is significantly superior to those reported for other n modified go complexes using poly acrylamide acrylic acid 68 poly amidoxime 10 chitosan 57 as well as solid state go 41 and go titanosilicate composite membranes 69 the adsorption performances displayed by various n modified go complexes and go composite membranes are listed in table 1 which clearly indicates the optimum sr separation ability of n functionalized go membranes introduced in the current work the studies presented on preparation of n functionalized go membranes and optimization of their sr adsorption performance evidence and reiterate the affinity of sr2 ions at n groups and lay a road map for development of such amended membranes using simple cost effective and energy efficient approach for separation of sr2 ions from aqueous solutions 4 conclusions present work establishes nh3 vapour based n functionalization of go membranes and their efficacy in efficient separation of sr2 ions from aqueous solutions the solid state go membrane functionalization using nh3 vapours promotes unmediated interactions among pristine nh3 and go functional groups facilitates controlled amendment of go with n groups and rules out the aggregation of composite sheets n functionalization of go sheets using nh3 vapours accomplishes with first 15 min of vapour exposure and develop diverse n groups including amine amide and ammonium functionalities depending on availability and accessibility of the precursor oxygen functional groups precisely nh3 molecules are observed to physisorb at sp2 hybridised carbon domains develop ohn bonds with hydroxyls via hydrogen bonding form amines through epoxide ring opening reactions generate nh4 ions through carboxylic acid adsorbed water interactions and bring in amides through interactions with carbonyl groups the nitrogen atoms of newly formed n groups share pair of electrons form strong bonds complexes with sr2 ions which in turn facilitates superior uptake of sr on nh3 modified go membranes the extent of enhancement of sr adsorption is determined by method of nh3 treatment size and lamellar structure of go sheets relative ratios of precursor functional groups and most importantly mass of go on membranes inferences obtained from interactions of go with other nitrogen reagents and consequent repercussions on sr adsorption corroborate well with those of go nh3 and reiterate the significance of amine functionalities in enhancement of sr adsorption performance of go membranes in the present work go nh3 membranes displayed an optimum sr adsorption capacity of 475 mg g reusability up to at least nine filtration cycles and the sr recovery percentages in the range of 35 60 from these membranes the n functionalization

extraction of long living radio nuclides from high level liquid waste hllw streams generated during reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel has been a long standing challenge removal of such hazardous radio nuclides from reprocessed solutions substantially reduces the overall radioactivity and the heat generated in repository blocks strontium 90 90sr is one among such hazardous radio nuclides having a long half life t1 2 of 28 8 years and similar binding ability to that of ca 1 accumulation of excessive concentration of sr in human body can cause diseases such as soft tissue sarcoma and leukaemia 2 on the other hand 90sr and other isotopes of sr including 89sr t1 2 50 5 days and 85sr t1 2 64 8 days are beta emitters which have been used for palliation of bone pain in arthritis prostatic cancer metabolic studies in scintigraphy and diagnosis of skeletal disease 1 3 among various organic inorganic sr extractant materials graphene oxide go has been reported as an efficient and cost effective adsorbent owing to larger surface area presence of diverse oxygen functional groups low specific mass and chemical stability 4 5 adsorption of sr on go sheets was reported to occur primarily through ion exchange 6 surface complexation 5 coordination at oxygen functional groups 7 composite coagulation 4 etc to extract the optimum potential of go as sr adsorbent material researchers have also attempted synthesis of surface modified go 8 and go composites 9 11 for separation of sr from aqueous solutions on the other hand considering the affinity of nitrogen atoms towards sr and formation of stable srn complexes incorporation of nitrogen functionalities in sr extractants has been widely investigated in recent years 12 15 in particular integration of amine nh2 10 15 and amide c o nh2 16 functional groups referred as n groups was shown to expedite the uptake of sr by formation of nsr binding states where nitrogen atoms of these functionalities provide lone pair of electrons to the unoccupied orbitals of sr2 ions 17 functionalization of go rgo sheets with n groups also increases their aqueous dispersibility 18 provide tunable electrostatic interactions 19 enhance thermal mechanical stability 20 and improve electrochemical catalytic performance 21 22 such n functionalized go nanostructures have been potentially used in water treatment heavy metal ion detection removal selective organic dye removal and antimicrobial applications 19 23 26 n groups can be incorporated in go structures through ammonia nh3 polyaniline treatment 18 22 27 grafting or compositing with chitosan 24 polyethylenimine 19 28 ethylenediamine 25 diethylenetriamine 21 polyacrylamide 16 intercalating in n based metal organic frameworks 29 photo degradation of free cyanide cn 30 etc n group functionalization of go using nh3 was primarily carried out by addition of liquid nh3 to go ethylene glycol dispersions 22 23 subjecting to nh3 gas at room temperature 18 31 and annealing of go in nh3 ambience at elevated temperatures 32 33 apart from formation of amine and or amide functionalities nh3 molecules were also reported to adsorb at defects of go get intercalated between the go layers and generate ammonium nh4 ions 34 although liquid nh3 is considered as better source for n functionalization of go as compared to the toxic hydrazine or aniline reported procedures involve complex pre treatment processes and catalysts to increase the reactivity among go functional groups and nh3 molecules 22 23 in addition factors such as lack of control over reduction of go and self aggregation of the composite sheets are known to limit the adsorption performance of obtained go nh3 composite dispersions on the other hand exposure of solid state go nanostructures to nh3 vapours rules out such complex pre treatment procedures prevents self aggregation of composites and most importantly facilitates controlled amendment of go functional groups there are very limited reports on such solvent free approach for n functionalization of go 18 and till date there is no report on development of n group integrated solid state go nanostructures for separation of the sr2 ions further most of the earlier reports on go nh3 interactions are epoxide centric where the reactivity of nh3 molecules with one or more epoxide groups in conjunction with hydroxyls defects was meticulously analyzed through theoretical calculations 35 37 it is important to revisit the interactions of nh3 molecules with ensemble of go functional groups both at individual level as well as in conjunction with others to optimize the adsorption performance of n functionalized go nanostructures which has been attempted in the present work membranes prepared using go composites both in the forms of free standing and supported ones have been widely investigated for alkali alkaline earth and heavy metal ion sieving applications and there are a few reports on selective adsorption separation of sr ions using membrane structures 28 38 40 selective sr ion adsorption has been reported to be governed by integrity and hydrophilicity of membrane structure accessibility of functional reactive sites differences in hydrated radii of ions and adsorption permeation mechanisms 13 39 40 in the case of pristine go membranes relative fractions of oxygen functional groups sp2 c domains and changes in the hydrated ionic radius of sr have been pivotal 39 41 while the nature of introduced ligands n functional sites and tunability of membrane surface structural properties were shown to be critical in development of composite membranes for sr ion separation 13 40 most of these earlier studies primarily aimed to expedite structural properties of go composite membranes to tune sr ion penetration performances and very limited attention was paid on srn functional group interactions and feasibility of using n modified go membranes for sr adsorption present study aims to functionalize go sheets with diverse nitrogen functionalities and find the optimum conditions for separation of sr from aqueous solutions using n functionalized go membranes functionalization of go sheets was carried out at room temperature using nh3 through a solvent free solid state based approach and the repercussions of n group integration on sr adsorption behaviour have been analyzed in light of morphological spectroscopic and sr adsorption results the effects of nh3 treatment procedure precursor go characteristics sr concentration and membrane properties on sr adsorption performance were comprehensively investigated and correlated with the inferences drawn from other n reagent tri isooctylamine pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide treatment studies the n functionalized go membranes displayed substantial sr separation ability and the subsequent adsorption desorption cycle studies demonstrated reusability of these membranes and significant sr recovery as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of go graphite and all the other chemicals including nano3 h2so4 kmno4 h2o2 sr no3 2 and nh3 25 used in the present work are of analytical grade go synthesis was carried out using modified hummer offeman s method 42 synthesized go solution was filtered re dispersed in ultra pure deionised water milli q 18 2 mω cm and subjected to sequential centrifugation procedures to segregate go sheets with different thickness and fractions of oxygen functional groups 41 briefly the aqueous go dispersion was centrifuged at 1000 rpm followed by 8000 rpm and 2500 rpm to separate large monolayer go sheets lgo into the supernatant sediment obtained at the end this centrifugation sequence mostly consists of thick go multilayers which are termed as tgo sheets the supernatant collected at the intermediate 8000 rpm centrifugation step facilitates to separate small go sgo sheets in terms of functionalization lgo sheets are specialized with large proportions of sp2 carbon domains and epoxides sgo sheets possess significant fractions hydroxyls and carbonyls while tgo sheets are multilayers having large fraction of carbonyls and limited epoxides the concentrations of all these aqueous go dispersions were standardized using absorbance measurements go sheets were deposited on zinc selenide substrate drop casting method for chemical composition analysis hydrophilic silicon substrates dip coating method to analyze the morphology composition layer structure and mixed cellulose ester mce filters vacuum filtration for preparation of the go membranes and subsequent filtration studies 2 2 characterization of go the absorption spectra of aqueous go dispersions were recorded using avantes avaspec uv vis absorption spectrometer in the wavelength range of 200 500 nm zeiss make field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem 0 8 2 kv was used to record the surface morphology of go sheets deposited on hydrophilic silicon substrates fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of go and nh3 treated go sheets deposited on znse substrates were obtained using bruker vertex 70 ft ir spectrometer 4 cm 1 resolution in the wavenumber range of 4000 650 cm 1 in transmittance mode and those coated on mixed cellulose ester mce filters were recorded in attenuated total reflection atr mode in range of 4000 400 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectra of go and nh3 subjected go sheets were obtained using m s specs make photoelectron spectrometer equipped with al kα 1486 6 ev x ray source raman spectra of go and nh3 subjected go sheets were recorded using renninshaw inviva make raman microscope equipped with a 532 nm laser as source and a ccd detector 2 3 go membrane preparation and n functionalization different volumes of aqueous lgo sgo and tgo dispersions were percolated through mixed cellulose ester mce filters merk millipore 0 45 μm porosity under vacuum for the preparation of membranes with go mass of choice these membranes were dried for 72 h before treating with nitrogen reagents for n functionalization the completely dried go membranes were subjected to nh3 tri isooctyl amine tioa pyridine and n n dimethyl acetamide dma vapours for different durations go membranes were sealed on a home designed glass flask containing fixed volumes of n reagent liquids and the produced vapours were allowed to percolate through entire membrane for uniform exposure adsorption of the n reagent weights of the n reagent subjected go membranes were correlated with their precursors after adequate drying and used for filtration of aqueous sr solutions along with go membranes 2 4 filtration of aqueous sr solutions stock solution of sr 1 0 mg ml was prepared by dissolving sr no3 2 powder in milli q water and diluted further for preparation of aqueous sr solutions of different concentration 10 75 μg ml aqueous sr solutions were percolated through different types of aforementioned go membranes under vacuum to examine their sr adsorption ability filtration experiments were carried out at constant pressure conditions using a vacuum pump of 15 l min capacity and the filtration process typically completes within first 2 min the flux of ultra pure deionised water through standard go membranes 0 1 mg go mass was observed to be 57 6 l m 2 h 1 whereas the flux values for aqueous sr solutions were found to be typically in the range of 39 4 42 6 l m 2 h 1 to verify the membrane fouling and go material loss effects go membranes were dried for 72 h after filtration and the subsequently measured weights were correlated with those of before filtration the initial sr concentrations and those of collected filtrates were analyzed using gbc avanta pal 300 model flame atomic absorption spectrometer 460 7 nm wavelength for sr the adsorption capacity was calculated using the equation q c i c f m v where c i and c f are initial and final concentration of sr in aqueous solution in μg ml ppm m is the mass of go on membranes in mg and v is volume of aqueous sr feed solution in ml for reusability studies the aqueous sr percolated membranes were dried 72 h weighed to ensure the go mass on membrane and used for filtration of sr in multiple cycles for desorption studies the sr percolated membranes were immersed in milli q water and other dilute acid eluents subjected to ultra sonication for 60 min and the collected solutions were analyzed for the recovered sr 3 results and discussion 3 1 n functionalized go membranes fig 1 shows typical surface morphology of precursor lgo sheets used for preparation of go membranes and changes in their topography after transferring onto mce filter membranes the fe sem image of lgo sheets deposited on hydrophilic si substrate fig 1 a indicates that most of these sheets are morphologically flat uniformly distributed and wrinkle free monolayers having lateral dimensions in the range of 2 10 μm the insert of fig 1 a shows a photograph of membranes prepared using lgo sheets referred as lgo membranes hereafter and morphology of these membranes is shown at different scales in figs 1 b and c at the large scale fig 1 b lgo membranes display a topography typically known for mce filter membranes having rough and non uniform morphology comprising of bead like features on the other hand the high resolution fe sem image fig 1 c clearly evidences the presence of flexible and thick go layer coating on mce structure owing to the presence of multiple go layers and or their distribution over uneven mce structure the go layer coating displays largely strained morphology supplemented with wrinkle like features it may be noted that these lgo membranes were prepared using limited go mass in the range of 0 05 0 8 mg and the deposited go layers could only partially laminate the mce structure under these conditions further these lgo membranes were subjected to nh3 vapours for different durations and will be referred as lgo nh3 membranes hereafter fig 2 shows the schematics of nh3 vapour exposure to go membranes as well as aqueous sr filtration process and typical surface morphology of nh3 vapour subjected lgo membranes in comparison with their precursors fig 1 c few marginal differences including relatively smooth and wrinkle free morphological features were observed in the case of lgo nh3 membranes fig 2 c in contrast no prominent changes were seen in the surface morphology of lgo sheets deposited on si substrates even after prolonged exposure to nh3 vapours fig s1 considering the range of random variations seen at different locations of a large number of lgo and lgo nh3 membranes marginal differences observed in their morphological features may not be attributed to changes induced by nh3 vapour exposure and considered as insignificant both lgo and nh3 subjected lgo membranes prepared at different go mass conditions have been employed for filtration of aqueous sr solutions as shown in fig 2 b to evaluate the differences in their sr adsorption ability 3 2 sr adsorption ability and spectroscopic analysis changes observed in sr adsorption performance of lgo membranes after nh3 exposure and the concomitant variations in adsorption ability with increase of go mass on membrane are shown in fig 3 a the precursor lgo membranes as well as those subjected to nh3 vapours possess go mass in the range of 0 05 0 8 mg and the duration of nh3 exposure was primarily limited to 15 min from the histograms of fig 3 a it is clearly evident that nh3 exposure enhances the uptake of sr on lgo membranes significantly and in most of these cases the adsorption capacities exhibited by lgo nh3 membranes are nearly twice to those shown by their precursors these membranes displayed maximum sr adsorption capacities of 180 mg g lgo and 240 mg g lgo nh3 at limited go mass 0 05 0 1 mg conditions and their adsorption ability reduce monotonously with the raise of go mass on membrane irrespective of the nh3 exposure conditions in extension to these studies sr adsorption performances of lgo nh3 membranes 0 5 mg go obtained after different durations of nh3 exposure 15 240 min are shown in fig 3 b the precursor lgo membranes with 0 5 mg go mass displayed sr adsorption capacity of 20 mg g and again exposure to nh3 vapours clearly enhances the level of sr uptake by these membranes to 45 mg g however no substantial differences were observed in their sr adsorption performance with prolongation of nh3 exposure which is nearly similar up to first 5 45 min 45 mg g and showed only marginal improvement thereafter 45 to 55 mg g in order to understand the nature of changes induced by nh3 exposure in go ft ir spectra were recorded on precursor lgo sheets and those subjected to nh3 vapours for different durations 15 240 min the ft ir spectrum of lgo sheets fig 4 a shows various characteristic vibrational features associated with the hydroxyls adsorbed water molecules 3800 2000 cm 1 carboxylic acids 1739 cm 1 sp2 hybridised carbons 1581 cm 1 epoxides 1154 cm 1 and 867 cm 1 and ether 1025 cm 1 groups of go 43 45 upon subjecting lgo sheets to nh3 vapours for 15 min intensity of broad vibrational band in the region of 3800 2000 cm 1 enhanced significantly and two fresh shoulders are seen at 3212 cm 1 and 3060 cm 1 exposure to nh3 also eradicates the vibrational peaks associated with carboxylic acids 1739 cm 1 and epoxides 867 cm 1 introduces a new peak at 1433 cm 1 shifts the epoxide peak seen at 1154 cm 1 to 1089 cm 1 despite all these changes the vibrational peak due to sp2 hybridised carbons 1579 cm 1 remained nearly unaltered with increase of nh3 exposure duration from 15 to 240 min no further changes or substantial developments were observed in these vibrational features except marginal shifts in peak positions or nominal variations in their intensities ft ir spectra were also recorded on lgo layer coated mce membranes lgo membranes before and after subjecting to nh3 vapours to evaluate the effect of substratal mce membrane on composition of lgo coating these spectra were recorded in atr mode and the typical vibrational spectra of lgo and lgo nh3 membranes along with those of precursor mce membranes are shown in fig s2 ft ir spectrum of mce membranes fig s2 a shows sharp vibrational peaks due to co stretching 1744 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching of no2 1644 cm 1 and 1277 cm 1 co stretching 1061 cm 1 and ono2 stretching 837 cm 1 vibrations 46 coating of go layers effectively masks the vibrational features of mce membrane and the corresponding ft ir spectrum fig s2 c predominantly shows the characteristic vibrational features of go which are nearly similar to those seen for precursor lgo sheets fig 4 a subjecting lgo membranes to nh3 vapours eradicates the vibrational features associated with carboxylic acids carbonyls 1721 cm 1 and 1624 cm 1 and introduces a new intense vibrational peaks at 1584 cm 1 and 1423 cm 1 reiterating significant effects of nh3 vapour exposure on lgo sheets even in presence of mce membrane structure further substantial differences in vibrational features of nh3 subjected mce fig s2 b and lgo nh3 fig s2 d membranes evidently rules out the influence of mce membrane structure on chemical composition of lgo membranes both before and after subjecting to nh3 vapours the effect of nh3 exposure on go sheets has been further examined using xps and the obtained c 1s and n 1s core level spectra are shown fig 5 the c 1s core level spectrum of precursor lgo sheets shows a broad band with two prominent peaks at 284 6 ev and 286 8 ev whereas the spectrum of lgo nh3 sheets displays a relatively narrow band with dominant contribution from the 284 6 peak alone fig 5 a both these spectra have been deconvoluted to ascertain the changes in contributions of carbon and oxygen functional groups of go with nh3 exposure from deconvoluted c 1s spectrum of precursor lgo fig s3 a the peak at 284 6 is due to graphitic carbon sp2 c and the other higher binding energy peaks seen at 286 8 ev and 288 6 ev are attributed to co co and cooh functionalities respectively 47 in the case of lgo nh3 sample fig s3 b substantial reduction in contributions of co co 286 3 ev and cooh 288 6 ev functionalities essentially suggests significant de oxygenation and possible incorporation of nitrogen species 31 48 although the peak seen at 286 3 ev fig s3 b can be assigned to the presence of cn bond structures owing to the closer binding energy values of co co and cn bonds it is difficult to identify quantify the precise individual contributions of these functionalities on the other hand the intense and broad band observed in n 1s core level spectrum of lgo nh3 sample fig 5 b clearly evidences the incorporation of nitrogen and presence of n functionalities on go sheets the spectrum has been deconvoluted for precise identification of nitrogen bonding environment in the go carbon network which primarily shows three prominent peaks at 397 6 ev 399 6 ev and 401 5 ev fig 5 c these peaks are attributed to formation of amide co nh2 397 6 ev amine 399 7 ev and protonated quaternary nitrogen or ammonium nh4 species on nh3 subjected go as reported earlier 18 31 48 the newly generated amide amine and ammonium functional groups were observed to be typically in the ratio of 0 17 0 34 0 49 in nh3 modified go sheets further raman spectra were recorded on precursor and nh3 subjected lgo sheets to examine the effect of nitrogen incorporation and resultant changes in go carbon network fig 5 d shows the raman spectrum recorded on precursor lgo sheets which displays characteristic d 1346 cm 1 and g 1602 cm 1 bands attributed to disorder activated raman mode and first order raman scattering due to e2g vibrations respectively 49 no significant changes were observed in the peak positions of d and g bands after nh3 exposure while the corresponding integrated intensity ratio of the d to g bands id ig was found to increase from 1 40 to 1 46 increase of id ig value suggests marginal enhancement in disordered carbon content which may be attributed to incorporation nitrogen and formation of multiple nitrogen functionalities 23 3 3 nh3 go functional group interactions adsorption and reactivity of nh3 molecules on go have been extensively studied earlier through both theoretical calculations as well as experimental works 18 31 34 37 nh3 molecules were reported to physisorb at uninterrupted sp2 carbon domains pristine graphene feature and cause only minimal changes in their structural properties 35 although there are few other reports on chemisorption of nh3 at these domains formation of bonding and anti bonding orbitals and charge transfer from nh3 to graphene as well the net charge transfer among these two constituents was always reported to be close to zero 50 51 interaction among nh3 molecules and epoxides causes breaking of nh bonds in nh3 and opening of epoxide rings resulting in formation of fresh hydroxyls and amine nh2 functional groups 35 37 on the other hand hydroxyl groups of go were reported to interact with nh3 molecules via hydrogen bonding leading to development of ohn bonds 37 sequential interactions among already existing newly formed hydroxyls and amine functional groups through oohnh cause generation of h2o and nh species as well 37 on the other hand interactions among nh3 molecules and carboxylic acid groups of go generate ammonium carboxylate coo nh4 moieties and or amide co nh2 functionalities where the formation of amides was reported to be more probable under dry interaction conditions 31 52 further nh3 molecules were reported to adsorb at carbonyl groups through hydrogen bonding and form h2nho configurations 35 while interactions among adsorbed water molecules of go and nh3 molecules were shown to generate nh4 ions 34 53 in addition to all these nh3 molecules are extremely reactive at carbon defects having localised non bonding π electrons which in turn trap the nh3 molecules and cause formation of cnh2 and ch functional groups 35 54 from the ft ir spectra recorded subsequent to nh3 exposure fig 4 nominal changes in vibrational features of sp2 hybridised carbons 1579 cm 1 indicate the unaffected nature of these domains even after much possible physisorption of nh3 molecules at these sites however vibrational features around 1579 cm 1 wavenumber were also ascribed to nh in plane stretching 22 and symmetric deformation 35 vibrations of amines among other developments seen after nh3 exposure the vibrational peak introduced at 1433 cm 1 may be attributed to nh deformation vibrations of nh4 ions 35 52 as stated earlier formation of nh4 ions can occur through acid base reaction among the carboxylic acid groups and nh3 molecules or by proton transfer from adsorbed water molecules of go to nh3 34 53 although the interactions of nh3 with carboxylic acid groups 1739 cm 1 can generate both amides and carboxylates emergence of peak due to nh4 ions 1433 cm 1 and absence of vibrational features attributable to amides suggest the formation of ammonium carboxylate coo nh4 alone in the present case further the vibrational peak seen at 1089 cm 1 may be assigned to cn stretching vibrations of amines overlapping with the features due to epoxides and ethers 48 suppression of features due to epoxides 867 cm 1 and 1154 cm 1 and development of cn stretching vibrational features together suggest a sequence of nh bond dissociation epoxide ring opening reactions and consequent formation of amines this inference is supported further by emergence of a fresh vibrational peak at 3212 cm 1 which can be attributed to symmetric nh stretching vibrations of adsorbed amines 35 48 the weak shoulder seen at 3056 cm 1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of ch bonds formed following the dissociation of the nh3 molecules or nh stretching vibrations of amines adsorbed at defects edges vacancies or other dangling bonds 35 the spectroscopic analysis of nh3 subjected lgo sheets undisputedly indicate incorporation nitrogen in carbon network of go generation of multiple n functionalities and marginal increase in the disordered carbon content the dominant graphitic carbon sp2 c 284 6 ev peak in the corresponding c 1s spectrum and the unaltered sp2 c vibrational features 1579 cm 1 together suggests that these sp2 c domains are nearly unaffected by incorporation of the nitrogen species although the xps studies show significant increase in sp2 sp3 carbon ratio with the nh3 exposure fig s3 the unaltered g band peak position and marginal enhancement of id ig value fig 5 d indicate that amended sp3 hybridised carbon domains did not essentially transformed or contributed towards formation of sp2 carbons thus exposure to nh3 vapours primarily restructures sp3 hybridised carbon domains of go and amend the oxygen functional groups therein by formation of multiple n functionalities both the ft ir and xps results clearly evidence the formation of amine and ammonium functionalities in nh3 subjected lgo sheets while the deconvoluted n 1s spectrum fig 5 c suggests possible generation of amides as well however few reports on nh3 treated go at the elevated temperatures ascribed the peaks seen in binding energy range of 397 398 ev to constitution of thermally stable pyridinic n at the edges of go 33 nevertheless the relative ratio of such amide functionalities pyridinic n is considerably smaller in comparison with those of amines and ammonium functionalities formed in lgo nh3 sheets fig 5 c a schematic depicting the formation of various n functionalities on go sheet upon exposure to nh3 vapours is shown in fig 6 to provide a comprehensive picture of changes in go structure 3 4 sr adsorption at lgo and lgo nh3 membranes from all the above described sr adsorption studies fig 3 it is clearly evident that the performance of lgo nh3 membranes is significantly superior to those displayed by precursor membranes and indeed the nh3 exposure turns the lgo membranes to be more efficient in this regard the sr adsorption ability displayed by lgo membranes at limited mass conditions can be attributed to multiple factors including large surface area availability of abundant sp2 carbon domains functional groups including carboxylic acids hydroxyls epoxides and their unrestrained accessibility for adsorption of sr2 ions through cation π electron and electrostatic interactions fig 6 41 among these multiple influencing factors proportion of numerous interaction sites enhances monotonously with increase of go mass go layers on membrane whereas the effective surface area available for sr2 ion adsorption reduces substantially with enhanced packing of go layer structure although the network of nanocapillaries formed by un oxidized sp2 c domains facilitates sr ion π electron interactions accessibility of diverse oxygen functional groups residing at basal planes is largely restricted in a well interlocked lamellar structure consisting of go layers 38 precisely despite the proportional enhancement in availability of numerous adsorption sites limitations imposed by well packed lamellar structure on surface area and accessibility of interaction sites reduce the effective sr adsorption capacity with increase of go mass on membranes substantial reduction in sr adsorption capacity of thicker go membranes and the observed degradation trends corroborates well with earlier reports on go membrane supported separation of other cations 41 55 56 exposure to nh3 vapours restructures the layers of lgo membrane by amending the oxygen functional groups with amine amide and ammonium functionalities fig 4 and fig 5 without disturbing the sp2 carbon domains amine and amide functional groups are known to be better ligands for binding metal ions including sr2 ions and there are wide range of studies on development of primary secondary amines functionalities on go layers by subjecting interfacing with ammonia hydrazine aniline chitosan ethylenediamine etc 28 48 57 23 25 these amine functionalities are known to exhibit greater tendency for lone pair electron donation creation of covalent bonds with metal ions and formation of metal complexes in comparison with precursor oxygen functionalities of go 15 24 in the present case the newly integrated amine functional groups on go layers form strong bonds or complex with sr2 ions by sharing the pair of electrons on nitrogen atoms of amines which in turn are responsible for the superior adsorption of sr2 ions on nh3 modified lgo membranes there are few reports on ion exchange among ammonium ions and sr2 ions 58 59 which is much feasible in the present case and even may be one of the additional contributing factor in adsorption of sr2 ions in a nutshell along with residual oxygen functional groups amine and ammonium functionalized go layers with plentiful nitrogen atoms provide relatively more reactive sites and superior platform for sr2 ion interactions in the lgo nh3 membranes as depicted in fig 6 3 5 optimal sr adsorption and reusability in order to evaluate the optimal adsorption efficiency of lgo nh3 membranes sr removal ability of these membranes was examined at different concentrations of sr in the range of 10 75 μg ml these membranes were prepared with go mass of 0 1 mg subjected to nh3 vapours for 15 min and evaluated for their sr adsorption efficiency along with a set of precursor lgo membranes fig 7 a both the lgo and lgo nh3 membranes displayed monotonous enhancement in sr adsorption capacities with the raise of sr concentration in the range of 10 75 μg ml and again nh3 subjected membranes exhibited better sr separation ability at any of these conditions however the adsorption efficiency of lgo membranes was observed to saturate after subjecting to sr concentrations of 50 μg ml 300 mg g and above fig 7 a as stated earlier lgo membranes possess abundant sr adsorption sites in the form of carboxylic acids hydroxyls epoxides which are supplemented further by sr π electron interactions at sp2 c domains such numerous functionalities available at a lamellar structure constituted by 0 1 mg go mass appears to be sufficient enough for adsorption of sr ion concentrations in the range of 10 50 μg ml and scarce for the higher sr concentrations owing to either limited accessibility or consumption of total number of sites on the other hand amendment of existing oxygen functional groups and hence generated highly reactive amine amide and ammonium functionalities together can dispense a relatively larger number of interaction sites and provide a superior platform for sr adsorption even beyond 50 μg ml sr concentrations supporting this inference lgo nh3 membranes displayed significantly superior sr adsorption ability even at the higher sr concentrations 75 μg ml offering an optimal sr adsorption capacity of 475 mg g fig 7 a the superior adsorption ability shown by lgo nh3 membranes at different stages clearly indicates generation of additional interaction sites on go layers after nh3 exposure on the other hand the progressive adsorption behaviour displayed by the membranes evidences the availability of surplus or unoccupied active sites after subjecting to interacting with different concentrations of sr in order to verify the inference on surplus interaction sites reusability of lgo and lgo nh3 membranes was examined at multiple sr filtration cycles fig 7 b these filtration studies were carried out using lgo and lgo nh3 membranes having 0 1 mg go mass and aqueous sr solutions of 75 μg ml concentration in view of optimum sr adsorption performance fig 7 a displayed by the membranes under these conditions fig 7 b shows the sr adsorption performances exhibited by lgo and nh3 subjected lgo membranes at different filtration cycles where both the types of membranes exhibited significant sr separation ability at least up to seven different cycles beyond which substantial reduction in their performance has been observed importantly lgo nh3 membranes continued to exhibit superior sr adsorption ability throughout these cycles as compared to that of lgo ones and showed a reasonable 45 mg g 20 mg g for lgo adsorption capacity even at ninth cycle fig 7 b substantial adsorption of sr2 ions in such used membranes suggests the availability of left out interaction sites or generation of fresh active sites during the membrane drying process among which the later case may be clearly ruled out in case of reusability studies carried out on lgo nh3 membranes traces of nh3 have been observed in the sr filtrates collected after first filtration cycle whereas no such traces were seen after subsequent filtrations from fig 7 b it may be observed that the adsorption capacity of nh3 subjected lgo membranes reduces substantially after first filtration cycle and remains in similar range thereafter as stated earlier nh3 molecules are known to physisorb at uninterrupted sp2 carbon domains of go which may elute during the percolation of aqueous sr solutions despite elution of such physisorbed species the lgo nh3 membranes displayed reasonable sr adsorption ability 200 300 mg g at subsequent seven filtration cycles fig 7 b the long lasting sr adsorption performance observed for both these types of membranes reiterate the inference on availability of abundant surplus interaction sites on go membranes validate their reusability and evidence potential of such prepared membranes towards sr separation applications in order to assess the implications of other cation interference on sr adsorption process changes in the sr adsorption ability of go and nh3 subjected go membranes in presence of competing alkaline earth metal ions have been examined composite solutions having equivalent concentrations of mg sr and ba 50 μg ml each were percolated through lgo and lgo nh3 membranes having different go mass and their adsorption capacities towards individual cations were evaluated fig 7 c precursor lgo membranes 0 1 mg displayed nearly equivalent adsorption capacity in the range of 215 230 mg g towards all the three cations reiterating the inference on availability of abundant interaction sites and pronounced sorption performance altogether 670 mg g of these membranes on the other hand nh3 subjected go membranes exhibited preferential adsorption ability towards mg 275 mg g and ba 255 mg g ions in comparison with that of sr 175 mg g competitive adsorption of alkaline earth metal ions on go layers were reported to be sensitive to ionic radii cation π interactions electrostatic interactions with functional groups ease of coordination complex formations and go materials were reported to display preferential sorption towards heavier ions in particular with ba2 ions 38 60 further divalent magnesium ions were reported to exhibit strong interactions with carboxylate groups and presence of mg2 ions was shown to inhibit the uptake of sr2 ions 2 61 however with increase of go mass these lgo nh3 membranes showed considerable and relatively stable sr adsorption performance than the other two ions fig 7 c 3 6 effect of precursor functional groups as stated earlier the lgo sheets possess abundant hydroxyl carboxylic acid epoxide ether functional groups along with adsorbed water molecules most of which contribute towards the formation of amine and ammonium functionalities in order to get better insight on efficacy of these oxygen moieties in generation of fresh nitrogen functionalities and subsequent effects on sr adsorption nh3 exposure studies were carried out on different go precursors in literature various go functional group modification procedures including chemical reduction annealing ph modification and composite formation have been widely reported for selective removal of go functional groups 8 21 22 32 44 52 along with targeted functional group removal these procedures are also known to introduce secondary chemical effects such as doping structural modifications defects etc in this context go sheets having substantial differences in relative ratios for functional groups lgo sgo and tgo were chosen and segregated from same precursor go solution to avoid the possibility of unwanted secondary chemical effects in comparison with lgo the thick go tgo lateral dimensions of 2 10 μm sheets shown in fig 8 a possess very limited epoxides 1079 cm 1 large fraction of carbonyls 1624 cm 1 and are nearly free from sp2 carbon domains fig 9 a on the other hand the small go sgo lateral dimensions of 200 nm sheets shown in fig 8 b have abundant adsorbed water molecules 3600 cm 1 considerable fraction of carbonyls and again these sheets are nearly free from sp2 carbon domains fig 9 d it may be noted that epoxides are the ones primarily responsible for generation of amine groups after nh3 exposure through nh bond dissociation and epoxy ring opening reactions while presence of the carbonyls may facilitate formation of amide functionalities 35 37 as expected cn stretching vibrational features depicting the amine formation are very limited in case of nh3 exposed tgo sheets fig 9 b c while availability of carbonyls appears to facilitate the formation of amide groups 1620 cm 1 on the other hand sgo sheets formerly having large proportion of epoxides displayed strong cn related features after nh3 exposure fig 9 e f despite having limited fraction of carboxylic acids sgo sheets exhibited intense ammonium functional features 1425 cm 1 after subjecting to nh3 which indirectly suggests the role of adsorbed water molecules in generation of ammonium ions through proton transfer reactions further appearance of a peak due to in plane vibrations of sp2 carbons 1590 cm 1 in sgo sheets after longer nh3 exposure 240 min indicates significant level of reduction in sgo nh3 sheets and possible regeneration of sp2 carbon domains the sr adsorption performance of membranes prepared using tgo and sgo sheets before and after subjecting to nh3 vapours are shown in fig 10 from fig 1 a and fig 8 it may be observed that the physical dimensions of sgo and tgo sheets are substantially different from those of lgo which in turn gave rise to certain practical difficulties in preparation of membranes with uniform range of go mass in particular the lowest weight of a membrane with uniformly distributed tgo sheets has been observed to be 0 6 mg in view of these the go mass on tgo membranes was varied from practically possible lowest value of 0 6 mg to 1 4 mg whereas mass on sgo membranes was varied in the range of 0 05 0 3 mg the sr adsorption behaviour displayed by sgo membranes is nearly similar to that observed for lgo ones at different weights with maximum adsorption capacity of 350 mg g at limited go mass of 0 1 mg fig 10 b these results reiterate the inferences on substantial sr adsorption by membranes prepared at limited go mass and enhancement in extent of sr uptake with nh3 exposures further the performance of sgo membranes also corroborates well with the earlier inference on role of epoxides in enrichment of amine groups and consequent enhancement in sr adsorption ability of the go membranes on the other hand the precursor and nh3 exposed tgo membranes exhibited significantly different sr adsorption behaviour both in terms of the variation with go mass on membrane as well as extent of enhancement in sr adsorption after nh3 exposure fig 10 a these membranes showed monotonous enhancement in sr adsorption ability with the raise of go mass on membrane in contrast to those displayed by lgo sgo membranes although the adsorption capacity values displayed precursor tgo membranes are not intriguing nh3 exposure enhances their sr adsorption capacity substantially at higher go mass 1 0 1 4 mg conditions the exceptional adsorption behaviour of tgo membranes may be attributed to various factors including interactions of sr2 ions with newly formed amide groups and interlayer trapped nh3 adsorbed water molecules apart from much possible reactions of sr at ammonium and amine groups 3 7 method of nh3 exposure go sheets can be subjected to nh3 in liquid media as well as solid state film membrane forms where most of the earlier studies on nh3 adsorption nitrogen doping and amino modification of go using nh3 were carried in the liquid ambience 22 23 in the present work go sheets in the form of a supported solid state membrane are subjected to nh3 vapours for examining the changes in their characteristics as well as sr adsorption properties in addition to this method two other procedures were adopted for preparation of go nh3 membranes through a direct addition of liquid nh3 to aqueous go dispersion referred as go nh3 mix and b subjecting the aqueous go dispersion to nh3 vapours in a closed ambience under stir referred as go nh3 stir the go nh3 composite dispersions obtained from both these procedures were used for fabrication of composite membrane through vacuum filtration ft ir spectra recorded on lgo nh3 composites prepared through above said procedures are shown in fig 11 a c both these composites displayed similar vibrational features nearly comparable with those shown by lgo sheets subjected to nh3 vapours except eradication of sp2 carbon features 1580 cm 1 and emergence of new vibrational peak at 1624 cm 1 due to formation of amide functionalities fig 11 b c such similarity in vibrational features of the mix and stir composites may be expected as subjecting aqueous go dispersion to nh3 vapours in a closed ambience is a controlled approach of executing the former go nh3 mix procedure in contrast to their ft ir results the lgo nh3 membranes obtained through go nh3 mix and go nh3 stir procedures displayed substantially different sr adsorption abilities fig 11 d shows the differences in sr adsorption capacities of these membranes at different go mass conditions along with those observed for solid state lgo membrane subjected to nh3 vapours the sr adsorption performance of go nh3 mix membranes is similar to that of precursor lgo ones indicating minimal effect of liquid nh3 addition in mixture on the other hand go nh3 stir membranes exhibited significant enhancement in sr adsorption at limited go mass of 0 1 mg and these values are close to adsorption capacity displayed by the solid state lgo membrane method substantial differences in sr adsorption performance of go nh3 mix stir and solid state membrane methods suggest the need for a controlled nh3 vapour exposure for precise functionalization of go sheets and disparity in their adsorption behaviour may be explained as follows firstly interactions among go and nh3 molecules in liquid and atmospheric ambiences are very different functional groups of go directly encounter the pristine nh3 molecules in solid state membrane methods and nh3 water molecule interactions are limited to interlayers of the membrane in contrast neither of the nh3 molecules and go functional groups is in pristine form during their interactions in liquid ambience and furthermore few of these interactions may involve nh4oh instead of nh3 as well further coordination of nh3 molecules on go in liquid ambience may also induce aggregation composite sheets which in turn reduce surface area and hinder the accessibility to sr interacting functionalities all these factors including change of ambience nature of constituents and composite sheets aggregation may limit the much possible enhancement in sr adsorption by these nh3 subjected go sheets despite the formation of amine amide and ammonium functional groups 3 8 interactions with other nitrogen reagents from the earlier literature as well as the results discussed in present work nh3 molecules experience physisorption chemisorption nh bond dissociation and charge transfer during their interactions with sp2 carbon domains and diverse oxygen functional groups of go in this process various intermittent bonds including ohn oohnh h2nho conh2 coonh4 cnh2 and ch were observed to develop leading to formation of amine ammonium and amide functional groups on go sheets in order to examine the authenticity of such bond product formation and resultant impact on sr adsorption interaction mechanism of lgo sheets with three other nitrogen reagents namely tri isooctyl amine tioa pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide dma was studied in comparison with nh3 tioa is a long chain aliphatic amine pyridine is a heterocyclic nitrogen compound and dma is an amide similar to procedure described for nh3 lgo samples or membranes were subjected to these three nitrogen reagents for 15 min referred as lgo tioa lgo pyridine and lgo dma and the changes in vibrational features as well as sr adsorption performances were compared with the precursor lgo and lgo nh3 membranes fig 12 subjecting lgo sheets with tioa vapours results in eradication of features due to carboxylic acids 1732 cm 1 and marginal shift of bands associated with sp2 carbon 1574 cm 1 and epoxide 1130 cm 1 groups the vibrational peaks observed at 1574 cm 1 and 1130 cm 1 may be attributed to nh and cn stretching vibrations of amines respectively 20 21 on the other hand interaction among go and pyridine molecules enhance the broad vibrational bands at 3260 cm 1 and 1574 cm 1 shift the epoxide peak to 1098 cm 1 and generate new sharp peaks at 1486 cm 1 and 752 cm 1 the vibrational peaks seen at 1574 cm 1 1486 cm 1 and 752 cm 1 may be attributed to skeletal vibration of cc skeletal vibration of cn and ch bending vibrations of pyridine respectively while the peaks at 3260 cm 1 and 1098 cm 1 are due to nh and cn vibrations of amines 62 64 interactions among lgo and dma molecules results in enhancement of vibrational bands at 3200 cm 1 reduction of features due to carboxylic acids 1732 cm 1 and sp2 carbon 1574 cm 1 emergence of new peak at 1429 cm 1 and shift of epoxide peak to 1078 cm 1 enhancement of 3200 cm 1 nh stretch band and evolution of amide peak at 1429 cm 1 cn stretch suggests formation of amide functionalities on go sheets 30 65 the substantial changes in lgo tioa lgo pyridine and lgo dma sheets indicate the formation of amine functionalities in former two composites and amides in the later but none of these interactions appears to generate ammonium functional groups similar to their vibrational features lgo tioa lgo pyridine and lgo dma membranes also displayed different sr adsorption performances fig 12 e all these membranes were prepared at 0 3 mg go mass subjected to nitrogen reagents for 15 min and evaluated for their sr adsorption ability among all the three tioa subjected membranes exhibited significantly superior sr adsorption capacity 145 mg g which is even superior to that displayed by lgo nh3 membranes 105 mg g at this go mass conditions on the other hand the sr adsorption capacities of lgo pyridine and lgo dma membranes are seen at 95 mg g and 60 mg g tioa is an aliphatic amine which is more basic than nh3 and can rapidly polarise the oxygen functional groups of lgo and hence the superior performance formation of considerable number of amine functional groups appears to facilitate the uptake of sr2 ions on lgo tioa and lgo pyridine membranes similar to the case of lgo nh3 ones unlike the other nitrogen reagents sr adsorption performance of dma modified lgo membranes is nearly same as that of precursors despite formation of amide functional groups and no appreciable changes have been observed even after prolonged dma exposure the limited sr adsorption capacity of lgo dma may be attributed to limited interaction of lgo with dma as it is a weaker base as compared to nh3 tioa further such poor interactions of sr2 ions with amide functionalized lgo corroborates well with the limited sr adsorption ability displayed by tgo membranes 3 9 extent of sr recovery all the above described membranes including different precursor go and nh3 subjected go membranes were also examined for sr desorption characteristics after employing for filtration of aqueous sr solutions these membranes were subjected to ultra sonication for 60 min in ultrapure milli q water and the concentration of sr extracted in solution was measured stability of go membranes during the ultrasonic treatment has been verified by examining go mass and chemical composition of the aqueous sr percolated lgo membranes before and after ultrasonic treatment no significant changes were observed in go mass values on membranes indicating intactness of lgo membrane after ultrasonic treatment changes in chemical composition of these membranes after ultra sonication were analyzed by recording the corresponding ft ir spectra fig s4 a and b these spectra clearly indicate that the overall chemical composition of the membrane remain nearly same during this treatment except few changes in vibrational features associated with carboxylate 1619 cm 1 and hydroxide 1355 cm 1 complexes of sr reduction in intensities of these vibrational bands indirectly suggest desorption of sr from these interaction sites where the bonding of sr ions at the other functionalities remain nearly intact spectra recorded sr percolated lgo nh3 membranes fig s4 c and d also displayed similar changes in vibrational features after ultrasonic treatment reiterating the inferences on sr desorption sites in go membranes concentration of sr extracted from different go and go nh3 membranes was compared with the sr adsorbed during filtration for estimation of the sr recovery percentage fig 13 a significant levels of sr recovery were observed from all these types of membranes which are typically in the range from 35 to 60 while the nh3 subjected lgo membranes discharge the minimum quantities of sr 35 tgo membranes release 60 of the adsorbed sr irrespective of nh3 exposure conditions the low sr desorption from lgo lgo nh3 membranes indicates stronger binding of sr2 ions at various interaction sites as compared to sgo tgo membranes in continuation the effect of eluent media on sr2 ion recovering ability was tested by using dil hcl dil hno3 and dil h2so4 0 05 mol l 1 apart from aqueous medium these acid media have been used as typical eluents for sr recovery from various go based adsorbents 10 66 67 and their concentration was chosen in view of optimal mechanical stability of mce filters used for preparation of go membranes the lgo nh3 membranes displaying stronger binding ability towards sr2 ions and lowest sr desorption were examined for extent of sr recovery in these acid eluents interestingly all these acid media showed relatively poor sr desorption ability in the range of 8 18 in comparison with aqueous medium 35 fig 13 b the observed sr recovery percentage is very limited less than 20 in comparison with earlier reports on sr desorption from different go composites using these acidic eluents at least 90 66 67 may be ascribed to substantial differences in composition and structures of these materials the n group supported sr separation demonstrated in the present work is an effective solid state membrane based procedure where the amine amide and ammonium functional groups are introduced in go nanostructures through a simple but controlled nh3 exposure to expedite the sr removal from aqueous solutions further n functionalization of go layers in intact membrane form prevents the complex pre treatment procedures eliminates aggregation or restacking related issues and preserves the pristine internal structure of go membranes to a large extent however considerable proportions of epoxide and carbonyl groups of go appears to remain unaffected in this procedure even after 240 min of nh3 exposure fig 4 and fig 9 significant fraction of epoxides are also observed to remain unaltered even after interactions of go with tri isooctyl amine pyridine n n dimethyl acetamide reagents as well it has been reported that nh3 molecules assists in migration of epoxides to the surface to convert these functionalities into thermodynamically less stable and more reactive form which in turn facilitate the formation of amines 36 on the other hand water molecules trapped in go layers were reported to screen the accessibility of epoxide groups for reaction with nh3 and limit their interactions 34 although carbonyl groups are known to interact with nh3 through hydrogen bonding numerous carbonyl sites get regenerated during the nh bond dissociation of nh3 and epoxide ring opening reactions thus owing to inaccessibility of sites rigidity of the precursor bonds or regeneration of functionalities large proportions of these two functional groups of go remain unaffected even after prolonged nh3 exposure nevertheless along with those freshly formed n groups the residual oxygen functional groups and unaffected sp2 carbon domains facilitate the optimum uptake of sr2 ions the optimum sr adsorption performance displayed by n functionalized go membranes 475 mg g is significantly superior to those reported for other n modified go complexes using poly acrylamide acrylic acid 68 poly amidoxime 10 chitosan 57 as well as solid state go 41 and go titanosilicate composite membranes 69 the adsorption performances displayed by various n modified go complexes and go composite membranes are listed in table 1 which clearly indicates the optimum sr separation ability of n functionalized go membranes introduced in the current work the studies presented on preparation of n functionalized go membranes and optimization of their sr adsorption performance evidence and reiterate the affinity of sr2 ions at n groups and lay a road map for development of such amended membranes using simple cost effective and energy efficient approach for separation of sr2 ions from aqueous solutions 4 conclusions present work establishes nh3 vapour based n functionalization of go membranes and their efficacy in efficient separation of sr2 ions from aqueous solutions the solid state go membrane functionalization using nh3 vapours promotes unmediated interactions among pristine nh3 and go functional groups facilitates controlled amendment of go with n groups and rules out the aggregation of composite sheets n functionalization of go sheets using nh3 vapours accomplishes with first 15 min of vapour exposure and develop diverse n groups including amine amide and ammonium functionalities depending on availability and accessibility of the precursor oxygen functional groups precisely nh3 molecules are observed to physisorb at sp2 hybridised carbon domains develop ohn bonds with hydroxyls via hydrogen bonding form amines through epoxide ring opening reactions generate nh4 ions through carboxylic acid adsorbed water interactions and bring in amides through interactions with carbonyl groups the nitrogen atoms of newly formed n groups share pair of electrons form strong bonds complexes with sr2 ions which in turn facilitates superior uptake of sr on nh3 modified go membranes the extent of enhancement of sr adsorption is determined by method of nh3 treatment size and lamellar structure of go sheets relative ratios of precursor functional groups and most importantly mass of go on membranes inferences obtained from interactions of go with other nitrogen reagents and consequent repercussions on sr adsorption corroborate well with those of go nh3 and reiterate the significance of amine functionalities in enhancement of sr adsorption performance of go membranes in the present work go nh3 membranes displayed an optimum sr adsorption capacity of 475 mg g reusability up to at least nine filtration cycles and the sr recovery percentages in the range of 35 60 from these membranes the n functionalization method introduced in this work is an energy efficient approach for development of amine amide and ammonium functionalized go layers with plentiful nitrogen atoms which provide abundant reactive sites

12618,biochar has been widely used as an adsorbent to remove cadmium cd from polluted waters because of its high specific surface area and rich functional groups efforts have been made to modify biochar to further improve its metal adsorption capacity in this work biochars prepared using cotton straw corn straw and rice husk were first modified with ball milling and iron manganese fe mn oxides to prepare fe mn binary metal oxide ball milled biochar fe mn bmbcs compared with pristine biochars fe mn bmbcs had rough surface with deposits of fe mn oxide nanoparticles larger specific surface areas 226 50 331 50 m2 g 1 and more oxygen containing functional groups the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of cd2 on both the pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were best described by the pseudo second order model and the langmuir model respectively indicating that the adsorption of cd2 was primarily monolayer chemisorption the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were 4 8 6 1 times higher than those of pristine biochars respectively when the solution ionic strength and valence of coexisting cation increased the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs decreased because of cation competition in contrast the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs increased with the increasing solution ph value complexation with oxygen bearing functional groups ion exchange cd2 π interaction and chemical precipitation were the main mechanisms of cd2 adsorption on fe mn bmbcs therefore fe mn bmbcs prepared with different agricultural wastes have different cd2 adsorption capacities and can be

wastewater has been one of the focuses of environmental science and engineering 4 6 of the numerous technologies for cd2 removal the adsorption technology has advantages of low cost and high efficiency 7 8 many adsorbents can be derived from various agricultural and industrial wastes 9 10 therefore developing adsorbents of low cost and high adsorption capacity has currently become a research hotspot 2 11 12 biochar is a solid material obtained by thermal treatment of various biomass without oxygen or with low oxygen 13 biochars prepared from different materials have different

ball milling technology is a valid method of grinding solid materials into nano sized particles to produce nano structured materials with unique properties 22 24 in comparison with chemical impregnation ball milling technology is an efficient and environmentally friendly method for biochar modification without the addition of chemical reagents several studies have demonstrated that compared with pristine biochar ball milled biochar bmbc has higher metal adsorption capacity because of larger ssa and more functional groups 25 27 recently researchers further modify biochar with

overnight the obtained fe mn bmbcs were referred to as fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh 2 2 biochar characterization and property analysis the ash content of biochar was determined based on weight loss after a pyrolysis at 800 c biochar ph and conductivity were measured using a ph meter fe28 mettler toledo international inc usa and a conductivity meter dds 307 shanghai lei si instrument co ltd china respectively biochars were degassed for 3 h at 200 c for ssa and pore size determination using a gas sorption analyzer nova 1200e quantachrome usa based on the brunauer emmett teller bet method the micromorphology and micro composition of biochars were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds su8020 hitachi limited japan respectively biochar samples were mixed and pelleted with dehydrated kbr before being scanned between 4000 and 400 cm 1 with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa for analysis of surface functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo escalab 250 xi thermo fisher scientific usa was used to examine the surface composition and valence states of biochars with the c 1s peak at 284 8 ev serving as the internal standard calibration peak 2 3 adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate and average values of the results are presented the cd2 solution used was prepared by diluting the 1000 mg l 1 cd2 cd no3 2 4h2o stock solution with 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 i e the background electrolyte for all adsorption experiments biochar dosage was 1 0 g l 1 the initial cd2 concentration was 100 mg l 1 the solution ph was 5 the background solution was 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 and the temperature was 298 k unless otherwise stated in addition all supernatants were obtained by filtering with 0 45 μm filters and mixed with 200 μl 50 hno3 before stored for further analysis a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer pinaacle 900f perkinelmer inc usa was used for cd2 quantification for the adsorption kinetics experiment biochar was added to 100 mg l 1 cd2 solution ph 5 0 at 1 0 g l 1 while shaking on a horizontal shaker at 180 rpm and 298 k cd2 concentration in the solution was quantified after 0 3 5 10 20 40 60 90 120 150 180 240 360 480 720 and 960 min for the adsorption isotherm experiment different initial concentrations of cd2 30 50 70 100 120 150 and 180 mg l 1 were used and the equilibrium time was 12 h based on the result of the adsorption kinetics experiment the other experimental conditions were the same as those in the adsorption kinetics experiment to evaluate the stability and reusability of fe mn bmbcs an adsorption desorption experiment was carried out after cd2 adsorption the mixture was filtered and fe mn bmbcs were added into 0 1 m hcl solution for 10 h with stirring rinsed with deionized water several times and dried at 60 c before another 4 cycles of adsorption desorption both adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted under the same conditions 298 k ph 5 0 150 rpm and with the same solid liquid ratio parallel experiments were conducted to determine the experimental error the effect of solution ph on the adsorption capacity of fe mn bmbcs was investigated with initial solution ph set at 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 the effect of background ionic strength was conducted with ionic strength set at 0 001 0 005 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 mol l 1 nano3 to explore the effect of coexisting ion on cd2 removal nano3 ca no3 2 and al no3 3 0 01 mol l 1 solutions were used as electrolytes 2 4 statistical analyses the adsorption capacity calculation formula adsorption kinetics fitting models pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and intra particle diffusion model and adsorption isotherm fitting models the langmuir model and freundlich model are listed in esi 3 statistical analysis was performed using excel 2010 the origin 8 6 software was used for data analyses and figure plotting 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar characteristics 3 1 1 physicochemical properties the sbet of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh was 226 50 268 85 264 48 and 331 50 m2 g 1 respectively which was 9 16 times higher than that of the corresponding pristine biochar 4 02 19 13 28 54 and 30 35 m2 g 1 respectively fig s1 and table 1 similarly the fe mn bmbcs had larger mesopore volumes 0 33 0 32 0 33 and 0 36 cm3 g 1 than pristine biochars 0 02 0 006 0 03 and 0 03 cm3 g 1 this might be because the impurities that blocked the pores were removed and some micropores were transformed into mesopores or macropores during ball milling and modification 32 34 however the average pore sizes of pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were 6 49 7 61 nm and 4 16 5 21 nm respectively indicating that fe mn binary metal oxide particles had been loaded onto the bmbcs and taken up some of the pore space the fe mn bmbcs had a higher ash content but a lower ph than their corresponding pristine biochars table 1 which was related to the loading of fe mn oxide among the four pristine biochars dy had the highest ash content 17 67 and ph 10 73 which was likely due to the high alkali metals contents of its raw material taken from an alkaline cotton field 35 fe mn bmrh had a higher ash content 23 14 than the other three fe mn bmbcs which was attributed to its high fe mn oxide loading similar to previous studies the opposite trends of ph and ash content might be due to the accumulation of cations and carbonates on biochars 36 37 the fe on fe mn bmbcs reacted with oh to form feoh and feoh2 groups resulting in the ph decrease 38 in addition after ball milling and fe mn oxide modification the electrical conductivities of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh were significantly improved to 449 48 623 03 670 8 and 802 43 μs cm 1 respectively 3 1 2 morphological and structural features of fe mn bmbcs the morphological and structural features of pristine biochars bmbcs and fe mn bmbcs were different fig 1 the four pristine biochars showed compact biochar plates with smooth surface fig 1a1 a4 whereas the four bmbcs presented small biochar fragments with rough surface fig 1b1 b4 a previous study also found that ball milling altered particle size and surface morphology 39 with its high energy shear force and rapid extrusion 40 the smaller particle size after ball milling would be accompanied by a larger ssa which was evident in the bet results table 1 the four fe mn bmbcs showed rough surface with deposits of small fe mn oxide particles fig 1c1 c4 as proved by the eds analysis fig 1d f 3 1 3 ftir spectra of fe mn bmbcs in the ftir spectra of all pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs the two peaks near 3440 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 were due to the vibration of oh and the stretching vibration of aromatic c c c o double bonds respectively 30 41 these functional groups are active sites to bind cd2 additionally in the ftir spectra of all pristine biochars except dy the peak due to the stretching vibration of co was observed at approximately 1000 cm 1 32 42 for jx and rh the peak near 1380 cm 1 fig 2a d was attributed to the stretching vibration of carboxyl co 42 compared with pristine biochars the bands of fe mn bmbcs were stronger and broader and the c c c o band red shifted indicating that the fe mn bmbcs had more functional groups and a higher potential to adsorb cd2 the peak near 560 cm 1 in the spectra of fe mn bmbcs was attributed to the vibration of fe o mn o 30 32 indicating that the bmbcs had been successfully loaded with fe mn oxide 3 2 adsorption behavior of cd2 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics cd2 was rapidly adsorbed by both pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs in the first 20 min fig 3 then the adsorption gradually slowed down and reached an equilibrium after 4 h for pristine biochars and 3 h for fe mn bmbcs the adsorption rate changes were due to the gradual saturation of the adsorption sites on biochar surface 43 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were much higher than those of pristine biochars which was ascribed to larger ssa and more functional groups of the former 44 in addition fe mn bmrh had the highest adsorption capacity 53 92 mg g 1 among four fe mn bmbcs which was due to its larger ssa table 1 and more oxygen containing functional groups than the other three fig 2 the kinetics of cd2 adsorption on dy cb fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh was better fitted with the pseudo second order model r 2 values of 0 969 0 983 0 998 0 981 and 0 986 respectively than with the pseudo first order model r 2 values of 0 955 0 958 0 974 0 930 and 0 944 respectively table 2 this illustrated that chemisorption was responsible for cd2 adsorption by these biochars 45 47 as for jx rh and fe mn bmjx the adsorption kinetics was slightly better fitted with the pseudo first order model indicating that physisorption was mainly responsible for cd2 adsorption by these biochars 48 49 furthermore an adsorption process might be of intra particle diffusion or film diffusion or both the plot of q t versus t 0 5 showed a linear pattern of cd2 adsorption on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs which including a rapid stage a slow stage and an equilibrium stage fig 4 obviously the second step did not go through the origin indicating that surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion might both influence the cd2 adsorption rate 50 the dynamics of cd2 adsorption on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were well fitted with the intra particle diffusion model with r 2 0 90 in the second adsorption stage the cd2 diffusion rates for fe mn bmbcs k id2 0 640 1 30 mg g min0 5 1 were faster than those for pristine biochars k id2 0 214 0 622 mg g min0 5 1 indicating that cd2 was more rapidly adsorbed by the former in summary cd2 adsorption on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs began with rapid adsorption on the surface boundary layer followed by intra particle diffusion 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption amount of cd2 on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs increased with the increasing initial cd2 concentration figs 5 s2 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were significantly higher than those of pristine biochars fig 5 for example when the equilibrium concentration of cd2 was 100 mg l 1 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh were 44 75 34 65 32 54 and 55 76 mg g 1 respectively while those of jx dy cb and rh were 9 57 12 3 15 61 and 12 15 mg g 1 respectively obviously pristine biochars prepared with different raw materials had different adsorption capacities and fe mn bmbcs had higher adsorption capacities than pristine biochars the previous studies table s1 also showed that the biochar prepared with different biomass had different adsorption capacity and the modified biochar had better adsorption capacity which was similar to this work compared with conventional biochar and fe mn oxide for cd2 removal fe mn bmbcs had higher adsorption capacities therefore fe mn bmbc could be regarded as a noteworthy and potential adsorbent for the cd2 removal the higher adsorption capacities and removal efficiencies figs 5 s3 of fe mn bmbcs compared with pristine biochars were attributed to the increases in ssa and functional groups after ball milling and fe mn oxide modification combined with the previous analysis of characterization results the high ash contents of the fe mn bmbcs suggested that cd2 might be removed via precipitation and complexation because of the inorganic compounds in ash these results confirmed that ball milling and fe mn binary metal oxide modification could greatly improve the cd2 adsorption capacity of biochar the adsorption capacity of fe mn bmrh was strikingly larger than those of the other three fe mn bmbcs which could be attributed to its markedly larger ssa 331 50 m2 g 1 langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the adsorption isotherms data fig 5 and the related isotherm parameters were summarized in table 3 based on the r 2 values the data of cd2 adsorption by pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were better fitted with the langmuir isotherm model than the freundlich isotherm model implying that the cd2 adsorption was monolayer instead of multilayer adsorption 34 51 additionally the constant n calculated by the freundlich model was between 1 and 10 which indicated that cd2 were easily captured onto the biochar surface 52 53 3 2 3 desorption and reusability of fe mn bmbcs the five cycle adsorption desorption experiment showed that adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs decreased with each cycle fig 6 probably because the chemisorption between cd2 and fe mn bmbcs was irreversible and adsorption sites decreased after the first adsorption desorption cycle 53 55 it was worth noting that the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs decreased significantly by 54 70 after the first cycle but very little since the second cycle fig 6 after 5 cycles the fe mn bmbcs maintained 41 70 of the first adsorption capacity which were still larger than those of the pristine biochars these results indicated that modified biochar had high reusability and could be regarded as environmentally friendly resource and energy conversing efficient adsorbents for cd2 removal 3 3 effect of environmental factors on cd2 adsorption 3 3 1 effect of solution ph on cd2 adsorption in the solution ph value range of 3 8 fe mn bmrh had the highest adsorption capacity whereas fe mn bmcb had the lowest adsorption capacity fig 7a at ph 8 cd2 adsorption capacities of fe mn bmrh 67 17 mg g 1 and fe mn bmjx 59 47 mg g 1 were notably higher than those of fe mn bmdy 51 63 mg g 1 and fe mn bmcb 47 91 mg g 1 when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh increased by 39 14 mg g 1 36 07 mg g 1 34 44 mg g 1 and 37 10 mg g 1 respectively and the results were consistent with the findings of wu et al 11 and van et al 55 at low ph the surface binding sites of biochar are occupied by the positively charged h ions producing repulsion towards the also positively charged cd2 ions 11 42 at high ph the deprotonation of biochar surface functional groups is enhanced resulting in the precipitation of cd2 with oh 56 in addition cd2 might co precipitate or complex with oh po4 3 and co3 2 57 58 therefore the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were higher under alkaline conditions implying that chemical precipitation and complexation might be involved in cd2 adsorption solution ph affects the zero potential point of biochar and the electrostatic interaction between biochar and metals by influencing the surface charge of biochar and the valence state of metal ions 59 60 in this study the surface zero potential points ph phiep of the fe mn bmbcs were 2 18 fe mn bmjx 3 06 fe mn bmdy 2 57 fe mn bmcb and 1 73 fe mn bmrh fig 7b when solution ph phiep biochar surface is positively charged 61 as a result the nucleophilicity of functional groups is reduced and electrostatic repulsion is produced between biochar and metal ions 62 therefore the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were small at low solution ph when solution ph phiep the deprotonation occurs on biochar surface and becomes stronger with the increasing ph value 63 consequently biochar surface is negatively charged and cd2 is adsorbed via electrostatic attraction 63 this explained the large adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs at high solution ph value 3 3 2 effect of ionic strength on cd2 adsorption in general metal adsorption behavior at different ionic strengths of the electrolyte could be a clue to the potential mechanism of cd2 adsorption 64 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs increased by 7 44 25 94 with the ionic strength from 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 001 mol l 1 nano3 but decreased by 11 76 20 32 with the ionic strength from 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 05 mol l 1 nano3 fig 8a in other words cd2 adsorption was significantly inhibited with the increase in ionic strength the possible reason was that at high ionic strength the electrostatic attraction and the ion exchange between na and the surface of fe mn bmbcs were enhanced and more na competed with cd2 for adsorption sites as well 65 66 in addition a thick hydration shell would form on the surface of fe mn bmbcs after na was adsorbed which hindered the re adsorption of cd2 the fact that cd2 adsorption was greatly influenced by ionic strength suggested that cation exchange surface complexation and electrostatic interaction could be the mechanisms of cd2 adsorption by the fe mn bmbcs 66 3 3 3 effect of coexisting ions on cd2 adsorption in this work the effect of different valence metal ions na ca2 and al3 on cd2 adsorption by four fe mn bmbcs was investigated higher valence metal ions exerted a stronger inhibiting effect on cd2 adsorption with the order of inhibiting effect being al3 ca2 na fig 8b the adsorption capacities decreased by 16 46 18 65 when the background solution changed from 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 01 mol l 1 ca no3 2 the adsorption capacities were 38 65 lower at 0 01 mol l 1 al no3 3 than at 0 01 mol l 1 ca no3 2 the results were possibly due to the different properties of metals and their different affinity to the active sites of biochar 67 trivalent cations are more likely than divalent cations to form inner sphere complexes whereas monovalent cations are more likely to form outer sphere complexes 68 in addition higher valent cations form weaker covalent bonds and undergo weaker hydration which is favorable for their interaction with the sorbent surface 69 4 the mechanisms of cd2 adsorption on fe mn bmbcs the surface charge of biochar was variable at different solution ph value and fe mn bmbcs had large adsorption capacities at high solution ph value which indicated that electrostatic interactions and co precipitate or complex with oh po4 3 and co3 2 58 might occur between cd2 and biochar 70 in addition cd2 adsorption was increasingly restrained by the increasing ionic strength which proved that cation exchange and surface complexation might be the mechanisms of cd2 adsorption by fe mn bmbcs 66 the xps spectra of rh and fe mn bmrh were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanism of cd2 on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs figs 9 10 and s4 s7 the c o c peak in rh spectrum only shifted slightly fig s4a c after adsorption indicating that cd2 was mainly fixed on rh via physisorption this result was consistent with the kinetics fitting result as for fe mn bmrh the peak at 287 ev disappeared after cd2 adsorption fig s4d which was primarily due to the formation of chemical bonds between cd2 and co similarly new peaks at 534 19 ev for rh and 533 16 ev for fe mn bmrh appeared after cd2 adsorption and the contents of oxygen containing functional groups decreased according to the o 1s spectra fig 10 which might be due to the formation of cdo bond the bonding between cd and o was confirmed by the cd 3d xps spectrum fig s5 furthermore the peaks at 405 8 ev and 406 4 ev in the cd 3d spectrum of rh corresponded to cdco3 and cdo respectively and the peaks at 405 3 ev 406 3 ev and 406 9 ev in the cd 3d spectrum of fe mn bmrh were attributed to cd oh 2 cdco3 and cdo respectively 32 this result confirmed that the cd2 adsorption mechanism was cd2 precipitation with specific ligands minerals on biochar 69 71 or co precipitation with the anions e g co3 2 and oh adhering to biochar surface 72 73 in addition the fe and mn contents of fe mn bmrh decreased after cd2 adsorption table s2 the peaks of fe 2p and mn 2p red shifted obviously after cd2 adsorption onto fe mn bmrh figs s6 and s7 which implied coordination reaction between cd2 and fe mn o 69 the decreased intensity of fe mn o peak in the ftir spectrum could support this inference fig 11 in the ftir spectra of fe mn bmbcs before and after cd2 adsorption the oh peak between 3433 and 3451 cm 1 the aromatic stretching vibration peak of c c c o at approximately 1630 cm 1 and the stretching vibration peak of carboxyl co at approximately 1380 cm 1 30 41 red shifted and the intensity decreased sharply after cd2 adsorption fig 11 these changes in peak position and intensity indicated that cd2 and functional groups cooh oh co o etc formed monodentate or bidentate inner sphere complexes such as coo cd and cd o cd 30 74 or occurred ion exchange typically between cd2 and h 30 in addition the changes in aromatic functional groups could be attributed to cd2 π interaction 42 74 which was another reason for higher adsorption capacity of fe mn bmrh compared with rh in summary the potential mechanisms of cd2 adsorption by the fe mn bmbcs include a cation exchange between cd2 and the cations in fe mn bmbcs b electrostatic interaction between cd2 and the negatively charged functional groups on the surface of fe mn bmbcs at different ph c complexation of oxygen containing functional groups on fe mn bmbcs with cd2 d cd2 π interaction e precipitation with minerals in biochar 5 conclusions in this study fe mn binary metal oxide biochar nano composites fe mn bmbcs were successfully prepared which had much larger surface areas 226 50 331 50 m2 g 1 and pore volumes 0 33 0 36 cm3 g 1 than pristine biochars the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were 5 1 5 3 6 1 and 4 8 times higher than those of pristine biochars respectively in addition fe mn bmbcs had great stability and reusability of the four types of fe mn bmbcs fe mn bmrh displayed the largest cd2 adsorption capacity the feo and mno groups complexed with cd2 significantly increased the adsorption capacity of biochar the langmuir model and pseudo second order model well fitted the adsorption data suggesting that cd2 adsorption on the fe mn bmbcs was monolayer chemisorption surface complexation cation exchange cd2 π interaction precipitation and electrostatic attraction were the dominant mechanisms of cd2 adsorption on the fe mn bmbcs this study demonstrates that fe mn bmbc is a promising and environmentally friendly adsorbent for the removal of cd2 from aqueous solutions future studies can be focused on its application in removal of other heavy metals credit authorship contribution statement jie qu formal analysis draft and review the manuscript conceptualization methodology

12618,biochar has been widely used as an adsorbent to remove cadmium cd from polluted waters because of its high specific surface area and rich functional groups efforts have been made to modify biochar to further improve its metal adsorption capacity in this work biochars prepared using cotton straw corn straw and rice husk were first modified with ball milling and iron manganese fe mn oxides to prepare fe mn binary metal oxide ball milled biochar fe mn bmbcs compared with pristine biochars fe mn bmbcs had rough surface with deposits of fe mn oxide nanoparticles larger specific surface areas 226 50 331 50 m2 g 1 and more oxygen containing functional groups the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of cd2 on both the pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were best described by the pseudo second order model and the langmuir model respectively indicating that the adsorption of cd2 was primarily monolayer chemisorption the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were 4 8 6 1 times higher than those of pristine biochars respectively when the solution ionic strength and valence of coexisting cation increased the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs decreased because of cation competition in contrast the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs increased with the increasing solution ph value complexation with oxygen bearing functional groups ion exchange cd2 π interaction and chemical precipitation were the main mechanisms of cd2 adsorption on fe mn bmbcs therefore fe mn bmbcs prepared with different agricultural wastes have different cd2 adsorption capacities and can be used as environmentally friendly and effective adsorbents for cd2 removal from aqueous media graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ball milling manganese ferrite cadmium remediation adsorption mechanism data availability all data generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article 1 introduction cadmium cd can magnify along the food chain and be harmful to human health due to its high toxicity 1 the maximum allowable cd2 concentration in drinking water set by the world health organization who is 0 005 mg l 1 2 3 the removal of cd2 from drinking water and industrial wastewater has been one of the focuses of environmental science and engineering 4 6 of the numerous technologies for cd2 removal the adsorption technology has advantages of low cost and high efficiency 7 8 many adsorbents can be derived from various agricultural and industrial wastes 9 10 therefore developing adsorbents of low cost and high adsorption capacity has currently become a research hotspot 2 11 12 biochar is a solid material obtained by thermal treatment of various biomass without oxygen or with low oxygen 13 biochars prepared from different materials have different physicochemical properties 14 15 dai et al 16 showed that the physicochemical properties of biochars derived from rice straw eucalyptus leaves and vetiver grass were influenced by their mineral constituents because of its porous structure large specific surface area ssa and high functional group content biochar has been widely used as a low cost adsorbent to efficiently remove heavy metals from polluted waters 17 19 recently biochar is commonly modified in various ways to improve its ssa and functional group content so as to further improve its high metal adsorption capacity 10 20 21 ball milling technology is a valid method of grinding solid materials into nano sized particles to produce nano structured materials with unique properties 22 24 in comparison with chemical impregnation ball milling technology is an efficient and environmentally friendly method for biochar modification without the addition of chemical reagents several studies have demonstrated that compared with pristine biochar ball milled biochar bmbc has higher metal adsorption capacity because of larger ssa and more functional groups 25 27 recently researchers further modify biochar with metal oxides to produce metal oxide biochar nano composites and use such composites to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions 28 30 produced with fe mn oxides and biochar fe mn oxide biochar composites are of low cost and low toxicity and have promising potential in heavy metal removal from aqueous media 31 up till now many studies have been conducted on cd2 removal from aqueous solutions using ball milled biochar or metal oxide modified biochar but few have attempted to modify biochar combined ball milling technology and metal oxide modification especially used biochar derived from different agricultural wastes in this study bmbcs derived from cotton straw corn straw and rice husk were modified with fe mn oxide to obtain fe mn binary metal oxide ball milled biochar fe mn bmbcs the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the properties of fe mn bmbcs prepared from different agricultural wastes 2 to determine the cd2 adsorption capacities of the fe mn bmbcs compared with pristine biochars and 3 to elucidate the mechanisms of cd2 removal by the fe mn bmbcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of pristine and modified biochars the cotton straw corn straw and rice husk used for biochar preparation were taken from farmlands in shandong province china according to raw materials used the following four pristine biochars were obtained after 2 h pyrolysis at 500 c under n2 air protection see esi 1 for detailed procedures jx prepared with cotton straw dy prepared with cotton straw from an alkaline cotton field cb prepared with corn straw and rh prepared with rice husk the biochars were subsequently ball milled with a planetary ball mill qm 10 15 shanghai precision instrument co ltd china at 300 rpm and a biochar to ball mass ratio of 1 100 for 6 h the ball milled jx dy cb and rh were referred to as bmjx bmdy bmcb and bmrh respectively finally bmjx bmdy bmcb and bmrh were modified with fe mn oxide i e spinel manganese ferrite using the co precipitation method as described in esi 2 30 briefly 1 g bmbc was added to 100 ml 0 3 mol l 1 feso4 solution then 100 ml 0 1 mol l 1 kmno4 solution was added while stirring the solution ph was adjusted to 10 with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solution after aged at room temperature for 3 h the suspension solution was centrifuged the sediment was washed with deionized water and vacuum dried at 35 c

based on weight loss after a pyrolysis at 800 c biochar ph and conductivity were measured using a ph meter fe28 mettler toledo international inc usa and a conductivity meter dds 307 shanghai lei si instrument co ltd china respectively biochars were degassed for 3 h at 200 c for ssa and pore size determination using a gas sorption analyzer nova 1200e quantachrome usa based on the brunauer emmett teller bet method the micromorphology and micro composition of biochars were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds su8020 hitachi limited japan respectively biochar samples were mixed and pelleted with dehydrated kbr before being scanned between 4000 and 400 cm 1 with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa for analysis of surface functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo escalab 250 xi thermo fisher scientific usa was used to examine the surface composition and valence states of biochars with the c 1s peak at 284 8 ev serving as the internal standard calibration peak 2 3 adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate and average values of the results are presented the cd2 solution used was prepared by diluting the 1000 mg l 1 cd2 cd no3 2 4h2o stock solution with 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 i e the background electrolyte for all adsorption experiments biochar dosage was 1 0 g l 1 the initial cd2 concentration was 100 mg l 1 the solution ph was 5 the background solution was 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 and the temperature was 298 k unless otherwise stated in addition all supernatants were obtained by filtering with 0 45 μm filters and mixed with 200 μl 50 hno3 before stored for further analysis a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer pinaacle 900f perkinelmer inc usa was used for cd2 quantification for the adsorption kinetics experiment biochar was added to 100 mg l 1 cd2 solution ph 5 0 at 1 0 g l 1 while shaking on a horizontal shaker at 180 rpm and 298 k cd2 concentration in the solution was quantified after 0 3 5 10 20 40 60 90 120 150 180 240 360 480 720 and 960 min for the adsorption isotherm experiment different initial concentrations of cd2 30 50 70 100 120 150 and 180 mg l 1 were used and the equilibrium time was 12 h based on the result of the adsorption kinetics experiment the other experimental conditions were the same as those in the adsorption kinetics experiment to evaluate the stability and reusability of fe mn bmbcs an adsorption desorption experiment was carried out after cd2 adsorption the mixture was filtered and fe mn bmbcs were added into 0 1 m hcl solution for 10 h with stirring rinsed with deionized water several times and dried at 60 c before another 4 cycles of adsorption desorption both adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted under the same conditions 298 k ph 5 0 150 rpm and with the same solid liquid ratio parallel experiments were conducted to determine the experimental error the effect of solution ph on the adsorption capacity of fe mn bmbcs was investigated with initial solution ph set at 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 the effect of background ionic strength was conducted with ionic strength set at 0 001 0 005 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 mol l 1 nano3 to explore the effect of coexisting ion on cd2 removal nano3 ca no3 2 and al no3 3 0 01 mol l 1 solutions were used as electrolytes 2 4 statistical analyses the adsorption capacity calculation formula adsorption kinetics fitting models pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and intra particle diffusion model and adsorption isotherm fitting models the langmuir model and freundlich model are listed in esi 3 statistical analysis was performed using excel 2010 the origin 8 6 software was used for data analyses and figure plotting 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar characteristics 3 1 1 physicochemical properties the sbet of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh was 226 50 268 85 264 48 and 331 50 m2 g 1 respectively which was 9 16 times higher than that of the corresponding pristine biochar 4 02 19 13 28 54 and 30 35 m2 g 1 respectively fig s1 and table 1 similarly the fe mn bmbcs had larger mesopore volumes 0 33 0 32 0 33 and 0 36 cm3 g 1 than pristine biochars 0 02 0 006 0 03 and 0 03 cm3 g 1 this might be because the impurities that blocked the pores were removed and some micropores were transformed into mesopores or macropores during ball milling and modification 32 34 however the average pore sizes of pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were 6 49 7 61 nm and 4 16 5 21 nm respectively indicating that fe mn binary metal oxide particles had been loaded onto the bmbcs and taken up some of the pore space the fe mn bmbcs had a higher ash content but a lower ph than their corresponding pristine biochars table 1 which was related to the loading of fe mn oxide among the four pristine biochars dy had the highest ash content 17 67 and ph 10 73 which was likely due to the high alkali metals contents of its raw material taken from an alkaline cotton field 35 fe mn bmrh had a higher ash content 23 14 than the other three fe mn bmbcs which was attributed to its high fe mn oxide loading similar to previous studies the opposite trends of ph and ash content might be due to the accumulation of cations and carbonates on biochars 36 37 the fe on fe mn bmbcs reacted with oh to form feoh and feoh2 groups resulting in the ph decrease 38 in addition after ball milling and fe mn oxide modification the electrical conductivities of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh were significantly improved to 449 48 623 03 670 8 and 802 43 μs cm 1 respectively 3 1 2 morphological and structural features of fe mn bmbcs the morphological and structural features of pristine biochars bmbcs and fe mn bmbcs were different fig 1 the four pristine biochars showed compact biochar plates with smooth surface fig 1a1 a4 whereas the four bmbcs presented small biochar fragments with rough surface fig 1b1 b4 a previous study also found that ball milling altered particle size and surface morphology 39 with its high energy shear force and rapid extrusion 40 the smaller particle size after ball milling would be accompanied by a larger ssa which was evident in the bet results table 1 the four fe mn bmbcs showed rough surface with deposits of small fe mn oxide particles fig 1c1 c4 as proved by the eds analysis fig 1d f 3 1 3 ftir spectra of fe mn bmbcs in the ftir spectra of all pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs the two peaks near 3440 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 were due to the vibration of oh and the stretching vibration of aromatic c c c o double bonds respectively 30 41 these functional groups are active sites to bind cd2 additionally in the ftir spectra of all pristine biochars except dy the peak due to the stretching vibration of co was observed at approximately 1000 cm 1 32 42 for jx and rh the peak near 1380 cm 1 fig 2a d was attributed to the stretching vibration of carboxyl co 42 compared with pristine biochars the bands of fe mn bmbcs were stronger and broader and the c c c o band red shifted indicating that the fe mn bmbcs had more functional groups and a higher potential to adsorb cd2 the peak near 560 cm 1 in the spectra of fe mn bmbcs was attributed to the vibration of fe o mn o 30 32 indicating that the bmbcs had been successfully loaded with fe mn oxide 3 2 adsorption behavior of cd2 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics cd2 was rapidly adsorbed by both pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs in the first 20 min fig 3 then the adsorption gradually slowed down and reached an equilibrium after 4 h for pristine biochars and 3 h for fe mn bmbcs the adsorption rate changes were due to the gradual saturation of the adsorption sites on biochar surface 43 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were much higher than those of pristine biochars which was ascribed to larger ssa and more functional groups of the former 44 in addition fe mn bmrh had the highest adsorption capacity 53 92 mg g 1 among four fe mn bmbcs which was due to its larger ssa table 1 and more oxygen containing functional groups than the other three fig 2 the kinetics of cd2 adsorption on dy cb fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh was better fitted with the pseudo second order model r 2 values of 0 969 0 983 0 998 0 981 and 0 986 respectively than with the pseudo first order model r 2 values of 0 955 0 958 0 974 0 930 and 0 944 respectively table 2 this illustrated that chemisorption was responsible for cd2 adsorption by these biochars 45 47 as for jx rh and fe mn bmjx the adsorption kinetics was slightly better fitted with the pseudo first order model indicating that physisorption was mainly responsible for cd2 adsorption by these biochars 48 49 furthermore an adsorption process might be of intra particle diffusion or film diffusion or both the plot of q t versus t 0 5 showed a linear pattern of cd2 adsorption on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs which including a rapid stage a slow stage and an equilibrium stage fig 4 obviously the second step did not go through the origin indicating that surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion might both influence the cd2 adsorption rate 50 the dynamics of cd2 adsorption on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were well fitted with the intra particle diffusion model with r 2 0 90 in the second adsorption stage the cd2 diffusion rates for fe mn bmbcs k id2 0 640 1 30 mg g min0 5 1 were faster than those for pristine biochars k id2 0 214 0 622 mg g min0 5 1 indicating that cd2 was more rapidly adsorbed by the former in summary cd2 adsorption on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs began with rapid adsorption on the surface boundary layer followed by intra particle diffusion 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption amount of cd2 on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs increased with the increasing initial cd2 concentration figs 5 s2 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were significantly higher than those of pristine biochars fig 5 for example when the equilibrium concentration of cd2 was 100 mg l 1 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh were 44 75 34 65 32 54 and 55 76 mg g 1 respectively while those of jx dy cb and rh were 9 57 12 3 15 61 and 12 15 mg g 1 respectively obviously pristine biochars prepared with different raw materials had different adsorption capacities and fe mn bmbcs had higher adsorption capacities than pristine biochars the previous studies table s1 also showed that the biochar prepared with different biomass had different adsorption capacity and the modified biochar had better adsorption capacity which was similar to this work compared with conventional biochar and fe mn oxide for cd2 removal fe mn bmbcs had higher adsorption capacities therefore fe mn bmbc could be regarded as a noteworthy and potential adsorbent for the cd2 removal the higher adsorption capacities and removal efficiencies figs 5 s3 of fe mn bmbcs compared with pristine biochars were attributed to the increases in ssa and functional groups after ball milling and fe mn oxide modification combined with the previous analysis of characterization results the high ash contents of the fe mn bmbcs suggested that cd2 might be removed via precipitation and complexation because of the inorganic compounds in ash these results confirmed that ball milling and fe mn binary metal oxide modification could greatly improve the cd2 adsorption capacity of biochar the adsorption capacity of fe mn bmrh was strikingly larger than those of the other three fe mn bmbcs which could be attributed to its markedly larger ssa 331 50 m2 g 1 langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the adsorption isotherms data fig 5 and the related isotherm parameters were summarized in table 3 based on the r 2 values the data of cd2 adsorption by pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs were better fitted with the langmuir isotherm model than the freundlich isotherm model implying that the cd2 adsorption was monolayer instead of multilayer adsorption 34 51 additionally the constant n calculated by the freundlich model was between 1 and 10 which indicated that cd2 were easily captured onto the biochar surface 52 53 3 2 3 desorption and reusability of fe mn bmbcs the five cycle adsorption desorption experiment showed that adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs decreased with each cycle fig 6 probably because the chemisorption between cd2 and fe mn bmbcs was irreversible and adsorption sites decreased after the first adsorption desorption cycle 53 55 it was worth noting that the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs decreased significantly by 54 70 after the first cycle but very little since the second cycle fig 6 after 5 cycles the fe mn bmbcs maintained 41 70 of the first adsorption capacity which were still larger than those of the pristine biochars these results indicated that modified biochar had high reusability and could be regarded as environmentally friendly resource and energy conversing efficient adsorbents for cd2 removal 3 3 effect of environmental factors on cd2 adsorption 3 3 1 effect of solution ph on cd2 adsorption in the solution ph value range of 3 8 fe mn bmrh had the highest adsorption capacity whereas fe mn bmcb had the lowest adsorption capacity fig 7a at ph 8 cd2 adsorption capacities of fe mn bmrh 67 17 mg g 1 and fe mn bmjx 59 47 mg g 1 were notably higher than those of fe mn bmdy 51 63 mg g 1 and fe mn bmcb 47 91 mg g 1 when the solution ph increased from 3 to 8 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmjx fe mn bmdy fe mn bmcb and fe mn bmrh increased by 39 14 mg g 1 36 07 mg g 1 34 44 mg g 1 and 37 10 mg g 1 respectively and the results were consistent with the findings of wu et al 11 and van et al 55 at low ph the surface binding sites of biochar are occupied by the positively charged h ions producing repulsion towards the also positively charged cd2 ions 11 42 at high ph the deprotonation of biochar surface functional groups is enhanced resulting in the precipitation of cd2 with oh 56 in addition cd2 might co precipitate or complex with oh po4 3 and co3 2 57 58 therefore the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were higher under alkaline conditions implying that chemical precipitation and complexation might be involved in cd2 adsorption solution ph affects the zero potential point of biochar and the electrostatic interaction between biochar and metals by influencing the surface charge of biochar and the valence state of metal ions 59 60 in this study the surface zero potential points ph phiep of the fe mn bmbcs were 2 18 fe mn bmjx 3 06 fe mn bmdy 2 57 fe mn bmcb and 1 73 fe mn bmrh fig 7b when solution ph phiep biochar surface is positively charged 61 as a result the nucleophilicity of functional groups is reduced and electrostatic repulsion is produced between biochar and metal ions 62 therefore the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were small at low solution ph when solution ph phiep the deprotonation occurs on biochar surface and becomes stronger with the increasing ph value 63 consequently biochar surface is negatively charged and cd2 is adsorbed via electrostatic attraction 63 this explained the large adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs at high solution ph value 3 3 2 effect of ionic strength on cd2 adsorption in general metal adsorption behavior at different ionic strengths of the electrolyte could be a clue to the potential mechanism of cd2 adsorption 64 the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs increased by 7 44 25 94 with the ionic strength from 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 001 mol l 1 nano3 but decreased by 11 76 20 32 with the ionic strength from 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 05 mol l 1 nano3 fig 8a in other words cd2 adsorption was significantly inhibited with the increase in ionic strength the possible reason was that at high ionic strength the electrostatic attraction and the ion exchange between na and the surface of fe mn bmbcs were enhanced and more na competed with cd2 for adsorption sites as well 65 66 in addition a thick hydration shell would form on the surface of fe mn bmbcs after na was adsorbed which hindered the re adsorption of cd2 the fact that cd2 adsorption was greatly influenced by ionic strength suggested that cation exchange surface complexation and electrostatic interaction could be the mechanisms of cd2 adsorption by the fe mn bmbcs 66 3 3 3 effect of coexisting ions on cd2 adsorption in this work the effect of different valence metal ions na ca2 and al3 on cd2 adsorption by four fe mn bmbcs was investigated higher valence metal ions exerted a stronger inhibiting effect on cd2 adsorption with the order of inhibiting effect being al3 ca2 na fig 8b the adsorption capacities decreased by 16 46 18 65 when the background solution changed from 0 01 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 01 mol l 1 ca no3 2 the adsorption capacities were 38 65 lower at 0 01 mol l 1 al no3 3 than at 0 01 mol l 1 ca no3 2 the results were possibly due to the different properties of metals and their different affinity to the active sites of biochar 67 trivalent cations are more likely than divalent cations to form inner sphere complexes whereas monovalent cations are more likely to form outer sphere complexes 68 in addition higher valent cations form weaker covalent bonds and undergo weaker hydration which is favorable for their interaction with the sorbent surface 69 4 the mechanisms of cd2 adsorption on fe mn bmbcs the surface charge of biochar was variable at different solution ph value and fe mn bmbcs had large adsorption capacities at high solution ph value which indicated that electrostatic interactions and co precipitate or complex with oh po4 3 and co3 2 58 might occur between cd2 and biochar 70 in addition cd2 adsorption was increasingly restrained by the increasing ionic strength which proved that cation exchange and surface complexation might be the mechanisms of cd2 adsorption by fe mn bmbcs 66 the xps spectra of rh and fe mn bmrh were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanism of cd2 on pristine biochars and fe mn bmbcs figs 9 10 and s4 s7 the c o c peak in rh spectrum only shifted slightly fig s4a c after adsorption indicating that cd2 was mainly fixed on rh via physisorption this result was consistent with the kinetics fitting result as for fe mn bmrh the peak at 287 ev disappeared after cd2 adsorption fig s4d which was primarily due to the formation of chemical bonds between cd2 and co similarly new peaks at 534 19 ev for rh and 533 16 ev for fe mn bmrh appeared after cd2 adsorption and the contents of oxygen containing functional groups decreased according to the o 1s spectra fig 10 which might be due to the formation of cdo bond the bonding between cd and o was confirmed by the cd 3d xps spectrum fig s5 furthermore the peaks at 405 8 ev and 406 4 ev in the cd 3d spectrum of rh corresponded to cdco3 and cdo respectively and the peaks at 405 3 ev 406 3 ev and 406 9 ev in the cd 3d spectrum of fe mn bmrh were attributed to cd oh 2 cdco3 and cdo respectively 32 this result confirmed that the cd2 adsorption mechanism was cd2 precipitation with specific ligands minerals on biochar 69 71 or co precipitation with the anions e g co3 2 and oh adhering to biochar surface 72 73 in addition the fe and mn contents of fe mn bmrh decreased after cd2 adsorption table s2 the peaks of fe 2p and mn 2p red shifted obviously after cd2 adsorption onto fe mn bmrh figs s6 and s7 which implied coordination reaction between cd2 and fe mn o 69 the decreased intensity of fe mn o peak in the ftir spectrum could support this inference fig 11 in the ftir spectra of fe mn bmbcs before and after cd2 adsorption the oh peak between 3433 and 3451 cm 1 the aromatic stretching vibration peak of c c c o at approximately 1630 cm 1 and the stretching vibration peak of carboxyl co at approximately 1380 cm 1 30 41 red shifted and the intensity decreased sharply after cd2 adsorption fig 11 these changes in peak position and intensity indicated that cd2 and functional groups cooh oh co o etc formed monodentate or bidentate inner sphere complexes such as coo cd and cd o cd 30 74 or occurred ion exchange typically between cd2 and h 30 in addition the changes in aromatic functional groups could be attributed to cd2 π interaction 42 74 which was another reason for higher adsorption capacity of fe mn bmrh compared with rh in summary the potential mechanisms of cd2 adsorption by the fe mn bmbcs include a cation exchange between cd2 and the cations in fe mn bmbcs b electrostatic interaction between cd2 and the negatively charged functional groups on the surface of fe mn bmbcs at different ph c complexation of oxygen containing functional groups on fe mn bmbcs with cd2 d cd2 π interaction e precipitation with minerals in biochar 5 conclusions in this study fe mn binary metal oxide biochar nano composites fe mn bmbcs were successfully prepared which had much larger surface areas 226 50 331 50 m2 g 1 and pore volumes 0 33 0 36 cm3 g 1 than pristine biochars the adsorption capacities of fe mn bmbcs were 5 1 5 3 6 1 and 4 8 times higher than those of pristine biochars respectively in addition fe mn bmbcs had great stability and reusability of the four types of fe mn bmbcs fe mn bmrh displayed the largest cd2 adsorption capacity the feo and mno groups complexed with cd2 significantly increased the adsorption capacity of biochar the langmuir model and pseudo second order model well fitted the adsorption data suggesting that cd2 adsorption on the fe mn bmbcs was monolayer chemisorption surface complexation cation exchange cd2 π interaction precipitation and electrostatic attraction were the dominant mechanisms of cd2 adsorption on the fe mn bmbcs this study demonstrates that fe mn bmbc is a promising and environmentally friendly adsorbent for the removal of cd2 from aqueous solutions future studies can be focused on its application in removal of other heavy metals credit authorship contribution statement jie qu formal analysis draft and review the manuscript conceptualization methodology

12619,a novel porogen added ammonium phosphomolybdate polyacrylonitrile amp pan n20 was prepared to remove cs from geothermal water compared with traditional amp pan porous amp pan n20 beads have a smaller particle size larger adsorption capacity and faster adsorption rate the adsorption batch experiments were carried out with the research objects adsorbent contact time dosage ph value initial cs concentration temperature and competing ions the results showed that amp pan n20 could effectively adsorb cs in a wide ph range and high concentration of competing ions remarkably the adsorption performance hardly decreased after ten cycles of adsorption in addition the column adsorption tests were obtained using cs containing geothermal water the results showed that the adsorption breakthrough time could be as long as 60 h flow rate q 2 ml min 1 bed height h 8 cm and the maximum dynamic adsorption capacity was 25 62 mg g 1 under the thomas model in addition the amp pan n20 maintained good stability after a long time of adsorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorbent ion exchange amp pan composite porogenic agent cs removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the remediation of radioactive wastewater has attracted widespread attention from research institutions and governments worldwide especially after the fukushima nuclear power plant accident in japan which resulted in the uncontrolled release of fission products into the environment among many fission products 137cs is one of the most hazardous radioisotopes because of its gamma ray emission long half life 30 2 years and good water solubility 1 2 furthermore the accumulation of 137cs in organisms can cause dna damage 3 albinism and tumors 4 however 137cs can also be used as a gamma radiation source for sterilization and cancer radiotherapy therefore developing effective technologies to remove and extract 137cs from nuclear wastewater is essential for the sustainable development of nuclear power nowadays various methods have been extensively studied to remove radioactive from aqueous solutions including precipitation 5 solvent extraction 6 electrochemical 7 and adsorption among them adsorption has demonstrated good efficiency in removing cesium and easy operation so extensive research has been conducted on various adsorbents examples of these are polymer resins 8 9 natural zeolites 10 titanosilicates 11 prussian blue p b analogues 12 13 and ammonium molybdophosphate amp 14 16 among the previously developed adsorbents amp nh4 3p mo3o10 4 3h2o have demonstrated their good selectivity high adsorption capacity 17 and reusability so it has been extensively studied previous investigations indicated that the pmo12o40 3 in amp is a cage like structure and both cs and nh4 can be adsorbed at oxygen atoms on the surface of pmo12o40 3 this result allows nh4 to exchange with adsorbed cs without destroying the crystalline structure 18 therefore the adsorbed cs can be eluted with ammonium salt solution for cs recovery and adsorbent reuse which is very important for industrial applications however the microcrystalline structure of amp makes it challenging to recover after adsorption which limits its application in industrial aqueous solutions therefore many researchers have studied materials used to immobilize amp such as alumina 19 mesoporous silica 20 sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 16 and 21 while significant progress has been achieved most suffer from the following problems inferior acid or alkali tolerance relatively low adsorption performance complex synthesis steps which involve high temperature operation polyacrylonitrile pan with series of advantages like excellent molding ability solvent resistance outstanding thermo mechanical stability and strong tensile properties making it an appropriate polymer matrix for amp at present ammonium molybdophosphate polyacrylonitrile amp pan has been studied by many researchers due to its good adsorption efficiency park et al 22 investigated the removal of co2 sr2 and cs from radioactive laundry wastewater by amp pan and it consistently maintained high selectivity for cs in the presence of surfactants todd et al 23 demonstrated that the amp pan composite adsorbent possesses a superior ability to remove cesium from concentrated acid tank waste streams although amp pan has been proven to have effective adsorption performance in acidic and high salt radioactive wastewater its slow adsorption rate and low adsorption capacity restrict its further application and promotion hence several porogenic agents were screened in this work and their dosages were investigated for the first time to address these problems the results showed that the pore forming amp pan microspheres exhibited faster reaction kinetics and higher adsorption capacity fixed bed adsorption experiments are considered the vane of industrial application which can provide theoretical and technical support for practical production life and early warning of process operation conditions 24 breakthrough curve configuration and breakthrough times are two important indicators of continuous adsorption kinetics in fixed beds not much data has been reported on the penetration curve s dependence on these parameters e g bed height flow rate for the adsorption of cs on amp pan therefore in this work non radioactive geothermal water cs 17 58 mg l 1 was selected as the simulated wastewater to test the adsorption performance of the adsorbent under dynamic conditions finally the best process parameters were obtained which provides some theoretical support for future industrialization in this study we prepared several adsorbents by adding different porogenic agents to synthesize amp pan we determined the appropriate porogen by comparing the adsorption efficiency of other adsorbents after characterizing the physicochemical properties the optimized screening adsorbents were used to adsorb cs from geothermal water the adsorption isotherm thermodynamics and kinetics of the adsorption process and the adsorption mechanism were explored the effect of different concentrations of desorption agents on desorption was also investigated and the adsorbent was used for multiple cycles of regeneration adsorption to test the cycle stability and durability of the adsorbent moreover the newly synthesized amp pan was used in the dynamic adsorption of cs containing geothermal water to study its performance on cs removal in natural water 2 experimental 2 1 experiment materials ammonium phosphomolybdate amp nh4 3pmo12o40 3h2o 99 was obtained from the aladdin biochemical technology co polyacrylonitrile pan powder 98 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 98 was purchased from shanghai macleans biochemical technology co ltd tween 80 was supplied by merck company cesium chloride was provided by the mreda technology co ltd sodium chloride potassium chloride ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride was obtained from sigma aldrich inc 2 2 synthesis of amp pan beads the synthesis process of amp pan beads is shown in fig 1 first 0 2 g of tween 80 and 5 g of amp were added to 25 ml of dmso after stirring at 250 r min 1 and 50 c for 0 5 h 2 g of pan was added to the solution and then the mixture was stirred at 50 c and 500 r min 1 for 6 h a homogeneous yellow gel was finally obtained next the mixture was added dropwise into deionized water with a syringe to get beads in addition in order to strengthen the stability of the beads stirring was required for 4 h finally the obtained amp pan beads were washed with deionized water and then dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h 2 3 preparation of porous amp pan the effect of different porogenic agents on cs adsorption was investigated three porogenic agents c16mim cl and ctab as ionic liquid porogen peg 6000 as water soluble polymer porogen and nh4hco3 as gas producing porogen were used the names and properties of different porogenic agents are summarized in table 1 the porous amp pan was prepared by the same method except that a certain amount of porogen was added to the dmso during synthesis nh4hco3 porogen amp pan mixture was dropped into the 0 1 mol l 1 hcl solution to generate co2 air bubbles in the beads and other types of amp pan were still dropped into the water to form beads 2 4 characterization the surface morphology of amp pan beads was evaluated using surface scanning electron microscope image analysis sem jsm it300lv japan ft ir spectra were analyzed in the 4000 400 cm 1 with 16 cumulative scans nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa the element distribution and content of the samples before and after adsorption were measured by an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx ea1000vx japan instruments the porous surface properties of the adsorbent were determined by the surface porosity analyzer micromeritics asap 2020m usa n2 adsorption desorption was performed at 77 k for 5 h and the surface area was assessed using brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 5 batch adsorption 2 534 g of cscl was dissolved in 2000 ml of deionized water to prepare a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 of cs solution which could be diluted into different gradient concentrations and used for adsorption under different conditions the ph value of the cscl solution was adjusted using 0 1 mol l 1 hcl and naoh batch adsorption experiments were conducted in conical flasks containing a certain amount of adsorbent and cs solution put the conical flask into a constant temperature water bath with adjustable temperature and stir at a certain speed to ensure uniform dispersion within a certain time interval 1 ml of the solution sample was taken out and the concentrations of cs were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes prodigy xp icp teledyne leeman labs usa the properties of the adsorbent including adsorption capacity q adsorption rate e and distribution coefficient k d were calculated by the following equations 1 q e mg g 1 c 0 c e v m 2 e c 0 c e c 0 100 3 k d ml g 1 c 0 c e c e 1000 v m where c o and c e mg l 1 represent the initial and final concentrations of cs in the solution respectively v denotes the volumes of the cs solution m g is the dry weight of the amp pan beads 2 6 desorption and reusability multiple adsorption desorption cycle experiments were conducted to explore the adsorbent s desorption and cycling properties first a certain amount of amp pan n20 beads were put into a beaker containing 100 ml of 100 mg l 1 cs for adsorption and the adsorption time was 12 h then the 100 ml nh4cl solution was used to elute the cs containing amp pan n20 the adsorbent was then employed for the subsequent adsorption and desorption after being thoroughly cleaned with deionized water 2 7 fix bed adsorption to evaluate the dynamic adsorption performance of the adsorbent for cs a fixed bed adsorption study was conducted in this study amp pan n20 was packed into a vertical down flow glass column with a bed height h of either 2 cm or 8 cm to conduct the experiment the inner diameter of the glass column was 3 0 cm the flow rates q ml min 1 of the feed solution were 2 ml min 1 and 4 ml min 1 respectively controlled by a peristaltic pump bz600 chenao china using the coexistence of multiple ions containing cs geothermal water as the feed solution the ion composition of the geothermal water is shown in table 2 after adsorption the cs loaded adsorbent was eluted with 1 mol l 1 nh4cl as an eluent and the dynamic desorption performance of the adsorbent was investigated for ease of presentation the parameters of different fix bed adsorption are listed in table 3 different experiments are represented as g h q where g represents geothermal water h represents the bed height of the adsorbent and q represents the flow rate for instance g 2 4 represents the bed height is 2 cm with a flow rate of 4 ml min 1 the column capacity q c mg column adsorption efficiency r and mass transfer area mtz are calculated using formulas 4 5 and 6 4 q c q 1000 t 0 t t sat c ad dt 5 r q c c 0 v 6 mtz h 1 t bre t sat where q ml min 1 is the volume flow rate and c ad mg l 1 is the adsorbed cs concentration c 0 mg l 1 is the concentration of cs in the influent solution v l is the volume of the effluent and t bre and t sat are the adsorption breakthrough time and adsorption saturation time respectively when the cs concentration in the effluent reaches 0 5 mg l 1 was selected as the breakthrough time and the adsorption saturation time was chosen when the effluent concentration reached 99 of the initial cs concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization different porogenic agents resulted in different structures and adsorption performances of the adsorbent as shown in table 4 among different adsorbents amp pan n presented the smallest bead size diameter 1 mm and the best adsorption performance the decrease in amp pan n particle size is believed to be caused by hcl because amp pan n beads were the only ones formed in hcl solution on the other hand there is not much difference in bead size diameter 2 mm among amp pan amp pan c16 amp pan ctab and amp pan peg but their adsorption performance varied in this study several representative adsorbents were characterized by sem as shown in fig 2 all the beads have a yellow appearance and the particle size of amp pan n is smaller than that of amp pan the cross section of amp pan shows the highly canalicular pore structure of the internal compared with amp pan the cross section of amp pan n is more contracted and the internal pore structure is changed this phenomenon may be attributed to the following reasons firstly no porogenic agent was added in fig 2c the internal pores were formed by the leaching of dmso from the polymer solution secondly as nh4hco3 was added the nh4hco3 would also dissolve out from the inside of the microspheres to form pore channels mostly more obvious finger like pores moreover when the solidification bath was hcl nh4hco3 met hcl to generate gas and the gas would be released from the inside of the microspheres leaving pore channels in contrast most of these pore types were interpenetrating microporous structures leading to the change in the pore structure of amp pan n and after drying the microspheres showed a shrinkage phenomenon and the pore structure was further affected moreover the edx elemental mapping and spectrum of amp pan n20 is shown in figs 3 and 4 the elemental mapping fig 3 demonstrated the uniform distribution of the individual elements and the elemental peaks fig 4 of c n o p and mo also proved the formation of amp pan n fourier transform infrared ft ir was used to detect the functional groups in amp pan n as fig 5a shows the pan has two obvious absorption peaks at 2941 cm 1 and 2242 cm 1 which correspond to the stretching vibration of ch2 and cn respectively in amp there is an obvious absorption peak at 3213 cm 1 corresponding to the nh structure indicating the presence of nh4 in addition there is a broad absorption band near the wavenumber of 3435 cm 1 corresponding to the oh stretching vibration peak indicating the presence of crystal water in amp there are four smaller vibrational bands at 1064 964 866 and 788 cm 1 meaning that they correspond to the characteristic peaks of the pmo12o40 3 keggin structure in amp 25 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of pan amp and porous amp pan n showed that the characteristic bands of both pan and amp could be found in the ft ir spectra of amp pan n in which indicated that amp and pan were successfully compounded together besides no new absorption peaks were found implying that the two of amp and pan were physically combined and no chemical reaction occurred the xrd patterns of amp pan n fig 5b match that of pure amp well and the additional peak at 2θ 17 can be ascribed to that of the pure pan pattern no peaks are shifted and no additional peaks emerge in the pattern of amp pan n the tg curves of amp pan n in fig 5c exhibit higher thermal stability below 300 c than the powder adsorbent owing to the inhibition of the decomposition of amp after pan coating n2 adsorption desorption is one technique employed to assess the porosity of materials the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of amp pan and amp pan n are shown in fig 6a b all isotherms show a steep absorption at high relative pressures for instance the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and pore volume of amp pan were 11 2310 m2 g 1 and 0 038236 cm3 g 1 respectively in amp pan n these values markedly increased being 22 9417 m2 g 1 and 0 114531 cm3 g 1 moreover the pore size of amp pan and amp pan n increased from 14 6188 nm to 18 4970 nm the results show that when nh4hco3 was used as a porogenic agent the n2 desorption curve exhibited a hysteresis that indicated the number of passage pores of the microspheres increased the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the addition of nh4hco3 leads to a change in pore morphology thereby converting previously closed pores into either via pores or inter connected micropores and the specific surface area also increases these changes provide more exposed active adsorption sites for later adsorption 3 2 effects of different porogen on adsorption in this experiment four porogenic agents were used to synthesize different amp pan table 2 and the dosage of each different porogen was 0 4 g then these adsorbents were used for adsorption in 100 mg l 1 cs solution as shown in fig 7 amp pan without porogen reached equilibrium at about 24 h and the maximum adsorption capacity was 50 61 mg g 1 after using c16mim cl and ctab as porogen the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent did not increase and the adsorption equilibrium time did not shorten the adsorption capacity of amp pan peg was increased to 52 73 mg g 1 and the adsorption rate also increased the adsorption capacity of amp pan n was significantly higher than that of other adsorbents which is 55 05 mg g 1 and the adsorption equilibrium time is also shorter than other types of adsorbents which is about 8 h the reason is that amp pan n has a smaller particle size and better water permeability in the subsequent experiments the porogen peg 6000 and nh4hco3 were selected for continuing research amp pan with different dosages of porogen was prepared in different adsorbents the dosage of pan was kept at 2 g and the dosage of porogen was 0 2 g 0 4 g 1 0 g 1 6 g 2 0 g respectively the adsorbents are denoted as amp pan px and amp pan nx where x m porogen m pan 100 adsorbents with different ratios were prepared for adsorption and the adsorption effect is shown in fig 8 it was found that with the increase of peg 6000 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent did not increase significantly and the adsorption equilibrium time did not shorten instead the adsorption capacity of amp pan p50 and amp pan p80 decreased after reaching the maximum it is speculated that peg 6000 has good water solubility so the remaining peg in the adsorbent dissolves into water as time goes by which leads to the dissolution loss of amp in the adsorbent and the reduction of adsorption capacity with the increase of nh4hco3 addition the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent first increased and then decreased among them amp pan n20 has the largest adsorption capacity and the shortest adsorption equilibrium time therefore we used amp pan n20 as the adsorbent in the subsequent part of this study to conduct adsorption experiments 3 3 effects of solution ph on adsorption the adsorption was carried out with the solution ph ranging from 2 to 11 the result is shown in fig 9a amp pan n20 maintained good stability in all solutions and showed good adsorption performance the adsorption capacity gradually increases in ph 2 7 and progressively decreases after ph 7 this can be explained by the fact that during the adsorption process h can exchange ions with nh4 which affects the amount of nh4 exchanged with cs still the effect on the adsorption capacity is not significant because of the large difference between the radii of h and nh4 ions hence the adsorption capacity increases as the concentration of h ions in the solution decreases with the ph rise it was found that amp pan n20 had good adsorption performance in an acidic environment even when the ph 2 the adsorption capacity was not 50 mg g 1 but when the ph 11 the adsorption capacity dropped significantly indicating that the adsorbent is not suitable for operation in strong alkaline solutions this can be explained by the fact that alkali causes the decomposition of amp 24 7 nh 4 3 po 4 2 moo 3 3 h 2 o 27 naoh 3 nh 3 12 namoo 4 na 3 po 4 18 h o 2 3 4 effects of adsorbent dosage on adsorption the optimal solid liquid ratio must be determined in practical applications to use the adsorbent effectively therefore experiments with different adsorption liquid solid ratios were carried out and the optimal solid liquid ratio conditions were determined it can be seen from fig 9b that with the adsorbent dosage increased the adsorption capacity decreased but the adsorption efficiency increased when the dosage of the adsorbent was 3 g l 1 the adsorption efficiency reached 99 49 indicating that amp pan n20 has good removal performance for cs 3 5 adsorption kinetics to further investigate the nature of adsorption kinetics adsorption experiments at different contact times were carried out as illustrated in fig 10 the adsorption rate was fast in the initial stage of adsorption and slowed down with the increase of contact time and finally reached the adsorption equilibrium in 8 h which shorter than many other adsorbents 14 16 the widely used lagergren pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were further used to investigate the adsorption process s dynamic properties lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model 26 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q e and q t mg g 1 are adsorption capacities at a state of equilibrium and at time t min k 1 min 1 denotes the pseudo first orderate constant the values of q e and k 1 were calculated from the intercept and slope of the pseudo first order kinetic model in fig 10b lagergren pseudo second order kinetic model 27 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order constant the values of q e and k 2 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the pseudo second order kinetic model in fig 10b the results of the adsorption kinetic fitting are given in fig 10b and table 5 by comparing the correlation coefficients r 2 it could be determined that the experimental results were more fitted with the pseudo second order kinetic model in addition the maximum adsorption capacity 59 17 mg g 1 predicted by the pseudo second order kinetic model was nearer to the experimental results the better fitting of pseudo second order kinetics indicated that the adsorption rate was mainly controlled by the chemical adsorption mechanism 28 3 6 effects of cs initial concentration on adsorption and adsorption isotherms the investigation results into the connection between adsorption capacity and initial cs concentration are shown in fig 11a as the initial concentration of cs increases the adsorption capacity increases and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained in this study is 70 58 mg g 1 the equilibrium isotherms are of great significance for studying the mechanism of adsorption processes therefore the isotherms data were further analyzed using the freundlich and langmuir models the linear expression of the freundlich and langmuir model is shown as follows 29 30 10 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n 11 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where the logarithm of eq 10 is eq 11 k f and 1 n are the correlation constants concerning the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively 12 langmuir c e q e 1 bq max c e q max where c e represents the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 q e is the amount of cs adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 q max is the calculated isotherm adsorption capacity mg g 1 and b l mg 1 is a constant related to the affinity of the binding site the isotherm constants were obtained from the slope and intercept calculated in fig 11 and the calculated data are shown in table 6 as indicated in table 6 the correlation coefficients r 2 of the two models are relatively close still a higher r 2 demonstrates that the langmuir model fits more with the adsorption results than the freundlich model the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the langmuir model is 74 29 mg g 1 the results demonstrate that monolayer adsorption which mostly takes place on the surface of the adsorption site dominates the adsorption process in addition the value n obtained from the freundlich model is 5 4834 indicating the favorable adsorption process 3 7 effects of temperature on adsorption and adsorption thermodynamics in adsorption processes the temperature significantly affects the rate at which ions in solution diffuse into the sorbent thus experiments on the adsorption of cs by amp pan n20 at several temperatures were carried out in this work as indicated in fig 12a the adsorption capacity increased from 54 93 mg g 1 to 55 80 mg g 1 as the temperature increased from 298 15 to 328 15 k and the adsorption capacity increased slightly indicating that the temperature had little effect on the adsorption capacity hence this experiment selected room temperature as the adsorption temperature the adsorption thermodynamic was investigated to explore the adsorption process s properties further the basic thermodynamic parameters including the enthalpy δh 0 kj mol 1 entropy δs 0 j mol 1 k 1 and gibbs free energy δg 0 kj mol 1 of the adsorption were calculated by the following equations 13 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 r 1 t 14 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where k d is the equilibrium distribution coefficient t k is the thermodynamic temperature and r is the general gas constant with the value of 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 respectively the obtained value lnk d at different temperatures and the value 1 t was fitted and the plot was shown in fig 12b the value of δh 0 and δs 0 was calculated from the plot and the result are shown in table 7 the value of δh 0 is positive indicating that the adsorption process of amp pan n20 for cs is endothermic the value of δs 0 is positive indicating that the disorder of the system increases after adsorption in addition all the values of δg 0 are negative at temperatures from 293 15 to 323 15 k indicating that the adsorption process of amp pan n20 for cs was natural and spontaneous therefore no other energy input was required in the adsorption process 3 8 effects of competing ions on adsorption in this study na and k were selected as competing ions for cs adsorption because of the similarity of the chemical properties of these ions during the adsorption processes separate experiments were performed with different competing ions the concentration ranged from 0 to 400 mg l 1 while the concentration of cs was kept at 100 mg l 1 the results in fig 13 show that the adsorption capacity of amp pan n20 for cs decreased as the competing ions concentration increased however the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was still above 40 mg g 1 when the concentration of competing ions was high furthermore the distribution coefficient of cs in the solution also decreased as the concentration of competing ions increased the influence of k is obvious caused by the closer ionic radius to cs 31 3 9 desorption and the reusability of amp pan n20 the cs containing amp pan n20 was desorbed using nh4cl and the results are shown in fig 14a it could be found that the desorption efficiency increased with the increase of the concentration of nh4cl solution and the highest desorption efficiency of 57 34 was obtained but when the concentration of the desorption solution was higher than 1 mol l 1 the desorption efficiency did not increase obviously therefore 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl was selected as the eluent for the amp pan n20 cycle regeneration experiment the relationship between desorption efficiency and desorption time was also explored using 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl as an eluent and the results are shown in fig 14a it was discovered that the desorption efficiency increased over time and reached equilibrium in about 4 h the desorbed amp pan n20 was replaced in the cs solution for adsorption and ten adsorption regeneration experiments were performed the results in fig 14b show that the adsorption capacity of amp pan n20 did not decrease significantly as the number of regeneration increased and the adsorption capacity was consistently above 46 mg g 1 indicating that amp pan n20 has good recycling performance 3 10 application of amp pan n for cs removal 3 10 1 fixed bed adsorption for cs containing geothermal water to investigate the potential of amp pan n20 for industrial applications of cs adsorption we used natural cs containing geothermal water table 2 with abundant competing ions as the feedstock solution to study its effect on cs removal firstly the influence of different parameters such as flow rate and column height on the removal of cs ions was investigated fig 15a depicts the breakthrough curves for two different flow rates 2 ml min 1 and 4 ml min 1 with a column height of 2 cm and an initial cs concentration of 17 58 mg l 1 the effect of column height 2 cm and 8 cm at a constant initial cs concentration 17 58 mg l 1 and flow rates 2 ml min 1 are shown in fig 15b the parameters of the dynamic adsorption results are listed in table 8 at the same column height the adsorption saturation time decreased as the flow rate increased however when the flow rate was constant the adsorption saturation time increased with the increase in column height normally lower flow rates would result in slower diffusion of cs into the surface and inside the adsorbent the mass transfer driving force was reduced so the mass transfer zone mtz decreased with the flow rates overall lower inflow velocity and more significant column height lead to higher adsorption efficiency of cs in summary the maximum column adsorption capacity of 652 34 mg was obtained in q 2 ml min 1 and h 8 cm with the material adsorption capacity and single column adsorption efficiency of 27 13 mg g 1 and 66 56 the maximum adsorption saturation time was 490 h which showed the strong affinity of amp pan n20 for cs and its good long term adsorption performance in conclusion amp pan n20 demonstrated considerable potential for cs removal in industrial applications 3 10 2 dynamic model fitting of breakthrough curves the dynamic adsorption model can predict the breakthrough curve of the effluent and the adsorption performance of the adsorbent fig 16a c presents the breakthrough curves of cs adsorption by using amp pan n20 as the exchanger under three different conditions g 2 2 a g 2 4 b g 8 2 c this study analyzed the breakthrough curves of amp pan n20 for cs adsorption using the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models and their expressions are as follows 15 thomas c c 0 1 1 exp k th q m q o c 0 qt where k th l mg 1 h 1 is the thomas rate constant q 0 mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity m g is the amount of adsorbent used in the column and q l h 1 is the flow rate 16 adams bohart c c 0 exp k ab c 0 t k ab n 0 z u 0 where k ab is the kinetic constant l mg 1 h 1 n 0 is the saturation concentration mg l 1 z cm is the column height and u 0 is the superficial velocity which is defined as the ratio of flow rate q l h 1 to cross section area a cm2 17 yoon nelson c t c 0 exp k yn t τ k yn 1 exp k yn t τ k yn where k yn is the rate constant h 1 and τ h is the time required for 50 of the adsorbate to break through the nonlinear fitting of different models is shown in fig 13 and the fitting parameters of the models are shown in table 9 it could be found that the correlation coefficients of the thomas model were high r 2 0 9856 0 9940 which makes it well adapted to explain the adsorption process of amp pan n20 on cs within the fixed bed the thomas rate constant k th increased and the column adsorption capacity q 0 decreased with the flow rate increment the decrease in column adsorption capacity is probably due to the constant number of active sites whereas the increase in flow rate and thus the insufficient contact time between the adsorbate cs and the adsorbent the value of thomas rate constant k th increased with the flow rate while decreased with the rise in bed height analogously as the column height increased the adsorption capacity of the column q 0 increased while k th reduced the increment of q 0 is possibly caused by the enhancement of the mass driving force associated with the increased height the decrease of k th may be due to the flow resistance increase thus weakening the mass transfer effect the fit yielded q 0 values of 21 58 20 63 and 25 62 mg g 1 comparable to the experimentally obtained values 21 58 20 63 and 27 13 mg g 1 the value of k ab in the adams bohart model increased with the flow rate and decreased with the increase in bed height however the low r 2 values of the adams bohart model indicate that the model did not fit well with the dynamic adsorption and the breakthrough curves in fig 16 are not close to the predicted adams bohart model the value of k yn increased with the increasing flow rate and decreased with the rising bed height while the value of τ was the opposite the r 2 values of the yoon nelson model were almost the same as the thomas model in different experiments the value of τ is the time 50 of the cs required to break through in the effluent which was in good agreement with the value of the actual dynamic adsorption the actual dynamic adsorption values were 66 78 31 81 and 292 69 h respectively 3 10 3 dynamic desorption after the adsorption experiment g 8 2 the 1 mol l 1 nh4cl was used to elute the cs containing amp pan n20 through column operation with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the result is shown in fig 16d it could be found that the concentration of cs in the effluent decreased with the increase of time and reached the desorption equilibrium in about 14 h the concentration of cs in the total effluent was measured and the desorption efficiency was calculated to be 55 3 11 stability of the adsorbent the stability of amp pan n20 was further explored and shown in fig s1 after being immersed in geothermal water for 30 days the color of amp pan n20 beads changed to light green however they still maintained an excellent spherical shape which showed the good stability of the adsorbent the ft ir spectra of amp pan n20 before and after the adsorption were detected fig s2 and there was no noticeable chemical bond change after adsorption edx analysis showed that the cesium signal was seen on the surface of the amp pan n20 after adsorption fig s2 and a certain amount of cs appeared table s1 edx elemental mapping shows that the adsorbed cs were evenly distributed on the surface of amp pan n20 fig s3 3 12 comparison of amp pan n20 to other adsorbents the developed adsorbent was further evaluated by comparing it with other reported composites and the results are shown in table 10 clearly amp pan n20 was superior in reaction kinetics the adsorption capacity toward cs also reached a relatively high level it is also noteworthy that compared with amp sba 15 20 and amp al mcm 41 33 amp pan n20 has the advantages of easy synthesis environmental friendliness and continuous operation by contrast amp pan n20 exhibits good adsorption capacity fast adsorption kinetics and stable recovery performance enabling its potential application in cs removal and enrichment 4 conclusions in this work we synthesized several different kinds of adsorbents by adding different porogens during amp pan synthesis and determined amp pan n20 as the adsorbent with the best adsorption effect compared with the traditional amp pan amp pan n20 beads have a smaller particle size a larger adsorption capacity and a shorter adsorption equilibrium time the adsorbent could effectively adsorb cs under a wide ph range and high concentration of competing ions using nh4cl as the eluent can realize the recovery of cs and the reuse of the adsorbent the adsorbent can be reused at least 10 times moreover the column adsorption test showed that the amp pan n20 had a long breakthrough time the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models are used to predict the breakthrough carve and the results showed that the thomas and yoon nelson models could describe the breakthrough carves well in addition the amp pan n20 maintained good stability after a long time of adsorption in geothermal water therefore the improved amp pan n20 in this study shows its potential

12619,a novel porogen added ammonium phosphomolybdate polyacrylonitrile amp pan n20 was prepared to remove cs from geothermal water compared with traditional amp pan porous amp pan n20 beads have a smaller particle size larger adsorption capacity and faster adsorption rate the adsorption batch experiments were carried out with the research objects adsorbent contact time dosage ph value initial

maintained good stability after a long time of adsorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorbent ion exchange amp pan composite porogenic agent cs removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the remediation of radioactive wastewater has attracted widespread attention from research institutions and governments worldwide especially after the fukushima nuclear power plant accident in japan which resulted in the uncontrolled release of fission products into the environment among many fission products 137cs is one of the most hazardous radioisotopes because of its gamma ray emission long half life 30 2 years and good water solubility 1 2 furthermore the accumulation of 137cs in organisms can cause dna damage 3 albinism and tumors 4 however 137cs can also be used as a gamma radiation source for sterilization and cancer radiotherapy therefore developing effective technologies to remove and extract 137cs from nuclear wastewater is essential for the sustainable development of nuclear power nowadays various methods have been extensively studied to remove radioactive from aqueous solutions including precipitation 5 solvent extraction 6 electrochemical 7 and adsorption among them adsorption has demonstrated good efficiency in removing cesium and easy operation so extensive research has been conducted on various adsorbents examples of these are polymer resins 8 9 natural zeolites 10 titanosilicates 11 prussian blue p b analogues 12 13 and ammonium molybdophosphate amp 14 16 among the previously developed adsorbents amp nh4 3p mo3o10 4 3h2o have demonstrated their good selectivity high adsorption capacity 17 and reusability so it has been extensively studied previous investigations indicated that the pmo12o40 3 in amp is a cage like structure and both cs and nh4 can be adsorbed at oxygen atoms on the surface of pmo12o40 3 this result allows nh4 to exchange with adsorbed cs without destroying the crystalline structure 18 therefore the adsorbed cs can be eluted with ammonium salt solution for cs recovery and adsorbent reuse which is very important for industrial applications however the microcrystalline structure of amp makes it challenging to recover after adsorption which limits its application in industrial aqueous solutions therefore many researchers have studied materials used to immobilize amp such as alumina 19 mesoporous silica 20 sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 16 and 21 while significant progress has been achieved most suffer from the following problems inferior acid or alkali tolerance relatively low adsorption performance complex synthesis steps which involve high temperature operation polyacrylonitrile pan with series of advantages like excellent molding ability solvent resistance outstanding thermo mechanical stability and strong tensile properties making it an appropriate polymer matrix for amp at present ammonium molybdophosphate polyacrylonitrile amp pan has been studied by many researchers due to its good adsorption efficiency park et al 22 investigated the removal of co2 sr2 and cs from radioactive laundry wastewater by amp pan and it consistently maintained high selectivity for cs in the presence of surfactants todd et al 23 demonstrated that the amp pan composite adsorbent possesses a superior ability to remove cesium from concentrated acid tank waste streams although amp pan has been proven to have effective adsorption performance in acidic and high salt radioactive wastewater its slow adsorption rate and low adsorption capacity restrict its further application and promotion hence several porogenic agents were screened in this work and their dosages were investigated for the first time to address these problems the results showed that the pore forming amp pan microspheres exhibited faster reaction kinetics and higher adsorption capacity fixed bed adsorption experiments are considered the vane of industrial application which can provide theoretical and technical support for practical production life and early warning of process operation conditions 24 breakthrough curve configuration and breakthrough times are two important indicators of continuous adsorption kinetics in fixed beds not much data has been reported on the penetration curve s dependence on these parameters e g bed height flow rate for the adsorption of cs on amp pan therefore in this work non radioactive geothermal water cs 17 58 mg l 1 was selected as the simulated wastewater to test the adsorption performance of the adsorbent under dynamic conditions finally the best process parameters were obtained which provides some theoretical support for future industrialization in this study we prepared several adsorbents by adding different porogenic agents to synthesize amp pan we determined the appropriate porogen by comparing the adsorption efficiency of other adsorbents after characterizing the physicochemical properties the optimized screening adsorbents were used to adsorb cs from geothermal water the adsorption isotherm thermodynamics and kinetics of the adsorption process and the adsorption mechanism were explored the effect of different concentrations of desorption agents on desorption was also investigated and the adsorbent was used for multiple cycles of regeneration adsorption to test the cycle stability and durability of the adsorbent moreover the newly synthesized amp pan was used in the dynamic adsorption of cs containing geothermal water to study its performance on cs removal in natural water 2 experimental 2 1 experiment materials ammonium phosphomolybdate amp nh4 3pmo12o40 3h2o 99 was obtained from the aladdin biochemical technology co polyacrylonitrile pan powder 98 and dimethyl sulfoxide

chloride ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride was obtained from sigma aldrich inc 2 2 synthesis of amp pan beads the synthesis process of amp pan beads is shown in fig 1 first 0 2 g of tween 80 and 5 g of amp were added to 25 ml of dmso after stirring at 250 r min 1 and 50 c for 0 5 h 2 g of pan was added to the solution and then the mixture was stirred at 50 c and 500 r min 1 for 6 h a homogeneous yellow gel was finally obtained next the mixture was added dropwise into deionized water with a syringe to get beads in addition in order to strengthen the stability of the beads stirring was required for 4 h finally the obtained amp pan beads were washed with deionized water and then dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h 2 3 preparation of porous amp pan the effect of different porogenic agents on cs adsorption was investigated three porogenic agents c16mim cl and ctab as ionic liquid porogen peg 6000 as water soluble polymer porogen and nh4hco3 as gas producing porogen were used the names and properties of different porogenic agents are summarized in table 1 the porous amp pan was prepared by the same method except that a certain amount of porogen was added to the dmso during synthesis nh4hco3 porogen amp pan mixture was dropped into the 0 1 mol l 1 hcl solution to generate co2 air bubbles in the beads and other types of amp pan were still dropped into the water to form beads 2 4 characterization the surface morphology of amp pan beads was evaluated using surface scanning electron microscope image analysis sem jsm it300lv japan ft ir spectra were analyzed in the 4000

spectrometer edx ea1000vx japan instruments the porous surface properties of the adsorbent were determined by the surface porosity analyzer micromeritics asap 2020m usa n2 adsorption desorption was performed at 77 k for 5 h and the surface area was assessed using brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 5 batch adsorption 2 534 g of cscl was dissolved in 2000 ml of deionized water to prepare a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 of cs solution which could be diluted into different gradient concentrations and used for adsorption under different conditions the ph value of the cscl solution was adjusted using 0 1 mol l 1 hcl and naoh batch adsorption experiments were conducted in conical flasks containing a certain amount of adsorbent and cs solution put the conical flask into a constant temperature water bath with adjustable temperature and stir at a certain speed to ensure uniform dispersion within a certain time interval 1 ml of the solution sample was taken out and the concentrations of cs were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes prodigy xp icp teledyne leeman labs usa the properties of the adsorbent including adsorption

reusability multiple adsorption desorption cycle experiments were conducted to explore the adsorbent s desorption and cycling properties first a certain amount of amp pan n20 beads were put into a beaker containing 100 ml of 100 mg l 1 cs for adsorption and the adsorption time was 12 h then the 100 ml nh4cl solution was used to elute the cs containing amp pan n20 the adsorbent was then employed for the subsequent adsorption and desorption after being thoroughly cleaned with deionized water 2 7 fix bed adsorption to evaluate the dynamic adsorption performance of the adsorbent for cs a fixed bed adsorption study was conducted in this study amp pan n20 was packed into a vertical down flow glass column with a bed height h of either 2 cm or 8 cm to conduct the experiment the inner diameter of the glass column was 3 0 cm the flow rates q ml min 1 of the feed solution were 2 ml min 1 and 4 ml min 1 respectively controlled by a peristaltic pump bz600 chenao china using the coexistence of multiple ions containing cs geothermal water as the feed solution the ion composition of the geothermal water is shown in table 2 after adsorption the cs loaded adsorbent was eluted with 1 mol l 1

of the effluent and t bre and t sat are the adsorption breakthrough time and adsorption saturation time respectively when the cs concentration in the effluent reaches 0 5 mg l 1 was selected as the breakthrough time and the adsorption saturation time was chosen when the effluent concentration reached 99 of the initial cs concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization different porogenic agents resulted in different structures and adsorption performances of the adsorbent as shown in table 4 among different adsorbents amp pan n presented the smallest bead size diameter 1 mm and the best adsorption performance the decrease in amp pan n particle size is believed to be caused by hcl because amp pan n beads were the only ones formed in hcl solution on the other hand there is not much difference in bead size diameter 2 mm among amp pan amp pan c16 amp pan ctab and amp pan peg but their adsorption performance varied in this study several representative adsorbents were characterized by sem as shown in fig 2 all the beads have a yellow appearance and the particle size of amp pan n is smaller than that of amp pan the cross section of amp pan shows the highly canalicular pore structure of the internal compared with amp pan the cross section of amp pan n is more contracted and the internal pore structure is changed this phenomenon may be attributed to the following reasons firstly no porogenic agent was added in fig 2c the internal pores were formed by the leaching of dmso from the polymer solution secondly as nh4hco3 was added the nh4hco3 would also dissolve out from the inside of the microspheres to form pore channels mostly more obvious finger like pores moreover when the solidification bath was hcl nh4hco3 met hcl to generate gas and the gas would be released from the inside of the microspheres leaving pore channels in contrast most of these pore types were interpenetrating microporous structures leading to the change in the pore structure of amp pan n and after drying the microspheres showed a shrinkage phenomenon and the pore structure was further affected moreover the edx elemental mapping and spectrum of amp pan n20 is shown in figs 3 and 4 the elemental mapping fig 3 demonstrated the uniform distribution of the individual elements and the elemental peaks fig 4 of c n o p and mo also proved the formation of amp pan n fourier transform infrared ft ir was used to detect the functional groups in amp pan n as fig 5a shows the pan has two obvious absorption peaks at 2941 cm 1 and 2242 cm 1 which correspond to the stretching vibration of ch2 and cn respectively in amp there is an obvious absorption peak at 3213 cm 1 corresponding to the nh structure indicating the presence of nh4 in addition there is a broad absorption band near the wavenumber of 3435 cm 1 corresponding to the oh stretching vibration peak indicating the presence of crystal water in amp there are four smaller vibrational bands at 1064 964 866 and 788 cm 1 meaning that they correspond to the characteristic peaks of the pmo12o40 3 keggin structure in amp 25 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of pan amp and porous amp pan n showed that the characteristic bands of both pan and amp could be found in the ft ir spectra of amp pan n in which indicated that amp and pan were successfully compounded together besides no new absorption peaks were found implying that the two of amp and pan were physically combined and no chemical reaction occurred the xrd patterns of amp pan n fig 5b match that of pure amp well and the additional peak at 2θ 17 can be ascribed to that of the pure pan pattern no peaks are shifted and no additional peaks emerge in the pattern of amp pan n the tg curves of amp pan n in fig 5c exhibit higher thermal stability below 300 c than the powder adsorbent owing to the inhibition of the decomposition of amp after pan coating n2 adsorption desorption is one technique employed to assess the porosity of materials the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of amp pan and amp pan n are shown in fig 6a b all isotherms show a steep absorption at high relative pressures for instance the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and pore volume of amp pan were 11 2310 m2 g 1 and 0 038236 cm3 g 1 respectively in amp pan n these values markedly increased being 22 9417 m2 g 1 and 0 114531 cm3 g 1 moreover the pore size of amp pan and amp pan n increased from 14 6188 nm to 18 4970 nm the results show that when nh4hco3 was used as a porogenic agent the n2 desorption curve exhibited a hysteresis that indicated the number of passage pores of the microspheres increased the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the addition of nh4hco3 leads to a change in pore morphology thereby converting previously closed pores into either via pores or inter connected micropores and the specific surface area also increases these changes provide more exposed active adsorption sites for later adsorption 3 2 effects of different porogen on adsorption in this experiment four porogenic agents were used to synthesize different amp pan table 2 and the dosage of each different porogen was 0 4 g then these adsorbents were used for adsorption in 100 mg l 1 cs solution as shown in fig 7 amp pan without porogen reached equilibrium at about 24 h and the maximum adsorption capacity was 50 61 mg g 1 after using c16mim cl and ctab as porogen the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent did not increase and the adsorption equilibrium time did not shorten the adsorption capacity of amp pan peg was increased to 52 73 mg g 1 and the adsorption rate also increased the adsorption capacity of amp pan n was significantly higher than that of other adsorbents which is 55 05 mg g 1 and the adsorption equilibrium time is also shorter than other types of adsorbents which is about 8 h the reason is that amp pan n has a smaller particle size and better water permeability in the subsequent experiments the porogen peg 6000 and nh4hco3 were selected for continuing research amp pan with different dosages of porogen was prepared in different adsorbents the dosage of pan was kept at 2 g and the dosage of porogen was 0 2 g 0 4 g 1 0 g 1 6 g 2 0 g respectively the adsorbents are denoted as amp pan px and amp pan nx where x m porogen m pan 100 adsorbents with different ratios were prepared for adsorption and the adsorption effect is shown in fig 8 it was found that with the increase of peg 6000 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent did not increase significantly and the adsorption equilibrium time did not shorten instead the adsorption capacity of amp pan p50 and amp pan p80 decreased after reaching the maximum it is speculated that peg 6000 has good water solubility so the remaining peg in the adsorbent dissolves into water as time goes by which leads to the dissolution loss of amp in the adsorbent and the reduction of adsorption capacity with the increase of nh4hco3 addition the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent first increased and then decreased among them amp pan n20 has the largest adsorption capacity and the shortest adsorption equilibrium time therefore we used amp pan n20 as the adsorbent in the subsequent part of this study to conduct adsorption experiments 3 3 effects of solution ph on adsorption the adsorption was carried out with the solution ph ranging from 2 to 11 the result is shown in fig 9a amp pan n20 maintained good stability in all solutions and showed good adsorption performance the adsorption capacity gradually increases in ph 2 7 and progressively decreases after ph 7 this can be explained by the fact that during the adsorption process h can exchange ions with nh4 which affects the amount of nh4 exchanged with cs still the effect on the adsorption capacity is not significant because of the large difference between the radii of h and nh4 ions hence the adsorption capacity increases as the concentration of h ions in the solution decreases with the ph rise it was found that amp pan n20 had good adsorption performance in an acidic environment even when the ph 2 the adsorption capacity was not 50 mg g 1 but when the ph 11 the adsorption capacity dropped significantly indicating that the adsorbent is not suitable for operation in strong alkaline solutions this can be explained by the fact that alkali causes the decomposition of amp 24 7 nh 4 3 po 4 2 moo 3 3 h 2 o 27 naoh 3 nh 3 12 namoo 4 na 3 po 4 18 h o 2 3 4 effects of adsorbent dosage on adsorption the optimal solid liquid ratio must be determined in practical applications to use the adsorbent effectively therefore experiments with different adsorption liquid solid ratios were carried out and the optimal solid liquid ratio conditions were determined it can be seen from fig 9b that with the adsorbent dosage increased the adsorption capacity decreased but the adsorption efficiency increased when the dosage of the adsorbent was 3 g l 1 the adsorption efficiency reached 99 49 indicating that amp pan n20 has good removal performance for cs 3 5 adsorption kinetics to further investigate the nature of adsorption kinetics adsorption experiments at different contact times were carried out as illustrated in fig 10 the adsorption rate was fast in the initial stage of adsorption and slowed down with the increase of contact time and finally reached the adsorption equilibrium in 8 h which shorter than many other adsorbents 14 16 the widely used lagergren pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were further used to investigate the adsorption process s dynamic properties lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model 26 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q e and q t mg g 1 are adsorption capacities at a state of equilibrium and at time t min k 1 min 1 denotes the pseudo first orderate constant the values of q e and k 1 were calculated from the intercept and slope of the pseudo first order kinetic model in fig 10b lagergren pseudo second order kinetic model 27 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order constant the values of q e and k 2 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the pseudo second order kinetic model in fig 10b the results of the adsorption kinetic fitting are given in fig 10b and table 5 by comparing the correlation coefficients r 2 it could be determined that the experimental results were more fitted with the pseudo second order kinetic model in addition the maximum adsorption capacity 59 17 mg g 1 predicted by the pseudo second order kinetic model was nearer to the experimental results the better fitting of pseudo second order kinetics indicated that the adsorption rate was mainly controlled by the chemical adsorption mechanism 28 3 6 effects of cs initial concentration on adsorption and adsorption isotherms the investigation results into the connection between adsorption capacity and initial cs concentration are shown in fig 11a as the initial concentration of cs increases the adsorption capacity increases and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained in this study is 70 58 mg g 1 the equilibrium isotherms are of great significance for studying the mechanism of adsorption processes therefore the isotherms data were further analyzed using the freundlich and langmuir models the linear expression of the freundlich and langmuir model is shown as follows 29 30 10 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n 11 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where the logarithm of eq 10 is eq 11 k f and 1 n are the correlation constants concerning the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively 12 langmuir c e q e 1 bq max c e q max where c e represents the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 q e is the amount of cs adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 q max is the calculated isotherm adsorption capacity mg g 1 and b l mg 1 is a constant related to the affinity of the binding site the isotherm constants were obtained from the slope and intercept calculated in fig 11 and the calculated data are shown in table 6 as indicated in table 6 the correlation coefficients r 2 of the two models are relatively close still a higher r 2 demonstrates that the langmuir model fits more with the adsorption results than the freundlich model the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the langmuir model is 74 29 mg g 1 the results demonstrate that monolayer adsorption which mostly takes place on the surface of the adsorption site dominates the adsorption process in addition the value n obtained from the freundlich model is 5 4834 indicating the favorable adsorption process 3 7 effects of temperature on adsorption and adsorption thermodynamics in adsorption processes the temperature significantly affects the rate at which ions in solution diffuse into the sorbent thus experiments on the adsorption of cs by amp pan n20 at several temperatures were carried out in this work as indicated in fig 12a the adsorption capacity increased from 54 93 mg g 1 to 55 80 mg g 1 as the temperature increased from 298 15 to 328 15 k and the adsorption capacity increased slightly indicating that the temperature had little effect on the adsorption capacity hence this experiment selected room temperature as the adsorption temperature the adsorption thermodynamic was investigated to explore the adsorption process s properties further the basic thermodynamic parameters including the enthalpy δh 0 kj mol 1 entropy δs 0 j mol 1 k 1 and gibbs free energy δg 0 kj mol 1 of the adsorption were calculated by the following equations 13 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 r 1 t 14 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where k d is the equilibrium distribution coefficient t k is the thermodynamic temperature and r is the general gas constant with the value of 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 respectively the obtained value lnk d at different temperatures and the value 1 t was fitted and the plot was shown in fig 12b the value of δh 0 and δs 0 was calculated from the plot and the result are shown in table 7 the value of δh 0 is positive indicating that the adsorption process of amp pan n20 for cs is endothermic the value of δs 0 is positive indicating that the disorder of the system increases after adsorption in addition all the values of δg 0 are negative at temperatures from 293 15 to 323 15 k indicating that the adsorption process of amp pan n20 for cs was natural and spontaneous therefore no other energy input was required in the adsorption process 3 8 effects of competing ions on adsorption in this study na and k were selected as competing ions for cs adsorption because of the similarity of the chemical properties of these ions during the adsorption processes separate experiments were performed with different competing ions the concentration ranged from 0 to 400 mg l 1 while the concentration of cs was kept at 100 mg l 1 the results in fig 13 show that the adsorption capacity of amp pan n20 for cs decreased as the competing ions concentration increased however the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was still above 40 mg g 1 when the concentration of competing ions was high furthermore the distribution coefficient of cs in the solution also decreased as the concentration of competing ions increased the influence of k is obvious caused by the closer ionic radius to cs 31 3 9 desorption and the reusability of amp pan n20 the cs containing amp pan n20 was desorbed using nh4cl and the results are shown in fig 14a it could be found that the desorption efficiency increased with the increase of the concentration of nh4cl solution and the highest desorption efficiency of 57 34 was obtained but when the concentration of the desorption solution was higher than 1 mol l 1 the desorption efficiency did not increase obviously therefore 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl was selected as the eluent for the amp pan n20 cycle regeneration experiment the relationship between desorption efficiency and desorption time was also explored using 1 mol l 1 of nh4cl as an eluent and the results are shown in fig 14a it was discovered that the desorption efficiency increased over time and reached equilibrium in about 4 h the desorbed amp pan n20 was replaced in the cs solution for adsorption and ten adsorption regeneration experiments were performed the results in fig 14b show that the adsorption capacity of amp pan n20 did not decrease significantly as the number of regeneration increased and the adsorption capacity was consistently above 46 mg g 1 indicating that amp pan n20 has good recycling performance 3 10 application of amp pan n for cs removal 3 10 1 fixed bed adsorption for cs containing geothermal water to investigate the potential of amp pan n20 for industrial applications of cs adsorption we used natural cs containing geothermal water table 2 with abundant competing ions as the feedstock solution to study its effect on cs removal firstly the influence of different parameters such as flow rate and column height on the removal of cs ions was investigated fig 15a depicts the breakthrough curves for two different flow rates 2 ml min 1 and 4 ml min 1 with a column height of 2 cm and an initial cs concentration of 17 58 mg l 1 the effect of column height 2 cm and 8 cm at a constant initial cs concentration 17 58 mg l 1 and flow rates 2 ml min 1 are shown in fig 15b the parameters of the dynamic adsorption results are listed in table 8 at the same column height the adsorption saturation time decreased as the flow rate increased however when the flow rate was constant the adsorption saturation time increased with the increase in column height normally lower flow rates would result in slower diffusion of cs into the surface and inside the adsorbent the mass transfer driving force was reduced so the mass transfer zone mtz decreased with the flow rates overall lower inflow velocity and more significant column height lead to higher adsorption efficiency of cs in summary the maximum column adsorption capacity of 652 34 mg was obtained in q 2 ml min 1 and h 8 cm with the material adsorption capacity and single column adsorption efficiency of 27 13 mg g 1 and 66 56 the maximum adsorption saturation time was 490 h which showed the strong affinity of amp pan n20 for cs and its good long term adsorption performance in conclusion amp pan n20 demonstrated considerable potential for cs removal in industrial applications 3 10 2 dynamic model fitting of breakthrough curves the dynamic adsorption model can predict the breakthrough curve of the effluent and the adsorption performance of the adsorbent fig 16a c presents the breakthrough curves of cs adsorption by using amp pan n20 as the exchanger under three different conditions g 2 2 a g 2 4 b g 8 2 c this study analyzed the breakthrough curves of amp pan n20 for cs adsorption using the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models and their expressions are as follows 15 thomas c c 0 1 1 exp k th q m q o c 0 qt where k th l mg 1 h 1 is the thomas rate constant q 0 mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity m g is the amount of adsorbent used in the column and q l h 1 is the flow rate 16 adams bohart c c 0 exp k ab c 0 t k ab n 0 z u 0 where k ab is the kinetic constant l mg 1 h 1 n 0 is the saturation concentration mg l 1 z cm is the column height and u 0 is the superficial velocity which is defined as the ratio of flow rate q l h 1 to cross section area a cm2 17 yoon nelson c t c 0 exp k yn t τ k yn 1 exp k yn t τ k yn where k yn is the rate constant h 1 and τ h is the time required for 50 of the adsorbate to break through the nonlinear fitting of different models is shown in fig 13 and the fitting parameters of the models are shown in table 9 it could be found that the correlation coefficients of the thomas model were high r 2 0 9856 0 9940 which makes it well adapted to explain the adsorption process of amp pan n20 on cs within the fixed bed the thomas rate constant k th increased and the column adsorption capacity q 0 decreased with the flow rate increment the decrease in column adsorption capacity is probably due to the constant number of active sites whereas the increase in flow rate and thus the insufficient contact time between the adsorbate cs and the adsorbent the value of thomas rate constant k th increased with the flow rate while decreased with the rise in bed height analogously as the column height increased the adsorption capacity of the column q 0 increased while k th reduced the increment of q 0 is possibly caused by the enhancement of the mass driving force associated with the increased height the decrease of k th may be due to the flow resistance increase thus weakening the mass transfer effect the fit yielded q 0 values of 21 58 20 63 and 25 62 mg g 1 comparable to the experimentally obtained values 21 58 20 63 and 27 13 mg g 1 the value of k ab in the adams bohart model increased with the flow rate and decreased with the increase in bed height however the low r 2 values of the adams bohart model indicate that the model did not fit well with the dynamic adsorption and the breakthrough curves in fig 16 are not close to the predicted adams bohart model the value of k yn increased with the increasing flow rate and decreased with the rising bed height while the value of τ was the opposite the r 2 values of the yoon nelson model were almost the same as the thomas model in different experiments the value of τ is the time 50 of the cs required to break through in the effluent which was in good agreement with the value of the actual dynamic adsorption the actual dynamic adsorption values were 66 78 31 81 and 292 69 h respectively 3 10 3 dynamic desorption after the adsorption experiment g 8 2 the 1 mol l 1 nh4cl was used to elute the cs containing amp pan n20 through column operation with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the result is shown in fig 16d it could be found that the concentration of cs in the effluent decreased with the increase of time and reached the desorption equilibrium in about 14 h the concentration of cs in the total effluent was measured and the desorption efficiency was calculated to be 55 3 11 stability of the adsorbent the stability of amp pan n20 was further explored and shown in fig s1 after being immersed in geothermal water for 30 days the color of amp pan n20 beads changed to light green however they still maintained an excellent spherical shape which showed the good stability of the adsorbent the ft ir spectra of amp pan n20 before and after the adsorption were detected fig s2 and there was no noticeable chemical bond change after adsorption edx analysis showed that the cesium signal was seen on the surface of the amp pan n20 after adsorption fig s2 and a certain amount of cs appeared table s1 edx elemental mapping shows that the adsorbed cs were evenly distributed on the surface of amp pan n20 fig s3 3 12 comparison of amp pan n20 to other adsorbents the developed adsorbent was further evaluated by comparing it with other reported composites and the results are shown in table 10 clearly amp pan n20 was superior in reaction kinetics the adsorption capacity toward cs also reached a relatively high level it is also noteworthy that compared with amp sba 15 20 and amp al mcm 41 33 amp pan n20 has the advantages of easy synthesis environmental friendliness and continuous operation by contrast amp pan n20 exhibits good adsorption capacity fast adsorption kinetics and stable recovery performance enabling its potential application in cs removal and enrichment 4 conclusions in this work we synthesized several different kinds of adsorbents by adding different porogens during amp pan synthesis and determined amp pan n20 as the adsorbent with the best adsorption effect compared with the traditional amp pan amp pan n20 beads have a smaller particle size a larger adsorption capacity and a shorter adsorption equilibrium time the adsorbent could effectively adsorb cs under a wide ph range and high concentration of competing ions using nh4cl as the eluent can realize the recovery of cs and the reuse of the adsorbent the adsorbent can be reused at least 10 times moreover the column adsorption test showed that the amp pan n20 had a long breakthrough time the thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson models are used to predict the breakthrough carve and the results showed that the thomas and yoon nelson models could describe the breakthrough carves well in addition the amp pan n20 maintained good stability after a long time of adsorption in geothermal water therefore the improved amp pan n20 in this study shows its potential
