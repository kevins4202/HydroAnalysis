10495,grapevine is a widespread crop for grape and wine production often cultivated on hilly areas moderate vine water stress plays an important role in determining high quality viticulture however a precise quantification of the effect of hydraulic properties and slope gradient on hilly soil water balance and consequently on vine stress has not yet been addressed in the literature the slope gradient effect is generally taken for granted without providing experiments validating such a qualitative assumption we tested the hypothesis that soil hydraulic properties play a greater role than slope gradient in driving soil water status and vine stress in two consecutive years we studied an aglianico vineyard grown along a 90 m slope with up slope soil having lower water holding capacity than down slope up slope vines were more stressed as shown by lower leaf water potential stomatal conductance leaf co2 assimilation and leaf area index than down slope vines water flow was simulated by using the hydrus 2d 3d model calibrated and validated towards a two year set of soil water content measurements significantly lower soil pressure head and higher transpiration occurred in the up than the down slope site a viable procedure was developed to separate the effects of soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient by modelling soil water balance and therefore vine transpiration with and without the slope gradient the simulations indicated that the difference in seasonal relative transpiration of 8 in 2011 and 5 in 2012 between the two sites was due to their differing soil hydraulic properties and that the slope gradient had no contribution to this variation keywords vineyard hydraulic properties vine water stress hydrus 2d 3d modelling 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera l is a species well adapted to mild winters and hot summers with limited precipitation during most of the growing season williams et al 1994 as in the mediterranean area in this environment it is very important to address vine water stress as grape and wine quality can be improved by moderate water stress during specific phenological stages ojeda et al 2002 van leeuwen et al 2009 medrano et al 2003 in a 10 year experiment indicated that soil water availability affected vine water status inhibiting leaf photosynthesis with a negative effect on yield drought can give rise to vine water stress especially when vineyards are grown in soils with limited water holding capacity brillante et al 2017 tramontini et al 2013 poni et al 2018 pointed out that texture and structure of soil as they affect the soil hydraulic properties influence the water holding capacity and therefore the proneness of vines to water stress while chemical properties play only a minor role it is well known that high quality viticulture in the mediterranean region is commonly located in hilly areas prosdocimi et al 2016 slope gradient aspect radiation surface runoff soil water flow and soil hydraulic properties all related to the geomorphological setting are considered of primary importance for stress related vineyard performance under real field conditions even if each of the abovementioned factors could be measured the effect on water balance and vine response of every single factor is hard to quantify therefore in the literature they are generally mixed up biddoccu et al 2017 hofmann and schultz 2015 peyrard et al 2016 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 and a precise quantification of the effect of each factor has not been yet addressed this lack of knowledge is unfortunate in fact understanding the impact of the above slope related factors on grape quality is fundamental to improve management of hilly viticulture and even more importantly to support the climate change adaptation of mediterranean viticulture bonfante et al 2017 in this paper we focus on the effects of slope gradient and soil hydraulic properties on water balance and vine response the evidence about the importance of both slope gradient and slope position on soil properties dates back to the 1930s milne 1936 demonstrated the sequential change of soils along hill slopes due to erosional and depositional processes and most importantly the variation in subsurface drainage lateral transport of sediments and translocation of materials at or beneath the soil surface catena concept this concept has been widely demonstrated over the years in the specific case of viticulture it has been demonstrated that soil hydrological properties can markedly change along a slope bonfante et al 2015 casanova et al 2000 famiglietti et al 1998 and that up slope vines are more prone to stress as soils there commonly have lower water holding capacity than down slope soils papers in the literature have focused on the slope effects on soil hydraulic conductivity bodner et al 2008 and soil moisture distribution e g battany and grismer 2000 some authors have reported that up slope soils can potentially be subjected to water flow with consequent accumulation of water downwards of the slope biddoccu et al 2017 brillante et al 2017 however western and grayson 2000 observed that the distribution of moisture in hillslope soils is strongly influenced by the slope gradient during the wet periods while during the dry periods there is little topographic influence this result was confirmed by nasta et al 2013 in southern italian landscapes dominated by pasture orchards and grassland however there is lack of knowledge and methodologies to discriminate or quantify the role played by the soil hydraulic properties resulting from the effect of slope gradient in producing differences in soil water content and therefore in vine stress most importantly the role of the slope gradient in producing different water stress and consequently different vineyard responses is generally taken for granted without providing real or numerical experiments to validate such a qualitative assumption it is especially important to build up a robust and viable process based numerical procedure for understanding the impact of soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient on soil and vine water status in pursuance of this aim we tested the hypothesis that soil hydrological properties could play the predominant role as compared to slope gradient in producing differences in soil water status and vine stress between up and down slope sites this hypothesis was tested with the hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 extensively used to simulate movement of water in the soil plant atmosphere system this model has been widely applied for different crops such as almond phogat et al 2012 maize scognamiglio et al 2019 eggplant ghazouani et al 2016 citrus phogat et al 2014 olive orchards autovino et al 2018 and wine grapes phogat et al 2017 thus the hydrus 2d 3d model was applied in a field experiment carried out over two consecutive years at a vineyard in a hilly area where both up slope and down slope soil water status and vine physiological responses were monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site the experiment was performed in a 2 3 ha farm oriented to high quality wine production named quintodecimo located in a marl sandstone carbonate hilly environment of southern italy mirabella eclano av campania region lat 41 047808 lon 14 991684 elev 368 m a s

mirabella eclano at about 1 km distance from the farm period 2003 2013 the trial was carried out in 2011 and 2012 in a rainfed vitis vinifera l cv aglianico vineyard planted in the year 2000 grafted

pruning the vines under investigation were located along a slope length 90 m inclination β 10 at two different sites of the vineyard the up slope site and the down slope site at each of the two sites bonfante et al 2015 later identified a functional homogeneous zone and the soils were classified according to the iuss working group w r b 2014 as calcisol clayic aric in the upper part of the slope 60 m and cambisol clayic aric colluvic in the lower part 30 m with horizon distribution as shown in fig 1 an agrometeorological station was installed to measure rain and net solar radiation relative humidity air temperature and wind speed at 2 m above the ground to estimate the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 by the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 2 soil characterisation soil hydraulic properties were determined in laboratory on undisturbed soil samples collected in steel cylinders 15 cm high and 8 cm in diameter with a volume of 750 cm3 from each of the soil horizons terribile et al 2018 in the laboratory saturated hydraulic conductivity k0 was measured by a falling head permeameter reynolds and elrick 2002 the soil water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity curve k θ were determined by applying the evaporation method arya 2002 moreover some points at a lower water content of the dry branch of the water retention curve were determined by a dew point system wp4 dew point potentiometer decagon devices inc soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by fitting eq s 2 and 3 see section 2 4 to measured data details of the tests and overall calculation procedures were described by basile et al 2012 and monaco et al 2014 2 3 field monitoring soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 was assessed in the root zone by applying the empirical topp s formula to the soil bulk dielectric permittivity measured by time domain reflectometry tdr technique robinson et al 2003 eight three wire tdr probes were installed in duplicate along the cambisol down slope at four different soil depths two vertically at a depth of 0 15 cm and six horizontally 30 60 and 100 cm eight probes were installed in duplicate along the calcisol up slope at four different soil depths two vertically at a depth of 0 15 cm and eight horizontally 35 75 and 105 cm the data were acquired every 6 h by means of tdr100 and cr10 acquisition system campbell inc and then daily averaged leaf water potential ψl mpa was measured on a well expanded fully light exposed leaf of 10 vines for each site using a scholander type pressure bomb saps ii 3115 soilmoisture equipment corp

time on three occasions in both years net photosynthetic co2 assimilation a μmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance to water vapour g s mol m 2 s 1 were measured by means of a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 40 licor lincoln ne usa on un detached leaves which were chosen as reported for leaf water potential actinic light was provided by an artificial red and blue led source with 470 and 630

leaf chamber co2 molar ratio at 400 μmol mol 1 the instrument software calculated the various gas exchange parameters on the basis of the von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 model measurements were taken between 10 00 to 12 00 solar time on three occasions in both years a linear accupar lp 80 par lai ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa was used to measure light interception by the vineyard canopy to estimate the vineyard leaf area index lai m2 m 2 the ceptometer had 80 photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd sensors spaced at 1 cm intervals and it was programmed to average readings of

rows ppfd was also measured above the canopy measurements were taken between 10 00 to 13 00 solar time on several occasions in both years the instrument software calculated lai by following the norman jarvis campbell norman model campbell and norman 1989 which requires the measurement of both incident and below canopy radiation 2 4 model description the simulations were performed by hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 that allowed simulating two dimensional water flow in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac estimating the root water uptake by incorporating a sink term in the flow equation it was based on the numerical resolution of the richards equation in two dimensional water flow using galerkin type linear finite element schemes 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s x z h where x and z

parametric form soil water retention curves were described by the unimodal θ h relationship proposed by van genuchten 1980 and expressed here in terms of the effective saturation se as follows 2 s e 1

dimensionless b x 1 z 1 is the normalized spatial root water uptake distribution w is the width of the soil surface associated with transpiration and t p is the potential daily crop transpiration the soil water stress response function assumes values between 0 and 1 and it is defined by a piecewise function of the pressure head whose characteristics values are h 0 pressure head below which roots

computational module each flow domain i e up slope and down slope is characterised by two different crop parameterisations for the two sites in particular with this module it is possible to consider the specific root spatial distribution the water stress function and the temporal dynamics of the potential transpiration for each site the model requires both daily potential transpiration tp and daily potential evaporation ep as input variables at the top boundary conditions the potential evapotranspiration et p was partitioned into tp and ep by the following equations ritchie 1972 5 e p e t p e k l a i 6 t p e t p e p where k is the light extinction coefficient the lai values were measured several times during the vegetative season and then linearly interpolated to obtain the daily temporal dynamics in both years at the two sites further details on the hydrus 2d 3d code can be found in karandish and šimůnek 2016 and šejna et al 2011 2 5 model parameterisation and scenario analysis fig 1 shows the two dimensional simulation domain 1 5 m deep and 90 m long two simulations were carried out in the first case by considering a simulation domain with a slope β 10 corresponding to the real field scenario and in the second case by considering a horizontal domain corresponding to a theoretical scenario β 0 two years were simulated from 1st january 2011 to 31st december 2012 for a total of 731 days with a daily time step according to field observation of 2011 the vegetative season for both sites started on 5th may and ended on 15th october in 2012 the vegetative season started in the up slope site on 2nd may and in the down slope position two weeks later 18th may in 2012 for both sites the season ended on 15th october for both years the horizontal flow domain was discretised by a mesh with 42 996 nodes and 83 250 triangular elements while the sloped transport domain was discretised by 42 057 nodes and 81 330 2d elements the mesh was finer on the top layer where the larger hydraulic gradients occurred unit gradient dh dz 1 condition was assumed at the bottom boundary and the absence of flux was assumed on the lateral boundary the flow domain consisted of two homogeneous zones corresponding to two soil types calcisol for the first 60 m and cambisol for the remaining 30 m the top boundary condition was defined by atmospheric inflow rain and outflow evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation lai was measured in each flow domain reaching a maximum of 2 0 and 2 8 m2 m 2 for up slope and down slope soil respectively the parameters of root distribution were determined once in the field after opening the soil profiles and the maximum root depth in particular was 60 and 85 cm in the up slope and down slope sites respectively relative root density for both sites was set equal to 1 from the surface till the maximum root depth coefficients of the piecewise soil water stress response function were set as h 0 1 cm h opt 10 cm h 2h 400 cm h 2 l 600 cm h 3 15 000 cm the soil water status at the beginning of the simulation was set to h 100 cm assuming this value as a reasonable estimation of wet season conditions this assumption is consistent with the low sensitivity of the model to the initial condition for 2 year runs autovino et al 2018 in order to compare the outputs of the up and down slope sites in each scenario 16 observation nodes were selected eight observation nodes were selected 3 m away from the left side of the transport domain while the other eight were selected 87 m away from the same side in order to be representative of up slope and down slope sites respectively in both cases the observation nodes were selected at eight different depths 10 30 40 50 60 70 80 100 cm to explore the root zone hydrus 2d 3d was calibrated and validated during the years 2011 and 2012 respectively by comparing measured see section 2 3 and simulated soil water content for several soil depths for both soils the adjusted soil hydraulic parameters following the calibration procedure are reported in table 1 2 6 model testing and statistical analysis in order to test the performance of the hydrus 2d 3d model the simulated dynamics of soil water content were compared to the measured one in both sites at four depths 10 40 60 and 80 cm and for both years three statistical parameters mean bias error mbe root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were applied 7 m b e i 1 n θ m e a s i θ s i m i n 8 r m s e i 1 n θ m e a s i θ s i m i

level mean separation was performed by snk test using sas university edition cary nc usa 3 results 3 1 plant responses leaf water status gas exchange and leaf growth at the two sites were not statistically different in mid june for both years afterwards the down slope vines had a significantly higher ψl better water status than the up slope vines in both years the maximum difference was detected in early september when ψl averaged 1 63 mpa in the up slope vines significantly lower than in the down slope vines where it ranged between 1 11 to 0 78 mpa table 2 as with leaf water potential both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic assimilation showed significant differences between the two sites after mid june in early september of both years stomatal conductance of up slope vines decreased to an average value of 0 053 mol m 2 s 1 at that time g s in the up slope vines was 21 in the first year and 28 in the second year of what it was in the down slope vines leaf assimilation reflected the pattern of stomatal conductance from the highest values observed in early july a in the up slope vines decreased in early september of the first and second years to 5 9 and 3 9 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively being 42 and 36 of that in the down slope vines a significant difference was observed in lai between the two sites from early september in the first year when it was 1 60 m2 m 2 in down slope vines i e 0 37 m2 m 2 higher than in up slope vines a similar significant difference between the two sites was detected in early july of the second year when lai in down slope vines was 1 85 m2 m 2 3 2 model simulations 3 2 1 climate the temporal dynamics of both rainfall etp and furthermore tp for both sites are shown in fig 2 these variables represent the upper boundary condition for the hydrus 2d 3d simulations the total rainfall in 2011 550 mm was similar to 2012 553 mm the total rainfall from may to the end of september was 198 mm in 2011 and 144 mm in 2012 in 2011 two spells of rainfall of about 30 mm each occurred in mid september while in 2012 one spell of rainfall of 60 mm occurred at the end of july followed by moderate rains during september fig 2 the resulting yearly et p was equal to 793 mm in 2011 and 879 mm in 2012 having in general the same annual trend in both years in the period from may to late september etp was 448 mm in 2011 and 522 mm in 2012 in the vegetative season tp in the up slope site was 176 mm in 2011 and 217 mm in 2012 while down slope it was 217 and 244 mm respectively 3 2 2 model evaluation fig 3 shows the dynamics of measured and simulated soil water content in the up slope and down slope soil profiles data refer to both years and four different depths at which the soil water content was measured the model well represents both the wetting and drying processes especially in the two upper layers of both soils where most of the root uptake occurred a slightly worse estimation was detected at 75 and 105 cm depth of the up slope soil for 2011 the results of statistical analysis carried out to compare simulated and measured soil water contents in 2011 and 2012 are reported in table 3 the rmse during the calibration period 2011 was 0 03 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for up and down slope sites respectively with a slight overestimation in the up slope site mbe 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and a slight underestimation in the down slope site mbe 0 02 cm3 cm 3 the nse was positive for both sites during the validation period 2012 rmse was slightly worse for both sites while the mbe showed a slight underestimation for both sites even during the validation the nse was positive for both sites 3 2 3 modelling procedure fig 4 shows the simulated soil water content of the up slope a and down slope b soil profiles under the two slope gradient settings β 0 and β 10 data refer to two years and three different depths 10 cm 40 cm and 60 cm being representative of the three horizons where the root water uptake occurs in the up slope soil fig 4a the simulated soil water content for both slope gradient settings perfectly overlaps for all the three depths in the down slope soil fig 4b some differences arise between the two simulations except for the upper layer where the simulations nearly overlap in the β 10 setting at a depth of 40 cm the effect of the slope gradient produces an average daily increment of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 in soil water content during the two years a slight average increment of 0 009 cm3 cm 3 was also detected at the deeper layer of 60 cm for all simulations the soil water content peaks to higher values corresponding with the rainy events this is more evident at the shallow depth being smoothed at greater depths the simulated average pressure head during the experiment in the rooting zone of the up slope and down slope sites under the two slope gradients β 0 and β 10 is shown in fig 5 during a prolonged dry period august september 2011 and august october 2012 it is evident that for both β settings pressure head in the up slope soil is much lower than in the down slope soil during the wet period october 2011 june 2012 the up slope soil shows higher average pressure head than down slope soil and this behaviour holds for both β settings after a prolonged dry period pressure head in the up slope soil reaches the lowest value of 7093 cm in β 0 setting and 7212 cm in β 10 setting on 12th september 2011 at the same time pressure head in the down slope soil reaches 2995 cm in β 0 and 2534 cm in β 10 setting as in 2011 in the dry periods of 2012 also the up slope soil h values were lower than for down slope soil the cumulative actual transpiration ta of vines at the two sites for both years and for both slope gradient settings is shown in fig 6 at each site and in both years the ta curve at β 10 overlaps the curve at β 0 the vegetative season in 2012 for up slope vines started two weeks earlier than for down slope vines and the two curves intersect each other at the end of july for both sites the cumulative actual transpiration at the end of the season in 2011 is lower than in 2012 especially for the up slope vines 4 discussion the effect of slope gradient and soil hydraulic properties on water balance and plant responses are usually analysed as a unique effect and not quantitatively separated a two year experiment was carried out on an aglianico vineyard characterised by calcisol soil at the top and cambisol soil at the bottom of slope the two soils were dissimilar due to several pedogenetic factors taking place e g geomorphology and therefore were characterised by different depths and hydrological properties table 1 despite the same clay loam texture hydrus 2d 3d was applied to quantify the effect of these two slope components on the differences between up and down sites in soil water content pressure head and vine transpiration physiological and leaf growth measurements were carried out to assess the occurrence of vine stress in the two sites 4 1 plant response during the summer in both years vines encountered higher stress conditions at the up as compared to the down slope site as shown by lower leaf water potential table 2 vine responses were in accord with the soil pressure head being lower in the up slope than in the down slope site fig 7 intensity duration and rate of occurrence of plant water stress are crucial factors affecting vine growth and photosynthesis schultz 2003 observed that ψl decreased from about 0 8 mpa in late june to about 1 7 mpa in late summer a common condition found in vineyards in the mediterranean environment we observed similar water deficit ranges which according to the thresholds proposed by van leeuwen et al 2009 indicated that no stress conditions occurred in mid june at either site in the two years instead in early september mild or no water deficit occurred in down slope vines while up slope vines experienced severe stress conditions in both years stomatal conductance remained moderately high in the down slope vines throughout the experiment conversely g s in the up slope vines averaged quite low values 0 053 mol m 2 s 1 in early september as highlighted by cifre et al 2005 this indicated severe stress conditions characterised by strong photosynthetic limitations accordingly photosynthetic assimilation in late summer in up slope was about 40 of that for down slope vines growth reduction is the first plant response to water stress hsiao 1973 and as with stomatal closure represents a drought avoidance mechanism to limit water loss however control of vine growth was pursued by the grower through both pruning and fruit thinning as reviewed by poni et al 2018 a number of papers published until early 2000 highlighted the positive role played by the physical properties of rocky gravelly shallow and coarse textured soils on grape and wine quality later limited soil water holding capacity was related to vine stress and grape and wine quality in our case study the up soil had lower water capacity than down soil which imposed water stress in up soil vines the literature reports that water stress can reduce yield and improve grape quality poni et al 2018 and references therein actually for the same experimental site our research group reported lower grape yield and better quality of the grape must and wine in the up than in the down slope vines bonfante et al 2015 2017 4 2 model simulation in order to assess the hydrus 2d 3d model s ability to simulate the different variables involved in spac we validated it considering the measured soil water content the model performance expressed in terms of rmse values of soil water content as shown in table 3 was comparable with that obtained by bonfante et al 2017 at the same experimental site using the 1 d swap model in fact the soil physical system and its parameterisation in both models are described in the same way and therefore the simulated water flows in the spac are comparable peters and griffioen 2006 sorensen 2008 furthermore both rmse and mbe values are comparable with those obtained by phogat et al 2017 in a modelling study carried out on a vineyard in australia by the hydrus 2d model the good performance of the simulation is also confirmed by the positive nse index therefore the reliable parameterisation of the field scenario β 10 allows further inferences to be carried out in the case of slope absence β 0 hence we performed a numerical experiment as a viable way to separate the two effects in the up slope soil throughout the experiment the slope gradient did not affect soil water content for the three soil depths fig 4a which means that the soil water balance was unaffected in the down slope soil fig 4b the simulated water content at β 10 was slightly higher than at β 0 at the two deepest depths as reported in fig 7 the flow velocity vectors of water transport simulated for 2 m transect in the down slope site allow to better understand the soil water processes fig 7a relates to the simulation a week after a rainy period 1st may 2012 when the whole soil profile except the uppermost layer was wet as shown by the pressure head profile reaching about 100 cm the vectors in the top 10 cm of the soils are pointing upwards indicating the occurrence of an evaporation process while at 20 cm depth there is a zone of zero fluxes in the layers below the flow lines channel downwards with increasing angles from those parallel to the slope β 10 to the vertical ones in the deepest layers these differences along the depth come from the different hydraulic properties of the horizons fig 7 enlightens the complexity of processes occurring in the soil motivating the use of physically based models to investigate such complexity the direction of the velocity vectors explains the increase in water content at greater depths in the down slope site with β 10 setting therefore flow vectors indicate the contribution of the slope gradient to the root zone water balance at the bottom of the slope the increase in soil water content due to the whole slope effect as an average along the root zone from mid may to end september of both years was as low as 0 02 cm3 cm 3 with a maximum of 0 04 cm3 cm 3 fig 4b the contribution due only to the slope gradient is almost negligible because the vector velocities are quite low 0 6 cm d 1 under much drier conditions 15th august 2011 when soil pressure head profile almost reached on average 800 cm all vectors channel upward in the whole root zone fig 7b indicating the total absence of lateral flow due to slope gradient these results confirm that the drier the soil the less important is the role of the slope gradient on the water balance as reported in the literature del toro guerrero et al 2018 famiglietti et al 1998 mei et al 2018 western and grayson 2000 this result is also confirmed by the analysis of the pressure heads fig 5 in the dry period of 2011 july september the difference between the two continuous and dotted thinner lines δh β 0 represents the effect of soil hydraulic properties only maximum delta 4100 the difference between the two thicker lines δh β 10 instead represents the effect of both soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient max delta 4700 cm therefore the difference between these two values 600 cm can be attributed to the sole effect of slope gradient at the end of a long dry period a similar behaviour can be observed in the 2012 dry periods unlike the dry periods during the wet period october 2011 march 2012 up slope soil pressure head was higher than in down slope such behaviour depends on the water retention curve of the two soils with the down slope soil having 20 more water storage capacity than up slope soil therefore the amount of rainfall that occurred was not able to refill the greater tank of the down slope soil while refilling occurred to a higher extent for the smaller tank of the up slope soil the latter reaching higher values of pressure head to evaluate the slope effect on vine performance we simulated the cumulative vine actual transpiration ta over the two years fig 6 ta for the two sites in both β settings was lower in 2011 than 2012 as the former year showed lower cumulative potential transpiration tp despite higher rainfall in both years the contribution of the slope gradient to vine transpiration was almost negligible since for each site position the ta curves for the two β settings overlap therefore the lower transpiration in up than in down slope vines was mainly due to the difference in both soil hydrological properties and potential transpiration the latter is strongly dependent on the lai which was higher in down than in up slope vines in order to evaluate the slope effect on vine performance without the influence of the different tp we considered the relative cumulative transpiration ta tp during the two years table 4 the differences in ta tp between the two sites under the field slope gradient β 10 are due to the combination of hydrological properties and slope gradient 8 difference in 2011 and 5 in 2012 focussing on the down slope vines the model indicated no difference in ta tp between the two β settings demonstrating that there is no contribution of the soil gradient to vine response these findings were obtained in the absence of runoff and with the same aspect of up and down slope soils that resulted in the lack of any significant difference in total potential insolation bonfante et al 2015 runoff and aspect indeed could affect the water balance and therefore their occurrence should be checked and eventually taken into account if the procedure were to be applied elsewhere 5 conclusion in our case study representative of many hilly mediterranean vineyards developed over marl soil water status and vine performance were mainly influenced by the effect caused by differences in soil hydrological properties between up slope and down slope soils rather than by slope gradients these findings demonstrate the crucial importance of the geomorphological setting which goes well beyond the simple slope gradient to the topography elements affecting soil formation soil properties and specifically soil hydraulic properties spac processes and eventually yield and quality of grape must and wine in this work we developed a straightforward and viable modelling procedure to analyse two of the components behind the slope effect opening the way to further expand this analysis to many other hilly viticulture sites and to address many issues related to viticulture management and planning this also refers to the crucial issue of adaptation of viticulture to climate change considering also the intense competition in the viticulture sector in such a framework the potential of hilly viticulture could be exploited by orientating vineyard management and then oenological techniques for up slope and down slope wines towards market requirements this numerical procedure theoretically has no limitations in being applied to other case studies having different slopes and different soils from those examined in the present study on the other hand since soil geospatial distribution can be complex we must be cautious in generalising our findings such as the trend of water potential between up slope and down slope positions in fact in other viticulture landscapes due to different local soil development we may obtain contrasting applied results e g opposite trend in water potential between up slope and down slope position with respect to our case study however even in those cases our numerical procedure is still valid and if properly calibrated it can be successfully applied to manage such vineyards also it may represent a further

10495,grapevine is a widespread crop for grape and wine production often cultivated on hilly areas moderate vine water stress plays an important role in determining high quality viticulture however a precise quantification of the effect of hydraulic properties and slope gradient on hilly soil water balance and consequently on vine stress has not yet been addressed in the literature the slope gradient effect is generally taken for granted without providing experiments validating such a qualitative assumption we tested the hypothesis that soil hydraulic properties play a greater role than slope gradient in driving soil water status and vine stress in two consecutive years we studied an aglianico vineyard grown along a 90 m slope with up slope soil having lower water holding capacity than down slope up slope vines were more stressed as shown by lower leaf water potential stomatal conductance leaf co2 assimilation and leaf area index than down slope vines water flow was simulated by using the hydrus 2d 3d model calibrated and validated towards a two year set of soil water content measurements significantly lower soil pressure head and higher transpiration occurred in the up than the down slope site a viable procedure was developed to separate the effects of soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient by modelling soil water balance and therefore vine transpiration with and without the slope gradient the simulations indicated that the difference in seasonal relative transpiration of 8 in 2011 and 5 in 2012 between the two sites was due to their differing soil hydraulic properties and that the slope gradient had no contribution to this variation keywords vineyard hydraulic properties vine water stress hydrus 2d 3d modelling 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera l is a species well adapted to mild winters and hot summers with limited precipitation during most of the growing season williams et al 1994 as in the mediterranean area in this environment it is very important to address vine water stress as grape and wine quality can be improved by moderate water stress during specific phenological stages ojeda et al 2002 van leeuwen et al 2009 medrano et al 2003 in a 10 year experiment indicated that soil water availability affected vine water status inhibiting leaf photosynthesis with a negative effect on yield drought can give rise to vine water stress especially when vineyards are grown in soils with limited water holding capacity brillante et al 2017 tramontini et al 2013 poni et al 2018 pointed out that texture and structure of soil as they affect the soil hydraulic properties influence the water holding capacity and therefore the proneness of vines to water stress while chemical properties play only a minor role it is well known that high quality viticulture in the mediterranean region is commonly located in hilly areas prosdocimi et al 2016 slope gradient aspect radiation surface runoff soil water flow and soil hydraulic properties all related to the geomorphological setting are considered of primary importance for stress related vineyard performance under real field conditions even if each of the abovementioned factors could be measured the effect on water balance and vine response of every single factor is hard to quantify therefore in the literature they are generally mixed up biddoccu et al 2017 hofmann and schultz 2015 peyrard et al 2016 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 and a precise quantification of the effect of each factor has not been yet addressed this lack of knowledge is unfortunate in fact understanding the impact of the above slope related factors on grape quality is fundamental to improve management of hilly viticulture and even more importantly to support the climate change adaptation of mediterranean viticulture bonfante et al 2017 in this paper we focus on the effects of slope gradient and soil hydraulic properties on water balance and vine response the evidence about the importance of both slope gradient and slope position on soil properties dates back to the 1930s milne 1936 demonstrated the sequential change of soils along hill slopes due to erosional and depositional processes and most importantly the variation in subsurface drainage lateral transport of sediments and translocation of materials at or beneath the soil surface catena concept this concept has been widely demonstrated over the years in the specific case of viticulture it has been demonstrated that soil hydrological properties can markedly change along a slope bonfante et al 2015 casanova et al 2000 famiglietti et al 1998 and that up slope vines are more prone to stress as soils there commonly have lower water holding capacity than down slope soils papers in the literature have focused on the slope effects on soil hydraulic conductivity bodner et al 2008 and soil moisture distribution e g battany and grismer 2000 some authors have reported that up slope soils can potentially be subjected to water flow with consequent accumulation of water downwards of the slope biddoccu et al 2017 brillante et al 2017 however western and grayson 2000 observed that the distribution of moisture in hillslope soils is strongly influenced by the slope gradient during the wet periods while during the dry periods there is little topographic influence this result was confirmed by nasta et al 2013 in southern italian landscapes dominated by pasture orchards and grassland however there is lack of knowledge and methodologies to discriminate or quantify the role played by the soil hydraulic properties resulting from the effect of slope gradient in producing differences in soil water content and therefore in vine stress most importantly the role of the slope gradient in producing different water stress and consequently different vineyard responses is generally taken for granted without providing real or numerical experiments to validate such a qualitative assumption it is especially important to build up a robust and viable process based numerical procedure for understanding the impact of soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient on soil and vine water status in pursuance of this aim we tested the hypothesis that soil hydrological properties could play the predominant role as compared to slope gradient in producing differences in soil water status and vine stress between up and down slope sites this hypothesis was tested with the hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 extensively used to simulate movement of water in the soil plant atmosphere system this model has been widely applied for different crops such as almond phogat et al 2012 maize scognamiglio et al 2019 eggplant ghazouani et al 2016 citrus phogat et al 2014 olive orchards autovino et al 2018 and wine grapes phogat et al 2017 thus the hydrus 2d 3d model was applied in a field experiment carried out over two consecutive years at a vineyard in a hilly area where both up slope and down slope soil water status and vine physiological responses were monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site the experiment was performed in a 2 3 ha farm oriented to

soil hydraulic properties were determined in laboratory on undisturbed soil samples collected in steel cylinders 15 cm high and 8 cm in diameter with a volume of 750 cm3 from each of the soil horizons

conductivity curve k θ were determined by applying the evaporation method arya 2002 moreover some points at a lower water content of the dry branch of the water retention curve were determined by a dew point system wp4 dew point potentiometer decagon devices inc soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by fitting eq s 2 and 3 see section 2 4 to measured data details of the tests and overall calculation procedures were described by basile et al 2012 and monaco et al 2014 2 3 field monitoring soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 was assessed in the root zone by applying the empirical topp s formula to the soil bulk dielectric permittivity measured by time domain reflectometry tdr technique robinson et al 2003 eight three wire tdr probes were installed in duplicate along the cambisol down slope at four different soil depths two vertically at a depth of 0 15 cm and six horizontally 30 60 and 100 cm eight probes were installed in duplicate along the calcisol up slope at four different soil depths two vertically at a depth of 0 15 cm and eight horizontally 35 75 and 105 cm the data were acquired every 6 h by means of tdr100 and cr10 acquisition system campbell inc and then daily averaged leaf water potential ψl mpa was measured on a well expanded fully light exposed leaf of 10 vines for each site using a scholander type pressure bomb saps ii 3115 soilmoisture equipment corp

time on three occasions in both years net photosynthetic co2 assimilation a μmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance to water vapour g s mol m 2 s 1 were measured by means of a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 40 licor lincoln ne usa on un detached leaves which were chosen as reported for leaf water potential actinic light was provided by an artificial red and blue led source with 470 and 630

leaf chamber co2 molar ratio at 400 μmol mol 1 the instrument software calculated the various gas exchange parameters on the basis of the von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 model measurements were taken between 10 00 to 12 00 solar time on three occasions in both years a linear accupar lp 80 par lai ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa was used to measure light interception by the vineyard

jarvis campbell norman model campbell and norman 1989 which requires the measurement of both incident and below canopy radiation 2 4 model description the simulations were performed by hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 that allowed simulating two dimensional water flow in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac estimating the root water uptake by incorporating a sink term in the flow equation it was based on the numerical resolution of the richards equation in two dimensional water flow using galerkin type linear finite element schemes 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s x z h where x and z

computational module each flow domain i e up slope and down slope is characterised by two different crop parameterisations for the two sites in particular with this module it is possible to consider the specific root spatial distribution the water stress function and the temporal dynamics of the potential transpiration for each site the model requires both daily potential transpiration tp and daily potential evaporation ep as input variables at the top boundary conditions the potential evapotranspiration et p was partitioned into tp and ep by the following equations ritchie 1972 5 e p e t p e k l a i 6 t p e t p e p where k is the light extinction coefficient the lai values were measured several times during the vegetative season and then linearly interpolated to obtain the daily temporal dynamics in both years at the two sites further details on the hydrus 2d 3d code can be found in karandish and šimůnek 2016 and šejna et al 2011 2 5 model parameterisation and scenario analysis fig 1 shows the two dimensional simulation domain 1 5 m deep and 90 m long two simulations were carried out in the first case by considering a simulation domain with a slope β 10 corresponding to the real field scenario and in the second case by considering a horizontal domain corresponding to a theoretical scenario β 0 two years were simulated from 1st january 2011 to 31st december 2012 for a total of 731 days with a daily time step according to field observation of 2011 the vegetative season for both sites started on 5th may and ended on 15th october in 2012 the vegetative season started in the up slope site on 2nd may and in the down slope position two weeks later 18th may in 2012 for both sites the season ended on 15th october for both years the horizontal flow domain was discretised by a mesh with 42 996 nodes and 83 250 triangular elements while the sloped transport domain was discretised by 42 057 nodes and 81 330 2d elements the mesh was finer on the top layer where the larger hydraulic gradients occurred unit gradient dh dz 1 condition was assumed at the bottom boundary and the absence of flux was assumed on the lateral boundary the flow domain consisted of two homogeneous zones corresponding to two soil types calcisol for the first 60 m and cambisol for the remaining 30 m the top boundary condition was defined by atmospheric inflow rain and outflow evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation lai was measured in each flow domain reaching a maximum of 2 0 and 2 8 m2 m 2 for up slope and down slope soil respectively the parameters of root distribution were determined once in the field after opening the soil profiles and the maximum root depth in particular was 60 and 85 cm in the up slope and down slope sites respectively relative root density for both sites was set equal to 1 from the surface till the maximum root depth coefficients of the piecewise soil water stress response function were set as h 0 1 cm h opt 10 cm h 2h 400 cm h 2 l 600 cm h 3 15 000 cm the soil water status at the beginning of the simulation was set to h 100 cm assuming this value as a reasonable estimation of wet season conditions this assumption is consistent with the low sensitivity of the model to the initial condition for 2 year runs autovino et al 2018 in order to compare the outputs of the up and down slope sites in each scenario 16 observation nodes were selected eight observation nodes were selected 3 m away from the left side of the transport domain while the other eight were selected 87 m away from the same side in order to be representative of up slope and down slope sites respectively in both cases the observation nodes were selected at eight different depths 10 30 40 50 60 70 80 100 cm to explore the root zone hydrus 2d 3d was calibrated and validated during the years 2011 and 2012 respectively by comparing measured see section 2 3 and simulated soil water content for several soil depths for both soils the adjusted soil hydraulic parameters following the calibration procedure are reported in table 1 2 6 model testing and statistical analysis in order to test the performance of the hydrus 2d 3d model the simulated dynamics of soil water content were compared to the measured one in both sites at four depths 10 40 60 and 80 cm and for both years three statistical parameters

level mean separation was performed by snk test using sas university edition cary nc usa 3 results 3 1 plant responses leaf water status gas exchange and leaf growth at the two sites were not statistically different in mid june for both years afterwards the down slope vines had a significantly higher ψl better water status than the up slope vines in both years the maximum difference was detected in early september when ψl averaged 1 63 mpa in the up slope vines significantly lower than in the down slope vines where it ranged between 1 11 to 0 78 mpa table 2 as with leaf water potential both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic assimilation showed significant differences between the two sites after mid june in early september of both years stomatal conductance of up slope vines decreased to an average value of 0 053 mol m 2 s 1 at that time g s in the up slope vines was 21 in the first year and 28 in the second year of what it was in the down slope vines leaf assimilation reflected the pattern of stomatal conductance from the highest values observed in early july a in the up slope vines decreased in early september of the first and second years to 5 9 and 3 9 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively being 42 and 36 of that in the down slope vines a significant difference was observed in lai between the two sites from early september in the first year when it was 1 60 m2 m 2 in down slope vines i e 0 37 m2 m 2 higher than in up slope vines a similar significant difference between the two sites was detected in early july of the second year when lai in down slope vines was 1 85 m2 m 2 3 2 model simulations 3 2 1 climate the temporal dynamics of both rainfall etp and furthermore tp for both sites are shown in fig 2 these variables represent the upper boundary condition for the hydrus 2d 3d simulations the total rainfall in 2011 550 mm was similar to 2012 553 mm the total rainfall from may to the end of september was 198 mm in 2011 and 144 mm in 2012 in 2011 two spells of rainfall of about 30 mm each occurred in mid september while in 2012 one spell of rainfall of 60 mm occurred at the end of july followed by moderate rains during september fig 2 the resulting yearly et p was equal to 793 mm in 2011 and 879 mm in 2012 having in general the same annual trend in both years in the period from may to late september etp was 448 mm in 2011 and 522 mm in 2012 in the vegetative season tp in the up slope site was 176 mm in 2011 and 217 mm in 2012 while down slope it was 217 and 244 mm respectively 3 2 2 model evaluation fig 3 shows the dynamics of measured and simulated soil water content in the up slope and down slope soil profiles data refer to both years and four different depths at which the soil water content was measured the model well represents both the wetting and drying processes especially in the two upper layers of both soils where most of the root uptake occurred a slightly worse estimation was detected at 75 and 105 cm depth of the up slope soil for 2011 the results of statistical analysis carried out to compare simulated and measured soil water contents in 2011 and 2012 are reported in table 3 the rmse during the calibration period 2011 was 0 03 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for up and down slope sites respectively with a slight overestimation in the up slope site mbe 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and a slight underestimation in the down slope site mbe 0 02 cm3 cm 3 the nse was positive for both sites during the validation period 2012 rmse was slightly worse for both sites while the mbe showed a slight underestimation for both sites even during the validation the nse was positive for both sites 3 2 3 modelling procedure fig 4 shows the simulated soil water content of the up slope a and down slope b soil profiles under the two slope gradient settings β 0 and β 10 data refer to two years and three different depths 10 cm 40 cm and 60 cm being representative of the three horizons where the root water uptake occurs in the up slope soil fig 4a the simulated soil water content for both slope gradient settings perfectly overlaps for all the three depths in the down slope soil fig 4b some differences arise between the two simulations except for the upper layer where the simulations nearly overlap in the β 10 setting at a depth of 40 cm the effect of the slope gradient produces an average daily increment of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 in soil water content during the two years a slight average increment of 0 009 cm3 cm 3 was also detected at the deeper layer of 60 cm for all simulations the soil water content peaks to higher values corresponding with the rainy events this is more evident at the shallow depth being smoothed at greater depths the simulated average pressure head during the experiment in the rooting zone of the up slope and down slope sites under the two slope gradients β 0 and β 10 is shown in fig 5 during a prolonged dry period august september 2011 and august october 2012 it is evident that for both β settings pressure head in the up slope soil is much lower than in the down slope soil during the wet period october 2011 june 2012 the up slope soil shows higher average pressure head than down slope soil and this behaviour holds for both β settings after a prolonged dry period pressure head in the up slope soil reaches the lowest value of 7093 cm in β 0 setting and 7212 cm in β 10 setting on 12th september 2011 at the same time pressure head in the down slope soil reaches 2995 cm in β 0 and 2534 cm in β 10 setting as in 2011 in the dry periods of 2012 also the up slope soil h values were lower than for down slope soil the cumulative actual transpiration ta of vines at the two sites for both years and for both slope gradient settings is shown in fig 6 at each site and in both years the ta curve at β 10 overlaps the curve at β 0 the vegetative season in 2012 for up slope vines started two weeks earlier than for down slope vines and the two curves intersect each other at the end of july for both sites the cumulative actual transpiration at the end of the season in 2011 is lower than in 2012 especially for the up slope vines 4 discussion the effect of slope gradient and soil hydraulic properties on water balance and plant responses are usually analysed as a unique effect and not quantitatively separated a two year experiment was carried out on an aglianico vineyard characterised by calcisol soil at the top and cambisol soil at the bottom of slope the two soils were dissimilar due to several pedogenetic factors taking place e g geomorphology and therefore were characterised by different depths and hydrological properties table 1 despite the same clay loam texture hydrus 2d 3d was applied to quantify the effect of these two slope components on the differences between up and down sites in soil water content pressure head and vine transpiration physiological and leaf growth measurements were carried out to assess the occurrence of vine stress in the two sites 4 1 plant response during the summer in both years vines encountered higher stress conditions at the up as compared to the down slope site as shown by lower leaf water potential table 2 vine responses were in accord with the soil pressure head being lower in the up slope than in the down slope site fig 7 intensity duration and rate of occurrence of plant water stress are crucial factors affecting vine growth and photosynthesis schultz 2003 observed that ψl decreased from about 0 8 mpa in late june to about 1 7 mpa in late summer a common condition found in vineyards in the mediterranean environment we observed similar water deficit ranges which according to the thresholds proposed by van leeuwen et al 2009 indicated that no stress conditions occurred in mid june at either site in the two years instead in early september mild or no water deficit occurred in down slope vines while up slope vines experienced severe stress conditions in both years stomatal conductance remained moderately high in the down slope vines throughout the experiment conversely g s in the up slope vines averaged quite low values 0 053 mol m 2 s 1 in early september as highlighted by cifre et al 2005 this indicated severe stress conditions characterised by strong photosynthetic limitations accordingly photosynthetic assimilation in late summer in up slope was about 40 of that for down slope vines growth reduction is the first plant response to water stress hsiao 1973 and as with stomatal closure represents a drought avoidance mechanism to limit water loss however control of vine growth was pursued by the grower through both pruning and fruit thinning as reviewed by poni et al 2018 a number of papers published until early 2000 highlighted the positive role played by the physical properties of rocky gravelly shallow and coarse textured soils on grape and wine quality later limited soil water holding capacity was related to vine stress and grape and wine quality in our case study the up soil had lower water capacity than down soil which imposed water stress in up soil vines the literature reports that water stress can reduce yield and improve grape quality poni et al 2018 and references therein actually for the same experimental site our research group reported lower grape yield and better quality of the grape must and wine in the up than in the down slope vines bonfante et al 2015 2017 4 2 model simulation in order to assess the hydrus 2d 3d model s ability to simulate the different variables involved in spac we validated it considering the measured soil water content the model performance expressed in terms of rmse values of soil water content as shown in table 3 was comparable with that obtained by bonfante et al 2017 at the same experimental site using the 1 d swap model in fact the soil physical system and its parameterisation in both models are described in the same way and therefore the simulated water flows in the spac are comparable peters and griffioen 2006 sorensen 2008 furthermore both rmse and mbe values are comparable with those obtained by phogat et al 2017 in a modelling study carried out on a vineyard in australia by the hydrus 2d model the good performance of the simulation is also confirmed by the positive nse index therefore the reliable parameterisation of the field scenario β 10 allows further inferences to be carried out in the case of slope absence β 0 hence we performed a numerical experiment as a viable way to separate the two effects in the up slope soil throughout the experiment the slope gradient did not affect soil water content for the three soil depths fig 4a which means that the soil water balance was unaffected in the down slope soil fig 4b the simulated water content at β 10 was slightly higher than at β 0 at the two deepest depths as reported in fig 7 the flow velocity vectors of water transport simulated for 2 m transect in the down slope site allow to better understand the soil water processes fig 7a relates to the simulation a week after a rainy period 1st may 2012 when the whole soil profile except the uppermost layer was wet as shown by the pressure head profile reaching about 100 cm the vectors in the top 10 cm of the soils are pointing upwards indicating the occurrence of an evaporation process while at 20 cm depth there is a zone of zero fluxes in the layers below the flow lines channel downwards with increasing angles from those parallel to the slope β 10 to the vertical ones in the deepest layers these differences along the depth come from the different hydraulic properties of the horizons fig 7 enlightens the complexity of processes occurring in the soil motivating the use of physically based models to investigate such complexity the direction of the velocity vectors explains the increase in water content at greater depths in the down slope site with β 10 setting therefore flow vectors indicate the contribution of the slope gradient to the root zone water balance at the bottom of the slope the increase in soil water content due to the whole slope effect as an average along the root zone from mid may to end september of both years was as low as 0 02 cm3 cm 3 with a maximum of 0 04 cm3 cm 3 fig 4b the contribution due only to the slope gradient is almost negligible because the vector velocities are quite low 0 6 cm d 1 under much drier conditions 15th august 2011 when soil pressure head profile almost reached on average 800 cm all vectors channel upward in the whole root zone fig 7b indicating the total absence of lateral flow due to slope gradient these results confirm that the drier the soil the less important is the role of the slope gradient on the water balance as reported in the literature del toro guerrero et al 2018 famiglietti et al 1998 mei et al 2018 western and grayson 2000 this result is also confirmed by the analysis of the pressure heads fig 5 in the dry period of 2011 july september the difference between the two continuous and dotted thinner lines δh β 0 represents the effect of soil hydraulic properties only maximum delta 4100 the difference between the two thicker lines δh β 10 instead represents the effect of both soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient max delta 4700 cm therefore the difference between these two values 600 cm can be attributed to the sole effect of slope gradient at the end of a long dry period a similar behaviour can be observed in the 2012 dry periods unlike the dry periods during the wet period october 2011 march 2012 up slope soil pressure head was higher than in down slope such behaviour depends on the water retention curve of the two soils with the down slope soil having 20 more water storage capacity than up slope soil therefore the amount of rainfall that occurred was not able to refill the greater tank of the down slope soil while refilling occurred to a higher extent for the smaller tank of the up slope soil the latter reaching higher values of pressure head to evaluate the slope effect on vine performance we simulated the cumulative vine actual transpiration ta over the two years fig 6 ta for the two sites in both β settings was lower in 2011 than 2012 as the former year showed lower cumulative potential transpiration tp despite higher rainfall in both years the contribution of the slope gradient to vine transpiration was almost negligible since for each site position the ta curves for the two β settings overlap therefore the lower transpiration in up than in down slope vines was mainly due to the difference in both soil hydrological properties and potential transpiration the latter is strongly dependent on the lai which was higher in down than in up slope vines in order to evaluate the slope effect on vine performance without the influence of the different tp we considered the relative cumulative transpiration ta tp during the two years table 4 the differences in ta tp between the two sites under the field slope gradient β 10 are due to the combination of hydrological properties and slope gradient 8 difference in 2011 and 5 in 2012 focussing on the down slope vines the model indicated no difference in ta tp between the two β settings demonstrating that there is no contribution of the soil gradient to vine response these findings were obtained in the absence of runoff and with the same aspect of up and down slope soils that resulted in the lack of any significant difference in total potential insolation bonfante et al 2015 runoff and aspect indeed could affect the water balance and therefore their occurrence should be checked and eventually taken into account if the procedure were to be applied elsewhere 5 conclusion in our case study representative of many hilly mediterranean vineyards developed over marl soil water status and vine performance were mainly influenced by the effect caused by differences in soil hydrological properties between up slope and down slope soils rather than by slope gradients these findings demonstrate the crucial importance of the geomorphological setting which goes well beyond the simple slope gradient to the topography elements affecting soil formation soil properties and specifically soil hydraulic properties spac processes and eventually yield and quality of grape must and wine in this work we developed a straightforward and viable modelling procedure to analyse two of the components behind the slope effect opening the way to further expand this analysis to many other hilly viticulture sites and to address many issues related to viticulture management and planning this also refers to the crucial issue of adaptation of viticulture to climate change considering also the intense competition in the viticulture sector in such a framework the potential of hilly viticulture could be exploited by orientating vineyard management and then oenological techniques for up slope and down slope wines towards market requirements this numerical procedure theoretically has no limitations in being applied to other case studies having different slopes and different soils from those examined in the present study on the other hand since soil geospatial distribution can be complex we must be cautious in generalising our findings such as the trend of water potential between up slope and down slope positions in fact in other viticulture landscapes due to different local soil development we may obtain contrasting applied results e g opposite trend in water potential between up slope and down slope position with respect to our case study however even in those cases our numerical procedure is still valid and if properly calibrated it can be successfully applied to manage such vineyards also it may represent a further

10496,tea plantations camellia sinensis are expanding rapidly in china during the last two decades however the detailed knowledges of water vapor and energy fluxes in tea plantation ecosystem are still absent in this study we explored the temporal variation in water vapor and energy fluxes over a tea plantation through the analysis of 4 year 2014 2017 fluxes data obtained via the eddy covariance technique the results showed that latent heat flux le was the main consumer of net radiation rn le rn ranged from 0 50 to 0 67 at the pruning period april june and dormant period december march at the mid growing season july september and late growing season october november le accounted for more than 0 75 of rn except for the mid growing season in 2016 sensible heat flux h showed an almost opposite trend to le while seasonal variation of soil heat flux g was small the interannual actual evapotranspiration eta was stable in tea plantation ranging from 694 741 mm cv 2 9 despite a large interannual variation in precipitation cv 23 9 the average annual eta accounted for 49 of the corresponding annual precipitation the highest measured daily eta reached 5 2 6 9 mm in july for both years the seasonal variations of daily eta were strongly related to the rn at the mid growing and late growing seasons rn was the limiting factor on eta with high priestley taylor coefficient α 1 05 and decoupling coefficient ω 0 69 in addition low temperature physiological dormancy and vapor pressure deficit vpd at the dormant period and pruning of canopy at the pruning period leading low leaf area index lai also played secondary impacts on eta through their eﬀ ects on canopy surface conductance 10 mm s 1 moreover eta would be significantly affected by soil water availability at the mid growing season due to the large water demand for growth when the soil water was below 0 12 m3 m 3 keywords eddy covariance evapotranspiration energy exchange tea plantation taihu lake basin 1 introduction tea plantations camellia sinensis are distributed worldwide with a total area of 21 1 million ha in 2016 and they are mainly located in subtropical and tropical regions fao 2017 due to considerable economic benefits tea plantations have expanded continuously su et al 2016 in china the area of tea plantation expanded by a factor of 3 during 2001 2016 reaching 3 02 million ha in 2016 nbsc 2018 many local forests e g bamboo forests and mingled forests were cleared and converted to tea plantations fan and han 2020 wang et al 2020 tea plantation has been the major cash crop except for rice and wheat in the hilly areas of southeast china su et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however tea plantations expansion is accompanied with the changes in albedo leaf area and different water use strategies compared to the local ecosystems which would influence the regional water and energy budgets pongratz et al 2006 taylor et al 2002 wang et al 2006 evapotranspiration et plays the critical role in linking the water and energy cycles bossard et al 2015 moiwo and tao 2014 wever et al 2002 hence accurate assessment of et and energy fluxes over tea plantation is essential for better understanding regional climate change water balance and efficient water management although several studies have focused on the et of tea plantations most of them used the bowen ratio energy balance method buttar et al 2018 or lysimeters sikka et al 2009 to our knowledge few studies have quantified et in tea plantation with the eddy covariance ec technique meanwhile previous studies were mainly short term studies lasting less than a year or several days which suggested that irradiance levels were the significant controlling factors on the energy partitioning at the diurnal cycle in tea plantation ecosystems kairu 1993 kigalu 2007 squire 1979 these studies offered partial insights into the dynamics of energy fluxes and et for tea plantation the detailed knowledges about the seasonal and inter annual dynamics in et and energy partitioning over tea plantation ecosystem are lacking in addition the temporal variability of et and energy partitioning are always influenced by interacting meteorological factors vegetation phenology and soil water conditions li et al 2010 ryu et al 2008 yan et al 2017 the control factors on et and energy partitioning in tea plantation ecosystem are also not well understood moreover extreme climate events e g drought and heavy rainfall and the widely applied strong pruning in tree plantations were reported to significantly shift the patterns of energy partitioning lv et al 2012 ma et al 2019 rajan et al 2014 whereas these influences on the et and energy partitioning in tea plantations were also few assessed therefore more knowledge on et and energy partitioning over tea plantation ecosystem are needed based on the long term and high frequency flux measurements taihu lake basin is the key ecological functional area in china with a typical subtropical monsoon climate fig 1 b in the past 15 years agricultural development has intensified especially in the hilly area in the western part of the basin the tianmu lake catchment is one such area in the western taihu lake basin fig 1c which is the typical agricultural development catchment where tea plantations have increased approximately fivefold from 2001 to 2016 reaching up to 2980 ha in 2016 accounting for 12 2 of the catchment area tea plantation expansion in the hilly areas of taihu lake basin would affect regional water and energy balances although the details have not been adequately studied hence it is urgent to understand the processes that control the tea plantation ecosystem energy and water cycles in the region a flux measurement station was established in 2014 aiming at the long term monitoring of tea plantations in the tianmu lake catchment fig 1d e and high frequency energy water and carbon fluxes were obtained over 4 consecutive years the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration eta and investigate its seasonal and interannual variation in tea plantation 2 examine the major meteorological and biophysical controls on eta 3 investigate the influences of tea trees pruning and extreme climate events on eta and energy partitioning for tea plantation ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the measurement site 31 16 14 n 119 27 15 e 103 m altitude with a total area of approximately 30 ha is located at a tea plantation camellia sinensis in the tianmu lake catchment fig 1c the measurement site is located at a hillslope soil slope 5 the vegetation at the site is dominated by tea plantation the tea plantation in our study site is clonal propagation and planted in 2010 with a plant density of 41 250 plants ha and an inter row spacing of 1 5 m the row orientation is east west there are sparse zelkova serrata makino planted in 2013 between the ridges the tea plantation is under the rain fed cultivation and the annual average yield of tea leaves is 450 560 kg ha 1 in our study area the climate of the study region is subtropical monsoon climate with significant seasonality the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 15 8 c and 1146 7 mm the standard monthly data of liyang national meteorological station from 1981 to 2010 respectively the daily air temperature ranged from 3 1 c in january to 28 4 c in july the minimum and maximum annual rainfall were 820 6 1997 and 2159 4 mm 2016 respectively there is a rainy season from april to september and dry season from october to march throughout the year in the rainy season 75 860 mm of annual precipitation occurred during this period the dry season with little precipitation can be divided into a hot dry season october november and a cold dry season december march in the hot dry season the mean temperature was 14 6 c in the cool dry season the mean temperature was low 4 6 c and that was also the dormant period of tea plantations fig 2 shows the general schedule of phenology and management in the study tea plantation in early april farmers began to pick the leaves of tea trees and then pruned the canopy of tea trees april through november is the period of tea plantations growth and contains the phenological events of leaf bud flower bud and flowering following the crop season the canopy height varies from 23 cm april to 115 cm november table 1 crown width of tea plantations have similar seasonal change trend with canopy height which decreased sharply in april due to pruning of tea trees then gradually increased during the growing season and stabilized in october the pattern of ridge spacing is contrary to the two variables the leaf area index lai was closely related to the phenology of the dominant tea plantation with a peak value of 4 6 m2 m 2 in november the ground is covered by pruned branches and tea tree leaves some weeds are growing between the ridges such as setaria viridis l p beauv and digitaria sanguinalis l scop the soil type is a shallow lithosol according to fao classification with soil layer thickness 60 cm and average gravel content 30 the bedrock was sandstone with a large permeability to water liao et al 2016 the soil texture is silt loam according to the usda classification with clay and silt contents approximately 22 0 24 8 and 54 0 54 9 respectively the soils have good infiltration characteristics according to the study of zhu et al 2014 the surface 0 10 cm organic matter content is 4 4 the soil bulk density ranges from 1 24 1 44 g cm 3 within the top 60 cm of the soil layer 2 2 field measurement the water and energy fluxes and standard meteorological measurements were collected at the tea plantation site from 2014 to 2017 a sonic anemometer thermometer csat3 campbell scientific and an open path co2 h2o analyzer ec150 campbell scientific were used to measure the latent heat flux le and sensible heat flux h the path length of our anemometer and gas analyzer sensor was 10 cm and the anemometer head was orientated towards sw 225 the separation distance between the center of the anemometer and the gas analyzer sensor was 5 cm the open path analyzer was calibrated yearly during the study period using a dew point generator li 610 licor inc table 2 is a description of the instrumentation measurement frequency and height used to obtain the water and energy fluxes and meteorological data the detail description of the eddy covariance systems for the tea plantation site can be found in pang et al 2019 due to the lack of lai measurements from 2014 to 2017 the lai in this period was acquired from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod15a2h frequency 8 day spatial resolution 500 m data to estimate plant growth however the modis derived lai modis lai was inconsistent with the phenology of tea plantations this difference was mainly due to artificial disturbance e g pruning and weeding to tea plantations given the stable phenology of the tea plantation and cropping system in the study period we measured the leaf area index lai monthly using a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc in 2018 the seasonal variation in the lai in 2018 can be used as an approximation for 2014 2017 2 3 flux calculation the processing system of observed flux data for chinaflux developed by the matlab software package li et al 2008 was used to calculated the half hourly h and le according to the following procedures 1 removal of noise spikes yu et al 2006 2 planar fit

additional data quality control procedures are described in detail in pang et al 2019 2 4 parameter calculation the daily reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using the local meteorological

nonlinear regressions 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions the mean annual precipitation was 1475 8 mm during 2014 2017 which was higher than the long term average 1146 7 mm for 1981 2010 of liyang national meteorological station away 4 km from the measurement site this difference was mainly due to the higher precipitation in the rainy season 1126 8 mm vs 886 1 mm during the study years the average air temperature was 16 9 c which was approximately 1 1 c higher than the long term average the daily total precipitation p and air temperature ta soil temperature ts 10cm vpd and soil water content swc at three depths 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm are shown in fig 3 p showed strong seasonal variations fig 3d and more than 75 of p occurred in the rainy season tables 1 rain typically ceased during the dry season ta was also highly variable the highest and lowest ta values were 34 05 c on 06 august 2017 and 7 53 c on 24 january 2016 respectively during 2014 2017 ts 10 cm varied seasonally following ta daily vpd 1 kpa was observed in 49 days of 2014 72 days of 2015 58 days of 2016 and 67 days of 2017 and these days generally occurred in april october and corresponded to low p and high ta during this period during the rainy season the swc stayed at high values due to recharge from frequent rainfall in the dry season as the swc was consumed due to plant uptake the swc gradually declined however the swc reached an abnormal minimum 0 05 m3 m 3 in the rainy season of 2016 on doy 251 in 2016 fig 3c it was mainly due to the abnormal precipitation at mid growing season 2016 tables 1 although the total precipitation was high 599 2 mm the number of no precipitation events reached 66 and more than 97 precipitation concerned within 13 days at the period during doy 191 and 257 of 2016 the total precipitation was only 4 2 mm and the maximal daily precipitation was 1 2 mm and the number of days without precipitation reached 53 which led the low swc at the period 3 2 energy closure and footprint analysis during the study period all linear correlations had r 2 values higher than 0 88 and their slopes ranged between 0 63 and 0 66 table 4 the energy budget closure ratio ebr were 0 72 0 70 0 71 and 0 69 respectively during 2014 and 2017 they are within the range of 0 53 1 00 reported from the europe north america and china flux sites li et al 2005 wilson and baldocchi 2000 indicating that the ec measurement system provides reliable estimates of the surface energy balance components in tea plantation in our tea plantation site the average energy imbalance is 29 the imbalance was mainly due to measurement errors horizontal heat advection missing turbulent capture and canopy and soil heat storage pardo et al 2015 in our study canopy and soil heat storage were taken into consideration figs 1 showed the variation of daily mean canopy and soil heat storage in 2014 the canopy and soil heat storage comprised a small proportion of rn hence the energy imbalance may be attributed to horizontal heat advection or missing turbulent capture twine et al 2000 proposed the bowen ratio closure method for correcting eddy covariance h and le values following this method the half hourly energy fluxes were forced a closure in this study meanwhile the residual energy equally between le and h was adopted oliphant et al 2004 when the bowen ratio was close to 1 the footprint was also calculated to determine the source area of the energy fluxes at the tea plantation with the ec system the major variables that affect the size and extent of the source area are the effective measurement height surface roughness length wind speed and direction and atmospheric stability the flux footprint prediction model proposed by kljun et al 2015 was used to obtain the footprint of the flux measurements at different stages in this study figs 2 shows the wind frequency and the source area of the ec measurement based on the footprint analysis the results indicated that 80 of the flux source was obtained from an upwind distance of 80 m in april and june figs 2c d in other seasons the distance from the upwind direction with 80 of the flux source was approximately 50 m figs 2a b e h the difference in upwind distance was mainly due to the pruning of tea plantation fig 1e and the height of the tea trees was reduced to 23 75 cm in april and june table 1 this change may lead to a magnification of the effective measurement height considering the distance from ec site to the boundary of the tea plantation area was more than 150 m these measurements from the ec system indicate that the footprint was within the tea plantation area 3 3 diurnal and seasonal variations of energy fluxes fig 4 shows the diurnal cycles of ecosystem energy fluxes at the dormant period pruning period early growing season mid growing season and late growing season the corresponding values of ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd are also shown the average diurnal energy fluxes had similar variations with a peak value around noon except for soil heat flux g at the four seasons fig 4a d the average net radiation rn had an apparent seasonal variation declining from 115 6 at mid growing season to 49 9 w m 2 at the dormant period which was consistent with the decreasing solar elevation the diurnal variations of g were small at the four growth stages showing an s curve diurnal g reached the peak for 4 5 hours after rn reached the peak at the pruning period and mid growing season the soil was an energy sink g 0 in contrast the soil changed to be a heat source at the late growing season and dormant period the average diurnal dynamics of le and h were consistent with rn peaking between 12 00 and 13 00 and decreasing until between 19 00 and 20 00 the mean le was largest at the mid growing season 81 3 w m 2 accounting for 70 3 of rn it was smallest 29 7 w m 2 at the dormant period and the ratio of le rn was 59 5 meanwhile the h was largest 40 2 w m 2 at the pruning period and the smallest h 15 4 w m 2 was at the late growing season at the dormant and pruning period the peak values of h excessed le fig 4a b it seemed that the low temperature dormancy at the dormant period and the loss of tea branches and leaves at the pruning period limited le fig 5 shows the seasonal variation in the daily values of rn g le h and bowen ratio β during the 4 year study period 2014 2017 the daily rn ranged from 16 1 223 0 w m 2 with average of 81 6 w m 2 and generally reached the maximum in july during 2014 2017 g also had a seasonal trend which was in accordance with the variation in rn fig 5a from mid march through most of the rainy season the soil was an energy sink g 0 the maximum daily average g less than 21 w m 2 generally occurred at the mid growing season and the ratio of g rn was less than 6 during this period table 5 in the dry season g changed direction and was an important component of energy distribution accounting for approximately 6 10 of rn however at the annual scale g rn was less than 1 8 in the study period le exhibited distinct seasonal patterns which are related to radiation conditions and plant phenology from january the daily le gradually increased reaching the peak in july 146 6 194 9 w m 2 for both years with the full canopy and suitable hydrothermal conditions and then in late august starting to taper off fig 5a le was the main consumer of rn le rn 0 50 0 96 table 5 at the four seasons during the study period at the mid growing season and late growing season le accounted for more than 0 75 of rn except for the mid growing season in 2016 due to the prolonged drought table 5 it was consistent with the previous studies in subtropical forests song et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 le was comprised of more than 0 70 of rn over many evergreen broadleaf forests growing season in subtropical and tropical region cristiano et al 2015 fisher et al 2008 hirano et al 2014 yan et al 2017 there was an almost opposite trend to le in the seasonal variations of h and β h and β were much higher at the pruning and dormant period than the mid growing and late growing seasons fig 5 and table 5 the seasonal h rn β was generally less than 0 25 0 36 at mid growing and late growing seasons while h rn varied from 0 27 to 0 49 and β varied from 0 41 to 0 90 at dormant and pruning period the reverse seasonal changes were mainly due to the tea plantation growth status buttar et al 2018 lv et al 2012 the pruning of canopy at the pruning period and physiological dormancy at the dormant period might limit le for example with intense pruning interference in the tea plantation the lai reached a low level 0 8 and 0 9 m2 m 2 table 1 in april and may respectively at pruning period which caused a decrease in means of water transport and might limit the partitioning of energy into le in this study at pruning period the values of h and β were high fig 5 before new leaves sprouted we compared the differences between before and after pruning of tea plantation table 6 after pruning of tea plantation le decreased 32 35 meanwhile β had a big increase lv et al 2012 also reported daily mean et rates could decrease 36 7 48 3 after pruning in a subtropical tea plantation using the static chamber infrared gas analyzer irga as the new leaves sprouted from the tea trees in late may h and β gradually declined fig 5 moreover there was an asymptotic relationship between le and ta when ta was less than 10 c fig 6 squire 1979 squire and callander 1981 wang et al 2011 reported that tea trees entered physiological dormancy at low ta generally less than 10 13 c in subtropical areas with the lower ta average 7 2 c at the dormant period tea trees past into physiological dormancy at our site which might weaken photosynthesis and leaf level stomatal conductance and limit le 3 4 factors influencing tea plantation evapotranspiration and energy fluxes 3 4 1 seasonal variations of evapotranspiration fig 7 showed the seasonal variations of daily eta and eto during 2014 2017 at the tea plantation site the daily eta gradually increased from january reaching the peak value between 5 2 and 6 9 mm day 1 in july for both years and decreasing thereafter the seasonal variation of daily eta was similar to that of eto for daily data pearson correlation coefficient 0 88 0 91 0 85 and 0 88 from 2014 to 2017 respectively the highest monthly values of eta were in july or august about 100 5 131 5 mm fig 8 which was also closed to the highest monthly eto 106 5 140 0 mm during the study period the monthly eta also varied closely with the eto for monthly data pearson correlation coefficient 0 88 0 95 0 88 and 0 93 from 2014 to 2017 respectively as the rain fed crop the good relationships between eta and eto might be attributed to the well precipitation conditions as a result of this the monthly values of eta eto at the mid growing season and late growing season maintained above 0 90 except for the august and september in 2016 fig 8 and the maximum value of eta eto can be up to 1 36 however there were also differences between eta and eto fig 7 8 generally the differences were highest at the pruning period than other seasons that was mainly because the pruning of canopy limited the eta while the higher rn led to the higher estimates of eto at the period fig 7 8 for example the large differences between eta and eto during the pruning period in 2017 were observed fig 8d due to the higher rn daily average 118 86 w m 2 than other years there was higher eto 309 6 mm at the pruning period of 2017 although the total precipitation was large 318 4 mm table 1 and swc was also high average 0 15 m3 m 3 approaching the field capacity 0 17 m3 m 3 at the period the pruning of canopy limited eta 189 2 mm leading the larger differences between eta and eto the monthly value of eta eto also reached the lowest in may 2017 0 50 fig 8d during the study period the differences between eta and eto during the mid growing season 2016 were also larger than those during mid growing seasons other years fig 8c however that was mainly due to the extreme drought at the period although the total precipitation amount was large 599 2 mm at the mid growing season 2016 the precipitation distributions were uneven table 1 the numbers of days without precipitation were 66 at mid growing season 2016 and led the low swc at the period which limited eta however the eto was higher due to the higher energy conditions 3 4 2 meteorological and biophysical controls on evapotranspiration rn was the main limiting factor on the eta of tea plantation during 2014 2017 because the rn determined the temporal variation in le by 80 82 82 and 70 r 2 respectively in 2014 2017 on a daily basis figs 3a d fisher et al 2008 reported that rn was the critical driving factor of et based on 21 forest eddy covariance sites meanwhile there were significant asymptotic relationships between le and vpd with r 2 0 48 for 2014 0 54 for 2015 0 53 for 2016 and 0 53 for 2017 at p 0 001 figs 3e h the daily le increased with increasing vpd approaching the maximum values at around 1 5 kpa it was similar with the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests and tree plantations cristiano et al 2015 gu et al 2006 rosado et al 2012 furthermore the relationship between et and soil water deficit swd indicated that the effect of soil water on eta was weak in the study period with exception of a few days at the growing season because of the low soil water availability figs 3j l these results suggested that the rn acted as a primary driver of evapotranspiration in the tea plantation crop growth status also have significant impacts on et yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 2016 to explore the relative importance of meteorological and biological controls on eta for tea plantations the seasonal behaviors of α gc and ω were also investigated fig 9 at the mid growing and late growing seasons the monthly values of eta eto were closed to 1 0 except for august and september 2016 meanwhile the α values were also high average 1 05 at the period indicating the available energy rather than water supply controlled the tea plantation eta in addition at the tea plantation site α values were closely related to gc values fig 9 the α values increased with increasing gc when gc 10 mm s 1 when gc was more than 10 mm s 1 α was insensitive to gc in our tea plantation site fig 10 the theoretical study on different ecosystems indicated that et was insensitive to canopy conductance when gc 10 16 mm s 1 lei and yang 2010 yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the larger gc at the mid growing and late growing seasons average 10 6 mm s 1 at our site implied a low sensitivity of eta to vegetation physiological control thus environmental control rn or vpd had a significant impact on eta in addition the ω of this period was mostly greater than 0 60 and the average value of ω reached 0 69 which indicated that rn contributed more to eta at the mid growing and late growing seasons however at the pruning and dormant period the monthly values of eta eto were relatively low average 0 76 meanwhile the average α values were less than 1 0 at the period fig 9a further analysis showed that the relationship between swc and α was not obvious fig 11 a b that results were mainly due to low gc values average 8 17 and 8 62 mm s 1 for the pruning and dormant period respectively with vegetation physiological control gc had been reported as a biophysical indicator of et and was influenced by changes in lai and leaf level stomatal conductance hirano et al 2014 igarashi et al 2015 we analysed the relationship between monthly lai values and mid day mean gc values at growing season including pruning period mid growing and late growing seasons fig 12 a overall as the lai increased gc showed an increasing trend suggesting that gc was influenced by tea plantation growth the significant loss of tea branches and leaves due to pruning of canopy led low lai and gc values at the pruning period our result also showed that gc decreased 33 65 after pruning of tea plantation while gc gradually increased with the new leaves sprouting however at the dormant period the lai values were high but the gc values were still low fig 12a meanwhile the relationship between gc and swc with the three groups according to vpd from 2014 to 2017 fig 11e suggested that gc was insensitive to swc in addition pang et al 2019 observed lower photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd and gross primary productivity gpp at our tea plantation site for the dormant period indicating that photosynthetic capacity of tea trees was weak we speculated that tea trees pass into physiological dormancy due to the low ta and the low temperature stress decreased photosynthetic capacity and leaf stomata conductance previous studies also reported that low temperature stress would inhibit evidently photosynthetic capacity and leaf stomata conductance farquhar and sharkey 1981 grantz 1989 strand et al 2002 further analysis showed that the ω average 0 39 was less than 0 5 at the dormant period which indicated that eta might be affected by gc and vpd coupling the relationship between gc and vpd at the period shows that gc decreased with the increase in vpd in a logarithmic pattern fig 12b r 2 0 22 p 0 001 li et al 2010 wever et al 2002 reported that gc was strongly affected by the vpd after the lai reached a high level with ample water similar trends occurred at our site therefore eta was affected by the physiological dormancy and vpd through coupling gc at the dormant period 3 4 3 impacts of extreme climate on evapotranspiration and energy fluxes in our study area both large interannual variation in precipitation cv 23 9 during 2014 2017 and drought at mid growing season occurred during 2015 and 2017 which provided us a valuable chance to investigate the impacts of climate and drought on et compared with historical climate records from 1956 to 2016 2014 and 2017 were near normal years and 2015 and 2016 were considered wet and extremely wet years respectively the observed annual eta values at the tea plantation were 694 732 741 and 732 mm in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 the plentiful rainfall in 2016 1937 mm did not significantly increase the eta compared with 2014 1335 mm 2015 1532 mm and 2017 1103 mm at the tea plantation meanwhile the interannual variation in gpp in our tea plantation site was also small pang et al 2019 hence water demand for tea plantation growth was also enough in the normal years there were significant differences in energy partitioning at mid growing season among 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 the le h at this period was 79 20 13 17 87 80 23 22 88 19 31 93 and 93 14 22 30 w m 2 respectively during 2014 2017 table 5 β showed obvious differences among the study years fig 13 with soil moisture decreasing β and swc had a curvilinear relationship at this period especially when swc was below 0 12 m3 m 3 β significantly increased among 2015 2016 and 2017 a similar trend was documented in the summer extreme drought events in the grass ecosystems by jongen et al 2011 rajan et al 2014 especially for the mid growing season 2016 β reached as high as 2 63 with the prolonged drought the results were mainly due to lack of water supply combined with high vpd average 1 03 kpa leading to a significant reduction in gc 8 16 mm s 1 in 2016 vs 14 1 mm s 1 in 2014 9 5 mm s 1 in 2015 and 10 9 mm s 1 in 2017 and limiting le at the mid growing season meanwhile ω average 0 47 was less than 0 5 which suggested that sensitivity of et to vegetation physiological control was also high at mid growing season 2016 fig 8 the results also indicated that soil water availability strongly affected et and energy partitioning at the mid growing season for tea plantation the relationship between swc and biometeorological factors was analyzed fig 11 at the mid growing season α and gc was sensitive to swc fig 11c g especially when vpd increased gc continued to decrease with water stress fig 11g and asymptotic relationships between gc and swc were also found gc had substantial reduction with swc below 0 12 m3 m 3 fig 11c g the results suggested that eta would be significantly affected by swc at the period due to the large water demand for growth average eta 3 09 mm day 1 when the soil water was below 0 12 m3 m 3 moreover in august and september 2016 the values of eta eto dipped to 0 67 and 0 77 respectively hence when the prolonged drought occurs at the mid growing season the irrigations would be needed however the water demand was not substantial in other seasons and α and gc was insensitive to swc with global climate warming the frequency of drought and heavy precipitation events has greatly increased fowler and hennessy 1995 roshan et al 2013 especially at the rainy season the amounts of total precipitation are large but the precipitation distributions are becoming uneven and the extremely drought events are also increasing in subtropical area china liu et al 2005 ma et al 2015 as the rain fed crop the irrigation schedule for tea plantations in our study area are lacking future studies of transpiration soil water redistribution and root system at our site are needed to improve the understanding of the eta controlling mechanisms and help develop the appropriate irrigation schedule 3 5 inter annual variation in energy flux and evapotranspiration the cumulative annual eta and eto for 2014 2017 is shown in table 7 the annual eta of tea plantation was 725 21 mm eta accounted for 49 of the annual precipitation p 1477 353 mm during the study period which was within the range 45 70 for subtropical forests bossard et al 2015 xiao et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in 2014 with normal precipitation eta accounted for 52 of precipitation with less precipitation in 2017 eta accounted for 66 of precipitation in contrast under the wet conditions in 2015 and 2016 eta accounted for 48 and 38 respectively although the interannual variation in precipitation was large coefficient of variance cv 23 9 the variation in eta is small cv 2 9 at the tea plantation site which was also consistent with the previous studies that forests et had a small interannual variation compared with annual precipitation song et al 2017 yan et al 2017 meanwhile the inter seasonal differences of eta were also small with coefficient of variance cv 9 7 the average seasonal eta was 130 9 10 1 208 9 15 6 284 3 19 2 and 100 5 9 7 mm at the dormant period pruning period mid growing season and late growing season respectively during the study period comparing the annual eta and eto the annual actual evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 was slightly less than the annual reference evapotranspiration table 7 however the differences between annual eta and eto were large in 2016 and 2017 the annual eto varied closely with the rn in the tea plantation site pearson correlation coefficient 0 99 the higher rn and ta in 2016 and 2017 led to the higher eto however there was no corresponding increasing in the annual eta that was mainly due to the higher rn occurring in the prolonged drought period in 2016 august and september 2016 and the pruning period in 2017 table 5 during the period eta was significantly affected by the water availability and pruning of canopy respectively which led the large differences between eta and eto in 2016 and 2017 4 summary and conclusion the study investigated four years of successive in situ observation of et and energy fluxes for a tea plantation using the eddy covariance technique the average energy imbalance was about 29 at the tea plantation site thus the corrected le and h data were obtained by forcing the energy closure following to twine et al 2000 and oliphant et al 2004 the seasonal variation of le rn was strongly related to tea plantation phenology with values of 0 69 0 96 for mid growing and late growing seasons and 0 50 0 67 for the pruning and dormant period which are consistent with the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests the inter annual eta showed less temporal variation ranging from 694 741 mm cv 2 9 daily eta had distinct seasonal patterns with the peak values 5 2 6 9 mm day 1 in july daily high correlation between rn and eta suggested that the available energy acted as a primary driver of evapotranspiration in the tea plantation in addition low temperature physiological dormancy vpd and lai also played secondary impacts on eta through their eﬀ ects on canopy surface conductance 10 mm s 1 the highest differences between eta and eto were observed at the pruning period although the water supply was sufficient implying that current pruning practice in april weakened the evapotranspiration capacity of tea plantation moreover our study also found the extreme drought at the mid growing season significantly influenced the energy partitioning and eta would be affected by soil water availability with a swc threshold about 0 12 m3 m 3 at the period with the above analysis a more detailed perspective has been obtained on the dynamics of et and energy fluxes and its meteorological and biophysical controls over the tea plantation these results will be useful for efficient managements of water and simulating land surface water and heat processes over

10496,tea plantations camellia sinensis are expanding rapidly in china during the last two decades however the detailed knowledges of water vapor and energy fluxes in tea plantation ecosystem are still absent in this study we explored the temporal variation in water vapor and energy fluxes over a tea plantation through the analysis of 4 year 2014 2017 fluxes data obtained via the eddy covariance technique the results showed that latent heat flux le was the main consumer of net radiation rn le rn ranged from 0 50 to 0 67 at the pruning period april june and dormant period december march at the mid growing season july september and late growing season october november le accounted for more than 0 75 of rn except for the mid growing season in 2016 sensible heat flux h showed an almost opposite trend to le while seasonal variation of soil heat flux g was small the interannual actual evapotranspiration eta was stable in tea plantation ranging from 694 741 mm cv 2 9 despite a large interannual variation in precipitation cv 23 9 the average annual eta accounted for 49 of the corresponding annual precipitation the highest measured daily eta reached 5 2 6 9 mm in july for both years the seasonal variations of daily eta were strongly related to the rn at the mid growing and late growing seasons rn was the limiting factor on eta with high priestley taylor coefficient α 1 05 and decoupling coefficient ω 0 69 in addition low temperature physiological dormancy and vapor pressure deficit vpd at the dormant period and pruning of canopy at the pruning period leading low leaf area index lai also played secondary impacts on eta through their eﬀ ects on canopy surface conductance 10 mm s 1 moreover eta would be significantly affected by soil water availability at the mid growing season due to the large water demand for growth when the soil water was below 0 12 m3 m 3 keywords eddy covariance evapotranspiration energy exchange tea plantation taihu lake basin 1 introduction tea plantations camellia sinensis are distributed worldwide with a total area of 21 1 million ha in 2016 and they are mainly located in subtropical and tropical regions fao 2017 due to considerable economic benefits tea plantations have expanded continuously su et al 2016 in china the area of tea plantation expanded by a factor of 3 during 2001 2016 reaching 3 02 million ha in 2016 nbsc 2018 many local forests e g bamboo forests and mingled forests were cleared and converted to tea plantations fan and han 2020 wang et al 2020 tea plantation has been the major cash crop except for rice and wheat in the hilly areas of southeast china su et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however tea plantations expansion is accompanied with the changes in albedo leaf area and different water use strategies compared to the local ecosystems which would influence the regional water and energy budgets pongratz et al 2006 taylor et al 2002 wang et al 2006 evapotranspiration et plays the critical role in linking the water and energy cycles bossard et al 2015 moiwo and tao 2014 wever et al 2002 hence accurate assessment of et and energy fluxes over tea plantation is essential for better understanding regional climate change water balance and efficient water management although several studies have focused on the et of tea plantations most of them used the bowen ratio energy balance method buttar et al 2018 or lysimeters sikka et al 2009 to our knowledge few studies have quantified et in tea plantation with the eddy covariance ec technique meanwhile previous studies were mainly short term studies lasting less than a year or several days which suggested that irradiance levels were the significant controlling factors on the energy partitioning at the diurnal cycle in tea plantation ecosystems kairu 1993 kigalu 2007 squire 1979 these studies offered partial insights into the dynamics of energy fluxes and et for tea plantation the detailed knowledges about the seasonal and inter annual dynamics in et and energy partitioning over tea plantation ecosystem are lacking in addition the temporal variability of et and energy partitioning are always influenced by interacting meteorological factors vegetation phenology and soil water conditions li et al 2010 ryu et al 2008 yan et al 2017 the control factors on et and energy partitioning in tea plantation ecosystem are also not well understood moreover extreme climate events e g drought and heavy rainfall and the widely applied strong pruning in tree plantations were reported to significantly shift the patterns of energy partitioning lv et al 2012 ma et al 2019 rajan et al 2014 whereas these influences on the et and energy partitioning in tea plantations were also few assessed therefore more knowledge on et and energy partitioning over tea plantation ecosystem are needed based on the long term and high frequency flux measurements taihu lake basin is the key ecological functional area in china with a typical subtropical monsoon climate fig 1 b in the past 15 years agricultural development has intensified especially in the hilly area in the western part of the basin the tianmu lake catchment is one such area in the western taihu lake basin fig 1c which is the typical agricultural development catchment where tea plantations have increased approximately fivefold from 2001 to 2016 reaching up to 2980 ha in 2016 accounting for 12 2 of the catchment area tea plantation expansion in the hilly areas of taihu lake basin would affect regional water and energy balances although the details have not been adequately studied hence it is urgent to understand the processes that control the tea plantation ecosystem energy and water cycles in the region a flux measurement station was established in 2014 aiming at the long term monitoring of tea plantations in the tianmu lake catchment fig 1d e and high frequency energy water and carbon fluxes were obtained over 4 consecutive years the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration eta and investigate its seasonal and interannual variation in tea plantation 2 examine the major meteorological and biophysical controls on eta 3 investigate the influences of tea trees pruning and extreme climate events on eta and energy partitioning for tea plantation ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the measurement site 31 16 14 n 119 27 15 e 103 m altitude with a total area of approximately 30 ha is located at a tea plantation camellia sinensis in the tianmu lake catchment fig 1c the measurement site is located at a hillslope soil slope 5 the vegetation at the site is dominated by tea plantation the tea plantation in our study site is clonal propagation and planted in 2010 with a plant density of 41 250 plants ha and an inter row spacing of 1 5 m the row orientation is east west there are sparse zelkova serrata makino planted in 2013 between the ridges the tea plantation is under the rain fed cultivation and the annual average yield of tea leaves is 450 560 kg ha 1 in our study area the climate of the study region is subtropical monsoon climate with significant seasonality the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 15 8 c and 1146 7 mm the standard monthly data of liyang national meteorological station from 1981 to 2010 respectively the daily air temperature ranged from 3 1 c in january to 28 4 c in july the minimum and maximum annual rainfall were 820 6 1997 and 2159 4 mm 2016 respectively there is a rainy season from april to september and dry season from october to march throughout the year in the rainy season 75 860 mm of annual precipitation occurred during this period the dry season with little precipitation can be divided into a hot dry season october november and a cold dry season december march in the hot dry season the mean temperature was 14 6 c in the cool dry season the mean temperature was low 4 6 c and that was also the dormant period of tea plantations fig 2 shows the general schedule of phenology and management in the study tea plantation in early april farmers began to pick the leaves of tea trees and then pruned the canopy of tea trees april through november is the period of tea plantations growth and contains the phenological events of leaf bud flower bud and flowering following the crop season the canopy height varies from 23 cm april to 115 cm november table 1 crown width of tea plantations have similar seasonal change trend with canopy height which decreased sharply in april due to pruning of tea trees then gradually increased during the growing season and stabilized in october the pattern of ridge spacing is contrary to the two variables the leaf area index lai was closely related to the phenology of the dominant tea plantation with a peak value of 4 6 m2 m 2 in november the ground is covered by pruned branches and tea tree leaves some weeds are growing between the ridges such as setaria viridis l p beauv and digitaria sanguinalis l scop the soil type is a shallow lithosol according to fao classification with soil layer thickness 60 cm and average gravel content 30 the bedrock was sandstone with a large permeability to water liao et al 2016 the soil texture is silt loam according to the usda classification with clay and silt contents approximately 22 0 24 8 and 54 0 54 9 respectively the soils have good infiltration characteristics according to the study of zhu et al 2014 the surface 0 10 cm organic matter content is 4 4 the soil bulk density ranges from 1 24 1 44 g cm 3 within the top 60 cm of the soil layer 2 2 field measurement the water and energy fluxes and standard meteorological measurements were collected at the tea plantation site from 2014 to 2017 a sonic anemometer thermometer csat3 campbell scientific and an open path co2 h2o analyzer ec150 campbell scientific were used to measure the latent heat flux le and sensible heat flux h the path length of our anemometer and gas analyzer sensor was 10 cm and the anemometer head was orientated towards sw 225 the separation distance between the center of the anemometer and the gas analyzer sensor was 5 cm the open path analyzer was calibrated yearly during the study period using a dew point generator li 610 licor inc table 2 is a description of the instrumentation measurement frequency and height used to obtain the water and energy fluxes and meteorological data the detail description of the eddy covariance systems for the tea plantation site can be found in pang et al 2019 due to the lack of lai measurements from 2014 to 2017 the lai in this period was acquired from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod15a2h frequency 8 day spatial resolution 500 m data to estimate plant growth however the modis derived lai modis lai was inconsistent with the phenology of tea plantations this difference was mainly due to artificial disturbance e g pruning and weeding to tea plantations given the stable phenology of the tea plantation and cropping system in the study period we measured the leaf area index lai monthly using a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc in 2018 the seasonal variation in the lai in 2018 can be used as an approximation for 2014 2017 2 3 flux calculation the processing system of observed flux data for chinaflux developed by the matlab software package li et al 2008 was used to calculated the half hourly h and le according to the following procedures 1 removal of noise spikes yu et al 2006 2 planar fit

shorter than 2 h empirical relationships look up tables was used to fill the missing data and the mean diurnal variation mdv method falge et al 2001 was used to fill the gaps between 2 h and 7 days additional data quality control procedures are described in detail in pang et al 2019 2 4 parameter calculation the daily reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using the local meteorological

nonlinear regressions 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions the mean annual precipitation was 1475 8 mm during 2014 2017 which was higher than the long term average 1146 7 mm for 1981 2010 of liyang national meteorological station away 4 km from the measurement site this difference was mainly due to the higher precipitation in the rainy season 1126 8 mm vs 886 1 mm during the study years the average air temperature was 16 9 c which was approximately 1 1 c higher than the long term average the daily total precipitation p and air temperature ta soil temperature ts 10cm vpd and soil water content swc at three depths 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm are shown in fig 3 p showed strong seasonal variations fig 3d and more than 75 of p occurred in the rainy season tables 1 rain typically ceased during the dry season ta was also highly variable the highest and lowest ta values were 34 05 c on 06 august 2017 and 7 53 c on 24 january 2016 respectively during 2014 2017 ts 10 cm varied seasonally following ta daily vpd 1 kpa was observed in 49 days of 2014 72 days of 2015 58 days of 2016 and 67 days of 2017 and these days generally occurred in april october and corresponded to low p and high ta during this period during the rainy season the swc stayed at high values due to recharge from frequent rainfall in the dry season as the swc was consumed due to plant uptake the swc gradually declined however the swc reached an abnormal minimum 0 05 m3 m 3 in the rainy season of 2016 on doy 251 in 2016 fig 3c it was mainly due to the abnormal precipitation at mid growing season 2016 tables 1 although the total precipitation was high 599 2 mm the number of no precipitation events reached 66 and more than 97 precipitation concerned within 13 days at the period during doy 191 and 257 of 2016 the total precipitation was only 4 2 mm and the maximal daily precipitation was 1 2 mm and the number of days without precipitation reached 53 which led the low swc at the period 3 2 energy closure and footprint analysis during the study period all linear correlations had r 2 values higher than 0 88 and their slopes ranged between 0 63 and 0 66 table 4 the energy budget closure ratio ebr were 0 72 0 70 0 71 and 0 69 respectively during 2014 and 2017 they are within the range of 0 53 1 00 reported from the europe north america and china flux sites li et al 2005 wilson and baldocchi 2000 indicating that the ec measurement system provides reliable estimates of the surface energy balance components in tea plantation in our tea plantation site the average energy imbalance is 29 the imbalance was mainly due to measurement errors horizontal heat advection missing turbulent capture and canopy and soil heat storage pardo et al 2015 in our study canopy and soil heat storage were taken into consideration figs 1 showed the variation of daily mean canopy and soil heat storage in 2014 the canopy and soil heat storage comprised a small proportion of rn hence the energy imbalance may be attributed to horizontal heat advection or missing turbulent capture twine et al 2000 proposed the bowen ratio closure method for correcting eddy covariance h and le values following this method the half hourly energy fluxes were forced a closure in this study meanwhile the residual energy equally between le and h was adopted oliphant et al 2004 when the bowen ratio was close to 1 the footprint was also calculated to determine the source area of the energy fluxes at the tea plantation with the ec system the major variables that affect the size and extent of the source area are the effective measurement height surface roughness length wind speed and direction and atmospheric stability the flux footprint prediction model proposed by kljun et al 2015 was used to obtain the footprint of the flux measurements at different stages in this study figs 2 shows the wind frequency and the source area of the ec measurement based on the footprint analysis the results indicated that 80 of the flux source was obtained from an upwind distance of 80 m in april and june figs 2c d in other seasons the distance from the upwind direction with 80 of the flux source was approximately 50 m figs 2a b e h the difference in upwind distance was mainly due to the pruning of tea plantation fig 1e and the height of the tea trees was reduced to 23 75 cm in april and june table 1 this change may lead to a magnification of the effective measurement height considering the distance from ec site to the boundary of the tea plantation area was more than 150 m these measurements from the ec system indicate that the footprint was within the tea plantation area 3 3 diurnal and seasonal variations of energy fluxes fig 4 shows the diurnal cycles of ecosystem energy fluxes at the dormant period pruning period early growing season mid growing season and late growing season the corresponding values of ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd are also shown the average diurnal energy fluxes had similar variations with a peak value around noon except for soil heat flux g at the four seasons fig 4a d the average net radiation rn had an apparent seasonal variation declining from 115 6 at mid growing season to 49 9 w m 2 at the dormant period which was consistent with the decreasing solar elevation the diurnal variations of g were small at the four growth stages showing an s curve diurnal g reached the peak for 4 5 hours after rn reached the peak at the pruning period and mid growing season the soil was an energy sink g 0 in contrast the soil changed to be a heat source at the late growing season and dormant period the average diurnal dynamics of le and h were consistent with rn peaking between 12 00 and 13 00 and decreasing until between 19 00 and 20 00 the mean le was largest at the mid growing season 81 3 w m 2 accounting for 70 3 of rn it was smallest 29 7 w m 2 at the dormant period and the ratio of le rn was 59 5 meanwhile the h was largest 40 2 w m 2 at the pruning period and the smallest h 15 4 w m 2 was at the late growing season at the dormant and pruning period the peak values of h excessed le fig 4a b it seemed that the low temperature dormancy at the dormant period and the loss of tea branches and leaves at the pruning period limited le fig 5 shows the seasonal variation in the daily values of rn g le h and bowen ratio β during the 4 year study period 2014 2017 the daily rn ranged from 16 1 223 0 w m 2 with average of 81 6 w m 2 and generally reached the maximum in july during 2014 2017 g also had a seasonal trend which was in accordance with the variation in rn fig 5a from mid march through most of the rainy season the soil was an energy sink g 0 the maximum daily average g less than 21 w m 2 generally occurred at the mid growing season and the ratio of g rn was less than 6 during this period table 5 in the dry season g changed direction and was an important component of energy distribution accounting for approximately 6 10 of rn however at the annual scale g rn was less than 1 8 in the study period le exhibited distinct seasonal patterns which are related to radiation conditions and plant phenology from january the daily le gradually increased reaching the peak in july 146 6 194 9 w m 2 for both years with the full canopy and suitable hydrothermal conditions and then in late august starting to taper off fig 5a le was the main consumer of rn le rn 0 50 0 96 table 5 at the four seasons during the study period at the mid growing season and late growing season le accounted for more than 0 75 of rn except for the mid growing season in 2016 due to the prolonged drought table 5 it was consistent with the previous studies in subtropical forests song et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 le was comprised of more than 0 70 of rn over many evergreen broadleaf forests growing season in subtropical and tropical region cristiano et al 2015 fisher et al 2008 hirano et al 2014 yan et al 2017 there was an almost opposite trend to le in the seasonal variations of h and β h and β were much higher at the pruning and dormant period than the mid growing and late growing seasons fig 5 and table 5 the seasonal h rn β was generally less than 0 25 0 36 at mid growing and late growing seasons while h rn varied from 0 27 to 0 49 and β varied from 0 41 to 0 90 at dormant and pruning period the reverse seasonal changes were mainly due to the tea plantation growth status buttar et al 2018 lv et al 2012 the pruning of canopy at the pruning period and physiological dormancy at the dormant period might limit le for example with intense pruning interference in the tea plantation the lai reached a low level 0 8 and 0 9 m2 m 2 table 1 in april and may respectively at pruning period which caused a decrease in means of water transport and might limit the partitioning of energy into le in this study at pruning period the values of h and β were high fig 5 before new leaves sprouted we compared the differences between before and after pruning of tea plantation table 6 after pruning of tea plantation le decreased 32 35 meanwhile β had a big increase lv et al 2012 also reported daily mean et rates could decrease 36 7 48 3 after pruning in a subtropical tea plantation using the static chamber infrared gas analyzer irga as the new leaves sprouted from the tea trees in late may h and β gradually declined fig 5 moreover there was an asymptotic relationship between le and ta when ta was less than 10 c fig 6 squire 1979 squire and callander 1981 wang et al 2011 reported that tea trees entered physiological dormancy at low ta generally less than 10 13 c in subtropical areas with the lower ta average 7 2 c at the dormant period tea trees past into physiological dormancy at our site which might weaken photosynthesis and leaf level stomatal conductance and limit le 3 4 factors influencing tea plantation evapotranspiration and energy fluxes 3 4 1 seasonal variations of evapotranspiration fig 7 showed the seasonal variations of daily eta and eto during 2014 2017 at the tea plantation site the daily eta gradually increased from january reaching the peak value between 5 2 and 6 9 mm day 1 in july for both years and decreasing thereafter the seasonal variation of daily eta was similar to that of eto for daily data pearson correlation coefficient 0 88 0 91 0 85 and 0 88 from 2014 to 2017 respectively the highest monthly values of eta were in july or august about 100 5 131 5 mm fig 8 which was also closed to the highest monthly eto 106 5 140 0 mm during the study period the monthly eta also varied closely with the eto for monthly data pearson correlation coefficient 0 88 0 95 0 88 and 0 93 from 2014 to 2017 respectively as the rain fed crop the good relationships between eta and eto might be attributed to the well precipitation conditions as a result of this the monthly values of eta eto at the mid growing season and late growing season maintained above 0 90 except for the august and september in 2016 fig 8 and the maximum value of eta eto can be up to 1 36 however there were also differences between eta and eto fig 7 8 generally the differences were highest at the pruning period than other seasons that was mainly because the pruning of canopy limited the eta while the higher rn led to the higher estimates of eto at the period fig 7 8 for example the large differences between eta and eto during the pruning period in 2017 were observed fig 8d due to the higher rn daily average 118 86 w m 2 than other years there was higher eto 309 6 mm at the pruning period of 2017 although the total precipitation was large 318 4 mm table 1 and swc was also high average 0 15 m3 m 3 approaching the field capacity 0 17 m3 m 3 at the period the pruning of canopy limited eta 189 2 mm leading the larger differences between eta and eto the monthly value of eta eto also reached the lowest in may 2017 0 50 fig 8d during the study period the differences between eta and eto during the mid growing season 2016 were also larger than those during mid growing seasons other years fig 8c however that was mainly due to the extreme drought at the period although the total precipitation amount was large 599 2 mm at the mid growing season 2016 the precipitation distributions were uneven table 1 the numbers of days without precipitation were 66 at mid growing season 2016 and led the low swc at the period which limited eta however the eto was higher due to the higher energy conditions 3 4 2 meteorological and biophysical controls on evapotranspiration rn was the main limiting factor on the eta of tea plantation during 2014 2017 because the rn determined the temporal variation in le by 80 82 82 and 70 r 2 respectively in 2014 2017 on a daily basis figs 3a d fisher et al 2008 reported that rn was the critical driving factor of et based on 21 forest eddy covariance sites meanwhile there were significant asymptotic relationships between le and vpd with r 2 0 48 for 2014 0 54 for 2015 0 53 for 2016 and 0 53 for 2017 at p 0 001 figs 3e h the daily le increased with increasing vpd approaching the maximum values at around 1 5 kpa it was similar with the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests and tree plantations cristiano et al 2015 gu et al 2006 rosado et al 2012 furthermore the relationship between et and soil water deficit swd indicated that the effect of soil water on eta was weak in the study period with exception of a few days at the growing season because of the low soil water availability figs 3j l these results suggested that the rn acted as a primary driver of evapotranspiration in the tea plantation crop growth status also have significant impacts on et yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 2016 to explore the relative importance of meteorological and biological controls on eta for tea plantations the seasonal behaviors of α gc and ω were also investigated fig 9 at the mid growing and late growing seasons the monthly values of eta eto were closed to 1 0 except for august and september 2016 meanwhile the α values were also high average 1 05 at the period indicating the available energy rather than water supply controlled the tea plantation eta in addition at the tea plantation site α values were closely related to gc values fig 9 the α values increased with increasing gc when gc 10 mm s 1 when gc was more than 10 mm s 1 α was insensitive to gc in our tea plantation site fig 10 the theoretical study on different ecosystems indicated that et was insensitive to canopy conductance when gc 10 16 mm s 1 lei and yang 2010 yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the larger gc at the mid growing and late growing seasons average 10 6 mm s 1 at our site implied a low sensitivity of eta to vegetation physiological control thus environmental control rn or vpd had a significant impact on eta in addition the ω of this period was mostly greater than 0 60 and the average value of ω reached 0 69 which indicated that rn contributed more to eta at the mid growing and late growing seasons however at the pruning and dormant period the monthly values of eta eto were relatively low average 0 76 meanwhile the average α values were less than 1 0 at the period fig 9a further analysis showed that the relationship between swc and α was not obvious fig 11 a b that results were mainly due to low gc values average 8 17 and 8 62 mm s 1 for the pruning and dormant period respectively with vegetation physiological control gc had been reported as a biophysical indicator of et and was influenced by changes in lai and leaf level stomatal conductance hirano et al 2014 igarashi et al 2015 we analysed the relationship between monthly lai values and mid day mean gc values at growing season including pruning period mid growing and late growing seasons fig 12 a overall as the lai increased gc showed an increasing trend suggesting that gc was influenced by tea plantation growth the significant loss of tea branches and leaves due to pruning of canopy led low lai and gc values at the pruning period our result also showed that gc decreased 33 65 after pruning of tea plantation while gc gradually increased with the new leaves sprouting however at the dormant period the lai values were high but the gc values were still low fig 12a meanwhile the relationship between gc and swc with the three groups according to vpd from 2014 to 2017 fig 11e suggested that gc was insensitive to swc in addition pang et al 2019 observed lower photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd and gross primary productivity gpp at our tea plantation site for the dormant period indicating that photosynthetic capacity of tea trees was weak we speculated that tea trees pass into physiological dormancy due to the low ta and the low temperature stress decreased photosynthetic capacity and leaf stomata conductance previous studies also reported that low temperature stress would inhibit evidently photosynthetic capacity and leaf stomata conductance farquhar and sharkey 1981 grantz 1989 strand et al 2002 further analysis showed that the ω average 0 39 was less than 0 5 at the dormant period which indicated that eta might be affected by gc and vpd coupling the relationship between gc and vpd at the period shows that gc decreased with the increase in vpd in a logarithmic pattern fig 12b r 2 0 22 p 0 001 li et al 2010 wever et al 2002 reported that gc was strongly affected by the vpd after the lai reached a high level with ample water similar trends occurred at our site therefore eta was affected by the physiological dormancy and vpd through coupling gc at the dormant period 3 4 3 impacts of extreme climate on evapotranspiration and energy fluxes in our study area both large interannual variation in precipitation cv 23 9 during 2014 2017 and drought at mid growing season occurred during 2015 and 2017 which provided us a valuable chance to investigate the impacts of climate and drought on et compared with historical climate records from 1956 to 2016 2014 and 2017 were near normal years and 2015 and 2016 were considered wet and extremely wet years respectively the observed annual eta values at the tea plantation were 694 732 741 and 732 mm in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 the plentiful rainfall in 2016 1937 mm did not significantly increase the eta compared with 2014 1335 mm 2015 1532 mm and 2017 1103 mm at the tea plantation meanwhile the interannual variation in gpp in our tea plantation site was also small pang et al 2019 hence water demand for tea plantation growth was also enough in the normal years there were significant differences in energy partitioning at mid growing season among 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 the le h at this period was 79 20 13 17 87 80 23 22 88 19 31 93 and 93 14 22 30 w m 2 respectively during 2014 2017 table 5 β showed obvious differences among the study years fig 13 with soil moisture decreasing β and swc had a curvilinear relationship at this period especially when swc was below 0 12 m3 m 3 β significantly increased among 2015 2016 and 2017 a similar trend was documented in the summer extreme drought events in the grass ecosystems by jongen et al 2011 rajan et al 2014 especially for the mid growing season 2016 β reached as high as 2 63 with the prolonged drought the results were mainly due to lack of water supply combined with high vpd average 1 03 kpa leading to a significant reduction in gc 8 16 mm s 1 in 2016 vs 14 1 mm s 1 in 2014 9 5 mm s 1 in 2015 and 10 9 mm s 1 in 2017 and limiting le at the mid growing season meanwhile ω average 0 47 was less than 0 5 which suggested that sensitivity of et to vegetation physiological control was also high at mid growing season 2016 fig 8 the results also indicated that soil water availability strongly affected et and energy partitioning at the mid growing season for tea plantation the relationship between swc and biometeorological factors was analyzed fig 11 at the mid growing season α and gc was sensitive to swc fig 11c g especially when vpd increased gc continued to decrease with water stress fig 11g and asymptotic relationships between gc and swc were also found gc had substantial reduction with swc below 0 12 m3 m 3 fig 11c g the results suggested that eta would be significantly affected by swc at the period due to the large water demand for growth average eta 3 09 mm day 1 when the soil water was below 0 12 m3 m 3 moreover in august and september 2016 the values of eta eto dipped to 0 67 and 0 77 respectively hence when the prolonged drought occurs at the mid growing season the irrigations would be needed however the water demand was not substantial in other seasons and α and gc was insensitive to swc with global climate warming the frequency of drought and heavy precipitation events has greatly increased fowler and hennessy 1995 roshan et al 2013 especially at the rainy season the amounts of total precipitation are large but the precipitation distributions are becoming uneven and the extremely drought events are also increasing in subtropical area china liu et al 2005 ma et al 2015 as the rain fed crop the irrigation schedule for tea plantations in our study area are lacking future studies of transpiration soil water redistribution and root system at our site are needed to improve the understanding of the eta controlling mechanisms and help develop the appropriate irrigation schedule 3 5 inter annual variation in energy flux and evapotranspiration the cumulative annual eta and eto for 2014 2017 is shown in table 7 the annual eta of tea plantation was 725 21 mm eta accounted for 49 of the annual precipitation p 1477 353 mm during the study period which was within the range 45 70 for subtropical forests bossard et al 2015 xiao et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in 2014 with normal precipitation eta accounted for 52 of precipitation with less precipitation in 2017 eta accounted for 66 of precipitation in contrast under the wet conditions in 2015 and 2016 eta accounted for 48 and 38 respectively although the interannual variation in precipitation was large coefficient of variance cv 23 9 the variation in eta is small cv 2 9 at the tea plantation site which was also consistent with the previous studies that forests et had a small interannual variation compared with annual precipitation song et al 2017 yan et al 2017 meanwhile the inter seasonal differences of eta were also small with coefficient of variance cv 9 7 the average seasonal eta was 130 9 10 1 208 9 15 6 284 3 19 2 and 100 5 9 7 mm at the dormant period pruning period mid growing season and late growing season respectively during the study period comparing the annual eta and eto the annual actual evapotranspiration in 2014 and 2015 was slightly less than the annual reference evapotranspiration table 7 however the differences between annual eta and eto were large in 2016 and 2017 the annual eto varied closely with the rn in the tea plantation site pearson correlation coefficient 0 99 the higher rn and ta in 2016 and 2017 led to the higher eto however there was no corresponding increasing in the annual eta that was mainly due to the higher rn occurring in the prolonged drought period in 2016 august and september 2016 and the pruning period in 2017 table 5 during the period eta was significantly affected by the water availability and pruning of canopy respectively which led the large differences between eta and eto in 2016 and 2017 4 summary and conclusion the study investigated four years of successive in situ observation of et and energy fluxes for a tea plantation using the eddy covariance technique the average energy imbalance was about 29 at the tea plantation site thus the corrected le and h data were obtained by forcing the energy closure following to twine et al 2000 and oliphant et al 2004 the seasonal variation of le rn was strongly related to tea plantation phenology with values of 0 69 0 96 for mid growing and late growing seasons and 0 50 0 67 for the pruning and dormant period which are consistent with the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests the inter annual eta showed less temporal variation ranging from 694 741 mm cv 2 9 daily eta had distinct seasonal patterns with the peak values 5 2 6 9 mm day 1 in july daily high correlation between rn and eta suggested that the available energy acted as a primary driver of evapotranspiration in the tea plantation in addition low temperature physiological dormancy vpd and lai also played secondary impacts on eta through their eﬀ ects on canopy surface conductance 10 mm s 1 the highest differences between eta and eto were observed at the pruning period although the water supply was sufficient implying that current pruning practice in april weakened the evapotranspiration capacity of tea plantation moreover our study also found the extreme drought at the mid growing season significantly influenced the energy partitioning and eta would be affected by soil water availability with a swc threshold about 0 12 m3 m 3 at the period with the above analysis a more detailed perspective has been obtained on the dynamics of et and energy fluxes and its meteorological and biophysical controls over the tea plantation these results will be useful for efficient managements of water and simulating land surface water and heat processes over

10497,global warming induced climatological changes limited water resources and water restrictions for agriculture during drought force producers to invest in crops more suited to the potential future climate such as drought tolerant pomegranate trees skilful management of limited and poorer quality water resources is critical to optimize production and fruit quality for a total farm unit and requires appropriate knowledge regarding the crop the review focuses on irrigation methods water requirements of the crop water use efficiency and productivity and water management strategies under limited water supply irrigation and orchard management with regard to irrigation systems drip irrigation appears to be favoured above the more conventional types of irrigation management challenges of subsurface drip irrigation systems though should be taken into account if this type of irrigation is considered the evapotranspiration of subsurface irrigated pomegranate orchards in arid regions ranged from 53 to 953 mm for one to six year old trees and orchard water requirements may increase depending on the irrigation system used and whether weeds are present in the orchard comparison of mathematical relationships to determine crop coefficients from fractional ground cover indicated that the pomegranate cultivar wonderful tended to have lower crop coefficient values than grapevine peach and other deciduous fruit at comparable canopy cover a comparison of advantages and disadvantages of several irrigation strategies identified potential of some to optimise farmer profitability and to comply with customer requirements water deficits during flowering and fruit set may increase aril red colour for some cultivars without detrimental effects on marketable yield fruit size and chemical composition water deficits during ripening and sustained deficit irrigation throughout the season in some cases resulted in improved red colour of fruit peel and or juice but with a negative effect on fruit weight and economic income sustained deficit irrigation at low levels of evapotranspiration replacement is not considered a sustainable strategy for pomegranate orchards over the long term in terms of orchard management olive pomace mulch increased yield and decreased orchard water use different types of mulches can be considered to reduce soil evaporation water losses variable results with different systems and different cultivars in different countries clearly indicate that results from one study cannot simply be transferred to another area where conditions and cultivar types may not be the same this underscores the necessity of conducting research under local conditions keywords aril colour fruit quality irrigation management strategies irrigation methods pomegranate review water requirements water use efficiency water use productivity yield 1 introduction in south africa global warming induced climatological changes are expected to impact negatively on the already limited water resources of the western cape wcdoa and wcdea and dp 2016 and water restrictions for agriculture are already an inevitable reality during drought years it is furthermore predicted that the western region of south africa will have a significant reduction in streamflow with potentially sombre implications for irrigated agriculture increased temperatures will result in an increased irrigation demand for deciduous fruit orchards but the irrigation volume for the agricultural sector is unlikely to increase as the department of water affairs has capped agricultural allocations at current levels water demand and supply forecasts for some water management areas indicated a severe 20 to 80 and moderate 0 to 20 gap between the existing supply in 2010 and projected demand in 2030 mckinsey company 2010 improved agricultural water use efficiency and productivity is considered a necessity to provide the water needed for the projected increased water demand by human consumption and industrial activity by 2030 such limited water resource availability makes maximizing net income per unit water used a prerequisite for sustainable farming one way to cope with this situation is to invest in crops more suited to the potential future climate such as drought tolerant pomegranate trees dea 2016 galindo et al 2017b in south africa the pomegranate industry is small but growing production started in the early 2000 s and south africa is presently an international role player in production and exports from the southern hemisphere to various northern hemisphere countries viljoen 2019 although pomegranate trees are considered drought tolerant irrigation is required during the dry summer to optimise growth yield and fruit quality for commercial production skilful management of limited water resources will be a necessity if optimal production and fruit quality are to be retained for a total farm unit for efficient in field water management correct irrigation system selection design and maintenance are very important but efficient irrigation scheduling is the key to achieving high irrigation water use efficiency although there are general guidelines for the irrigation of pomegranate trees pomegranate association of south africa pomasa 2013 there are no local research results available to guide producers with regard to tree water use requirements or the effect of different levels of soil water depletion on pomegranate tree growth yield and fruit quality under local conditions a review of international pomegranate research warranted to provide guidance until local research generates guidelines for south african producers on how to achieve the best water use productivity without compromising fruit quality this review focuses on irrigation methods water requirements of the crop water use efficiency and productivity and water management strategies under limited water supply irrigation and orchard management a separate review focuses on the effects of water deficits on tree physiology growth yield and fruit quality 2 methods of irrigation according to holland et al 2009 most of the large commercial orchards in israel india and the united states of america use drip irrigation methods although some producers prefer sprinklers however in california usa most pomegranate orchards are irrigated with flood or furrow with few farmers using high frequency surface or subsurface drip wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 in india it is general practice to irrigate crops by conventional methods i e flood furrow ring basin methods with almost 38 of the micro irrigated crops in india being drip irrigated kumar et al 2016 singh and sharma 2013 adoption of micro irrigation systems in the country are deterred by amongst other factors physical socio economic and institutional constraints kaarthikeyan and suresh 2019 kumar et al 2016 in south africa drip single and double line and microsprinkler irrigation are also practiced whereas overhead irrigation is not recommended for pomegranates pomegranate association of south africa pomasa 2013 volschenk and mulidzi 2019 the benefits of drip irrigation compared to conventional irrigation in indian pomegranate orchards included c 42 increased yield and c 38 higher net returns for farmers in the kullu district in himachal pradesh singh and sharma 2013 according to kumar et al 2013 use of an auxiliary reservoir in combination with drip irrigation saved a substantial amount of irrigation water c 32 compared to surface methods in an arid punjab region the efficiency of surface irrigation methods in both of these studies was decreased by limited availability of irrigation water and rainfall or canal operational timings which did not necessarily match the critical development stages of crops in comparison to surface irrigation systems drip irrigation increased pomegranate irrigation water productivity in the punjab region by 82 5 32 kg m 3 while net profit per mm water applied almost doubled for drip irrigation kumar et al 2013 the extraordinary high irrigation water productivity for the drip irrigation system compared to the surface irrigated methods in this case may be explained by more efficiently managed crop water demand which may have resulted in water savings better growth and higher yield frequent drip irrigation furthermore limited variation in soil water availability and decreased pomegranate fruit cracking by 10 15 which increased marketable yield ghosh et al 2013 also found that drip irrigated plants had less fruit cracking than basin irrigated plants further potential advantages of drip irrigation over the conventional methods i e flood furrow ring basin include a saving of up to 50 of water lower labour costs related to weed control and application of fertilizers and pesticides and better control over water application on sloping terrain and variable soils singh and sharma 2013 benefits of well managed surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation systems include eliminated or reduced runoff and deep drainage minimized surface soil and plant evaporation reduced transpiration of drought tolerant crops and reduced fertilizer losses ayars et al 1999 subsurface compared to surface drip irrigation on a sandy loam soil in california resulted in a significant increase in yield of prime good colour diameter 80 mm minimal cracking with no open cracks and or subprime suitable for juice green open cracked fruit for some years ayars et al 2017 wang et al 2015 total yield was consistently higher in the subsurface compared to surface drip system but due to an additional 10 water being applied to the surface drip irrigation treatment to compensate for evaporative water loss and weed growth not significantly different ayars et al 2017 use of subsurface drip irrigation resulted in reduced weed pressure compared to surface drip irrigation irrigation water productivity ranged between c 5 15 and 5 58 kg m 3 for surface and between 5 97 and 6 04 kg m 3 for subsurface drip irrigation although subsurface drip irrigation systems have advantages there are also some disadvantages to take into account lamm 2002 these include wetting pattern issues on coarse soils difficulties in monitoring and evaluation of system operation and application efficiency emitter discharge rates and water redistribution disparities restricted plant root development and its role in irrigation and fertilization and crop water stresses even when the root zone is well watered in a study by ayars et al 2017 subsurface drip irrigation of pomegranate trees on a sandy loam soil required high frequency irrigation applying irrigation after 1 mm water use resulted in 10 12 irrigations per day during peak water use 3 water requirements information on water requirements of crops are needed to decide whether production of a certain crop is viable in a specific region crop water requirement is the amount of water that needs to be supplied to replace water lost through evapotranspiration water requirements of crops can be determined by direct measurement of the consumptive water use energy balance and micrometeorological methods soil water balance lysimeters or it can be estimated indirectly using mathematical models 3 1 reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for purposes of irrigation scheduling crop water requirements etc is frequently estimated according to the guidelines of fao56 allen et al 1998 using weather data based penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficients kc to calculate eto the following data are needed solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed measured at 2 m or converted to that height above an extensive surface of green grass shading the ground and not short of water the eto can be estimated for hourly daily or ten day to monthly time intervals using the appropriate calculations reference evapotranspiration can also be quantified using other less accurate models that require less extensive weather data sets meshram et al 2011 or by monitoring class a pan evaporation allen et al 1998 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 a pan factor kp is used for conversion of class a pan evaporation to eto allen et al 1998 long term meteorological data have also been used to estimate eto for some of the pomegranate irrigation research done in india meshram et al 2010a b 2011 bhagat and popale 2016 iran parvizi et al 2014 and egypt seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 although fao56 allen et al 1998 contains kc values for various crops data are not listed for pomegranate trees crop coefficients are experimentally determined ratios of etc eto and kc based on class a pan evaporation are not interchangeable with those developed using eto crop coefficients can be determined based on etc measured accurately using weighing or drainage lysimeters ayars et al 2017 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 zhang et al 2017 or etc derived from a soil water balance allen et al 1998 alternatively the pomegranate kc can be estimated from site specific empirical relationships of kc versus day of year ayars et al 2017 parvizi et al 2014 or from fractional canopy ground cover meshram et al 2010a 2011 zhang et al 2017 as indicated in fig 1 zhang et al 2017 developed different mathematical relationships between kc and fractional canopy ground cover for bushy uc kare and vase shaped usda ars pomegranate cv wonderful trees in california comparison of these pomegranate specific kc estimates to those for peach ayars et al 2003 grapevine williams and ayars 2005 and the general deciduous fruit equation used by meshram et al 2011 indicated that the pomegranate cultivar wonderful tended to have lower kc values at comparable fractional ground cover also measured as shaded area cast on the ground than these crops fig 1 the differences in slopes and intercepts of these relationships are ascribed to differences in methods used to determine etc and the shaded areas and dissimilarities in cultivation practices specifically irrigation amounts and frequencies williams and ayars 2005 for pomegranate from the sources used by this review only the kc values generated by research of ayars et al 2017 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 and zhang et al 2017 are based on lysimeter measurements those of bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 were intended for use with class a pan evaporation and are suitable for a range of irrigation water salinities between 0 8 and 8 ds m 1 the class a pan crop coefficients for non saline conditions for one year old wonderful plants were 0 16 at bud break and 0 64 at 120 days after bud break in california the maximum kc for use with penman monteith derived eto increased for subsurface drip irrigated wonderful pomegranate trees from 0 85 for four year old trees to between 1 and 1 2 for six year old trees bearing c 33 2 and 50 4 t ha 1 fruit respectively ayars et al 2017 intrigliolo et al 2011 adapted kc values based on those of bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 for spanish research conditions intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 whereas buesa et al 2012 initially used the farmer irrigation schedule and experimentally developed crop coefficients using soil water content and stem water potential measurements as calibration aid bugueño et al 2016 also based their research for young pomegranate trees on a kc value of bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 and recommended upward adjustment thereof since trunk growth rate was higher in the 130 etc compared to the 100 etc treatment martinez nicolás et al 2019 used bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 as reference to obtain kc values for seven year old mollar de elche and wonderful trees differences in phenological development between cultivars was taken into account and the control treatment was irrigated at 115 etc 3 2 crop evapotranspiration from the articles sourced for this review the only lysimeter measured daily etc data for young pomegranate orchards were available from israel bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 daily etc of one year old punica granatum l plants during 2008 ranged from 0 23 to 5 mm d 1 from bud burst to peak season the class a pan evaporation during this period ranged between c 3 1 and 9 2 mm d 1 the young tree peak water use is about half of that measured in the mediterranean climate of the central valley of california for bearing six year old wonderful pomegranate trees 10 5 mm d 1 ayars et al 2017 there were minor cultivar related differences in daily etc of the one year old wonderful and sp 2 varieties and their response to a range of irrigation water salinities between 0 8 ds m 1 and 8 ds m 1 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 salinity significantly reduced daily etc of the pomegranate plants which should be taken into account during irrigation scheduling to prevent excessive leaching the seasonal etc march to november for one year old wonderful and sp 2 plants irrigated with low salinity water in israel during 2008 was 544 mm and 557 mm respectively amounting to about a third of the 1521 mm cumulative class a pan evaporation bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 irrigation of these trees with water having salinity of 1 4 3 3 4 8 and 8 ds m 1 reduced the seasonal etc relative to that of trees irrigated with 0 8 ds m 1 water by 15 23 44 and 66 respectively in 2010 and 2012 yearly etc of one and three year old wonderful subsurface drip irrigated plants in california was c 4 c 53 mm and c 35 483 mm of the c 1263 and c 1387 mm eto respectively ayars et al 2017 the yearly etc of bearing four five and six year old trees were c 683 c 912 and c 953 mm respectively which amounted to 49 62 and 69 of the cumulative eto actual seasonal evapotranspiration of nine year old manfalouty pomegranate trees grown in sandy desert soils in the el maghara region egypt was determined by measuring soil moisture content gravimetrically seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 the etc of trees drip irrigated every second day from february to october over three years totalled c 483 mm on average with a maximum daily water use of 2 7 mm d 1 during the season the eto for the 2008 2010 seasons amounted to 1334 16 mm on average soil water balance determined seasonal evapotranspiration of six year old hicaznar pomegranate trees planted in 1 2 m deep loamy soil in turkey ranged between 775 2 and 825 6 mm during three seasons whereas the eto amounted to 751 5 34 4 dinc et al 2018 3 3 irrigation water requirement in addition to etc the irrigation water requirement takes effective rainfall into account and may include extra water to compensate for irrigation system efficiency and or for leaching of salts allen et al 1998 methods for estimation of etc and the irrigation water requirement differed widely between countries and research studies sourced for this review due to site specific differences in amongst other factors evaporative demand orchard spacing cultivars tree canopy cover soil type wetted area and irrigation water salinity however the measured amounts of irrigation water applied to well watered control treatments of drip irrigated irrigation research projects conducted in various countries in young to full bearing orchards give an indication of the variation in irrigation water requirement of pomegranate orchards fig 2 in california on fine sandy loam non bearing trees of the cultivar wonderful received 25 and 216 mm drip irrigation respectively in the first and second season ayars et al 2017 the amount increased in subsequent seasons for bearing three four five and six year old subsurface drip irrigated pomegranate trees to 427 584 780 and 843 mm of irrigation water and to 472 645 848 and 932 mm for surface drip irrigated trees of similar age in turkey irrigation applied to double line drip irrigated hicaznar trees in loamy soil amounted to 430 455 5 and 410 mm dinc et al 2018 in iran the maximum amount of irrigation applied to the pomegranate cvs shahvar and rabab on loam and fine sandy loam soils was 972 and 1214 mm respectively parvizi et al 2014 selahvarzi et al 2017 the amount of irrigation water applied to the cvs mollar de elche and wonderful in spain on sandy loam silt loam and sandy clay loam soils ranged between 392 mm and 776 mm buesa et al 2012 intrigliolo et al 2011 2012 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 peña estévez et al 2015 2016 with regard to canopy cover of these orchards no information was available for the non bearing trees in california ayars et al 2017 nor for the seven year old mollar de elche and wonderful trees from spain martínez nicolás et al 2019 however maximum canopy ground cover for the surface drip irrigated three four and five year old wonderful orchards was c 20 9 46 2 and c 81 3 respectively compared to c 21 1 51 and 85 7 for the subsurface irrigated trees zhang et al 2017 canopy cover of the shavar cultivar in iran is given as c 50 selahvarzi et al 2017 whereas the canopy diameter of rabab was 2 m in an orchard spaced 5m 4m parvizi et al 2014 the full canopy ground cover of most of the between 11 and 13 year old spanish mollar de elche orchards ranged between 48 and 56 buesa et al 2012 intrigliolo et al 2011 2012 2013 4 water use efficiency and water productivity in addition to water production functions water use efficiency and biophysical and economical water productivity indicators can assist in decision making on on farm irrigation fernández et al 2020 definitions of the terms water use efficiency and water use productivity in the research surveyed by this review was inconsistent and the terms cannot be used interchangeably between studies table 1 the water use indicator terminology for this review was therefore standardised according to fernández et al 2020 and references therein crop water use efficiency is defined as the crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 divided by the amount of water applied by irrigation and precipitation m3 ha 1 there are several options available to calculate crop water productivity kg m 3 but for the purpose of this article it is defined as yield kg ha 1 divided by crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 water productivity values calculated by using crop evapotranspiration estimated as the total of effective precipitation and irrigation as denominator is considered to be unreliable irrigation water productivity is defined as yield kg ha 1 divided by the total amount of water applied by irrigation m3 ha 1 economic crop water productivity quantifies the relation between production earnings in monetary terms and water usage economic irrigation water productivity currency unit per m3 can be calculated using the gross margin revenue accounted for variable costs net margin revenue accounted for variable and fixed costs or profit revenue accounted for variable fixed and opportunity costs per hectare divided by irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 of these the net margin or profit is considered most appropriate for decision making on profitable irrigation management of fruit tree crops fernández et al 2020 based on general agreement marketable yield is used as numerator to calculate irrigation water productivity fernández et al 2020 however for pomegranate orchards dinc et al 2018 ghosh et al 2013 khattab et al 2011 parvizi et al 2014 and seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 used total yield in calculations whereas there is not clarity whether kumar et al 2013 and martínez nicolás et al 2019 used total or marketable yield refer to comments table 1 ayars et al 2017 calculated irrigation water productivity for prime fruit destined for the fresh fruit market sub prime fruit for juicing included some green and open cracked fruit and for total yield whereas selahvarzi et al 2017 used marketable yield irrigation water productivity may be overestimated in the cases where the total yield does not represent marketable yield furthermore it was not possible to accurately define the economic crop water productivity reported by intrigliolo et al 2013 due to lack of economic analysis information higher irrigation water productivity for subsurface compared to surface drip irrigated pomegranate trees was due to higher yield and less water applied to the subsurface irrigated trees ayars et al 2017 the irrigation water productivity for four five and six year old trees was 6 04 6 1 and 5 97 kg m 3 for the subsurface drip and 5 15 5 35 and 5 58 kg m 3 for the surface drip irrigated trees deficit irrigation resulted in increasing water productivity fruit yield divided by irrigation applied rainfall of mollar de elche pomegranate trees intrigliolo et al 2013 the average increase in water productivity over three years relative to the control 3 9 kg m 3 was particularly noticeable in the sustained deficit irrigation 5 9 kg m 3 treatment and where regulated deficit irrigation was applied during flowering and fruit set 4 9 kg m 3 the sustained deficit irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments were successful in increasing water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity maintaining the yield value at similar levels to the control intrigliolo et al 2013 however there was a definite impact of sustained deficit irrigation on fruit size and consequently on farmer income more recently martinez nicolás et al 2019 confirmed that withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set for the cvs mollar de elche and wonderful improved irrigation water productivity by c 14 5 and c 10 on average over two seasons compared to where full irrigation was applied irrigation water productivity 5 6 and 7 1 kg m 3 for the respective cultivars irrigation water productivity increased due to water savings with no significant effect of deficit irrigation on marketable yield deficit irrigation applied at 75 etc and 50 etc increased irrigation water productivity of the cv rabab by 15 and c 27 respectively on average over two seasons compared to trees irrigated at 100 etc irrigation water productivity 4 2 kg m 3 parvizi et al 2014 however partial rootzone drying strategies applied at these respective etc levels over the same period increased the irrigation water productivity on average by 38 and c 51 compared to the fully irrigated trees parvizi et al 2014 the increased irrigation water productivity of the 75 etc partial rootzone drying strategy was mainly due to increased fruit number comparable fruit weight and 22 less water use relative to the fully irrigated trees for the 50 etc partial rootzone drying strategy a c 16 yield loss and almost 45 decrease in irrigation water use relative to the trees irrigated at 100 etc resulted in the huge relative increase in irrigation water productivity poorer relative irrigation water productivity at the deficit irrigated trees compared to the partial root zone irrigated trees at both etc levels can be attributed to greater yield losses 11 and 30 at the 75 etc and 50 etc levels respectively irrigating only one side of the root zone at a four day interval throughout the season reduced fruit number and size per tree to greater extent compared to where irrigation was alternated between two sides of the root zone in the first and second season a regulated deficit irrigation strategy no irrigation until end fruit set 100 etc remainder of season applied to seven year old shavar pomegranate trees in iran selahvarzi et al 2017 increased irrigation water productivity relative to the control 2 15 and 2 45 kg m 3 by c 50 and 39 respectively the higher irrigation water productivity was mainly ascribed to a c 18 irrigation water saving as yield tended to be but was not significantly lower relative to the control although the sustained deficit irrigation treatment increased irrigation water productivity in the first season by c 59 compared to the control the detrimental long term effect of severe water deficits on trees reduced the irrigation water productivity of the sustained deficit irrigation strategy in the second season to levels similar to those of the control the irrigation water productivity of 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees in egypt was calculated as yield divided by the scheduled amount of water per treatment khattab et al 2011 the treatment receiving 520 mm water per season had the highest irrigation water productivity i e 3 22 and 2 91 kg m 3 water applied the irrigation water productivity decreased significantly when less or more than 520 mm water was applied the underlying reason for this trend may be water stress related yield decreases in the drier treatments and inefficient water use in the wetter treatment in turkey differences in crop water productivity of several irrigation treatments including sustained deficit irrigation treatments were not statistically significant dinc et al 2018 during three seasons crop water productivity ranged between 2 8 and 4 6 kg m 3 irrigation water productivity ranged between 5 95 and 10 66 kg m 3 for a high value crop such as pomegranate crop water productivity and irrigation water productivity values should be interpreted carefully as they do not reflect the effect of water use on yield and fruit quality combined which determines farmer profit at the end of the day for this purpose the use of economic crop water productivity or economic irrigation water productivity is highly recommended for decision making regarding selection of suitable irrigation strategies taking into account the specific production target fernández et al 2020 5 water management strategies under limited water supply water stress can be induced deliberately in fruit trees by withholding irrigation or by applying less water than plants require for maximum evapotranspiration a method called regulated deficit irrigation mitchell et al 1984 the effect of irrigation strategies on trees may differ depending on the timing and level of the water deficit applied the duration thereof the climatic conditions of the area and the drought tolerance of the crop via avoidance and tolerance mechanisms where irrigation water is a limited or costly resource well managed deficit irrigation improves both water productivity and producer profitability as compared to full irrigation fernández et al 2020 and references therein in selection of suitable irrigation strategies the producer should focus on environmentally sustainable methods that optimise yield over the long term and on production targets e g fresh fruit juice pharmaceuticals cosmetics wine that maximise profit for a specific orchard 5 1 irrigation management selected research regarding irrigation strategies for mollar de elche pomegranate trees and advantages and disadvantages of the strategies are listed in tables 2 and 3 water savings relative to a well watered control ranged between c 14 and 100 for a range of experimental periods pertaining to the different studies irrigation strategies that did not affect yield negatively and maintained or improved marketability relative to well watered trees saved between 14 1 and 29 irrigation water galindo et al 2014b 2017a intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 to evaluate the suitability of a specific irrigation strategy knowledge is required regarding the effect of water deficits on crop growth during different phenological stages studies that focussed specifically on the effect of water deficits during linear fruit growth and or ripening of the cultivar mollar de elche include that of cano lamadrid et al 2018 galindo et al 2014a b 2017a and mellisho et al 2012 however the effect of sustained deficit irrigation mena et al 2013 intrigliolo et al 2013 and regulated deficit irrigation at different phenological stages intrigliolo et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 on the performance of the cultivar was evaluated as well fruit ripening is a critical period for the cv mollar de elche as irrigation is required during most of this phenological period to achieve maximum yield galindo et al 2017a however withholding water for six days before harvest saved 14 water relative to well watered trees while it increased fruit peel colour and enhanced bioactive compound content with no negative impact on marketable yield 37 1 t ha 1 or fruit size table 2 advanced harvest time may result in earlier market access and improved fruit prices for producers interested in the processing market red colour of juice improved whereas fruit size at harvest decreased by c 14 when water was withheld for 25 and 34 days before harvest using 62 and 100 less water compared to the well watered trees total yield decreased by c 8 and 23 for these two scenarios and marketable yield by 49 and 69 according to peña estévez et al 2015 withholding water from 16 and 26 days before harvest saved c 6 and 11 water and increased shelf life of arils by 4 days compared to a well watered control arils from deficit irrigated fruit had better visual appearance and overall quality but had lower anthocyanin content and a slightly red orange colour the total soluble solids where water was withheld for 26 days was slightly higher whereas there was no effect relative to the control where water was withheld for 16 days in contrast to the findings of galindo et al 2017a intrigliolo et al 2013 found that 25 etc regulated deficit irrigation applied during ripening to mollar de elche trees did not affect yield fruit number fruit weight or economic yield value whereas the strategies saved 18 of water and tended to have increased economic irrigation water productivity relative to the control table 3 furthermore fruit had higher levels of total soluble solids at harvest and throughout 8 and 19 weeks cold storage enhanced red peel colour and more anthocyanins in juice after 8 and 19 weeks cold storage compared to well watered trees less external physiological disorders and fruit weight loss occurred after 19 weeks storage and a seven day shelf life period regulated deficit irrigation applied during ripening though may result in increased fruit cracking in some seasons the differences in the outcomes of this research regarding regulated deficit irrigation during ripening compared to that of galindo et al 2014b 2017a may be partially explained by differences in crop load c 49 lower yield for well watered trees less water stress that developed and the fact that irrigation was applied six to seven times a week during summer and weekly during autumn intrigliolo et al 2013 amongst the sustained deficit irrigation and various regulated deficit irrigation treatments the best strategy for mollar de elche was 25 etc application only during the main flower and reproductive organs drop period with 100 etc applied during the rest of the season intrigliolo et al 2013 this strategy saved c 12 water relative to the 100 etc treatment and increased yield via more fruit of slightly lower weight table 3 water deficits did not affect the fruit total soluble solids the economic yield value was not affected but crop water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity increased relative to the control external physiological disorders after cold storage was less compared to the control disadvantages of this strategy are that it decreased the maturity index at harvest and had no positive effect on the juice anthocyanins or antioxidant capacity for the cvs mollar de elche and wonderful the flowering and fruit set phenological phase can be considered non critical because sensitivity to water stress during this period was low martinez nicolás et al 2019 under the conditions of the study withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set saved between 19 and 30 irrigation water with no detrimental effect on marketable yield fruit size or chemical composition tables 2 and 4 a regulated deficit irrigation strategy applying 25 etc during the linear fruit growth period reduced fruit weight by only c 6 and saved 24 of water relative to the control intrigliolo et al 2013 table 3 this strategy had no effect on the economic yield value but increased economic irrigation water productivity juice total soluble solids compared to the control increased after 19 weeks storage and seven days shelf life although the maturity index was lower at harvest juice anthocyanins at harvest and notably after 8 and 19 weeks of storage and shelf life period increased relative to the control fruit irrigated according to this strategy may in some seasons be susceptible to cracking although 50 etc applied for three years during the entire growing season sustained deficit irrigation saved 44 water relative to the 100 etc treatment it had no negative impact on yield in the mediterranean area of southeastern spain table 3 over three years trees were on average bearing c 28 more fruit of c 22 lower weight which decreased the economic yield value relative to the control by 28 table 3 intrigliolo et al 2013 red fruit peel colour was enhanced at harvest and throughout cold storage and shelf life but turned yellowish at the end of storage and shelf life despite the latter fruit were still more red than those of the other irrigation treatments laribi et al 2013 juice anthocyanins increased notably relative to the control after 19 weeks of storage and the following shelf life period taking the smaller fruit size and marketability thereof into account the sustained deficit irrigation strategy may be more suitable for producers targeting the juice industry intrigliolo et al 2013 fruit had less external physiological disorders and aril browning and less fruit weight loss after cold storage and shelf life compared to a well watered control furthermore the sustained deficit irrigation reduced vegetative growth markedly which may affect tree productivity in the long term especially if trees are still young intrigliolo et al 2013 when the strategy is imposed fruit of trees subjected to the sustained deficit irrigation strategy may in some seasons also be prone to increased sunburn compared to well watered trees of all the irrigation strategies evaluated in this research sustained deficit irrigation increased water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity the most relative to the control according to bartual et al 2015a sustained deficit irrigation and to a lesser extent 25 etc regulated deficit irrigation during ripening could be used as tools to accelerate the fruit ripening date of mollar de elche fruit due to faster sugar accumulation this has important implications for marketing pomegranate fruit the red coloration and higher sugar content may advance harvest time if the cultivar is picked according to external coloration with the prospect to fetch better prices if you can get in the market earlier laribi et al 2013 with regard to the cultivar wonderful 75 etc sustained deficit irrigation increased yield relative to trees irrigated at 100 etc in the third year that deficit irrigation was applied zhang et al 2017 however there is a paucity of data regarding quality of the fruit and the exact amount of water applied table 4 indications during the second year of deficit irrigation were that sustained deficit irrigation at 35 etc may have a detrimental effect on fruit colour centofanti et al 2017 irrigation at 60 etc during fruit growth and ripening also had a detrimental effect on fruit juice colour and reduced yield by 41 cano lamadrid et al 2018 whereas applying 100 etc to only one side instead of to the full root zone may reduce incidence of cracking noitsakis et al 2016 research from iran for the cv rabab indicated positive effects of 75 etc partial rootzone drying on yield and juice content with c 22 water saved relative to a well watered control parvizi et al 2014 2016 this irrigation strategy increased irrigation water productivity significantly compared to a well irrigated control and trees deficit irrigated at 75 and 50 etc on one side of the root zone only table 5 one has to keep in mind though that the partial rootzone drying strategy can increase labour or irrigation system costs in contrast to the findings of noitsakis et al 2016 regarding cracking for the cv wonderful fruit cracking increased for rabab relative to a well watered control where irrigation was applied at 75 or 50 etc to one side of the root zone also in iran for the cultivar shavar no irrigation applied from the beginning of the season until fruit set followed by irrigation at 100 etc during the remainder of the season resulted in reduced vegetative growth with a compact flowering period improved fruit set and weight with no effect on yield and increased total phenolic compounds compared to the control table 5 selahvarzi et al 2017 on the contrary sustained deficit irrigation applied at 50 etc decreased yield and had negative carry over effects on vegetative growth and flowering in the second season although fruit juice had higher total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity compared to the control the regulated deficit irrigation strategy applied c 18 less water compared to the control and the sustained deficit irrigation strategy 50 less both strategies had higher irrigation water productivity compared to the control treatment in the first season but were comparable to well watered trees in the second based on the currently sourced research tables 2 5 sustained deficit irrigation may supply a market for smaller pomegranates with increased red peel and or juice however a sustained deficit irrigation strategy applying 50 etc or less in dry and arid regions may in most cases not be sustainable and cannot be recommended over the long term for profitable pomegranate production in this regard more research addressing the carry over effects of water deficits on vegetative growth and reproductive bud development between seasons is needed 5 2 orchard management in egypt etc decreased and yield progressively increased as the drip irrigation interval for manfalouty trees in fine sandy soils increased from 2 to 4 to 6 days seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 according to seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 and references therein the highest pomegranate yield is obtained when the soil reaches 60 or 40 of field capacity between irrigations young ganesh trees achieved maximum yield where 40 of evaporated water was replaced while application of more water promoted competition between vegetative and fruit growth which decreased yield afria et al 1998 application of olive pomace mulch decreased etc compared to no mulch weeds or petroleum applied as bitumen emulsion mulch seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 olive pomace mulched trees had the highest yield followed by the bitumen emulsion mulched trees with the lowest yield in trees with no mulch irrespective of mulching treatment yield increased as irrigation interval increased fig 3 yield increases relative to the crop without mulch ranged between 12 and 40 for the bitumen emulsion mulch and between 35 and 101 for the olive pomace mulch the positive effect of the olive pomace mulch may be associated with pronounced increases in soil temperature which may increase both water and nutrient consumption by tree roots which in turn affect the crop yield the highest crop water productivity was obtained for a combination of a 6 day irrigation interval and olive pomace mulch the crop water productivity increased as trees aged and it amounted to 5 55 5 59 and 5 65 kg m 3 for three respective seasons similarly the irrigation water productivity equalled 4 14 4 31 and 4 49 kg m 3 during the three seasons the positive effect of mulches on pomegranate fruit yield have been reported previously whereas mulching also reduced fruit cracking seidhom and abd el rahman and references therein 2011 however straw mulching in drip irrigated pomegranates did not improve crop water productivity but ineffectiveness of mulch treatments was attributed to water infiltration problems especially during dry months ghosh et al 2013 use of new mulches for soil water conservation in arid regions has been introduced as an alternative to conventional plastic mulches farzi et al 2017 different mulch materials differed in soil water conservation efficiency and reduced evaporation relative to bare soil by between 35 and 63 de oiled olive pomace mulch and pistachio shell mulch as new mulch materials seems more favourable for conserving soil water compared to the other materials fig 4 makus et al 2014 found in row durable white plastic to be beneficial to retain soil water reduce chemical weed control required increase total fruit yield by c 20 and improve juice colour white plastic improved midday orchard floor reflectance reduced surface temperatures and decreased variability in soil temperatures at several depths up to 300 mm deep white plastic had no significant effect on fruit peel colour trees grown under white plastic mulch had more basal sucker production at the end of the season whereas irrigation rate also increased sucker frequency and size 6 conclusions to be able to farm water efficient profitable and sustainable currently remains a challenge for pomegranate producers although biophysical and economic water productivity indicators may be useful in on farm irrigation decision making reliable crop evapotranspiration information for the calculation of these indicators is not readily available to farmers to determine orchard crop evapotranspiration accurately is complex and expensive for the moment the use of irrigation water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity that takes into account the costs involved in perennial fruit crop production and the specific markets targeted appears to be a more viable approach further research is required to provide the necessary information to improve irrigation management and as such support sustainable farming amidst climate change i e higher temperatures changing rainfall patterns and increasingly limited water resources with regard to irrigation scheduling crop coefficients developed for different irrigation systems and different cultivars in different countries cannot necessarily be applied directly elsewhere it will be very useful if the water use transpiration and evapotranspiration of a range of young to full bearing pomegranate orchards is quantified accurately with the purpose of developing a model for practical estimation of crop coefficients under local conditions such a model covering a range of fractional light interception regimes could enable extrapolation of the study findings to other orchards in other production areas splitting the orchard crop coefficient into a separate transpiration and soil evaporation coefficient may enable a more accurate estimate of orchard water use such a model will aid producers to schedule irrigation according to tree water requirements and prevent over or under irrigation which impacts the environment leaching of fertilizers and water losses and fruit tree

10497,global warming induced climatological changes limited water resources and water restrictions for agriculture during drought force producers to invest in crops more suited to the potential future climate such as drought tolerant pomegranate trees skilful management of limited and poorer quality water resources is critical to optimize production and fruit quality for a total farm unit and requires appropriate knowledge regarding the crop the review focuses on irrigation methods water requirements of the crop water use efficiency and productivity and water management strategies under limited water supply irrigation and orchard management with regard to irrigation systems drip irrigation appears to be favoured above the more conventional types of irrigation management challenges of subsurface drip irrigation systems though should be taken into account if this type of irrigation is considered the evapotranspiration of subsurface irrigated pomegranate orchards in arid regions ranged from 53 to 953 mm for one to six year old trees and orchard water requirements may increase depending on the irrigation system used and whether weeds are present in the orchard comparison of mathematical relationships to determine crop coefficients from fractional ground cover indicated that the pomegranate cultivar wonderful tended to have lower crop coefficient values than grapevine

pomegranate review water requirements water use efficiency water use productivity yield 1 introduction in south africa global warming induced climatological changes are expected to impact negatively on the already limited water resources of the western cape wcdoa and wcdea and dp 2016 and water restrictions for agriculture are already an inevitable reality during drought years it is furthermore predicted that the western region of south africa will have a significant reduction in streamflow with potentially sombre implications for irrigated agriculture increased temperatures will result in an increased irrigation demand for deciduous fruit orchards but the irrigation volume for the agricultural sector is unlikely to increase as the department of water affairs has capped agricultural allocations at current levels water demand and supply forecasts for some water management areas indicated a severe 20 to 80 and moderate 0 to 20 gap between the existing supply in 2010 and projected demand in 2030 mckinsey company 2010 improved agricultural water use efficiency and productivity is considered a necessity to provide the water needed for the projected increased water demand by human consumption and industrial activity by 2030 such limited water resource availability makes maximizing net income per unit water used a prerequisite for sustainable farming one way to cope with this situation is to invest in crops more suited to the potential future climate such as drought tolerant pomegranate trees dea 2016 galindo et al 2017b in south africa the pomegranate industry is small but growing production started in the early 2000 s and south africa is presently an international role player in production and exports from the southern hemisphere to various northern hemisphere countries viljoen 2019 although pomegranate trees are considered drought tolerant irrigation is required during the dry summer to optimise growth yield and fruit quality for commercial production skilful management of limited water resources will be a necessity if optimal production and fruit quality are to be retained for a total farm unit for efficient in field water management correct irrigation system selection design and maintenance are very important but efficient irrigation scheduling is the key to achieving high irrigation water use efficiency although there are general guidelines for the irrigation of pomegranate trees pomegranate association of south africa pomasa 2013 there are no local research results available to guide producers with regard to tree water use

warranted to provide guidance until local research generates guidelines for south african producers on how to achieve the best water use productivity without compromising fruit quality this review focuses on irrigation methods water requirements of the crop water use efficiency and productivity and water management strategies under limited water supply irrigation and orchard management a separate review focuses on the effects of water deficits on tree physiology growth yield and fruit quality 2 methods of irrigation according to holland et al 2009 most of the large commercial orchards in israel india and the united states of america use drip irrigation methods although some producers prefer sprinklers however in california usa most pomegranate orchards are irrigated with flood or furrow with few farmers using high frequency surface or subsurface drip wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 in india it is general practice to irrigate crops by conventional methods i e flood furrow ring basin methods with almost 38 of the micro irrigated crops in india being drip irrigated kumar et al 2016 singh and sharma 2013 adoption of micro irrigation systems in the country are deterred by amongst other factors physical socio economic and institutional constraints kaarthikeyan and suresh 2019 kumar et al 2016 in south africa drip single and double line and microsprinkler irrigation are also practiced whereas overhead irrigation is not recommended for pomegranates pomegranate association of south africa pomasa 2013 volschenk and mulidzi 2019 the benefits of drip irrigation compared to conventional irrigation in indian pomegranate orchards included c 42 increased yield and c 38 higher net returns for farmers in the kullu district in himachal pradesh singh and sharma 2013 according to kumar et al 2013 use of an auxiliary reservoir in combination with drip irrigation saved a substantial amount of irrigation water c 32 compared to surface methods in an arid punjab region the efficiency of surface irrigation methods in both of these studies was decreased by limited availability of irrigation water and rainfall or canal operational timings which did not necessarily match the critical development stages of crops in comparison to surface irrigation systems drip irrigation increased pomegranate irrigation water productivity in the punjab region by 82 5 32 kg m 3 while net profit per mm water applied almost doubled for drip irrigation kumar et al 2013 the extraordinary high irrigation water productivity for the drip irrigation system compared to the surface irrigated methods in this case may be explained by more efficiently managed crop water demand which may have resulted in water savings better growth and higher yield frequent drip irrigation furthermore limited variation in soil water availability and decreased pomegranate fruit cracking by 10 15 which increased marketable yield ghosh et al 2013 also found that drip irrigated plants had less fruit cracking than basin irrigated plants further potential advantages of drip irrigation over the conventional methods i e flood furrow ring basin include a saving of up to 50 of water lower labour costs related to weed control and application of fertilizers and pesticides and better control over water application on sloping terrain and variable soils singh and sharma 2013 benefits of well managed surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation systems include eliminated or reduced runoff and deep drainage minimized surface soil and plant evaporation reduced transpiration of drought tolerant crops and reduced fertilizer losses ayars et al 1999 subsurface compared to surface drip irrigation on a sandy loam soil in california resulted in a significant increase in yield of prime good colour diameter 80 mm minimal cracking with no open cracks and or subprime suitable for juice green open cracked fruit for some years ayars et al 2017 wang et al 2015 total yield was consistently higher in the subsurface compared to surface drip system but due to an additional 10 water being applied to the surface drip irrigation treatment to compensate for evaporative water loss and weed growth not significantly different ayars et al 2017 use of subsurface drip irrigation resulted in reduced weed pressure compared to surface drip irrigation irrigation water productivity ranged between c 5 15 and 5 58 kg m 3 for surface and between 5 97 and 6 04 kg m 3 for subsurface drip irrigation although subsurface drip irrigation systems have advantages there are also some disadvantages to take into account lamm 2002 these include wetting pattern issues on coarse soils difficulties in monitoring and evaluation of system operation and application efficiency emitter discharge rates and water redistribution disparities restricted plant root development and its role in irrigation and fertilization and crop water stresses even when the root zone is well watered in a study by ayars et al 2017 subsurface drip irrigation of pomegranate trees on a sandy loam soil required high frequency irrigation applying irrigation after 1 mm water use resulted in 10 12 irrigations per day during peak water use 3 water requirements information on water requirements of crops are needed to decide whether production of a certain crop is viable in a specific region crop water requirement is the amount of water that needs to be supplied to replace water lost through evapotranspiration water requirements of crops can be determined by direct measurement of the consumptive water use energy balance and micrometeorological methods soil water balance lysimeters or it can be estimated indirectly using mathematical models 3 1 reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for purposes of irrigation scheduling crop water requirements etc is frequently estimated according to the guidelines of fao56 allen et al 1998 using weather data based penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficients kc to calculate eto the following data are needed solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed measured at 2 m or converted to that height above an extensive surface of green grass shading the ground and not short of water the eto can be estimated for hourly daily or ten day to monthly time intervals using the appropriate calculations reference evapotranspiration can also be quantified using other less accurate models that require less extensive weather data sets meshram et al 2011 or by monitoring class a pan evaporation allen et al 1998 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 a pan factor kp is used for conversion of class a pan evaporation to eto allen et al 1998 long term meteorological data have also been used to estimate eto for some of the pomegranate irrigation research done in india meshram et al 2010a b 2011 bhagat and popale 2016 iran parvizi et al 2014 and egypt seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 although fao56 allen et al 1998 contains kc values for various crops data are not listed for pomegranate trees crop coefficients are experimentally determined ratios of etc eto and kc based on class a pan evaporation are not interchangeable with those developed using eto crop coefficients can be determined based on etc measured accurately using weighing or drainage lysimeters ayars et al 2017 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 zhang et al 2017 or etc derived from a soil water balance allen et al 1998 alternatively the pomegranate kc can be estimated from site specific empirical relationships of kc versus day of year ayars et al 2017 parvizi et al 2014 or from fractional canopy ground cover meshram et al 2010a 2011 zhang et al 2017 as indicated in fig 1 zhang et al 2017 developed different mathematical relationships between kc and fractional canopy ground cover for bushy uc kare and vase shaped usda ars pomegranate cv wonderful trees in california comparison of these pomegranate specific kc estimates to those for peach ayars et al 2003 grapevine williams and ayars 2005 and the general deciduous fruit equation used by meshram et al 2011 indicated that the pomegranate cultivar wonderful tended to have lower kc values at comparable fractional ground cover also measured as shaded area cast on the ground than these crops fig 1 the differences in slopes and intercepts of these relationships are ascribed to differences in methods used to determine etc and the shaded areas and dissimilarities in cultivation practices specifically irrigation amounts and frequencies williams and ayars 2005 for pomegranate from the sources used by this review only the kc values generated by research of ayars et al 2017 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 and zhang et al 2017 are based on lysimeter measurements those of bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 were intended for use with class a pan evaporation and are suitable for a range of irrigation water salinities between 0 8 and 8 ds m 1 the class a pan crop coefficients for non saline conditions for one year old wonderful plants were 0 16 at bud break and 0 64 at 120 days after bud break in california the maximum kc for use with penman monteith derived eto increased for subsurface drip irrigated wonderful pomegranate trees from 0 85 for four year old trees to between 1 and 1 2 for six year old trees bearing c 33 2 and 50 4 t ha 1 fruit respectively ayars et al 2017 intrigliolo et al 2011 adapted kc values based on those of bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 for spanish research conditions intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 whereas buesa et al 2012 initially used the farmer irrigation schedule and experimentally developed crop coefficients using soil water content and stem water potential measurements as calibration aid bugueño et al 2016 also based their research for young pomegranate trees on a kc value of bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 and recommended upward adjustment thereof since trunk growth rate was higher in the 130 etc compared to the 100 etc treatment martinez nicolás et al 2019 used bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 as reference to obtain kc values for seven year old mollar de elche and wonderful trees differences in phenological development between cultivars was taken into account and the control treatment was irrigated at 115 etc 3 2 crop evapotranspiration from the articles sourced for this review the only lysimeter measured daily etc data for young pomegranate orchards were available from israel bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 daily etc of one year old punica granatum l plants during 2008 ranged from 0 23 to 5 mm d 1 from bud burst to peak season the class a pan evaporation during this period ranged between c 3 1 and 9 2 mm d 1 the young tree peak water use is about half of that measured in the mediterranean climate of the central valley of california for bearing six year old wonderful pomegranate trees 10 5 mm d 1 ayars et al 2017 there were minor cultivar related differences in daily etc of the one year old wonderful and sp 2 varieties and their response to a range of irrigation water salinities between 0 8 ds m 1 and 8 ds m 1 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 salinity significantly reduced daily etc of the pomegranate plants which should be taken into account during irrigation scheduling to prevent excessive leaching the seasonal etc march to november for one year old wonderful and sp 2 plants irrigated with low salinity water in israel during 2008 was 544 mm and 557 mm respectively amounting to about a third of the 1521 mm cumulative class a pan evaporation bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 irrigation of these trees with water having salinity of 1 4 3 3 4 8 and 8 ds m 1 reduced the seasonal etc relative to that of trees irrigated with 0 8 ds m 1 water by 15 23 44 and 66 respectively in 2010 and 2012 yearly etc of one and three year old wonderful subsurface drip irrigated plants in california was c 4 c 53 mm and c 35 483 mm of the c 1263 and c 1387 mm eto respectively ayars et al 2017 the yearly etc of bearing four five and six year old trees were c 683 c 912 and c 953 mm respectively which amounted to 49 62 and 69 of the cumulative eto actual seasonal evapotranspiration of nine year old manfalouty pomegranate trees grown in sandy desert soils in the el maghara region egypt was determined by measuring soil moisture content gravimetrically seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 the etc of trees drip irrigated every second day from february to october over three years totalled c 483 mm on average with a maximum daily water use of 2 7 mm d 1 during the season the eto for the 2008 2010 seasons amounted to 1334 16 mm on average soil water balance determined seasonal evapotranspiration of six year old hicaznar pomegranate trees planted in 1 2 m deep loamy soil in turkey ranged between 775 2 and 825 6 mm during three seasons whereas the eto amounted to 751 5 34 4 dinc et al 2018 3 3 irrigation water requirement in addition to etc the irrigation water requirement takes effective rainfall into account and may include extra water to compensate for irrigation system efficiency and or for leaching of salts allen et al 1998 methods for estimation of etc and the irrigation water requirement differed widely between countries and research studies sourced for this review due to site specific differences in amongst other factors evaporative demand orchard spacing cultivars tree canopy cover soil type wetted area and irrigation water salinity however the measured amounts of irrigation water applied to well watered control treatments of drip irrigated irrigation research projects conducted in various countries in young to full bearing orchards give an indication of the variation in irrigation water requirement of pomegranate orchards fig 2 in california on fine sandy loam non bearing trees of the cultivar wonderful received 25 and 216 mm drip irrigation respectively in the first and second season ayars et al 2017 the amount increased in subsequent seasons for bearing three four five and six year old subsurface drip irrigated pomegranate trees to 427 584 780 and 843 mm of irrigation water and to 472 645 848 and 932 mm for surface drip irrigated trees of similar age in turkey irrigation applied to double line drip irrigated hicaznar trees in loamy soil amounted to 430 455 5 and 410 mm dinc et al 2018 in iran the maximum amount of irrigation applied to the pomegranate cvs shahvar and rabab on loam and fine sandy loam soils was 972 and 1214 mm respectively parvizi et al 2014 selahvarzi et al 2017 the amount of irrigation water applied to the cvs mollar de elche and wonderful in spain on sandy loam silt loam and sandy clay loam soils ranged between 392 mm and 776 mm buesa et al 2012 intrigliolo et al 2011 2012 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 peña estévez et al 2015 2016 with regard to canopy cover of these orchards no information was available for the non bearing trees in california ayars et al 2017 nor for the seven year old mollar de elche and wonderful trees from spain martínez nicolás et al 2019 however maximum canopy ground cover for the surface drip irrigated three four and five year old wonderful orchards was c 20 9 46 2 and c 81 3 respectively compared to c 21 1 51 and 85 7 for the subsurface irrigated trees zhang et al 2017 canopy cover of the shavar cultivar in iran is given as c 50 selahvarzi et al 2017 whereas the canopy diameter of rabab was 2 m in an orchard spaced 5m 4m parvizi et al 2014 the full canopy ground cover of most of the between 11 and 13 year old spanish mollar de elche orchards ranged between 48 and 56 buesa et al 2012 intrigliolo et al 2011 2012 2013 4 water use efficiency and water productivity in addition to water production functions water use efficiency and biophysical and economical water productivity indicators can assist in decision making on on farm irrigation fernández et al 2020 definitions of the terms water use efficiency and water use productivity in the research surveyed by this review was inconsistent and the terms cannot be used interchangeably between studies table 1 the water use indicator terminology for this review was therefore standardised according to fernández et al 2020 and references therein crop water use efficiency is defined as the crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 divided by the amount of water applied by irrigation and precipitation m3 ha 1 there are several options available to calculate crop water productivity kg m 3 but for the purpose of this article it is defined as yield kg ha 1 divided by crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 water productivity values calculated by using crop evapotranspiration estimated as the total of effective precipitation and irrigation as denominator is considered to be unreliable irrigation water productivity is defined as yield kg ha 1 divided by the total amount of water applied by irrigation m3 ha 1 economic crop water productivity quantifies the relation between production earnings in monetary terms and water usage economic irrigation water productivity currency unit per m3 can be calculated using the gross margin revenue accounted for variable costs net margin revenue accounted for variable and fixed costs or profit revenue accounted for variable fixed and opportunity costs per hectare divided by irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 of these the net margin or profit is considered most appropriate for decision making on profitable irrigation management of fruit tree crops fernández et al 2020 based on general agreement marketable yield is used as numerator to calculate irrigation water productivity fernández et al 2020 however for pomegranate orchards dinc et al 2018 ghosh et al 2013 khattab et al 2011 parvizi et al 2014 and seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 used total yield in calculations whereas there is not clarity whether kumar et al 2013 and martínez nicolás et al 2019 used total or marketable yield refer to comments table 1 ayars et al 2017 calculated irrigation water productivity for prime fruit destined for the fresh fruit market sub prime fruit for juicing included some green and open cracked fruit and for total yield whereas selahvarzi et al 2017 used marketable yield irrigation water productivity may be overestimated in the cases where the total yield does not represent marketable yield furthermore it was not possible to accurately define the economic crop water productivity reported by intrigliolo et al 2013 due to lack of economic analysis information higher irrigation water productivity for subsurface compared to surface drip irrigated pomegranate trees was due to higher yield and less water applied to the subsurface irrigated trees ayars et al 2017 the irrigation water productivity for four five and six year old trees was 6 04 6 1 and 5 97 kg m 3 for the subsurface drip and 5 15 5 35 and 5 58 kg m 3 for the surface drip irrigated trees deficit irrigation resulted in increasing water productivity fruit yield divided by irrigation applied rainfall of mollar de elche pomegranate trees intrigliolo et al 2013 the average increase in water productivity over three years relative to the control 3 9 kg m 3 was particularly noticeable in the sustained deficit irrigation 5 9 kg m 3 treatment and where regulated deficit irrigation was applied during flowering and fruit set 4 9 kg m 3 the sustained deficit irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments were successful in increasing water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity maintaining the yield value at similar levels to the control intrigliolo et al 2013 however there was a definite impact of sustained deficit irrigation on fruit size and consequently on farmer income more recently martinez nicolás et al 2019 confirmed that withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set for the cvs mollar de elche and wonderful improved irrigation water productivity by c 14 5 and c 10 on average over two seasons compared to where full irrigation was applied irrigation water productivity 5 6 and 7 1 kg m 3 for the respective cultivars irrigation water productivity increased due to water savings with no significant effect of deficit irrigation on marketable yield deficit irrigation applied at 75 etc and 50 etc increased irrigation water productivity of the cv rabab by 15 and c 27 respectively on average over two seasons compared to trees irrigated at 100 etc irrigation water productivity 4 2 kg m 3 parvizi et al 2014 however partial rootzone drying strategies applied at these respective etc levels over the same period increased the irrigation water productivity on average by 38 and c 51 compared to the fully irrigated trees parvizi et al 2014 the increased irrigation water productivity of the 75 etc partial rootzone drying strategy was mainly due to increased fruit number comparable fruit weight and 22 less water use relative to the fully irrigated trees for the 50 etc partial rootzone drying strategy a c 16 yield loss and almost 45 decrease in irrigation water use relative to the trees irrigated at 100 etc resulted in the huge relative increase in irrigation water productivity poorer relative irrigation water productivity at the deficit irrigated trees compared to the partial root zone irrigated trees at both etc levels can be attributed to greater yield losses 11 and 30 at the 75 etc and 50 etc levels respectively irrigating only one side of the root zone at a four day interval throughout the season reduced fruit number and size per tree to greater extent compared to where irrigation was alternated between two sides of the root zone in the first and second season a regulated deficit irrigation strategy no irrigation until end fruit set 100 etc remainder of season applied to seven year old shavar pomegranate trees in iran selahvarzi et al 2017 increased irrigation water productivity relative to the control 2 15 and 2 45 kg m 3 by c 50 and 39 respectively the higher irrigation water productivity was mainly ascribed to a c 18 irrigation water saving as yield tended to be but was not significantly lower relative to the control although the sustained deficit irrigation treatment increased irrigation water productivity in the first season by c 59 compared to the control the detrimental long term effect of severe water deficits on trees reduced the irrigation water productivity of the sustained deficit irrigation strategy in the second season to levels similar to those of the control the irrigation water productivity of 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees in egypt was calculated as yield divided by the scheduled amount of water per treatment khattab et al 2011 the treatment receiving 520 mm water per season had the highest irrigation water productivity i e 3 22 and 2 91 kg m 3 water applied the irrigation water productivity decreased significantly when less or more than 520 mm water was applied the underlying reason for this trend may be water stress related yield decreases in the drier treatments and inefficient water use in the wetter treatment in turkey differences in crop water productivity of several irrigation treatments including sustained deficit irrigation treatments were not statistically significant dinc et al 2018 during three seasons crop water productivity ranged between 2 8 and 4 6 kg m 3 irrigation water productivity ranged between 5 95 and 10 66 kg m 3 for a high value crop such as pomegranate crop water productivity and irrigation water productivity values should be interpreted carefully as they do not reflect the effect of water use on yield and fruit quality combined which determines farmer profit at the end of the day for this purpose the use of economic crop water productivity or economic irrigation water productivity is highly recommended for decision making regarding selection of suitable irrigation strategies taking into account the specific production target fernández et al 2020 5 water management strategies under limited water supply water stress can be induced deliberately in fruit trees by withholding irrigation or by applying less water than plants require for maximum evapotranspiration a method called regulated deficit irrigation mitchell et al 1984 the effect of irrigation strategies on trees may differ depending on the timing and level of the water deficit applied the duration thereof the climatic conditions of the area and the drought tolerance of the crop via avoidance and tolerance mechanisms where irrigation water is a limited or costly resource well managed deficit irrigation improves both water productivity and producer profitability as compared to full irrigation fernández et al 2020 and references therein in selection of suitable irrigation strategies the producer should focus on environmentally sustainable methods that optimise yield over the long term and on production targets e g fresh fruit juice pharmaceuticals cosmetics wine that maximise profit for a specific orchard 5 1 irrigation management selected research regarding irrigation strategies for mollar de elche pomegranate trees and advantages and disadvantages of the strategies are listed in tables 2 and 3 water savings relative to a well watered control ranged between c 14 and 100 for a range of experimental periods pertaining to the different studies irrigation strategies that did not affect yield negatively and maintained or improved marketability relative to well watered trees saved between 14 1 and 29 irrigation water galindo et al 2014b 2017a intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 to evaluate the suitability of a specific irrigation strategy knowledge is required regarding the effect of water deficits on crop growth during different phenological stages studies that focussed specifically on the effect of water deficits during linear fruit growth and or ripening of the cultivar mollar de elche include that of cano lamadrid et al 2018 galindo et al 2014a b 2017a and mellisho et al 2012 however the effect of sustained deficit irrigation mena et al 2013 intrigliolo et al 2013 and regulated deficit irrigation at different phenological stages intrigliolo et al 2013 martínez nicolás et al 2019 on the performance of the cultivar was evaluated as well fruit ripening is a critical period for the cv mollar de elche as irrigation is required during most of this phenological period to achieve maximum yield galindo et al 2017a however withholding water for six days before harvest saved 14 water relative to well watered trees while it increased fruit peel colour and enhanced bioactive compound content with no negative impact on marketable yield 37 1 t ha 1 or fruit size table 2 advanced harvest time may result in earlier market access and improved fruit prices for producers interested in the processing market red colour of juice improved whereas fruit size at harvest decreased by c 14 when water was withheld for 25 and 34 days before harvest using 62 and 100 less water compared to the well watered trees total yield decreased by c 8 and 23 for these two scenarios and marketable yield by 49 and 69 according to peña estévez et al 2015 withholding water from 16 and 26 days before harvest saved c 6 and 11 water and increased shelf life of arils by 4 days compared to a well watered control arils from deficit irrigated fruit had better visual appearance and overall quality but had lower anthocyanin content and a slightly red orange colour the total soluble solids where water was withheld for 26 days was slightly higher whereas there was no effect relative to the control where water was withheld for 16 days in contrast to the findings of galindo et al 2017a intrigliolo et al 2013 found that 25 etc regulated deficit irrigation applied during ripening to mollar de elche trees did not affect yield fruit number fruit weight or economic yield value whereas the strategies saved 18 of water and tended to have increased economic irrigation water productivity relative to the control table 3 furthermore fruit had higher levels of total soluble solids at harvest and throughout 8 and 19 weeks cold storage enhanced red peel colour and more anthocyanins in juice after 8 and 19 weeks cold storage compared to well watered trees less external physiological disorders and fruit weight loss occurred after 19 weeks storage and a seven day shelf life period regulated deficit irrigation applied during ripening though may result in increased fruit cracking in some seasons the differences in the outcomes of this research regarding regulated deficit irrigation during ripening compared to that of galindo et al 2014b 2017a may be partially explained by differences in crop load c 49 lower yield for well watered trees less water stress that developed and the fact that irrigation was applied six to seven times a week during summer and weekly during autumn intrigliolo et al 2013 amongst the sustained deficit irrigation and various regulated deficit irrigation treatments the best strategy for mollar de elche was 25 etc application only during the main flower and reproductive organs drop period with 100 etc applied during the rest of the season intrigliolo et al 2013 this strategy saved c 12 water relative to the 100 etc treatment and increased yield via more fruit of slightly lower weight table 3 water deficits did not affect the fruit total soluble solids the economic yield value was not affected but crop water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity increased relative to the control external physiological disorders after cold storage was less compared to the control disadvantages of this strategy are that it decreased the maturity index at harvest and had no positive effect on the juice anthocyanins or antioxidant capacity for the cvs mollar de elche and wonderful the flowering and fruit set phenological phase can be considered non critical because sensitivity to water stress during this period was low martinez nicolás et al 2019 under the conditions of the study withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set saved between 19 and 30 irrigation water with no detrimental effect on marketable yield fruit size or chemical composition tables 2 and 4 a regulated deficit irrigation strategy applying 25 etc during the linear fruit growth period reduced fruit weight by only c 6 and saved 24 of water relative to the control intrigliolo et al 2013 table 3 this strategy had no effect on the economic yield value but increased economic irrigation water productivity juice total soluble solids compared to the control increased after 19 weeks storage and seven days shelf life although the maturity index was lower at harvest juice anthocyanins at harvest and notably after 8 and 19 weeks of storage and shelf life period increased relative to the control fruit irrigated according to this strategy may in some seasons be susceptible to cracking although 50 etc applied for three years during the entire growing season sustained deficit irrigation saved 44 water relative to the 100 etc treatment it had no negative impact on yield in the mediterranean area of southeastern spain table 3 over three years trees were on average bearing c 28 more fruit of c 22 lower weight which decreased the economic yield value relative to the control by 28 table 3 intrigliolo et al 2013 red fruit peel colour was enhanced at harvest and throughout cold storage and shelf life but turned yellowish at the end of storage and shelf life despite the latter fruit were still more red than those of the other irrigation treatments laribi et al 2013 juice anthocyanins increased notably relative to the control after 19 weeks of storage and the following shelf life period taking the smaller fruit size and marketability thereof into account the sustained deficit irrigation strategy may be more suitable for producers targeting the juice industry intrigliolo et al 2013 fruit had less external physiological disorders and aril browning and less fruit weight loss after cold storage and shelf life compared to a well watered control furthermore the sustained deficit irrigation reduced vegetative growth markedly which may affect tree productivity in the long term especially if trees are still young intrigliolo et al 2013 when the strategy is imposed fruit of trees subjected to the sustained deficit irrigation strategy may in some seasons also be prone to increased sunburn compared to well watered trees of all the irrigation strategies evaluated in this research sustained deficit irrigation increased water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity the most relative to the control according to bartual et al 2015a sustained deficit irrigation and to a lesser extent 25 etc regulated deficit irrigation during ripening could be used as tools to accelerate the fruit ripening date of mollar de elche fruit due to faster sugar accumulation this has important implications for marketing pomegranate fruit the red coloration and higher sugar content may advance harvest time if the cultivar is picked according to external coloration with the prospect to fetch better prices if you can get in the market earlier laribi et al 2013 with regard to the cultivar wonderful 75 etc sustained deficit irrigation increased yield relative to trees irrigated at 100 etc in the third year that deficit irrigation was applied zhang et al 2017 however there is a paucity of data regarding quality of the fruit and the exact amount of water applied table 4 indications during the second year of deficit irrigation were that sustained deficit irrigation at 35 etc may have a detrimental effect on fruit colour centofanti et al 2017 irrigation at 60 etc during fruit growth and ripening also had a detrimental effect on fruit juice colour and reduced yield by 41 cano lamadrid et al 2018 whereas applying 100 etc to only one side instead of to the full root zone may reduce incidence of cracking noitsakis et al 2016 research from iran for the cv rabab indicated positive effects of 75 etc partial rootzone drying on yield and juice content with c 22 water saved relative to a well watered control parvizi et al 2014 2016 this irrigation strategy increased irrigation water productivity significantly compared to a well irrigated control and trees deficit irrigated at 75 and 50 etc on one side of the root zone only table 5 one has to keep in mind though that the partial rootzone drying strategy can increase labour or irrigation system costs in contrast to the findings of noitsakis et al 2016 regarding cracking for the cv wonderful fruit cracking increased for rabab relative to a well watered control where irrigation was applied at 75 or 50 etc to one side of the root zone also in iran for the cultivar shavar no irrigation applied from the beginning of the season until fruit set followed by irrigation at 100 etc during the remainder of the season resulted in reduced vegetative growth with a compact flowering period improved fruit set and weight with no effect on yield and increased total phenolic compounds compared to the control table 5 selahvarzi et al 2017 on the contrary sustained deficit irrigation applied at 50 etc decreased yield and had negative carry over effects on vegetative growth and flowering in the second season although fruit juice had higher total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity compared to the control the regulated deficit irrigation strategy applied c 18 less water compared to the control and the sustained deficit irrigation strategy 50 less both strategies had higher irrigation water productivity compared to the control treatment in the first season but were comparable to well watered trees in the second based on the currently sourced research tables 2 5 sustained deficit irrigation may supply a market for smaller pomegranates with increased red peel and or juice however a sustained deficit irrigation strategy applying 50 etc or less in dry and arid regions may in most cases not be sustainable and cannot be recommended over the long term for profitable pomegranate production in this regard more research addressing the carry over effects of water deficits on vegetative growth and reproductive bud development between seasons is needed 5 2 orchard management in egypt etc decreased and yield progressively increased as the drip irrigation interval for manfalouty trees in fine sandy soils increased from 2 to 4 to 6 days seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 according to seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 and references therein the highest pomegranate yield is obtained when the soil reaches 60 or 40 of field capacity between irrigations young ganesh trees achieved maximum yield where 40 of evaporated water was replaced while application of more water promoted competition between vegetative and fruit growth which decreased yield afria et al 1998 application of olive pomace mulch decreased etc compared to no mulch weeds or petroleum applied as bitumen emulsion mulch seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 olive pomace mulched trees had the highest yield followed by the bitumen emulsion mulched trees with the lowest yield in trees with no mulch irrespective of mulching treatment yield increased as irrigation interval increased fig 3 yield increases relative to the crop without mulch ranged between 12 and 40 for the bitumen emulsion mulch and between 35 and 101 for the olive pomace mulch the positive effect of the olive pomace mulch may be associated with pronounced increases in soil temperature which may increase both water and nutrient consumption by tree roots which in turn affect the crop yield the highest crop water productivity was obtained for a combination of a 6 day irrigation interval and olive pomace mulch the crop water productivity increased as trees aged and it amounted to 5 55 5 59 and 5 65 kg m 3 for three respective seasons similarly the irrigation water productivity equalled 4 14 4 31 and 4 49 kg m 3 during the three seasons the positive effect of mulches on pomegranate fruit yield have been reported previously whereas mulching also reduced fruit cracking seidhom and abd el rahman and references therein 2011 however straw mulching in drip irrigated pomegranates did not improve crop water productivity but ineffectiveness of mulch treatments was attributed to water infiltration problems especially during dry months ghosh et al 2013 use of new mulches for soil water conservation in arid regions has been introduced as an alternative to conventional plastic mulches farzi et al 2017 different mulch materials differed in soil water conservation efficiency and reduced evaporation relative to bare soil by between 35 and 63 de oiled olive pomace mulch and pistachio shell mulch as new mulch materials seems more favourable for conserving soil water compared to the other materials fig 4 makus et al 2014 found in row durable white plastic to be beneficial to retain soil water reduce chemical weed control required increase total fruit yield by c 20 and improve juice colour white plastic improved midday orchard floor reflectance reduced surface temperatures and decreased variability in soil temperatures at several depths up to 300 mm deep white plastic had no significant effect on fruit peel colour trees grown under white plastic mulch had more basal sucker production at the end of the season whereas irrigation rate also increased sucker frequency and size 6 conclusions to be able to farm water efficient profitable and sustainable currently remains a challenge for pomegranate producers although biophysical and economic water productivity indicators may be useful in on farm irrigation decision making reliable crop evapotranspiration information for the calculation of these indicators is not readily available to farmers to determine orchard crop evapotranspiration accurately is complex and expensive for the moment the use of irrigation water productivity and economic irrigation water productivity that takes into account the costs involved in perennial fruit crop production and the specific markets targeted appears to be a more viable approach further research is required to provide the necessary information to improve irrigation management and as such support sustainable farming amidst climate change i e higher temperatures changing rainfall patterns and increasingly limited water resources with regard to irrigation scheduling crop coefficients developed for different irrigation systems and different cultivars in different countries cannot necessarily be applied directly elsewhere it will be very useful if the water use transpiration and evapotranspiration of a range of young to full bearing pomegranate orchards is quantified accurately with the purpose of developing a model for practical estimation of crop coefficients under local conditions such a model covering a range of fractional light interception regimes could enable extrapolation of the study findings to other orchards in other production areas splitting the orchard crop coefficient into a separate transpiration and soil evaporation coefficient may enable a more accurate estimate of orchard water use such a model will aid producers to schedule irrigation according to tree water requirements and prevent over or under irrigation which impacts the environment leaching of fertilizers and water losses and fruit tree performance yield and quality with regard to irrigation strategies variable results with different systems and different cultivars in different countries clearly indicate that results from one study

10498,an integrated research coupling a field study with an agronomic economic model answer app was conducted to investigate the combined effects of irrigation levels and crop loads on fruit quality water productivity and profitability of mature date palms the study took place in israel s hyper arid arava valley where date palm trees are widely cultivated and rely exclusively on brackish water irrigation three fruit load intensities low fl1 commercial fl2 high fl3 and two irrigation levels w1 and w2 equal to and higher than the local irrigation regime respectively were applied in a 22 year old date palm orchard in 2018 2019 irrigation amount fruit quality and yield were measured profitability for each treatment was analyzed with the answer app higher fruit load resulted in higher yield and water productivity but on the other hand led to reduced fruit physical properties size and mass regardless of the irrigation treatment the improved fruit physical properties and net profits in w2 compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group resulted from excess salt leaching in the root zone notably trees under w2fl2 treatment were found to have highest net profits it is concluded that adequate irrigation amounts contribute to net profits in date palm trees treated with high fruit load intensity under saline irrigation conditions keywords crop load irrigation scheduling agronomic economic model salinity yield 1 introduction date palm trees are widely grown in israel s hyper arid arava valley where the annual average evaporation class a pan and yearly rainfall are 3200 mm and 25 mm respectively tripler et al 2011 cohen and glasner 2015 hence the sustainable cultivation of date palm trees in this region relies exclusively on high frequency irrigation the main water source for palm irrigation in the hyper arid region is from saline groundwater with an electrical conductivity ec greater than 2 5 ds m 1 tripler et al 2011 al muaini et al 2019b saline irrigation leads to the reduction of vegetative growth and fruit production in palm trees due to salinity stress tripler et al 2011 sperling et al 2014 ait el mokhtar et al 2019 serret et al 2020 nevertheless the cultivation of date palms in the arava valley is still profitable due to increasing demand encouraging local farmers to continuously expand their orchards for more fruit production chao and krueger 2007 al khayri et al 2015 the net cultivation profit is calculated by the difference between economic inputs cost for labor machinery fertigation and management etc and commercial outputs income of selling dates gross revenue is determined by both fruit yield and quality fereres and soriano 2007 rey et al 2016 lopez et al 2018 as harvested dates are divided into different categories for different sale prices based on fruit quality mainly size and mass fruit thinning is a common practice to reduce the fruit load intensity after fruit set in fruiting trees for the purpose of regulating fruit quality dennis 2000 link 2000 previous studies show that higher fruit size and mass were achieved in peach berman and dejong 1996 orange syvertsen et al 2003 apple naor et al 2008 and persimmon choi et al 2010 trees with lower fruit load high quality fruit contributed to net profits but only partially on the other hand low fruit load in fruiting trees resulted in low yield trentacoste et al 2010 cohen and glasner 2015 samuolienė et al 2016 currently the amount of irrigation water applied in date palm orchards is based on a fixed table of the recommended irrigation regime in the arava valley without respect to fruit load this irrigation regime was previously determined through the product of the reference evapotranspiration times an empirical crop factor varying from 0 5 to 1 sperling 2013 therefore annual irrigation amount is maintained moderately steady leading to relatively stable economic inputs for date palm cultivation consequently low yield resulting from low fruit load reduces water productivity m l 3 which is herein defined as the fruit production per annual irrigation amount applied to date palms al muaini et al 2019c in order to substantially increase net cultivation profits fruit quality and yield of date palm trees have to be well balanced by proper fruit thinning under the current irrigation regime other than fruit load irrigation amount also plays a critical role in the yield of fruiting trees ruiz sanchez et al 2010 crop yield was found to be well correlated with crop transpiration during the growing season de wit 1958d hanks 1974 generally increased irrigation amount leads to higher crop yield to some extent by improving crop evapotranspiration steduto et al 2012 increased yield was reported in olive moriana et al 2003 apple naor et al 2008 almond egea et al 2010 and plum intrigliolo et al 2013 trees under well irrigated conditions compared to deficit irrigation in addition the presence of salts in irrigation water constrains root water uptake by decreasing soil water osmotic pressure further restricting crop yield production bernstein 1975 solomon 1985 negrão et al 2017 in order to mitigate adverse effects of salinity on crop growth soil salinity leaching is usually required by applying excess irrigation water to the root zone shalhevet 1994 levy and syvertsen 2004 letey et al 2011 al muaini et al 2019a this could alleviate soil water osmotic stress by promoting the removal of accumulated salts in the root zone and facilitate crop root water uptake for growth and production ayers and westcot 1985 paranychianakis and chartzoulakis 2005 in date palms tripler et al 2011 reported the reduction of both leaf development and yield in trees subjected to long term application of irrigation water with high salinity these reductions were primarily attributed to photosynthetic assimilation rate decrease due to reduced stomatal conductance associated with restricted root water uptake under osmotic stress condition sperling et al 2014 meanwhile date palms were found to mostly exclude toxic ions mainly na from the sensitive photosynthetic tissues of the leaflet suggesting no permanent damage or efficiency loss in the photosynthetic system sperling 2013 this finding implied the potential of increased date palm photosynthetic assimilation for growth by applying supplemental irrigation water in order to control root zone salinity level especially during the fruit growing season additionally there were no significant differences in fruit size and mass of palm trees irrigated with the salinity levels of 1 8 and 4 0 ds m 1 as fruit load was adjusted based on the canopy size tripler et al 2011 these similar fruit physical properties probably suggested the interplay between fruit load and root zone salinity consequently the fruit size and mass may be improved in date palms with high fruit load under low root zone salinity condition resulting from salt leaching by supplemental irrigation the cost of extra water for leaching requirement may be highly compensated by increased fruit quality and yield thus well balanced fruit quality and yield may be achieved by proper fruit thinning and supplemental irrigation for maximum net profits this study addresses two hypotheses 1 fruit quality and yield will be improved in date palms with increased irrigation application due to salt leaching in the root zone and 2 optimal net profits will be achieved in date palm trees with well balanced fruit load intensity and irrigation level during the fruit growing season therefore the objective of this study was to investigate effects of combined fruit load intensity and irrigation level on date palm fruit quality water productivity and net profits 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and trees the experiment was carried out in a 22 year old date palm orchard located in israel s central arava valley 30 48 35 5 n 35 16 16 5 e 130 m below sea level detailed climate information of the central arava valley was previously described by zhen et al 2019 the selected experimental plot in the orchard has 242 date palm trees phoenix dactylifera l cv medjool planted in 2002 with a growing space of 9 m by 9 m the plot was divided into 24 groups of nine trees fig s1 the center tree in each group was chosen for the experiment with the rest as the margin twenty four experimental trees were 9 m high with a trunk diameter of 0 6 m they were irrigated two emitters per tree with discharge rate of 37 l h 1 naandanjain israel according to the local irrigation practice fertilizer solution containing 21 ammonium nitrate was proportionally injected to the irrigation water to maintain 60 ppm of n 2 2 treatment application three fruit load intensities and two irrigation levels were jointly applied for two consecutive years 2018 2019 with four repetitions in each treatment fig s1 each group was randomly selected for different extents of fruit thinning trees within the same group received same treatments of fruit load intensity and irrigation level each date palm tree had 27 fruit bunches and each fruit bunch had 35 40 spikelets fruit load intensities were set by controlling the fruitlet number in the spikelet of the fruit bunch low fl1 commercial fl2 and high fl3 fruit load intensities corresponded to 7 10 and 15 fruitlets in the spikelet respectively fruit thinning was conducted from 1st to 7th may 2018 and also during the period of 29th april to 8th may 2019 different irrigation level w1 and w2 equal to and higher than the local irrigation practice respectively was applied in each block fig s2 the yearly irrigation ratio of w2 over w1 was set to 1 10 and 1 25 in 2018 and in 2019 respectively hence there were in total six treatments w1fl1 w1fl2 w1fl3 w2fl1 w2fl2 and w2fl3 2 3 field and laboratory measurement in early may twenty four experimental trees were trimmed to have same number of leaves 108 in 2018 and 145 in 2019 before the onset of fruit load treatments these trees were further pruned in order to have same number of 80 leaves in mid june 2019 irrigation amount was continuously measured by water meters sf15 arad israel in both irrigation levels with three repetitions one repetition per fruit load treatment in each irrigation level in 2018 2019 all water meters were connected to data loggers cr10 campbell scientific logan ut usa collecting data every 15 min the electrical conductivity of irrigation water which contains fertilizer was measured once a month and was 2 4 0 4 ds m 1 throughout the experiment solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were monitored by a nearby meteorological station in yair experimental station 30 46 45 3 n 35 14 31 1 e for the reference evapotranspiration et0 calculation based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 zhen et al 2019 subsequently the potential evapotranspiration etp of date palm was determined by multiplying et0 by an empirical crop factor of 0 89 sperling 2013 average daily etp in 2018 2019 was further calculated for the water demand input in an analytical model the hourly temperature sum tsum for each year for a given time t is calculated as 1 t s u m i 1 t t i where i 1 denotes 01 00 on doy 1 and ti c is hourly air temperature fruitlets were sampled from each experimental tree every 2 3 weeks during the period between may and august fruitlet length width and mass were determined with approaches previously specified by zhen et al 2019 harvest was carried out three times according to fruit ripening stages from early august to early september in 2018 and from late august to mid october in 2019 total yield of each experimental tree was recorded for water productivity calculation harvested fruitlets dates were sampled for mass assessment and further for total number calculation for both seasons 2 4 profitability analysis the answer is an analytical model that computes yield and water use under various combined levels of irrigation and salinity shani et al 2007 2009 specifically evapotranspiration calculation considers soil hydraulic properties climate applied irrigation quantity and quality and crop response to salinity the average daily etp for the whole year governs crop water demand the model assumes a steady state condition of water and salinity in both irrigation and soil the average daily evapotranspiration et mm day 1 is calculated by the following equation 2 e t min e t p ψ r o o t ψ w a t e r i e t k s 1 η i e t b 1 e c i i θ r θ s θ r i e t k s 1 δ e c 50 i e t θ s p where etp mm day 1 is the average daily potential evapotranspiration i mm day 1 is the average daily irrigation amount ψroot mm is the minimum water head at the root soil interface for an optimal water

is the residual soil water content and θs is the saturated soil water content the yield is then calculated assuming a proportional relationship between relative yield yr and relative evapotranspiration etr expressed according to hanks 1974 as follows 3 y r y y p e t e t p e t r where y and yp m l 2 are actual and potential yield production respectively later on the answer app available at app agri gov il answerapp was developed by integrating answer with agronomic economic indices kaner et al 2017 2019 specifically crop response to irrigation level and salinity is coupled with the water quote pattern and the crop s financial balance the answer app was chosen for this study because it directly solves for net profits under user defined agronomic economic environmental considerations notably the net profit calculation follows common economic principles in the answer app we used the option for various water quotes under different salinities and seasonal water quotation as specifically applied in israel kaner et al 2017 calculation is conducted for one season in a 1 ha date palm orchard the yield is the product of the maximum yield times the relative yield computed in answer the direct income is a multiplication of the specific selling price with the yield economic inputs are calculated as the sum of irrigation cost fixed cost such as machinery labor fertilizer pesticide and management etc and total yield dependent cost related to fruit thinning efficiency commercial outputs are calculated as the sum of annual return on investment and total revenue average price for marketed produce based on fruit class expected net profits are then calculated by the difference between economic inputs and commercial outputs in the application in answer app we utilized crop and soil parameters of shani et al 2007 specified in table 1 then relative yield was calculated for date palm trees with varying daily irrigation rates ranging from 0 5 11 mm day 1 under salinity of 2 4 ds m 1 the maximum yield of date palms was previously reported to be 220 kg per tree pevzner 2015 which was used for yield calculation consequently expected net profits based on both fruit quality and calculated yield were simulated by incorporating economic parameters which are specified in table 2 net profits were determined by scaling the expected net profits with the ratio of measured yield over calculated yield mean yearly net profits in 2018 2019 were then obtained 2 5 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed using irrigation level and fruit load intensity as two factors in spss ibm software development armonk ny usa statistical differences among treatments were later analyzed by student s t test and standard deviations presented by error bars were calculated in microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa usa p 0 05 was used to statistically indicate significant differences 3 results 3 1 climate and irrigation in this study hourly temperature sum difference between two seasons tsum 2018 tsum 2019 started to continuously increase since day of year doy 42 and peaked to the value of 4684 c on doy 115 fig s3 during this period the mean hourly temperature was found to be 2 6 c lower in 2019 than that in 2018 cumulative etp and irrigation amounts are shown in fig 1 two year cumulative etp was 3395 mm equivalent to 4 65 mm day 1 on average yearly irrigation amounts in w1 treatment were 2234 mm equivalent to 6 1 mm day 1 and 1976 mm equivalent to 5 4 mm day 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively meanwhile w2 treatment received stable yearly irrigation amount of 2442 mm equivalent to 6 7 mm day 1 thus the relative irrigation the ratio of mean irrigation rate over the potential evapotranspiration irri etp for w1 was 1 31 in 2018 and 1 16 in 2019 and 1 44 for w2 each year 3 2 fruit and yield fruit load intensity affected fruitlet mass yield fruitlet number water productivity and water use per fruitlet wupf in both years table 3 as for the irrigation level it affected only fruitlet mass in 2018 and all the aforementioned variables except for yield in 2019 however no interactive effect of irrigation level and fruit load intensity was found single fruitlet mass of harvested dates was found to be higher in 2019 than in 2018 in each treatment fig 2 a increasing fruit load resulted in decreasing date mass trees treated with fl3 exhibited lowest date mass than those in other fruit load groups while no significant differences of date mass were found between trees treated with fl1 and with fl2 under each irrigation treatment each year as for the irrigation treatment w2 treatment increased date mass compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group each year in addition trees under w2fl3 treatment showed similar date mass compared to those under w1fl2 treatment for two consecutive years maximum and minimum harvested date mass were found in trees under w2fl1 treatment in 2019 and under w1fl3 treatment in 2018 with the mean values of 26 5 g and 15 2 g respectively the aforementioned differences in date mass among treatments were consistent with differences in fruitlet size and mass measured in august each year table s1 and s2 date palm trees exhibited yield increment in 2019 compared to those in 2018 in each treatment fig 2b additionally fruit load intensity played a crucial role in yield increment trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 were found to have higher yield than those treated with fl1 under each irrigation treatment in 2018 and in 2019 nevertheless there were no significant yield differences between trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 under each irrigation treatment in each season except for trees under w1 treatment in 2018 as for the irrigation treatment w2 treatment did not pronouncedly increase yield compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group each year except for trees treated with fl2 in 2018 trees under w1fl3 and w2fl3 treatments had higher yield than those under w1fl2 treatment in 2018 notably trees under w2fl1 treatment showed non significant yield differences compared to those under w1fl2 treatment in 2018 for the two year experiment maximum yield was found in one tree under w2fl3 treatment to be 225 6 kg in 2019 in addition the lowest yield was found in trees under w1fl1 treatment in 2018 with the mean value of 81 6 kg the number of harvested fruitlets in each treatment remained relatively stable during the two year experiment fig 2c higher crop load increased fruitlet number in date palm trees under each irrigation treatment in each season on the other hand increasing irrigation amount resulted in decreasing fruitlet number in each fruit load group each year however noticeable fruitlet number differences between two irrigation treatments were only found in trees treated with fl3 throughout the experiment yearly and two year in 2018 2019 water productivity were improved with the increasing fruit load in each irrigation treatment fig 3 a trees treated with fl2 or fl3 exhibited higher water productivity than those treated with fl1 in each irrigation treatment within each period meanwhile there were no significant differences of water productivity between trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 in w1 treatment in 2019 and in w2 treatment within each period as for the irrigation treatment w2 treatment reduced water productivity only in trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 in 2019 and also with fl3 in 2018 2019 compared to w1 treatment in 2018 2019 lowest and highest water productivity were 0 464 kg m 3 and 0 943 kg m 3 in trees under w2fl1 and w1fl3 treatments respectively water use per fruitlet was derived based on calculated yearly water productivity and measured fruitlet mass fig 3b it decreased with increasing fruit load in each irrigation treatment except for between trees under w2fl2 and w2fl3 treatments in 2018 conversely wupf increased with elevated irrigation in each fruit load group each year with no remarkable differences in trees treated with fl1 each year and with fl2 in 2018 respectively in addition trees under w2fl3 treatment did not exhibit pronounced wupf differences compared to w1fl2 each year maximum and minimum wupf values were 54 1 l and 17 3 l in trees under w2fl1 and w1fl3 treatments respectively meanwhile trees under w2fl2 treatment showed a similar wupf for two consecutive years with the value of 30 9 l 3 3 net profits simulation outputs from answer app showed that the relative yield of date palm increased from 0 749 to 0 890 by increasing relative irrigation from 1 0 1 44 under irrigation ec of 2 4 ds m 1 fig 4 a the regular irrigation treatment w1 had a relative yield of 0 862 in 2018 and 0 816 in 2019 while w2 treatment had a similar relative yield of 0 89 for two consecutive years in addition mean yearly net profits in 2018 2019 considering both fruit quality and yield are presented in fig 4b trees treated with fl2 and with fl1 exhibited highest and lowest net profits respectively in each irrigation treatment as for the irrigation level w2 treatment increased net profits compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group maximum mean yearly net profits were found in trees under w2fl2 treatment with the value of 73 731 usd ha 1 notably trees under w2fl3 treatment showed higher net profits with the value of 65 837 usd ha 1 than those under w1fl2 treatment with the value of 64 322 usd ha 1 as w1fl2 treatment is that currently applied for commercial date palm production 4 discussion in this study we investigated both agronomic and economic consequences of crop load and irrigation levels with saline water quality fruit load intensity and irrigation level affected fruit quality and water productivity of date palm trees in the arava valley with saline water resources according to field measurements subsequently the interaction between fruit quality and yield played a crucial role in net cultivation profits based on answer app simulations better understanding of these effects will be helpful in applying well balanced fruit load intensity and irrigation level for optimal net profits under saline irrigation conditions both single fruitlet mass and yield of date palm trees were improved in 2019 compared to those in 2018 under each treatment probably due to low hourly temperature sum during flowering and early fruiting period in 2019 delayed onset of bud initiation in apple trees was reported to be driven by insufficient heat accumulation rather than by day length and the rate of bud initiation was not affected by crop load kofler et al 2019 in addition yield reduction in maize under warmer conditions compared to a normal temperature regime was found due to increased rate of phenological development hatfield and prueger 2015 in this study the final harvest in 2019 was completed around 1 5 months later than that in 2018 therefore moderated phenological development rate and prolonged fruit growing season of date palm trees led to higher single fruitlet mass and yield in 2019 compared to those in 2018 in each treatment differences in fruitlet size were similar to those found in fruitlet mass among treatments and fruitlet size was reported to be relatively stable from the onset of sugar accumulation until the harvest zhen et al 2019 therefore the fruit quality is solely governed by fruitlet mass single fruitlet mass was reduced by increasing fruit load in each irrigation treatment consistent with findings in peach berman and dejong 1996 orange syvertsen et al 2003 apple naor et al 2008 and persimmon choi et al 2010 trees reduced fruitlet mass resulted from constrained carbohydrate availability to each fruitlet in the tree under high fruit load condition link 2000 génard et al 2008 serra et al 2016 on the other hand increasing fruit load resulted in higher yield in each irrigation treatment most likely due to enhanced gas exchanges zhen et al 2019 previously showed that both stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation rates were significantly higher in fruiting date palm trees compared to those without fruit from the onset of fruit development until post harvest period higher gas exchanges were also reported in avocado schaffer et al 1987 plum gucci et al 1991 and apple wünsche et al 2005 due to the presence of high fruit load thus enhanced gas exchanges for transpiration and assimilation contributed to yield increment in accordance with previous studies in olive trentacoste et al 2010 naor et al 2013 bustan et al 2016 date palm cohen and glasner 2015 and apples samuolienė et al 2016 elevated irrigation levels increased fruitlet mass compared to regular irrigation in each fruit load group we suggest that the higher irrigation level especially during the fruit growing season improved root water uptake by increased salt leaching from the root zone and hence allowed for optimal gas exchanges it was found by tripler et al 2011 that both vegetative and reproductive growth were higher in palms irrigated with lower ec water in addition sperling et al 2014 reported higher stomatal conductance assimilation rates and growth in date palm trees under low salinity condition compared to those at high salinities thus the increased fruitlet mass is mainly attributed to lower root zone salinity leading to more carbohydrates available to fruit growth under w2 regime notably a similar fruitlet mass was found between w1fl2 and w2fl3 treatments although fruit load and irrigation level did not show interactive effects on it this finding suggested a trade off effect of high fruit load and low soil salinity on fruit quality consistent with similar mean fruit mass between low and high irrigation fruit load treatments in apple trees naor et al 2008 the current study proved the feasibility of achieving commercial fruit quality by reducing root zone salinity stress under high fruit load conditions as for the increased irrigation level it did not lead to significant yield increase in trees in comparison with those under w1 treatment in each fruit load group according to fruitlet number after the harvest fig 2c lower value was found in trees under w2 treatment indicating excessive fruitlet drop during the fruit growing season compared to those under w1 treatment excessive fruitlet drop most likely resulted from limited growing space along the spikelet as fruitlet mass closely related to size was higher in trees under w2 treatment than in those under w1 treatment in each fruit load group this speculation was well upheld by a remarkably lower fruitlet number in trees treated with fl3 under w2 treatment compared to those under w1 treatment as w2fl3 trees showed significantly higher fruitlet mass and size than w1fl3 trees in both years in addition spreer et al 2009 documented higher fruit drop rate in pomegranate trees under well irrigated conditions compared to deficit irrigation as for date palm trees regular irrigation was reported to cause higher bunch drop than deficit irrigation implying indirect effects of high irrigation level on fruit growth cohen et al 2010 consequently elevated irrigation levels in the present study can partially explain fruitlet drop in date palms therefore the potential of yield increase would probably be achieved by providing non limited fruitlet growing space during the fruit thinning process water productivity was apparently improved by increasing fruit load accompanied with higher yield of date palm trees in each irrigation treatment conversely elevated irrigation levels led to lower water productivity in each fruit load group consistent with water productivity reduction in almond egea et al 2010 pomegranate parvizi et al 2014 and olive ahumada orellana et al 2017 trees with the increase of water application nevertheless high water productivity or low wupf is not the primary consideration related to net profits in date palm cultivation especially under saline irrigation conditions net profits did not continuously ascend with increasing fruit load intensity in each irrigation treatment as they were governed by both fruit quality and yield elevated irrigation levels enhanced net profits compared to regular irrigation in each fruit load group suggesting that increased wupf was highly compensated by improved fruit quality cultivation profitability increase was also reported in grapefruit maestre valero et al 2016 and spring maize zou et al 2020 with increasing irrigation level in addition both w2fl2 and w2fl3 treatments showed higher mean yearly net profits than w1fl2 treatment these results suggested promising feasibility of increasing irrigation application to trees with commercial or even higher fruit load for higher net profits under saline water supply conditions based on our study it is feasible to optimize net profits in date palm cultivation by increasing both fruit load intensity and irrigation level under non limited fruit growing space condition 5 conclusions for the first time we demonstrate the importance of coupled analysis of yield and fruit quality with economic aspects in date palms this integrative analysis improves our perspective on irrigation and agronomic management fruit load intensity and irrigation level affected fruit quality water productivity and net profits of date palm trees high fruit load increased yield and water productivity but reduced fruit quality under each irrigation treatment elevated irrigation application improved fruit quality but decreased water productivity due to non significant yield increase in each fruit load group compared to regular irrigation application as a result of enhanced salt leaching in the root zone nevertheless water productivity reduction was highly compensated by improved fruit quality in trees under higher water application additionally trees with commercial or higher fruit load under high irrigation level exhibited higher net profits than current practice it is concluded that adequate irrigation amounts contribute to net profits in date palm trees treated with high fruit load intensity under saline irrigation conditions specifically 144 etp is recommended for date palm irrigation under aforementioned commercial fruit load intensity and salinity level conditions commercial yield of date palm under optimal fertigation regime is governed by both climate condition and cultivation management pronounced differences in measured yield were found along the two year study therefore the research outcomes should further consider the inter annual yield variability additionally the current study implied the potential of yield and net profit increase by providing non limited fruitlet growing

10498,an integrated research coupling a field study with an agronomic economic model answer app was conducted to investigate the combined effects of irrigation levels and crop loads on fruit quality water productivity and profitability of mature date palms the study took place in israel s hyper arid arava valley where date palm trees are widely cultivated and rely exclusively on brackish water irrigation three fruit load intensities low fl1 commercial fl2 high fl3 and two irrigation levels w1 and w2 equal to and higher than the local irrigation regime respectively were applied in a 22 year old date palm orchard in 2018 2019 irrigation amount fruit quality and yield were measured profitability for each treatment was analyzed with the answer app higher fruit load resulted in higher yield and water productivity but on the other hand led to reduced fruit physical properties size and mass regardless of the irrigation treatment the improved fruit physical properties and net profits in w2 compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group resulted from excess salt leaching in the root zone notably trees under w2fl2 treatment were found to have highest net profits it is concluded that adequate irrigation amounts contribute to net profits in date palm trees treated with high fruit load intensity under saline irrigation conditions keywords crop load irrigation scheduling agronomic economic model salinity yield 1 introduction date palm trees are widely grown in israel s hyper arid arava valley where the annual average evaporation class a pan and yearly rainfall are 3200 mm and 25 mm respectively tripler et al 2011 cohen and glasner 2015 hence the sustainable cultivation of date palm trees in this region relies exclusively on high frequency irrigation the main water source for palm irrigation in the hyper arid region is from saline groundwater with an electrical conductivity ec greater than 2 5 ds m 1 tripler et al 2011 al muaini et al 2019b saline irrigation leads to the reduction of vegetative growth and fruit production in palm trees due to salinity stress tripler et al 2011 sperling et al 2014 ait el mokhtar et al 2019 serret et al 2020 nevertheless the cultivation of date palms in the arava valley is still profitable due to increasing demand encouraging local farmers to continuously expand their orchards for more fruit production chao and krueger 2007 al khayri et al 2015 the net cultivation profit is calculated by the difference between economic inputs cost for labor machinery fertigation and management etc and commercial outputs income of selling dates gross revenue is determined by both fruit yield and quality fereres and soriano 2007 rey et al 2016 lopez et al 2018 as harvested dates are divided into different categories for different sale prices based on fruit quality mainly size and mass fruit thinning is a common practice to reduce the fruit load intensity after fruit set in fruiting trees for the purpose of regulating fruit quality dennis 2000 link 2000 previous studies show that higher fruit size and mass were achieved in peach berman and dejong 1996 orange syvertsen et al 2003 apple naor et al 2008 and persimmon choi et al 2010 trees with lower fruit load high quality fruit contributed to net profits but only partially on the other hand low fruit load in fruiting trees resulted in low yield trentacoste et al 2010 cohen and glasner 2015 samuolienė et al 2016 currently the amount of irrigation water applied in date palm orchards is based on a fixed table of the recommended irrigation regime in the arava valley without respect to fruit load this irrigation regime was previously determined through the product of the reference evapotranspiration times an empirical crop factor varying from 0 5 to 1 sperling 2013 therefore annual irrigation amount is maintained moderately steady leading to relatively stable economic inputs for date palm cultivation consequently low yield resulting from low fruit load reduces water productivity m l 3 which is herein defined as the fruit production per annual irrigation amount applied to date palms al muaini et al 2019c in order to substantially increase net cultivation profits fruit quality and yield of date palm trees have to be well balanced by proper fruit thinning under the current irrigation regime other than fruit load irrigation amount also plays a critical role in the yield of fruiting trees ruiz sanchez et al 2010 crop yield was found to be well correlated with crop transpiration during the growing season de wit 1958d hanks 1974 generally increased irrigation amount leads to higher crop yield to some extent by improving crop evapotranspiration steduto et al 2012 increased yield was reported in olive moriana et al 2003 apple naor et al 2008 almond egea et al 2010 and plum intrigliolo et al 2013 trees under well irrigated conditions compared to deficit irrigation in addition the presence of salts in irrigation water constrains root water uptake by decreasing soil water osmotic pressure further restricting crop yield production bernstein 1975 solomon 1985 negrão et al 2017 in order to mitigate adverse effects of salinity on crop growth soil salinity leaching is usually required by applying excess irrigation water to the root zone shalhevet 1994 levy and syvertsen 2004 letey et al 2011 al muaini et al 2019a this could alleviate soil water osmotic stress by promoting the removal of accumulated salts in the root zone and facilitate crop root water uptake for growth and production ayers and westcot 1985 paranychianakis and chartzoulakis 2005 in date palms tripler et al 2011 reported the reduction of both leaf development and yield in trees subjected to long term application of irrigation water with high salinity these reductions were primarily attributed to photosynthetic assimilation rate decrease due to reduced stomatal conductance associated with restricted root water uptake under osmotic stress condition sperling et al 2014 meanwhile date palms were found to mostly exclude toxic ions mainly na from the sensitive photosynthetic tissues of the leaflet suggesting no permanent damage or efficiency loss in the photosynthetic system sperling 2013 this finding implied the potential of increased date palm photosynthetic assimilation for growth by applying supplemental irrigation water in order to control root zone salinity level especially during the fruit growing season additionally there were no significant differences in fruit size and mass of palm trees irrigated with the salinity levels of 1 8 and 4 0 ds m 1 as fruit load was adjusted based on the canopy size tripler et al 2011 these similar fruit physical properties probably suggested the interplay between fruit load and root zone salinity consequently the fruit size and mass may be improved in date palms with high fruit load under low root zone salinity condition resulting from salt leaching by supplemental irrigation the cost of extra water for leaching requirement may be highly compensated by increased fruit quality and yield thus well balanced fruit quality and yield may be achieved by proper fruit thinning and supplemental irrigation for maximum net profits this study addresses two hypotheses 1 fruit quality and yield will be improved in date palms with increased irrigation application due to salt leaching in the root zone and 2 optimal net profits will be achieved in date palm trees with well balanced fruit load intensity and irrigation level during the fruit growing season therefore the objective of this study was to investigate effects of combined fruit load intensity and irrigation level on date palm fruit quality water productivity and net profits 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and trees the experiment was carried out in a 22 year old date palm orchard located in israel s central arava valley 30 48 35 5 n 35 16 16 5 e 130 m below sea level detailed climate information of the central arava valley was previously described by zhen et al 2019 the selected experimental plot in the orchard has 242 date palm trees phoenix dactylifera l cv medjool planted in 2002 with a growing space of 9 m by 9 m the plot was divided into 24 groups of nine trees fig s1 the center tree in each group was chosen for the experiment with the rest as the margin twenty four experimental trees were 9 m high with a trunk diameter of 0 6 m they were irrigated two emitters per tree with discharge rate of 37 l h 1 naandanjain israel according to the local irrigation practice fertilizer solution containing 21 ammonium nitrate was proportionally injected to the irrigation water to maintain 60 ppm of n 2 2 treatment application three fruit load intensities and two irrigation levels were jointly applied for two consecutive years 2018 2019 with four repetitions in each treatment fig s1 each group was randomly selected for different extents of fruit thinning trees within the same group received same treatments of fruit load intensity and irrigation level each date palm tree had 27 fruit bunches and each fruit bunch had 35 40 spikelets fruit load intensities were set by controlling the fruitlet number in the spikelet of the fruit bunch low fl1 commercial fl2 and high fl3 fruit load intensities corresponded to 7 10 and 15 fruitlets in the spikelet respectively fruit thinning was conducted from 1st to 7th may 2018 and also during the period of 29th april to 8th may 2019 different irrigation level w1 and w2 equal to and higher than the local irrigation practice respectively was applied in each block fig s2 the yearly irrigation ratio of w2 over w1 was set to 1 10 and 1 25 in 2018 and in 2019 respectively hence there were in total six treatments w1fl1 w1fl2 w1fl3 w2fl1 w2fl2 and w2fl3 2 3 field and laboratory measurement in early may twenty four experimental trees were trimmed to have same number of leaves 108 in 2018 and 145 in 2019 before the onset of fruit load treatments these trees were further pruned in order to have same number of 80 leaves in mid june 2019 irrigation amount was continuously measured by water meters sf15 arad israel in both irrigation levels with three repetitions one repetition per fruit load treatment in each irrigation level in 2018 2019 all water meters were connected to data loggers cr10 campbell scientific logan ut usa collecting data every 15 min the electrical conductivity of irrigation water which contains fertilizer was measured once a month and was 2 4 0 4 ds m 1 throughout the experiment solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were monitored by a nearby meteorological station in yair experimental station 30 46 45 3 n 35 14 31 1 e for the reference evapotranspiration et0 calculation based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 zhen et al 2019 subsequently the potential evapotranspiration etp of date palm was determined by multiplying et0 by an empirical crop factor of 0 89 sperling 2013 average daily etp in 2018 2019 was further calculated for the water demand input in an analytical model the hourly temperature sum tsum for each year for a given time t is calculated as 1 t s u m i 1 t t i where i 1 denotes 01 00 on doy 1 and ti c is hourly air temperature fruitlets were sampled from each experimental tree every 2 3 weeks during the period between may and august fruitlet length width and mass were determined with approaches previously specified by zhen et al 2019 harvest was carried out three times according to fruit ripening stages from early august to early september in 2018 and from late august to mid october in 2019 total yield of each experimental tree was recorded for water productivity calculation harvested fruitlets dates were sampled for mass assessment and further for total number calculation for both seasons 2 4 profitability analysis the answer is an analytical model that computes yield and water use under various combined levels of irrigation and salinity shani et al 2007 2009 specifically evapotranspiration calculation considers soil hydraulic properties climate applied irrigation quantity and quality and crop response to salinity the average daily etp for the whole year governs crop water demand the model assumes a steady state condition of water and salinity in both irrigation and soil the average daily evapotranspiration et mm day 1 is calculated by the following equation 2 e t min e t p ψ r o o t ψ w a t e r i e t k s 1 η i e t b 1 e c i i θ r θ s θ r i e t k s 1 δ e c 50 i e t θ s p where etp mm day 1 is the average daily potential evapotranspiration i mm day 1 is the average daily irrigation amount ψroot mm is the minimum water head at the root soil interface for an optimal water uptake b mm is the effective distance for flow between roots and soil p is the plant characteristic parameter for salinity response function ec50 ds m 1 is the soil saturated paste solution ec causing

is the residual soil water content and θs is the saturated soil water content the yield is then calculated assuming a proportional relationship between relative yield yr and relative evapotranspiration etr expressed according to hanks 1974 as follows 3 y r y y p e t e t p e t r where y and yp m l 2 are actual and potential yield production respectively later on the answer app available at app agri gov il answerapp was developed by integrating answer with agronomic economic indices kaner et al 2017 2019 specifically crop response to irrigation level and salinity is coupled with the water quote pattern and the crop s financial balance the answer app was chosen for this study because it directly solves for net profits under user defined agronomic economic environmental considerations notably the net profit calculation follows common economic principles in the answer app we used the option for various water quotes under different salinities and seasonal water quotation as specifically applied in israel kaner et al 2017 calculation is conducted for one season in a 1 ha date palm orchard the yield is the product of the maximum yield times the relative yield computed in answer the direct income is a multiplication of the specific selling price with the yield economic inputs are calculated as the sum of irrigation cost fixed cost such as machinery labor fertilizer pesticide and management etc and total yield dependent cost related to fruit thinning efficiency commercial outputs are calculated as the sum of annual return on investment and total revenue average price for marketed produce based on fruit class expected net profits are then calculated by the difference between economic inputs and commercial outputs in the application in answer app we utilized crop and soil parameters of shani et al 2007 specified in table 1 then relative yield was calculated for date palm trees with varying daily irrigation rates ranging from 0 5 11 mm day 1 under salinity of 2 4 ds m 1 the maximum yield of date palms was previously reported to be 220 kg per tree pevzner 2015 which was used for yield calculation consequently expected net profits based on both fruit quality and calculated yield were simulated by incorporating economic parameters which are specified in table 2 net profits were determined by scaling the expected net profits with the ratio of measured yield over calculated yield mean yearly net profits in 2018 2019 were then obtained 2 5 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed using irrigation level and fruit load intensity as two factors in spss ibm software development armonk ny usa statistical differences among treatments were later analyzed by student s t test and standard deviations presented by error bars were calculated in microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa usa p 0 05 was used to statistically indicate significant differences 3 results 3 1 climate and irrigation in this study hourly temperature sum difference between two seasons tsum 2018 tsum 2019 started to continuously increase since day of year doy 42 and peaked to the value of 4684 c on doy 115 fig s3 during this period the mean hourly temperature was found to be 2 6 c lower in 2019 than that in 2018 cumulative etp and irrigation amounts are shown in fig 1 two year cumulative etp was 3395 mm equivalent to 4 65 mm day 1 on average yearly irrigation amounts in w1 treatment were 2234 mm equivalent to 6 1 mm day 1 and 1976 mm equivalent to 5 4 mm day 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively meanwhile w2 treatment received stable yearly irrigation amount of 2442 mm equivalent to 6 7 mm day 1 thus the relative irrigation the ratio of mean irrigation rate over the potential evapotranspiration irri etp for w1 was 1 31 in 2018 and 1 16 in 2019 and 1 44 for w2 each year 3 2 fruit and yield fruit load intensity affected fruitlet mass yield fruitlet number water productivity and water use per fruitlet wupf in both years table 3 as for the irrigation level it affected only fruitlet mass in 2018 and all the aforementioned variables except for yield in 2019 however no interactive effect of irrigation level and fruit load intensity was found single fruitlet mass of harvested dates was found to be higher in 2019 than in 2018 in each treatment fig 2 a increasing fruit load resulted in decreasing date mass trees treated with fl3 exhibited lowest date mass than those in other fruit load groups while no significant differences of date mass were found between trees treated with fl1 and with fl2 under each irrigation treatment each year as for the irrigation treatment w2 treatment increased date mass compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group each year in addition trees under w2fl3 treatment showed similar date mass compared to those under w1fl2 treatment for two consecutive years maximum and minimum harvested date mass were found in trees under w2fl1 treatment in 2019 and under w1fl3 treatment in 2018 with the mean values of 26 5 g and 15 2 g respectively the aforementioned differences in date mass among treatments were consistent with differences in fruitlet size and mass measured in august each year table s1 and s2 date palm trees exhibited yield increment in 2019 compared to those in 2018 in each treatment fig 2b additionally fruit load intensity played a crucial role in yield increment trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 were found to have higher yield than those treated with fl1 under each irrigation treatment in 2018 and in 2019 nevertheless there were no significant yield differences between trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 under each irrigation treatment in each season except for trees under w1 treatment in 2018 as for the irrigation treatment w2 treatment did not pronouncedly increase yield compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group each year except for trees treated with fl2 in 2018 trees under w1fl3 and w2fl3 treatments had higher yield than those under w1fl2 treatment in 2018 notably trees under w2fl1 treatment showed non significant yield differences compared to those under w1fl2 treatment in 2018 for the two year experiment maximum yield was found in one tree under w2fl3 treatment to be 225 6 kg in 2019 in addition the lowest yield was found in trees under w1fl1 treatment in 2018 with the mean value of 81 6 kg the number of harvested fruitlets in each treatment remained relatively stable during the two year experiment fig 2c higher crop load increased fruitlet number in date palm trees under each irrigation treatment in each season on the other hand increasing irrigation amount resulted in decreasing fruitlet number in each fruit load group each year however noticeable fruitlet number differences between two irrigation treatments were only found in trees treated with fl3 throughout the experiment yearly and two year in 2018 2019 water productivity were improved with the increasing fruit load in each irrigation treatment fig 3 a trees treated with fl2 or fl3 exhibited higher water productivity than those treated with fl1 in each irrigation treatment within each period meanwhile there were no significant differences of water productivity between trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 in w1 treatment in 2019 and in w2 treatment within each period as for the irrigation treatment w2 treatment reduced water productivity only in trees treated with fl2 and with fl3 in 2019 and also with fl3 in 2018 2019 compared to w1 treatment in 2018 2019 lowest and highest water productivity were 0 464 kg m 3 and 0 943 kg m 3 in trees under w2fl1 and w1fl3 treatments respectively water use per fruitlet was derived based on calculated yearly water productivity and measured fruitlet mass fig 3b it decreased with increasing fruit load in each irrigation treatment except for between trees under w2fl2 and w2fl3 treatments in 2018 conversely wupf increased with elevated irrigation in each fruit load group each year with no remarkable differences in trees treated with fl1 each year and with fl2 in 2018 respectively in addition trees under w2fl3 treatment did not exhibit pronounced wupf differences compared to w1fl2 each year maximum and minimum wupf values were 54 1 l and 17 3 l in trees under w2fl1 and w1fl3 treatments respectively meanwhile trees under w2fl2 treatment showed a similar wupf for two consecutive years with the value of 30 9 l 3 3 net profits simulation outputs from answer app showed that the relative yield of date palm increased from 0 749 to 0 890 by increasing relative irrigation from 1 0 1 44 under irrigation ec of 2 4 ds m 1 fig 4 a the regular irrigation treatment w1 had a relative yield of 0 862 in 2018 and 0 816 in 2019 while w2 treatment had a similar relative yield of 0 89 for two consecutive years in addition mean yearly net profits in 2018 2019 considering both fruit quality and yield are presented in fig 4b trees treated with fl2 and with fl1 exhibited highest and lowest net profits respectively in each irrigation treatment as for the irrigation level w2 treatment increased net profits compared to w1 treatment in each fruit load group maximum mean yearly net profits were found in trees under w2fl2 treatment with the value of 73 731 usd ha 1 notably trees under w2fl3 treatment showed higher net profits with the value of 65 837 usd ha 1 than those under w1fl2 treatment with the value of 64 322 usd ha 1 as w1fl2 treatment is that currently applied for commercial date palm production 4 discussion in this study we investigated both agronomic and economic consequences of crop load and irrigation levels with saline water quality fruit load intensity and irrigation level affected fruit quality and water productivity of date palm trees in the arava valley with saline water resources according to field measurements subsequently the interaction between fruit quality and yield played a crucial role in net cultivation profits based on answer app simulations better understanding of these effects will be helpful in applying well balanced fruit load intensity and irrigation level for optimal net profits under saline irrigation conditions both single fruitlet mass and yield of date palm trees were improved in 2019 compared to those in 2018 under each treatment probably due to low hourly temperature sum during flowering and early fruiting period in 2019 delayed onset of bud initiation in apple trees was reported to be driven by insufficient heat accumulation rather than by day length and the rate of bud initiation was not affected by crop load kofler et al 2019 in addition yield reduction in maize under warmer conditions compared to a normal temperature regime was found due to increased rate of phenological development hatfield and prueger 2015 in this study the final harvest in 2019 was completed around 1 5 months later than that in 2018 therefore moderated phenological development rate and prolonged fruit growing season of date palm trees led to higher single fruitlet mass and yield in 2019 compared to those in 2018 in each treatment differences in fruitlet size were similar to those found in fruitlet mass among treatments and fruitlet size was reported to be relatively stable from the onset of sugar accumulation until the harvest zhen et al 2019 therefore the fruit quality is solely governed by fruitlet mass single fruitlet mass was reduced by increasing fruit load in each irrigation treatment consistent with findings in peach berman and dejong 1996 orange syvertsen et al 2003 apple naor et al 2008 and persimmon choi et al 2010 trees reduced fruitlet mass resulted from constrained carbohydrate availability to each fruitlet in the tree under high fruit load condition link 2000 génard et al 2008 serra et al 2016 on the other hand increasing fruit load resulted in higher yield in each irrigation treatment most likely due to enhanced gas exchanges zhen et al 2019 previously showed that both stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation rates were significantly higher in fruiting date palm trees compared to those without fruit from the onset of fruit development until post harvest period higher gas exchanges were also reported in avocado schaffer et al 1987 plum gucci et al 1991 and apple wünsche et al 2005 due to the presence of high fruit load thus enhanced gas exchanges for transpiration and assimilation contributed to yield increment in accordance with previous studies in olive trentacoste et al 2010 naor et al 2013 bustan et al 2016 date palm cohen and glasner 2015 and apples samuolienė et al 2016 elevated irrigation levels increased fruitlet mass compared to regular irrigation in each fruit load group we suggest that the higher irrigation level especially during the fruit growing season improved root water uptake by increased salt leaching from the root zone and hence allowed for optimal gas exchanges it was found by tripler et al 2011 that both vegetative and reproductive growth were higher in palms irrigated with lower ec water in addition sperling et al 2014 reported higher stomatal conductance assimilation rates and growth in date palm trees under low salinity condition compared to those at high salinities thus the increased fruitlet mass is mainly attributed to lower root zone salinity leading to more carbohydrates available to fruit growth under w2 regime notably a similar fruitlet mass was found between w1fl2 and w2fl3 treatments although fruit load and irrigation level did not show interactive effects on it this finding suggested a trade off effect of high fruit load and low soil salinity on fruit quality consistent with similar mean fruit mass between low and high irrigation fruit load treatments in apple trees naor et al 2008 the current study proved the feasibility of achieving commercial fruit quality by reducing root zone salinity stress under high fruit load conditions as for the increased irrigation level it did not lead to significant yield increase in trees in comparison with those under w1 treatment in each fruit load group according to fruitlet number after the harvest fig 2c lower value was found in trees under w2 treatment indicating excessive fruitlet drop during the fruit growing season compared to those under w1 treatment excessive fruitlet drop most likely resulted from limited growing space along the spikelet as fruitlet mass closely related to size was higher in trees under w2 treatment than in those under w1 treatment in each fruit load group this speculation was well upheld by a remarkably lower fruitlet number in trees treated with fl3 under w2 treatment compared to those under w1 treatment as w2fl3 trees showed significantly higher fruitlet mass and size than w1fl3 trees in both years in addition spreer et al 2009 documented higher fruit drop rate in pomegranate trees under well irrigated conditions compared to deficit irrigation as for date palm trees regular irrigation was reported to cause higher bunch drop than deficit irrigation implying indirect effects of high irrigation level on fruit growth cohen et al 2010 consequently elevated irrigation levels in the present study can partially explain fruitlet drop in date palms therefore the potential of yield increase would probably be achieved by providing non limited fruitlet growing space during the fruit thinning process water productivity was apparently improved by increasing fruit load accompanied with higher yield of date palm trees in each irrigation treatment conversely elevated irrigation levels led to lower water productivity in each fruit load group consistent with water productivity reduction in almond egea et al 2010 pomegranate parvizi et al 2014 and olive ahumada orellana et al 2017 trees with the increase of water application nevertheless high water productivity or low wupf is not the primary consideration related to net profits in date palm cultivation especially under saline irrigation conditions net profits did not continuously ascend with increasing fruit load intensity in each irrigation treatment as they were governed by both fruit quality and yield elevated irrigation levels enhanced net profits compared to regular irrigation in each fruit load group suggesting that increased wupf was highly compensated by improved fruit quality cultivation profitability increase was also reported in grapefruit maestre valero et al 2016 and spring maize zou et al 2020 with increasing irrigation level in addition both w2fl2 and w2fl3 treatments showed higher mean yearly net profits than w1fl2 treatment these results suggested promising feasibility of increasing irrigation application to trees with commercial or even higher fruit load for higher net profits under saline water supply conditions based on our study it is feasible to optimize net profits in date palm cultivation by increasing both fruit load intensity and irrigation level under non limited fruit growing space condition 5 conclusions for the first time we demonstrate the importance of coupled analysis of yield and fruit quality with economic aspects in date palms this integrative analysis improves our perspective on irrigation and agronomic management fruit load intensity and irrigation level affected fruit quality water productivity and net profits of date palm trees high fruit load increased yield and water productivity but reduced fruit quality under each irrigation treatment elevated irrigation application improved fruit quality but decreased water productivity due to non significant yield increase in each fruit load group compared to regular irrigation application as a result of enhanced salt leaching in the root zone nevertheless water productivity reduction was highly compensated by improved fruit quality in trees under higher water application additionally trees with commercial or higher fruit load under high irrigation level exhibited higher net profits than current practice it is concluded that adequate irrigation amounts contribute to net profits in date palm trees treated with high fruit load intensity under saline irrigation conditions specifically 144 etp is recommended for date palm irrigation under aforementioned commercial fruit load intensity and salinity level conditions commercial yield of date palm under optimal fertigation regime is governed by both climate condition and cultivation management pronounced differences in measured yield were found along the two year study therefore the research outcomes should further consider the inter annual yield variability additionally the current study implied the potential of yield and net profit increase by providing non limited fruitlet growing

1 1 background and significance the security challenge of water food and energy has become a major concern worldwide it is recorded that in the last fifty years global per capita resource ownership of freshwater arable land and fossil energy has dropped by 20 40 aiko et al 2017 in the following two decades the demands for water food and energy are predicted to rise by 30 50 kaddoura and el khatib 2017 such amplifying gap between resource supply and demand would be further exacerbated by continuous population growth socioeconomic development and climate change water plays a core role in socioeconomic development that tightly connects food and energy daher et al 2020 irrigational agriculture as the backbone of food security accounts for nearly 70 of global water withdrawals mohtar and daher 2016 industry consumes 22 of water resources most of which is used for cooling thermal processes in electricity generation iea 2016 the development of agriculture and energy sectors might be limited by water availability especially in arid and semiarid regions strong competition is expected to emerge in water uses between food and energy d odorico et al 2018 moreover water abstraction pumping drainage and irrigation for crop cannot be implemented without energy the availability of energy also restricts some agricultural practices for food production such as tillage and harvesting

energy policy and portfolio sustainability tradeoff evaluation in texas case results find that conservation policies should move from the silo to the nexus mentality al thani et al 2020 developed a linear optimization model for wfe nexus management which maximizes the nutritional value of agricultural output through the optimal allocation of water and energy resources wfe nexus is a complex system involving multiple components stakeholders and processes the system is not only plagued with internal interactions but also affected by external factors e g environment economy policy and technology insufficient knowledge of connections of components and lack of databases are also obstacles in developing the wfe nexus li et al 2019 all these would bring uncertainties to entire system and hamper the decision making process in detail the subjective judgments may result in fuzzy information of parameters the stochastic fluctuation of precipitation may lead to random water availability sun et al 2019 in face of these problems inexact optimization techniques e g fuzzy and chance constrained programing have been used in single or water energy water food systems for instance lv et al 2018 used fuzzy probability distribution to quantify the uncertainty of water availability in the hebei s energy water nexus system sanchis et al 2019 proposed a mathematical programming model to optimize the selection of the water sources and the volume in water networks with fuzzy costs minimization 1 3 research gap summarily previous wfe nexus studies are mainly conducted based on some deterministic methods however these methods may ignore the uncertain environment in the wfe system uncertain mathematical programming methods can effectively capture the inexact information in wfe nexus system namany et al 2019 conventional inexact optimization models tend to take a maximized system benefit or a minimized system cost as single objective function to achieve optimal resource allocation patterns however in some water stressed regions e g northwest china concerns on water use efficiency are more encouraged than single benefit maximum or cost effective objective therefore multi objectives are expected to be explored fractional programming is proposed for presenting output input ratio optimization problems by comparing two objectives of different aspects arya and singh 2019 however fractional programming itself lacks the ability of uncertainty reflection consequently some uncertain fractional methods e g fuzzy fractional programming and fuzzy chance constrained programming are proposed to purse maximizing resource use efficiency cui et al 2015 ren et al 2016 zhang and guo 2018 even if the above methods are effective for handling the multi objectives and uncertainties in single resources allocation few applications of these methods to solve the interrelations among multiple resources in practices are reported 1 4 objective the objective of this study is to develop an uncertain wfe nexus model to co manage water food and energy through integrating methods of chance constrained programming fuzzy credibility constrained programming and fractional programming into a framework chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method is developed cffp is used to quantify the uncertain and complicated information of wfe nexus system the novelty and contribution of cffp could be concluded as 1 capturing the random and fuzzy parameters in probabilistic and possibilistic manners 2 helping gain in depth analysis the tradeoffs between benefit and risk in an interactive system 3 optimizing the system efficiency represented as output input ratios then cffp based wfe nexus model will be formulated for managing water land representing food and electricity denoting energy in kaikong watershed the efficiency of system benefit vs water use amount will be optimized which can help managers decide the watershed management alternatives for pursuing wfe nexus security 2 material and methods 2 1 study area kaikong watershed is located in the middle reach of the tarim river i e the largest arid inland basin in china and has an area of approximately 31 400 km2 sun et al 2018 this watershed is a typical water shortage region with extremely dry climate the gross annual amount of surface water resources of the basin is approximately 3300 106 m3 80 of which is generated during may to september the upper reach of the watershed is a runoff generation area with little human activities the middle and lower reaches are the main economic development zone of bayangol mongol autonomous prefecture bmap whose population reaches one million in 2018 expanding population and booming economy in the rapidly developing region has brought massive demands for water food and energy as a result the shrinking water availability saline arable land and limited fossil energy exacerbate the gap between resources demand and supply kaikong watershed in an agriculture oriented region where water intensive crops e g wheat and cotton remain the main source of income in many parts of the region the scarce precipitation and excessive evaporation cause that crop cultivation is only feasible through irrigation lee and jung 2018 water for irrigation occupies more than 70 of total water uses in the region 80 of irrigation water is withdrawn from surface water and 20 are from groundwater that is mainly recharged by canal system and farmland inﬁltration wei 2019 the amount of water availability decreases 9 106 m3 per year averagely since 2000s flood and furrow irrigations with low water use efficiency are the most widespread types of irrigation in the watershed such irrigation modes not only have negative impacts on water availability but also influence the groundwater table and lead to soil salinization as a result land degradation has been widely expanded in this region the declining available water and arable land pose great challenges to increasing food demand energy consumption in this region still relies on coal and gas the proportion of coal and gas fired electricity power occupies as high as 65 jin et al 2017 however thermal power plants coal gas fired power need massive water in cooling steam generation and desulfurization the growing electricity demand leads to further increased water demand enhancing the conflict between energy and water resources additionally the massive fossil energy consumption not only causes water wastes but also brings about excessive emissions of pollutants sulphur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matter pm and greenhouse gas e g co2 influencing regional environmental and ecological sustainability besides the policy for controlling co2 and pollutants may also affect electricity generation decisions therefore bringing energy water food pollutant and co2 into a comprehensive framework is necessary 2 2 cffp based wfe nexus model a cffp based wfe nexus model is established as shown in fig 1 in the model four crops wheat cotton vegetable and others and five electricity generation types coal fired power gas fired power hydropower solar power and wind power are considered as main water users due to the intricate interactions among water food and energy the holistic nexus system is plagued with complexities that beyond the conventional linear programming the complexities of the study problem may include a water availability is random due to climate change snow melt and rainfall b the irrigation demand of crops may be vagueness with impact of uncertain soil features rainfall evaporation and irrigation techniques c water demand of electricity generation is uncertain due to the errors in data collections and technique innovations d the policies for controlling co2 and pollutants may be subjective due to the variations of policies and e the wfen system may be involved with multiple objectives e g the system benefit maximization and water use minimization all these complexities would affect the model outcomes and managers decisions in order to deal with the above problems a chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method is proposed for uncertainty reflection risk analysis and bi objective presentation accordingly a cffp based wfe nexus model is formulated for co managing water food and energy the variables for the model are crop area cait generation amount of electricity egjt water allocated to crop wfit and water allocated to electricity generation wejt in detail the objective is to pursue the maximum unit water benefit as follows 1 m a x f b e n c a b e n e g c o s w a c o s c o 2 c o s p p i 1 4 t 1 3 w f i t j 1 5 t 1 3 w e j t where 1 net benefit from agricultural

this study wfe nexus management strategies are strongly driven by the objective of unit water benefit maximization over the planning horizon i e eq 1 such objective is a functional relationship expressed as a ratio between system benefit i e numerator and water use volume i e denominator the system benefit is the differential between benefits from food production and electricity generations and the costs for water resources co2 and pollutant treatments the utilization of resources is restrained by resource availabilities demands and environmental concerns eqs 3 16 are described as a set of inequalities for defining the relationship among decision variables food production electricity generation and water allocation resources availabilities water demands electricity demands pollutant and co2 emission allowances through these constraints the competitions among the three subsystems i e water food and energy can be effectively captured for example eq 3 reflects the competition in water resources between agricultural and electric sectors eq 4 handles the tradeoffs between water resources and agricultural sector in the limitation of electricity availability in general the detailed constraints are listed as follows 1 water availability constraint the sum of water allocated to irrigational agriculture electricity generation and other sectors oswt must not exceed the allowable water availability awrt 3 pr i 1 4 w e i t j 1 5 w f j t o s w t a w r t 1 p t where pr is an chance constrained programming method and is used for reflect the random characteristics of

variables and parameters are provided in the appendix a the solution algorithms of the model could refer to the supplementary material in this study four p levels 0 01 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 six α values 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 and six β levels 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 are considered leading to totally 144 scenarios in practical implementation the solving process of the model would run 144 times on an intel r core tm i7 6700 3 40 ghz cpu with 8 0 gb of memory the difference in the input data of 144 running times is mainly the changes of p α and β levels corresponding to different water availabilities water demands for crop and electricity and limitation for co2 and pollutant emission 2 3 data collection and analysis the planning horizon includes three periods with each of one year from 2020 to 2023 data related to water resources electricity agriculture and economy are obtained from governmental reports statistical yearbooks related literatures and expert surveys the main data types and sources are listed in table 1 in detail the data of water demands and availabilities are shown in table 2 irrigation water demand of each crop is obtained from the local standards for water quota of irrigated agriculture in xinjiang db 65 3611 2014 these data are modified as fuzzy parameters according to the technique conditions and expert suggestions for example irrigation water demand of cotton in period 1 is 5705 5944 6097 m3 ha this is a triangular fuzzy parameter expressed with lower and upper bound values and average value in the model running process this data can be converted into a deterministic one when α is known i e 2 1 α 5944 2α 1 5705 m3 ha water demands for electricity generations which are also expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers due to statistic error and technique innovation are collected from related published papers by lv et al 2018 and rodriguez et al 2018 water availability is estimated by subtracting the volume of water that downstream ecology needs qdown from streamflow of dashankou hydrological station during 1970 2015 the calculation of qdown is based on the tenant method that indicates 30 of total water volumes are promised sun et al 2018 probability fitting is implemented for obtaining the potential distribution of water availability and the discrete data under different probability levels are listed in table 2 groundwater is not considered in this study as nearly 80 surface water is used for irrigation therefore the arable land area in this study are calculated with the actual area obtained from the statistic yearbook 2019 in xinjiang multiplying the proportion the gross benefits and cots of crop planting and electricity generation as listed in table 3 are obtained from the food and agriculture organization of the unit nations fao www fao org and some publications e g singh 2015 and sun et al 2019 the allowable emission of co2 pollutant data are collected from the bulletin of ecological environment protection of bmap in 2019 and is adjusted into triangular fuzzy numbers for example in period 1 the co2 emission amount is 698 891 1165 103 ton according to the solution agglomeration this data can be converted into 2β 1 1165 2 1 β 891 103 when β level is determined 3 result analysis 3 1 unit water benefit fig 2 displays the unit water benefits under the given 144 scenarios results show that the highest unit water benefit is 0 926 m3 p 0 15 α 0 5 and β 0 5 and the lowest is 0 852 m3 p 0 01 α 1 and β 1 higher level of p and lower levels of α and β would result in higher unit water benefit in fact levels of p α and β correspond to the constraint violation risk higher p level representing higher water availability and lower α lower water demand and β levels lower pollutant co2 emission would lead to looser constraints as a result positive attitudes to resources allocation are decided by managers such positive attitudes often relate to high violation risks once water availability decreases water demands increase and pollutant co2 emissions loose such positive decisions may cause system reliability decrease therefore tradeoffs between system unit water benefit and system risk are important 3 2 crop area crop land allocation is an important alternative for pursuing unit water benefit maximization the solutions of the wfe model reveal that change of co2 pollutant emissions has negligible effect on crop area therefore the areas of crops under different water availabilities and demands are summarized in fig 3 results show that crop area would decline from period 1 to period 3 such declination is mainly attributed to the accumulated salinity of soil and groundwater as well as the governmental policy for ecological protection at the end of planning horizon the total crop area of kaikong watershed should be controlled below 203 5 103 ha the real area has close relation to water availability i e increase of p level and demand i e increase of α level for example in period 3 when p 0 05 irrigation water demands of wheat and cotton would decrease from 5795 α 1 to 5190 m3 ha α 0 5 and 6079 α 1 to 5705 m3 ha α 0 5 correspondingly crop area increases from 190 0 to 194 1 103 ha such results illustrate that water demand side management e g irrigation mode improvement can help save water resources for irrigational agriculture the detailed area of each crop in fig 3b shows that cotton keeps the main crop in kaikong watershed in period 1 the proportion of cotton s area ranges from 57 8 to 61 9 across all levels of p and α the high proportion of cotton s area is mainly determined by its high economic value and governmental policy however from the perspective of time scale its proportion declines across all scenarios decreases to 53 9 to 59 1 in period 3 such declination is contributed to its high demand for water correspondingly the area of vegetables mainly tomato pepper and beet would increases from period 1 3 in period 1 the area is 17 8 30 3 103 ha across the 144 scenarios in period 3 the area increases to 18 2 35 6 103 ha changes of water availabilities and demands pose great impact on the area due to high benefit and moderate water demand corresponding to high unit water benefit land area is firstly allocated to vegetable once irrigational agriculture is expanded therefore vegetable is encouraged in kaikong watershed however when water availability increases to 3126 106 m3 vegetable area would keep unchanged about 35 6 103 ha in period 3 due to its arable area limitation by policy as well as local climate soil and irrigation conditions therefore expanding investment on infrastructure of vegetable planting could be assessed and considered in future agricultural development 3 3 electricity generation fig 4 depicts the total electricity generation amount which is about 8800 9700 gwh in period 1 9100 10 200 gwh in period 2 and 9500 11 100 gwh in period 3 in fact the actual amount has a large relationship with water availability water demand and pollutant co2 emissions in detail increased water availability and pollutant co2 emission allowance and decreased water demands would stimulate electricity generation when water availability increases from 2949 to 3183 106 m3 in period 3 electricity generation amount rises from 10 834 to 11 075 gwh under the maximum water demand and minimization pollutant co2 emission allowance however the highest electricity generation amount would not always occur in the condition of maximum water availability minimum water demand and the strictest pollutant co2 emission this illustrates that a synergistic effect exists among the three controlling factors it is critical to balance the relationship of them during electricity optimization process for achieving the goals of resources utilization minimization and unit water benefit maximization the optimized fossil energy power i e coal and gas fired electricity amount occupies 62 9 66 1 in period 1 60 7 64 2 in period 2 and 53 1 60 4 in period 3 respectively in practical management the proportion should be decided according to varied polices and water resources for example as shown in fig 5 under the scenario of the lowest water demand and water availability fossil energy power proportion would decrease from 65 2 63 7 with allowable pollutant co2 emissions reduce such reduction is largely attributed to the shrinkage of coal fired electricity because it s main contributor of pollutants fig 5 also shows that the proportion of fossil energy power would decline when the available water resources decrease and water demands increase this is because coal and gas fired electricity generation types would consume larger amount of water resources than renewable energy power moreover unit water benefit of renewable energy power is higher than that of fossil energy power according to these optimized results decisions on electricity generation could be made according to practical water resources conditions for example when water availability is in low level in period 3 the proportion of renewable energy power could be promoted from 43 0 to 43 8 by adopting water saving technologies it is also indicated that the proportion of coal fired power would be more obviously impacted by water resources than that of gas fired power therefore innovative water saving techniques should be implemented for coal fired power first due to its sensitivity to variations of water availability and demand 4 discussion 4 1 competition in water for agriculture and electricity water security is the most prominent problem in kaikong watershed s wfe nexus which is manifested in the competitive relationship between agricultural and electric productions therefore competition in water use for food and energy security is the core of an emerging debate on the wfe nexus in the arid region to meet the minimum food requirement in this watershed the lowest amount of water resources allocated to irrigational agriculture must be above 1853 106 m³ in period 1 1709 106 m³ in period 2 and 1642 106 m³ in period 3 respectively water allocated amounts of different crops are shown in fig 6 results show that in period 1 water allocated to the four crops are 370 106 m³ wheat 1142 106 m³ cotton 183 106 m³ vegetable and 158 106 m³ others under the maximum water demand condition the values would change to 350 106 m³ wheat 1113 106 m³ cotton 246 106 m³ vegetable and 144 106 m³ others under the minimum irrigation water demand condition it is obvious that cotton is the main competitor for water resources whose water use occupies more than 60 of irrigation water fig 7 summarizes the total water use of electricity generation under the defined 144 scenarios the total amounts of water allocated to electricity generation are 71 1 79 3 106 m³ in period 1 73 5 80 5 106 m³ in period 2 and 67 3 81 8 106 m³ in period 3 as shown in table 4 coal fired electricity generation is largest water consumer occupying around 50 of energy sector followed by gas fired electricity generation occupying above 30 fossil energy power is the main contributor to water consumption of energy sector and water demand management of fossil energy power is very important uncertainties in the model i e random water availability and fuzzy water demand and pollutant co2 emission has an impact on competition in water resources increment of water availability brings both increases in water allocation to agricultural and electric productions illustrating that water supply side management strategies can stimulate production expansions at the end of planning horizon if water demand side management is conducted representing changes in α of the wfe model total water allocation to electricity generation would averagely decrease 3 6 106 m³ however water allocation to irrigational agriculture would averagely increase 16 106 m³ such results illustrate that water saving technologies can enhance expansion of irrigational agriculture however the unit water benefits of crops are much smaller than that of electricity generation continuous expansion of irrigational agriculture would have negative impact on system therefore when the water allocation to irrigational agriculture increases to an extent to meet the maximized unit water benefit the residual water resources can be saved to ecological protection results also show that when the water availability is at low level p 0 01 water allocated to agricultural and electric production would not change too much indicating that interactions among water availability water demand and pollutant co2 emission allowance exists in wfe system which would affect the competition in water resources generally the water allocations to agricultural and electric productions has large relations with crop area and electricity generation patterns for alleviate the adverse impact of competition in water resources and realize sustainable development some strategies are advised according to the results these strategies can be concluded as i optimizing the use of agricultural lands it is suggested that at the end of planning horizon the total crop area should be controlled below 203 5 103 ha proportion of cotton is better limited within 59 3 for guaranteeing food security vegetable is encouraged to be expanded in a range from 18 2 35 6 103 ha ii optimizing the pattern of the electricity generation total electricity generation capacity can be expanded to 9500 11 100 gwh at the end of planning horizon and fossil energy power should be controlled within 53 1 60 4 and iii effectively managing water resources from both supply and demand sides promoting water availability and declining water demand can help promote production scale of crop and electricity demand side strategies related to quota management and water conservation should be more widely considered in the practices such as irrigation mode promotion e g drip irrigation and canal system improvement 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis of the model is performed to test the uncertainties in prices and costs of productions and their effectiveness in maximizing the unit water benefit the costs and prices are decreased increased by 5 10 20 and 30 from the existing values and nine scenarios are set in the sensitivity analysis fig 8 shows the changes of unit water benefit cumulative crop area and electricity generation across the three periods under different scenarios it can be seen that the prices of crops and electricity have more obvious effects on unit water benefit crop area and electricity generation than the costs crop price is the most sensitive factor followed by electricity price for example when prices vary from 30 to 30 the unit water benefit would increase by 67 0 under changes of crop price and 37 5 under changes of electricity price such results illustrate that crop is the main controlling factor that influence the objective of water use minimization and system benefit maximization besides low crop price and high electricity price would lead to declined crop area mainly vegetables and increased electricity generation mainly fossil energy power this is because the unit water benefit from electricity is higher than that from crop more water would be delivered to electricity generation sector generally the prices and costs also impact the competition among water agriculture and electricity managers should pay attention to the market rules and make decisions for efficient productions 4 3 accuracy validation a comparison between the model results and the local actual situation is analyzed to validate the accuracy of the obtained results by cffp wfe nexus model according to the statistical yearbook 2019 of xinjiang the total crop area in kaikong watershed is 297 6 103 ha which is larger than the maximized crop area of 203 6 103 ha such differences can be derived from the following reasons i only surface water resources is considered in this study ii the maximized water availability considered in this study is at 15 level of cumulative distribution probability of water availability which is smaller than that of 50 level in 2019 normal year iii only irrigational agriculture is considered in this study which doesn t include non irrigated area reported in statistical yearbook the actual proportion of cotton area is 58 3 in 2019 which falls within the range of 57 8 61 9 in period 1 obtained by the model the optimized electricity generation by cffp wfe nexus model is about 9100 10 200 gwh in period 1 which is smaller than 15 205 gwh in 2019 reported by statistical bulletin of national economic and social development of bmap the statistical bulletin calculated the electricity generation of the whole bmap region however kaikong watershed is a part of the region and the data of three counties luntai qiemo and ruoqiang should be eliminated from the statistical data due to data estimation errors and hypothetical conditions of the model these difference between actual values and model results are acceptable 5 conclusions in this study a chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method has been proposed through integrating chance constrained programming and fuzzy credibility constrained programming within a fractional programing framework each technique offers a unique contribution towards the enhancement of cffp capabilities of wfe nexus system management under multiple uncertainties cffp can not only tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets with membership functions and random parameters with probabilistic distributions but also optimize the system efficiency represented as output input ratios the cffp method has been applied to planning water food and energy nexus system in kaikong watershed where the objective is to attain maximum water use efficiency between system benefit and water use amount issues of random water availability vague water demand and subjective environmental policy are primarily concerned by the modeling formulation solutions have been generated and used for supporting decisions of a achievement of crop plantation patterns b improvement of electricity generation schemes and c generation of water resources allocation alternatives the results suggest that various uncertainties in system components e g water availability water demands of crop and electricity and pollutant co2 emission mitigation option have sound effects on the watershed s wfe nexus system the system unit water benefit ranges from 0 852 to 0 926 m3 increasing with constraint violation risk corresponding to declined system reliability total crop area is expected to be controlled under 203 4 103 ha in adaptation and mitigation to shrinking water resources at the end of planning horizon vegetable planation is encouraged due to its flexibility in responding to changed water availability and demand as well as its highest unit water benefit the share of electricity generated by coal and gas varies would decline with time and shrinking water resources and restricting pollutant co2 emission allowance at the end of planning horizon fossil energy power should be controlled between 53 1 and 60 4 renewable energy power would be supported for mitigation negative impacts of water and environment water resources allocation patterns are highly related with crop areas and electricity generation demand sided management is required in the future practice these findings have provided optimal strategies for limited resources usage these strategies can help achieve sustainability among water food and energy in a manner targeting water stress and environmental emission these results can also be extended to other regions

relationships among water agriculture and electricity chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method is proposed to reflect the uncertainties in wfe nexus system it can handle multi

uncertainties in water availability water demand and pollutant co2 emission have synergistic effects on agricultural and electric productions the unit water benefit ranges from 0 852 to 0 926 m3

provide a synergic management strategy for regional sustainability keywords electricity generation irrigational agriculture multiple uncertainties water scarcity water food energy nexus 1 introduction 1 1 background and significance the security challenge of water food and energy has become a major concern worldwide it is recorded that in the last fifty years global per capita resource ownership of freshwater arable land and fossil energy has dropped by 20 40 aiko et al 2017 in the following two decades the demands for water food and energy are predicted to rise by 30 50 kaddoura and el khatib 2017 such amplifying gap between resource supply and demand would be further exacerbated by continuous population growth socioeconomic development and climate change water plays a core role in socioeconomic development that tightly connects food and energy daher et al 2020 irrigational agriculture as the backbone of food security accounts for nearly 70 of global water withdrawals mohtar and daher 2016 industry consumes 22 of water resources most of which is used for cooling thermal processes in electricity generation iea 2016 the development of agriculture and energy sectors might be limited by water availability especially in arid and semiarid regions strong competition is expected to emerge in water uses between food and energy d odorico et al 2018 moreover water abstraction pumping drainage and irrigation for crop cannot be implemented without energy the availability of energy also restricts some agricultural practices for food production such as tillage and harvesting in the field rosa et al 2018 the mutually interdependence among the three critical resources can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food water and energy security 1 2 literature review previously numerous research works put water food and energy into a comprehensive water food energy wfe nexus framework daher and mohtar 2015 methods of scenario analysis system dynamic model agent based model input output model and deterministic optimization were applied to identify synergic strategies among resources allocations wicaksono et al 2017 dargin et al 2019 for example el gafy et al 2017 advanced a system dynamic model to simulate the behavior of wfe interactions in the process of crop production and consumption results indicated that irrigation efficiency improvement is the best sustainable measure owen et al 2018 put forward a multiregional input output technique to investigate the impact of wfe interactions in a supply chain twenty nexus pathways and associated reverse impact reduction strategies were identified daher et al 2019 advanced social network analysis and bivariate regression analysis method which was used to investigate the levels of coordination among the various officials responsible for water energy food nexus system planning in san antonio mroue et al 2018 presented a scenario based holistic water energy food nexus tool for energy policy and portfolio sustainability tradeoff evaluation in texas case results find that conservation policies should move from the silo to the nexus mentality al thani et al 2020 developed a linear optimization model for wfe nexus management which maximizes the nutritional value of agricultural output through the optimal allocation of water and energy resources wfe nexus is a complex system involving multiple components stakeholders and processes the system is not only plagued with internal interactions but also affected by external factors e g environment economy policy and technology insufficient knowledge of connections of components and lack of databases are also obstacles in developing the wfe nexus li et al 2019 all these would bring uncertainties to entire system and hamper the decision making process in detail the subjective judgments may result in fuzzy information of parameters the stochastic fluctuation of precipitation may lead to random water availability sun et al 2019 in face of these problems inexact optimization techniques e g fuzzy and chance constrained programing have been used in single or water energy water food systems for instance lv et al 2018 used fuzzy probability distribution to quantify the uncertainty of water availability in the hebei s energy water nexus system sanchis et al 2019 proposed a mathematical programming model to optimize the selection of the water sources and the volume in water networks with fuzzy costs minimization 1 3 research gap summarily previous wfe nexus studies are mainly conducted based on some deterministic methods however these methods may ignore the uncertain environment in the wfe system uncertain mathematical programming methods can effectively capture the inexact information in wfe nexus system namany et al 2019 conventional inexact optimization models tend to take a maximized system benefit or a minimized system cost as single objective function to achieve optimal resource allocation patterns however in some water stressed regions e g northwest china concerns on water use efficiency are more encouraged than single benefit maximum or cost effective objective therefore multi objectives are expected to be explored fractional programming is proposed for presenting output input ratio optimization problems by comparing two objectives of different aspects arya and singh 2019 however fractional programming itself lacks the ability of uncertainty reflection consequently some uncertain fractional methods e g fuzzy fractional programming and fuzzy chance constrained programming are proposed to purse maximizing resource use efficiency cui et al 2015 ren et al 2016 zhang and guo 2018 even if the above methods are effective for handling the multi objectives and uncertainties in single resources allocation few applications of these methods to solve the interrelations among multiple resources in practices are reported 1 4 objective the objective of this study is to develop an uncertain wfe nexus model to co manage water food and energy through integrating methods of chance constrained programming fuzzy credibility constrained programming and fractional programming into a framework chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method is developed cffp is used to quantify the uncertain and complicated information of wfe nexus system the novelty and contribution of cffp could be concluded as 1 capturing the random and fuzzy parameters in probabilistic and possibilistic manners 2 helping gain in depth analysis the tradeoffs between benefit and risk in an interactive system 3 optimizing the system efficiency represented as output input ratios then cffp based wfe nexus model will be formulated for managing water land representing food and electricity denoting energy in kaikong watershed the efficiency of system benefit vs water use amount will be optimized which can help managers decide the watershed management alternatives for pursuing wfe nexus security 2 material and methods 2 1 study area kaikong watershed is located in the middle reach of the tarim river i e the largest arid inland basin in china and has an area of approximately 31 400 km2 sun et al 2018 this watershed is a typical water shortage region with extremely dry climate the gross annual amount of surface water resources of the basin is approximately 3300 106 m3 80 of which is generated during may to september the upper reach of the watershed is a runoff generation area with little human activities the middle and lower reaches are the main economic development zone of bayangol mongol autonomous prefecture bmap whose population reaches one million in 2018 expanding population and booming economy in the rapidly developing region has brought massive demands for water food and energy as a result the shrinking water availability saline arable land and limited fossil energy exacerbate the gap between resources demand and supply kaikong watershed in an agriculture oriented region where water intensive crops e g wheat and cotton remain the main source of income in many parts of the region the scarce precipitation and excessive evaporation cause that crop cultivation is only feasible through irrigation lee and jung 2018 water for irrigation occupies more than 70 of total water uses in the region 80 of irrigation water is withdrawn from surface water and 20 are from groundwater that is mainly recharged by canal system and farmland inﬁltration wei 2019 the amount of water availability decreases 9 106 m3 per year averagely since 2000s flood and furrow irrigations with low water use efficiency are the most widespread types of irrigation in the watershed such irrigation modes not only have negative impacts on water availability but also influence the groundwater table and lead to soil salinization as a result land degradation has been widely expanded in this region the declining available water and arable land pose great challenges to increasing food demand energy consumption in this region still relies on coal and gas the proportion of coal and gas fired electricity power occupies as high as 65 jin et al 2017 however thermal power plants coal gas fired power need massive water in cooling steam generation and desulfurization the growing electricity demand leads to further increased water demand enhancing the conflict between energy and water resources additionally the massive fossil energy consumption not only causes water wastes but also brings about excessive emissions of pollutants sulphur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matter pm and greenhouse gas e g co2 influencing regional environmental and ecological sustainability besides the policy for controlling co2 and pollutants may also affect electricity generation decisions therefore bringing energy water food pollutant and co2 into a comprehensive framework is necessary 2 2 cffp based wfe nexus model a cffp based wfe nexus model is established as shown in fig 1 in the model four crops wheat cotton vegetable and others and five electricity generation types coal fired power gas fired power hydropower solar power and wind power are considered as main water users due to the intricate interactions among water food and energy the holistic nexus system is plagued with complexities that beyond the conventional linear programming the complexities of the study problem may include a water availability is random due to climate change snow melt and rainfall b the irrigation demand of crops may be vagueness with impact of uncertain soil features rainfall evaporation and irrigation techniques c water demand of electricity generation is uncertain due to the errors in data collections and technique innovations d the policies for controlling co2 and pollutants may be subjective due to the variations of policies and e the wfen system may be involved with multiple objectives e g the system benefit maximization and water use minimization all these complexities would affect the model outcomes and managers decisions in order to deal with the above problems a chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method is proposed for uncertainty reflection risk analysis and bi objective presentation accordingly a cffp based wfe nexus model is formulated for co managing water food and energy the variables for the model are crop area cait generation amount of electricity egjt water allocated to crop wfit and water allocated to electricity generation wejt in detail the objective is to pursue the maximum unit water benefit as follows 1 m a x f b e n c a b e n e g c o s w a c o s c o 2 c o s p p i 1 4 t 1 3 w f i t j 1 5 t 1 3 w e j t where 1 net benefit from agricultural

this study wfe nexus management strategies are strongly driven by the objective of unit water benefit maximization over the planning horizon i e eq 1 such objective is a functional relationship expressed as a ratio between system benefit i e numerator and water use volume i e denominator the system benefit is the differential between benefits from food production and electricity generations and the costs for water resources co2 and pollutant treatments the utilization of resources is restrained by resource availabilities demands and environmental concerns eqs 3 16 are described as a set of inequalities for defining the relationship among decision variables food production electricity generation and water allocation resources availabilities water demands electricity demands pollutant and co2 emission allowances through these constraints the competitions among the three subsystems i e water food and energy can be effectively captured for example eq 3 reflects the competition in water resources between agricultural and electric sectors eq 4 handles the tradeoffs between water resources and agricultural sector in the limitation of electricity availability in general the detailed constraints are listed as follows 1 water availability constraint the sum of water allocated to irrigational agriculture electricity generation and other sectors oswt must not exceed the

0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 and six β levels 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 are considered leading to totally 144 scenarios in practical implementation the solving process of the model would run 144 times on an intel r core tm i7 6700 3 40 ghz cpu with 8 0 gb of memory the difference in the input data of 144 running times is mainly the changes of p α and β levels corresponding to different water availabilities water demands for crop and electricity and limitation for co2 and pollutant emission 2 3 data collection and analysis the planning horizon includes three periods with each of one year from 2020 to 2023 data related to water resources electricity agriculture and economy are obtained from governmental reports statistical yearbooks related literatures and expert surveys the main data types and sources are listed in table 1 in detail the data of water demands and availabilities are shown in table 2 irrigation water demand of each crop is obtained from the local standards for water quota of irrigated agriculture in xinjiang db 65 3611 2014 these data are modified as fuzzy parameters according to the technique conditions and expert suggestions for example irrigation water demand of cotton in period 1 is 5705 5944 6097 m3 ha this is a triangular fuzzy parameter expressed with lower and upper bound values and average value in the model running process this data can be converted into a deterministic one when α is known i e 2 1 α 5944 2α 1 5705 m3 ha water demands for electricity generations which are also expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers due to statistic error and technique innovation are collected from related published papers by lv et al 2018 and rodriguez et al 2018 water availability is estimated by subtracting the volume of water that downstream ecology needs qdown from streamflow of dashankou hydrological station during 1970 2015 the calculation of qdown is based on the tenant method that indicates 30 of total water volumes are promised sun et al 2018 probability fitting is implemented for obtaining the potential distribution of water availability and the discrete data under different probability levels are listed in table 2 groundwater is not considered in this study as nearly 80 surface water is used for irrigation therefore the arable land area in this study are calculated with the actual area obtained from the statistic yearbook 2019 in xinjiang multiplying the proportion the gross benefits and cots of crop planting and electricity generation as listed in table 3 are obtained from the food and agriculture organization of the unit nations fao www fao org and some publications e g singh 2015 and sun et al 2019 the allowable emission of co2 pollutant data are collected from the bulletin of ecological environment protection of bmap in 2019 and is adjusted into triangular fuzzy numbers for example in period 1 the co2 emission amount is 698 891 1165 103 ton according to the solution agglomeration this data can be converted into 2β 1 1165 2 1 β 891 103 when β level is determined 3 result analysis 3 1 unit water benefit fig 2 displays the unit water benefits under the given 144 scenarios results show that the highest unit water benefit is 0 926 m3 p 0 15 α 0 5 and β 0 5 and the lowest is 0 852 m3 p 0 01 α 1 and β 1 higher level of p and lower levels of α and β would result in higher unit water benefit in fact levels of p α and β correspond to the constraint violation risk higher p level representing higher water availability and lower α lower water demand and β levels lower pollutant co2 emission would lead to looser constraints as a result positive attitudes to resources allocation are decided by managers such positive attitudes often relate to high violation risks once water availability decreases water demands increase and pollutant co2 emissions loose such positive decisions may cause system reliability decrease therefore tradeoffs between system unit water benefit and system risk are important 3 2 crop area crop land allocation is an important alternative for pursuing unit water benefit maximization the solutions of the wfe model reveal that change of co2 pollutant emissions has negligible effect on crop area therefore the areas of crops under different water availabilities and demands are summarized in fig 3 results show that crop area would decline from period 1 to period 3 such declination is mainly attributed to the accumulated salinity of soil and groundwater as well as the governmental policy for ecological protection at the end of planning horizon the total crop area of kaikong watershed should be controlled below 203 5 103 ha the real area has close relation to water availability i e increase of p level and demand i e increase of α level for example in period 3 when p 0 05 irrigation water demands of wheat and cotton would decrease from 5795 α 1 to 5190 m3 ha α 0 5 and 6079 α 1 to 5705 m3 ha α 0 5 correspondingly crop area increases from 190 0 to 194 1 103 ha such results illustrate that water demand side management e g irrigation mode improvement can help save water resources for irrigational agriculture the detailed area of each crop in fig 3b shows that cotton keeps the main crop in kaikong watershed in period 1 the proportion of cotton s area ranges from 57 8 to 61 9 across all levels of p and α the high proportion of cotton s area is mainly determined by its high economic value and governmental policy however from the perspective of time scale its proportion declines across all scenarios decreases to 53 9 to 59 1 in period 3 such declination is contributed to its high demand for water correspondingly the area of vegetables mainly tomato pepper and beet would increases from period 1 3 in period 1 the area is 17 8 30 3 103 ha across the 144 scenarios in period 3 the area increases to 18 2 35 6 103 ha changes of water availabilities and demands pose great impact on the area due to high benefit and moderate water demand corresponding to high unit water benefit land area is firstly allocated to vegetable once irrigational agriculture is expanded therefore vegetable is encouraged in kaikong watershed however when water availability increases to 3126 106 m3 vegetable area would keep unchanged about 35 6 103 ha in period 3 due to its arable area limitation by policy as well as local climate soil and irrigation conditions therefore expanding investment on infrastructure of vegetable planting could be assessed and considered in future agricultural development 3 3 electricity generation fig 4 depicts the total electricity generation amount which is about 8800 9700 gwh in period 1 9100 10 200 gwh in period 2 and 9500 11 100 gwh in period 3 in fact the actual amount has a large relationship with water availability water demand and pollutant co2 emissions in detail increased water availability and pollutant co2 emission allowance and decreased water demands would stimulate electricity generation when water availability increases from 2949 to 3183 106 m3 in period 3 electricity generation amount rises from 10 834 to 11 075 gwh under the maximum water demand and minimization pollutant co2 emission allowance however the highest electricity generation amount would not always occur in the condition of maximum water availability minimum water demand and the strictest pollutant co2 emission this illustrates that a synergistic effect exists among the three controlling factors it is critical to balance the relationship of them during electricity optimization process for achieving the goals of resources utilization minimization and unit water benefit maximization the optimized fossil energy power i e coal and gas fired electricity amount occupies 62 9 66 1 in period 1 60 7 64 2 in period 2 and 53 1 60 4 in period 3 respectively in practical management the proportion should be decided according to varied polices and water resources for example as shown in fig 5 under the scenario of the lowest water demand and water availability fossil energy power proportion would decrease from 65 2 63 7 with allowable pollutant co2 emissions reduce such reduction is largely attributed to the shrinkage of coal fired electricity because it s main contributor of pollutants fig 5 also shows that the proportion of fossil energy power would decline when the available water resources decrease and water demands increase this is because coal and gas fired electricity generation types would consume larger amount of water resources than renewable energy power moreover unit water benefit of renewable energy power is higher than that of fossil energy power according to these optimized results decisions on electricity generation could be made according to practical water resources conditions for example when water availability is in low level in period 3 the proportion of renewable energy power could be promoted from 43 0 to 43 8 by adopting water saving technologies it is also indicated that the proportion of coal fired power would be more obviously impacted by water resources than that of gas fired power therefore innovative water saving techniques should be implemented for coal fired power first due to its sensitivity to variations of water availability and demand 4 discussion 4 1 competition in water for agriculture and electricity water security is the most prominent problem in kaikong watershed s wfe nexus which is manifested in the competitive relationship between agricultural and electric productions therefore competition in water use for food and energy security is the core of an emerging debate on the wfe nexus in the arid region to meet the minimum food requirement in this watershed the lowest amount of water resources allocated to irrigational agriculture must be above 1853 106 m³ in period 1 1709 106 m³ in period 2 and 1642 106 m³ in period 3 respectively water allocated amounts of different crops are shown in fig 6 results show that in period 1 water allocated to the four crops are 370 106 m³ wheat 1142 106 m³ cotton 183 106 m³ vegetable and 158 106 m³ others under the maximum water demand condition the values would change to 350 106 m³ wheat 1113 106 m³ cotton 246 106 m³ vegetable and 144 106 m³ others under the minimum irrigation water demand condition it is obvious that cotton is the main competitor for water resources whose water use occupies more than 60 of irrigation water fig 7 summarizes the total water use of electricity generation under the defined 144 scenarios the total amounts of water allocated to electricity generation are 71 1 79 3 106 m³ in period 1 73 5 80 5 106 m³ in period 2 and 67 3 81 8 106 m³ in period 3 as shown in table 4 coal fired electricity generation is largest water consumer occupying around 50 of energy sector followed by gas fired electricity generation occupying above 30 fossil energy power is the main contributor to water consumption of energy sector and water demand management of fossil energy power is very important uncertainties in the model i e random water availability and fuzzy water demand and pollutant co2 emission has an impact on competition in water resources increment of water availability brings both increases in water allocation to agricultural and electric productions illustrating that water supply side management strategies can stimulate production expansions at the end of planning horizon if water demand side management is conducted representing changes in α of the wfe model total water allocation to electricity generation would averagely decrease 3 6 106 m³ however water allocation to irrigational agriculture would averagely increase 16 106 m³ such results illustrate that water saving technologies can enhance expansion of irrigational agriculture however the unit water benefits of crops are much smaller than that of electricity generation continuous expansion of irrigational agriculture would have negative impact on system therefore when the water allocation to irrigational agriculture increases to an extent to meet the maximized unit water benefit the residual water resources can be saved to ecological protection results also show that when the water availability is at low level p 0 01 water allocated to agricultural and electric production would not change too much indicating that interactions among water availability water demand and pollutant co2 emission allowance exists in wfe system which would affect the competition in water resources generally the water allocations to agricultural and electric productions has large relations with crop area and electricity generation patterns for alleviate the adverse impact of competition in water resources and realize sustainable development some strategies are advised according to the results these strategies can be concluded as i optimizing the use of agricultural lands it is suggested that at the end of planning horizon the total crop area should be controlled below 203 5 103 ha proportion of cotton is better limited within 59 3 for guaranteeing food security vegetable is encouraged to be expanded in a range from 18 2 35 6 103 ha ii optimizing the pattern of the electricity generation total electricity generation capacity can be expanded to 9500 11 100 gwh at the end of planning horizon and fossil energy power should be controlled within 53 1 60 4 and iii effectively managing water resources from both supply and demand sides promoting water availability and declining water demand can help promote production scale of crop and electricity demand side strategies related to quota management and water conservation should be more widely considered in the practices such as irrigation mode promotion e g drip irrigation and canal system improvement 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis of the model is performed to test the uncertainties in prices and costs of productions and their effectiveness in maximizing the unit water benefit the costs and prices are decreased increased by 5 10 20 and 30 from the existing values and nine scenarios are set in the sensitivity analysis fig 8 shows the changes of unit water benefit cumulative crop area and electricity generation across the three periods under different scenarios it can be seen that the prices of crops and electricity have more obvious effects on unit water benefit crop area and electricity generation than the costs crop price is the most sensitive factor followed by electricity price for example when prices vary from 30 to 30 the unit water benefit would increase by 67 0 under changes of crop price and 37 5 under changes of electricity price such results illustrate that crop is the main controlling factor that influence the objective of water use minimization and system benefit maximization besides low crop price and high electricity price would lead to declined crop area mainly vegetables and increased electricity generation mainly fossil energy power this is because the unit water benefit from electricity is higher than that from crop more water would be delivered to electricity generation sector generally the prices and costs also impact the competition among water agriculture and electricity managers should pay attention to the market rules and make decisions for efficient productions 4 3 accuracy validation a comparison between the model results and the local actual situation is analyzed to validate the accuracy of the obtained results by cffp wfe nexus model according to the statistical yearbook 2019 of xinjiang the total crop area in kaikong watershed is 297 6 103 ha which is larger than the maximized crop area of 203 6 103 ha such differences can be derived from the following reasons i only surface water resources is considered in this study ii the maximized water availability considered in this study is at 15 level of cumulative distribution probability of water availability which is smaller than that of 50 level in 2019 normal year iii only irrigational agriculture is considered in this study which doesn t include non irrigated area reported in statistical yearbook the actual proportion of cotton area is 58 3 in 2019 which falls within the range of 57 8 61 9 in period 1 obtained by the model the optimized electricity generation by cffp wfe nexus model is about 9100 10 200 gwh in period 1 which is smaller than 15 205 gwh in 2019 reported by statistical bulletin of national economic and social development of bmap the statistical bulletin calculated the electricity generation of the whole bmap region however kaikong watershed is a part of the region and the data of three counties luntai qiemo and ruoqiang should be eliminated from the statistical data due to data estimation errors and hypothetical conditions of the model these difference between actual values and model results are acceptable 5 conclusions in this study a chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming cffp method has been proposed through integrating chance constrained programming and fuzzy credibility constrained programming within a fractional programing framework each technique offers a unique contribution towards the enhancement of cffp capabilities of wfe nexus system management under multiple uncertainties cffp can not only tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets with membership functions and random parameters with probabilistic distributions but also optimize the system efficiency represented as output input ratios the cffp method has been applied to planning water food and energy nexus system in kaikong watershed where the objective is to attain maximum water use efficiency between system benefit and water use amount issues of random water availability vague water demand and subjective environmental policy are primarily concerned by the modeling formulation solutions have been generated and used for supporting decisions of a achievement of crop plantation patterns b improvement of electricity generation schemes and c generation of water resources allocation alternatives the results suggest that various uncertainties in system components e g water availability water demands of crop and electricity and pollutant co2 emission mitigation option have sound effects on the watershed s wfe nexus system the system unit water benefit ranges from 0 852 to 0 926 m3 increasing with constraint violation risk corresponding to declined system reliability total crop area is expected to be controlled under 203 4 103 ha in adaptation and mitigation to shrinking water resources at the end of planning horizon vegetable planation is encouraged due to its flexibility in responding to changed water availability and demand as well as its highest unit water benefit the share of electricity generated by coal and gas varies would decline with time and shrinking water resources and restricting pollutant co2 emission allowance at the end of planning horizon fossil energy power should be controlled between 53 1 and 60 4 renewable energy power would be supported for mitigation negative impacts of water and environment water resources allocation patterns are highly related with crop areas and electricity generation demand sided management is required in the future practice these findings have provided optimal strategies for limited resources usage these strategies can help achieve sustainability among water food and energy in a manner targeting water stress and environmental emission these results can also be extended to other regions
