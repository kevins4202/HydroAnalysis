18855,the formation of chlorinated by products is a major concern associated with electrochemical water treatment processes this study investigated the formation of chlorinated by products during surface water treatment by a newly developed electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop the electro peroxone e peroxone process which couples ozonation with in situ electro generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from cathodic oxygen reduction due to the enhanced ozone o3 conversion to hydroxyl radicals oh by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process considerably accelerated the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants such as clofibric acid and chloramphenicol in the selected surface water compared to conventional ozonation in addition the cathodically generated h2o2 effectively quenched hypochlorous acid hocl derived from the anodic oxidation of chloride in the surface water therefore the formation of trichloromethane tcm and chloroacetic acids caas from the reactions of hocl with dissolved organic matter dom was insignificant during the e peroxone process and similar levels of tcm and caas were generally observed in the conventional ozonation and e peroxone treated water in contrast considerable amounts of hocl could be generated from the anodic oxidation of chloride and then accumulated in the surface water during conventional electrolysis process which resulted in significantly higher concentrations of tcm and caas in the electrolysis treated water the results of this study suggest that the e peroxone process can overcome the major limitation of conventional electrochemical processes and provide an effective and safe eaop alternative for micropollutant abatement during water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromate chlorinated by

oxidation process eaop that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in water treatment turkay et al 2017 wang et al 2018b the e peroxone process is enabled by electrochemically producing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from cathodic oxygen o2 reduction during ozonation yuan et al 2013 the in situ generated h2o2 can then enhance the transformation of ozone o3 to hydroxyl radical oh and thus enhance the abatement ozone refractory micropollutants during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation qu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a wu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 2017 2018 in addition because of the faster decomposition of o3 and quenching of hypobromous acid hobr by electro generated h2o2 von gunten and oliveras 1997 the e peroxone process can effectively mitigate bromate bro3 a potential carcinogenic by product formation during the treatment of bromide containing waters as compared to conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 2018 in contrast to conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process which requires the addition of h2o2 stocks during ozonation the e peroxone process can produce h2o2 onsite by using excess o2 present in ozonation the in situ generation of h2o2 on demand avoids the cost and risks associated with the use of h2o2 stocks and enhances the process flexibility considerably von gunten 2018 wang et al 2018a while the e peroxone process can mitigate bromate formation it may increase the risk of chlorinated by product formation during the treatment of chloride containing water chloride is ubiquitously present in natural water with concentrations ranging from several mg l for fresh water to thousands mg l for high salinity water von gunten 2003 cl does not react with o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover although oh can oxidizes cl to cl which can then react with dissolved organic matter dom in the water matrix to form chlorinated by products the reaction of oh with cl is negligible in the typical ph range of water treatment e g 6 9 von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore the formation of chlorinated by products is usually insignificant during water treatment by conventional ozonation von gunten 2003 however the formation of chlorinated by products is a major concern associated with electrochemical water treatment processes garcia segura et al 2018 martinez huitle et al 2015 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 during electrochemical water treatment cl can be electrochemically oxidized to chlorine cl2 at the anode cotillas et al 2015 2018 lin et al 2016 panizza and cerisola 2009 hydrolysis of cl2 leads to the formation of hypochlorous acid hypochlorite hocl ocl i e residual chlorine which can then react with dom to generate chlorinated by products martinez huitle et al 2015 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 as an electrochemically driven process the e peroxone process may thus also generate chlorinated by products that are usually not formed during conventional ozonation the formation of chloride derived by products e g chlorate perchlorate and chlorinated organics during electrochemical water treatment has been investigated previously mainly in anodic oxidation processes bagastyo et al 2012 bergmann et al 2009 garcia segura et al 2015 lin et al 2016 mostafa et al 2018 radjenovic et al 2011a radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however we expect that the formation and speciation of chlorinated by products in the e peroxone process may differ significantly from conventional electrochemical processes e g anodic oxidation because of the combination of electrolysis with ozonation while o3 is unreactive with cl o3 reacts readily with hocl ocl and other chlorine species e g clo2 derived from the anodic oxidation of cl resulting in the formation of chlorine containing by products such as chlorate clo3 lin et al 2016 siddiqui 1996 in addition the electro generated h2o2 can also react with hocl ocl converting them back to cl cotillas et al 2015 held et al 1978 lin et al 2016 furthermore the oxidation of dom with o3 or oh can considerably alter the properties of dom von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and thus significantly influence the formation of chlorinated by products from the reactions of dom with hocl ocl many previous studies have shown that due to the abatement of electron rich moieties of dom by o3 and or oh oxidation pretreatment of source waters by ozonation or oh driven aops can substantially reduce chlorinated disinfection by product dbp formations during post chlorination de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 mao et al 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 because of these potential reactions the formation of chlorinated by products in the e peroxone process may be very different from conventional electrochemical processes and requires further investigation the main objective of this study was to investigate the formation of chlorinated by products when the e peroxone process was applied to abate micropollutants in water treatment a surface water was spiked with several model micropollutants and cl then treated by conventional ozonation electrolysis and the e peroxone process the formation of trichloromethane tcm and chloroacetic acids caas the two most prevalent groups of chlorinated by products that can be formed in electrochemical water treatment radjenovic and sedlak 2015 were evaluated for the three processes due to their adverse effects on human health tcm and caas are classified in the dbp groups of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas respectively which are regulated with a drinking water standard of 80 and 60 μg l in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 the performances of the three processes were compared in terms of micropollutant abatement and by product formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples the model micropollutants tested in this study included diclofenac naproxen gemfibrozil bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid chloramphenicol and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba whose standards purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich see supporting information si table s1 for the properties of the model compounds all dbp standards e g tcm and dcaa were also purchased from sigma aldrich other chemicals e g sodium chloride were obtained from modern eastern fine chemical beijing china and of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω a surface water was collected from a reservoir in the suburban area of beijing the water was filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and then stored at 4 c before it was used for the experiments within one week the main water quality parameters are reported in table 1 the background concentrations of model micropollutants in the selected water were generally lower than 1 μg l in addition the background chloride concentration was also low 5 mg l to better quantitatively evaluate micropollutant abatement and chloride effects on chlorinated by product formation appropriate volumes of micropollutant and chloride stock solutions were spiked into the surface water to achieve an initial concentration of 150 μg l 0 4 1 0 μm for each micropollutant and 30 300 mg l for chloride 2 2 conventional ozonation electrolysis and the e peroxone treatment the selected surface water 600 ml was added in an undivided acrylic column reactor 6 cm inner diameter 25 cm height then treated for 15 min by electrolysis conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process see fig 1 for the reactor scheme wang et al 2015b for electrolysis treatment a pair of electrodes was installed in the reactor the anode was a ruo2 iro2 coated ti ruo2 iro2 ti plate 4 4 cm2 and the cathode was a 316l stainless steel ss plate 4 4 cm2 which cannot produce h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction sudoh et al 1985 wang et al 2015b the distance between the anode and cathode was 1 cm the electrolysis process was conducted under galvanostatic conditions with varying currents in the range of 20 80 ma corresponding to an anodic cathodic current density of 1 25 5 0 ma cm2 for conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process a pure oxygen o2 gas 99 9 was continuously fed into an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada to produce ozone containing oxygen o2 o3 gas which was then bubbled into the reactor at a constant flow rate of 150 ml min o3 concentrations in the sparged o2 o3 gas can be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power for conventional ozonation treatment only gas sparging was applied no electrodes were installed in the reactor for the e peroxone treatment a pair of electrodes was installed in the same way as in electrolysis the anode was the same ruo2 iro2 ti plate used in the electrolysis process however the ss cathode was replaced with a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon ptfe electrode of the same size 4 4 cm2 the carbon ptfe cathode was prepared using the protocol described by wang et al 2012 and can effectively produce h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction wang et al 2015b the e peroxone process was initiated by simultaneously applying a constant current 20 80 ma to electro generate h2o2 at the cathode and bubbling an o2 o3 gas through the reactor all treatments were conducted at 15 c and repeated twice the solution ph did not change considerably 0 1 fluctuations during the electrolysis treatment but increased slightly from 8 0 initial ph to 8 3 during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process which can be possibly attributed to the stripping of co2 from the surface water by continuous o2 o3 gas sparging yao et al 2017 2 3 analytical methods during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatments the gas phase o3 concentrations at the reactor inlet and outlet were monitored using an ozone analyzer bmt 964 ozone systems technology international inc germany and used to calculate the transferred ozone doses during the treatment yao et al 2017 aqueous ozone concentrations were determined with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 residual chlorine was determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd titrimetric method using a hach chlorine detector pocket colorimeter ii bromide and bromate concentrations were measured by ion chromatography metrohm 761 compact ic yao et al 2017 after the treatments sodium thiosulfate was added immediately to quench the residual oxidants thms were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and measured according to the usepa method 551 1 usepa and development 1985 using a gc agilent 7890a santa clara usa equipped with a db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa and an electron capture detector ecd haas were analyzed with a ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc1290 qqq6460 agilent using a slightly modified protocol described by xue et al 2016 the sample injection volume was 40 μl the separation of target haas were performed with a dionex sunnyvale ca usa ionpac as 21 ion exchange column 2 250 mm and an ag 21 guard column 2 50 mm mobile phase a was ultra high purity water and mobile phase b was 200 mm methylamine in ultra high purity water operated under gradient elution micropollutants were analyzed with an ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent lc1290 qqq6460 agilent according to a protocol described elsewhere yao et al 2016 see si for more details for the measurement of dbps and micropollutants 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutant abatement the abatements of selected micropollutants during electrolysis conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment of the selected surface water are compared in fig 2 as shown the concentrations of the selected micropollutants were abated by 10 65 after 15 min electrolysis treatment in comparison conventional ozonation completely abated all selected micropollutants in 15 min with the only exception of chloramphenicol 90 abatement at 15 min by coupling conventional ozonation with electro generation of h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction the e peroxone process considerably accelerated micropollutant abatement in the surface water and completely abated all micropollutants within 10 min during electrolysis micropollutants can be abated via the direct electron transfer at the anode surface i e direct electrolysis and or via the mediated oxidation with electrochemically generated oxidants such as oh and chlorine i e indirect electrolysis panizza and cerisola 2009 the ruo2 iro2 ti anode used in this study has a high oxygen and chlorine evolution activity panizza and cerisola 2009 it is therefore ineffective at generating oh from water discharge but effective at generating chlorine from the anodic oxidation of chloride in the water matrix in the typical ph range of water treatment 6 9 chlorine hydrolyzes quickly to form residual chlorine hocl ocl which can in turn oxidize organics with electron rich moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 as shown in fig 3 with an applied current of 60 ma the concentration of active chlorine increased continuously in the surface water reaching 4 2 mg l at the end of electrolysis treatment correspondingly during electrolysis micropollutants with electron rich moieties e g aniline for diclofenac and anisole naphtalene for naproxen were much faster abated than those without electron rich moieties e g pcba and chloramphenicol fig 2a these observations suggest that mediated oxidation with electro generated chlorine plays a major role in the abatement of micropollutants with electron rich moieties during electrolysis in contrast micropollutants without electron rich moieties could only be abated by direct charge transfer processes at the electrode surface which occurs slowly due to the mass transfer limitation of micropollutants to the anode surface radjenovic et al 2011a wang et al 2018a yao et al 2016 during conventional ozonation micropollutants are mainly abated by oxidation with o3 and or oh generated from natural o3 decomposition in the water matrix von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to their high o3 reactivity k o3 5 104 m 1 s 1 see si table s1 diclofenac naproxen and gemfibrozil were quickly eliminated in 1 min in the surface water fig 2b mainly by the direct oxidation with o3 wang et al 2018a the moderately o3 reactive bezafibrate k o3 590 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 could also be eliminated within 5 min in contrast the elimination of ozone refractory micropollutants ibuprofen clofibric acid pcba and chloramphenicol required much longer reaction time 10 min see fig 2b because they can only be oxidized by oh generated from natural o3 decomposition in the water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for chloramphenicol which has the lowest oh rate constant 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 among the selected micropollutants only 88 abatement was achieved after 15 min of conventional ozonation the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process did not considerably influence the abatement of ozone reactive micropollutants but significantly accelerated the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants fig 2c this observation and can be attributed mainly to the enhanced o3 transfer and o3 transformation to oh in the presence of electro generated h2o2 yao et al 2016 2017 as shown in si fig s1 under the same o2 o3 gas sparging conditions both the gas phase o3 concentration at the reactor outlet and the aqueous o3 concentration in the reactor were considerably lower during the e peroxone process than during the conventional ozonation these differences confirm that more o3 is transferred to the liquid phase and transformed to oh during the e peroxone process than in conventional ozonation due to the enhanced o3 transfer and transformation to oh faster abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants was achieved during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation see si fig s3 for discussion on micropollutant abatements as a function of transferred ozone dose interestingly no residual chlorine hocl ocl was detected in the surface water during the e peroxone treatment data not shown in contrast considerable amounts of h2o2 accumulated fig 4 a therefore mediated oxidation of micropollutants by anodically generated chlorine is expected to be negligible during the e peroxone process the fact that residual chlorine was undetected during the e peroxone process can be probably explained by the quenching of hocl by h2o2 held et al 1978 as shown in fig 4b when a pure o2 gas was sparged during electrolysis 20 80 ma with the carbon ptfe cathode h2o2 could be electrochemically produced from o2 reduction with an apparent current efficiency of 86 90 calculated according to eq 1 in comparison the apparent current efficiency for chlorine production from the anodic oxidation of chloride during electrolysis of the surface water was just 2 8 13 6 calculated according to the residual chlorine concentrations shown in fig 3 and eq 2 even when an anode ruo2 iro2 ti with high chlorine evolution activity was used note that the actual current efficiency for chlorine production may be slightly higher than the apparent current efficiency because evolved chlorine gas was not measured and included in the calculation 1 c e n f c h 2 o 2 v i t 100 2 c e n f c c l 2 v i t 100 where n is the number of electrons consumed for converting o2 to h2o2 or cl to cl2 2 electrons f is the faraday constant 96486 c mol ch2o2 is the concentration of h2o2 mol l ccl2 is the concentration of residual chlorine mol l v is the solution volume l and i is the current a based on the apparent current efficiency observed for h2o2 and cl2 production it is estimated that h2o2 is produced at the cathode at a 6 32 times higher rate than that of chlorine production at the anode during the e peroxone process although a considerable fraction 42 80 of the electro generated h2o2 would then be consumed in the reaction with sparged o3 during the e peroxone process calculated from the difference between h2o2 concentrations during electrolysis with pure o2 sparging fig 4b and during the e peroxone process with o2 o3 gas sparging fig 4a considerable amounts of h2o2 accumulated in the surface water fig 4a at the ph of the surface water 8 0 h2o2 reacts quickly with hocl at an observed second order rate constant of 2870 m 1 s 1 calculated according to eq 3 held et al 1978 which means that the half life time of hocl is only 0 8 8 s for a h2o2 concentration of 1 10 mg l at ph 8 3 k o b s k h o c l h o 2 h k h o c l h k h 2 o 2 k h 2 o 2 h where k h o c l h o 2 is the second order rate constant for the reaction of hocl with ho2 4 4 107 m 1 s 1 held et al 1978 k hocl is the dissociation constant of hocl 2 9 10 8 m deborde and von gunten 2008 k h2o2 is the dissociation constant of h2o2 2 5 10 12 m von gunten and oliveras 1997 due to the fast reaction of hocl with h2o2 the anodically generated hocl will be quickly quenched in the bulk solution by the cathodically generated h2o2 during the e peroxone process therefore in contrast to conventional electrolysis fig 3 no residual chlorine was detected in the surface water during the e peroxone process data not shown the results shown above indicate that by using o2 that always exists in excess in ozonation to electrochemically produce h2o2 the e peroxone process can substantially enhance the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants such as clofibric acid and chloramphenicol meanwhile due to the quenching of hocl by h2o2 significantly lower concentrations of residual chlorine undetected in this study will be accumulated in the water matrix during the e peroxone process compared to conventional electrochemical processes such as anodic oxidation this difference suggests that the e peroxone process may reduce the formation of chlorinated by products from the reactions of hocl clo with dom compared to conventional electrochemical processes 3 2 formation of tcm and caas 3 2 1 effect of applied current fig 5 a shows that with increasing applied currents from 20 to 80 ma the abatement percentage of chloramphenicol the most resistant micropollutants among the selected model compounds was increased from 6 to 14 after 15 min of electrolysis treatment however the increase of currents also enhanced chlorine evolution at the anode and thus resulted in higher residual chlorine concentrations see fig 3 consequently more tcm and caas were formed from the reactions of residual chlorine with dom as the applied currents were increased from 20 to 80 ma during electrolysis fig 4b and c in contrast to electrolysis insignificant concentrations of tcm were formed during conventional ozonation of the selected surface water fig 5b at the ph of the surface water 8 03 the observed rate constant for the oxidation of cl to cl by oh is just about 102 m 1 s 1 von gunten 2003 which is several orders of magnitude lower than the rate constants for the reactions of oh with other water constituents such as dom and carbonate a rough calculation indicates that less than 0 0004 of the oh generated in the system would react with cl 100 mg l in competition with the reactions of oh with the background water constituents see si s3 furthermore cl reacts with dom mainly by electron transfer mechanism which does not generate chlorinated organics remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2015a hence the oxidation of cl to cl by oh and ensuing reactions of cl with dom to chlorinated by products are almost negligible during conventional ozonation of the surface water similarly the formation of tcm was also insignificant during the e peroxone treatment of the surface water fig 5b this result can be mainly attributed to the quenching of residual chlorine by electro generated h2o2 which prevents chlorinated by product formation from the reactions of residual chlorine with dom in the bulk solution with increasing applied currents from 20 to 80 ma the concentration of tcm increased slightly from 0 3 to 1 6 μg l fig 5b this increase can be possibly attributed to the enhanced reactions of dom with residual chlorine in the anode diffuse layer at higher applied currents due to the mass transfer limitation of h2o2 to the anode diffuse layer the anodically generated free chlorine may not be completely quenched by the cathodically generated h2o2 in the anode diffuse layer lin et al 2016 therefore some tcm may be formed in the anode diffuse layer especially when high currents were applied during the e peroxone process nevertheless the data shown in fig 5b suggest that this mechanism will not considerably increase chlorinated by product formation during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation surprisingly high concentrations of dcaa 10 22 μg l were detected in the surface water after conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment fig 5c this observation is unexpected since no residual chlorine was detected in the surface water during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment moreover only dcaa was detected in the ozonation and e peroxone treated water whereas both dcaa and tcaa were detected in the electrolysis treated water this difference suggests that dcaa may be generated via different mechanisms during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process as compared to electrolysis further analysis indicates that during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process dcaa is mainly formed from the oxidative degradation of spiked chloramphenicol as shown in fig 6 chloramphenicol has a carboxamide group which can be cleaved by oh oxidation during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process thus giving rise to dcaa garcia segura et al 2014 this inference was confirmed by the control tests conducted in the selected surface water spiked with or without chloramphenicol see fig 7 when the surface water was not spiked with chloramphenicol only 2 1 3 6 μg l of dcaa was formed during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process possibly from the reaction of dom with cl and or with residual chlorine in the anode diffuse layer in contrast the concentration of dcaa increased considerably to 12 6 18 4 μg l when the surface water was pre spiked with 150 μg l chloramphenicol these observations confirm that during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process dcaa is mainly from the cleavage of c n bond in the carboxamide group of chloramphenicol note that the oxidative degradation of other cl containing micropollutants tested in this study diclofenac bezafibrate and clofibric acid did not form dcaa data now shown it is worth noting that chloramphenicol is typically present at 1 μg l in natural water bu et al 2013 petrie et al 2015 therefore under realistic conditions insignificant dcaa 150 times less than what observed in this study would be formed from chloramphenicol abatement during ozonation and the e peroxone process the concentration of dcaa increased substantially as applied currents were increased from 20 to 80 ma during the e peroxone process fig 5c with increasing applied currents more h2o2 was electrochemically produced at the cathode to enhance o3 transformation to oh during the e peroxone process see fig 4a this in turn increases the chance of the oh induced cleavage of the carboxamide group in chloramphenicol and its transformation products consequently the formation of dcaa increased as the applied currents were increased in the e peroxone process in contrast to conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process which abated 90 100 of the spiked chloramphenicol in the surface water electrolysis abated only 6 14 of the spiked chloramphenicol after 15 min treatment fig 5a therefore the formation of dcaa from chloramphenicol abatement is expected to be insignificant during electrolysis rather the reactions of residual chlorine with dom in the surface water are expected to be the main mechanism for the formation of dcaa as well as tcaa and tcm during electrolysis radjenovic and sedlak 2015 3 2 2 effect of ozone dose similar as increasing applied currents increasing o3 concentrations in the sparged o2 o3 gas enhanced chloramphenicol abatement during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process fig 8 a nevertheless the increase of o3 concentration also increased tcm and dcaa formation during the two processes fig 7b and c these changes can be attributed to the enhanced o3 transfer as the o3 gas concentration is increased see si fig s2 with more o3 transferred from the sparged gas to the water more oh could be produced from the natural or h2o2 induced o3 decomposition to enhance chloramphenicol abatement however the enhanced oh production also resulted in more tcm and dcaa formation from the reactions of cl with dom and the oh induced cleavage of the carboxamide group in chloramphenicol and its transformation products under the same gas sparging conditions higher chloramphenicol abatement percentages were obtained during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation fig 8a which can be attributed to the enhanced o3 transformation to oh in the presence of electro generated h2o2 wang et al 2018a yao et al 2017 corresponding to the higher chloramphenicol abatement higher concentrations of dcaa were detected in the e peroxone treated water than ozonation treated water fig 8c moreover due to the formation of caa from the reaction of dom with anodically generated hocl in the anode diffuse layer slightly higher concentrations of tcm were detected in the e peroxone treated water than in conventional ozonation treated fig 8b 3 2 3 formation of bromide containing by products the above experiments were conducted in the selected surface water without spiking br the background br concentration was 5 2 μg l to better evaluate bromide derived by product formation the surface water was spiked with a br stock solution to achieve a br concentration of 200 μg l the transformation of bromide to bromide containing by products bromate and brominated haas during the electrolysis conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process was then evaluated after 15 min treatment 140 75 and 162 μg l of br were detected in the electrolysis ozonation and e peroxone treated water respectively fig 9 this observation indicates that 30 63 and 19 of the spiked br was transformed to bromide containing by products during electrolysis conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process respectively during electrolysis bromide was mainly transformed to brominated organics such as brominated haas 43 7 μg l while the formation of bromate was insignificant 5 8 μg l in contrast significantly more bromate 153 0 μg l and less brominated haas 13 3 μg l were generated during conventional ozonation for the e peroxone process the formation of both bromate and brominated haas 9 0 and 14 4 μg l respectively was relatively low since only 20 of the spiked br was transformed during the treatment during electrolysis br can be oxidized stepwise to obr bro2 and bro3 at the anode bergmann et al 2011 meanwhile hobr can react rapidly with the bulk organics to form brominated by products bagastyo et al 2012 radjenovic et al 2011b although the concentrations of brominated organics are usually in the low μg l range as shown here for brominated haas because of the low bromide concentrations in most fresh waters their potential risks cannot be neglected due to their high toxicity radjenovic and sedlak 2015 unlike cl br can be oxidized by o3 and or oh to hobr obr and further to bro3 von gunten 2003 due to its potential carcinogenicity bro3 is regulated with a low drinking water standard of 10 μg l in many countries european union 1998 usepa 1998 who 2011 therefore the formation of bro3 has been a major concern associated with o3 based aops during the treatment of bromide containing water especially when high ozone doses are applied to enhance micropollutant abatement von gunten 2003 yao et al 2017 in contrast the formation of brominated organics are usually insignificant in ozone based processes because hobr obr compete with o3 for similar structures in the dom but react slower and are present in much lower concentrations than o3 heeb et al 2014 hua and reckhow 2013 von gunten 2003 consistent with the previous findings mao et al 2018 von gunten 2003 fig 9 shows that a high concentration of bromate was generated during conventional ozonation of the surface water while the formation of brominated haas was relatively low compared with the two previous processes the formation of bromide containing by products bromate and brominated organics was less significant during the e peroxone process fig 9 this observation can be mainly attributed to the quenching of hobr by electro generated h2o2 li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 at the solution ph 8 h2o2 can rapidly reduce hobr back to br at an observed rate constant of 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 von gunten and oliveras 1997 which results in the half life time of hobr to be less 1 s for the h2o2 concentration of 1 mg l therefore the anodically or chemically generated hobr will be quickly quenched by the cathodically generated h2o2 which impedes the formation of brominated organics and bromate during the e peroxone process 3 3 practical implications the results of this study indicate that the in situ electro generation of h2o2 can have multiple beneficial effects on the performance of the e peroxone process for water treatment due to the enhanced transformation of o3 to oh by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process can considerably accelerate the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants than conventional ozonation as a result higher energy efficiency can be achieved for micropollutant abatement during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation see si table s5 for the energy consumption of micropollutant abatement by the different processes furthermore the electro generated h2o2 can effectively quench hocl and hobr that are electrochemically and or chemically produced in the system and thus impede the formation of chlorine and or bromine derived by products from the reactions involving hocl and hobr therefore the e peroxone process can significantly reduce bromate formation compared to conventional ozonation and will not considerably increase the formation of halogenated by products as observed for conventional electrochemical processes as shown in si fig 4 the concentration of tcm formed during the e peroxone process was only 1 6 μg l even when the surface water was spiked with a high chloride concentration of 300 mg l therefore unlike conventional electrochemical processes the formation of chlorinated by products may not be a major concern associated with the e peroxone process for water treatment the strategy of cathodic h2o2 production may also be employed in other electrochemical processes e g anodic oxidation and electrochemical disinfection to mitigate the formation of chlorine derived by products during water treatment currently the most used cathodes in electrochemical processes are metallic electrodes such as stainless steel and titanium during water treatment the main reactions at these metallic cathodes are reduction of water to hydrogen or 4 electron reduction of o2 to h2o martinez huitle et al 2015 in contrast carbon based electrodes favor 2 electron reduction of o2 to h2o2 because of the high overpotential of water reduction and low catalytic activity for h2o2 decomposition of carbon materials hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 therefore by changing the conventional metallic cathodes to carbon based cathodes cathodic o2 to h2o2 can occur at the cathode during electrolysis bakheet et al 2013 martinez huitle et al 2015 due to its weak oxidizing capacity cathodic h2o2 production usually will not considerably enhance pollutant removal during electrolysis unless o3 ferrous ion or uv irradiation is integrated with the electrolysis process to activate h2o2 to oh frangos et al 2016 garcia segura et al 2014 moreira et al 2014 wang et al 2015b however the cathodically generated h2o2 may help to reduce the formation of chlorinated by products by quenching anodically generated free chlorine during electrochemical treatment of chloride containing water lin et al 2016 in addition to being formed from the reactions of dom with hocl hobr halogenated by products may be formed from the oxidative degradation of micropollutants during water treatment krasner 2009 von gunten 2018 the results of this study show that high yields of dcaa can be formed from the oxidative degradation of chloramphenicol during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process 24 36 on a molar basis under the tested conditions 150 μg l chloramphenicol the concentrations of dcaa formed in the conventional ozonation and e peroxone treated surface water 10 23 μg l reached approximately one sixth to one third of the drinking water standard of haas 60 μg l usepa 1998 although such high concentrations of chloramphenicol or other micropollutants are not expected in real waters the results presented herein highlight that the contribution of micropollutants to dbps may become important when treating source waters impacted by multiple micropollutants that can lead to dbps 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate that the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process will not considerably increase the formation of chlorinated dbps during the treatment of chloride containing water even with relatively high cl concentrations and an anode that has high electrocatalytic activity for chlorine evolution the rate of chlorine formation at the anode was much slower than that of h2o2 production from o2 reduction at the cathode due to the quenching of hocl by h2o2 residual chlorine was undetected during the e peroxone treatment of the selected surface water therefore similar levels of tcm and caas were generally observed in the water treated by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process in addition due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition and quenching of hobr by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process significantly reduced the formation of bromate during the treatment of bromide containing water compared to conventional ozonation overall the results indicate that unlike conventional electrochemical processes the formation of halide derived by products are not a major concern

18855,the formation of chlorinated by products is a major concern associated with electrochemical water treatment processes this study investigated the formation of chlorinated by products during surface water treatment by a newly developed electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop the electro peroxone e peroxone process which couples ozonation with in situ electro generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from cathodic oxygen reduction due to the enhanced ozone o3 conversion to hydroxyl radicals oh by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process considerably accelerated the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants such as clofibric acid and chloramphenicol in the selected surface water compared to conventional ozonation in addition the cathodically generated h2o2 effectively quenched hypochlorous acid hocl derived from the anodic oxidation of chloride in the surface water therefore the formation of trichloromethane tcm and chloroacetic acids caas from the reactions of hocl with dissolved organic matter dom was insignificant during the e peroxone process and similar levels of tcm and caas were generally observed in the conventional ozonation and e peroxone treated water in contrast considerable amounts of hocl could be generated from the anodic oxidation of chloride and then accumulated in the surface water during conventional electrolysis process which resulted in significantly higher concentrations of tcm and caas in the electrolysis treated water the results of this study suggest that the e peroxone process can overcome the major limitation of conventional electrochemical processes and provide an effective and safe eaop alternative for micropollutant abatement during water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromate chlorinated by

oxidation process eaop that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in water treatment turkay et al 2017 wang et al 2018b the e peroxone process is enabled by electrochemically producing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from cathodic oxygen o2 reduction during ozonation yuan et al 2013 the in situ generated h2o2 can then enhance the transformation of ozone o3 to hydroxyl radical oh and thus enhance the abatement ozone refractory micropollutants during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation qu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a wu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 2017 2018 in addition because of the faster decomposition of o3 and quenching of hypobromous acid hobr by electro generated h2o2 von gunten and oliveras 1997 the e peroxone process can effectively mitigate bromate bro3 a potential carcinogenic by product formation during the treatment of bromide containing waters as compared to conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 2018 in contrast to conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process which requires the addition of h2o2 stocks during ozonation the e peroxone process can produce h2o2 onsite by using excess o2 present in ozonation the in situ generation of h2o2 on demand avoids the cost and risks associated with the use of h2o2 stocks and enhances the process flexibility considerably von gunten 2018 wang et al 2018a while the e peroxone process can mitigate bromate formation it may increase the risk of chlorinated by product formation during the treatment of chloride containing water chloride is ubiquitously present in natural water with concentrations ranging from several mg l for fresh water to thousands mg l for high salinity water von gunten 2003 cl does not react with o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover although oh can oxidizes cl to cl which can then react with dissolved organic matter dom in the water matrix to form chlorinated by products the reaction of oh with cl is negligible in the typical ph range of water treatment e g 6 9 von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore the formation of chlorinated by products is usually insignificant during water treatment by conventional ozonation von gunten 2003 however the formation of chlorinated by products is a major concern associated with electrochemical water treatment processes garcia segura et al 2018 martinez huitle et al 2015 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 during electrochemical water treatment cl can be electrochemically oxidized to chlorine cl2 at the anode cotillas et al 2015 2018 lin et al 2016 panizza and cerisola 2009 hydrolysis of cl2 leads to the formation of hypochlorous acid hypochlorite hocl ocl i e residual chlorine which can then react with dom to generate chlorinated by products martinez huitle et al 2015 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 as an electrochemically driven process the e peroxone process may thus also generate chlorinated by products that are usually not formed during conventional ozonation the formation of chloride derived by products e g chlorate perchlorate and chlorinated organics during electrochemical water treatment has been investigated previously mainly in anodic oxidation processes bagastyo et al 2012 bergmann et al 2009 garcia segura et al 2015 lin et al 2016 mostafa et al 2018 radjenovic et al 2011a radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however we expect that the formation and speciation of chlorinated by products in the e peroxone process may differ significantly from conventional electrochemical processes e g anodic oxidation because of the combination of electrolysis with ozonation while o3 is unreactive with cl o3 reacts readily with hocl ocl and other chlorine species e g clo2 derived from the anodic oxidation of cl resulting in the formation of chlorine containing by products such as chlorate clo3 lin et al 2016 siddiqui 1996 in addition the electro generated h2o2 can also react with hocl ocl converting them back to cl cotillas et al 2015 held et al 1978 lin et al 2016 furthermore the oxidation of dom with o3 or oh can considerably alter the properties of dom von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and thus significantly influence the formation of chlorinated by products from the reactions of dom with hocl ocl many previous studies have shown that due to the abatement of electron rich moieties of dom by o3 and or oh oxidation pretreatment of source waters by ozonation or oh driven aops can substantially reduce chlorinated disinfection by product dbp formations during post chlorination de vera et al 2016 de vera et al 2015 mao et al 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 because of these potential reactions the formation of chlorinated by products in the e peroxone process may be very different from conventional electrochemical processes and requires further investigation the main objective of this study was to investigate the formation of chlorinated by products when the e peroxone process was applied to abate micropollutants in water treatment a surface water was spiked with several model micropollutants and cl then treated by conventional ozonation electrolysis and the e peroxone process the formation of trichloromethane tcm and chloroacetic acids caas the two most prevalent groups of chlorinated by products that can be formed in electrochemical water treatment radjenovic and sedlak 2015 were evaluated for the three processes due to their adverse effects on human health tcm and caas are classified in the dbp groups of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas respectively which are regulated with a drinking water standard of 80 and 60 μg l in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 the performances of the three processes were compared in terms of micropollutant abatement and by product formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples the model micropollutants tested in this study included diclofenac naproxen gemfibrozil bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid chloramphenicol and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba whose standards purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich see supporting information si table s1 for the properties of the model compounds all dbp standards e g tcm and dcaa were also purchased from sigma aldrich other chemicals e g sodium chloride were obtained from modern eastern fine chemical beijing china and of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω a surface water was collected from a reservoir in the suburban area of beijing the water was filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and then stored at 4 c before it was used for the experiments within one week the main water quality parameters are reported in table 1 the background concentrations of model micropollutants in the selected water were generally lower than 1 μg l in addition the background chloride concentration was also low 5 mg l to better quantitatively evaluate micropollutant abatement and chloride effects on chlorinated by product formation appropriate volumes of micropollutant and chloride stock solutions were spiked into the surface water to achieve an initial concentration of 150 μg l 0 4 1 0 μm for each micropollutant and 30 300 mg l for chloride 2 2 conventional ozonation electrolysis and the e peroxone treatment the selected surface water 600 ml was added in an undivided acrylic column reactor 6 cm inner diameter 25 cm height then treated for 15 min by electrolysis conventional ozonation or the e peroxone process see fig 1 for the reactor scheme wang et al 2015b for electrolysis treatment a pair of electrodes was installed in the reactor the anode was a ruo2 iro2 coated ti ruo2 iro2 ti plate 4 4 cm2 and the cathode was a 316l stainless steel ss plate 4 4 cm2 which cannot produce h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction sudoh et al 1985 wang et al 2015b the distance between the anode and cathode was 1 cm the electrolysis process was conducted under galvanostatic conditions with varying currents in the range of 20 80 ma corresponding to an anodic cathodic current density of 1 25 5 0 ma cm2 for conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process a pure oxygen o2 gas 99 9 was continuously fed into an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada to produce ozone containing oxygen o2 o3 gas which was then bubbled into the reactor at a constant flow rate of 150 ml min o3 concentrations in the sparged o2 o3 gas can be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power for conventional ozonation treatment only gas sparging was applied no electrodes were installed in the reactor for the e peroxone treatment a pair of electrodes was installed in the same way as in electrolysis the anode was the same ruo2 iro2 ti plate used in the electrolysis process however the ss cathode was replaced with a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon ptfe electrode of the same size 4 4 cm2 the carbon ptfe cathode was prepared using the protocol described by wang et al 2012 and can effectively produce h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction wang et al 2015b the e peroxone process was initiated by simultaneously applying a constant current 20 80 ma to electro generate h2o2 at the cathode and bubbling an o2 o3 gas through the reactor all treatments were conducted at 15 c and repeated twice the solution ph did not change considerably 0 1 fluctuations during the electrolysis treatment but increased slightly from 8 0 initial ph to 8 3 during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process which can be possibly attributed to the stripping of co2 from the surface water by continuous o2 o3 gas sparging yao et al 2017 2 3 analytical methods during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatments the gas phase o3 concentrations at the reactor inlet and outlet were monitored using an ozone analyzer bmt 964 ozone systems technology international inc germany and used to calculate the transferred ozone doses during the treatment yao et al 2017 aqueous ozone concentrations were determined with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 residual chlorine was determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd titrimetric method using a hach chlorine detector pocket colorimeter ii bromide and bromate concentrations were measured by ion chromatography metrohm 761 compact ic yao et al 2017 after the treatments sodium thiosulfate was added immediately to quench the residual oxidants thms were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and measured according to the usepa method 551 1 usepa and development 1985 using a gc agilent 7890a santa clara usa equipped with a db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa and an electron capture detector ecd haas were analyzed with a ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc1290 qqq6460 agilent using a slightly modified protocol described by xue et al

mobile phase a was ultra high purity water and mobile phase b was 200 mm methylamine in ultra high purity water operated under gradient elution micropollutants were analyzed with an ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent lc1290 qqq6460 agilent according to a protocol described elsewhere yao et al 2016 see si for more details for the measurement of dbps and micropollutants 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutant abatement the abatements of selected micropollutants during electrolysis conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment of the selected surface water are compared in fig 2 as shown the concentrations of the selected micropollutants were abated by 10 65 after 15 min electrolysis treatment in comparison conventional ozonation completely abated all selected micropollutants in 15 min with the only exception of chloramphenicol 90 abatement at 15 min by coupling conventional ozonation with electro generation of h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction the e peroxone process considerably accelerated micropollutant abatement in the surface water and completely abated all micropollutants within 10 min during electrolysis micropollutants can be abated via the direct electron transfer at the anode surface i e direct electrolysis and or via the mediated oxidation with electrochemically generated oxidants such as oh and chlorine i e indirect electrolysis panizza and cerisola 2009 the ruo2 iro2 ti anode used in this study has a high oxygen and chlorine evolution activity panizza and cerisola 2009 it is therefore ineffective at generating oh from water discharge but effective at generating chlorine from the anodic oxidation of chloride in the water matrix in the typical ph range of water treatment 6 9 chlorine hydrolyzes quickly to form residual chlorine hocl ocl which can in turn oxidize organics with electron rich moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 as shown in fig 3 with an applied current of 60 ma the concentration of active chlorine increased continuously in the surface water reaching 4 2 mg l at the end of electrolysis treatment correspondingly during electrolysis micropollutants with electron rich moieties e g aniline for diclofenac and anisole naphtalene for naproxen were much faster abated than those without electron rich moieties e g pcba and chloramphenicol fig 2a these observations suggest that mediated oxidation with electro generated chlorine plays a major role in the abatement of micropollutants with electron rich moieties during electrolysis in contrast micropollutants without electron rich moieties could only be abated by direct charge transfer processes at the electrode surface which occurs slowly due to the mass transfer limitation of micropollutants to the anode surface radjenovic et al 2011a wang et al 2018a yao et al 2016 during conventional ozonation micropollutants are mainly abated by oxidation with o3 and or oh generated from natural o3 decomposition in the water matrix von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to their high o3 reactivity k o3 5 104 m 1 s 1 see si table s1 diclofenac naproxen and gemfibrozil were quickly eliminated in 1 min in the surface water fig 2b mainly by the direct oxidation with o3 wang et al 2018a the moderately o3 reactive bezafibrate k o3 590 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 could also be eliminated within 5 min in contrast the elimination of ozone refractory micropollutants ibuprofen clofibric acid pcba and chloramphenicol required much longer reaction time 10 min see fig 2b because they can only be oxidized by oh generated from natural o3 decomposition in the water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for chloramphenicol which has the lowest oh rate constant 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 among the selected micropollutants only 88 abatement was achieved after 15 min of conventional ozonation the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process did not considerably influence the abatement of ozone reactive micropollutants but significantly accelerated the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants fig 2c this observation and can be attributed mainly to the enhanced o3 transfer and o3 transformation to oh in the presence of electro generated h2o2 yao et al 2016 2017 as shown in si fig s1 under the same o2 o3 gas sparging conditions both the gas phase o3 concentration at the reactor outlet and the aqueous o3 concentration in the reactor were considerably lower during the e peroxone process than during the conventional ozonation these differences confirm that more o3 is transferred to the liquid phase and transformed to oh during the e peroxone process than in conventional ozonation due to the enhanced o3 transfer and transformation to oh faster abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants was achieved during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation see si fig s3 for discussion on micropollutant abatements as a function of transferred ozone dose interestingly no residual chlorine hocl ocl was detected in the surface water during the e peroxone treatment data not shown in contrast considerable amounts of h2o2 accumulated fig 4 a therefore mediated oxidation of micropollutants by anodically generated chlorine is expected to be negligible during the e peroxone process the fact that residual chlorine was undetected during the e peroxone process can be probably explained by the quenching of hocl by h2o2 held et al 1978 as shown in fig 4b when a pure o2 gas was sparged during electrolysis 20 80 ma with the carbon ptfe cathode h2o2 could be electrochemically produced from o2 reduction with an apparent current efficiency of 86 90 calculated according to eq 1 in comparison the apparent current efficiency for chlorine production from the anodic oxidation of chloride during electrolysis of the surface water was just 2 8 13 6 calculated according to the residual chlorine concentrations shown in fig 3 and eq 2 even when an anode ruo2 iro2 ti with high chlorine evolution activity was used note that the actual current efficiency for chlorine production may be slightly higher than the apparent current efficiency because evolved chlorine gas was not measured and included in the calculation 1 c e n f c h 2 o 2 v i t 100 2 c e n f c c l 2 v i t 100 where n is the number of electrons consumed for converting o2 to h2o2 or cl to cl2 2 electrons f is the faraday constant 96486 c mol ch2o2 is the concentration of h2o2 mol l ccl2 is the concentration of residual chlorine mol l v is the solution volume l and i is the current a based on the apparent current efficiency observed for h2o2 and cl2 production it is estimated that h2o2 is produced at the cathode at a 6 32 times higher rate than that of chlorine production at the anode during the e peroxone process although a considerable fraction 42 80 of the electro generated h2o2 would then be consumed in the reaction with sparged o3 during the e peroxone process calculated from the difference between h2o2 concentrations during electrolysis with pure o2 sparging fig 4b and during the e peroxone process with o2 o3 gas sparging fig 4a considerable amounts of h2o2 accumulated in the surface water fig 4a at the ph of the surface water 8 0 h2o2 reacts quickly with hocl at an observed second order rate constant of 2870 m 1 s 1 calculated according to eq 3 held et al 1978 which means that the half life time of hocl is only 0 8 8 s for a h2o2 concentration of 1 10 mg l at ph 8 3 k o b s k h o c l h o 2 h k h o c l h k h 2 o 2 k h 2 o 2 h where k h o c l h o 2 is the second order rate constant for the reaction of hocl with ho2 4 4 107 m 1 s 1 held et al 1978 k hocl is the dissociation constant of hocl 2 9 10 8 m deborde and von gunten 2008 k h2o2 is the dissociation constant of h2o2 2 5 10 12 m von gunten and oliveras 1997 due to the fast reaction of hocl with h2o2 the anodically generated hocl will be quickly quenched in the bulk solution by the cathodically generated h2o2 during the e peroxone process therefore in contrast to conventional electrolysis fig 3 no residual chlorine was detected in the surface water during the e peroxone process data not shown the results shown above indicate that by using o2 that always exists in excess in ozonation to electrochemically produce h2o2 the e peroxone process can substantially enhance the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants such as clofibric acid and chloramphenicol meanwhile due to the quenching of hocl by h2o2 significantly lower concentrations of residual chlorine undetected in this study will be accumulated in the water matrix during the e peroxone process compared to conventional electrochemical processes such as anodic oxidation this difference suggests that the e peroxone process may reduce the formation of chlorinated by products from the reactions of hocl clo with dom compared to conventional electrochemical processes 3 2 formation of tcm and caas 3 2 1 effect of applied current fig 5 a shows that with increasing applied currents from 20 to 80 ma the abatement percentage of chloramphenicol the most resistant micropollutants among the selected model compounds was increased from 6 to 14 after 15 min of electrolysis treatment however the increase of currents also enhanced chlorine evolution at the anode and thus resulted in higher residual chlorine concentrations see fig 3 consequently more tcm and caas were formed from the reactions of residual chlorine with dom as the applied currents were increased from 20 to 80 ma during electrolysis fig 4b and c in contrast to electrolysis insignificant concentrations of tcm were formed during conventional ozonation of the selected surface water fig 5b at the ph of the surface water 8 03 the observed rate constant for the oxidation of cl to cl by oh is just about 102 m 1 s 1 von gunten 2003 which is several orders of magnitude lower than the rate constants for the reactions of oh with other water constituents such as dom and carbonate a rough calculation indicates that less than 0 0004 of the oh generated in the system would react with cl 100 mg l in competition with the reactions of oh with the background water constituents see si s3 furthermore cl reacts with dom mainly by electron transfer mechanism which does not generate chlorinated organics remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2015a hence the oxidation of cl to cl by oh and ensuing reactions of cl with dom to chlorinated by products are almost negligible during conventional ozonation of the surface water similarly the formation of tcm was also insignificant during the e peroxone treatment of the surface water fig 5b this result can be mainly attributed to the quenching of residual chlorine by electro generated h2o2 which prevents chlorinated by product formation from the reactions of residual chlorine with dom in the bulk solution with increasing applied currents from 20 to 80 ma the concentration of tcm increased slightly from 0 3 to 1 6 μg l fig 5b this increase can be possibly attributed to the enhanced reactions of dom with residual chlorine in the anode diffuse layer at higher applied currents due to the mass transfer limitation of h2o2 to the anode diffuse layer the anodically generated free chlorine may not be completely quenched by the cathodically generated h2o2 in the anode diffuse layer lin et al 2016 therefore some tcm may be formed in the anode diffuse layer especially when high currents were applied during the e peroxone process nevertheless the data shown in fig 5b suggest that this mechanism will not considerably increase chlorinated by product formation during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation surprisingly high concentrations of dcaa 10 22 μg l were detected in the surface water after conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment fig 5c this observation is unexpected since no residual chlorine was detected in the surface water during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone treatment moreover only dcaa was detected in the ozonation and e peroxone treated water whereas both dcaa and tcaa were detected in the electrolysis treated water this difference suggests that dcaa may be generated via different mechanisms during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process as compared to electrolysis further analysis indicates that during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process dcaa is mainly formed from the oxidative degradation of spiked chloramphenicol as shown in fig 6 chloramphenicol has a carboxamide group which can be cleaved by oh oxidation during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process thus giving rise to dcaa garcia segura et al 2014 this inference was confirmed by the control tests conducted in the selected surface water spiked with or without chloramphenicol see fig 7 when the surface water was not spiked with chloramphenicol only 2 1 3 6 μg l of dcaa was formed during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process possibly from the reaction of dom with cl and or with residual chlorine in the anode diffuse layer in contrast the concentration of dcaa increased considerably to 12 6 18 4 μg l when the surface water was pre spiked with 150 μg l chloramphenicol these observations confirm that during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process dcaa is mainly from the cleavage of c n bond in the carboxamide group of chloramphenicol note that the oxidative degradation of other cl containing micropollutants tested in this study diclofenac bezafibrate and clofibric acid did not form dcaa data now shown it is worth noting that chloramphenicol is typically present at 1 μg l in natural water bu et al 2013 petrie et al 2015 therefore under realistic conditions insignificant dcaa 150 times less than what observed in this study would be formed from chloramphenicol abatement during ozonation and the e peroxone process the concentration of dcaa increased substantially as applied currents were increased from 20 to 80 ma during the e peroxone process fig 5c with increasing applied currents more h2o2 was electrochemically produced at the cathode to enhance o3 transformation to oh during the e peroxone process see fig 4a this in turn increases the chance of the oh induced cleavage of the carboxamide group in chloramphenicol and its transformation products consequently the formation of dcaa increased as the applied currents were increased in the e peroxone process in contrast to conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process which abated 90 100 of the spiked chloramphenicol in the surface water electrolysis abated only 6 14 of the spiked chloramphenicol after 15 min treatment fig 5a therefore the formation of dcaa from chloramphenicol abatement is expected to be insignificant during electrolysis rather the reactions of residual chlorine with dom in the surface water are expected to be the main mechanism for the formation of dcaa as well as tcaa and tcm during electrolysis radjenovic and sedlak 2015 3 2 2 effect of ozone dose similar as increasing applied currents increasing o3 concentrations in the sparged o2 o3 gas enhanced chloramphenicol abatement during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process fig 8 a nevertheless the increase of o3 concentration also increased tcm and dcaa formation during the two processes fig 7b and c these changes can be attributed to the enhanced o3 transfer as the o3 gas concentration is increased see si fig s2 with more o3 transferred from the sparged gas to the water more oh could be produced from the natural or h2o2 induced o3 decomposition to enhance chloramphenicol abatement however the enhanced oh production also resulted in more tcm and dcaa formation from the reactions of cl with dom and the oh induced cleavage of the carboxamide group in chloramphenicol and its transformation products under the same gas sparging conditions higher chloramphenicol abatement percentages were obtained during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation fig 8a which can be attributed to the enhanced o3 transformation to oh in the presence of electro generated h2o2 wang et al 2018a yao et al 2017 corresponding to the higher chloramphenicol abatement higher concentrations of dcaa were detected in the e peroxone treated water than ozonation treated water fig 8c moreover due to the formation of caa from the reaction of dom with anodically generated hocl in the anode diffuse layer slightly higher concentrations of tcm were detected in the e peroxone treated water than in conventional ozonation treated fig 8b 3 2 3 formation of bromide containing by products the above experiments were conducted in the selected surface water without spiking br the background br concentration was 5 2 μg l to better evaluate bromide derived by product formation the surface water was spiked with a br stock solution to achieve a br concentration of 200 μg l the transformation of bromide to bromide containing by products bromate and brominated haas during the electrolysis conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process was then evaluated after 15 min treatment 140 75 and 162 μg l of br were detected in the electrolysis ozonation and e peroxone treated water respectively fig 9 this observation indicates that 30 63 and 19 of the spiked br was transformed to bromide containing by products during electrolysis conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process respectively during electrolysis bromide was mainly transformed to brominated organics such as brominated haas 43 7 μg l while the formation of bromate was insignificant 5 8 μg l in contrast significantly more bromate 153 0 μg l and less brominated haas 13 3 μg l were generated during conventional ozonation for the e peroxone process the formation of both bromate and brominated haas 9 0 and 14 4 μg l respectively was relatively low since only 20 of the spiked br was transformed during the treatment during electrolysis br can be oxidized stepwise to obr bro2 and bro3 at the anode bergmann et al 2011 meanwhile hobr can react rapidly with the bulk organics to form brominated by products bagastyo et al 2012 radjenovic et al 2011b although the concentrations of brominated organics are usually in the low μg l range as shown here for brominated haas because of the low bromide concentrations in most fresh waters their potential risks cannot be neglected due to their high toxicity radjenovic and sedlak 2015 unlike cl br can be oxidized by o3 and or oh to hobr obr and further to bro3 von gunten 2003 due to its potential carcinogenicity bro3 is regulated with a low drinking water standard of 10 μg l in many countries european union 1998 usepa 1998 who 2011 therefore the formation of bro3 has been a major concern associated with o3 based aops during the treatment of bromide containing water especially when high ozone doses are applied to enhance micropollutant abatement von gunten 2003 yao et al 2017 in contrast the formation of brominated organics are usually insignificant in ozone based processes because hobr obr compete with o3 for similar structures in the dom but react slower and are present in much lower concentrations than o3 heeb et al 2014 hua and reckhow 2013 von gunten 2003 consistent with the previous findings mao et al 2018 von gunten 2003 fig 9 shows that a high concentration of bromate was generated during conventional ozonation of the surface water while the formation of brominated haas was relatively low compared with the two previous processes the formation of bromide containing by products bromate and brominated organics was less significant during the e peroxone process fig 9 this observation can be mainly attributed to the quenching of hobr by electro generated h2o2 li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 at the solution ph 8 h2o2 can rapidly reduce hobr back to br at an observed rate constant of 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 von gunten and oliveras 1997 which results in the half life time of hobr to be less 1 s for the h2o2 concentration of 1 mg l therefore the anodically or chemically generated hobr will be quickly quenched by the cathodically generated h2o2 which impedes the formation of brominated organics and bromate during the e peroxone process 3 3 practical implications the results of this study indicate that the in situ electro generation of h2o2 can have multiple beneficial effects on the performance of the e peroxone process for water treatment due to the enhanced transformation of o3 to oh by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process can considerably accelerate the abatement of ozone refractory micropollutants than conventional ozonation as a result higher energy efficiency can be achieved for micropollutant abatement during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation see si table s5 for the energy consumption of micropollutant abatement by the different processes furthermore the electro generated h2o2 can effectively quench hocl and hobr that are electrochemically and or chemically produced in the system and thus impede the formation of chlorine and or bromine derived by products from the reactions involving hocl and hobr therefore the e peroxone process can significantly reduce bromate formation compared to conventional ozonation and will not considerably increase the formation of halogenated by products as observed for conventional electrochemical processes as shown in si fig 4 the concentration of tcm formed during the e peroxone process was only 1 6 μg l even when the surface water was spiked with a high chloride concentration of 300 mg l therefore unlike conventional electrochemical processes the formation of chlorinated by products may not be a major concern associated with the e peroxone process for water treatment the strategy of cathodic h2o2 production may also be employed in other electrochemical processes e g anodic oxidation and electrochemical disinfection to mitigate the formation of chlorine derived by products during water treatment currently the most used cathodes in electrochemical processes are metallic electrodes such as stainless steel and titanium during water treatment the main reactions at these metallic cathodes are reduction of water to hydrogen or 4 electron reduction of o2 to h2o martinez huitle et al 2015 in contrast carbon based electrodes favor 2 electron reduction of o2 to h2o2 because of the high overpotential of water reduction and low catalytic activity for h2o2 decomposition of carbon materials hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 therefore by changing the conventional metallic cathodes to carbon based cathodes cathodic o2 to h2o2 can occur at the cathode during electrolysis bakheet et al 2013 martinez huitle et al 2015 due to its weak oxidizing capacity cathodic h2o2 production usually will not considerably enhance pollutant removal during electrolysis unless o3 ferrous ion or uv irradiation is integrated with the electrolysis process to activate h2o2 to oh frangos et al 2016 garcia segura et al 2014 moreira et al 2014 wang et al 2015b however the cathodically generated h2o2 may help to reduce the formation of chlorinated by products by quenching anodically generated free chlorine during electrochemical treatment of chloride containing water lin et al 2016 in addition to being formed from the reactions of dom with hocl hobr halogenated by products may be formed from the oxidative degradation of micropollutants during water treatment krasner 2009 von gunten 2018 the results of this study show that high yields of dcaa can be formed from the oxidative degradation of chloramphenicol during conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process 24 36 on a molar basis under the tested conditions 150 μg l chloramphenicol the concentrations of dcaa formed in the conventional ozonation and e peroxone treated surface water 10 23 μg l reached approximately one sixth to one third of the drinking water standard of haas 60 μg l usepa 1998 although such high concentrations of chloramphenicol or other micropollutants are not expected in real waters the results presented herein highlight that the contribution of micropollutants to dbps may become important when treating source waters impacted by multiple micropollutants that can lead to dbps 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate that the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process will not considerably increase the formation of chlorinated dbps during the treatment of chloride containing water even with relatively high cl concentrations and an anode that has high electrocatalytic activity for chlorine evolution the rate of chlorine formation at the anode was much slower than that of h2o2 production from o2 reduction at the cathode due to the quenching of hocl by h2o2 residual chlorine was undetected during the e peroxone treatment of the selected surface water therefore similar levels of tcm and caas were generally observed in the water treated by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process in addition due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition and quenching of hobr by electro generated h2o2 the e peroxone process significantly reduced the formation of bromate during the treatment of bromide containing water compared to conventional ozonation overall the results indicate that unlike conventional electrochemical processes the formation of halide derived by products are not a major concern

18856,ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led is a newly emerging uv light source with a potential to replace the conventional chemical methods mercury uv lamps and xenon lamps in water disinfection uv leds are characterized by the diversity in wavelengths and can be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency making them an attractive candidate for pulsed light pl disinfection apart from the conventional continuous wave cw operation previous studies on comparison between the pl and cw uv led irradiations for the inactivation of bacterium in water disinfection are limited and results conflict in this work pl and cw uv led in the c spectral band uvc led irradiations were compared at equivalent fluence in the inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation of e coli bacteria in addition effect of different driving currents and ambient temperatures on solder temperature of the pl and cw uvc led irradiation was also examined under the equivalent fluences the pl and cw uvc led irradiations brought comparable inactivation efficiency and similar photoreactivation of the e coli moreover the pl uvc led exhibited a much lower solder temperature than the cw uvc led irradiation on the other hand cw uvc led irradiation higher ambient temperature and higher driving current increased the solder temperature that resulted to a negative impact on the wavelength full width at half maximum optical power and irradiance which are key factors in the uvc led disinfection efficiency in all this work reports the comparison between pl and cw in uvc led irradiation for inactivating e coli bacteria and firstly revealed the photoreactivation of the e coli after the pl uvc leds irradiation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uvc led pulsed light continuous wave irradiation inactivation photoreactivation 1 introduction the safety of water is a serious worldwide issue because using contaminated water can lead to waterborne diseases such as typhoid fever enteric fever rotavirus diarrhea and pandemic disease cholera some of them are leading causes of human death griffiths 2017 woodall 2009 the commonly used chemical methods for water disinfection can lead to introduction of disinfectant resistance to bacteria puzari et al 2018 change of water taste and production of odour wang et al 2018 and harmful disinfection by products that are carcinogenic mutagenic and reproductive toxicants mian et al 2018 therefore the latest uv irradiation with wavelengths in the germicidal range 200 320 nm are attracting extensive attention in future water and wastewater disinfection due to its potential to eliminate the problems associated with the chemical treatment methods kowalski 2009 lange et al 2016 the absorption of uv photons causes changes in the structure of the dna and rna rendering the pathogen incapable of replication and thereby the death of the cell beukers and berends 1960 elmnasser et al 2007 however the currently used mercury uv lamps are characterized with fixed wavelengths and other shortcomings like short bulb lifetime low energy efficiency limited cycling large footprint long warm up time environmental pollution due to mercury and incapability of switching on and off with high frequency vilhunen and sillanpää 2010 the newly emerging ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds outcompete mercury uv in the aforementioned aspects lawal et al 2018 würtele et al 2011 therefore the uv leds have the potential to replace the conventional mercury uv lamps in uv disinfection especially in water treatment as demonstrated in literature crawford et al 2005 ibrahim et al 2014 lui et al 2014 2016 yoshihiko et al 2014 in implementation of uv disinfection the uv light irradiation is either applied in a continuous wave cw or pulsed light pl mode cw uv irradiation has been the commonly used mode which is based on the application of low light intensity of either monochromatic or polychromatic spectra gómez lópez and bolton 2016 on the other hand the pl uv irradiation is a fast non thermal technology for decontamination based on the application of pulses of high intensity of light and broad spectrum 200 1100 nm and rich in uvc 200 280 nm light gómez lópez et al 2007 krishnamurthy et al 2007 the ability of uvc led to be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency makes it especially appropriate for pulsed light pl uvc irradiation although the pl irradiation using a xenon lamp has been reported widely in literature discrepancies still exist in its enhanced inactivation efficiency compared to cw irradiation bohrerova et al 2008 elmnasser et al 2007 gómez lópez et al 2007 moreover the xenon lamps have a high energy demand and are limited in adjusting the duty rates and pulse frequency due to overheating which affects their inactivation efficiency under the pl irradiation gómez lópez et al 2007 in addition the pl irradiation produced by xenon lamps is different from that of uvc leds in terms of emission spectrum intensity pulse frequency and duty rate song et al 2018 therefore the attractive alternative of pl uvc led irradiation is highly expected to replace both the conventional uv mercury lamps and pl xenon lamps in disinfection applications especially in water disinfection li et al 2010 song et al 2018 tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 würtele et al 2011 zou et al 2019 so far there have been a few works touching on the effects of pl and cw leds for water disinfection gillespie et al 2017 li et al 2010 song et al 2018 tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 zou et al 2019 however the outcomes were quite conflict when the pl and cw irradiations were compared in view of the inactivation efficiency some studies showed enhanced inactivation efficiency for pl irradiation whereas some reported comparable results for both kinds of irradiations for inactivation of e coli the enhancement was reported to be 3 8 or 2 5 times using a 272 nm uvc led and a 365 nm uva led respectively li et al 2010 wengraitis et al 2013 in addition the pl uvc leds irradiation was also reported to be 1 8 times more efficient than cw irradiation for inactivating bacillus globigii spores at a wavelength of 269 nm tran et al 2014 in another latest study pl irradiation was reported to be more effective than cw when low power 265 and 280 nm and high power 285 nm uvc leds were used zou et al 2019 however the enhanced inactivation efficiency was clearly observed when a high power 285 nm uva led and a low power 280 nm uvc led driven at higher current were used contrary other recent studies reported different findings in which only comparable rather than enhanced inactivation performance between the pl and cw led irradiation was obtained one was observed by a 405 nm led on hospital pathogen staphylococcus aureus gillespie et al 2017 and the other by a 265 nm uvc led on e coli coliphage ms2 and total coliform in laboratory water and wastewater samples song et al 2018 therefore there exist distinctive discrepancy between pl and cw led irradiation in inactivating bacteria which confuses the application of leds in real disinfection systems furthermore in view of solder temperature that is well known to have an adverse effect on led performance the comparison between pl and cw is quite scarce there was only one paper involving uvc led disinfection that highlighted the superiority of pl over cw uvc led irradiation regarding the waste heat management in which pulse patterns were varied using only a 265 nm uvc led song et al 2018 during led operation about 70 88 of applied electrical power is converted to waste heat which poses a major problem on device life hamidnia et al 2018 additionally the led light wavelength shifts with increasing solder temperature which is a serious concern for led disinfection applications kheyrandish et al 2017 among the cooling methods used for regulating the solder temperature liquid cooling system though expensive has been reported to be an appropriate option for leds compared to other methods e g fans with potential reliability problems petroski 2002 in this study an air conditioner ac inside the working chamber will be used in the disinfection system as a cooling tool and the uvc led were soldered in an aluminum printed circuit board for heat dissipation it therefore demands investigating the effect of pl and cw uvc led in regulating the uvc led solder temperature when the ac is turned off besides it has been indicated in literature that the uv damaged dna of the pathogens can undergo repair by the help of two major repair mechanisms photoreactivation by a photolyase enzyme that requires light of wavelength 330 480 nm and nucleotide excision repair dark repair that is light independent friedberg et al 1995 harm 1980 kelner 1949 the repair of the uv damaged dna of pathogens greatly decreases the disinfection efficiency and thereafter increases the health risks of infection when the uv irradiation is used for water disinfection among the two repair mechanisms photoreactivation is considered as energetically cheaper more direct and a less error prone way of reversing the pyrimidine dimers to their monomeric form compared to the complex multi step pathway of nucleotide excision repair weber 2005 therefore only photoreactivation rather than dark repair will be considered in this work however concerning the effect of pl uvc led irradiation on photoreactivation of bacteria according to our knowledge no research has been reported the only study that reported a residual disinfection effect on antibiotic resistant bacteria the effect was mainly attributed to the tio2 catalyst and not on the pl irradiation when a combination of pl uva led irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm and tio2 coated on a crystallizing dish was used xiong and hu 2013 therefore the actual photoreactivation efficiency after irradiation by a pl uvc led is unknown yet as indicated above in comparison of pl and cw led irradiation in inactivation of microorganisms there are inconsistent results on the inactivation efficiency limited information on solder temperature and lack of study on the effects of pl uvc led in the photoreativation of microorganisms accordingly the objectives of this study are i to compare pl and cw uvc led irradiation at wavelengths of 268 and 275 nm in the inactivation and the subsequent photoreactivation of two different e coli samples a and b ii to investigate effect of the pl and cw uvc led operating in different ambient temperature and driving currents on the solder temperature iii consequently to look into the effect of the solder temperature on the peak wavelength full width at half maximum fwhm optical power and irradiance of the pl and cw uvc led irradiations 2 materials and methods 2 1 culturing and enumeration of microorganisms in this study e coli was chosen as a model microbe because the presence of e coli itself is a good indication on the presence of pathogens and they are a good measure of overall water quality jackson et al 2001 a pure culture of e coli strain cgmcc 1 3373 provided by china general microbiological culture collection centre cgmcc were incubated in a shaker incubator in 100 ml luria bertani lb broth at 37 c and 200 rpm for 5 6 h until late log phase was reached determined by measurement of od600 after culturing the flasks containing the e coli samples were wrapped with aluminum foil and kept in a refrigerator at 4 c unless used immediately two e coli samples a and b were used in this work sample a was cultured and used within the weeks of the current experiment meanwhile sample b had been cultured in advance and kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for around 6 months the cells used during the experiment were collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min and 4 c washed twice with a sterilized saline solution 0 85 and then re suspended in sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml determined by standard plate count method and measurement of od600 through the uv 1780 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan un irradiated n0 and irradiated samples n were collected respectively at time zero and exposure times t s for enumeration both un irradiated and irradiated immediately after irradiation and after exposure to light conditions samples were serially diluted before using the plate streaking technique volumes of 100 μl of the diluted samples were spread on lb agar plate in triplicate for reproducibility of results and incubated while inverted at 37 c for 20 h plates yielding 1 to 300 colonies were considered for analysis deionized water was used for all experiments e g cultivation irradiation and enumeration 2 2 measuring the fluences of uvc leds uvc leds with emissions at 265 and 280 nm and optical powers of 0 88 1 01 mw at currents of 20 20 ma achieved at voltages of 5 7 5 4v respectively at a solder temperature of 25 c great bright company china were used in this work the emission spectra of the uvc leds were measured using a spectro 320 optical scanning spectrometer and exhibited peak emission wavelengths at 268 and 275 nm with fwhm of approximately 12 5 and 10 5 nm respectively fig 1 a the uvc leds were soldered in a 50 mm diameter circular aluminum board for heat dissipation the batch reactor contained nine uvc leds in 24 mm square array consisting of three rows and three columns which were connected in series configuration a magnetic stirrer a 2400 keithley source meter and a microbial sample in a 60 cm diameter petri dish fig 1b the irradiance of the uvc leds was measured at the same microbial suspension surface level using il 1700 radiometer with sed 270 detector international light usa an equivalent fluence of 17 3 mj cm2 was used in this work which was attained from an irradiance of 0 28 mw cm2 and varying pre determined time intervals bolton and linden 2003 gómez lópez and bolton 2016 with the 268 and 275 nm uvc leds driven at constant current of 20 and 17 ma respectively under different frequencies and duty rates provided by the gs610 source measure unit yokogawa japan the petri factors were 0 96 and 0 97 for the 268 nm and 275 nm uvc leds and a reflection factor for water of 0 975 was used the equivalent fluence was calculated as a product of irradiance mw cm2 exposure time s and duty rates zou et al 2019 note that for continuous irradiation the duty rate is 100 therefore the fluence reduces to the product of irradiance mw cm2 and exposure time s bolton and linden 2003 2 3 uvc led irradiation experiments the uvc irradiations were conducted inside a clean chamber pulse frequency is the number of pulse periods on off cycles per unit of time and duty rate is the percentage of irradiation time in an on off cycle pulse frequency 1 5 10 k hz and duty rate 10 25 50 75 90 were adjusted and examined for pl irradiation and compared with cw irradiation the digital oscilloscope zds2022 was used to measure the pulsed waveform for the uvc leds the ac in the clean chamber was turned on during the experiment hence helped to maintain the chamber temperature at around 25 2 c the uvc leds were soldered in an aluminum board for heat dissipation driven at their optimum currents and with the ac in the chamber turned on the solder temperature of the powered uvc leds was maintained at around 26 3 c in this study the two e coli samples a and b were investigated under both pl and cw uvc led irradiations before the inactivation experiments 20 ml of microbial suspension was obtained from the suspended bacteria cells in the sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml 5 ml was taken away for bacterial count and the rest 15 ml was placed in a petri dish with 60 mm diameter 6 mm water depth for irradiation for the uvc leds to reach stable emission stage they were powered on for 5 min before irradiation while being stirred with a sterile magnetic stir bar the microbial suspensions were irradiated at a distance of 30 mm between the microbial suspension surface and the uvc leds for changing the different samples the uvc leds were powered off for less than 30 s which did not have a significant effect on the irradiance for reproducibility of results the experiment was repeated three times samples were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 4 photoreactivation experiments immediately after the inactivation experiment 5 ml of the bacterial sample was transferred into 5 ml glass tube for bacterial count and the rest 10 ml was used to perform the photoreactivation process the photoreactivation was conducted at controlled ambient temperature around 25 2 c since any change in temperature affects the photoreactivation salcedo et al 2007 fluorescent lamp 15 w philips with a peak emission at 395 nm was placed at a distance of 30 cm from the samples the photoreactivation period was 3 h and each photoreactivation experiment was conducted three times control samples were wrapped with aluminum foil after irradiation and kept in the dark both un irradiated samples n0 samples immediately after irradiation n and after photoreactivation nt were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 5 measurement of the solder temperature of the uvc leds high solder temperature can cause overheating of the uv led hence affect its performance or destroy it completely if no proper thermal management is done kheyrandish et al 2017 therefore solder temperature of the powered uvc leds either in pl or cw mode was measured using a tes 1310 type k thermometer with an accuracy of 0 1 c that was placed on the cathode pin of the uvc led and timed for 60 s at 10 s intervals with the ac in the chamber turned off with the solder temperature controlled using a led 850 tec temperature control and keithley 2510 tec source meter the emission spectra and the optical power of the uvc leds were measured using a spectro 320 optical scanning spectrometer meanwhile the irradiance was detected by sed detector whose values were read from programmed computer software and recorded 2 6 calculation 2 6 1 inactivation quantification the inactivation efficiency of e coli was analyzed by calculating log inactivation using eq 1 when required the fluence was determined as earlier explained in section 2 2 1 log inactivation log n 0 n where n0 and n are the colony count cfu ml before and immediately after disinfection respectively 2 6 2 photoreactivation quantification the percentage of photoreactivation of e coli was quantified using eq 2 lindenauer and darby 1994 2 percentage of photoreactivation n t n n 0 n 100 where nt is the cell number after photoreactivation for a period of time t h cfu ml note that the degree of photoreactivation represents the fraction of photoreactivated cells from the inactivated ones anova tukey s post hoc comparison was utilized for demonstrating the difference between the different experimental data sets significant difference was accepted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation under the uvc led irradiation with different pulse patterns as similarly obtained in previous studies gillespie et al 2017 song et al 2018 comparable results under various frequencies and duty rates were also obtained in our work in both pl and cw uvc leds and the two e coli samples a and b fig 2 a and b the observed difference in the log inactivation of e coli was attributed to only the difference in wavelengths in which the 268 nm uv led had a log inactivation of 4 4 which was slightly higher than 4 0 for the 275 nm uv led fig 2a and b the higher inactivation at the 268 nm uv led is attributed to the absorption maximum of the dna of most of the microorganisms that is known to be between 260 and 270 nm as earlier explained gates 1930 it is noted that with an energy exceeding 500 mj cm2 the pl uv irradiation disinfection is achieved through bacterial disruption during their temporary overheating that results from the absorption of a broad band of uv light wekhof 2000 in this work however only the wavelengths in the uvc band were used with a fluence of 17 3 mj cm2 which is much lower than the suggested 500 mj cm2 hence no any expected photothermal or other additional damage that can cause bacterial disruption it is also noted that the killing effects of pathogens by pl light has been attributed to the broad spectrum uv content short duration pulses and the high peak power of the pl from xenon lamps bohrerova et al 2008 dunn 1995 dunn et al 1997 krishnamurthy et al 2007 mcdonald et al 2000 mertens and knorr 1992 wekhof 2000 however the uvc leds in our system had a very low power in the order of mw and a nearly monochromatic spectrum as compared to the high power mw and broad spectrum 200 1100 nm with 25 in the uv of the xenon lamps respectively oms oliu et al 2008 therefore the monochromatic nature the low power and the low fluence supplied from our uvc led system indicates that the inactivation of the e coli observed was mainly due to photochemical effects from the uvc light confirming the comparable inactivation efficiency between pl and cw uvc led irradiations obtained under the equivalent fluence concerning the different e coli samples a and b the inactivation was not significantly different p 0 05 in the pl and cw uvc leds irradiation since the samples underwent similar culturing conditions as described in section 2 1 this also confirms the comparable inactivation efficiency of the pl and cw uvc led irradiations observed in this work our work disagreed with other previous studies that reported enhanced inactivation efficiency by pl over cw uv led irradiation li et al 2010 tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 zou et al 2019 these discrepancies could have been attributed to two factors i unequal fluences of the pl and cw uv led obtained during measurements and ii different power of the uv led used although the conflicting results could arise from the determination methods of fluence as recently argued song et al 2018 it may not be the dominant reason since other earlier reports in literature reveal similar values of the average cw and pl uv fluence delivered when the widely accepted methods ki and ferrioxalate actinometry and spectrometry are used bohrerova et al 2008 it should be noted that even though the actinometry was suggested as the best method in determining the fluence song et al 2018 conflicting results in disinfection efficiency between the pl and cw uvc led irradiations were still reported when the same actinometry was used song et al 2018 zou et al 2019 in one of the studies the inactivation efficiency of the pl irradiation was either equal to or lower than that of cw irradiation at fluence of 4 and 5 mj cm2 for low power 265 and 280 nm uvc leds respectively zou et al 2019 however an enhanced disinfection by the pl over cw irradiation was only observed at fluences 4 and 5 mj cm2 for the 265 and 280 nm uvc leds respectively which is still much lower than the proposed 500 mj cm 2 wekhof 2000 therefore we believe that the enhanced disinfection efficiency could have been due to unequal fluence between the pl and cw irradiation as stated in issue i in the same paper zou et al 2019 when a 5 fold current 100 ma compared with 20 ma was supplied to 280 nm uvc led with an irradiance of 0 03 mw cm2 the pl irradiation led to an enhanced disinfection compared to the cw irradiation however the voltage of the uvc led increased by 1 3 times from 6 2 to 8 v which led to an extra increase of energy consumption although there was an enhanced disinfection efficiency the high driving current is not an appropriate way since the uvc leds themselves can be damaged hence the appropriate method to obtain large fluence is to use high power uv systems as reported earlier krishnamurthy et al 2007 li et al 2010 as also observed and discussed in section 3 3 of this paper the peak wavelength fwhm optical power and irradiance of the uvc led that are essential in uvc led disinfection were negatively affected by an increase in the driving current hence driving uvc leds at higher currents can give misleading results on the disinfection efficiency it is noted that conflicting results were also reported earlier in respect to peak power when other uv sources other than the uvc leds were applied in disinfection experiments in one of the studies in which a flash lamp was used a high peak power of 4655 kw led to a higher killing effect and concentration of eluted protein of s cerevisiae cells compared to a low peak power of 2473 kw takeshita 2003 however in another study no discernible peak power effect was observed when the output of a high peak power uv source at 248 nm from an excimer laser and a low power cw uv source 254 nm were used in the inactivation of b subtilis spores rice and ewell 2001 similarly no difference in the inactivation efficiency was found when pl xenon flash lamp sources that emitted a high energy and wide wavelength intermittently was compared to low pressure uv lamp otaki et al 2003 wang et al 2005 some of these reports otaki et al 2003 takeshita 2003 wang et al 2005 show that the total number of photons delivered is the important parameter and not the number of photons delivered per unit time peak power which is in agreement with the principle of bunsen roscoe reciprocity law sommer et al 1996 however shorter times has been regarded preferential at high irradiance since repair enzymes are more affected than longer time at lower irradiance hence breaking bunsen roscoe reciprocity law sommer et al 1998 therefore if the optical power of the uvc led is much improved the pl uvc led can significantly enhance the disinfection efficiency as earlier explained when a flash lamp was used takeshita 2003 and also in the latest studies in which enhanced and similar disinfection efficiencies were observed when a high power 30 mw output 285 nm zou et al 2019 and a low power 10 mw output 265 nm uvc leds song et al 2018 respectively were used these reports therefore indicate that the discrepancies observed arose from the difference in power of the uv leds used as stated in issue ii above 3 2 photoreactivation after the uvc led irradiation with different pulse patterns the control samples that were wrapped with an aluminum foil and kept in the dark after the pl and cw uvc led inactivation showed insignificant change in the e coli concentration data not shown this observation was similarly reported in previous studies gomez lopez et al 2005 which confirms the dominance of photo effect in the repair of the uv inactivated e coli for the other samples that were exposed to the fluorescent lamp 15 w philips with a peak emission at 395 nm all the e coli samples underwent photoreactivation from the results no significant difference was obtained p 0 05 in the percentage of photoreactivation between the pl and cw uvc led inactivation however it depended strongly on led wavelengths and e coli samples fig 3 a and b the 275 nm uvc led showed lower percentage of photoreactivation compared to the 268 nm uvc leds which is attributed to the damage of proteins that are responsible for infection that show an absorption maximum between 275 and 280 nm as earlier explained schmid 2001 previous studies found photoreactivation of different microorganisms including e coli after a pl treatment using flashes from a stroboscope and a lamp gomez lopez et al 2005 in another study a slower rate of photoreactivation was found after the pl xenon lamp than the cw uv lp lamp treatment however the photoreactivation suppression was assumed to be due to the wider wavelengths of the pl xenon lamp otaki et al 2003 therefore it is believed that at similar inactivation of pathogens by pl and cw uvc led irradiation the repression of photoreactivation is majorly dependent on either wider wavelengths as reported in medium pressure uv lamps kalisvaart 2004 oguma et al 2004 quek and hu 2008 and pulsed xenon lamps otaki et al 2003 or a narrow spectrum peak around 280 nm as found in this work and also reported in refs li et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 from the results obtained sample b revealed a higher percentage of photoreactivation compared to sample a this observation could have been attributed to the photolyase enzyme that is responsible for the repair activity of the uv damaged dna being acclimatized to the long and cold stressful environment therefore the enzyme became more active in repairing the damaged dna of the e coli in sample b as compared to sample a although different microorganisms e coli and legionella pneumophila were used in a previous study oguma et al 2004 at the same log inactivation the latter exhibited a higher photoreactivation than the former and the observation was attributed to a higher photolyase activity in the latter note that photoreactivation seems to be more dependent on the exposure time of the photoreactivating light because the limiting factor of the repair mechanism is the frequency of photolyase to attach to the dimers therefore with the same e coli and same handling procedures on the samples such as cultivation inactivation exposure time of photoreactivating light but the only difference in time of storage the activity of the photolyase enzyme could have played a bigger role in the higher photoreactivation of sample b as explained above however this argument of increase in the activity of the enzyme at low temperatures needs to be investigated further other previous studies demonstrated that e coli populations grown under antecedent growth conditions such as those that more closely approximated natural aquatic environments were more resistant to chlorine disinfection than those grown under commonly employed batch culture conditions berg et al 1982 in addition specific growth rate such as stationary phase or very slowly growing cells and fast growing cells exhibited a high resistance to uvc irradiation compared to bacteria growing at an intermediate rate bucheli witschel et al 2010 however the two samples a and b in this work were cultured under similar laboratory conditions as described in section 2 1 hence the similar inactivation observed therefore the difference in the percentage of photoreactivation could have resulted from the difference in the period of storage in the refrigerator at 4 c before the uvc led irradiations which needs to be investigated further in future studies the observed differences in the photoreactivation percentages of the e coli samples a and b after the uvc irradiations stresses the necessity of using samples cultured and stored under similar conditions for obtaining comparable data on the inactivation and photoreactivation of pathogens therefore to obtain results that can be applied in real life water disinfection situations the pathogens in the laboratory should be grown and stored in antecedent growth conditions such as those that more closely approximate natural aquatic environments 3 3 thermal management of the powered uv leds the cw uvc led irradiation led to a drastic increase in solder temperature from 29 c to 42 c within 60 s on the contrary the solder temperature was much lower for the pl uvc led irradiation at a frequency of 1 khz and varying duty rates ranging from 10 to 90 fig 4 a d note that the heat in the pl irradiation is only generated during the short pulse and there is a cooling period between each pulse which therefore explains the lower solder temperature observed in the pl uvc led as compared to the cw uvc led irradiation in this work with increasing duty rate from 10 to 90 at a constant frequency of 1 khz the solder temperature increased correspondingly with time fig 4a and b however there was no noticeable change in the solder temperature as frequency was changed from 1 khz to 10 khz at 50 duty rate fig 4c and d which was similarly observed in previous studies song et al 2018 this observation indicates that the uvc leds can be driven at a much higher frequency without compromising the solder temperature the solder temperature of the 275 nm uvc led was much lower compared to the 268 nm uvc leds fig 4a d this observation can be attributed to the temperature and current dependent quantum efficiency of the uvc leds it has been shown that the quantum efficiency drops dramatically with decreasing wavelength increasing aluminum content caused by the bad quality of aluminum gallium nitride algan the low carrier density of p type material and the degradation of the optically polarized emission with increasing al content li et al 2018 park et al 2016 in addition at a higher ambient temperature of 29 c fig 4a d the solder temperature increased faster within 60 s of irradiation compared to lower ambient temperature of 25 2 c fig 5 a d this indicates that the ambient temperature under which the uvc led operates in affects its solder temperature it should be noted that increasing the led driving current has a significant implication on the solder temperature as also observed in this work fig 5c and d therefore the uvc leds should be driven at their optimum currents as normally indicated by the manufacturer increasing solder temperature led to a shift in wavelength and broadening in fwhm from 267 7 to 270 1 nm and 11 4 13 4 nm for the 268 nm led and 274 9 275 8 nm and 10 0 11 0 nm for the 275 nm led respectively fig 6 a a similar observation was reported in previous study kheyrandish et al 2017 since the action spectrum of a microorganism is related directly to the led emission spectrum i e wavelength and the fwhm beck et al 2014 chen et al 2009 jagger 1967 mamane gravetz et al 2005 the disinfection efficiency of uvc leds can then be greatly influenced by the solder temperature moreover increasing the solder temperature led to a decrease in the optical power and irradiance from 0 8981 to 0 5695 mw and 0 3197 to 0 0296 mw cm2 for the 268 nm led and 1 012 to 0 8435 mw and 0 0321 to 0 0305 mw cm2 for the 275 nm led respectively fig 6b these temperature induced negative effects has been studied well cao and leboeuf 2007 cao et al 2006 hirayama et al 2015 li et al 2018 shatalov et al 2017 it is also noted that at the same driving current of 20 ma the optical power and irradiance of the 275 nm led was much higher than that of the 268 nm led fig 6a and b this is attributed to the difference in material quality and quantum efficiency as earlier explained li et al 2018 besides because the fluence depends on both irradiance and time bolton and linden 2003 zou et al 2019 the decrease in irradiance will adversely affect the disinfection efficiency at a given irradiation time t s hence without any proper thermal management the disinfection efficiency and life span of uvc leds can greatly be compromised and decreased respectively fortunately with the improvements in material growth and device fabrication shatalov et al 2017 high power uvc leds are highly expected in the near future these uvc leds can then be operated under pl irradiation giving rise to high intensity that will lead to the photo thermal and photo physical effects that together with the photochemical effects from the uvc light have a potential to enhance the inactivation efficiency 4 conclusion pl and cw uvc led irradiations at wavelengths of 268 and 275 nm were compared at equivalent fluences in the inactivation and photoreactivation of two samples of e coli sample a used within 1 week after culturing and b kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for 6 months after culturing and then used afterwards from the findings comparable inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation were observed in both the pl and cw uvc led irradiations as observed in inactivation the photoreactivation was also found to be dependent on the wavelength and not on the pl or cw irradiation modes although samples a and b underwent similar inactivation sample b exhibited a higher percentage of photoreactivation which can be attributed to an increased activity of photolyase enzyme for the e coli stored at 4 c in the refrigerator for around 6 months after culturing in addition to operating uvc leds in their optimum driving currents and in low ambient temperatures the uvc leds in pl mode can also effectively suppress the increase of temperature in the uvc led that is usually associated with cw operation mode by doing so the thermal management can be significantly improved and hence accelerate the application of high output uvc leds for water disinfection conflicts of interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by the national key r d program of china no 2016yfb0400803

18856,ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led is a newly emerging uv light source with a potential to replace the conventional chemical methods mercury uv lamps and xenon lamps in water disinfection uv leds are characterized by the diversity in wavelengths and can be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency making them an attractive candidate for pulsed light pl disinfection apart from the conventional continuous wave cw operation previous studies on comparison between the pl and cw uv led irradiations for the inactivation of bacterium in water disinfection are limited and results conflict in this work pl and cw uv led in the c spectral band uvc led irradiations were compared at equivalent fluence in the inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation of e coli bacteria in addition effect of different driving currents and ambient temperatures on solder temperature of the pl and cw uvc led irradiation was also examined under the equivalent fluences the pl and cw uvc led irradiations brought comparable inactivation efficiency and similar photoreactivation of the e coli moreover the pl uvc led exhibited a much lower solder temperature than the cw uvc led irradiation on the other hand cw uvc led irradiation higher ambient temperature and higher driving current increased the solder temperature that resulted to a negative impact on the wavelength full width at half maximum optical power and irradiance which are key factors in the uvc led disinfection efficiency in all this work reports the comparison between pl and cw in uvc led irradiation for inactivating e coli bacteria and firstly revealed the photoreactivation of the e coli after the pl uvc leds irradiation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uvc led pulsed light continuous wave irradiation inactivation photoreactivation 1 introduction the safety of water is a serious worldwide issue because using contaminated water can lead to waterborne diseases such as typhoid fever enteric fever rotavirus diarrhea and pandemic disease cholera some of them are leading causes of human death griffiths 2017 woodall 2009 the commonly used chemical methods for water disinfection can lead to introduction of disinfectant resistance to bacteria puzari et al 2018 change of water taste and production of odour wang et al 2018 and harmful disinfection by products that are carcinogenic mutagenic and reproductive toxicants mian et al 2018 therefore the latest uv irradiation with wavelengths in the germicidal range 200 320 nm are attracting extensive attention in future water and wastewater disinfection due to its potential to eliminate the problems associated with the chemical treatment methods kowalski 2009 lange et al 2016 the absorption of uv photons causes changes in the structure of the dna and rna rendering the pathogen incapable of replication and thereby the death of the cell beukers and berends 1960 elmnasser et al 2007 however the currently used mercury uv lamps are characterized with fixed wavelengths and other shortcomings like short bulb lifetime low energy efficiency limited cycling large footprint long warm up time environmental pollution due to mercury and incapability of switching on and off with high frequency vilhunen and sillanpää 2010 the newly emerging ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds outcompete mercury uv in the aforementioned aspects lawal et al 2018 würtele et al 2011 therefore the uv leds have the potential to replace the conventional mercury uv lamps in uv disinfection especially in water treatment as demonstrated in literature crawford et al 2005 ibrahim et al 2014 lui et al 2014 2016 yoshihiko et al 2014 in implementation of uv disinfection the uv light irradiation is either applied in a continuous wave cw or pulsed light pl mode cw uv irradiation has been the commonly used mode which is based on the application of low light intensity of either monochromatic or polychromatic spectra gómez lópez and bolton 2016 on the other hand the pl uv irradiation is a fast non thermal technology for decontamination based on the application of pulses of high intensity of light and broad spectrum 200 1100 nm and rich in uvc 200 280 nm light gómez lópez et al 2007 krishnamurthy et al 2007 the ability of uvc led to be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency makes it especially appropriate for pulsed light pl uvc irradiation although the pl irradiation using a xenon lamp has been reported widely in literature discrepancies still exist in its enhanced inactivation efficiency compared to cw irradiation bohrerova et al 2008 elmnasser et al 2007 gómez lópez et al 2007 moreover the xenon lamps have a high energy demand and are limited in adjusting the duty rates and pulse frequency due to overheating which affects their inactivation efficiency under the pl irradiation gómez lópez et al 2007 in addition the pl irradiation produced by xenon lamps is different from that of uvc leds in terms of emission spectrum intensity pulse frequency and duty rate song et al 2018 therefore the attractive alternative of pl uvc led irradiation is highly expected to replace both the conventional uv mercury lamps and pl xenon lamps in disinfection applications especially in water disinfection li et al 2010 song et al 2018 tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 würtele et al 2011 zou et al 2019 so far there have been a few works touching on the effects of pl and cw leds for water disinfection gillespie et al 2017 li et al 2010 song et al 2018 tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 zou et al 2019 however the outcomes were quite conflict when the pl and cw irradiations were compared in view of the inactivation efficiency some studies showed enhanced inactivation efficiency for pl irradiation whereas some reported comparable results for both kinds of irradiations for inactivation of e coli the enhancement was reported to be 3 8 or 2 5 times using a 272 nm uvc led and a 365 nm uva led respectively li et al 2010 wengraitis et al 2013 in addition the pl uvc leds irradiation was also reported to be 1 8 times more efficient than cw irradiation for inactivating bacillus globigii spores at a wavelength of 269 nm tran et al 2014 in another latest study pl irradiation was reported to be more effective than cw when low power 265 and 280 nm and high power 285 nm uvc leds were used zou et al 2019 however the enhanced inactivation efficiency was clearly observed when a high power 285 nm uva led and a low power 280 nm uvc led driven at higher current were used contrary other recent studies reported different findings in which only comparable rather than enhanced inactivation performance between the pl and cw led irradiation was obtained one was observed by a 405 nm led on hospital pathogen staphylococcus aureus gillespie et al 2017 and the other by a 265 nm uvc led on e coli coliphage ms2 and total coliform in laboratory water and wastewater samples song et al 2018 therefore there exist distinctive discrepancy between pl and cw led irradiation in inactivating bacteria which confuses the application of leds in real disinfection systems furthermore in view of solder temperature that is well known to have an adverse effect on led performance the comparison between pl and cw is quite scarce there was only one paper involving uvc led disinfection that highlighted the superiority of pl over cw uvc led irradiation regarding the waste heat management in which pulse patterns were varied using only a 265 nm uvc led song et al 2018 during led operation about 70 88 of applied electrical power is converted to waste heat which poses a major problem on device life hamidnia et al 2018 additionally the led light wavelength shifts with increasing solder temperature which is a serious concern for led disinfection applications kheyrandish et al 2017 among the cooling methods used for regulating the solder temperature liquid cooling system though expensive has been reported to be an appropriate option for leds compared to other methods e g fans with potential reliability problems petroski 2002 in this study an air conditioner ac inside the working chamber will be used in the disinfection system as a cooling tool and the uvc led were soldered in an aluminum printed circuit board for heat dissipation it therefore demands investigating the effect of pl and cw uvc led in regulating the uvc led solder temperature when the ac is turned off besides it has been indicated in literature that the uv damaged dna of the pathogens can undergo repair by the help of two major repair mechanisms photoreactivation by a photolyase enzyme that requires light of wavelength 330 480 nm and nucleotide excision repair dark repair that is light independent friedberg et al 1995 harm 1980 kelner 1949 the repair of the uv damaged dna of pathogens greatly decreases the disinfection efficiency and thereafter increases the health risks of infection when the uv irradiation is used for water disinfection among the two repair mechanisms photoreactivation is considered as energetically cheaper more direct and a less error prone way of reversing the pyrimidine dimers to their monomeric form compared to the complex multi step pathway of nucleotide excision repair weber 2005 therefore only photoreactivation rather than dark repair will be considered in this work however concerning the effect of pl uvc led irradiation on photoreactivation of bacteria according to our knowledge no research has been reported the only study that reported a residual disinfection effect on antibiotic resistant bacteria the effect was mainly attributed to the tio2 catalyst and not on the pl irradiation when a combination of pl uva led irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm and tio2 coated on a crystallizing dish was used xiong and hu 2013 therefore the actual photoreactivation efficiency after irradiation by a pl uvc led is unknown yet as indicated above in comparison of pl and cw led irradiation in inactivation of microorganisms there are inconsistent results on the inactivation efficiency limited information on solder temperature and lack of study on the effects of pl uvc led in the photoreativation of microorganisms accordingly the objectives of this study are i to compare pl and cw uvc led irradiation at wavelengths of 268 and 275 nm in the inactivation and the subsequent photoreactivation of two different e coli samples a and b ii to investigate effect of the pl and cw uvc led operating in different ambient temperature and driving currents on the solder temperature iii consequently to look into the effect of the solder temperature on the peak wavelength full width at half maximum fwhm optical power and irradiance of the pl and cw uvc led irradiations 2 materials and methods 2 1 culturing and enumeration of microorganisms in this study e coli was chosen as a model microbe because the presence of e coli itself is a good indication on the presence of pathogens and they are a good measure of overall water quality jackson et al 2001 a pure culture of e coli strain cgmcc 1 3373 provided by china general microbiological culture collection centre cgmcc were incubated in a shaker incubator in 100 ml luria bertani lb broth at 37 c and 200 rpm for 5 6 h until late log phase was reached determined by measurement of od600 after culturing the flasks containing the e coli samples were wrapped with aluminum foil and kept in a refrigerator at 4 c unless used immediately two e coli samples a and b were used in this work sample a was cultured and used within the weeks of the current experiment meanwhile sample b had been cultured in advance and kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for around 6 months the cells used during the experiment were collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min and 4 c washed twice with a sterilized saline solution 0 85 and then re suspended in sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml determined by standard plate count method and measurement of od600 through the uv 1780 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan un irradiated n0 and irradiated samples n were collected respectively at time zero and exposure times t s for enumeration both un irradiated and irradiated immediately after irradiation and after exposure to light conditions samples were serially diluted before using the plate streaking technique volumes of 100 μl of the diluted samples were spread on lb agar plate in triplicate for reproducibility of results and incubated while inverted at 37 c for 20 h plates yielding 1 to 300 colonies were considered for analysis deionized water was used for all experiments e g cultivation irradiation and enumeration 2 2 measuring the fluences of uvc leds uvc leds with emissions at 265 and 280 nm and optical powers of 0 88 1 01 mw at currents of 20 20 ma achieved at voltages of 5 7 5 4v respectively at a solder temperature of 25 c great bright company china were used in this work the emission spectra of the uvc leds were measured using a spectro 320 optical scanning spectrometer and exhibited peak emission wavelengths at 268 and 275 nm with fwhm of approximately 12 5 and 10 5 nm respectively fig 1 a the uvc leds were soldered in a 50 mm diameter circular aluminum board for heat dissipation the batch reactor contained nine uvc leds in 24 mm square array consisting of three rows and three columns which were connected in series configuration a magnetic stirrer a 2400 keithley source meter and a microbial sample in a 60 cm diameter petri dish fig 1b the irradiance of the uvc leds was measured at the same microbial suspension surface level using il 1700 radiometer with sed 270 detector international light usa an equivalent fluence of 17 3 mj cm2 was used in this work which was attained from an irradiance of 0 28 mw cm2 and varying pre determined time intervals bolton and linden 2003 gómez lópez and bolton 2016 with the 268 and 275 nm uvc leds driven at constant current of 20 and 17 ma respectively under different frequencies and duty rates provided by the gs610 source measure unit yokogawa japan the petri factors were 0 96 and 0 97 for the 268 nm and 275 nm uvc leds and a reflection factor for water of 0 975 was used the equivalent fluence was calculated as a product of irradiance mw cm2 exposure time s and duty rates zou et al 2019 note that for continuous irradiation the duty rate is 100 therefore the fluence reduces to the product of irradiance mw cm2 and exposure time s bolton and linden 2003 2 3 uvc led irradiation experiments the uvc irradiations were conducted inside a clean chamber pulse frequency is the number of pulse periods on off cycles per unit of time and duty rate is the percentage of irradiation time in an on off cycle pulse frequency 1 5 10 k hz and duty rate 10 25 50 75 90 were adjusted and examined for pl irradiation and compared with cw irradiation the digital oscilloscope zds2022 was used to measure the pulsed waveform for the uvc leds the ac in the clean chamber was turned on during the experiment hence helped to maintain the chamber temperature at around 25 2 c the uvc leds were soldered in an aluminum board for heat dissipation driven at their optimum currents and with the ac in the chamber turned on the solder temperature of the powered uvc leds was maintained at around 26 3 c in this study the two e coli samples a and b were investigated under both pl and cw uvc led irradiations before the inactivation experiments 20 ml of microbial suspension was obtained from the suspended bacteria cells in the sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml 5 ml was taken away for bacterial count and the rest 15 ml was placed in a petri dish with 60 mm diameter 6 mm water depth for irradiation for the uvc leds to reach stable emission stage they were powered on for 5 min before irradiation while being stirred with a sterile magnetic stir bar the microbial suspensions were irradiated at a distance of 30 mm between the microbial suspension surface and the uvc leds for changing the different samples the uvc leds were powered off for less than 30 s which did not have a significant effect on the irradiance for reproducibility of results the experiment was repeated three times samples were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 4 photoreactivation experiments immediately after the inactivation experiment 5 ml of the bacterial sample was transferred into 5 ml glass tube for bacterial count and the rest 10 ml was used to perform the photoreactivation process the photoreactivation was conducted at controlled ambient temperature around 25 2 c since any change in temperature affects the photoreactivation salcedo et al 2007 fluorescent lamp 15 w philips with a peak emission at 395 nm was placed at a distance of 30 cm from the samples the photoreactivation period was 3 h and each photoreactivation experiment was conducted three times control samples were wrapped with aluminum foil after irradiation and kept in the dark both un irradiated samples n0 samples immediately after irradiation n and after photoreactivation nt were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 5 measurement of the solder temperature of the uvc leds high solder temperature can cause overheating of the uv led hence affect its performance or destroy it completely if no proper thermal management is done kheyrandish et al 2017 therefore solder temperature of the powered uvc leds either in pl or cw mode was measured using a tes 1310 type k thermometer with an accuracy of 0 1 c that was placed on the cathode pin of the uvc led and timed for 60 s at 10 s intervals with the ac in the chamber turned off with the solder temperature controlled using a led 850 tec temperature control and keithley 2510 tec source meter the emission spectra and the optical power of the uvc leds were measured using a spectro 320 optical scanning spectrometer meanwhile the irradiance was detected by sed detector whose values were read from programmed computer software and recorded 2 6 calculation 2 6 1 inactivation quantification the inactivation efficiency of e coli was analyzed by calculating log inactivation using eq 1 when required the fluence was determined as earlier explained in section 2 2 1 log inactivation log n 0 n where n0 and n are the colony count cfu ml before and immediately after disinfection respectively 2 6 2 photoreactivation quantification the percentage of photoreactivation of e coli was quantified using eq 2 lindenauer and darby 1994 2 percentage of photoreactivation n t n n 0 n 100 where nt is the cell number after photoreactivation for a period of time t h cfu ml note that the degree of photoreactivation represents the fraction of photoreactivated cells from the inactivated ones anova tukey s post hoc comparison was utilized for demonstrating the difference between the different experimental data sets significant difference was accepted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation under the uvc led irradiation with different pulse patterns as similarly obtained in previous studies gillespie et al 2017 song et al 2018 comparable results under various frequencies and duty rates were also obtained in our work in both pl and cw uvc leds and the two e coli samples a and b fig 2 a and b the observed difference in the log inactivation of e coli was attributed to only the difference in wavelengths in which the 268 nm uv led had a log inactivation of 4 4 which was slightly higher than 4 0 for the 275 nm uv led fig 2a and b the higher inactivation at the 268 nm uv led is attributed to the absorption maximum of the dna of most of the microorganisms that is known to be between 260 and 270 nm as earlier explained gates 1930 it is noted that with an energy exceeding 500 mj cm2 the pl uv irradiation disinfection is achieved through bacterial disruption during their temporary overheating that results from the absorption of a broad band of uv light wekhof 2000 in this work however only the wavelengths in the uvc band were used with a fluence of 17 3 mj cm2 which is much lower than the suggested 500 mj cm2 hence no any expected photothermal or other additional damage that can cause bacterial disruption it is also noted that the killing effects of pathogens by pl light has been attributed to the broad spectrum uv content short duration pulses and the high peak power of the pl from xenon lamps bohrerova et al 2008 dunn 1995 dunn et al 1997 krishnamurthy et al 2007 mcdonald et al 2000 mertens and knorr 1992 wekhof 2000 however the uvc leds in our system had a very low power in the order of mw and a nearly monochromatic spectrum as compared to the high power mw and broad spectrum 200 1100 nm with 25 in the uv of the xenon lamps respectively oms oliu et al 2008 therefore the monochromatic nature the low power and the low fluence supplied from our uvc led system indicates that the inactivation of the e coli observed was mainly due to photochemical effects from the uvc light confirming the comparable inactivation efficiency between pl and cw uvc led irradiations obtained under the equivalent fluence concerning the different e coli samples a and b the inactivation was not significantly different p 0 05 in the pl and cw uvc leds irradiation since the samples underwent similar culturing conditions as described in section 2 1 this also confirms the comparable inactivation efficiency of the pl and cw uvc led irradiations observed in this work our work disagreed with other previous studies that reported enhanced inactivation efficiency by pl over cw uv led irradiation li et al 2010 tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 zou et al 2019 these discrepancies could have been attributed to two factors i unequal fluences of the pl and cw uv led obtained during measurements and ii different power of the uv led used although the conflicting results could arise from the determination methods of fluence as recently argued song et al 2018 it may not be the dominant reason since other earlier reports in literature reveal similar values of the average cw and pl uv fluence delivered when the widely accepted methods ki and ferrioxalate actinometry and spectrometry are used bohrerova et al 2008 it should be noted that even though the actinometry was suggested as the best method in determining the fluence song et al 2018 conflicting results in disinfection efficiency between the pl and cw uvc led irradiations were still reported when the same actinometry was used song et al 2018 zou et al 2019 in one of the studies the inactivation efficiency of the pl irradiation was either equal to or lower than that of cw irradiation at fluence of 4 and 5 mj cm2 for low power 265 and 280 nm uvc leds respectively zou et al 2019 however an enhanced disinfection by the pl over cw irradiation was only observed at fluences 4 and 5 mj cm2 for the 265 and 280 nm uvc leds respectively which is still much lower than the proposed 500 mj cm 2 wekhof 2000 therefore we believe that the enhanced disinfection efficiency could have been due to unequal fluence between the pl and cw irradiation as stated in issue i in the same paper zou et al 2019 when a 5 fold current 100 ma compared with 20 ma was supplied to 280 nm uvc led with an irradiance of 0 03 mw cm2 the pl irradiation led to an enhanced disinfection compared to the cw irradiation however the voltage of the uvc led increased by 1 3 times from 6 2 to 8 v which led to an extra increase of energy consumption although there was an enhanced disinfection efficiency the high driving current is not an appropriate way since the uvc leds themselves can be damaged hence the appropriate method to obtain large fluence is to use high power uv systems as reported earlier krishnamurthy et al 2007 li et al 2010 as also observed and discussed in section 3 3 of this paper the peak wavelength fwhm optical power and irradiance of the uvc led that are essential in uvc led disinfection were negatively affected by an increase in the driving current hence driving uvc leds at higher currents can give misleading results on the disinfection efficiency it is noted that conflicting results were also reported earlier in respect to peak power when other uv sources other than the uvc leds were applied in disinfection experiments in one of the studies in which a flash lamp was used a high peak power of 4655 kw led to a higher killing effect and concentration of eluted protein of s cerevisiae cells compared to a low peak power of 2473 kw takeshita 2003 however in another study no discernible peak power effect was observed when the output of a high peak power uv source at 248 nm from an excimer laser and a low power cw uv source 254 nm were used in the inactivation of b subtilis spores rice and ewell 2001 similarly no difference in the inactivation efficiency was found when pl xenon flash lamp sources that emitted a high energy and wide wavelength intermittently was compared to low pressure uv lamp otaki et al 2003 wang et al 2005 some of these reports otaki et al 2003 takeshita 2003 wang et al 2005 show that the total number of photons delivered is the important parameter and not the number of photons delivered per unit time peak power which is in agreement with the principle of bunsen roscoe reciprocity law sommer et al 1996 however shorter times has been regarded preferential at high irradiance since repair enzymes are more affected than longer time at lower irradiance hence breaking bunsen roscoe reciprocity law sommer et al 1998 therefore if the optical power of the uvc led is much improved the pl uvc led can significantly enhance the disinfection efficiency as earlier explained when a flash lamp was used takeshita 2003 and also in the latest studies in which enhanced and similar disinfection efficiencies were observed when a high power 30 mw output 285 nm zou et al 2019 and a low power 10 mw output 265 nm uvc leds song et al 2018 respectively were used these reports therefore indicate that the discrepancies observed arose from the difference in power of the uv leds used as stated in issue ii above 3 2 photoreactivation after the uvc led irradiation with different pulse patterns the control samples that were wrapped with an aluminum foil and kept in the dark after the pl and cw uvc led inactivation showed insignificant change in the e coli concentration data not shown this observation was similarly reported in previous studies gomez lopez et al 2005 which confirms the dominance of photo effect in the repair of the uv inactivated e coli for the other samples that were exposed to the fluorescent lamp 15 w philips with a peak emission at 395 nm all the e coli samples underwent photoreactivation from the results no significant difference was obtained p 0 05 in the percentage of photoreactivation between the pl and cw uvc led inactivation however it depended strongly on led wavelengths and e coli samples fig 3 a and b the 275 nm uvc led showed lower percentage of photoreactivation compared to the 268 nm uvc leds which is attributed to the damage of proteins that are responsible for infection that show an absorption maximum between 275 and 280 nm as earlier explained schmid 2001 previous studies found photoreactivation of different microorganisms including e coli after a pl treatment using flashes from a stroboscope and a lamp gomez lopez et al 2005 in another study a slower rate of photoreactivation was found after the pl xenon lamp than the cw uv lp lamp treatment however the photoreactivation suppression was assumed to be due to the wider wavelengths of the pl xenon lamp otaki et al 2003 therefore it is believed that at similar inactivation of pathogens by pl and cw uvc led irradiation the repression of photoreactivation is majorly dependent on either wider wavelengths as reported in medium pressure uv lamps kalisvaart 2004 oguma et al 2004 quek and hu 2008 and pulsed xenon lamps otaki et al 2003 or a narrow spectrum peak around 280 nm as found in this work and also reported in refs li et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 from the results obtained sample b revealed a higher percentage of photoreactivation compared to sample a this observation could have been attributed to the photolyase enzyme that is responsible for the repair activity of the uv damaged dna being acclimatized to the long and cold stressful environment therefore the enzyme became more active in repairing the damaged dna of the e coli in sample b as compared to sample a although different microorganisms e coli and legionella pneumophila were used in a previous study oguma et al 2004 at the same log inactivation the latter exhibited a higher photoreactivation than the former and the observation was attributed to a higher photolyase activity in the latter note that photoreactivation seems to be more dependent on the exposure time of the photoreactivating light because the limiting factor of the repair mechanism is the frequency of photolyase to attach to the dimers therefore with the same e coli and same handling procedures on the samples such as cultivation inactivation exposure time of photoreactivating light but the only difference in time of storage the activity of the photolyase enzyme could have played a bigger role in the higher photoreactivation of sample b as explained above however this argument of increase in the activity of the enzyme at low temperatures needs to be investigated further other previous studies demonstrated that e coli populations grown under antecedent growth conditions such as those that more closely approximated natural aquatic environments were more resistant to chlorine disinfection than those grown under commonly employed batch culture conditions berg et al 1982 in addition specific growth rate such as stationary phase or very slowly growing cells and fast growing cells exhibited a high resistance to uvc irradiation compared to bacteria growing at an intermediate rate bucheli witschel et al 2010 however the two samples a and b in this work were cultured under similar laboratory conditions as described in section 2 1 hence the similar inactivation observed therefore the difference in the percentage of photoreactivation could have resulted from the difference in the period of storage in the refrigerator at 4 c before the uvc led irradiations which needs to be investigated further in future studies the observed differences in the photoreactivation percentages of the e coli samples a and b after the uvc irradiations stresses the necessity of using samples cultured and stored under similar conditions for obtaining comparable data on the inactivation and photoreactivation of pathogens therefore to obtain results that can be applied in real life water disinfection situations the pathogens in the laboratory should be grown and stored in antecedent growth conditions such as those that more closely approximate natural aquatic environments 3 3 thermal management of the powered uv leds the cw uvc led irradiation led to a drastic increase in solder temperature from 29 c to 42 c within 60 s on the contrary the solder temperature was much lower for the pl uvc led irradiation at a frequency of 1 khz and varying duty rates ranging from 10 to 90 fig 4 a d note that the heat in the pl irradiation is only generated during the short pulse and there is a cooling period between each pulse which therefore explains the lower solder temperature observed in the pl uvc led as compared to the cw uvc led irradiation in this work with increasing duty rate from 10 to 90 at a constant frequency of 1 khz the solder temperature increased correspondingly with time fig 4a and b however there was no noticeable change in the solder temperature as frequency was changed from 1 khz to 10 khz at 50 duty rate fig 4c and d which was similarly observed in previous studies song et al 2018 this observation indicates that the uvc leds can be driven at a much higher frequency without compromising the solder temperature the solder temperature of the 275 nm uvc led was much lower compared to the 268 nm uvc leds fig 4a d this observation can be attributed to the temperature and current dependent quantum efficiency of the uvc leds it has been shown that the quantum efficiency drops dramatically with decreasing wavelength increasing aluminum content caused by the bad quality of aluminum gallium nitride algan the low carrier density of p type material and the degradation of the optically polarized emission with increasing al content li et al 2018 park et al 2016 in addition at a higher ambient temperature of 29 c fig 4a d the solder temperature increased faster within 60 s of irradiation compared to lower ambient temperature of 25 2 c fig 5 a d this indicates that the ambient temperature under which the uvc led operates in affects its solder temperature it should be noted that increasing the led driving current has a significant implication on the solder temperature as also observed in this work fig 5c and d therefore the uvc leds should be driven at their optimum currents as normally indicated by the manufacturer increasing solder temperature led to a shift in wavelength and broadening in fwhm from 267 7 to 270 1 nm and 11 4 13 4 nm for the 268 nm led and 274 9 275 8 nm and 10 0 11 0 nm for the 275 nm led respectively fig 6 a a similar observation was reported in previous study kheyrandish et al 2017 since the action spectrum of a microorganism is related directly to the led emission spectrum i e wavelength and the fwhm beck et al 2014 chen et al 2009 jagger 1967 mamane gravetz et al 2005 the disinfection efficiency of uvc leds can then be greatly influenced by the solder temperature moreover increasing the solder temperature led to a decrease in the optical power and irradiance from 0 8981 to 0 5695 mw and 0 3197 to 0 0296 mw cm2 for the 268 nm led and 1 012 to 0 8435 mw and 0 0321 to 0 0305 mw cm2 for the 275 nm led respectively fig 6b these temperature induced negative effects has been studied well cao and leboeuf 2007 cao et al 2006 hirayama et al 2015 li et al 2018 shatalov et al 2017 it is also noted that at the same driving current of 20 ma the optical power and irradiance of the 275 nm led was much higher than that of the 268 nm led fig 6a and b this is attributed to the difference in material quality and quantum efficiency as earlier explained li et al 2018 besides because the fluence depends on both irradiance and time bolton and linden 2003 zou et al 2019 the decrease in irradiance will adversely affect the disinfection efficiency at a given irradiation time t s hence without any proper thermal management the disinfection efficiency and life span of uvc leds can greatly be compromised and decreased respectively fortunately with the improvements in material growth and device fabrication shatalov et al 2017 high power uvc leds are highly expected in the near future these uvc leds can then be operated under pl irradiation giving rise to high intensity that will lead to the photo thermal and photo physical effects that together with the photochemical effects from the uvc light have a potential to enhance the inactivation efficiency 4 conclusion pl and cw uvc led irradiations at wavelengths of 268 and 275 nm were compared at equivalent fluences in the inactivation and photoreactivation of two samples of e coli sample a used within 1 week after culturing and b kept in a refrigerator at 4 c for 6 months after culturing and then used afterwards from the findings comparable inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation were observed in both the pl and cw uvc led irradiations as observed in inactivation the photoreactivation was also found to be dependent on the wavelength and not on the pl or cw irradiation modes although samples a and b underwent similar inactivation sample b exhibited a higher percentage of photoreactivation which can be attributed to an increased activity of photolyase enzyme for the e coli stored at 4 c in the refrigerator for around 6 months after culturing in addition to operating uvc leds in their optimum driving currents and in low ambient temperatures the uvc leds in pl mode can also effectively suppress the increase of temperature in the uvc led that is usually associated with cw operation mode by doing so the thermal management can be significantly improved and hence accelerate the application of high output uvc leds for water disinfection conflicts of interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by the national key r d program of china no 2016yfb0400803

18857,a simple transparent and reliable method for evaluating non point source pollution npsp risks to drinking water source areas lacking observational data is proposed herein the npsp risks are assessed by using nutrient budget models for total nitrogen and total phosphorus making the best use of remote sensing and field survey data we demonstrate its potential using a case study of the chaihe reservoir in northeastern china fertilizer inputs and crop uptake outputs were estimated based on normalized difference vegetation index which is derived from remote sensing as indicators of crop growth and production the nutrient balances for this area showed surpluses of both n and p within the soil system estimated imbalances per unit area were consistent with statistical relationships derived from all chinese counties demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable the surplus p amounts were higher than the standard threshold for npsp risks indicating the existence of a potential contamination risk of p to this drinking water source graphical abstract image 1037 keywords drinking water source non point source pollution risk nutrient budget remote sensing 1 introduction china s rapid economic development over the past three decades has put pressure on the environment resulting in drinking water resources in china being threatened by anthropogenic contamination he and charlet 2013 a consensus has been reached that non point source pollution npsp is an important contributor to water quality problems in china ongley et al 2010 npsp from agriculture accounts for 57 2 and 67 4 of the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp discharged into the environment on a national basis according to the first national survey of pollution sources in china shi et al 2010 in developing management strategies to protect drinking water sources both point source pollution and npsp need to be assessed however unlike point sources the intermittent nature of npsp makes it more difficult to monitor and control assessing npsp risks to drinking water sources using fast and reliable approaches is now essential to decision makers this remains difficult because of the complexity of npsp leone et al 2009 especially in data sparse regions the nutrient budget model for soil systems is an effective tool for npsp risk assessment and water resource management berka et al 2001 it has been used in many research studies for example lord et al 2010 defined a nutrient balance to assess the risks related to nitrate loss from agricultural lands in the united kingdom sieling and kage 2006 calculated the n balance of an experimental field in germany over a 9 y period they concluded that the n balance provided a good estimate of long term n loss ghebremichael and watzin 2011 built a p balance model for vermont dairy farms and computed the p surplus to identify critical source areas where the p load contributing to lake champlain should be reduced wang et al 2014 evaluated the npsp risk for all counties in china based on nutrient balances these studies indicate that nutrient balance models are easy to use to assess nutrient changes in environmental systems because their inputs and outputs are explicit another advantage of the balance model is that it is suitable for data sparse regions because missing data can be estimated by approximation as described by oenema et al 2003 when additional data becomes available then the model can be easily updated and reviewed in this method the npsp load entering a water body via leaching and runoff is defined as the output components of the nutrient balance it can be estimated using an export coefficient method or a physically based model together with the estimated quantities for other output factors e g crop uptake ammonia volatilization and all input factors e g fertilizer applications atmospheric deposition the difference between total system input and output i e the imbalance of the nutrient budget can be treated as the surplus or deficit of various nutrients within the soil system clearly a surplus indicates enrichment of a given nutrient therefore it can be used as an indicator of potential npsp risk within the system being analyzed in practice application of this method remains a complex and difficult task kettering et al 2012 because the characteristics of npsp depend on many factors such as climate and geophysical setting spatial and temporal scales of assessment data availability and the intensity of human activities oenema et al 2003 within such a framework the imbalance is the unexplained residuals of the input output system however many researchers have indicated that the measurement or calculation of these nutrient balance variables is an inexact process depending upon spatial and temporal variability of nutrient stocks and flows as well as the methods used to describe this variability oenema et al 2003 the inaccuracy of the estimated quantities of input and output components is clearly accumulated in the residuals and weakens their reliability as indicators of npsp risk to reduce uncertainty in nutrient estimates and raise the confidence of such estimates for decision making it is necessary to use more reliable methods for estimating the nutrient budget s components and to address any uncertainty explicitly in china crop production is one of most important factors that must be considered especially when assessing npsp in rural regions yang et al 2012 the fertilizer input to the nutrient budget is usually estimated from cropland area and fertilizer amounts applied to unit areas knowledge of the crop types is crucial to compute this fertilizer amount as the nutrient requirements of different crop types vary significantly simmelsgaard and djurhuus 1998 the landcover classification based on remote sensing images has been widely used to discriminate areas planted with various crop types and to estimate the amount of fertilizer used based on these areas it is usually carried out on a single satellite image however the spectral signature of plants may change during different growth stages such changes likely influence the classification of crop types based on spectral information typically the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi derived from spectral information is used to describe the growth status of vegetation because crops display periodic variations and mutual relationships with environmental conditions several studies have tried to relate the phenological characteristics of crops to changes in their ndvi values to enable better classification of crop types e g foerster et al 2012 lee et al 2016 such remote sensing information is also useful for estimating the output from crop production for the nutrient budget because the amount of nutrients taken up by crops is usually estimated using grain production data when crop yield data are sparse or the boundary of the region of interests varies from the administrative boundary in many cases it may be a basin boundary crop yield models based on multiple ndvi values for different growth periods and historical amounts of crop production have proved to be an effective and rapid means of estimating this information e g quarmby et al 1993 ren et al 2008 son et al 2014 huang et al 2017 considering the issues raised above we propose a method for estimating the annual soil system nutrient imbalance within a drinking water protection zone we use this method to assess the potential npsp risks in a case study of the chaihe reservoir in northeastern china representing a typical reservoir type drinking water source area here the amounts of nutrients in fertilizers and crop uptakes were estimated using remote sensing information along with reasonable estimates of all other input output components to compute the imbalance of the nutrient budget and evaluate the potential npsp risks to this drinking water source sources of uncertainty in the balance model were also considered the paper provides a brief overview of the case study area and the methodology used for assessing the potential npsp risk including the methods used for estimating fertilizer amounts and crop uptake outputs based on satellite data and other input output variables our case results are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the reliability and performance of the model the contribution of this study is that it provides a simple rapid and reliable way for decision makers to evaluate the possible npsp risks to drinking water sources where observational data are sparse 2 study area the chaihe reservoir is situated in the middle reaches of the liaohe river the total storage capacity of this reservoir is 0 636 billion m3 therefore it is an important drinking water source for the prefecture level city of tieling liaoning province in northeastern china it serves a population of 141900 providing 7 38 million m3 of fresh water annually for domestic use the protection zone considered in this study fig 1 consists of the area encompassing the mountain ridge surrounding the reservoir and its upstream drainage area which encloses 11 villages the total area of the protection zone is approximately 90 km2 the major land use types within the protection zone are cropland grassland and forest fig 2 shows that brown soils meadow soils and cinnamon soils are the major soil types in this area according to the chinese soil scientific database http www soil csdb cn these soils are all clay rich soil types the study area has a continental monsoon climate with an annual rainfall of approximately 700 mm y being a rural area crop production and livestock farming drive the growth of the local economy the major crop types are corn and rice with growing seasons extending from april to october in our study the balances of tn and tp were analyzed to assess the npsp risks to the reservoir because the protection zone spans two county level administrative regions tieling county and kaiyuan city fig 1 our assessment was carried out separately for each county level administrative region for the benefit of their respective policy makers 3 methodology and data 3 1 crop classification using remotely sensed data most methods for estimating the amounts of fertilizer applied for crop production require information about the cultivation area in china this is usually obtained from statistical yearbooks because the boundary of the protection zone does not coincide with county level administrative boundaries for which the crop planting areas are listed in the statistical yearbook a method using ndvi values derived from landsat 8 satellite images was adopted the ndvi reflects the greenness of the vegetation and its values changes substantially during seeding growing earing and mature stages of a crop different types of crops have different phenological characteristics during their growing period which can be traced using a time series of ndvi values and subsequently used for crop classification for the protection zone time series of ndvi values during the crop growing season were derived from landsat 8 images with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a high spectral resolution in this region corn and rice are the two main crop types the phenological calendars of these crop types are compared in table 1 in addition two typical sites that have been planted with corn and rice over the past 15 years were identified during our field survey of this region through consultation with local farmers fig 3 time series of the ndvi value in these two typical sites planting corn and rice are shown in fig 4 comparison of the phenological characteristics of corn and rice demonstrates that the heading and mature stages of rice lag behind these same stages in corn this lag is reflected in their ndvi values i e the ndvi value for corn reaches their peak and declines earlier than for rice based on this characteristic a decision tree method was used to identify areas where corn and rice were planted the process used in classifying crop types is shown in fig 5 ndvi values derived from landsat 8 images taken on 6 june 18 july 4 and 20 september were used for crop classification within the case study area these dates were selected because their ndvi values were most effective for identifying crop types using the decision tree method we used several constraints firstly if the ndvi of a pixel on 4 september was lower than 0 15 then it was regarded as a water body otherwise it was considered to represent land secondly july and august are the most important crop growth periods and their ndvi values should be higher than all other period if the ndvi value obtained for 18 july was higher than that obtained for 6 june and the ndvi value of 4 september was higher than that for 20 september then this pixel was identified as cropland finally the time at which peak values occurred was used to identify crop type in this case if the ndvi value of 4 september was larger than that of 18 july then the crop type was identified as rice while if the ndvi value of 18 july was larger than 0 4 then the crop type was identified as corn 3 2 crop yield estimations based on remote sensing data ndvi values derived from satellite images have been widely used to evaluate crop conditions and estimate crop yields the crop yield is estimated using the crop status during important growth stages many studies have used ndvi values of these growth stages to build regression models for estimating crop yields for example quarmby et al 1993 used cumulative ndvi values integrated over the whole growth period huang et al 2017 used the mean ndvi values during best forecast periods that they identified in their study based on these understandings multiple linear regression models describing the relationships between crop yields and ndvi values of different crop growth stages were developed to estimate annual crop yields in this study the multivariate regression model was calibrated using crop yield data from 2003 to 2012 obtained from statistical yearbooks and the average ndvi values of the pixels within the boundary of the prefecture level city of tieling derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data and validated using data for 2013 in the case of rice the tillering heading and mature stages were selected as the three growing stages used to build the statistical crop yield model based on ndvi values for corn the three growth stages considered in the model were the jointing heading and ripening stages the multivariate regression model was formulated as follows 1 y a x1 b x2 c x3 dx4 e x5 f where y is the crop yield of rice or corn per hectare x 1 to x 5 are five ndvi values derived from five satellite images corresponding to the three growing stages listed above for rice or corn while a f are fitting coefficients if the reliability of the model can be guaranteed then it can be applied to estimate crop yields within the protection zone for 2015 using ndvi values from landsat 8 images for various growing stages 3 3 estimation of nutrient balance model components separate nutrient balance models were built for the two parts of the protection zone located in tieling county and kaiyuan city respectively the input components included nutrients sources from the feces of rural residents livestock manure chemical fertilizers and atmospheric deposition the output components consisted of crop uptake ammonia volatilization and denitrification as well as losses via leaching and runoff 3 3 1 input from the feces of rural residents and livestock villages are scattered throughout the protection zone this high level of dispersion means that the percentage of rural sewage being treated is low with the development of livestock farming animal dung is another important source of npsp in this region the tn and tp of feces from rural residents and livestock were computed using the excretion coefficient method 2 n r u r a l n u m p o p e x c h u m a n n 3 p r u r a l n u m p o p e x c h u m a n p 4 n l i v e s t o c k i 1 n n u m i e x c i n 5 p l i v e s t o c k i 1 n n u m i e x c i p where n rural p rural n livestock and p livestock are the amounts of tn and tp from feces of rural residents and livestock manures respectively in eqs 2 and 3 num pop is the population of the study area obtained from the statistical yearbook exc human n and exc human p are the annual excretion coefficients per capita from literature values for this region liu et al 2011 with values of 1 58 kg and 0 16 kg for tn and tp respectively in eqs 4 and 5 n is the number of livestock categories and num i is the number of animals in the ith livestock category both obtained from the statistical yearbook exc i n and exc i p are the excretion coefficients of tp and tn for the ith livestock category with values obtained from liu et al 2011 all the information required to compute the excretion amounts of tn and tp from rural resident and livestock is listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively some of the feces from rural residents and livestock are used as organic fertilizers in agriculture the return coefficients of tn and tp α and β were set to 56 0 and 66 7 according to the results of a questionnaire survey in this case αn rural αp rural βn livestock and βp livestock were their respective tn and tp contributions to organic fertilizers thus the remaining portions 1 α n rural 1 α p rural 1 β n livestock and 1 β p livestock were the amounts discharged to the soil system as pollution 3 3 2 inputs from mineral fertilizers used in agricultural production based on the areas planted with corn and rice estimated using remote sensing based method section 3 1 and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area derived from the statistical yearbooks the quantity of total fertilizer is computed field surveys conducted within the protection zone indicated that most farmers used nitrogen fertilizers phosphate fertilizers and compound fertilizers which generally include urea calcium superphosphate and potassium sulfate fertilizer n p2o5 and k2o respectively using the proportion of each kind of fertilizer applied and their purity table 4 the inputs of tn and tp from fertilizers were calculated 3 3 3 inputs from atmospheric deposition as an outcome of human activities that emit n compounds atmospheric n deposition has increased gradually to levels that influence terrestrial ecosystems zhou et al 2015 typically ammonia volatilized from farmland has a short residence time in the atmosphere and is returned to the surrounding areas via dry and wet deposition processes the atmospheric precipitation coefficient used for tn was 16 kg ha while it was 0 58 kg ha for tp based on recommendations in peng et al 2004 and wang et al 2014 respectively 3 3 4 output related to crop uptake nutrients taken up by crops represent a major nutrient output from the soil system a simple nutrient uptake coefficient method based on crop yield was used to compute the amounts of tn and tp absorbed by crops the yields of rice and corn were estimated using the remote sensing method described in section 3 2 while their uptake amounts per product were specified in the literature national agricultural technical extension 1999 3 3 5 ammonia volatilization and denitrification outputs we explicitly addressed losses related to both ammonia volatilization and denitrification in this study we set the loss rate related to ammonia volatilization from fertilizers to 11 schwenke et al 2014 while the lost rate from denitrification was set to 13 korsaeth and eltun 2000 xing and zhu 2000 3 3 6 leaching and runoff outputs nutrient losses via leaching and runoff contributed to npsp of the reservoir they are typically the only sources of npsp considered in a balance model the outputs related to leaching and runoff were estimated using the export coefficient method which computes these losses according to the area of each landcover type and its corresponding nutrient export coefficient in this study the losses from corn and rice cropland were computed based on the cultivation area determined from remote sensing section 3 1 we used the export coefficients from wang et al 2014 for northeastern china as listed in table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimates of crop planting area and crop yield based on remote sensing the remote sensing method indicates that 36 8 and 1 2 of the study area was cultivated for corn and rice production in 2015 fig 6 respectively these values are consistent with prefecture level values for tieling listed in the 2015 statistical yearbook 29 6 4 6 this concordance supports the reliability of the remote sensing method used to classify crop types within the part of the protection zone belonging to tieling county the cultivation areas of corn and rice were 2899 4 ha and 88 3 ha respectively meanwhile the corn and rice cultivation areas in the protection zone belonging to kaiyuan city were 3145 3 ha and 111 1 ha respectively these respective areas were used to compute the quantities of chemical fertilizer crop yields and nutrient uptakes by these crops to estimate crop yields the multivariate linear regression models for each crop type were calibrated using crop yield data covering the period from 2003 to 2012 available from the statistical yearbooks these data give equations y 9922 6x 1 7488 8x 2 3504 7x 3 11916 4x 4 12673 8x 5 654 2 and y 9375 7x 1 1307 7x 2 1534 1x 3 43206 5x 4 12443 5x 5 9474 5 for corn and rice production respectively the relative errors in estimation of corn and rice crop yields were 0 96 and 0 58 respectively using these regression models to predict corn and rice production for 2013 the relative errors were determined to be 1 37 and 8 18 when compared with data from the 2013 statistical yearbook not used in the model calibration the satisfactory performance of these crop yield models for 2013 increased our confidence in the model which was used to estimate corn and rice production for 2015 in 2015 the estimated corn and rice yields were 10426 9 kg ha and 8639 4 kg ha respectively based on crop area and unit yields derived from remote sensing the corn and rice crop yields for each administrative part of the protection zone were estimated to be 30231 6 t and 762 8 t for tieling county and 32795 4 t and 959 7 t for kaiyuan city respectively 4 2 inputs and outputs of the nutrient budget the compositions of the nutrient inputs and outputs for the protection zone areas belonging to tieling county and kaiyuan city are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the total inputs of n and p in the part of the protection zone belonging to tieling county were 1125 7 t and 193 8 t the corresponding inputs for the part belonging to kaiyuan city were 1249 6 t and 229 0 t clearly chemical fertilizers contributed most to nutrient inputs followed by amounts contributed by atmospheric deposition and organic fertilizers derived from human and livestock feces only 4 8 and 11 7 of the n and p applied to crops was from organic fertilizer this value is lower than the national average for 2010 wang et al 2014 the total outputs of n and p were 1923 4 t and 246 4 t respectively of these outputs crop uptake made the greatest contribution followed by losses from leaching and runoff these outputs were the main contributors to npsp in the reservoir before we calculated nutrient loadings and nutrient imbalances using the nutrient budget to evaluate npsp risks to the protection zone we needed to address several uncertainty issues to ensure confidence in these data the uncertainty in the residual of the nutrient balance i e the difference between the sum of input and output components was determined by estimating the uncertainties of all its components oenema and heinen 1999 showed that highest uncertainty comes from estimating nutrient losses via leaching runoff volatilization and denitrification followed by inputs from animal manure and atmospheric deposition and outputs by crop uptake estimation of the inputs of mineral fertilizers had the lowest uncertainty among these factors to address the uncertainty of estimating the imbalance in a quantitative manner we estimated the uncertainties of all components in the nutrient balance following the recommendations of oenema and heinen 1999 we assumed uncertainties of 20 for the estimated nutrient losses via leaching runoff volatilization and denitrification 15 for nutrients derived from animal manure atmospheric deposition or removed as harvested crops and 5 for nutrients in mineral fertilizers these values defined the lower and upper boundaries of the uncertainty for these model components which were used to recompute the nutrient balances the imbalances obtained using the original budget model and those incorporating these uncertainties are listed in table 6 these imbalances show nutrient surpluses regardless of whether uncertainties were considered or not indicating that nutrients are accumulating within the soil systems of this zone 4 3 non point source pollution loading and potential risks analyzing the differences between the total nutrient input and output revealed that a nutrient surplus exists within this drinking water protection zone the enrichments in tn and tp for the area within tieling county were 918 3 t and 117 9 t for 2015 while their corresponding values for the area within kaiyuan city were 1005 0 t and 128 5 t respectively to evaluate the reliability of our estimates the magnitude of the surplus per unit area was compared with values estimated based on statistical relationships between fertilizer amounts and nutrient balances determined within 2464 chinese counties in 2010 wang et al 2014 we used the fertilizer amount applied within the protection zone as input to the statistical relationships table 7 shows that the estimates derived using the nutrient balance model proposed in this study have the same order of magnitude as those obtained using the statistical relationships the consistency in estimates obtained using two independent methods suggests that our estimates are reliable such accumulation of nutrients within the soil system has the potential to become npsp via runoff and leaching in subsequent years leading to a certain level of risk however consensus on a reference level to assess this risk is hard to achieve this is because it depends on the complexity and variability of nutrient movements within the soil system here we use the reference level recommended by oenema et al 2003 i e for n surpluses we used a value of 100 kg ha per year for clayey soil the main soil type within the protection zone clearly even considering the uncertainties in all components the imbalances in tn in both counties were lower than 100 kg ha table 6 for p surpluses 8 7 kg ha per year was set as the tentative reference level oenema et al 2003 regardless of soil type and land use in this case both parts of the protection zone had p surpluses higher than this reference value regardless of whether uncertainties in the nutrient budget were considered or not therefore the two parts of the protection zone show a potential npsp risk related to tp within the reservoir indicating the method of applying p fertilizers to crop production needs to be re evaluated within this zone to protect this drinking water source the annual surplus is an indicator of potential risk it is not equal to the pollution load which is difficult to estimate within the study area because of the lack of observational data to move our discussion one more step further toward real risk i e related to the pollution load within the protection zone we followed the method proposed by mishima et al 2009 in this method the difference between annual precipitation and annual evapotranspiration is treated as excess water in this case the tn or tp concentrations from surplus tn or tp in the excess water are computed as an indicator of the risks of contamination in this way water availability for transporting nutrients within the protection zone is considered in the risk assessment in our case study we used the mean value of available annual precipitation for 2011 2015 from the water resources bulletin of liaoning province china we also used the mean value of available annual evapotranspiration for 2011 2015 obtained from the modis satellite data product of myd16a2 available at https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis modis products table myd16a2 v006 for the area within tieling county the tn and tp concentrations computed were 11 6 and 4 25 mg l while for the area within kaiyuan city the computed tn and tp concentrations were 15 0 and 6 16 mg l clearly the computed tn and tp concentrations are not equivalent to the concentrations of nutrients in the water body however to evaluate the npsp risk more intuitively we compared these computed concentrations with the upper limits of tp and tn for drinking water protection zones given by the chinese environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 within the tieling county area the tn and tp concentrations were 11 6 and 21 3 times higher than the surface water standard meanwhile within the kaiyuan county area the tn and tp concentrations were 15 0 and 30 8 times higher than the surface water standard we found that tp concentrations exceeded the water quality standard by more than the tn concentrations this indicates that the potential npsp risk related to tp is higher than that for tn consistent with our conclusions drawn based on results of the nutrient budget method model for this protection zone from the results of our assessments we could demonstrate that the risk is higher in the part of protection zone within kaiyuan city than for the area within tieling county however tieling county encompasses the mountain ridge surrounding the reservoir and consequently is closer to the drinking water source area than kaiyuan city which covers the upstream drainage area of the reservoir to evaluate the risk at finer spatial scales than the county level assessment conducted in this study more observational data or numerical modeling of nutrient movement would be necessary however we have shown the nutrient budget model outlined herein is suitable for assessing the npsp risks to drinking water sources that lack observational data because approximations can be made based on information from the literature or expert knowledge clearly the uncertainty related to these approximations can be reduced as new observational data become available 5 conclusions this study proposes a simple rapid and reliable method for estimating potential npsp risks using residuals of the nutrient budget for reservoir type drinking water sources that lack observational data for such estimations this nutrient balance method uses remote sensing data to compute fertilizer input and crop uptake values in the nutrient budget results of our case study showed that the relative error of the remote sensing based crop yield model was less than 10 n and p are all surpluses at the annual scale within the study area these surpluses had the same order of magnitude when estimated using an independent statistical model suggesting that the imbalances computed using the nutrient model were reliable we could show that surplus p within the soil system posed a potential npsp risk to this drinking water source acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

18857,a simple transparent and reliable method for evaluating non point source pollution npsp risks to drinking water source areas lacking observational data is proposed herein the npsp risks are assessed by using nutrient budget models for total nitrogen and total phosphorus making the best use of remote sensing and field survey data we demonstrate its potential using a case study of the chaihe reservoir in northeastern china fertilizer inputs and crop uptake outputs were estimated based on normalized difference vegetation index which is derived from remote sensing as indicators of crop growth and production the nutrient balances for this area showed surpluses of both n and p within the soil system estimated imbalances per unit area were consistent with statistical relationships derived from all chinese counties demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable the surplus p amounts were higher than the standard threshold for npsp risks indicating the existence of a potential contamination risk of p to this drinking water source graphical abstract image 1037 keywords drinking water source non point source pollution risk nutrient budget remote sensing 1 introduction china s rapid economic development over the past three decades has put pressure on the environment resulting in drinking water resources in china being threatened by anthropogenic contamination he and charlet 2013 a consensus has been reached that non point source pollution npsp is an important contributor to water quality problems in china ongley et al 2010 npsp from agriculture accounts for 57 2 and 67 4 of the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp discharged into the environment on a national basis according to the first national survey of pollution sources in china shi et al 2010 in developing management strategies to protect drinking water sources both point source pollution and npsp need to be assessed however unlike point sources the intermittent nature of npsp makes it more difficult to monitor and control assessing npsp risks to drinking water sources using fast and reliable approaches is now essential to decision makers this remains difficult because of the complexity of npsp leone et al 2009 especially in data sparse regions the nutrient budget model for soil systems is an effective tool for npsp risk assessment and water resource management berka et al 2001 it has been used in many research studies for example lord et al 2010 defined a nutrient balance to assess the risks related to nitrate loss from agricultural lands in the united kingdom sieling and kage 2006 calculated the n balance of an experimental field in germany over a 9 y period they concluded that the n balance provided a good estimate of long term n loss ghebremichael and watzin 2011 built a p balance model for vermont dairy farms and computed the p surplus to identify critical source areas where the p load contributing to lake champlain should be reduced wang et al 2014 evaluated the npsp risk for all counties in china based on nutrient balances these studies indicate that nutrient balance models are easy to use to assess nutrient changes in environmental systems because their inputs and outputs are explicit another advantage of the balance model is that it is suitable for data sparse regions because missing data can be estimated by approximation as described by oenema et al 2003 when additional data becomes available then the model can be easily updated and reviewed in this method the npsp load entering a water body via leaching and runoff is defined as the output components of the nutrient balance it can be estimated using an export coefficient method or a physically based model together with the estimated quantities for other output factors e g crop uptake ammonia volatilization and all input factors e g fertilizer applications atmospheric deposition the difference between total system input and output i e the imbalance of the nutrient budget can be treated as the surplus or deficit of various nutrients within the soil system clearly a surplus indicates enrichment of a given nutrient therefore it can be used as an indicator of potential npsp risk within the system being analyzed in practice application of this method remains a complex and difficult task kettering et al 2012 because the characteristics of npsp depend on many factors such as climate and geophysical setting spatial and temporal scales of assessment data availability and the intensity of human activities oenema et al 2003 within such a framework the imbalance is the unexplained residuals of the input output system however many researchers have indicated that the measurement or calculation of these nutrient balance variables is an inexact process depending upon spatial and temporal variability of nutrient stocks and flows as well as the methods used to describe this variability oenema et al 2003 the inaccuracy of the estimated quantities of input and output components is clearly accumulated in the residuals and weakens their reliability as indicators of npsp risk to reduce uncertainty in nutrient estimates and raise the confidence of such estimates for decision making it is necessary to use more reliable methods for estimating the nutrient budget s components and to address any uncertainty explicitly in china crop production is one of most important factors that must be considered especially when assessing npsp in rural regions yang et al 2012 the fertilizer input to the nutrient budget is usually estimated from cropland area and fertilizer amounts applied to unit areas knowledge of the crop types is crucial to compute this fertilizer amount as the nutrient requirements of different crop types vary significantly simmelsgaard and djurhuus 1998 the landcover classification based on remote sensing images has been widely used to discriminate areas planted with various crop types and to estimate the amount of fertilizer used based on these areas it is usually carried out on a single satellite image however the spectral signature of plants may change during different growth stages such changes likely influence the classification of crop types based on spectral information typically the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi derived from spectral information is used to describe the growth status of vegetation because crops display periodic variations and mutual relationships with environmental conditions several studies have tried to relate the phenological characteristics of crops to changes in their ndvi values to enable better classification of crop types e g foerster et al 2012 lee et al 2016 such remote sensing information is also useful for estimating the output from crop production for the nutrient budget because the amount of nutrients taken up by crops is usually estimated using grain production data when crop yield data are sparse or the boundary of the region of interests varies from the administrative boundary in many cases it may be a basin boundary crop yield models based on multiple ndvi values for different growth periods and historical amounts of crop production have proved to be an effective and rapid means of estimating this information e g quarmby et al 1993 ren et al 2008 son et al 2014 huang et al 2017 considering the issues raised above we propose a method for estimating the annual soil system nutrient imbalance within a drinking water protection zone we use this method to assess the potential npsp risks in a case study of the chaihe reservoir in northeastern china representing a typical reservoir type drinking water source area here the amounts of nutrients in fertilizers and crop uptakes were estimated using remote sensing information along with reasonable estimates of all other input output components to compute the imbalance of the nutrient budget and evaluate the potential npsp risks to this drinking water source sources of uncertainty in the balance model were also considered the paper provides a brief overview of the case study area and the methodology used for assessing the potential npsp risk including the methods used for estimating fertilizer amounts and crop uptake outputs based on satellite data and other input output variables our case results are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the reliability and performance of the model the contribution of this study is that it provides a simple rapid and reliable way for decision makers to evaluate the possible npsp risks to drinking water sources where observational data are sparse 2 study area the chaihe reservoir is situated in the middle reaches of the liaohe river the total storage capacity of this reservoir is 0 636 billion m3 therefore it is an important drinking water source for the prefecture level city of tieling liaoning province in northeastern china it serves a population of 141900 providing 7 38 million m3 of fresh water annually for domestic use the protection zone considered in this study fig 1 consists of the area encompassing the mountain ridge surrounding the reservoir and its upstream drainage area which encloses 11 villages the total area of the protection zone is approximately 90 km2 the major land use types within the protection zone are cropland grassland and forest fig 2 shows that brown soils meadow soils and cinnamon soils are the major soil types in this area according to the chinese soil scientific database http www soil csdb cn these soils are all clay rich soil types the study area has a continental monsoon climate with an annual rainfall of approximately 700 mm y being a rural area crop production and livestock farming drive the growth of the local economy the major crop types are corn and rice with growing seasons extending from april to october in our study the balances of tn and tp were analyzed to assess the npsp risks to the reservoir because the protection zone spans two county level administrative regions tieling county and kaiyuan city fig 1 our assessment was carried out separately for each county level administrative region for the benefit of their respective policy makers 3 methodology and data 3 1 crop classification using remotely sensed data most methods for estimating the amounts of fertilizer applied for crop production require information about the cultivation area in china this is usually obtained from statistical yearbooks because the boundary of the protection zone does not coincide with county level administrative boundaries for which the crop planting areas are listed in the statistical yearbook a method using ndvi values derived from landsat 8 satellite images was adopted the ndvi reflects the greenness of the vegetation and its values changes substantially during seeding growing earing and mature stages of a crop different types of crops have different phenological characteristics during their growing period which can be traced using a time series of ndvi values and subsequently used for crop classification for the protection zone time series of ndvi values during the crop growing season were derived from landsat 8 images with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a high spectral resolution in this region corn and rice are the two main crop types the phenological calendars of these crop types are compared in table 1 in addition two typical sites that have been planted with corn and rice over the past 15 years were identified during our field survey of this region through consultation with local farmers fig 3 time series of the ndvi value in these two typical sites planting corn and rice are shown in fig 4 comparison of the phenological characteristics of corn and rice demonstrates that the heading and mature stages of rice lag behind these same stages in corn this lag is reflected in their ndvi values i e the ndvi value for corn reaches their peak and declines earlier than for rice based on this characteristic a decision tree method was used to identify areas where corn and rice were planted the process used in classifying crop types is shown in fig 5 ndvi values derived from landsat 8 images taken on 6 june 18 july 4 and 20 september were used for crop classification within the case study area these dates were selected because their ndvi values were most effective for identifying crop types using the decision tree method we used several constraints firstly if the ndvi of a pixel on 4 september was lower than 0 15 then it was regarded as a water body otherwise it was considered to represent land secondly july and august are the most important crop growth periods and their ndvi values should be higher than all other period if the ndvi value obtained for 18 july was higher than that obtained for 6 june and the ndvi value of 4 september was higher than that for 20 september then this pixel was identified as cropland finally the time at which peak values occurred was used to identify crop type in this case if the ndvi value of 4 september was larger than that of 18 july then the crop type was identified as rice while if the ndvi value of 18 july was larger than 0 4 then the crop type was identified as corn 3 2 crop yield estimations based on remote sensing data ndvi values derived from satellite images have been widely used to evaluate crop conditions and estimate crop yields the crop yield is estimated using the crop status during important growth stages many studies have used ndvi values of these growth stages to build regression models for estimating crop yields for example quarmby et al 1993 used cumulative ndvi values integrated over the whole growth period huang et al 2017 used the mean ndvi values during best forecast periods that they identified in their study based on these understandings multiple linear regression models describing the relationships between crop yields and ndvi values of different crop growth stages were developed to estimate annual crop yields in this study the multivariate regression model was calibrated using crop yield data from 2003 to 2012 obtained from statistical yearbooks and the average ndvi values of the pixels within the boundary of the prefecture level city of tieling derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data and validated using data for 2013 in the case of rice the tillering heading and mature stages were selected as the three growing stages used to build the statistical crop yield model based on ndvi values for corn the three growth stages considered in the model were the jointing heading and ripening stages the multivariate regression model was formulated as follows 1 y a x1 b x2 c x3 dx4 e x5 f where y is the crop yield of rice or corn per hectare x 1 to x 5 are five ndvi values derived from five satellite images corresponding to the three growing stages listed above for rice or corn while a f are fitting coefficients if the reliability of the model can be guaranteed then it can be applied to estimate crop yields within the protection zone for 2015 using ndvi values from landsat 8 images for various growing stages 3 3 estimation of nutrient balance model components separate nutrient balance models were built for the two parts of the protection zone located in tieling county and kaiyuan city respectively the input components included nutrients sources from the feces of rural residents livestock manure chemical fertilizers and atmospheric deposition the output components consisted of crop uptake ammonia volatilization and denitrification as well as losses via leaching and runoff 3 3 1 input from the feces of rural residents and livestock villages are scattered throughout the protection zone this high level of dispersion means that the percentage of rural sewage being treated is low with the development of livestock farming animal dung is another important source of npsp in this region the tn and tp of feces from rural residents and livestock were computed using the excretion coefficient method 2 n r u r a l n u m p o p e x c h u m a n n 3 p r u r a l n u m p o p e x c h u m a n p 4 n l i v e s t o c k i 1 n n u m i e x c i n 5 p l i v e s t o c k i 1 n n u m i e x c i p where n rural p rural n livestock and p livestock are the amounts of tn and tp from feces of rural residents and livestock manures respectively in eqs 2 and 3 num pop is the population of the study area obtained from the statistical yearbook exc human n and exc human p are the annual excretion coefficients per capita from literature values for this region liu et al 2011 with values of 1 58 kg and 0 16 kg for tn and tp respectively in eqs 4 and 5 n is the number of livestock categories and num i is the number of animals in the ith livestock category both obtained from the statistical yearbook exc i n and exc i p are the excretion coefficients of tp and tn for the ith livestock category with values obtained from liu et al 2011 all the information required to compute the excretion amounts of tn and tp from rural resident and livestock is listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively some of the feces from rural residents and livestock are used as organic fertilizers in agriculture the return coefficients of tn and tp α and β were set to 56 0 and 66 7 according to the results of a questionnaire survey in this case αn rural αp rural βn livestock and βp livestock were their respective tn and tp contributions to organic fertilizers thus the remaining portions 1 α n rural 1 α p rural 1 β n livestock and 1 β p livestock were the amounts discharged to the soil system as pollution 3 3 2 inputs from mineral fertilizers used in agricultural production based on the areas planted with corn and rice estimated using remote sensing based method section 3 1 and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area derived from the statistical yearbooks the quantity of total fertilizer is computed field surveys conducted within the protection zone indicated that most farmers used nitrogen fertilizers phosphate fertilizers and compound fertilizers which generally include urea calcium superphosphate and potassium sulfate fertilizer n p2o5 and k2o respectively using the proportion of each kind of fertilizer applied and their purity table 4 the inputs of tn and tp from fertilizers were calculated 3 3 3 inputs from atmospheric deposition as an outcome of human activities that emit n compounds atmospheric n deposition has increased gradually to levels that influence terrestrial ecosystems zhou et al 2015 typically ammonia volatilized from farmland has a short residence time in the atmosphere and is returned to the surrounding areas via dry and wet deposition processes the atmospheric precipitation coefficient used for tn was 16 kg ha while it was 0 58 kg ha for tp based on recommendations in peng et al 2004 and wang et al 2014 respectively 3 3 4 output related to crop uptake nutrients taken up by crops represent a major nutrient output from the soil system a simple nutrient uptake coefficient method based on crop yield was used to compute the amounts of tn and tp absorbed by crops the yields of rice and corn were estimated using the remote sensing method described in section 3 2 while their uptake amounts per product were specified in the literature national agricultural technical extension 1999 3 3 5 ammonia volatilization and denitrification outputs we explicitly addressed losses related to both ammonia volatilization and denitrification in this study we set the loss rate related to ammonia volatilization from fertilizers to 11 schwenke et al 2014 while the lost rate from denitrification was set to 13 korsaeth and eltun 2000 xing and zhu 2000 3 3 6 leaching and runoff outputs nutrient losses via leaching and runoff contributed to npsp of the reservoir they are typically the only sources of npsp considered in a balance model the outputs related to leaching and runoff were estimated using the export coefficient method which computes these losses according to the area of each landcover type and its corresponding nutrient export coefficient in this study the losses from corn and rice cropland were computed based on the cultivation area determined from remote sensing section 3 1 we used the export coefficients from wang et al 2014 for northeastern china as listed in table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimates of crop planting area and crop yield based on remote sensing the remote sensing method indicates that 36 8 and 1 2 of the study area was cultivated for corn and rice production in 2015 fig 6 respectively these values are consistent with prefecture level values for tieling listed in the 2015 statistical yearbook 29 6 4 6 this concordance supports the reliability of the remote sensing method used to classify crop types within the part of the protection zone belonging to tieling county the cultivation areas of corn and rice were 2899 4 ha and 88 3 ha respectively meanwhile the corn and rice cultivation areas in the protection zone belonging to kaiyuan city were 3145 3 ha and 111 1 ha respectively these respective areas were used to compute the quantities of chemical fertilizer crop yields and nutrient uptakes by these crops to estimate crop yields the multivariate linear regression models for each crop type were calibrated using crop yield data covering the period from 2003 to 2012 available from the statistical yearbooks these data give equations y 9922 6x 1 7488 8x 2 3504 7x 3 11916 4x 4 12673 8x 5 654 2 and y 9375 7x 1 1307 7x 2 1534 1x 3 43206 5x 4 12443 5x 5 9474 5 for corn and rice production respectively the relative errors in estimation of corn and rice crop yields were 0 96 and 0 58 respectively using these regression models to predict corn and rice production for 2013 the relative errors were determined to be 1 37 and 8 18 when compared with data from the 2013 statistical yearbook not used in the model calibration the satisfactory performance of these crop yield models for 2013 increased our confidence in the model which was used to estimate corn and rice production for 2015 in 2015 the estimated corn and rice yields were 10426 9 kg ha and 8639 4 kg ha respectively based on crop area and unit yields derived from remote sensing the corn and rice crop yields for each administrative part of the protection zone were estimated to be 30231 6 t and 762 8 t for tieling county and 32795 4 t and 959 7 t for kaiyuan city respectively 4 2 inputs and outputs of the nutrient budget the compositions of the nutrient inputs and outputs for the protection zone areas belonging to tieling county and kaiyuan city are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the total inputs of n and p in the part of the protection zone belonging to tieling county were 1125 7 t and 193 8 t the corresponding inputs for the part belonging to kaiyuan city were 1249 6 t and 229 0 t clearly chemical fertilizers contributed most to nutrient inputs followed by amounts contributed by atmospheric deposition and organic fertilizers derived from human and livestock feces only 4 8 and 11 7 of the n and p applied to crops was from organic fertilizer this value is lower than the national average for 2010 wang et al 2014 the total outputs of n and p were 1923 4 t and 246 4 t respectively of these outputs crop uptake made the greatest contribution followed by losses from leaching and runoff these outputs were the main contributors to npsp in the reservoir before we calculated nutrient loadings and nutrient imbalances using the nutrient budget to evaluate npsp risks to the protection zone we needed to address several uncertainty issues to ensure confidence in these data the uncertainty in the residual of the nutrient balance i e the difference between the sum of input and output components was determined by estimating the uncertainties of all its components oenema and heinen 1999 showed that highest uncertainty comes from estimating nutrient losses via leaching runoff volatilization and denitrification followed by inputs from animal manure and atmospheric deposition and outputs by crop uptake estimation of the inputs of mineral fertilizers had the lowest uncertainty among these factors to address the uncertainty of estimating the imbalance in a quantitative manner we estimated the uncertainties of all components in the nutrient balance following the recommendations of oenema and heinen 1999 we assumed uncertainties of 20 for the estimated nutrient losses via leaching runoff volatilization and denitrification 15 for nutrients derived from animal manure atmospheric deposition or removed as harvested crops and 5 for nutrients in mineral fertilizers these values defined the lower and upper boundaries of the uncertainty for these model components which were used to recompute the nutrient balances the imbalances obtained using the original budget model and those incorporating these uncertainties are listed in table 6 these imbalances show nutrient surpluses regardless of whether uncertainties were considered or not indicating that nutrients are accumulating within the soil systems of this zone 4 3 non point source pollution loading and potential risks analyzing the differences between the total nutrient input and output revealed that a nutrient surplus exists within this drinking water protection zone the enrichments in tn and tp for the area within tieling county were 918 3 t and 117 9 t for 2015 while their corresponding values for the area within kaiyuan city were 1005 0 t and 128 5 t respectively to evaluate the reliability of our estimates the magnitude of the surplus per unit area was compared with values estimated based on statistical relationships between fertilizer amounts and nutrient balances determined within 2464 chinese counties in 2010 wang et al 2014 we used the fertilizer amount applied within the protection zone as input to the statistical relationships table 7 shows that the estimates derived using the nutrient balance model proposed in this study have the same order of magnitude as those obtained using the statistical relationships the consistency in estimates obtained using two independent methods suggests that our estimates are reliable such accumulation of nutrients within the soil system has the potential to become npsp via runoff and leaching in subsequent years leading to a certain level of risk however consensus on a reference level to assess this risk is hard to achieve this is because it depends on the complexity and variability of nutrient movements within the soil system here we use the reference level recommended by oenema et al 2003 i e for n surpluses we used a value of 100 kg ha per year for clayey soil the main soil type within the protection zone clearly even considering the uncertainties in all components the imbalances in tn in both counties were lower than 100 kg ha table 6 for p surpluses 8 7 kg ha per year was set as the tentative reference level oenema et al 2003 regardless of soil type and land use in this case both parts of the protection zone had p surpluses higher than this reference value regardless of whether uncertainties in the nutrient budget were considered or not therefore the two parts of the protection zone show a potential npsp risk related to tp within the reservoir indicating the method of applying p fertilizers to crop production needs to be re evaluated within this zone to protect this drinking water source the annual surplus is an indicator of potential risk it is not equal to the pollution load which is difficult to estimate within the study area because of the lack of observational data to move our discussion one more step further toward real risk i e related to the pollution load within the protection zone we followed the method proposed by mishima et al 2009 in this method the difference between annual precipitation and annual evapotranspiration is treated as excess water in this case the tn or tp concentrations from surplus tn or tp in the excess water are computed as an indicator of the risks of contamination in this way water availability for transporting nutrients within the protection zone is considered in the risk assessment in our case study we used the mean value of available annual precipitation for 2011 2015 from the water resources bulletin of liaoning province china we also used the mean value of available annual evapotranspiration for 2011 2015 obtained from the modis satellite data product of myd16a2 available at https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis modis products table myd16a2 v006 for the area within tieling county the tn and tp concentrations computed were 11 6 and 4 25 mg l while for the area within kaiyuan city the computed tn and tp concentrations were 15 0 and 6 16 mg l clearly the computed tn and tp concentrations are not equivalent to the concentrations of nutrients in the water body however to evaluate the npsp risk more intuitively we compared these computed concentrations with the upper limits of tp and tn for drinking water protection zones given by the chinese environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 within the tieling county area the tn and tp concentrations were 11 6 and 21 3 times higher than the surface water standard meanwhile within the kaiyuan county area the tn and tp concentrations were 15 0 and 30 8 times higher than the surface water standard we found that tp concentrations exceeded the water quality standard by more than the tn concentrations this indicates that the potential npsp risk related to tp is higher than that for tn consistent with our conclusions drawn based on results of the nutrient budget method model for this protection zone from the results of our assessments we could demonstrate that the risk is higher in the part of protection zone within kaiyuan city than for the area within tieling county however tieling county encompasses the mountain ridge surrounding the reservoir and consequently is closer to the drinking water source area than kaiyuan city which covers the upstream drainage area of the reservoir to evaluate the risk at finer spatial scales than the county level assessment conducted in this study more observational data or numerical modeling of nutrient movement would be necessary however we have shown the nutrient budget model outlined herein is suitable for assessing the npsp risks to drinking water sources that lack observational data because approximations can be made based on information from the literature or expert knowledge clearly the uncertainty related to these approximations can be reduced as new observational data become available 5 conclusions this study proposes a simple rapid and reliable method for estimating potential npsp risks using residuals of the nutrient budget for reservoir type drinking water sources that lack observational data for such estimations this nutrient balance method uses remote sensing data to compute fertilizer input and crop uptake values in the nutrient budget results of our case study showed that the relative error of the remote sensing based crop yield model was less than 10 n and p are all surpluses at the annual scale within the study area these surpluses had the same order of magnitude when estimated using an independent statistical model suggesting that the imbalances computed using the nutrient model were reliable we could show that surplus p within the soil system posed a potential npsp risk to this drinking water source acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

supplies as well as a source to replenish groundwater thus the formation and risk of the dbps in disinfected wastewater effluents should be concerned in this study the occurrence of 44 dbps including 6 trihalomethanes thms 9 haloaceticacids haas 2 haloketones hks 9 halonitromethanes hnms 9 haloacetonitriles hans and 9 nitrosamines nas was investigated in 12 chlorinated wwtp effluents from five cities of east china the contribution of each class of dbps to the total dbps concentration and additive toxicity was calculated the average concentrations of the 6 classes of dbps were ranked as follows haas 47 0 μg l thms 28 0 μg l hans 9 9 μg l hnms 2 9 μg l hks 0 79 μg l nas 0 69 μg l the significant positive correlations were observed between the formation of thms and haas thms and hans

minor contribution to the calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity hans and nas dominated the dbp associated cytotoxicity accounting for 50 and 34 on an additive toxicity basis despite the minor contributions to the mass concentration with 10 and 1 respectively the risk quotients for three taxonomic groups fish daphnid and green algae were calculated to assess the ecological risk of dbps and the results demonstrated that both haas and hans had high ecological risk for green algae in chlorinated wastewater effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts wastewater effluent chlorination cytotoxicity ecological risk assessment 1 introduction china is a country in severe lack of water resources and listed as one of the thirteen most water stressed countries by the united nations with the climate change population growth and development of urbanization and industrialization the availability of global freshwater resources is gradually declining to meet the increasing water demands the reuse of wastewater has become an effective and environmentally friendly approach to solve the problem of water scarcity al obaidi et al 2018 chuang and mitch 2017 du et al 2017 huang et al 2012 wastewater disinfection is a key step during wastewater treatment to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms prior to discharge or reuse the traditional chemical disinfectants include chlorine chlorine dioxide and ozone in addition to chemical disinfectants ultraviolet light has also been applied for wastewater disinfection chlorine disinfection is currently the most widely used method in wastewater treatment plants wwtps naddeo et al 2009 park et al 2016 krasner et al 2006 wastewater mainly consists of greywaters from laundry water tub showers kitchen sinks and bathroom washbasins and blackwaters from urine and feces dai et al 2015 zeng and mitch 2015 thus there are a large number of dissolved organic matter precursors contributing to the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in the wastewater meng et al 2016 needham et al 2017 zeng et al 2016a previous studies have shown that chlorination resulted in the formation of an array of dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloketones hks halonitromethanes hnms haloacetonitriles hans and nitrosamines nas etc chai et al 2018 chu et al 2012 hang et al 2016 hu et al 2018a 2018b li and mitch 2018 liu et al 2016 liu and li 2010 zhang et al 2017 according to a recent study wastewater effluents were dominant contributors to the formation of nas during chlorination zeng et al 2016a the wastewater effluents discharge could be an important source of a wide range of halogenated and non halogenated dbps of health concern furst et al 2018 furthermore the effluents from wwtps containing a range of dbps with carcinogenicity are utilized downstream as a stable and reusable water supply which causes significant concern deng et al 2018 zeng et al 2016a 2016b in china disinfected wastewater is discharged into natural water system or reused for agricultural irrigation and urban construction or even directly or indirectly discharged into the drinking water sources deng et al 2018 dong et al 2017 and there is a lack of systematic research on dbp formation in chlorinated wastewater effluents since previous studies have measured only one single dbp or a typical class of dbps after disinfection dong et al 2017 hu et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 besides previous studies mainly focused on the regulated dbps including thms and haas an et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 while few studies focused on other unregulated nitrogenous dbps n dbps hans hnms nas etc in wastewater effluents in china it has been demonstrated that these n dbps have higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as thms and haas and thus they have attracted public concern watson et al 2012 widger et al 2017 for instance five of the nine nas have been listed in the u s epa contaminant candidate list 3 ccl 3 and u s epa ccl 4 as human carcinogens li et al 2018 widger et al 2017 however none of the dbps are regulated in wwtp effluents in china hence it is of great significance to investigate the dbp formation in wwtp effluents systematically the objectives of this study were to investigate the occurrence and distribution of 44 aliphatic regulated and unregulated dbps in different chlorinated wwtps effluents and to evaluate their ecological risks and the contribution percentage of each dbp class to the total concentration and cytotoxicity of the dbps studied and the emerging aromatic and heterocyclic dbps with high toxic potencies were not investigated in this study owing to some of the standards and lc50 values of the aromatic heterocyclic dbps for cho cells which were used to evaluate the contributions of the cytotoxicity were not available the results were used to clarify the dominant category of dbps contributing to the concentration and toxicity of the chlorinated wwtp effluents the relationships between the formation of dbps and water quality parameters were also evaluated this was a systematic study focused on the formation of a wide range of dbps in wwtp effluents in china which can provide a significant reference for dbp control in chlorinated wastewater effluents in the future 2 experiments 2 1 reagents and materials details of the chemical standards and reagents used in this study are described in the supporting information si section 1 2 2 sample collection the non chlorinated samples a 1 l 1 were collected from the secondary effluents in twelve wwtps wwtps id a l before chlorine addition in five different cities of east china in april 2018 the samples were collected in 7 l brown glass bottles 6 l for analysis of nas and 1 l for other 35 dbps for each of the 12 wwtps all the samples were transported to the laboratory within 6 h and filtered through 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm membrane filters respectively the filtered samples were stored at 4 c before extraction within 48 h 2 3 chlorination and characterization of the wastewater effluents the non chlorinated samples were chlorinated in headspace free amber glass bottles in the laboratory with the chlorination parameters consistent with those in the wastewater treatment plants 4 mg l 1 naclo 30 min as the chlorinated samples a 2 l 2 then the chlorinated samples were dechlorinated by adding 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of sodium sulfite for each liter of water according to the chlorine residual measured in each aliquot the samples were stored at 4 c and extracted within 24 h the water quality analysis was conducted including the total organic carbon toc ph uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total organic nitrogen ton nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n and the details of the instruments are described in si section 2 2 4 analysis of 44 dbps six categories of dbps 44 compounds including 9 nas and 35 halogenated dbps were quantitatively analyzed nine nas including nitrosodimethylamine ndma nitrosomethylethylamine nmea nitrosodiethylamine ndea nitrosopyrrolidine npyr nitrosomorpholine nmor nitrosodipropylamine ndpa nitrosopiperidine npip nitrosodibutylamine ndba nitrosodiphenylamine ndpha were extracted following a modified version of epa method 521 and analyzed by gc ms twenty six halogenated dbps include six thms trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm tribromomethane tbm dichloroiodine methane dcim triiodomethane tim nine hnms monochloronitromethane mcnm monobromonitromethane mbnm bromochloronitromethane bcnm bromodichloronitromethane bdcnm chlorodibromonitromethane cdbnm dibromonitromethane dbnm dichloronitromethane dcnm tribromonitromethane tbnm trichloronitromethane tcnm nine hans monochloroacetonitrile mcan monobromoacetonitrile mban bromochloroacetonitrile bcan bromodichloroacetonitrile bdcan chlorodibromoacetonitrile cdban dibromoacetonitrile dban dichloroacetonitrile dcan tribromoacetonitrile tban trichloroacetonitrile tcan and the two hks 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone 1 1 1 tcp these dbps were extracted following epa method 551 1 and analyzed by gc ecd nine haas including monochloroacetic acid mcaa monobromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were extracted following epa method 552 3 and analyzed by gc ecd further details of the gc ms and gc ecd analysis are described in si section 3 2 5 dbp associated additive cytotoxicity the contribution of the measured dbps to the overall toxicity of the disinfected wastewater effluents was evaluated by their toxic potencies and the toxicity contribution of one dbp species was obtained by the individual innate toxicity and the measured concentration of the dbp in this study the toxicity weight of every dbp was calculated by dividing measured concentrations by lc50 concentrations in molar units si tables s11 and s12 and assuming the toxicity of individual dbps could be additive this assumption has been used for predicting the toxicity contribution of individual compounds in complex mixtures of trace organic contaminants tang et al 2013 furthermore cytotoxicity has been commonly applied to the evaluation of the overall toxicity of drinking water and recycled wastewater escher et al 2013 jeong et al 2012 leusch and snyder 2015 tang et al 2014 this approach has also been adopted to estimate the contribution of pharmaceuticals to the nonspecific toxicity of wastewater effluents previously reungoat et al 2012 recently the same approach has been employed to estimate the contribution of individual dbps to the dbp associated toxicity within full advanced treatment potable reuse trains zeng et al 2016b ozonation and biological activated carbon treatment of wastewater effluents chuang and mitch 2017 and chlorination of saline groundwater szczuka et al 2017 therefore this approach has been widely employed to estimate the toxicity contributions of individual compounds including dbps since assays fully substantiating the synergistic and antagonistic effects among dbps are not available and toxicological contribution assays are needed the current approach can be adopted for the estimation in this study and to highlight different dbp classes for future toxicological studies the lc50 values of dbps were the concentrations that introduced a 50 reduction in growth of chinese hamster ovary cho cells compared to the control groups and the lc50 values were obtained by the same research group thms haas hnms and hans si tables s11 and s12 for certain dbps such as nas the lc50 values for cho cells were not available thus the toxicity weights of nas were evaluated by the lecr50 values which were calculated based on the age adjusted 10 6 lifetime excess cancer risk values derived from federal register 2014 24582 of u s epa u s epa s iris database and california 27 ccr 25705 si table s12 the toxicity contribution of the two hks 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 dcp bdcan dbcan and tban was not evaluated because both lc50 and lecr50 values were not available and the toxicity weights of bcnm dbcnm dbnm and tbnm were also not evaluated because the retention times for bcnm and dbcnm as well as dbnm and tbnm were too close to be differentiated for accurate quantification in gc analysis therefore the toxicity contribution of 35 dbps was evaluated and compared in this study 2 6 ecological risk assessment since the disinfected effluents are discharged into the natural water the ecological risk assessment of the effluents containing dbps was necessary the method of risk quotient rq for three taxonomic groups fish daphnid green algae at the acute level using lc50 or ec50 values was commonly used to assess the ecological risk of pollutants aydin et al 2018 hela et al 2005 godoy et al 2018 the rqs of the different dbps in this study for a certain taxonomic group were calculated by the following equations 1 and 2 1 rq m e c p n e c 2 pnec l c 50 o r e c 50 s f here mec is the monitoring environmental concentration of one dbp in the effluent pnec is the predicted maximum no effect concentration lc50 and ec50 are obtained from ecosar program developed by the us epa s office of chemical safety and pollution prevention sf is the safety factor of dbps for the acute toxicity and the value of sf is commonly 1000 for wastewater hela et al 2005 2 7 quality assurance and quality control a series of dbps standard solutions were prepared and the solutions were analyzed with gc ecd or gc ms the calibration curves were obtained with good linear relationships r2 0 99 the limits of detection lods precision and recoveries of the analyzed dbps are showed in si tables s1 s3 the lods of 9 nas ranged from 0 6 to 1 5 ng l with the recoveries in the range of 76 101 and the lods of the other 35 dbps ranged from 0 02 to 0 69 μg l with the recoveries in the range of 71 118 the analysis of dbps for each sample was carried out in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of 44 dbps in different effluents six categories of halogenated and non halogenated dbps were measured in the wastewater effluent samples before and after chlorination the concentrations of most of the dbps increased after chlorination which was consistent with previous studies watson et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 most dbps were present in the non chlorinated samples which may be ascribed to the presence of the dbps in the drinking water which serves as the carrier water for sewage krasner et al 2006 zeng et al 2016a the concentrations of the individual dbps in each class of dbps are provided in fig 1 a c for c dbps fig 1d f for n dbps and si tables s5 s10 3 1 1 c dbps thms as shown in figs 1a and si tables s5 and s6 the total concentrations of thms ranged from 2 3 to 60 7 μg l average 28 0 μg l the detection frequency of the total six thms was above 80 and especially 100 for tcm bdcm dcim tim after chlorination the ranking order of the mean mass concentration was tcm 14 6 μg l bdcm 4 8 μg l tbm 3 7 μg l dbcm 3 2 μg l dcim 2 6 μg l tim 0 6 μg l haas as shown in figs 1b and si tables s5 and s7 the total concentrations of haas were in a range of 7 3 120 1 μg l average 47 0 μg l and mcaa dcaa bcaa tcaa and bdcaa were detected in all of the 12 wwtp effluents after chlorination the three species with the highest average concentrations were tcaa 24 7 μg l dcaa 9 9 μg l and bdcaa 8 4 μg l respectively and these three species accounted for 72 among the measured haa9 on the mass concentration basis hks the two hks including 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp were detected with low concentrations in the range of 0 3 1 5 μg l average 0 8 μg l and 0 1 3 5 μg l average 1 5 μg l respectively table 1 although the detected concentrations of the hks were not high both the detection frequency and the detected concentrations significantly increased after chlorination the formation of 1 1 1 tcp was higher than that of 1 1 dcp during chlorination si table s6 3 1 2 n dbps nas as shown in figs 1d and si tables s5 and s8 the total nine nas concentrations were in the range of 350 1190 ng l average 688 ng l during chlorination the ranking order of the mean concentrations followed ndea 311 8 ng l nmea 106 1 ng l ndba 105 0 ng l npyr 103 6 ng l npip 98 5 ng l ndma 95 0 ng l ndpa 67 5 ng l nmor 58 2 ng l ndpha 1 8 ng l surprisingly the species with the highest detected concentration and detection frequency 100 was ndea instead of ndma detection frequency 58 which attracted more attention in drinking water in recent years however the concentrations of ndma in wastewater effluents were much higher than that in groundwater and drinking water as seen from table 1 ndma was the nitrosamine with the highest increasing rate 526 among nine nas after chlorination previous studies showed that there were a large number of precursors for ndma formation in wastewater during chlorination schreiber and mitch 2006 previous studies showed ndea was detected in drinking water and wastewater effluents at different concentrations and more attention was paid to the prevention of ndea formation in drinking water disinfection because of its high cytotoxicity genotoxicity and carcinogenesis zheng et al 2018 hence besides ndma ndea should be specifically concerned in wastewater disinfection because of its high detected concentration and frequency as well as high toxicity hans as shown in figs 1e and si tables s5 and s9 the sum concentrations of the nine hans ranged from 2 9 μg l to 48 6 μg l average 9 9 μg l the three species with the highest mean concentrations were tban 3 2 μg l dban 2 4 μg l and dcan 1 8 μg l total hans concentration in the chlorinated wwtp d d 2 sample was much higher than that in the other chlorinated wwtp effluents which was ascribed to the high concentrations of brominated hans in d 2 the concentrations of two brominated hans dban 22 3 μg l and tban 22 5 μg l in d 2 were not only much higher than the chlorinated hans in this sample but also much higher than the hans in other wwtp samples which implied that some industrial wastewater containing high bromide or brominated chemicals might be discharged into the wwtp d wastewater hnms as shown in figs 1f and si table s10 hnms ranged from 1 0 to 7 4 μg l average 2 9 μg l the two species with the highest mean concentrations were bdcnm 1 0 μg l and dcnm 0 8 μg l the concentrations of tcnm were low in the chlorinated effluent samples because of its easy transformation to tcm under chlorination conditions goslan et al 2017 hong et al 2013 the total concentrations of the individual class of dbps are shown in figs 2a and si table s6 as shown in fig 2 a the total concentrations of the measured dbps increased significantly after chlorination and the sum of the total concentrations of 44 dbps were in the range of 5 5 68 3 μg l average 24 2 μg l before chlorination and 13 5 234 2 μg l average 95 8 μg l after chlorination as shown in fig 2b the percentages of mass concentration for c dbp were haas 46 59 average 54 thms 17 35 average 29 and hks 0 1 5 average 3 but for n dbps hans 6 21 average 10 hnms 2 7 average 3 and nas 0 3 2 average 1 overall haas thms hans hnms hks nas thms and haas accounted for the highest percentages in the range of 66 90 average 82 in the total dbps concentrations thus the two classes of dbps predominated among the measured six classes of dbps on a mass concentration basis which was consistent with previous studies of dbps in groundwater and wastewater effluent li and mitch 2018 zeng et al 2016b 3 2 correlation analysis between dbps formations and wastewater quality in this study the water quality parameters of the chlorinated wastewater effluents including toc tox ton nh3 n no3 n no2 n and uv254 were detected and the results are presented in si table s4 the linear correlations and probability analysis p value were conducted between each class of dbps and the basic water quality parameters by spss 22 0 the p values were employed to evaluate the significant correlation α 0 05 weak significant correlation α 0 1 and non significant correlation as shown in table 2 and si fig s1 the significant positive correlations r2 0 957 0 718 and 0 664 p 0 05 were observed between the formation of thms and the two classes of halogenated dbps haas and hans respectively which was consistent with the previous results krasner et al 2006 there was a significant positive correlations between the formation of haas and hans r2 0 811 p 0 05 in addition a weak significant positive correlations between the formation of thms and hnms r2 0 664 p 0 1 was observed the significant positive correlations between thms and haas as well as thms and hans might imply the same precursors for the formation of these dbps it has been reported that both thms and hans were formed from free amino acids and short oligopeptides during chlorination chu et al 2015 and thus significant positive correlations might occur between thms and hans furthermore the different dbps classes could transform to each other for example tbaa bdcaa and dbcaa can decompose to form tbm bdcm and dbcm respectively via a decarboxylation pathway zhang and minear 2002 and thus significant positive correlations might occur between thms and haas the linear correlations analysis between the wastewater quality parameters and the formation of the measured dbps showed very weak correlations r2 0 005 0 359 similarly bei et al found that there were weak or no linear relationships between water quality parameters and the formation of dbps in drinking water and ground water bei et al 2016 however wang et al showed that the individual water quality parameter might correlate with the formation of dbps in drinking water wang et al 2016 in general it seems that no significant correlations between the wastewater quality parameters and the formation of dbps occurred which might be owing to the minor contribution of the dbps to the total organic matter in surface water and effluents and the results suggested that the wastewater quality parameters could not be used as effective signals to evaluate dbps in wwtp effluents 3 3 calculation of cytotoxicity weight and evaluation of the toxicity contributions in this study the cytotoxicity weighted concentration was evaluated on a basis of the assumption that the toxicity was additive the contribution of one dbp species to dbp associated toxicity depended on its toxicity weighted concentration which was related to its measured concentration and lc50 or lecr50 value the calculated cytotoxicity and percentage toxicity of dbps are presented in fig 2c f this approach has been widely employed to estimate the toxicity contribution of dbps in water samples previously chuang and mitch 2017 escher et al 2013 jeong et al 2012 leusch and snyder 2015 tang et al 2014 zeng et al 2016b the additive cytotoxicity of the five categories of dbps increased significantly in the chlorinated effluents compared to that in the non chlorinated samples fig 2c thms and haas dominated among the measured dbps on a mass concentration basis but only accounted for 3 30 average 12 of the calculated toxicity in the 12 chlorinated wwtp effluents however hans and nas dominated the calculated dbp associated toxicity on an additive toxicity basis despite the minor contributions to the mass concentration they accounted for 60 96 average 84 of the additive toxicity for nine nas figs 2e and 3c ndea dominated the additive toxicity of nas and accounted for 24 95 average 71 while ndma was the second dominant contributor to the additive toxicity and accounted for 0 5 56 average 14 although previous studies were focused on ndma the higher toxicity contribution of ndea in this study indicated that ndea might also need to be specifically concerned for hans figs 2f and 3d dban was the main contributor to the additive toxicity and accounted for 25 95 average 47 followed by bcan mban and dcan which indicated that the brominated hans made higher toxicity contribution than chlorinated hans previous studies showed that most n dbps i e nas hnms and hans presented higher toxicity and health risks than c dbps i e thms and haas for instance the u s epa indicated that the concentrations of aged adjusted 10 6 lifetime excess cancer risk were 0 2 ng l and 0 6 ng l for ndea and ndma respectively in addition zeng and mitch 2015 demonstrated that wastewater effluents were the dominant source of nas and their precursors and wang et al 2016 found that ndma 53 6 ng l and ndea 68 5 ng l were the two major na species in source waters and finished water samples from 30 cities across china thus the emerging na dbps in wastewater effluents should be emphasized in china and recently unregulated halogenated dbps nas and hans in particular have received less attention than thms and haas for their potential contributions to the concentrations of wastewater effluents our assessment suggests that hans and nas with high contributions to the cytotoxicity should be paid more attention in wastewater effluents 3 4 ecological risk assessment the calculated rq values were used to assess the ecological risks of dbps in the wastewater effluents rq 0 1 for low risk 0 1 rq 1 for medium risk and rq 1 for high risk hela et al 2005 godoy et al 2018 the lc50 or ec50 values of dbps were obtained from ecosar program and shown in si table s13 as shown in fig 4 the nine nas two hks and five hnms had low ecological risks for the three taxonomic groups with their rq values less than 0 1 most of the rq values for six thms were lower than 0 1 indicating low ecological risks except for tcm and tbm which had medium risk most of the nine haas had low risks for fish medium risks for daphnid but high risks for green algae especially tcaa and bdcaa in addition most of the nine hans had medium risks for fish and daphnid and high risks for green algae therefore among the six categories of dbps measured in the 12 wwtp effluents haas and hans had higher ecological risks than other four classes of dbps especially for green algae the results of cytotoxicity assessment showed that hans and nas had higher cytotoxicity contribution for cho cells accounting for 50 and 34 of the additive cytotoxicity respectively but haas only accounted for 12 of the additive cytotoxicity the differences between the rank order of cytotoxicity weighted contribution and risk assessment may be ascribed to the different target organisms cho cells were commonly used to assess the cytotoxicity of pollutants and most nas showed high teratogenicity and carcinogenicity krauss et al 2009 lee and oh 2016 but the green algae as a eukaryotic aquatic organism was generally used to assess the ecological risks of pollutants aydin et al 2018 hela et al 2005 godoy et al 2018 this study indicated that the potential ecological risks of dbps should be further concerned and controlled seriously in chlorinated wastewater effluents in the future especially for han and haa in this study only the aliphatic dbps were investigated and evaluated regarding their levels and ecological risks in the wastewater effluents while the aromatic heterocyclic dbps with high toxic potencies which had been found in drinking water and wastewater were not involved gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 most of the aromatic heterocyclic dbps have not been regulated in drinking water and wastewater but their health and ecological risks should not be ignored and may need to be clarified in the future studies 4 conclusion in this study the occurrence and ecological risks of a wide range of 44 dbps in 12 chlorinated wwtps effluents were investigated the concentrations and the total additive toxicity of dbps increased significantly after chlorination among the six categories of dbps haas and thms were the two classes dbps with the highest mass concentrations and accounted for 54 and 29 of the total measured dbps respectively the significant positive correlations were observed between the formation of thms and haas as well as thms and hans hans and nas dominated the calculated dbp associated toxicity accounting for 50 and 34 of the additive toxicity respectively despite their minor contribution to the mass concentrations of the total dbps however haas and hans had higher ecological risks for green algae than the other classes of dbps therefore the dbps in disinfected wwtp effluents should be further concerned and the dbps with high cytotoxicity and ecological risks may need to be regulated in the future conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this

18858,effluents containing disinfection byproducts dbps from wastewater treatment plants wwtps may be discharged to the receiving water bodies or reused for irrigation landscaping and environmental supplies as well as a source to replenish groundwater thus the formation and risk of the dbps in disinfected wastewater effluents should be concerned in this study the occurrence of 44 dbps including 6 trihalomethanes thms 9 haloaceticacids haas 2 haloketones hks 9 halonitromethanes hnms 9 haloacetonitriles hans and 9 nitrosamines nas was investigated in 12 chlorinated wwtp effluents from five cities of east china the contribution of each class of dbps to the total dbps concentration and additive toxicity was calculated the average concentrations of the 6 classes of dbps were ranked as follows haas 47 0 μg l thms 28 0 μg l hans 9 9 μg l hnms 2 9 μg l hks 0 79 μg l nas 0 69 μg l the significant positive correlations were observed between the formation of thms and haas thms and hans as well as haas and hans the results showed that haas and thms were the dominant dbps on a mass concentration basis and accounted for 54 and 29 respectively in the total measured dbps but they made a minor contribution to the calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity hans and nas dominated the dbp associated cytotoxicity accounting for 50 and 34 on an additive toxicity basis despite the minor contributions to the mass concentration with 10 and 1 respectively the risk quotients for three taxonomic groups fish daphnid and green algae were calculated to assess the ecological risk of dbps and the results demonstrated that both haas and hans had high ecological risk for green algae in chlorinated wastewater effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts wastewater

than the regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as thms and haas and thus they have attracted public concern watson et al 2012 widger et al 2017 for instance five of the nine nas have been listed in the u s epa contaminant candidate list 3 ccl 3 and u s epa ccl 4 as human carcinogens li et al 2018 widger et al 2017 however none of the dbps are regulated in wwtp effluents in china hence it is of great significance to investigate the dbp formation in wwtp effluents systematically the objectives of this study were to investigate the occurrence and distribution of 44 aliphatic regulated and unregulated dbps in different chlorinated wwtps effluents and to evaluate their ecological risks and the contribution percentage of each dbp class to the total concentration and cytotoxicity of the dbps studied and the emerging aromatic and heterocyclic dbps with high toxic potencies were not investigated in this study owing to some of the standards and lc50 values of the aromatic heterocyclic dbps for cho cells which were used to evaluate the contributions of the cytotoxicity were not available the results were used to clarify the dominant category of dbps contributing to the concentration and toxicity of the chlorinated wwtp effluents the relationships between the formation of dbps and water quality parameters were also evaluated this was a systematic study focused on the formation of a wide range of dbps in wwtp effluents in china which can provide a significant reference for dbp control in chlorinated wastewater effluents in the future 2 experiments 2 1 reagents and materials details of the chemical standards and reagents used in this study are described in the supporting information si section 1 2 2 sample collection the non chlorinated samples a 1 l 1 were collected from the secondary effluents in twelve wwtps wwtps id a l before chlorine addition in five different cities of east china in april 2018 the samples were collected in 7 l brown glass bottles 6 l for analysis of nas and 1 l for other 35 dbps for each of the 12 wwtps all the samples were transported to the laboratory within 6 h and filtered through 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm membrane filters respectively the filtered samples were stored at 4 c before extraction within 48 h 2 3 chlorination and characterization of the wastewater effluents the non chlorinated samples were chlorinated in headspace free amber glass bottles in the laboratory with the chlorination parameters consistent with those in the wastewater treatment plants 4 mg l 1 naclo 30 min as the chlorinated samples a 2 l 2 then the chlorinated samples were dechlorinated by adding 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of sodium sulfite for each liter of water according to the chlorine residual measured in each aliquot the samples were stored at 4 c and extracted within 24 h the water quality analysis was conducted including the total organic carbon toc ph uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total organic nitrogen ton nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n and the details of the instruments are described in si section 2 2 4 analysis of 44 dbps six categories of dbps 44 compounds including 9 nas and 35 halogenated dbps were quantitatively analyzed nine nas including nitrosodimethylamine ndma nitrosomethylethylamine nmea nitrosodiethylamine ndea nitrosopyrrolidine npyr nitrosomorpholine nmor nitrosodipropylamine ndpa nitrosopiperidine npip nitrosodibutylamine ndba nitrosodiphenylamine ndpha were extracted following a modified version of epa method 521 and analyzed by gc ms twenty six halogenated dbps include six thms trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm tribromomethane tbm dichloroiodine methane dcim triiodomethane tim nine hnms monochloronitromethane mcnm monobromonitromethane mbnm bromochloronitromethane bcnm bromodichloronitromethane bdcnm chlorodibromonitromethane cdbnm dibromonitromethane dbnm dichloronitromethane dcnm tribromonitromethane tbnm trichloronitromethane tcnm nine hans monochloroacetonitrile mcan monobromoacetonitrile mban bromochloroacetonitrile bcan bromodichloroacetonitrile bdcan chlorodibromoacetonitrile cdban dibromoacetonitrile dban dichloroacetonitrile dcan tribromoacetonitrile tban trichloroacetonitrile tcan and the two hks 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone 1 1 1 tcp these dbps were extracted following epa method 551 1 and analyzed by gc ecd nine haas including monochloroacetic acid mcaa monobromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were extracted following epa method 552 3 and analyzed by gc ecd further details of the gc ms and gc ecd analysis are described in si section 3 2 5 dbp associated additive cytotoxicity the contribution of the measured dbps to the overall toxicity of the disinfected wastewater effluents was evaluated by their toxic potencies and the toxicity contribution of one dbp species was obtained by the individual innate toxicity and the measured concentration of the dbp in this study the toxicity weight of every dbp was calculated by dividing measured concentrations by lc50 concentrations in molar units si tables s11 and s12 and assuming the toxicity of individual dbps could be additive this assumption has been used for predicting the toxicity contribution of individual compounds in complex mixtures of trace organic contaminants tang et al 2013 furthermore cytotoxicity has been commonly applied to the evaluation of the overall toxicity of drinking water and recycled wastewater escher et al 2013 jeong et al 2012 leusch and snyder 2015 tang et al 2014 this approach has also been adopted to estimate the contribution of pharmaceuticals to the nonspecific toxicity of wastewater effluents previously reungoat et al 2012 recently the same approach has been employed to estimate the contribution of individual dbps to the dbp associated toxicity within full advanced treatment potable reuse trains zeng et al 2016b ozonation and biological activated carbon treatment of wastewater effluents chuang and mitch 2017 and chlorination of saline groundwater szczuka et al 2017 therefore this approach has been widely employed to estimate the toxicity contributions of individual compounds including dbps since assays fully substantiating the synergistic and antagonistic effects among dbps are not available and toxicological contribution assays are needed the current approach can be adopted for the estimation in this study and to highlight different dbp classes for future toxicological studies the lc50 values of dbps were the concentrations that introduced a 50 reduction in growth of chinese hamster ovary cho cells compared to the control groups and the lc50 values were obtained by the same research group thms haas hnms and hans si tables s11 and s12 for certain dbps such as nas the lc50 values for cho cells were not available thus the toxicity weights of nas were evaluated by the lecr50 values which were calculated based on the age adjusted 10 6 lifetime excess cancer risk values derived from federal register 2014 24582 of u s epa u s epa s iris database and california 27 ccr 25705 si table s12 the toxicity contribution of the two hks 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 dcp bdcan dbcan and tban was not evaluated because both lc50 and lecr50 values were not available and the toxicity weights of bcnm dbcnm dbnm and tbnm were also not evaluated because the retention times for bcnm and dbcnm as well as dbnm and tbnm were too close to be differentiated for accurate quantification in gc analysis therefore the toxicity contribution of 35 dbps was evaluated and compared in this study 2 6 ecological risk assessment since the disinfected effluents are discharged into the natural water the ecological risk assessment of the effluents containing dbps was necessary the method of risk quotient rq for three taxonomic groups fish daphnid green algae at the acute level using lc50 or ec50 values was commonly used to assess the ecological risk of pollutants aydin et al 2018 hela et al 2005 godoy et al 2018 the rqs of the different dbps in this study for a certain taxonomic group were calculated by the following equations 1 and 2 1 rq m e c p n e c 2 pnec l c 50 o r e c 50 s f here mec is the monitoring environmental concentration of one dbp in the effluent pnec is the predicted maximum no effect concentration lc50 and ec50 are obtained from ecosar program developed by the us epa s office of chemical safety and pollution prevention sf is the safety factor of dbps for the acute toxicity and the value of sf is commonly 1000 for wastewater hela et al 2005 2 7 quality assurance and quality control a series of dbps standard solutions were prepared and the solutions were analyzed with gc ecd or gc ms the calibration curves were obtained with good linear relationships r2 0 99 the limits of detection lods precision and recoveries of the analyzed dbps are showed in si tables s1 s3 the lods of 9 nas ranged from 0 6 to 1 5 ng l with the recoveries in the range of 76 101 and the lods of the other 35 dbps ranged from 0 02 to 0 69 μg l with the recoveries in the range of 71 118 the analysis of dbps for each sample was carried out in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of 44 dbps in different effluents six categories of halogenated and non halogenated dbps were measured in the wastewater effluent samples before and after chlorination the concentrations of most of the dbps increased after chlorination which was consistent with previous studies watson et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 most dbps were present in the non chlorinated samples which may be ascribed to the presence of the dbps in the drinking water which serves as the carrier water for sewage krasner et al 2006 zeng et al 2016a the concentrations of the individual dbps in each class of dbps are provided in fig 1 a c for c dbps fig 1d f for n dbps and si tables s5 s10 3 1 1 c dbps thms as shown in figs 1a and si tables s5 and s6 the total concentrations of thms ranged from 2 3 to 60 7 μg l average 28 0 μg l the detection frequency of the total six thms was above 80 and especially 100 for tcm bdcm dcim tim after chlorination the ranking order of the mean mass concentration was tcm 14 6 μg l bdcm 4 8 μg l tbm 3 7 μg l dbcm 3 2 μg l dcim 2 6 μg l tim 0 6 μg l haas as shown in figs 1b and si tables s5 and s7 the total concentrations of haas were in a range of 7 3 120 1 μg l average 47 0 μg l and mcaa dcaa bcaa tcaa and bdcaa were detected in all of the 12 wwtp effluents after chlorination the three species with the highest average concentrations were tcaa 24 7 μg l dcaa 9 9 μg l and bdcaa 8 4 μg l respectively and these three species accounted for 72 among the measured haa9 on the mass concentration basis hks the two hks including 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp were detected with low concentrations in the range of 0 3 1 5 μg l average 0 8 μg l and 0 1 3 5 μg l average 1 5 μg l respectively table 1 although the detected concentrations of the hks were not high both the detection frequency and the detected concentrations significantly increased after chlorination the formation of 1 1 1 tcp was higher than that of 1 1 dcp during chlorination si table s6 3 1 2 n dbps nas as shown in figs 1d and si tables s5 and s8 the total nine nas concentrations were in the range of 350 1190 ng l average 688 ng l during chlorination the ranking order of the mean concentrations followed ndea 311 8 ng l nmea 106 1 ng l ndba 105 0 ng l npyr 103 6 ng l npip 98 5 ng l ndma 95 0 ng l ndpa 67 5 ng l nmor 58 2 ng l ndpha 1 8 ng l surprisingly the species with the highest detected concentration and detection frequency 100 was ndea instead of ndma detection frequency 58 which attracted more attention in drinking water in recent years however the concentrations of ndma in wastewater effluents were much higher than that in groundwater and drinking water as seen from table 1 ndma was the nitrosamine with the highest increasing rate 526 among nine nas after chlorination previous studies showed that there were a large number of precursors for ndma formation in wastewater during chlorination schreiber and mitch 2006 previous studies showed ndea was detected in drinking water and wastewater effluents at different concentrations and more attention was paid to the prevention of ndea formation in drinking water disinfection because of its high cytotoxicity genotoxicity and carcinogenesis zheng et al 2018 hence besides ndma ndea should be specifically concerned in wastewater disinfection because of its high detected concentration and frequency as well as high toxicity hans as shown in figs 1e and si tables s5 and s9 the sum concentrations of the nine hans ranged from 2 9 μg l to 48 6 μg l average 9 9 μg l the three species with the highest mean concentrations were tban 3 2 μg l dban 2 4 μg l and dcan 1 8 μg l total hans concentration in the chlorinated wwtp d d 2 sample was much higher than that in the other chlorinated wwtp effluents which was ascribed to the high concentrations of brominated hans in d 2 the concentrations of two brominated hans dban 22 3 μg l and tban 22 5 μg l in d 2 were not only much higher than the chlorinated hans in this sample but also much higher than the hans in other wwtp samples which implied that some industrial wastewater containing high bromide or brominated chemicals might be discharged into the wwtp d wastewater hnms as shown in figs 1f and si table s10 hnms ranged from 1 0 to 7 4 μg l average 2 9 μg l the two species with the highest mean concentrations were bdcnm 1 0 μg l and dcnm 0 8 μg l the concentrations of tcnm were low in the chlorinated effluent samples because of its easy transformation to tcm under chlorination conditions goslan et al 2017 hong et al 2013 the total concentrations of the individual class of dbps are shown in figs 2a and si table s6 as shown in fig 2 a the total concentrations of the measured dbps increased significantly after chlorination and the sum of the total concentrations of 44 dbps were in the range of 5 5 68 3 μg l average 24 2 μg l before chlorination and 13 5 234 2 μg l average 95 8 μg l after chlorination as shown in fig 2b the percentages of mass concentration for c dbp were haas 46 59 average 54 thms 17 35 average 29 and hks 0 1 5 average 3 but for n dbps hans 6 21 average 10 hnms 2 7 average 3 and nas 0 3 2 average 1 overall haas thms hans hnms hks nas thms and haas accounted for the highest percentages in the range of 66 90 average 82 in the total dbps concentrations thus the two classes of dbps predominated among the measured six classes of dbps on a mass concentration basis which was consistent with previous studies of dbps in groundwater and wastewater effluent li and mitch 2018 zeng et al 2016b 3 2 correlation analysis between dbps formations and wastewater quality in this study the water quality parameters of the chlorinated wastewater effluents including toc tox ton nh3 n no3 n no2 n and uv254 were detected and the results are presented in si table s4 the linear correlations and probability analysis p value were conducted between each class of dbps and the basic water quality parameters by spss 22 0 the p values were employed to evaluate the significant correlation α 0 05 weak significant correlation α 0 1 and non significant correlation as shown in table 2 and si fig s1 the significant positive correlations r2 0 957 0 718 and 0 664 p 0 05 were observed between the formation of thms and the two classes of halogenated dbps haas and hans respectively which was consistent with the previous results krasner et al 2006 there was a significant positive correlations between the formation of haas and hans r2 0 811 p 0 05 in addition a weak significant positive correlations between the formation of thms and hnms r2 0 664 p 0 1 was observed the significant positive correlations between thms and haas as well as thms and hans might imply the same precursors for the formation of these dbps it has been reported that both thms and hans were formed from free amino acids and short oligopeptides during chlorination chu et al 2015 and thus significant positive correlations might occur between thms and hans furthermore the different dbps classes could transform to each other for example tbaa bdcaa and dbcaa can decompose to form tbm bdcm and dbcm respectively via a decarboxylation pathway zhang and minear 2002 and thus significant positive correlations might occur between thms and haas the linear correlations analysis between the wastewater quality parameters and the formation of the measured dbps showed very weak correlations r2 0 005 0 359 similarly bei et al found that there were weak or no linear relationships between water quality parameters and the formation of dbps in drinking water and ground water bei et al 2016 however wang et al showed that the individual water quality parameter might correlate with the formation of dbps in drinking water wang et al 2016 in general it seems that no significant correlations between the wastewater quality parameters and the formation of dbps occurred which might be owing to the minor contribution of the dbps to the total organic matter in surface water and effluents and the results suggested that the wastewater quality parameters could not be used as effective signals to evaluate dbps in wwtp effluents 3 3 calculation of cytotoxicity weight and evaluation of the toxicity contributions in this study the cytotoxicity weighted concentration was evaluated on a basis of the assumption that the toxicity was additive the contribution of one dbp species to dbp associated toxicity depended on its toxicity weighted concentration which was related to its measured concentration and lc50 or lecr50 value the calculated cytotoxicity and percentage toxicity of dbps are presented in fig 2c f this approach has been widely employed to estimate the toxicity contribution of dbps in water samples previously chuang and mitch 2017 escher et al 2013 jeong et al 2012 leusch and snyder 2015 tang et al 2014 zeng et al 2016b the additive cytotoxicity of the five categories of dbps increased significantly in the chlorinated effluents compared to that in the non chlorinated samples fig 2c thms and haas dominated among the measured dbps on a mass concentration basis but only accounted for 3 30 average 12 of the calculated toxicity in the 12 chlorinated wwtp effluents however hans and nas dominated the calculated dbp associated toxicity on an additive toxicity basis despite the minor contributions to the mass concentration they accounted for 60 96 average 84 of the additive toxicity for nine nas figs 2e and 3c ndea dominated the additive toxicity of nas and accounted for 24 95 average 71 while ndma was the second dominant contributor to the additive toxicity and accounted for 0 5 56 average 14 although previous studies were focused on ndma the higher toxicity contribution of ndea in this study indicated that ndea might also need to be specifically concerned for hans figs 2f and 3d dban was the main contributor to the additive toxicity and accounted for 25 95 average 47 followed by bcan mban and dcan which indicated that the brominated hans made higher toxicity contribution than chlorinated hans previous studies showed that most n dbps i e nas hnms and hans presented higher toxicity and health risks than c dbps i e thms and haas for instance the u s epa indicated that the concentrations of aged adjusted 10 6 lifetime excess cancer risk were 0 2 ng l and 0 6 ng l for ndea and ndma respectively in addition zeng and mitch 2015 demonstrated that wastewater effluents were the dominant source of nas and their precursors and wang et al 2016 found that ndma 53 6 ng l and ndea 68 5 ng l were the two major na species in source waters and finished water samples from 30 cities across china thus the emerging na dbps in wastewater effluents should be emphasized in china and recently unregulated halogenated dbps nas and hans in particular have received less attention than thms and haas for their potential contributions to the concentrations of wastewater effluents our assessment suggests that hans and nas with high contributions to the cytotoxicity should be paid more attention in wastewater effluents 3 4 ecological risk assessment the calculated rq values were used to assess the ecological risks of dbps in the wastewater effluents rq 0 1 for low risk 0 1 rq 1 for medium risk and rq 1 for high risk hela et al 2005 godoy et al 2018 the lc50 or ec50 values of dbps were obtained from ecosar program and shown in si table s13 as shown in fig 4 the nine nas two hks and five hnms had low ecological risks for the three taxonomic groups with their rq values less than 0 1 most of the rq values for six thms were lower than 0 1 indicating low ecological risks except for tcm and tbm which had medium risk most of the nine haas had low risks for fish medium risks for daphnid but high risks for green algae especially tcaa and bdcaa in addition most of the nine hans had medium risks for fish and daphnid and high risks for green algae therefore among the six categories of dbps measured in the 12 wwtp effluents haas and hans had higher ecological risks than other four classes of dbps especially for green algae the results of cytotoxicity assessment showed that hans and nas had higher cytotoxicity contribution for cho cells accounting for 50 and 34 of the additive cytotoxicity respectively but haas only accounted for 12 of the additive cytotoxicity the differences between the rank order of cytotoxicity weighted contribution and risk assessment may be ascribed to the different target organisms cho cells were commonly used to assess the cytotoxicity of pollutants and most nas showed high teratogenicity and carcinogenicity krauss et al 2009 lee and oh 2016 but the green algae as a eukaryotic aquatic organism was generally used to assess the ecological risks of pollutants aydin et al 2018 hela et al 2005 godoy et al 2018 this study indicated that the potential ecological risks of dbps should be further concerned and controlled seriously in chlorinated wastewater effluents in the future especially for han and haa in this study only the aliphatic dbps were investigated and evaluated regarding their levels and ecological risks in the wastewater effluents while the aromatic heterocyclic dbps with high toxic potencies which had been found in drinking water and wastewater were not involved gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 most of the aromatic heterocyclic dbps have not been regulated in drinking water and wastewater but their health and ecological risks should not be ignored and may need to be clarified in the future studies 4 conclusion in this study the occurrence and ecological risks of a wide range of 44 dbps in 12 chlorinated wwtps effluents were investigated the concentrations and the total additive toxicity of dbps increased significantly after chlorination among the six categories of dbps haas and thms were the two classes dbps with the highest mass concentrations and accounted for 54 and 29 of the total measured dbps respectively the significant positive correlations were observed between the formation of thms and haas as well as thms and hans hans and nas dominated the calculated dbp associated toxicity accounting for 50 and 34 of the additive toxicity respectively despite their minor contribution to the mass concentrations of the total dbps however haas and hans had higher ecological risks for green algae than the other classes of dbps therefore the dbps in disinfected wwtp effluents should be further concerned and the dbps with high cytotoxicity and ecological risks may need to be regulated in the future conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this

18859,high frequency sensor measurements enable calculation of continuous autotrophic nitrate uptake rate based on its intrinsic relationship with gross primary production gpp the spatiotemporally available data offer prospects to advance process understandings across scales we used continuous 15 min data 2011 2015 from a forest upstream reach and an agricultural downstream reach of the selke river germany based on the high frequency data we developed a parsimonious approach for regionalizing the autotrophic uptake rate considering effects of global radiation and riparian shading for networked modeling we integrated this approach into the fully distributed mesoscale hydrological nitrate model mhm nitrate daily gpp based uptake rate calculations showed distinct seasonal patterns and ranges in the agricultural and forest streams mean values were 80 9 and 15 5 m g n m 2 d 1 respectively validation in the two streams showed acceptable performance r2 0 47 and 0 45 respectively and spatial transferability of the regionalization approach given its parsimony networked modeling results showed high spatiotemporal variability in nitrate transport and uptake throughout the river network the magnitude of gross uptake increased whereas uptake efficiency decreased significantly along stream order longitudinal analysis in the main stem of the selke river revealed that riparian shading and inter annual hydrochemical variations strongly influenced daily dynamics of the uptake efficiency this study provides a parsimonious and transferable procedure for regionalizing in stream

morphological and biogeochemical characteristics influence in stream nutrient processing greatly resulting in high spatiotemporal variability throughout the river network bernhardt et al 2005 the in stream processing is also influenced by factors resulting from terrestrial processes such as nutrient availability and hydrological conditions mulholland et al 2008 with such a high level of complexity investigating nutrient dynamics at the river network scale remains challenging helton et al 2011 following the nutrient spiraling concept i e the cycling of nutrient being assimilated temporarily retained and mineralized ensign and doyle 2006 reach scale studies have provided much information on influential factors and in stream uptake quantifications mulholland et al 2008 due to

quantification of distal factors helton et al 2011 e g riparian vegetation and land cover conditions that influence stream light availability and 3 insufficient coverage of spatiotemporal variations in in stream processes and terrestrial allochthonous inputs nitrate n o 3 has been intensively investigated due to its mobility and environmental impacts grant et al 2018 the in stream fate of n o 3 is strongly correlated with ecosystem metabolism in lotic systems due to biotic demand in benthic biofilms and hyporheic zones bernhardt et al 2018 gomez velez et al 2015 rode et al 2016a measurements in small headwaters demonstrate a strong relationship between total n o 3 uptake and ecosystem metabolism rates and a significant linear regression between n o 3 diel amplitude due to autotrophic uptake and gross primary production gpp roberts and mulholland 2007 however traditional sampling campaigns are mostly conducted in streams where and when stream conditions are optimum bernhardt et al 2018 consequently they are not sufficient for estimating temporal dynamics heffernan and cohen 2010 nor for transferal to different stream conditions the development of sensor techniques allows continuous monitoring under a much wider range of stream conditions and therefore improves understanding of ecosystem processes rode et al 2016b among others n o 3 sensors are widely available and the autotrophic n o 3 uptake rate u a n o 3 m g n m 2 d 1 can be measured directly from high frequency n o 3 concentration measurements i e the diel amplitude based on high frequency monitoring heffernan and cohen 2010 found a strong correlation between measured u a n o 3 and calculations based on measured gpp and the stoichiometric ratio in a subtropical spring fed river in the usa rode et al 2016a related measured u a n o 3 to gpp based on high frequency data in forest and agricultural streams in germany and demonstrated the agreement between regression and stoichiometric methods therefore high frequency monitoring facilitates reliable in stream measurements which can stimulate new insights into n o 3 uptake processing across stream conditions given abundant n o 3 availability stream metabolism is usually controlled by physical factors such as light temperature and flow disturbance o connor et al 2012 uehlinger 2006 among proximal factors light i e photosynthetically active radiation par dominates the variation in gpp mulholland et al 2001 roberts et al 2007 meanwhile distal factors e g land cover and riparian vegetation largely impact the stream surface light availability bernot et al 2010 however the surface light regime and its impact on gpp have not been quantified adequately most likely due to the difficulty in relating the light regimes to widely available data bernhardt et al 2018 based on continuous high frequency sensor deployment rode et al 2016a explicitly showed different seasonal patterns of gpp in closed and open canopy streams interestingly the patterns are highly consistent with those of par measured above forested stream surface and above forest canopy respectively measurements in roberts et al 2007 therefore information derived from continuous high frequency monitoring can be used for relating in stream autotrophic n o 3 uptake to its driving factors especially under diverse light regimes one main challenge in modeling networked n o 3 uptake especially uptake efficiency i e the percentage of the uptake amount to the load is covering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of terrestrial exports e g n o 3 load most network models emphasize in stream processes and simplify greatly representations of terrestrial processes they either statistically relate terrestrial exports to catchment characteristics e g the sparrow model wollheim et al 2008 or define one or more flow components as end members those simplifications restrict the ability to model river networks that have heterogeneous conditions and in which allochthonous terrestrial inputs are likely more diverse dupas et al 2017 alternatively mechanistic catchment water quality models describe catchment characteristics thoroughly rode et al 2010 among them grid based models are preferable due to their inherent higher degree of spatial representation yang et al 2018 moreover the grid based routing structure provides detailed reach scale information e g stream geomorphological features for analyzing in stream processes to our knowledge mechanistic catchment models that provide detailed terrestrial exports have rarely been used to upscale reach scale advances to the network scale in this study we propose a parsimonious regionalization approach for u a n o 3 based on continuous high frequency n o 3 concentration and stream metabolic data 2011 2015 in a forest and an agricultural stream reach of the selke river germany we upscale the findings to the river network scale based on the fully distributed catchment n o 3 model mhm nitrate yang et al 2018 influential factors of global radiation gr and riparian shading are chosen to quantify the stream surface light availability the new data and the modeling approach allow us to 1 obtain continuous daily u a n o 3 data from the high frequency measurements and the intrinsic relationship between u a n o 3 and gpp 2 validate the performance of the u a n o 3 regionalization approach and test the spatial transferability for deviating stream riparian conditions and 3 upscale the approach to the whole selke river network based on the mhm nitrate model and provide detailed spatiotemporal information on n o 3 transport and uptake at the river network scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and high frequency data collection the selke river central germany has a

respectively fig 1 due to gradients of meteorological and geomorphological conditions the catchment is characterized by high hydrological heterogeneity table s1 due to highly fertile soils the agricultural land is dominated by arable land cropped mainly with winter wheat winter barley and maize pasture accounts only for 3 5 of total catchment area and is exclusively located in the upper part of the catchment agricultural streams are mostly characterized by open canopy this is confirmed by a detailed survey from the state agency for flood protection and water management of saxony anhalt lhw on riparian vegetation using 100 m stream segment at the two largest agricultural tributaries of the selke river i e the getel and the hauptseegraben fig s1 only 6 of the surveyed stream segments have gallery trees 80 of them occur only on one side of the stream most of the agricultural streams have no high riparian vegetation only the main stem of the lowland selke river 4th and 5th order is partly shaded by bushes and riparian gallery trees the open canopy allows high irradiance at the water surface and the subsequent development of large mats of periphyton and macrophytes rode et al 2016a the outlet station hausneindorf measures flow and n o 3 dynamics of the entire catchment reaches upstream of this station represent open or very sparse canopy agricultural streams upstream reaches of the station meisdorf are mostly forest streams of which riparian zones are dominated by trees with a closed canopy during the vegetation period in the lowland streams n o 3 concentrations are much higher than those in the upper streams values of biweekly grab samples 1997 2015 at the two stations are 3 61 1 09 and 1 60 1 00 m g l 1 respectively due to long term agricultural activities concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus srp are similarly high 0 040 0 022 m g l 1 at both stations multi parameter sensors ysi 610 and trios props uv were deployed at the two stations we continuously measured dissolved oxygen do water temperature ph turbidity only available in 2015 and n o 3 concentration at a 15 min interval the quality of high frequency sensor n o 3 measurements was validated using parallel grab samples see rode et al 2016a we collected five years of data from january 1 2011 to december 31 2015 from the two stations high frequency discharge and air pressure data were collected from the state agency lhw and the german weather service respectively for more details on the high frequency monitoring and maintenance refer to rode et al 2016a 2 2 calculation of metabolism rates and n o 3 uptake rate daily gpp g o 2 m 2 d 1 and ecosystem respiration er g o 2 m 2 d 1 from 15 min do measurements were calculated based on the single station method odum 1956 the determination of the reaeration coefficient is one of the key issues in metabolic calculation raymond et al 2012 the energy dissipation method bott et al 2006 tsivoglou and neal 1976 was used in this study which has been evaluated with a propan tracer test in the study site rode et al 2016a do saturation percentage was determined from the measured do concentration water temperature and barometric pressure rates of gpp and er were calculated using the measured do differences between consecutive 15 min records considering the effects of do saturation deficit and reaeration day time er was assumed to be equal to the night time er daily net ecosystem production nep was calculated as daily g p p e r for more details on the calculation please refer to the supplementary materials values during over bank flow periods discharge 7 m 3 s 1 were not considered and unrealistic negative gpp and er values were omitted 11 and 14 for meisdorf and hausneindorf respectively for detailed quality control of metabolism rate calculation refer to rode et al 2016a theoretically u a n o 3 m g n m 2 d 1 can be obtained directly from the diel amplitude of n o 3 concentration i e measured u a n o 3 modified from heffernan and cohen 2010 1 u a n o 3 1 a t 0 n q t n o 3 max 0 n o 3 t where n o 3 max 0 and n o 3 t m g l 1 denote the preceding predawn peak of n o 3 concentration and n o 3 concentration at time step t respectively q t l s 1 denotes discharge at time step t a denotes benthic area m 2 which is estimated from the reaeration coefficient and flow velocity measured upstream of each gauging station rode et al 2016a and n denotes the number of measurements per diel change as mentioned by hensley and cohen 2016 and rode et al 2016a upstream effects propagate over a longer distance for n o 3 than for do and the diel change of n o 3 can be disturbed rapidly by additional upstream inputs therefore the measured u a n o 3 from diel amplitudes of n o 3 concentration can only be obtained during steady low flow conditions based on the five years of measurements we defined the regression between measured u a n o 3 and gpp to obtain continuous daily u a n o 3 calculations i e gpp based u a n o 3 calculations 2 3 stream surface light availability and the u a n o 3 regionalization approach light availability near the stream surface is increased by par above the canopy and decreased by shading of riparian vegetation we collected daily sunshine duration data from the ummendorf weather station 35 km north of the hausneindorf station and calculated the theoretical daily gr allen et al 1998 from 2011 to 2015 for details on the gr calculation please refer to the supplementary materials since the daily series of gr fluctuated greatly we smoothed the data using a 5 day moving average method and obtained averaged daily global radiation g r t m j m 2 d 1 the time window of 5 days was arbitrarily chosen to balance the trends and fluctuations the impact of gr on light availability was calculated by min max normalization of the smoothed gr data feature scaling 2 f g r t g r t min g r t 1 n max g r t 1 n min g r t 1 n where f g r t 0 1 denotes the gr coefficient at time t max g r t 1 n and min g r t 1 n denote the maximum and minimum g r t values respectively and n denotes the day number of the time series field measurements of gr and par in a nearby weather station wulferstädt station 2013 2015 showed a strong linear relationship between gr and par p a r 0 64 g r r 2 0 98 and agreement between calculated gr at ummendorf and measured gr at wulferstädt r 2 0 96 fig s2 normalization also eliminated the scale effect therefore we used gr directly instead of par we assumed that riparian vegetation is the same as that in the surrounding landscape therefore the condition of the riparian vegetation was represented by land cover type leaf area index lai was chosen to represent spatiotemporal distribution of the riparian canopy the negative impact of riparian shading on light availability was calculated by min max normalization of lai among all land cover types i e the riparian shading coefficient to simplify preparation of lai data we calculated generic daily lai values for each land cover type using the mean monthly values and applied each annual pattern for all five years when year to year lai changes significantly the measured values or remote sensing data are recommended the overall stream surface light availability was calculated as 3 f l t j f g r t 1 i 1 k α j i f l a i t i where f l t j 0 1 denotes the overall coefficient of near surface light availability of stream segment j at time t f l a i t i 0 1 denotes the riparian shading coefficient of land cover type i and α j i denotes the areal proportion of each land cover type i surrounding stream segment j from grid based modeling perspective one stream segment was defined for each modeling grid cell therefore α j i was equivalent to the length proportion of each riparian vegetation type we further assumed that no significant shading for streams surrounded by non forest types e g agricultural streams and set f l a i t i values of these stream segments to zero the light availability coefficient f l t j provides a spatiotemporal estimate of the combined impact of gr and riparian shading therefore u a n o 3 was simply quantified as 4 u a n o 3 t j u a m a x f l t j where u a n o 3 t j denotes u a n o 3 of stream j at time t and u a m a x denotes the general parameter i e the potential uptake rate this parameter can be explained physically as the u a n o 3 value under optimal gr conditions e g on clear sky dates with the longest sunshine duration of the year based on this parsimonious approach u a n o 3 and its spatiotemporal variability can be easily obtained based on commonly available data i e gr lai and land cover information 2 4 the grid based mhm nitrate model and networked upscaling the mhm nitrate model is a fully distributed catchment nitrate model yang et al 2018 the model is developed on the multi scale platform of the mhm model samaniego et al 2010 the mhm nitrate model provides reliable spatial simulations of hydrological and nitrate fluxes as well as spatial details of physical and environmental characteristics of the catchment these characteristics are upscaled from basic geographical data levels to the modeling level using the multi scale parameter regionalization procedure samaniego et al 2010 each stream segment contains a complete set of flow routing and nitrate processing i e assimilatory uptake mineralization and denitrification therefore stream morphological information can be linked directly to simulating n o 3 transport and uptake processes the new approach of u a n o 3 regionalization eqs 2 4 was integrated into the mhm nitrate model since assimilated nitrogen can be remineralized and return to the in stream nitrate pool mineralization was refined to equal a proportion of autotrophic n o 3 uptake while denitrification remained as that of the original mhm nitrate the model was set up in the selke catchment using a 1 km2 cell size for both terrestrial and in stream phases and was calibrated against observations of the two gauging stations daily discharge and n o 3 concentration were simulated and provided for each stream the proportion of each land cover type in the area of each model cell was calculated using the basic land cover map 100 m resolution morphological characteristics were calculated for each stream as follows stream length was calculated as the distance to the adjacent or diagonal cell based on the digital elevation model dem 100 m resolution and summed up to the modeling level 1 km resolution stream width was estimated from simulated discharge based on the empirical equation by rode et al 2016a gr data from the ummendorf station were used for the entire catchment we matched the modeled river network to the real network that generated from the dem and modified according to topographical maps source from the state agency for survey and geoinformation of sachsen anhalt germany we assigned model simulations to corresponding streams in the real network the main stem of the selke river from the modeled network was used for the daily longitudinal analysis fig s1 2 5 approach validation at reach scale and statistical analysis methods the approach was firstly validated using the daily gpp based u a n o 3 calculations from the agricultural stream station hausneindorf potential outliers in the calculations were detected using the interquartile range iqr method and the u a m a x value was assigned as 1 5 iqr of the upper quartile ca 99 65 this parameter value was then applied directly to the forest stream station meisdorf whose daily u a n o 3 calculations were used to validate the performance of the approach and the transferability of the parameter under different riparian conditions to evaluate the spatial pattern and seasonality of modeled autotrophic n o 3 uptake each stream was identified by three attributes stream order riparian vegetation type and mean uptake values of each season we summarized three types of vegetation at the modeling level agriculture streams surrounded by 80 of agricultural land forest streams surrounded by 80 of forest and mixture all other streams analysis of variance anova was conducted using r software r core team 2017 normality of the data was ensured using log transformation and homogeneity of variance was confirmed using the levene s test results not shown significant anova results p 0 01 were examined further using post hoc test tukey s test for pairwise comparisons the beta coefficient lm beta package in r was calculated to identify the most descriptive attributes higher absolute beta value indicates a stronger effect 3 results and discussion 3 1 metabolism rates and gpp based u a n o 3 calculations in the agricultural stream fig 2 gpp mean standard deviation sd 2 10 1 78 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was moderately correlated with gr r 2 0 42 p 0 01 and therefore generally peaked in summer er mean sd 3 28 1 75 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was slightly higher than gpp but within the same order of magnitude it was also correlated with global radiation r 2 0 33 p 0 01 but the correlation was sometimes influenced by flooding events nep was generally close to zero mean 1 10 1 83 g o 2 m 2 d 1 with slightly positive values in spring 0 50 2 03 g o 2 m 2 d 1 and mostly negative values in late autumn 2 38 1 10 g o 2 m 2 d 1 results generally agreed with the first two year calculation by rode et al 2016a however seasonal patterns of metabolism rates in the last three years were more diverse for instance during the months of june october gpp was significantly lower in 2014 2015 than in 2011 2013 mean 1 66 vs 2 74 g o 2 m 2 d 1 respectively anova p 0 01 in 2014 comparable degree of reductions in gpp and er were observed and mean nep 0 97 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was similar to the annual mean value the reductions may be attributed to higher discharge during the dry months mean 1 26 vs 0 62 m 3 s 1 for other years which increases bottom shear stress possibly resulting in moderate removal of benthic communities biofilm aging and algal sloughing may also contribute to the reduction in both gpp and er during moderate flow uehlinger 2006 in 2015 gpp decreased more than er resulting in higher negative nep mean 2 04 vs 1 22 g o 2 m 2 d 1 for other years turbidity is the most likely cause of this stronger decrease in gpp than in er fig s3 increased turbidity reduces the amount of light that penetrates from the surface to the riverbed while the fine sediments being transported stimulate respiration due to their high concentrations of labile organic carbon o connor et al 2012 roberts et al 2007 metabolism rates in the forest stream fig s4 had distinctly different behavior than those in the agricultural stream gpp mean sd 0 54 0 62 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was significantly lower anova p 0 01 and the seasonal pattern differed completely it increased in spring due to the increase in gr and peaked mean 2 85 g o 2 m 2 d 1 at the beginning of may when significant shading from riparian vegetation occurred in the following month gpp decreased dramatically to a low level mean 0 25 g o 2 m 2 d 1 and remained low until late autumn after litterfall gpp increased slightly e g in 2013 2015 but the increase was low due to the already reduced gr in late autumn roberts et al 2007 er mean sd 4 65 5 61 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was generally much higher than gpp indicating strong net heterotrophic behavior in the forest stream n e p 0 throughout the year the seasonal er pattern was more diverse with generally higher values in winter and spring and high variability throughout the year er was correlated with stream flow r 2 0 60 p 0 01 most likely because er can be stimulated by hydrological events which provide more allochthonous labile organic inputs mulholland et al 2001 linear regressions between measured u a n o 3 and gpp at stations hausneindorf and meisdorf n 90 and 67 respectively fig 3 were similar to those of a former study using the first two years of data 2011 2012 rode et al 2016a this demonstrated that the correlation was robust in the selke catchment 3 2 performance of the u a n o 3 regionalization approach the gr coefficient fig s5a showed a clear seasonal pattern with considerable differences among years e g unimodal or multimodal the shading coefficient based on lai fig s5b demonstrated clear differences in shading among forest types deciduous trees provided the highest shading in july august and almost no shading before leaf out and after litterfall conifers provided constant high shading throughout the year and the other forest types in the selke catchment provided intermediate levels of shading based on our assumptions non forest shading was set to zero the overall light coefficient eq 3 for each stream depended on the proportions of each land cover type see an example in fig s5c daily gpp based u a n o 3 calculations for agricultural and forest streams hausneindorf and meisdorf respectively fig 4 were estimated based on continuous daily gpp and correlations between measured u a n o 3 and gpp respectively the potential uptake rate u a m a x was determined as 283 m g n m 2 d 1 based on the dataset from hausneindorf n 1563 fig s6 for the open canopy agricultural stream simulations from the regionalization approach reproduced the seasonal pattern of the calculated u a n o 3 relatively well fig 4a especially in the first two years when discharge in low flow periods was relatively low and stable in 2013 gpp based u a n o 3 calculations were extremely high 300 m g n m 2 d 1 during march june i e the off set and in between periods of two extreme flooding events simulations underestimated by more than 50 the higher discharge mean 2 50 m 3 s 1 and lower temperature ca 4 c lower than the daily mean during these periods might have introduced high uncertainty in metabolism rate calculations riley and dodds 2012 similarly in march 2014 and 2015 measured u a n o 3 mean 66 6 m g n m 2 d 1 n 12 were similar to the simulations mean 76 1 m g n m 2 d 1 n 62 but much lower than the gpp based calculations mean 131 5 m g n m 2 d 1 n 59 this further suggests that uncertainty in calculated metabolism rate may increase with increased discharge we determined the proportion α of each land cover type in a 1 km2 area surrounding meisdorf i e coniferous forest 0 00 deciduous forest 0 52 mixed forest 0 25 and pasture 0 23 the simulated u a n o 3 reproduced the range and seasonal pattern of gpp based calculations remarkably well fig 4b although we observed discrepancies for the agricultural stream and transferred the potential uptake rate directly to the forest stream the approach clearly captured the large differences of calculated u a n o 3 between the two riparian conditions slight overestimates occurred from may june most likely due to aspect shading from the steep valley alongside the stream bernhardt et al 2018 the approach missed several observed spikes which likely correspond to pulses of discharge and turbidity the dramatic decrease in calculated u a n o 3 in 2012 is probably due to the sharp decrease in water temperature rode et al 2016a in addition to the visual consistency in seasonal patterns the simulations correlated reasonably with the gpp based u a n o 3 calculations r 2 0 47 and 0 45 for hausneindorf and meisdorf respectively given the parsimony of the approach and the distinct uptake behaviors at the two sites therefore light can be identified as the main factor influencing the seasonal autotrophic n o 3 uptake in the selke river other influential factors were similar at the two sites the c n ratios of benthic biofilm were similar 8 7 and 8 5 for the agricultural and forest streams respectively kamjunke et al 2015 from june october water temperature was 14 2 4 3 and 12 0 4 2 c respectively which is sufficient in supporting high growth rates of diatoms anderson 2000 we assumed that riparian vegetation is the same as the surrounding landscape this assumption is validated by the lhw survey data in the catchment although the lowland main stem of the selke is dominated by sparse gallery trees gpp values at hausneindorf are comparable with values reported in other agricultural streams e g beaulieu et al 2013 and griffiths et al 2013 and the approach performed well this indicates that the gallery trees do not provide sufficient shading on the stream surface presumably due to the relatively large side to side distance and less shading density of the trees still the assumptions might not completely valid for agricultural or urban streams with a significant buffer of trees planted along the stream corridor however such information is rarely available at river network scale e g resolution mismatching of satellite data and expensive to survey all tributaries and extrapolating the shading effect from on site measurements remains challenging davies colley and rutherford 2005 our regionalization approach focuses on quantifying stream surface light availability other factors are not included in its design water temperature is not explicitly considered because it is not available network wide and spatiotemporal estimates of water temperature can be quite uncertain the impact of water temperature is partly considered by light and is more relevant for er than for gpp demars et al 2011 turbidity decreases the amount of light that penetrates to benthic areas julian et al 2008 which likely resulted in the overestimation of the simulated u a n o 3 in the summer autumn periods of 2014 2015 based on the continuous measurements in 2015 fig s3 we observed a plausible correspondence between the increase in turbidity and the decrease in gpp but the relationship is quantitatively unclear let alone linking turbidity to widely available discharge data for regionalization purposes flow disturbance likely has significant episodic impact on stream metabolism following a threshold behavior o connor et al 2012 uehlinger 2006 the resilience of gpp to flow disturbance is suspected to be relatively quick especially in high par seasons except for highly complicated cases in which successive disturbances occur o connor et al 2012 the impact of flow disturbance is mechanistically controlled by turbulence and sediment interactions o connor et al 2012 which are challenging to determine and require adequate descriptions of hydraulics and sediment properties therefore flow disturbance is excluded from the approach nutrient limitation may constraint the autotrophic uptake in certain cases however the relationship between nutrient supply and gpp increase is also reported as weak bernot et al 2010 most likely due to the already high nutrient levels in anthropogenically impacted streams 3 3 network upscaling and spatiotemporal variability of n o 3 uptake integrating the approach into mhm nitrate model predicted a strong spatial variability of seasonal mean u a n o 3 fig s7 agricultural streams had much higher uptake rates than forest streams mean sd 86 4 1 9 vs 18 8 6 2 m g n m 2 d 1 respectively due to less riparian shading the differences between the two main riparian vegetation types were much smaller in winter 10 1 0 42 vs 4 6 2 2 m g n m 2 d 1 probably due to the universally low winter gr the higher sd for forest streams indicated more diverse uptake patterns due to different shading patterns represented by different lai patterns in different forest types we used only basic information i e global radiation lai and land cover information but did provide the varied seasonality of u a n o 3 under different light regimes by multiplying modeled stream benthic areas seasonal mean gross n o 3 uptake u a s s k g n d 1 was calculated for each stream in the network fig 5 the coefficient of variance cv of u a s s was much higher than that of u a n o 3 cvs of annual mean 1 51 and 0 57 respectively indicating a higher overall spatial variability due to variations in stream morphological properties u a s s varied among areas with the same shading condition two way anova showed that u a s s varied significantly among different stream orders and vegetation types in all seasons a post hoc test tukey s test identified that the u a s s of 1st annual mean 0 27 k g n d 1 and 2nd 0 51 k g n d 1 order streams was significantly lower than that of higher orders 1 77 k g n d 1 for all 3rd 5th order streams due to flow accumulation in higher order streams the u a s s of forest streams differed significantly from those of agricultural and mixed streams except in winter when all values were low u a s s also showed significant seasonal variability in all streams anova p 0 01 however post hoc test revealed that mean values in spring and summer differed significantly only in forest streams the differences in agricultural and mixed streams p 0 50 and 0 93 respectively attenuated due to the larger benthic area in spring albeit generally higher u a n o 3 in summer the beta coefficients indicated that season and stream order had the greatest effect on u a s s whereas season and vegetation type had the greatest effect on u a n o 3 we used the detailed spatial simulations of nitrate loads l n o 3 k g n d 1 from the mhm nitrate model fig s8 to calculate the uptake efficiency i e the uptake percentage u p u a s s l n o 3 100 for each stream in the network u p peaked in summer mean sd 21 4 17 8 when the highest u a s s encountered the lowest l n o 3 table s2 whereas in winter u p values were extremely low throughout the river network 1 0 1 7 due to the high l n o 3 and low u a s s u p was consistently lower in higher order streams e g annual means were ca 14 and 4 in 1st and 4th order streams respectively mainly due to the greater increase in l n o 3 than in u a s s with increasing stream order however all pairs of adjacent stream orders i e 1st 2nd 2nd 3rd and 3rd 4th did not differ significantly p 0 01 in summer this can be attributed to the consistently low l n o 3 from 1st to 4th order streams in summer mean 5 to 55 k g n d 1 respectively longitudinal daily u p in the main stem of the selke clearly showed the strong impact of riparian vegetation on u p seasonal dynamics and its inter annual variation fig 6 critical locations and periods of high n o 3 uptake percentage e g 40 could be explicitly identified the critical period was longer in upper agricultural streams 23 km from the outlet than in lower agricultural streams 11 km from the outlet the shallow impermeable bedrock in the upper selke catchment results in a preference of flashier flow path which prevents n o 3 accumulation in the soil dupas et al 2017 whereas loess sediments dominate the lower agricultural part of the catchment and n o 3 concentration in the soil can reach up to ca 40 m g l 1 due to agricultural activities yang et al 2018 therefore l n o 3 was much lower in the upstream of the selke river than in the downstream especially during baseflow dominant periods this presumably prolonged the periods of high uptake percentage in the upper agricultural streams u p in forest streams ca 12 22 km from the outlet generally increased from winter to spring and peaked in may or june then sharply decreased to a low level mean 3 seasonal dynamics of u p differed among years depending on the spatiotemporal combination of l n o 3 and u a s s the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of l n o 3 had more influence on u p due to its higher order of magnitude compare to those of u a s s in lowland agricultural streams the period of high uptake percentage in 2011 was much more pronounced in streams upstream of the confluence than downstream where the getel stream joins the main selke fig 6 this is due to much lower l n o 3 from the upper selke stream in june october of 2011 mean load 41 6 vs 107 3 k g n d 1 for the five year mean of this dry period and higher relative contribution of l n o 3 from the getel stream 32 vs 15 for the five year mean 3 4 implications an increasing number of water quality parameters such as ph do turbidity n o 3 and srp can be measured at high temporal resolution by sensors the new data thus provide potential insights of in stream processes at reach scale rode et al 2016b however regionalizing those processes remains challenging because in stream processes e g n o 3 assimilation and remineralization always interact intensively and only a few can be individually linked to observations e g the autotrophic n o 3 uptake in this study therefore novel reach scale experimental designs are needed in current future research to provide direct measurements of individual processes e g a new reach scale mass balance approach by kunz et al 2017 can potentially be used to regionalize the in stream denitrification process in the regionalization procedure the selection of key environmental factors is critical at both reach and network scales there is a high risk of over parameterizing approaches based on reach scale understandings we are unable to consider certain influential factors due to data limitations and catchment scale behavior might be simpler than that expected from detailed process understanding jackson blake et al 2017 therefore a parsimonious approach can be an appropriate initial step for upscaling issues kirchner 2006 specifically the parsimony of an approach is reflected in our opinion in two perspectives 1 input data requirements i e the applicability of an approach depends largely on the input data it requires and the accessibility of these data and 2 the parameterization i e the introduced parameter should be easily identifiable and transferable with clear physical meaning the proposed regionalization of u a n o 3 used only gr lai and land cover data which are widely available for entire catchment but quantified spatiotemporal variations in stream surface light regimes well the physical meaning of the parameter u a m a x indicates that it can be measured directly by traditional field experiments and be transferred to regions with similar radiation condition 4 conclusions five year continuous high frequency measurements revealed strong correlations between in stream autotrophic n o 3 uptake and ecosystem metabolism specifically gpp and distinct seasonal behaviors in forest and agricultural streams were observed in this study a parsimonious approach was proposed to quantify stream surface light availability i e using basic gr lai and land cover information and to regionalize u a n o 3 the approach performed well in terms of capturing seasonal variations and improving spatial transferability to different riparian shading conditions the parsimonies of data requirements and parameterization suggest that the approach has a strong upscaling capability by integrating the approach into the fully distributed mhm nitrate model more detailed spatiotemporal variability of n o 3 transport and uptake could be investigated at river network scale which is informative in guiding water quality management this study provides a working procedure for regionalizing in stream process understandings inspired from new high frequency

18859,high frequency sensor measurements enable calculation of continuous autotrophic nitrate uptake rate based on its intrinsic relationship with gross primary production gpp the spatiotemporally available data offer prospects to advance process understandings across scales we used continuous 15 min data 2011 2015 from a forest upstream reach and an agricultural downstream reach of the selke river germany based on the high frequency data we developed a parsimonious approach for regionalizing the autotrophic uptake rate considering effects of global radiation and riparian shading for networked modeling we integrated this approach into the fully distributed mesoscale hydrological nitrate model mhm nitrate daily gpp based uptake rate calculations showed distinct seasonal patterns and ranges in the agricultural and forest streams mean values were 80 9 and 15 5 m g n m 2 d 1 respectively validation in the two streams showed acceptable performance r2 0 47 and 0 45 respectively and spatial transferability of the regionalization approach given its parsimony networked modeling results showed high spatiotemporal variability in nitrate transport and uptake throughout the river network the magnitude of gross uptake increased whereas uptake efficiency decreased significantly along stream order longitudinal analysis in the main stem of the selke river revealed that riparian shading and inter annual hydrochemical variations strongly influenced daily dynamics of the uptake efficiency this study provides a parsimonious and transferable procedure for regionalizing in stream

in in stream processes and terrestrial allochthonous inputs nitrate n o 3 has been intensively investigated due to its mobility and environmental impacts grant et al 2018 the in stream fate of n o 3 is strongly correlated with ecosystem metabolism in lotic systems due to biotic demand in benthic biofilms and hyporheic zones bernhardt et al 2018 gomez velez et al 2015 rode et al 2016a measurements in small headwaters demonstrate a strong relationship between total n o 3 uptake and ecosystem metabolism rates and a significant linear regression between n o 3 diel amplitude due to autotrophic uptake and gross primary production gpp roberts and mulholland 2007 however traditional sampling campaigns are mostly conducted in streams where and when stream conditions are optimum bernhardt et al 2018 consequently they are not sufficient for estimating temporal dynamics heffernan and cohen 2010 nor for transferal to different stream conditions the development of sensor techniques allows continuous monitoring under a much wider range of stream conditions and therefore improves understanding of ecosystem processes rode et al 2016b among others n o 3 sensors are widely available and the autotrophic n o 3 uptake rate u a n o 3 m g n m 2 d 1 can be measured directly from high frequency n o 3 concentration measurements i e the diel amplitude based on high frequency monitoring heffernan and cohen 2010 found a strong correlation between measured u a n o 3 and calculations based on measured gpp and the stoichiometric ratio in a subtropical spring fed river in the usa rode et al 2016a related measured u a n o 3 to gpp based on high frequency data in forest and agricultural streams in germany and demonstrated the agreement between regression and stoichiometric methods therefore high frequency monitoring facilitates reliable in stream measurements which can stimulate new insights into n o 3 uptake processing across stream conditions given abundant n o 3 availability stream metabolism is usually controlled by physical factors such as light temperature and flow disturbance o connor et al 2012 uehlinger 2006 among proximal factors light i e photosynthetically active radiation par dominates the variation in gpp mulholland et al 2001 roberts et al 2007 meanwhile distal factors e g land cover and riparian vegetation largely impact the stream surface light availability bernot et al 2010 however the surface light regime and its impact on gpp have not been quantified adequately most likely due to the difficulty in relating the light regimes to widely available data bernhardt et al 2018 based on continuous high frequency sensor deployment rode et al 2016a explicitly showed different seasonal patterns of gpp in closed and open canopy streams interestingly the patterns are highly consistent with those of par measured above forested stream surface and above forest canopy respectively measurements in roberts et al 2007 therefore information derived from continuous high frequency monitoring can be used for relating in stream autotrophic n o 3 uptake to its driving factors especially under diverse light regimes one main challenge in modeling networked n o 3 uptake especially uptake efficiency i e the percentage of the uptake amount to the load is covering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of terrestrial exports e g n o 3 load most network models emphasize in stream processes and simplify greatly representations of terrestrial processes they either statistically relate terrestrial exports to catchment characteristics e g the sparrow model wollheim et al 2008 or define one or more flow components as end members those simplifications restrict the ability to model river networks that have heterogeneous conditions and in which allochthonous terrestrial inputs are likely more diverse dupas et al 2017 alternatively mechanistic catchment water quality models describe catchment characteristics thoroughly rode et al 2010 among them grid based models are preferable due to their inherent higher degree of spatial representation yang et al 2018 moreover the grid based routing structure provides detailed reach scale information e g stream geomorphological features for analyzing in stream processes to our knowledge mechanistic catchment models that provide detailed terrestrial exports have rarely been used to upscale reach scale advances to the network scale in this study we propose a parsimonious regionalization approach for u a n o 3 based on continuous high frequency n o 3 concentration and stream metabolic data 2011 2015 in a forest and an agricultural stream reach of the selke river germany we upscale the findings to the river network scale based on the fully distributed catchment n o 3 model mhm nitrate yang et al 2018 influential factors of global radiation gr and riparian shading are chosen to quantify the stream surface light availability the new data and the modeling approach allow us to 1 obtain continuous daily u a n o 3 data from the high frequency measurements and the intrinsic relationship between u a n o 3 and gpp 2 validate the performance of the u a n o 3 regionalization approach and test the spatial transferability for deviating stream riparian conditions and 3 upscale the approach to the whole selke river network based on the mhm nitrate model and provide detailed spatiotemporal information on n o 3 transport and uptake at the river network scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and high frequency data collection the selke river central germany has a drainage area of 456 km2 it is part of the tereno terrestrial environmental observatories project http www tereno net overview de last accessed october 31 2018 the elevation ranges from 605 m in the upper mountains to 53 m in the lowlands the two study reaches are located upstream of the gauging stations meisdorf and hausneindorf representing the dominant forested and agricultural land respectively fig 1 due to gradients of meteorological and geomorphological conditions the catchment is characterized by high hydrological heterogeneity table s1 due to highly fertile soils the agricultural land is dominated by arable land cropped mainly with winter wheat winter barley and maize pasture accounts only for 3 5 of total catchment area and is exclusively located in the upper part of the catchment agricultural streams are mostly characterized by open canopy this is confirmed by a detailed survey from the state agency for flood protection and water management of saxony anhalt lhw on riparian vegetation using 100 m stream segment at the two largest agricultural tributaries of the selke river i e the getel and the hauptseegraben fig s1 only 6 of the surveyed stream segments have gallery trees 80 of them occur only on one side of the stream most of the agricultural streams have no high riparian vegetation only the main stem of the lowland selke river 4th and 5th order is partly shaded by bushes and riparian gallery trees the open canopy allows high irradiance at the water surface and the subsequent development of large mats of periphyton and macrophytes rode et al 2016a the outlet station hausneindorf measures flow and n o 3 dynamics of the entire catchment reaches upstream of this station represent open or very sparse canopy agricultural streams upstream reaches of the station meisdorf are mostly forest streams of which riparian zones are dominated by trees with a closed canopy during the vegetation period in the lowland streams n o 3 concentrations are much higher than those in the upper streams values of biweekly grab samples 1997 2015 at the two stations are 3 61 1 09 and 1 60 1 00 m g l 1 respectively due to long term agricultural activities concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus srp are similarly high 0 040 0 022 m g l 1 at both stations multi parameter sensors ysi 610 and trios props uv were deployed at the two stations we continuously measured dissolved oxygen do water temperature ph turbidity only available in 2015 and n o 3 concentration at a 15 min interval the quality of high frequency sensor n o 3 measurements was validated using parallel grab samples see rode et al 2016a we collected five years of data from january 1 2011 to december 31 2015 from the two stations high frequency discharge and air pressure data were collected from the state agency lhw and the german weather service respectively for more details on the high frequency monitoring and maintenance refer to rode et al 2016a 2 2 calculation of metabolism rates and n o 3 uptake rate daily gpp g o 2 m 2 d 1 and ecosystem respiration er g o 2 m 2 d 1 from 15 min do measurements were calculated based on the single station method odum 1956 the determination of the reaeration coefficient is one of the key issues in metabolic calculation raymond et al 2012 the energy dissipation method bott et al 2006 tsivoglou and neal 1976 was used in this study which has been evaluated with a propan tracer test in the study site rode et al 2016a do saturation percentage was determined from the measured do concentration water temperature and barometric pressure rates of gpp and er were calculated using the measured do differences between consecutive 15 min records considering the effects of do saturation deficit and reaeration day time er was assumed to be equal to the night time er daily net ecosystem production nep was calculated as daily g p p e r for more details on the calculation please refer to the supplementary materials values during over bank flow periods discharge 7 m 3 s 1 were not considered and unrealistic negative gpp and er values were omitted 11 and 14 for meisdorf and hausneindorf respectively for detailed quality control of metabolism rate calculation refer to rode et al 2016a theoretically u a n o 3 m g n m 2 d 1 can be obtained directly from the diel amplitude of n o 3 concentration i e measured u a n o 3 modified from heffernan and cohen 2010 1 u a n o 3 1 a t 0 n q t n o 3 max 0 n o 3 t where n o 3 max 0 and n o 3 t m g l 1 denote the preceding predawn peak of n o 3 concentration and n o 3 concentration at time step t respectively q t l s 1 denotes discharge at time step t a denotes benthic area m 2 which is estimated from the reaeration coefficient and flow velocity measured upstream of each gauging station rode et al 2016a and n denotes the number of measurements per diel change as mentioned by hensley and cohen 2016 and rode et al 2016a upstream effects propagate over a longer distance for n o 3 than for do and the diel change of n o 3 can be disturbed rapidly by additional upstream inputs therefore the measured u a n o 3 from diel amplitudes of n o 3 concentration can only be obtained during steady low flow conditions based on the five years of measurements we defined the regression between measured u a n o 3 and gpp to obtain continuous daily u a n o 3 calculations i e gpp based u a n o 3 calculations 2 3 stream surface light availability and the u a n o 3 regionalization approach light availability near the stream surface is increased by par above the canopy and decreased by shading of riparian vegetation we collected daily sunshine duration data from the ummendorf weather station 35 km north of the hausneindorf station and calculated the theoretical daily gr allen et al 1998 from 2011 to 2015 for details on the gr calculation please refer to the supplementary materials since the daily series of gr fluctuated greatly we smoothed the data using a 5 day moving average method and obtained averaged daily global radiation g r t m j m 2 d 1 the time window of 5 days was arbitrarily chosen to balance the trends and fluctuations the impact of gr on light availability was calculated by min max normalization of the smoothed gr data feature scaling 2 f g r t g r t min g r t 1 n max g r t 1 n min g r t 1 n where f g r t 0 1 denotes the gr coefficient at time t max g r t 1 n and min g r t 1 n denote the maximum and minimum g r t values respectively and n denotes the day number of the time series field measurements of gr and par in a nearby weather station wulferstädt station 2013 2015 showed a strong linear relationship between gr and par p a r 0 64 g r r 2 0 98 and agreement between calculated gr at ummendorf and measured gr at wulferstädt r 2 0 96 fig s2 normalization also eliminated the scale effect therefore we used gr directly instead of par we assumed that riparian vegetation is the same as that in the surrounding landscape therefore the condition of the riparian vegetation was represented by land cover type leaf area index lai was chosen to represent spatiotemporal distribution of the riparian canopy the negative impact of riparian shading on light availability was calculated by min max normalization of lai among all land cover types i e the riparian shading coefficient to simplify preparation of lai data we calculated generic daily lai values for each land cover type using the mean monthly values and applied each annual pattern for all five years when year to year lai changes significantly the measured values or remote sensing data are recommended the overall stream surface light availability was calculated as 3 f l t j f g r t 1 i 1 k α j i f l a i t i where f l t j 0 1 denotes the overall coefficient of near surface light availability of stream segment j at time t f l a i t i 0 1 denotes the riparian shading coefficient of land cover type i and α j i denotes the areal proportion of each land cover type i surrounding stream segment j from grid based modeling perspective one stream segment was defined for each modeling grid cell therefore α j i was equivalent to the length proportion of each riparian vegetation type we further assumed that no significant shading for streams surrounded by non forest types e g agricultural streams and set f l a i t i values of these stream segments to zero the light availability coefficient f l t j provides a spatiotemporal estimate of the combined impact of gr and riparian shading therefore u a n o 3 was simply quantified as 4 u a n o 3 t j u a m a x f l t j where u a n o 3 t j denotes u a n o 3 of stream j at time t and u a m a x denotes the general parameter i e the potential uptake rate this parameter can be explained physically as the u a n o 3 value under optimal gr conditions e g on clear sky dates with the longest sunshine duration of the year based on this parsimonious approach u a n o 3 and its spatiotemporal variability can be easily obtained based on commonly available data i e gr lai and land cover information 2 4 the grid based mhm nitrate model and networked upscaling the mhm nitrate model is a fully distributed catchment nitrate model yang et al 2018 the model is developed on the multi scale platform of the mhm model samaniego et al 2010 the mhm nitrate model provides reliable spatial simulations of hydrological and nitrate fluxes as well as spatial details of physical and environmental characteristics of the catchment these characteristics are upscaled from basic geographical data levels to the modeling level using the multi scale parameter regionalization procedure samaniego et al 2010 each stream segment contains a complete set of flow routing and nitrate processing i e assimilatory uptake mineralization and denitrification therefore stream morphological information can be linked directly to simulating n o 3 transport and uptake processes the new approach of u a n o 3 regionalization eqs 2 4 was integrated into the mhm nitrate model since assimilated nitrogen can be remineralized and return to the in stream nitrate pool mineralization was refined to equal a proportion of autotrophic n o 3 uptake while denitrification remained as that of the original mhm nitrate the model was set up in the selke catchment using a 1 km2 cell size for both terrestrial and in stream phases and was calibrated against observations of the two gauging stations daily discharge and n o 3 concentration were simulated and provided for each stream the proportion of each land cover type in the area of each model cell was calculated using the basic land cover map 100 m resolution morphological characteristics were calculated for each stream as follows stream length was calculated as the distance to the adjacent or diagonal cell based on the digital elevation model dem 100 m resolution and summed up to the modeling level 1 km resolution stream width was estimated from simulated discharge based on the empirical equation by rode et al 2016a gr data from the ummendorf station were used for the entire catchment we matched the modeled river network to the real network that generated from the dem and modified according to topographical maps source from the state agency for survey and geoinformation of sachsen anhalt germany we assigned model simulations to corresponding streams in the real network the main stem of the selke river from the modeled network was used for the daily longitudinal analysis fig s1 2 5 approach validation at reach scale and statistical analysis methods the approach was firstly validated using the daily gpp based u a n o 3 calculations from the agricultural stream station hausneindorf potential outliers in the calculations were detected using the interquartile range iqr method and the u a m a x value was assigned as 1 5 iqr of the upper quartile ca 99 65 this parameter value was then applied directly to the forest stream station meisdorf whose daily u a n o 3 calculations were used to validate the performance of the approach and the transferability of the parameter under different riparian conditions to evaluate the spatial pattern and seasonality of modeled autotrophic n o 3 uptake each stream was identified by three attributes stream order riparian vegetation type and mean uptake values of each season we summarized three types of vegetation at the modeling level agriculture streams surrounded by 80 of agricultural land forest streams surrounded by 80 of forest and mixture all other streams analysis of variance anova was conducted using r software r core team 2017 normality of the data was ensured using log transformation and homogeneity of variance was confirmed using the levene s test results not shown significant anova results p 0 01 were examined further using post hoc test tukey s test for pairwise comparisons the beta coefficient lm beta package in r was calculated to identify the most descriptive attributes higher absolute beta value indicates a stronger effect 3 results and discussion 3 1 metabolism rates and gpp based u a n o 3 calculations in the agricultural stream fig 2 gpp mean standard deviation sd 2 10 1 78 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was moderately correlated with gr r 2 0 42 p 0 01 and therefore generally peaked in summer er mean sd 3 28 1 75 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was slightly higher than gpp but within the same order of magnitude it was also correlated with global radiation r 2 0 33 p 0 01 but the correlation was sometimes influenced by flooding events nep was generally close to zero mean 1 10 1 83 g o 2 m 2 d 1 with slightly positive values in spring 0 50 2 03 g o 2 m 2 d 1 and mostly negative values in late autumn 2 38 1 10 g o 2 m 2 d 1 results generally agreed with the first two year calculation by rode et al 2016a however seasonal patterns of metabolism rates in the last three years were more diverse for instance during the months of june october gpp was significantly lower in 2014 2015 than in 2011 2013 mean 1 66 vs 2 74 g o 2 m 2 d 1 respectively anova p 0 01 in 2014 comparable degree of reductions in gpp and er were observed and mean nep 0 97 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was similar to the annual mean value the reductions may be attributed to higher discharge during the dry months mean 1 26 vs 0 62 m 3 s 1 for other years which increases bottom shear stress possibly resulting in moderate removal of benthic communities biofilm aging and algal sloughing may also contribute to the reduction in both gpp and er during moderate flow uehlinger 2006 in 2015 gpp decreased more than er resulting in higher negative nep mean 2 04 vs 1 22 g o 2 m 2 d 1 for other years turbidity is the most likely cause of this stronger decrease in gpp than in er fig s3 increased turbidity reduces the amount of light that penetrates from the surface to the riverbed while the fine sediments being transported stimulate respiration due to their high concentrations of labile organic carbon o connor et al 2012 roberts et al 2007 metabolism rates in the forest stream fig s4 had distinctly different behavior than those in the agricultural stream gpp mean sd 0 54 0 62 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was significantly lower anova p 0 01 and the seasonal pattern differed completely it increased in spring due to the increase in gr and peaked mean 2 85 g o 2 m 2 d 1 at the beginning of may when significant shading from riparian vegetation occurred in the following month gpp decreased dramatically to a low level mean 0 25 g o 2 m 2 d 1 and remained low until late autumn after litterfall gpp increased slightly e g in 2013 2015 but the increase was low due to the already reduced gr in late autumn roberts et al 2007 er mean sd 4 65 5 61 g o 2 m 2 d 1 was generally much higher than gpp indicating strong net heterotrophic behavior in the forest stream n e p 0 throughout the year the seasonal er pattern was more diverse with generally higher values in winter and spring and high variability throughout the year er was correlated with stream flow r 2 0 60 p 0 01 most likely because er can be stimulated by hydrological events which provide more allochthonous labile organic inputs mulholland et al 2001 linear regressions between measured u a n o 3 and gpp at stations hausneindorf and meisdorf n 90 and 67 respectively fig 3 were similar to those of a former study using the first two years of data 2011 2012 rode et al 2016a this demonstrated that the correlation was robust in the selke catchment 3 2 performance of the u a n o 3 regionalization approach the gr coefficient fig s5a showed a clear seasonal pattern with considerable differences among years e g unimodal or multimodal the shading coefficient based on lai fig s5b demonstrated clear differences in shading among forest types deciduous trees provided the highest shading in july august and almost no shading before leaf out and after litterfall conifers provided constant high shading throughout the year and the other forest types in the selke catchment provided intermediate levels of shading based on our assumptions non forest shading was set to zero the overall light coefficient eq 3 for each stream depended on the proportions of each land cover type see an example in fig s5c daily gpp based u a n o 3 calculations for agricultural and forest streams hausneindorf and meisdorf respectively fig 4 were estimated based on continuous daily gpp and correlations between measured u a n o 3 and gpp respectively the potential uptake rate u a m a x was determined as 283 m g n m 2 d 1 based on the dataset from hausneindorf n 1563 fig s6 for the open canopy agricultural stream simulations from the regionalization approach reproduced the seasonal pattern of the calculated u a n o 3 relatively well fig 4a especially in the first two years when discharge in low flow periods was relatively low and stable in 2013 gpp based u a n o 3 calculations were extremely high 300 m g n m 2 d 1 during march june i e the off set and in between periods of two extreme flooding events simulations underestimated by more than 50 the higher discharge mean 2 50 m 3 s 1 and lower temperature ca 4 c lower than the daily mean during these periods might have introduced high uncertainty in metabolism rate calculations riley and dodds 2012 similarly in march 2014 and 2015 measured u a n o 3 mean 66 6 m g n m 2 d 1 n 12 were similar to the simulations mean 76 1 m g n m 2 d 1 n 62 but much lower than the gpp based calculations mean 131 5 m g n m 2 d 1 n 59 this further suggests that uncertainty in calculated metabolism rate may increase with increased discharge we determined the proportion α of each land cover type in a 1 km2 area surrounding meisdorf i e coniferous forest 0 00 deciduous forest 0 52 mixed forest 0 25 and pasture 0 23 the simulated u a n o 3 reproduced the range and seasonal pattern of gpp based calculations remarkably well fig 4b although we observed discrepancies for the agricultural stream and transferred the potential uptake rate directly to the forest stream the approach clearly captured the large differences of calculated u a n o 3 between the two riparian conditions slight overestimates occurred from may june most likely due to aspect shading from the steep valley alongside the stream bernhardt et al 2018 the approach missed several observed spikes which likely correspond to pulses of discharge and turbidity the dramatic decrease in calculated u a n o 3 in 2012 is probably due to the sharp decrease in water temperature rode et al 2016a in addition to the visual consistency in seasonal patterns the simulations correlated reasonably with the gpp based u a n o 3 calculations r 2 0 47 and 0 45 for hausneindorf and meisdorf respectively given the parsimony of the approach and the distinct uptake behaviors at the two sites therefore light can be identified as the main factor influencing the seasonal autotrophic n o 3 uptake in the selke river other influential factors were similar at the two sites the c n ratios of benthic biofilm were similar 8 7 and 8 5 for the agricultural and forest streams respectively kamjunke et al 2015 from june october water temperature was 14 2 4 3 and 12 0 4 2 c respectively which is sufficient in supporting high growth rates of diatoms anderson 2000 we assumed that riparian vegetation is the same as the surrounding landscape this assumption is validated by the lhw survey data in the catchment although the lowland main stem of the selke is dominated by sparse gallery trees gpp values at hausneindorf are comparable with values reported in other agricultural streams e g beaulieu et al 2013 and griffiths et al 2013 and the approach performed well this indicates that the gallery trees do not provide sufficient shading on the stream surface presumably due to the relatively large side to side distance and less shading density of the trees still the assumptions might not completely valid for agricultural or urban streams with a significant buffer of trees planted along the stream corridor however such information is rarely available at river network scale e g resolution mismatching of satellite data and expensive to survey all tributaries and extrapolating the shading effect from on site measurements remains challenging davies colley and rutherford 2005 our regionalization approach focuses on quantifying stream surface light availability other factors are not included in its design water temperature is not explicitly considered because it is not available network wide and spatiotemporal estimates of water temperature can be quite uncertain the impact of water temperature is partly considered by light and is more relevant for er than for gpp demars et al 2011 turbidity decreases the amount of light that penetrates to benthic areas julian et al 2008 which likely resulted in the overestimation of the simulated u a n o 3 in the summer autumn periods of 2014 2015 based on the continuous measurements in 2015 fig s3 we observed a plausible correspondence between the increase in turbidity and the decrease in gpp but the relationship is quantitatively unclear let alone linking turbidity to widely available discharge data for regionalization purposes flow disturbance likely has significant episodic impact on stream metabolism following a threshold behavior o connor et al 2012 uehlinger 2006 the resilience of gpp to flow disturbance is suspected to be relatively quick especially in high par seasons except for highly complicated cases in which successive disturbances occur o connor et al 2012 the impact of flow disturbance is mechanistically controlled by turbulence and sediment interactions o connor et al 2012 which are challenging to determine and require adequate descriptions of hydraulics and sediment properties therefore flow disturbance is excluded from the approach nutrient limitation may constraint the autotrophic uptake in certain cases however the relationship between nutrient supply and gpp increase is also reported as weak bernot et al 2010 most likely due to the already high nutrient levels in anthropogenically impacted streams 3 3 network upscaling and spatiotemporal variability of n o 3 uptake integrating the approach into mhm nitrate model predicted a strong spatial variability of seasonal mean u a n o 3 fig s7 agricultural streams had much higher uptake rates than forest streams mean sd 86 4 1 9 vs 18 8 6 2 m g n m 2 d 1 respectively due to less riparian shading the differences between the two main riparian vegetation types were much smaller in winter 10 1 0 42 vs 4 6 2 2 m g n m 2 d 1 probably due to the universally low winter gr the higher sd for forest streams indicated more diverse uptake patterns due to different shading patterns represented by different lai patterns in different forest types we used only basic information i e global radiation lai and land cover information but did provide the varied seasonality of u a n o 3 under different light regimes by multiplying modeled stream benthic areas seasonal mean gross n o 3 uptake u a s s k g n d 1 was calculated for each stream in the network fig 5 the coefficient of variance cv of u a s s was much higher than that of u a n o 3 cvs of annual mean 1 51 and 0 57 respectively indicating a higher overall spatial variability due to variations in stream morphological properties u a s s varied among areas with the same shading condition two way anova showed that u a s s varied significantly among different stream orders and vegetation types in all seasons a post hoc test tukey s test identified that the u a s s of 1st annual mean 0 27 k g n d 1 and 2nd 0 51 k g n d 1 order streams was significantly lower than that of higher orders 1 77 k g n d 1 for all 3rd 5th order streams due to flow accumulation in higher order streams the u a s s of forest streams differed significantly from those of agricultural and mixed streams except in winter when all values were low u a s s also showed significant seasonal variability in all streams anova p 0 01 however post hoc test revealed that mean values in spring and summer differed significantly only in forest streams the differences in agricultural and mixed streams p 0 50 and 0 93 respectively attenuated due to the larger benthic area in spring albeit generally higher u a n o 3 in summer the beta coefficients indicated that season and stream order had the greatest effect on u a s s whereas season and vegetation type had the greatest effect on u a n o 3 we used the detailed spatial simulations of nitrate loads l n o 3 k g n d 1 from the mhm nitrate model fig s8 to calculate the uptake efficiency i e the uptake percentage u p u a s s l n o 3 100 for each stream in the network u p peaked in summer mean sd 21 4 17 8 when the highest u a s s encountered the lowest l n o 3 table s2 whereas in winter u p values were extremely low throughout the river network 1 0 1 7 due to the high l n o 3 and low u a s s u p was consistently lower in higher order streams e g annual means were ca 14 and 4 in 1st and 4th order streams respectively mainly due to the greater increase in l n o 3 than in u a s s with increasing stream order however all pairs of adjacent stream orders i e 1st 2nd 2nd 3rd and 3rd 4th did not differ significantly p 0 01 in summer this can be attributed to the consistently low l n o 3 from 1st to 4th order streams in summer mean 5 to 55 k g n d 1 respectively longitudinal daily u p in the main stem of the selke clearly showed the strong impact of riparian vegetation on u p seasonal dynamics and its inter annual variation fig 6 critical locations and periods of high n o 3 uptake percentage e g 40 could be explicitly identified the critical period was longer in upper agricultural streams 23 km from the outlet than in lower agricultural streams 11 km from the outlet the shallow impermeable bedrock in the upper selke catchment results in a preference of flashier flow path which prevents n o 3 accumulation in the soil dupas et al 2017 whereas loess sediments dominate the lower agricultural part of the catchment and n o 3 concentration in the soil can reach up to ca 40 m g l 1 due to agricultural activities yang et al 2018 therefore l n o 3 was much lower in the upstream of the selke river than in the downstream especially during baseflow dominant periods this presumably prolonged the periods of high uptake percentage in the upper agricultural streams u p in forest streams ca 12 22 km from the outlet generally increased from winter to spring and peaked in may or june then sharply decreased to a low level mean 3 seasonal dynamics of u p differed among years depending on the spatiotemporal combination of l n o 3 and u a s s the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of l n o 3 had more influence on u p due to its higher order of magnitude compare to those of u a s s in lowland agricultural streams the period of high uptake percentage in 2011 was much more pronounced in streams upstream of the confluence than downstream where the getel stream joins the main selke fig 6 this is due to much lower l n o 3 from the upper selke stream in june october of 2011 mean load 41 6 vs 107 3 k g n d 1 for the five year mean of this dry period and higher relative contribution of l n o 3 from the getel stream 32 vs 15 for the five year mean 3 4 implications an increasing number of water quality parameters such as ph do turbidity n o 3 and srp can be measured at high temporal resolution by sensors the new data thus provide potential insights of in stream processes at reach scale rode et al 2016b however regionalizing those processes remains challenging because in stream processes e g n o 3 assimilation and remineralization always interact intensively and only a few can be individually linked to observations e g the autotrophic n o 3 uptake in this study therefore novel reach scale experimental designs are needed in current future research to provide direct measurements of individual processes e g a new reach scale mass balance approach by kunz et al 2017 can potentially be used to regionalize the in stream denitrification process in the regionalization procedure the selection of key environmental factors is critical at both reach and network scales there is a high risk of over parameterizing approaches based on reach scale understandings we are unable to consider certain influential factors due to data limitations and catchment scale behavior might be simpler than that expected from detailed process understanding jackson blake et al 2017 therefore a parsimonious approach can be an appropriate initial step for upscaling issues kirchner 2006 specifically the parsimony of an approach is reflected in our opinion in two perspectives 1 input data requirements i e the applicability of an approach depends largely on the input data it requires and the accessibility of these data and 2 the parameterization i e the introduced parameter should be easily identifiable and transferable with clear physical meaning the proposed regionalization of u a n o 3 used only gr lai and land cover data which are widely available for entire catchment but quantified spatiotemporal variations in stream surface light regimes well the physical meaning of the parameter u a m a x indicates that it can be measured directly by traditional field experiments and be transferred to regions with similar radiation condition 4 conclusions five year continuous high frequency measurements revealed strong correlations between in stream autotrophic n o 3 uptake and ecosystem metabolism specifically gpp and distinct seasonal behaviors in forest and agricultural streams were observed in this study a parsimonious approach was proposed to quantify stream surface light availability i e using basic gr lai and land cover information and to regionalize u a n o 3 the approach performed well in terms of capturing seasonal variations and improving spatial transferability to different riparian shading conditions the parsimonies of data requirements and parameterization suggest that the approach has a strong upscaling capability by integrating the approach into the fully distributed mhm nitrate model more detailed spatiotemporal variability of n o 3 transport and uptake could be investigated at river network scale which is informative in guiding water quality management this study provides a working procedure for regionalizing in stream process understandings inspired from new high frequency data and upscaling such reach scale findings to river network scale using fully distributed catchment models conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements xiaoqiang
