13655,uncontrolled release of dyes from industrial effluents have led to significant environment pollution thus it is crucial to develop an effective strategy to remove dye molecules from water resources over the past few decades researchers have been investigating the feasibility of using fe3o4 nanoparticles natural polymer beads fe3o4 encapsulated natural polymer beads and other types of magneto adsorbents for dye adsorption most of the results demonstrated that the dye removal efficiency attained by these adsorbents is promising however problem arises when comes to the final decision to select the most suitable adsorbent for industrial implementation in fact there has been no systematic comparison performed among different types of adsorbents hence this case study aims to analyse the most suitable type of magneto adsorbent for methylene blue removal based on a structured analytical hierarchy process ahp first an ahp model was developed via multi level of objective the criteria involved in the decision making were the adsorption capacity the ability to conduct fenton degradation the potential side effect the adsorbent cost the energy consumed and the required downstream separation process our analysis implied that fe3o4 is best to be used for methylene blue removal at its bare condition i e without any modification encapsulation here bare fe3o4 was found to score higher global priority 0 303 than the modified encapsulated counterparts owing to its excellent local weight in the dominant criteria keywords analytical hierarchy process magnetic dye adsorption fe3o4 decision making 1 introduction over the last few decades water pollution has become an international concern due to the existence of numerous pollutants in the environment the pollutants commonly existed in water resouces may include macromolecules such as dyes 1 3 suspended solids 4 natural organic matters 5 inorganic matters 6 heavy metals 7 pathogens 8 and emerging organic contaminants 9 out of all dye pollution is one of the most commonly encountered issues in developing countries the effluents released from textile paper food cosmetics and printing industries are normally polluted with dyes the subsequent contamination of surface water and groundwater by these dyes has caused severe problems to the aquatic life and the environment 10 in fact it was reported that the textile industry effluent typically contains 0 6 0 8 g l of dye 10 worst still some of the dyes are toxic and carcinogenic to the living organisms in particular methylene blue can stimulate and permanently injure the eyes of human and animals 11 12 meanwhile eating food contaminated with methylene blue results in nausea vomiting profuse sweating mental confusion and methemoglobinemia 12 14 the dye molecules may also shield light penetration in the water medium subsequently affecting the photosynthesis of aquatic plants worthy to highlight that some of the dyes are hardly degradable and removed from the wastewater by the conventional wastewater treatment system 15 16 and the discharge limit of color shall not exceed 100 pt co units in malaysia as accordance to the textile industry wastewater discharge quality standards 17 to deal with water contamination issue related to dye pollution several strategies include membrane filtration 18 19 ozonation 20 21 electrochemical treatment 22 adsorption 23 25 coagulation 26 27 ion exchange 28 29 and biosorption 30 have been proposed among the techniques used for dye removal adsorption with nanoadsorbents is recognized as an economic efficient and effective technique due to the unique high specific surface area possessed by nanoadsorbent 31 and minimal sludge production 32 among the metal oxide based nanoadsorbents iron oxide is frequently studied due to its intrinsic magnetic properties such characteristic eases the subsequent separation processes owing to the aforementioned advantages many researchers have used fe3o4 and its derivatives for dye adsorption 33 35 despite of that natural polymer beads 36 38 fe3o4 encapsulated natural polymers 39 41 and various types of surface modified magneto adsorbents have been evaluated for their dye removal efficiency all of their results have depicted a promising usage of these adsorbents for dye removal nevertheless it is rather challenging to decide the best adsorbent to be employed one of the possible strategies to make such decision is via analytical hierarchy process ahp method ahp breaks the decision making into a hierarchy of relevant criteria in fact this method is useful for decision making in wastewater treatment for instance it was used to select the most suitable coagulant for textile wastewater treatment 42 to select the best adsorbent for optimal heavy metal ion removal 43 and to select the most suitable process to remove reactive red 198 dye from textile wastewater 44 to the best of the authors knowledge there is limited to almost no study done on the uses of ahp to select a suitable magneto adsorbent for methylene blue removal thus the present study aims to perform ahp for decision making on the most suitable magneto adsorbent for methylene blue removal in specific comparison was done on four types of adsorbents namely bare fe3o4 nanoparticles 45 silica colloid poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride fe3o4 nanocomposite silica pdda fe3o4 1 alginate bead ab 3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles with alginate encapsulation fe3o4 ab 3 note that data inventory was performed on these selected references considering 1 those were previous works published by our research members 2 used the same fe3o4 source 3 and conducted removal on the same dye model i e methylene blue accordingly a more detailed systematic and reliable comparison can be done another reason for such selection is because these four adsorbents have different structures in detail the bare fe3o4 represents a freely suspended nano structure without surface modification silica pdda fe3o4 represents a suspended nano structure with multi layer surface modification on the other hand ab has a macro structure while fe3o4 ab consists of cluster of fe3o4 nanoparticles encapsulated inside a macro structure 2 methodology 2 1 data inventory in this section the procedure used to prepare the four types of adsorbents and the experimental procedure used in the adsorption study were summarized 2 1 1 preparation of nanoparticles 2 1 1 1 preparation of bare fe3o4 nanoparticles the bare fe3o4 nanoparticles were purchased from nanoamor inc houston texas usa these fe3o4 nanoparticles were used as received without further purification and modification 45 2 1 1 2 preparation of silica pdda fe3o4 nanocomposite fig 1 shows the major steps involved in silica pdda fe3o4 synthesis first silica colloids were produced via stöber process in detail ethanol tetraethyl orthosilicate and ammonia were mixed at the ratio of 30 1 3 and being stirred for two hours continuously the silica colloids were obtained as precipitate via centrifugation at 3500 g the silica colloids were then re dispersed in 1 0 mm sodium chloride solution for pdda attachment 0 01 g ml of pdda solution was prepared and ultrasonicated then silica colloids were added into the pdda solution at the mass ratio of 1 7 5 under intense ultrasonication the reaction mixture was kept overnight on a rotator mixer with rotational speed of 40 rpm later the formed polyelectrolyte functionalized silica colloids were obtained via centrifugation at 3500 g these polyelectrolyte functionalized silica colloids were then further modified with fe3o4 nanoparticles here 1 0 ml of 0 01 g ml polyelectrolyte functionalized silica colloids was added drop wise into 0 5 l fe3o4 nanoparticles solution under sonication lastly the silica pdda fe3o4 formed was collected via centrifugation at 10 000 g 1 2 1 1 3 preparation of ab a solution of 1 sodium alginate was heated at 75 for 30 min with continuous stirring then the solution was drop wise added into 2 calcium chloride bath to form the solid beads the beads were kept in the cacl2 solution for one day to make sure that the gelation reaction was completely conducted in the whole volume of the beads then the beads were rinsed with distilled water for three times to wash away any unbound ca2 3 2 1 1 4 preparation of fe3o4 nanoparticles with alginate encapsulation fe3o4 ab was prepared using the same methodology as the one used to prepare ab which was described in section 2 1 1 c except that a known quantity of fe3o4 nanoparticles was pre added into the 1 sodium alginate solution the mixture was sonicated prior to being added into the calcium chloride bath 3 2 1 2 process involved in adsorption study all the methylene blue adsorption experiments were performed under batch mode typically a known amount of adsorbent was added into methylene blue solution under constant stirring uv vis spectrophotometer was used to analyse the initial and final concentration of methylene blue inside the solution the removal efficiency η was then evaluated using eq 1 1 η c o c c o 100 where co mg l represents the initial concentration and c mg l represents the concentration that remains in the solution at the end of adsorption process meanwhile the adsorption capacity at a predetermined time t qt mg g was calculated through solution depletion method by applying eq 2 2 q t c o c v m where v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of adsorbent used g table 1 shows the data inventory for adsorption capacity of the four adsorbents 2 2 analytical hierarchy process in 1987 saaty described the steps for ahp includes step 1 define the problem and determine the goal step 2 develop the hierarchy structure from the highest level objective through the intermediate level criteria to the lowest level alternatives step 3 apply simple pair wise comparison matrices for each of the criteria and alternatives step 4 conduct the consistency check and step 5 determine the relative weight of the components at each level 46 2 2 1 analysis of saaty s nine point scale the relative importance of the criteria and alternatives are evaluated based on the saaty s nine point scale as shown in table 2 2 2 2 analysis of matrix the steps for the ahp method using matrix calculation were described as followed 47 step 1

pair wise comparison matrix that satisfying the recommended cr value the global weight of the alternative was determined by summing up the product of the local weight of alternatives with respect to the criteria and the local weight of the criteria 10 a g w i j a l w c i j c l w i j where agwij is the global weight of the alternatives alwc ij is the local weight of the alternatives with respect to criteria clwij is the local weight of the criteria 2 2 3 hierarchical model the critical step of the ahp employment is to develop a hierarchical model for decision making the most suitable adsorbent for methylene blue removal can be evaluated using designated criteria level 2 in chemical engineering the performance sustainability and economic feasibility are the three main aspects being considered during decision making process accordingly based on these three mentioned aspects six criteria were considered including i the adsorption capacity ii the ability to conduct fenton degradation iii the potential side effect iv the adsorbent cost v the energy consumption as well as vi the required downstream separation processes lastly the lowest level level 3 of the hierarchical tree represents four alternatives which are ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 in this work fig 2 shows the hierarchical model developed in this study for decision making 3 results and discussion 3 1 hierarchy analysis on adsorption capacity as shown in table 1 the adsorption capacity for all the selected adsorbents were reported in specific the optimal removal efficiency η achieved by ab was 72 0 3 through eqs 1 and 2 the maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity qt for ab was calculated to be 2 4 mg g meanwhile in the case of fe3o4 ab the maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity was found to be 2 51 mg g on the other hand the optimal removal efficiency attained by silica pdda fe3o4 and fe3o4 were 1 52 mg g and 10 38 mg g respectively apparently the bare fe3o4 without any modification is the most effective in methylene blue removal as compared to other adsorbents table s1 shows the pair wise comparison of these four adsorbents under the adsorption capacity criterion with the use of saaty s nine point scale taking the value 5 at the third row and first column as an example it means that the maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity qt for fe3o4 row is strongly higher as compared with the one for ab column accordingly the value for ab row as compared with the one for fe3o4 column is the inverse of 5 which is 0 2 summation of each column was also computed based on table s1 the pair wise comparison matrix of adsorption capacity was a 1 0 5 0 2 3 2 1 0 25 4 5 4 1 9 0 333 0 25 0 111 1 table s2 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 5 0 2 3 2 1 0 25 4 5 4 1 9 0 333 0 25 0 111 1 0 128 0 202 0 616 0 053 0 512 0 826 2 546 0 215 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on adsorption capacity λmax was 4 062 where n 4 ci and cr were found to be 0 021 and 0 023 respectively note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 see table s3 in supporting information hence the consistency test was approved to summarize fe3o4 scored the highest weight with respect to the adsorption capacity which was 0 616 while silica pdda fe3o4 scored the lowest which was 0 053 ab and fe3o4 ab scored moderate weight of 0 128 and 0 202 respectively the overall ranking for this criterion is thus silica pdda fe3o4 ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 as shown in fig 3 3 2 hierarchy analysis on ability to conduct fenton degradation table 4 shows the ability of each adsorbent to conduct fenton degradation in specific fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 have the ability to conduct fenton degradation due to the existence of fe3o4 nanoparticles while ab does not have such ability fenton reaction is the oxidation process catalyzed by fe ii iii salts in the existence of hydrogen peroxide which will generate radical species in solution and oxidizes a wide range of organic substances with high activity 48 fenton reaction has drawn attention because it is effective to degrade the pollutants in the wastewater since it breaks down the organic substances to simpler inorganic substances 49 apparently only ab is not able to conduct this reaction as it does not contain the fe ions the chemical schemes for radical formation in fenton reaction are stated as below 50 eq 11 11 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh eq 12 12 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ooh h based on the ability to conduct fenton degradation for these four adsorbents table s4 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale in this study 9 and 1 were assigned to the adsorbent that can conduct fenton reaction and cannot conduct fenton reaction respectively the reason for assigning scale 9 for adsorbents that are able to conduct fenton reaction is because this reaction can further degrade methylene blue molecules into less hazardous and colorless molecules a condition favourable for wastewater treatment in the long run based on table s4 the pair wise comparison matrix of fenton degradation was a 1 0 111 0 111 0 111 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 table s5 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 111 0 111 0 111 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 0 036 0 321 0 321 0 321 0 143 1 286 1 286 1 286 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the ability to conduct fenton degradation λmax was 4 000 where n 4 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 4 fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 have scored the highest weight in this criterion which was 0 321 while ab scored the lowest which was 0 036 the overall ranking for this criterion is thus ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 3 3 hierarchy analysis on potential side effect in this case study fe3o4 ab is regarded to have a lesser potential side effect on the environment this is because fe3o4 ab can perform fenton degradation which means the methylene blue that adsorbed onto fe3o4 ab can be further degraded to less hazardous compounds meanwhile its special structure in which large amount of fe3o4 nanoparticles being encapsulated inside ab can induce faster magnetophoresis due to large cluster size and avoid the leakage of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the treated water in contrast fe3o4 has a relatively higher potential side effect on the environment this is because the fe3o4 nanoparticles are possible to be left over in the treated water the left over nanoparticles is hardly seen by the naked eyes and may serve as a threat to nanotoxicity the special structure of silica pdda fe3o4 in which groups of fe3o4 nanoparticles were attached on the outermost layer of silica pdda fe3o4 can induce fast magnetophoresis however fe3o4 nanoparticles might be detached from silica pdda fe3o4 and left over in the treated water under vigorous stirring thus there is still a possibility to cause nanotoxicity to the ecosystem even though ab is biodegradable and biocompatible 51 the uses of ab remain to have potential side effect on the environment this is because ab cannot perform fenton degradation which means the adsorbed methylene blue cannot be degraded the spent ab has to be disposed upon saturated with methylene blue accordingly the methylene blue pollutant was actually being transferred from one form dissolved molecules to another form solid as a result huge amount of ab sludge is produced such sludge is considered as secondary waste and further treatment such as landfill or incineration is needed 52 based on the potential side effect on the environment for these four adsorbents table s6 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale based on table s6 the pair wise comparison matrix of potential side effect on the environment was a 1 0 167 0 333 0 25 6 1 2 1 5 3 0 5 1 0 75 4 0 667 1 333 1 table s7 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 167 0 333 0 25 6 1 2 1 5 3 0 5 1 0 75 4 0 667 1 333 1 0 071 0 429 0 214 0 286 0 286 1 714 0 857 1 143 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the potential side effect on the environment λmax was 4 000 where n 4 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 5 fe3o4 ab scored the highest weight with respect to the potential side effect on the environment which was 0 429 while ab scored the lowest which was 0 071 fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 214 and 0 286 respectively the overall ranking for this criterion is thus ab fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab 3 4 hierarchy analysis on adsorbent cost material cost is one of the most important criteria in engineering industry this is because minimum material cost of achieving the adsorption function is pursued for total cost reduction 53 the material cost incurred to produce ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 are rm 2 75 g rm 12 51 g rm 9 76 g and rm 11 07 g respectively see table s8 in supporting information for detailed calculation as shown in table 5 and table s8 for all the adsorbents the overall material cost was in fact dominated by the usage of fe3o4 this is because the cost of fe3o4 has accounted for rm 9 76 g itself hence ab adsorbent which was produced without the employment of fe3o4 is the cheapest adsorbent meanwhile production of fe3o4 ab adsorbent cost the most with rm 12 51 g because it employed relatively expensive chemicals such as fe3o4 and cacl2 which cost rm 9 76 g and rm 2 01 g respectively on the other hand silica pdda fe3o4 cost around rm 11 07 g despite its production involving more types of chemicals this is because the employed chemicals such as ethanol tetraethyl orthosilicate ammonia solution and pdda are attainable at low cost here each of these chemicals has a unit price less than rm 1 g based on the adsorbent cost of these four adsorbents table s9 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison using saaty s nine point scale based on table s9 the pair wise comparison matrix of the adsorbent cost was a 1 9 3 5 0 111 1 0 333 0 5 0 333 3 1 2 0 2 2 0 5 1 table s10 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 9 3 5 0 111 1 0 333 0 5 0 333 3 1 2 0 2 2 0 5 1 0 604 0 066 0 211 0 119 2 423 0 263 0 847 0 476 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the adsorbent cost λmax was 4 008 where n 4 both ci and cr recorded a value of 0 003 note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 6 ab scored the highest weightage 0 604 as compared to other adsorbents meanwhile fe3o4 ab scored the lowest with weightage of 0 066 fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 211 and 0 119 correspondingly accordingly the overall ranking for this criterion is thus fe3o4 ab silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab 3 5 hierarchy analysis on energy consumption energy consumption is significant in any chemical engineering process particularly in the aspect of economic analysis as the consumed energy contributes to a plant operating cost 54 for all the methylene blue adsorption study presented in this work the energy consumption was in fact dominated by the electric energy consumed by the magnetic stirrer on the other hand energy consumption is also related to the adsorption duration here the adsorption duration refers to the time needed to achieve steady state where the adsorption percentage has negligible increment after this specific time as shown in table 6 the operating time incurred to conduct the adsorption process for ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 adsorbents were found to be 2 h 2 h 4 h and 3 33 h respectively according to e pt with the same power of 0 25 kw the energy consumption incurred to conduct the adsorption process were respectively 0 5 kw h 0 5 kw h 1 kw h and 0 83 kw h based on the energy consumption for these four adsorbents table s11 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale based on table s11 the pair wise comparison matrix of the energy consumption was a 1 1 9 3 1 1 9 3 0 111 0 111 1 0 333 0 333 0 333 3 1 table s12 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 1 9 3 1 1 9 3 0 111 0 111 1 0 333 0 333 0 333 3 1 0 409 0 409 0 045 0 136 1 636 1 636 0 182 0 545 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the energy consumption λmax was 4 000 where n 4 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 7 ab and fe3o4 ab scored the highest weightage 0 409 as compared to other adsorbents meanwhile fe3o4 scored the lowest with weightage of 0 045 silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 136 accordingly the overall ranking for this criterion is thus fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab ab 3 6 hierarchy analysis on downstream separation processes downstream separation process is one of the important criteria to be considered in chemical engineering process this is because the spent adsorbents need to be separated out from the treated water both process complexity and operating cost are highly dependent on the downstream separation process fewer unit operations are required with the use of magnetic particles and thus operating cost can be reduced 55 a separation of ab from treated water after the adsorption can be a major challenge of downstream processing separation processes such as centrifugation or filtration are needed to isolate the ab unfortunately centrifugation and filtration are energy intensive 56 57 on the other hand the application of magnetizable particles in fe3o4 ab enables easy separation with a magnetic field gradient due to the large magnetic cluster size the fe3o4 ab experiences a high magnetophoretic force thus can be rapidly separated it was reported that fe3o4 ab could be separated within five seconds using a simple handheld permanent magnet 3 similarly both silica pdda fe3o4 and fe3o4 can perform magnetic separation however since their magnetic cluster sizes are relatively small as compared to the macro sized fe3o4 ab it is expected that the magnetophoresis rate of both silica pdda fe3o4 and fe3o4 are slower than fe3o4 ab in this regard togashi et al have reported that the magnetic response of a magnetic nanoparticle cluster can be tuned by controlling the cluster size whereby magnetic nanoparticle cluster of larger size has a faster magnetophoresis rate 58 hence based on this cluster size effect the magnetophoresis rate is expected to be fastest for fe3o4 ab followed by silica pdda fe3o4 and lastly fe3o4 based on the required downstream separation process for these four adsorbents table s13 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale based on table s13 the pair wise comparison matrix of the downstream separation process was a 1 0 111 0 2 0 143 9 1 3 2 5 0 333 1 0 5 7 0 5 2 1 table s14 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 111 0 2 0 143 9 1 3 2 5 0 333 1 0 5 7 0 5 2 1 0 044 0 489 0 174 0 293 0 175 1 99 0 701 1 191 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the downstream separation process λmax was 4 042 where n 4 ci and cr were found to be 0 014 and 0 016 respectively note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 8 fe3o4 ab scored the highest weight with respect to the downstream separation process which was 0 489 while ab scored the lowest which was 0 044 fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 174 and 0 293 respectively the overall ranking for this criterion is thus ab fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab 3 7 hierarchy analysis on criteria ranking to identify the most important to the least important criteria for this study a hierarchy analysis was conducted on the six aforementioned criteria table s15 shows the pair wise comparison matrix based on the relative importance of six criteria as shown in table s15 adsorption capacity was given the highest rank out of all an important consideration for the selection of an adsorbent material is its adsorption capacity 59 60 an adsorbent with high adsorption capacity makes the process both technically effective and economically feasible 59 thus adsorption capacity was located at the highest rank among all the criteria besides adsorption capacity another important consideration is the ability to restore the adsorption capacity 59 ability to conduct fenton reaction was being second ranked since this ability implies conversion of the toxic pollutants into safer products and regenerability of the adsorption sites 49 following that cost is also an important consideration when transferring a technology from research to industrial use 61 the materials employed to make the adsorbent the energy consumed during adsorption process and the downstream separation processes contribute to both material cost and operating cost 54 55 however cost can be reduced via optimization such as energy storage system 62 and heat integration 63 hence adsorbent cost energy consumption and downstream separation processes were given relatively low ranks among all the criteria moreover these three criteria were given the equal rank because all of them are contributors to the overall plant costing while most of the main materials eg ab fe3o4 pdda silica used to prepare the four adsorbents are relatively biocompatible 64 67 thus the potential side effect criterion was given the lowest rank among all the criteria based on table s15 the pair wise comparison matrix of the relative importance of six criteria was a 1 1 125 9 1 5 1 5 1 5 0 889 1 8 1 333 1 333 1 333 0 111 0 125 1 0 167 0 167 0 167 0 667 0 75 6 1 1 1 0 667 0 75 6 1 1 1 0 667 0 75 6 1 1 1 table s16 shows the corresponding normalized matrix eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 1 125 9 1 5 1 5 1 5 0 889 1 8 1 333 1 333 1 333 0 111 0 125 1 0 167 0 167 0 167 0 667 0 75 6 1 1 1 0 667 0 75 6 1 1 1 0 667 0 75 6 1 1 1 0 25 0 222 0 028 0 167 0 167 0 167 1 5 1 333 0 167 1 1 1 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the relative importance of six criteria λmax was 6 000 where n 6 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 1 25 when n 6 while the value of cr is less than 0 1 which is within the recommended range when n 6 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 9 adsorbent capacity scored the highest weight with respect to the relative importance of six criteria which was 0 250 while potential side effect scored the lowest which was 0 028 ability to conduct fenton degradation adsorbent cost energy consumption and downstream separation processes scored moderate weight of 0 222 0 167 0 167 and 0 167 respectively accordingly the overall criteria ranking is thus potential side effect downstream separation processes energy consumption adsorbent cost ability to conduct fenton degradation adsorption capacity 3 8 decision making table 7 shows the calculation of the global priority scores of the adsorbents note that the total summation of global priority accurately equals to 1 indicating that the priority count was correctly balanced to summarize as shown in fig 10 fe3o4 scored the highest global priority which was 0 303 while silica pdda fe3o4 scored the lowest which was 0 184 ab and fe3o4 ab scored moderate global priority of 0 218 and 0 295 respectively the overall ranking of global priority is thus silica pdda fe3o4 ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 apparently the bare fe3o4 without any modification is the most suitable adsorbent for methylene blue removal in contrast fe3o4 modified with pdda and silica is the least preferable type of adsorbent in this case study 4 conclusion this case study presented a three level ahp model for the technical problem of selecting the most feasible adsorbent for methylene blue removal here the alternative adsorbents were ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 meanwhile the studied criteria included adsorption capacity ability to conduct fenton degradation potential side effect adsorbent cost energy consumption and the downstream separation processes results showed that bare fe3o4 is the most feasible adsorbent with the highest global

13655,uncontrolled release of dyes from industrial effluents have led to significant environment pollution thus it is crucial to develop an effective strategy to remove dye molecules from water resources over the past few decades researchers have been investigating the feasibility of using fe3o4 nanoparticles natural polymer beads fe3o4 encapsulated natural polymer beads and other types of magneto adsorbents for dye adsorption most of the results demonstrated that the dye removal efficiency attained by these adsorbents is promising however problem arises when comes to the final decision to select the most suitable adsorbent for industrial implementation in fact there has been no systematic comparison performed among different types of adsorbents hence this case study aims to analyse the most suitable type of magneto adsorbent for methylene blue removal based on a structured analytical hierarchy process ahp first an ahp model was developed via multi level of objective the criteria involved in the decision making were the adsorption capacity the ability to conduct fenton degradation the potential side effect the adsorbent cost the energy consumed and the required downstream separation process our analysis implied that fe3o4 is best to be used for methylene blue removal at its bare condition i e without any modification encapsulation here bare fe3o4 was found to score higher global priority 0 303 than the modified encapsulated counterparts owing to its excellent local weight in the dominant criteria keywords analytical hierarchy process magnetic dye adsorption fe3o4 decision making 1 introduction over the last few decades water pollution has become an international concern due to the existence of numerous pollutants in the environment the pollutants commonly existed in water resouces may include macromolecules such as dyes 1 3 suspended solids 4 natural organic matters 5 inorganic matters 6 heavy metals 7 pathogens 8 and emerging organic contaminants 9 out of all dye pollution is one of the most commonly encountered issues in developing countries the effluents released from textile paper food cosmetics and printing industries are normally polluted with dyes the subsequent contamination of surface water and groundwater by these dyes has caused severe problems to the aquatic life and the environment 10 in fact it was reported that the textile industry effluent typically contains 0 6 0 8 g l of dye 10 worst still some of the dyes are toxic and carcinogenic to the living organisms in particular methylene blue can stimulate and permanently injure the eyes of human and animals 11 12 meanwhile eating food contaminated with methylene blue results in nausea vomiting profuse sweating mental confusion and methemoglobinemia 12 14 the dye molecules may also shield light penetration in the water medium subsequently affecting the photosynthesis of aquatic plants worthy to highlight that some of the dyes are hardly degradable and removed from the wastewater by the conventional wastewater treatment system 15 16 and the discharge limit of color shall not exceed 100 pt co units in malaysia as accordance to the textile industry wastewater discharge quality standards 17 to deal with water contamination issue related to dye pollution several strategies include membrane filtration 18 19 ozonation 20 21 electrochemical treatment 22 adsorption 23 25 coagulation 26 27 ion exchange 28 29 and biosorption 30 have been proposed among the techniques used for dye removal adsorption with nanoadsorbents is recognized as an economic efficient and effective technique due to the unique high specific surface area possessed by nanoadsorbent 31 and minimal sludge production 32 among the metal oxide based nanoadsorbents iron oxide is frequently studied due to its intrinsic magnetic properties such characteristic eases the subsequent separation processes owing to the aforementioned advantages many researchers have used fe3o4 and its derivatives for dye adsorption 33 35 despite of that natural polymer beads 36 38 fe3o4 encapsulated natural polymers 39 41 and various types of surface modified magneto adsorbents have been evaluated for their dye removal efficiency all of their results have depicted a promising usage of these adsorbents for dye removal nevertheless it is rather challenging to decide the best adsorbent to be employed one of the possible strategies to make such decision is via analytical hierarchy process ahp method ahp breaks the decision making into a hierarchy of relevant criteria in fact this method is useful for decision making in wastewater treatment for instance it was used to select the most suitable coagulant for textile wastewater treatment 42 to select the best adsorbent for optimal heavy metal ion removal 43 and to select the most suitable process to remove reactive red 198 dye from textile wastewater 44 to the best of the authors knowledge there is limited to almost no study done on the uses of ahp to select a suitable magneto adsorbent for methylene blue removal thus the present study aims to perform ahp for decision making on the most suitable magneto adsorbent for methylene blue removal in specific comparison was done on four types of adsorbents namely bare fe3o4 nanoparticles 45 silica colloid poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride fe3o4 nanocomposite silica pdda fe3o4 1 alginate bead ab 3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles with alginate encapsulation fe3o4 ab 3 note that data inventory was performed on these selected references considering 1 those were previous works published by our research members 2 used the same fe3o4 source 3 and conducted removal on the same dye model i e methylene blue accordingly a more detailed systematic and reliable comparison can be done another reason for such selection is because these four adsorbents have different structures in detail the bare fe3o4 represents a freely suspended nano structure without surface modification silica pdda fe3o4 represents a suspended nano structure with multi layer surface modification on the other hand ab has a macro structure while fe3o4 ab consists of cluster of fe3o4 nanoparticles encapsulated inside a macro structure 2 methodology 2 1 data inventory in this section the procedure used to prepare the four types of adsorbents and the experimental procedure used in the adsorption study were summarized 2 1 1 preparation of nanoparticles 2 1 1 1 preparation of bare fe3o4 nanoparticles the bare fe3o4 nanoparticles were purchased from nanoamor inc houston texas usa these fe3o4 nanoparticles were used as received without further purification and modification 45 2 1 1 2 preparation of silica pdda fe3o4 nanocomposite fig 1 shows the major steps involved in silica pdda fe3o4 synthesis first silica colloids were produced via stöber process in detail ethanol tetraethyl orthosilicate and ammonia were mixed at the ratio of 30 1 3 and being stirred for two hours continuously the silica colloids were obtained as precipitate via centrifugation at 3500 g the silica colloids were then re dispersed in 1 0 mm sodium chloride solution for pdda attachment 0 01 g ml of pdda solution was prepared and ultrasonicated then silica colloids were added into the pdda solution at the mass ratio of 1 7 5 under intense ultrasonication the reaction mixture was kept overnight on a rotator mixer with rotational speed of 40 rpm later the formed polyelectrolyte functionalized silica colloids were obtained via centrifugation at 3500 g these polyelectrolyte functionalized silica colloids were then further modified with fe3o4 nanoparticles here 1 0 ml of 0 01 g ml polyelectrolyte functionalized silica colloids was added drop wise into 0 5 l fe3o4 nanoparticles solution under sonication lastly the silica pdda fe3o4 formed was collected via centrifugation at 10 000 g 1 2 1 1 3 preparation of ab a solution of 1 sodium alginate was heated at 75 for 30 min with continuous stirring then the solution was drop wise added into 2 calcium chloride bath to form the solid beads the beads were kept in the cacl2 solution for one day to make sure that the gelation reaction was completely conducted in the whole volume of the beads then the beads were rinsed with distilled water for three times to wash away any unbound ca2 3 2 1 1 4 preparation of fe3o4 nanoparticles with alginate encapsulation fe3o4 ab was prepared using the same methodology as the one used to prepare ab which was described in section 2 1 1 c except that a known quantity of fe3o4 nanoparticles was pre added into the 1 sodium alginate solution the mixture was sonicated prior to being added into the calcium chloride bath 3 2 1 2 process involved in adsorption study all the methylene blue adsorption experiments were performed under batch mode typically a known amount of adsorbent was added into methylene blue solution under constant stirring uv vis spectrophotometer was used to analyse the initial and final concentration of methylene blue inside the solution the removal efficiency η was then evaluated using eq 1 1 η c o c c o 100 where co mg l represents the initial concentration and c mg l represents the concentration that remains in the solution at the end of adsorption process meanwhile the adsorption capacity at a predetermined time t qt mg g was calculated through solution depletion method by applying eq 2 2 q t c o c v m where v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of adsorbent used g table 1 shows the data inventory for adsorption capacity of the four adsorbents 2 2 analytical hierarchy process in 1987 saaty described the steps for ahp includes step 1 define the problem and determine the goal step 2 develop the hierarchy structure from the highest level objective through the intermediate level criteria to the lowest level alternatives step 3 apply simple pair wise comparison matrices for each of the criteria and alternatives step 4 conduct the consistency check and step 5 determine the relative weight of the components at each level 46 2 2 1 analysis of saaty s nine point scale the relative importance of the criteria and alternatives are evaluated based on the saaty s nine point scale as shown in table 2 2 2 2 analysis of matrix the steps for the ahp method using matrix calculation were described as followed 47 step 1

pair wise comparison matrix that satisfying the recommended cr value the global weight of the alternative was determined by summing up the product of the local weight of alternatives with respect to the criteria and the local weight of the criteria 10 a g w i j a l w c i j c l w i j where agwij is the global weight of the alternatives alwc ij is the local weight of the alternatives with respect to criteria clwij is the local weight of the criteria 2 2 3 hierarchical model the critical step of the ahp employment is to develop a hierarchical model for decision making the most suitable adsorbent for methylene blue removal can be evaluated using designated criteria level 2 in chemical engineering the performance sustainability and economic feasibility are the three main aspects being considered during decision making process accordingly based on these three mentioned aspects six criteria were considered including i the adsorption capacity ii the ability to conduct fenton degradation iii the potential side effect iv the adsorbent cost v the energy consumption as well as vi the required downstream separation processes lastly the lowest level level 3 of the hierarchical tree represents four alternatives which are ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 in this work fig 2 shows the hierarchical model developed in this study for decision making 3 results and discussion 3 1 hierarchy analysis on adsorption capacity as shown in table 1 the adsorption capacity for all the selected adsorbents were reported in specific the optimal removal efficiency η achieved by ab was 72 0 3 through eqs 1 and 2 the maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity qt for ab was calculated to be 2 4 mg g meanwhile in the case of fe3o4 ab the maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity was found to be 2 51 mg g on the other hand the optimal removal efficiency attained by silica pdda fe3o4 and fe3o4 were 1 52 mg g and 10 38 mg g respectively apparently the bare fe3o4 without any modification is the most effective in methylene blue removal as compared to other adsorbents table s1 shows the pair wise comparison of these four adsorbents under the adsorption capacity criterion with the use of saaty s nine point scale taking the value 5 at the third row and first column as an example it means that the maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity qt for fe3o4 row is strongly higher as compared with the one for ab column accordingly the value for ab row as compared with the one for fe3o4 column is the inverse of 5 which is 0 2 summation of each column was also computed based on table s1 the pair wise comparison matrix of adsorption capacity was a 1 0 5 0 2 3 2 1 0 25 4 5 4 1 9 0 333 0 25 0 111 1 table s2 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 5 0 2 3 2 1 0 25 4 5 4 1 9 0 333 0 25 0 111 1 0 128 0 202 0 616 0 053 0 512 0 826 2 546 0 215 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on adsorption capacity λmax was 4 062 where n 4 ci and cr were found to be 0 021 and 0 023 respectively note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 see table s3 in supporting information hence the consistency test was approved to summarize fe3o4 scored the highest weight with respect to the adsorption capacity which was 0 616 while silica pdda fe3o4 scored the lowest which was 0 053 ab and fe3o4 ab scored moderate weight of 0 128 and 0 202 respectively the overall ranking for this criterion is thus silica pdda fe3o4 ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 as shown in fig 3 3 2 hierarchy analysis on ability to conduct fenton degradation table 4 shows the ability of each adsorbent to conduct fenton degradation in specific fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 have the ability to conduct fenton degradation due to the existence of fe3o4 nanoparticles while ab does not have such ability fenton reaction is the oxidation process catalyzed by fe ii iii salts in the existence of hydrogen peroxide which will generate radical species in solution and oxidizes a wide range of organic substances with high activity 48 fenton reaction has drawn attention because it is effective to degrade the pollutants in the wastewater since it breaks down the organic substances to simpler inorganic substances 49 apparently only ab is not able to conduct this reaction as it does not contain the fe ions the chemical schemes for radical formation in fenton reaction are stated as below 50 eq 11 11 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh eq 12 12 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ooh h based on the ability to conduct fenton degradation for these four adsorbents table s4 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale in this study 9 and 1 were assigned to the adsorbent that can conduct fenton reaction and cannot conduct fenton reaction respectively the reason for assigning scale 9 for adsorbents that are able to conduct fenton reaction is because this reaction can further degrade methylene blue molecules into less hazardous and colorless molecules a condition favourable for wastewater treatment in the long run based on table s4 the pair wise comparison matrix of fenton degradation was a 1 0 111 0 111 0 111 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 table s5 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 111 0 111 0 111 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 0 036 0 321 0 321 0 321 0 143 1 286 1 286 1 286 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the ability to conduct fenton degradation λmax was 4 000 where n 4 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 4 fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 have scored the highest weight in this criterion which was 0 321 while ab scored the lowest which was 0 036 the overall ranking for this criterion is thus ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 3 3 hierarchy analysis on potential side effect in this case study fe3o4 ab is regarded to have a lesser potential side effect on the environment this is because fe3o4 ab can perform fenton degradation which means the methylene blue that adsorbed onto fe3o4 ab can be further degraded to less hazardous compounds meanwhile its special structure in which large amount of fe3o4 nanoparticles being encapsulated inside ab can induce faster magnetophoresis due to large cluster size and avoid the leakage of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the treated water in contrast fe3o4 has a relatively higher potential side effect on the environment this is because the fe3o4 nanoparticles are possible to be left over in the treated water the left over nanoparticles is hardly seen by the naked eyes and may serve as a threat to nanotoxicity the special structure of silica pdda fe3o4 in which groups of fe3o4 nanoparticles were attached on the outermost layer of silica pdda fe3o4 can induce fast magnetophoresis however fe3o4 nanoparticles might be detached from silica pdda fe3o4 and left over in the treated water under vigorous stirring thus there is still a possibility to cause nanotoxicity to the ecosystem even though ab is biodegradable and biocompatible 51 the uses of ab remain to have potential side effect on the environment this is because ab cannot perform fenton degradation which means the adsorbed methylene blue cannot be degraded the spent ab has to be disposed upon saturated with methylene blue accordingly the methylene blue pollutant was actually being transferred from one form dissolved molecules to another form solid as a result huge amount of ab sludge is produced such sludge is considered as secondary waste and further treatment such as landfill or incineration is needed 52 based on the potential side effect on the environment for these four adsorbents table s6 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale based on table s6 the pair wise comparison matrix of potential side effect on the environment was a 1 0 167 0 333 0 25 6 1 2 1 5 3 0 5 1 0 75 4 0 667 1 333 1 table s7 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 167 0 333 0 25 6 1 2 1 5 3 0 5 1 0 75 4 0 667 1 333 1 0 071 0 429 0 214 0 286 0 286 1 714 0 857 1 143 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the potential side effect on the environment λmax was 4 000 where n 4 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 5 fe3o4 ab scored the highest weight with respect to the potential side effect on the environment which was 0 429 while ab scored the lowest which was 0 071 fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 214 and 0 286 respectively the overall ranking for this criterion is thus ab fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab 3 4 hierarchy analysis on adsorbent cost material cost is one of the most important criteria in engineering industry this is because minimum material cost of achieving the adsorption function is pursued for total cost reduction 53 the material cost incurred to produce ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 are rm 2 75 g rm 12 51 g rm 9 76 g and rm 11 07 g respectively see table s8 in supporting information for detailed calculation as shown in table 5 and table s8 for all the adsorbents the overall material cost was in fact dominated by the usage of fe3o4 this is because the cost of fe3o4 has accounted for rm 9 76 g itself hence ab adsorbent which was produced without the employment of fe3o4 is the cheapest adsorbent meanwhile production of fe3o4 ab adsorbent cost the most with rm 12 51 g because it employed relatively expensive chemicals such as fe3o4 and cacl2 which cost rm 9 76 g and rm 2 01 g respectively on the other hand silica pdda fe3o4 cost around rm 11 07 g despite its production involving more types of chemicals this is because the employed chemicals such as ethanol tetraethyl orthosilicate ammonia solution and pdda are attainable at low cost here each of these chemicals has a unit price less than rm 1 g based on the adsorbent cost of these four adsorbents table s9 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison using saaty s nine point scale based on table s9 the pair wise comparison matrix of the adsorbent cost was a 1 9 3 5 0 111 1 0 333 0 5 0 333 3 1 2 0 2 2 0 5 1 table s10 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 9 3 5 0 111 1 0 333 0 5 0 333 3 1 2 0 2 2 0 5 1 0 604 0 066 0 211 0 119 2 423 0 263 0 847 0 476 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the adsorbent cost λmax was 4 008 where n 4 both ci and cr recorded a value of 0 003 note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 6 ab scored the highest weightage 0 604 as compared to other adsorbents meanwhile fe3o4 ab scored the lowest with weightage of 0 066 fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 211 and 0 119 correspondingly accordingly the overall ranking for this criterion is thus fe3o4 ab silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab 3 5 hierarchy analysis on energy consumption energy consumption is significant in any chemical engineering process particularly in the aspect of economic analysis as the consumed energy contributes to a plant operating cost 54 for all the methylene blue adsorption study presented in this work the energy consumption was in fact dominated by the electric energy consumed by the magnetic stirrer on the other hand energy consumption is also related to the adsorption duration here the adsorption duration refers to the time needed to achieve steady state where the adsorption percentage has negligible increment after this specific time as shown in table 6 the operating time incurred to conduct the adsorption process for ab fe3o4 ab fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 adsorbents were found to be 2 h 2 h 4 h and 3 33 h respectively according to e pt with the same power of 0 25 kw the energy consumption incurred to conduct the adsorption process were respectively 0 5 kw h 0 5 kw h 1 kw h and 0 83 kw h based on the energy consumption for these four adsorbents table s11 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale based on table s11 the pair wise comparison matrix of the energy consumption was a 1 1 9 3 1 1 9 3 0 111 0 111 1 0 333 0 333 0 333 3 1 table s12 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 1 9 3 1 1 9 3 0 111 0 111 1 0 333 0 333 0 333 3 1 0 409 0 409 0 045 0 136 1 636 1 636 0 182 0 545 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the energy consumption λmax was 4 000 where n 4 both ci and cr were found to be null note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 7 ab and fe3o4 ab scored the highest weightage 0 409 as compared to other adsorbents meanwhile fe3o4 scored the lowest with weightage of 0 045 silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 136 accordingly the overall ranking for this criterion is thus fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab ab 3 6 hierarchy analysis on downstream separation processes downstream separation process is one of the important criteria to be considered in chemical engineering process this is because the spent adsorbents need to be separated out from the treated water both process complexity and operating cost are highly dependent on the downstream separation process fewer unit operations are required with the use of magnetic particles and thus operating cost can be reduced 55 a separation of ab from treated water after the adsorption can be a major challenge of downstream processing separation processes such as centrifugation or filtration are needed to isolate the ab unfortunately centrifugation and filtration are energy intensive 56 57 on the other hand the application of magnetizable particles in fe3o4 ab enables easy separation with a magnetic field gradient due to the large magnetic cluster size the fe3o4 ab experiences a high magnetophoretic force thus can be rapidly separated it was reported that fe3o4 ab could be separated within five seconds using a simple handheld permanent magnet 3 similarly both silica pdda fe3o4 and fe3o4 can perform magnetic separation however since their magnetic cluster sizes are relatively small as compared to the macro sized fe3o4 ab it is expected that the magnetophoresis rate of both silica pdda fe3o4 and fe3o4 are slower than fe3o4 ab in this regard togashi et al have reported that the magnetic response of a magnetic nanoparticle cluster can be tuned by controlling the cluster size whereby magnetic nanoparticle cluster of larger size has a faster magnetophoresis rate 58 hence based on this cluster size effect the magnetophoresis rate is expected to be fastest for fe3o4 ab followed by silica pdda fe3o4 and lastly fe3o4 based on the required downstream separation process for these four adsorbents table s13 was tabulated by conducting pair wise comparison with the use of saaty s nine point scale based on table s13 the pair wise comparison matrix of the downstream separation process was a 1 0 111 0 2 0 143 9 1 3 2 5 0 333 1 0 5 7 0 5 2 1 table s14 shows the corresponding normalized matrix for this criterion eq 6 was used to compute w which was the product of matrix a and matrix w w a w 1 0 111 0 2 0 143 9 1 3 2 5 0 333 1 0 5 7 0 5 2 1 0 044 0 489 0 174 0 293 0 175 1 99 0 701 1 191 the largest eigenvalue of the pair wise comparison matrix based on the downstream separation process λmax was 4 042 where n 4 ci and cr were found to be 0 014 and 0 016 respectively note that ri is 0 89 when n 4 while the value of cr is less than 0 08 which is within the recommended range when n 4 hence the consistency test was approved to summarize as shown in fig 8 fe3o4 ab scored the highest weight with respect to the downstream separation process which was 0 489 while ab scored the lowest which was 0 044 fe3o4 and silica pdda fe3o4 scored moderate weight of 0 174 and 0 293 respectively the overall ranking for this criterion is thus ab fe3o4 silica pdda fe3o4 fe3o4 ab 3 7 hierarchy analysis on criteria ranking to identify the most important to the least important criteria for this study a hierarchy analysis was conducted on the six aforementioned criteria table s15 shows the pair wise comparison matrix based on the relative importance of six criteria as shown in table s15 adsorption capacity was given the highest rank out of all an important consideration for the selection of an adsorbent material is its adsorption capacity 59 60 an adsorbent with high adsorption capacity makes the process both technically effective and economically feasible 59 thus adsorption capacity was located at the highest rank among all the criteria besides adsorption capacity another important consideration is the ability to restore the adsorption capacity 59 ability to conduct fenton reaction was being second ranked since this ability implies conversion of the toxic pollutants into safer products and regenerability of the adsorption sites 49 following that cost is also an important consideration when transferring a technology from research to industrial use 61 the materials employed to make the adsorbent the energy consumed during adsorption process and the downstream separation processes contribute to both material cost and operating cost 54 55 however cost can be reduced via optimization such as energy storage system 62 and heat integration 63 hence adsorbent cost energy consumption and downstream separation processes were given relatively low ranks among all the criteria moreover these three criteria were given the equal rank because all of them are contributors to the overall plant costing while most of the main materials eg ab fe3o4 pdda silica used to prepare the four adsorbents are relatively biocompatible 64 67 thus the potential side effect criterion was given the lowest rank among

and filtration integrated treatment system at low cost for real textile effluent remediation keywords real textile wastewater coagulation adsorption filtration economic evaluation 1 introduction lately with the increase in the world population and industrial renaissance the consumption of fresh water has sequentially increased posing a risk that deserves attention many industries are consuming large quantities of fresh water during various manufacturing processes on a daily basis in particular textile industry has been reported as one of the most water consuming industries furthermore it releases highly polluted wastewaters that cannot be reused in its primary state 1 the textile wastewater is attracting a lot of interest as it contains hazard constituents that can harm the environment and affect public health 2 the textile effluents can be characterized in high ph cod tss strong color and other organic and inorganic constituents 1 3 numerous capable techniques have been established for textile effluents treatment such as nanofiltration 4 reverse osmosis 5 electrocoagulation 6 ion exchange 1 and ozonation 7 nevertheless each one of these techniques has its own shortcomings that are either expensive require regular maintenance or serve limited flow rates 8 on the other side biological treatment techniques have been reported not effective for dyes degradation as dyes have complex aromatic structures and most of them are non biodegradable 9 10 in addition biological degradation requires long time as well as the removal efficiency fluctuates according to microorganisms growth and temperature 11 coagulation flocculation process is the utmost extensively utilized technique for real textile wastewater treatment as it is comparatively easy and low cost to operate 1 it has the great ability to remove colloidal organic and inorganic substances in an easy operation processing 12 moreover it has the advance in water decolorization and suspended solids eradication 13 the integral drawback to this method is the generation of large volumes of sludge that is categorized as risky wastes that necessity to be discharged off in safe landfills 14 therefore it is preferable for the coagulation process to be part of an integrated treatment system so that less coagulant is used and consequently less sludge is discharged the coagulation flocculation process effectiveness is contingent on a number of influences for instance coagulant type dosage mixing conditions ph and temperature 14 the mutual used coagulants are aluminum and iron salts such as aluminum chloride alcl3 aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 ferric chloride fecl3 and ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 due to their effectiveness low cost and ease of usage 15 several researchers have praised the superior efficiency of using fecl3 for real textile wastewater treatment 13 16 17 the elimination of cod tss and color from raw textile effluents has been studied by 16 using al2 so4 3 and fecl3 coagulants the achieved results revealed better removal rates by using fecl3 rather than al2 so4 3 reaching 72 60 98 for cod tss and color respectively in another study 13 has recommended the use of fecl3 for the treatment of raw textile effluents moreover 18 has also suggested the use of fecl3 for the treatment of paper and pulp effluents owing to its great performance obtainability less toxicity and low cost compared to aluminum based coagulants on the other side adsorption is one of the most widely utilized technique for the removal of dyes solvable organic contaminants and toxic compounds from textile effluents 19 over applying this method contaminants in the wastewater are adsorbed and detached on the external surface of a sorbent material 19 nano sized materials were reported as great adsorbents as it can retain advanced surface areas with small particle sizes 20 they moreover have the capability to functionalize simply with a variability of chemical sets and consequently advance their empathy for the mark pollutants 20 on the other side nano adsorbents have the capability to be regenerated where the absorbed impurities are detached by appropriate processes rather than carbon based adsorbents 21 zero valent metals have been utilized for the deduction of countless organic impurities and dyes 22 current studies have stated nzvi as an extremely effective and low cost adsorbent for the elimination of color 23 heavy metals 21 and organics degradation 24 the reason for that is thanks to the nzvi superior surface area and its great porous structure 25 there are several central influences affecting adsorption process for instance ph contact time stirring rate and adsorbent dose ph is the supreme central influences that essential to be measured as it could affect the adsorbent capacity in textile wastewater treatment 3 on the other hand the comprehensive adsorption can be accomplished with an extensive contact time at the preliminary period of the adsorption process a developed proportion of dyes elimination is reached while the adsorption competence drops with growing time pending an stability is accomplished 22 unfortunately adsorption process cannot be applied directly for the raw textile effluents treatment while mostly utilized at low concentrations or with other progressive treatment processes on account of the high price demanded for sorbent material regeneration 26 27 therefore it should be integrated with other effective techniques to maximize the benefits and achieve maximum removal rates at low cost 28 the filtration process can trap escaped adsorbent particles with treated water it can also eradicate huge percentage of suspended solids and organic matter present in wastewaters 1 moreover filtration process could support in color odor turbidity and some pathogenic bacteria removal from effluents 8 the selection of the effective size for the filter media is highly significant as excessively smaller sizes may tip to clogging and also excessively large sizes could tip to escaping of suspended particles zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals that have a micro porous structure 29 it can deal with hazardous contaminates and transform them into environmentally acceptable products 30 also it can be utilized in numerous uses for instance filtration adsorption and countless industrial activities owing to their exclusive porous structure 31 recently zeolite was found too effective filter media as it lessen ammoniacal nitrogen and cod since it have great cationic exchange capabilities enormous surface areas and great residual carbon contents 30 31 syafalini et al 2012 evaluated the removal efficiencies of cod color and ammonia from original textile wastewater using zeolite filter at a surface loading rate of 2 84 ml cm2 min zeolite bed height of 10 cm column diameter of 6 35 cm and contact time of 1 5 min the best removal efficiency for cod color and ammonia were 22 40 and 45 respectively 30 recently a considerable number of studies have been devoted to the efficiency of using hybrid systems for textile wastewater treatment 32 33 a successive combination of chemical coagulation process using al2 so4 3 as coagulant and electro oxidation process using boron doped diamond anode has been evaluated for the treatment of textile wastewater 34 the results confirmed the enhancement of the removal rates in case of using the hybrid coagulation electro oxidation treatment system the removal rates have reached 100 for color 93 5 for cod and 75 for total organic carbon toc after 45 min of electrolysis in another study the association of adsorption process based on nzvi with membrane bioreactor has been examined for the removal of congo red dye from synthetic dyeing wastewater 35 the combined nzvi bio system was tested and operated continuously for 52 running days achieving maximum color removal rate up to 99 and cod reduction from 167 mg l 1 to less than 70 mg l 1 rather than the conventional bio treatment system which achieved color removal efficiency 70 and cod reduction from 167 mg l 1 to 116 mg l 1 for the treating identical wastewater in general the single solution unit tends to be impractical and considered imperative to formulate technically and economically feasible solutions by integrating suitable techniques therefore there is a necessity for an in depth evaluation of the potential hybrid techniques along with reasonable analyzes of the cost information available to support economic decisions as cost analysis has been performed on few combined treatment systems the main purpose of this study is to exhibit a developed technique achieving cost effective treatment for better cod tss tn color and turbidity removal from real textile wastewater a continuous combined treatment system based on coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration processes have been evaluated for real textile wastewater treatment under various environmental conditions and different loads of pollutants this paper also endorses the economic evaluation for treating 200 m3 day textile effluents to evaluate the commercial applicability of the proposed treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted by relying on effluents from a textile factory located in the second industrial expansion area menoufia egypt this factory produces about 200 m3 day of highly polluted colored effluents discharged from dyeing and finishing processes for polyester and cotton fabrics the factory relied on only a primary treatment plant represented by coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes unfortunately the treated water quality was not satisfactory and did not conform to the egyptian standard specifications for drainage into industrial drains as shown in table 1 2 1 1 factory wastewater treatment plant the textile factory wastewater treatment plant is originally designed to treat an average daily flow capacity 200 m3 day it operates for 8 h daily during 6 days of the week the textile wastewater is collected in an open channel as shown in fig 1 a where the hydraulic shocks are smoothened and discharged to the elevated oxidation tower the inflow to the elevated oxidation tower is chemically conditioned by adding sulfuric acids h2so4 to control the ph dissolved air is added to the elevated oxidation tower via air blowers in presence of coarse media in each stage of the elevated oxidation tower five stages as shown in fig 1 b then the cooled chemically adjusted textile wastewaters and fecl3 solution is pumped periodically into three elevated rectangular coagulation tanks provided by impellers and then flow into other three settling tanks as shown in fig 1 c and 1 d the operating conditions of the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes in the factory were conducted without any previous experimental studies based on fecl3 coagulant the fecl3 dose was 1 5 g l rapid mixing was 150 rpm at 1 min slow mixing was 30 rpm at 10 min and settling time was 15 min a red color was also observed for the water existing in the coagulation tank as shown in fig 1 c after adding 1 5 g l dose of fecl3 which indicates iron oxidation due to unstudied dose rates after sedimentation the sludge is separated and flowing by gravity to a sludge holding tank while clear water is flowing by gravity to effluent holding tank prior to discharge to a calming room to control the velocity figs 1 displays various photographs of the factory s treatment plant and its components 2 2 chemicals and reagents in this research the subsequent chemicals were utilized ferric chloride 98 5 pure aldrich co sodium boron hydride 99 pure win lab sodium hydroxide 99 pure oxford co ethyl alcohol 95 pure world co and sulfuric acid 97 honeywell co as a sorbent material a prepared powder of nzvi was used mz was supplied by watts water technologies united state co and utilized as a filter media it was washed many times with distilled water to eradicate dust and other contaminations 2 3 nzvi preparation fig 2 illustrates the preparation procedures of nzvi powder gradually using drop by drop method ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was dissolved with a weight of about 1 0812 g in 60 ml ethanol deionized water mixture 24 ml ethanol 6 ml deionized water on the other side 0 7564 g of nabh4 was dissolved in 200 ml of deionized water to be used as a reducing agent then the nabh4 solution was decanted into a burette and gradually fallen into the fecl3 solution at a rate of 1 drop sec a black precipitate was showed immediately after the primary drops of the nabh4 solution after that black nzvi powder was formed based on the chemical reduction between nabh4 and fecl3 as explained in eq 2 then the resulting mixture was stirred for an additional 10 min after the addition of the excess amount of nabh4 to complete the fecl3 reduction a normal filtration technique was run to separate the precipitated iron nanoparticles from the liquid solution using whatman filter papers no 42 diameter 150 mm lastly the prepared nzvi was dried at 80⁰c for 3 h and then saved against oxidation by adding a layer of acetone for storage 36 2

from textile factory located at el sadat city menoufia egypt the samples were collected every one hour throughout the whole working day 8 h subsequently the collected samples were mixed and kept in plastic containers then transported to the laboratory for characterization consistent with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 table 1 represents the average concentrations of the collected samples along with the egyptian imposed standards that must be met to discharge into industrial drains 2 4 2 coagulation flocculation studies the optimum operating conditions for the coagulation flocculation process were obtained from our previous work 13 fecl3 was selected and examined for the optimal removal of cod tss color tn and turbidity from textile wastewater discharged from the same factory operating parameters including rapid mixing slow mixing and settling conditions were assessed at 50 100 150 200 and 250 rpm for 1 2 3 4 and 5 min 10 20 30 40 and 50 rpm for 10 15 20 25 and 30 min and 10 20 30 40 and 50 min respectively the achieved results revealed the higher ability of fecl3 in textile effluent remediation with optimum operating conditions summarized in table 2 2 4 3 adsorption studies in this study nzvi was utilized to eliminate cod tss color tn and turbidity from partially treated textile wastewater after undergoing coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes using fecl3 based on optimal operating parameters obtained from our previous batch studies the adsorption process was examined by batch experiments in 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks the characterized partially treated sample was found to contain concentrations of cod 1362 mg l tss 910 mg l color 218 pt co tn 30 mg l and turbidity 33 ntu to establish the optimal operating parameters for the use of nzvi a single factor at a time approach was used 2 12 ph 0 05 1 g adsorbent dosage 50 200 rpm stirring rate and 5 60 min contact time for elimination of all pollutants tested while retaining other variables constant 2 4 4 filtration studies micro zeolite mz was used as a filtration medium the great ability of zeolite to remove organic matter from wastewater as well as its superior capability to trap pollutants has been recommended from the literature the mz properties such as surface area and average density were 25 m2 gm and 0 88 kg l respectively the optimum bed width and height were obtained from the data sheet supported by the supplier watts company 2 4 5 analytical analysis the textile wastewater samples were analyzed for ph cod tss colour tn and turbidity a multi parameter instrument ph oxi 340i was used to determine the medium ph a spectrometer hach dr 2000 with wavelengths of 620 nm and 810 nm is utilized to perform cod and tss analysis respectively the cod detection was accompanied by the dichromate closed reflux approach a turbidity meter cole parmer was used to measure samples turbidity following the apha platinum cobalt protocol the hach dr 2000 spectrometer was utilized for colour detection at 455 nm wavelength and purified water was utilized as a blank 2 5 continuous feed studies 2 5 1 design a scaling up design was studied for the pilot plant units intended for continuous feed operation fig 3 displays the pilot plant treatment units all design criteria for the treatment units are mentioned in table 3 mixing speed and hydraulic retention time were obtained from the studied batch experiments eq 3 was used to determine the required volume of tanks to accommodate 1 5 lit min effluent on the other hand eq 4 was used to determine the tank internal dimensions 3 v q x t 1440 where v is the required volume of a certain tank m3 q is the daily factory effluent m3 day and t is the hydraulic retention time min 4 v a x d where a is the required area of a certain tank m2 and d is the tank depth 2 5 2 set up a pilot plant was built up to produce about 1 5 l min in continuous feed operations using real textile effluent samples from textile factory located in el sadat city egypt fig 3 shows a photograph of the pilot plant all treatment units of the pilot plant were made from plastic material the pilot plant treatment units included feeding tank 100 l for textile wastewater samples storage mixing tank 1 5 l with overhead stirrer set to 150 rpm flocculation tank 30 l with overhead stirrer set to 30 rpm two sedimentation tanks 11 25 l for each tank adsorption tank 30 l with a mixer of 150 rpm and mz filter 2 l the mixing tank was fed through the storage tank with an untreated textile wastewater and then conveyed water to all other treatment units under the influence of gravity as shown in fig 3 manual control valves were used to adjust the influent flow rate to be 1 5 l min for all treatment units and 0 75 l min for each settling unit the coagulant and sorbent materials were weighed using high precision sensitive scale and added manually according to the optimum doses obtained from the previous batch studies the mz media was not replaced throughout the study period it was washed once after every two days of continuous use to maintain high efficiency 2 5 3 sampling program in this study the whole experiments executed for continuous feed operations were six runs at the rate of one run per day for six consecutive days raw and partially treated textile wastewater samples were collected from the factory effluent before and after exposing the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation treatment the ph of the samples was measured onsite in addition samples were taken from the pilot plant as shown in fig 4 to assess the efficiency of each treatment stage all samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory for chemical characterization according to standard methods apha 2005 the parameters of interest which measured for each sample were the following cod tss color tn and turbidity sample characterization was conducted once per day for the raw sample which supplies the pilot plant with effluent during a whole day moreover the partially treated samples were measured once per day 2 6 economic evaluation the economic feasibility study is at the heart of understanding the possibility of applying the proposed treatment system shown in fig 4 the ideal conditions were assimilated based on the prior batch experiments ph 9 1 g l coagulant dose 150 rpm in 1 min rapid mixing 30 rpm in 20 min slow mixing and 30 min settling time for coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes as well as ph 6 contact time 20 min and stirring rate 100 rpm 0 8 g l adsorbent dose for adsorption process the economic analysis was conducted on the basis of 200 m3 day effluent the factory working hours are 8 h daily during 6 days of the week all equipment and material prices were collected from diverse treatment plant equipment suppliers in egypt 2 6 1 total cost tc total cost was calculated by considering four sub stages construction cost mechanical and electrical cost operating cost and other costs 2 6 1 1 construction cost the construction cost of the treatment units is the main cost that cannot be overlooked it was considered as the cost of treatment units manufacturing the recommended material for all treatment tanks is galvanized steel therefore the cost of excavation and civil works has been replaced by the cost of manufacturing and rust insulation on the other side the land costs were omitted from the calculations as it related to the factory own site usage 2 6 1 2 mechanical and electrical cost mechanical and electrical instruments costs are another significant capital costs for a treatment plant mechanical costs were calculated by summing the costs of mechanical equipment purchase pipes and fittings lift pumps dosage pumps mixers blowers diffusers filter press tank skimmers and etc on the other hand the electrical instruments cost contains wiring flow sensors ph sensors oxygen sensors sensors automation and etc 2 6 1 3 operating and maintenance costs operation costs include chemicals power requirement maintenance technicians and labors costs the sludge emerging from the textile wastewater treatment plants was considered hazardous waste to the environment 38 consequently the sludge disposal cost has been excluded from the calculations as it fully depends on the applied disposal technique of the sludge the chemicals cost was calculated by eq 5 moreover the energy consumption cost was estimated by eq 6 5 rc c x p where rc is chemical cost per cubic meter of treated wastewater m3 c is chemical dosage g m3 p is chemical price per 1 gm g 6 e c e x t w q where ec is the energy cost per m3 of treated wastewater m3 e is the electricity cost per hour hr tw is the working hours per day i e 8 h day the technicians and labors salaries were considered based on the average salaries in egypt in addition the workload in such a small plant of 200 m3 day effluent it was estimated to be 375 and 565 month for working two labors and two technicians mechanical and electrical respectively the maintenance cost was excluded from the study as it not a govern criteria for the treatment plant 2 6 1 4 other costs finally other costs could be summarized in material transportation overhead charges and taxes in addition to handling tanks and engineering design fee 3 experimental work 3 1 nzvi characterization fig 5a demonstrates edx analysis to determine the chemical composition of the prepared nzvi powder the analysis definite that the principal sample product is iron which made up 63 84 of the overall sample weight fek 63 84 in addition in very limited percentages certain other elements were confirmed such as carbon sodium calcium except that the oxygen percentage was found to be 28 33 this could be attributed to the creation of iron oxide shells arising from water air reactions with iron nanoparticles during the observing process 21 the xrd analysis for the prepared nzvi powder is shown in fig 5fig 5b the 2 theta angle was detected in the range from 5 to 70 at 2 theta angles of 44 6 and 65 1 two reflex peaks were found respectively referring to the 110 and 200 reflections for α fe this finding shows that the sample was dominated by zvi fig 5c indicates the sem analysis of the nzvi powder the analysis revealed abundant pores accompanying with asymmetric heterogeneous structures with a mean nzvi particle size of 3452 nm this facilitates a greater transfer of mass to inner iron nanoparticles 39 3 2 batch experiments 3 2 1 adsorption operating parameters 3 2 1 1 effect of ph the ph effect was analyzed to optimally remove cod tss colour tn and turbidity from raw textile effluents fig 6a indicates the different rates of removal for all the pollutants studied by different ph values differing between particular limits 2 12 other conditions such as adsorbent dosage contact time stirring rate remained constant at 0 8 g l 20 min and 100 rpm respectively at room temperature at low ph values ph 4 the removal rates for all contaminants tested were low it may be caused by the disproportionate presence of h ions on the surface of nzvi particles competing for vacant adsorption sites against textile wastewater cations 40 with the rise in ph up to the optimum achieved at ph 6 a clear increase in the removal rates was observed with overall removal rates of 49 7 for cod 53 1 for tss 69 for color 31 8 for tn and 37 for turbidity this may be due to the decrease in the presence of h ions which can lead to electric pulls between the textile effluent cations and the negatively loaded nzvi surface 41 a substantial decrease in removal efficiency was observed for all the contaminants tested after a further rise in ph ph 6 this could be attributed to the disproportionate rise in oh ions which strive against the negative ions on the surface of nzvi particles 39 3 2 1 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dose impact is also studied for the maximum removal of cod tss color tn and turbidity using nzvi at diverse range from 0 05 to 1 g l fig 6b shows the relationship between dose increase and removal rates while keeping the other influencing factors constant ph 6 20 min contact time and 100 rpm stirring rate at room temperature it was observed that the removal efficiency of all the studied pollutants increased in line with the increase in the adsorbent dose this could be thanks to the increased existence of large vacant sites associated with the increased adsorbent doses 21 the optimal effective dose for greatest removal efficiency was 0 8 g l reaching removal efficiency of 77 1 78 9 88 5 66 and 63 6 for cod tss color tn and turbidity respectively a significant removal rates were observed for all studied contaminants by utilizing nzvi dosage more than 0 8 g l this may be caused by the extra nzvi particles which might overlay the pore structure of the adsorbent 41 3 2 1 3 effect of contact time fig 6c shows the relationship between cod tss color tn and turbidity removal rates and diverse contact times 5 60 min at constant ph 6 stirring rate 100 and dose 0 8 g l at contact times 15 min no discernible change was detected for all tested pollutants however at 20 min contact time a noticeable increase was detected in the removal rates of cod tss color tn and turbidity reaching 49 7 52 7 68 6 30 and 37 respectively a slight improvement was perceived for all contaminants removal rates at contact times 30 min it may be attributable to the nzvi surface capacity and equilibrium condition in similar the equilibrium adsorption rate was reached for the basic blue 3 dye adsorption using nzvi at contact time of 20 min 40 3 2 1 4 effect of stirring rate fig 6d indicates the relationship between cod tss colour tn and turbidity and different rates of stirring 50 200 rpm at constant ph 6 contact time 20 min and dose 0 8 g l the removal rates for all the pollutants analyzed were low at a stirring rate 100 rpm a substantial increase was detected for the elimination of cod tss color tn and turbidity reaching 49 7 52 7 68 6 30 and 37 respectively at a stirring rate of 100 rpm it may be attributed to the enhanced interaction between the molecules of contaminants and nzvi particles that enhances the conversion of liquid solid mass after stirring more than 100 rpm a slight increase was observed for all studied pollutants this may be affected by the disruption of the electrostatic forces resulting from high mixing rates 21 3 3 continuous feed experimental work 3 3 1 evaluation of the integrated pilot plant performance the performance of the integrated coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration treatment system was investigated under different loads of cod tss color tn and turbidity after operating the system on six different runs i ii iii iv v and vi fig 7 presents the removal rates and concentrations of cod tss color tn and turbidity before and after subjecting to consecutive treatment operations coagulation adsorption and filtration processes the cod concentrations were significantly decreased from 3278 to 86 0 mg l for run i from 3410 to 76 4 mg l for run ii from 3010 to 72 6 mg l for run iii from 2972 to 88 3 mg l for run v from 3400 to 76 2 mg l for run iv from 3347 to 86 7 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively fig 7 shows the achieved cod removal rates for all runs it was observed that the cod removal rates were significantly increased to be 91 3 97 2 97 3 97 96 6 and 96 1 for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the adsorption process on the partially treated effluent the addition of the filtration process to the treatment system is a bone of the system s performance in removing the cod the results were recorded to be in average 97 5 for all operating runs the tss concentrations which significantly decreased from 2256 to 48 5 mg l for run i from 2187 to 46 3 mg l for run ii from 2134 to 41 4 mg l for run iii from 2218 to 43 7 mg l for run v from 2297 to 44 1 mg l for run iv from 2452 to 48 2 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively the tss removal efficiency is also shown in fig 7 fair tss removal rates of 66 7 67 4 67 3 63 6 63 9 and 62 8 were achieved for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after receiving the coagulation flocculation sedimentation process however the removal rates of tss have considerably increased to be 97 1 97 3 97 5 97 0 96 9 and 96 5 for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the adsorption process finally the tss removal rates were extremely increased to be in average 98 0 after applying the filtration process the color concentrations were expressively decreased from 848 to 15 4 pt co 853 to 16 2 pt co 832 to 13 7 pt co 841 to 12 5 pt co 861 to 13 2 pt co and 903 to 14 2 pt co for run i i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes as shown in fig 7 the color removal rates after subjecting to the consecutive treatment operations in different operating runs the coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes achieved removals reached 84 2 85 84 7 84 4 82 9 and 82 1 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively a significant color removal of about 98 in average for all operating runs after applying the adsorption process a maximum color removal rates in average 98 3 was achieved after applying the filtration

for run v from 34 5 to 4 8 mg l for run iv from 36 1 to 4 3 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively the tn removal efficiencies were not efficient enough after applying the coagulation flocculation process it was observed to be 18 5 14 4 17 4 15 1 14 8 and 13 6 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively however the tn removal rates was enhanced to be 72 7 71 5 69 7 70 7 71 and 73 6 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the adsorption process moreover the tn removal rates have considerably improved to be 87 1 86 8 81 9 86 6 86 1 and 88 1 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively when applying the filtration process as displayed in fig 7 the turbidity

turbidity was achieved by the pilot plant whole treatment processes the obtained results showed average removal reached 97 5 for cod 98 for tss 98 4 for color 86 1 for tn and 93 5 for turbidity this is due to the efficiency of the used materials and their high ability to break down organic and inorganic constituents 3 3 2 ph results from the results of all runs we can abstract that the high ph values of the textile effluent started declining after treatment the influent textile wastewater has ph values ranged between 9 and 9 6 and then decreased to the range of 6 and 6 4 after the

lately with the increase in the world population and industrial renaissance the consumption of fresh water has sequentially increased posing a risk that deserves attention many industries are consuming large quantities of fresh water during various manufacturing processes on a daily basis in particular textile industry has been reported as one of the most water consuming industries furthermore it releases highly polluted wastewaters that cannot be reused in its primary state 1 the textile wastewater is attracting a lot of interest as it contains hazard constituents that can harm the environment and affect public health 2 the textile effluents can be characterized in high ph cod tss strong color and other organic and inorganic constituents 1 3 numerous capable techniques have been established for textile effluents treatment such as nanofiltration 4 reverse osmosis 5 electrocoagulation 6 ion exchange 1 and ozonation 7 nevertheless each one of these techniques has its own shortcomings that are either expensive require regular maintenance or serve limited flow rates 8 on the other side biological treatment techniques have been reported not effective for dyes degradation as dyes have complex aromatic structures and most of them are non biodegradable 9 10 in addition biological degradation requires long time as well as the removal efficiency fluctuates according to microorganisms growth and temperature 11 coagulation flocculation process is the utmost extensively utilized technique for real textile wastewater treatment as it is comparatively easy and low cost to operate 1 it has the great ability to remove colloidal organic and inorganic substances in an easy operation processing 12 moreover it has the advance in water decolorization and suspended solids eradication 13 the integral drawback to this method is the generation of large volumes of sludge that is categorized as risky wastes that necessity to be discharged off in safe landfills 14 therefore it is preferable for the coagulation process to be part of an integrated treatment system so that less coagulant is used and consequently less sludge is discharged the coagulation flocculation process effectiveness is contingent on a number of influences for instance coagulant type dosage mixing conditions ph and temperature 14 the mutual used coagulants are aluminum and iron salts such as aluminum chloride alcl3 aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 ferric chloride fecl3 and ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 due to their effectiveness low cost and ease of usage 15 several researchers have praised the superior efficiency of using fecl3 for real textile wastewater treatment 13 16 17 the elimination of cod tss and color from raw textile effluents has been studied by 16 using al2 so4 3 and fecl3 coagulants the achieved results revealed better removal rates by using fecl3 rather than al2 so4 3 reaching 72 60 98 for cod tss and color respectively in another study 13 has recommended the use of fecl3 for the treatment of raw textile effluents moreover 18 has also suggested the use of fecl3 for the treatment of paper and pulp effluents owing to its great performance obtainability less toxicity and low cost compared to aluminum based coagulants on the other side adsorption is one of the most widely utilized technique for the removal of dyes solvable organic contaminants and toxic compounds from textile effluents 19 over applying this method contaminants in the wastewater are adsorbed and detached on the external surface of a sorbent material 19 nano sized materials were reported as great adsorbents as it can retain advanced surface areas with small particle sizes 20 they moreover have the capability to functionalize simply with a variability of chemical sets and consequently advance their empathy for the mark pollutants 20 on the other side nano adsorbents have the capability to be regenerated where the absorbed impurities are detached by appropriate processes rather than carbon based adsorbents 21 zero valent metals have been utilized for the deduction of countless organic impurities and dyes 22 current studies have stated nzvi as an extremely effective and low cost adsorbent for the elimination of color 23 heavy metals 21 and organics degradation 24 the reason for that is thanks to the nzvi superior surface area and its great porous structure 25 there are several central influences affecting adsorption process for instance ph contact time stirring rate and adsorbent dose ph is the supreme central influences that essential to be measured as it could affect the adsorbent capacity in textile wastewater treatment 3 on the other hand the comprehensive adsorption can be accomplished with an extensive contact time at the preliminary period of the adsorption process a developed proportion of dyes elimination is reached while the adsorption competence drops with growing time pending an stability is accomplished 22 unfortunately adsorption process cannot be applied directly for the raw textile effluents treatment while mostly utilized at low concentrations or with other progressive treatment processes on account of the high price demanded for sorbent material regeneration 26 27 therefore it should be integrated with other effective techniques to maximize the benefits and achieve maximum removal rates at low cost 28 the filtration process can trap escaped adsorbent particles with treated water it can also eradicate huge percentage of suspended solids and organic matter present in wastewaters 1 moreover filtration process could support in color odor turbidity and some pathogenic bacteria removal from effluents 8 the selection of the effective size for the filter media is highly significant as excessively smaller sizes may tip to clogging and also excessively large sizes could tip to escaping of suspended particles zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals that have a micro porous structure 29 it can deal with hazardous contaminates and transform them into environmentally acceptable products 30 also it can be utilized in numerous uses for instance filtration adsorption and countless industrial activities owing to their exclusive porous structure 31 recently zeolite was found too effective filter media as it lessen ammoniacal nitrogen and cod since it have great cationic exchange capabilities enormous surface areas and great residual carbon contents 30 31 syafalini et al 2012 evaluated the removal efficiencies of cod color and ammonia from original textile wastewater using zeolite filter at a surface loading rate of 2 84 ml cm2 min zeolite bed height of 10 cm column diameter of 6 35 cm and contact time of 1 5 min the best removal efficiency for cod color and ammonia were 22 40 and 45 respectively 30 recently a considerable number of studies have been devoted to the efficiency of using hybrid systems for textile wastewater treatment 32 33 a successive combination of chemical coagulation process using al2 so4 3 as coagulant and electro oxidation process using boron doped diamond anode has been evaluated for the treatment of textile wastewater 34 the results confirmed the enhancement of the removal rates in case of using the hybrid coagulation electro oxidation treatment system the removal rates have reached 100 for color 93 5 for cod and 75 for total organic carbon toc after 45 min of electrolysis in another study the association of adsorption process based on nzvi with membrane bioreactor has been examined for the removal of congo red dye from synthetic dyeing wastewater 35 the combined nzvi bio system was tested and operated continuously for 52 running days achieving maximum color removal rate up to 99 and cod reduction from 167 mg l 1 to less than 70 mg l 1 rather than the conventional bio treatment system which achieved color removal efficiency 70 and cod reduction from 167 mg l 1 to 116 mg l 1 for the treating identical wastewater in general the single solution unit tends to be impractical and considered imperative to formulate technically and economically feasible solutions by integrating suitable techniques therefore there is a necessity for an in depth evaluation of the potential hybrid techniques along with reasonable analyzes of the cost information available to support economic decisions as cost analysis has been performed on few combined treatment systems the main purpose of this study is to exhibit a developed technique achieving cost effective treatment for better cod tss tn color and turbidity removal from real textile wastewater a continuous combined treatment system based on coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration processes have been evaluated for real textile wastewater treatment under various environmental conditions and different loads of pollutants this paper also endorses the economic evaluation for treating 200 m3 day textile effluents to evaluate the commercial applicability of the proposed treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted by relying on effluents from a textile factory located in the second industrial expansion area menoufia egypt this factory produces about 200 m3 day of highly polluted colored effluents discharged from dyeing and finishing processes for polyester and cotton fabrics the factory relied on only a primary treatment plant represented by coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes unfortunately the treated water quality was not satisfactory and did not conform to the egyptian standard specifications for drainage into industrial drains as shown in table 1 2 1 1 factory wastewater treatment plant the textile factory wastewater treatment plant is originally designed to treat an average daily flow capacity 200 m3 day it operates for 8 h daily during 6 days of the week the textile wastewater is collected in an open channel as shown in fig 1 a where the hydraulic shocks are smoothened and discharged to the elevated oxidation tower the inflow to the elevated oxidation tower is chemically conditioned by adding sulfuric acids h2so4 to control the ph dissolved air is added to the elevated oxidation tower via air blowers in presence of coarse media in each stage of the elevated oxidation tower five stages as shown in fig 1 b then the cooled chemically adjusted textile wastewaters and fecl3 solution is pumped periodically into three elevated rectangular coagulation tanks provided by impellers and then flow into other three settling tanks as shown in fig 1 c and 1 d the operating conditions of the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes in the factory were conducted without any previous experimental studies based on fecl3 coagulant the fecl3 dose was 1 5 g l rapid mixing was 150 rpm at 1 min slow mixing was 30 rpm at 10 min and settling time was 15 min a red color was also observed for the water existing in the coagulation tank as shown in fig 1 c after adding 1 5 g l dose of fecl3 which indicates iron oxidation due to unstudied dose rates after sedimentation the sludge is separated and flowing by gravity to a sludge holding tank while clear water is flowing by gravity to effluent holding tank prior to discharge to a calming room to control the velocity figs 1 displays various photographs of the factory s treatment plant and its components 2 2 chemicals and reagents in this research the subsequent chemicals were utilized ferric chloride 98 5 pure aldrich co sodium boron hydride 99 pure win lab sodium hydroxide 99 pure oxford co ethyl alcohol 95 pure world co and sulfuric acid 97 honeywell co as a sorbent material a prepared powder of nzvi was used mz was supplied by watts water technologies united state co and utilized as a filter media it was washed many times with distilled water to eradicate dust and other contaminations 2 3 nzvi preparation fig 2 illustrates the preparation procedures of nzvi powder gradually using drop by drop method ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was dissolved with a weight of about 1 0812 g in 60 ml ethanol deionized water mixture 24 ml ethanol 6 ml deionized water on the other side 0 7564 g of nabh4 was dissolved in 200 ml of deionized water to be used as a reducing agent then the nabh4 solution was decanted into a burette and gradually fallen into the fecl3 solution at a rate of 1 drop sec a black precipitate was showed immediately after the primary drops of the nabh4 solution after that black nzvi powder was formed based on the chemical reduction between nabh4 and fecl3 as explained in eq 2 then the resulting mixture was stirred for an additional 10 min after the addition of the excess amount of nabh4 to complete the fecl3 reduction a normal filtration technique was run to separate the precipitated iron nanoparticles from the liquid solution using whatman filter papers no 42 diameter 150 mm lastly the prepared nzvi was dried at 80⁰c for 3 h and then saved against oxidation by adding a layer of acetone for storage 36 2

from textile factory located at el sadat city menoufia egypt the samples were collected every one hour throughout the whole working day 8 h subsequently the collected samples were mixed and kept in plastic containers then transported to the laboratory for characterization consistent with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 table 1 represents the average concentrations of the collected samples along with the egyptian imposed standards that must be met to discharge into industrial drains 2 4 2 coagulation flocculation studies the optimum operating conditions for the coagulation flocculation process were obtained from our previous work 13 fecl3 was selected and examined for the optimal removal of cod tss color tn and turbidity from textile wastewater discharged from the same factory operating parameters including rapid mixing slow mixing and settling conditions were assessed at 50 100 150 200 and 250 rpm for 1 2 3 4 and 5 min 10 20 30 40 and 50 rpm for 10 15 20 25 and 30 min and 10 20 30 40 and 50 min respectively the achieved results revealed the higher ability of fecl3 in textile effluent remediation with optimum operating conditions summarized in table 2 2 4 3 adsorption studies in this study nzvi was utilized to eliminate cod tss color tn and turbidity from partially treated textile wastewater after undergoing coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes using fecl3 based on optimal operating parameters obtained from our previous batch studies the adsorption process was examined by batch experiments in 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks the characterized partially treated sample was found to contain concentrations of cod 1362 mg l tss 910 mg l color 218 pt co tn 30 mg l and turbidity 33 ntu to establish the optimal operating parameters for the use of nzvi a single factor at a time approach was used 2 12 ph 0 05 1 g adsorbent dosage 50 200 rpm stirring rate and 5 60 min contact time for elimination of all pollutants tested while retaining other variables constant 2 4 4 filtration studies micro zeolite mz was used as a filtration medium the great ability of zeolite to remove organic matter from wastewater as well as its superior capability to trap pollutants has been recommended from the literature the mz properties such as surface area and average density were 25 m2 gm and 0 88 kg l respectively the optimum bed width and height were obtained from the data sheet supported by the supplier watts company 2 4 5 analytical analysis the textile wastewater samples were analyzed for ph cod tss colour tn and turbidity a multi parameter instrument ph oxi 340i was used to determine the medium ph a spectrometer hach dr 2000 with wavelengths of 620 nm and 810 nm is utilized to perform cod and tss analysis respectively the cod detection was accompanied by the dichromate closed reflux approach a turbidity meter cole parmer was used to measure samples turbidity following the apha platinum cobalt protocol the hach dr 2000 spectrometer was utilized for colour detection at 455 nm wavelength and purified water was utilized as a blank 2 5 continuous feed studies 2 5 1 design a scaling up design was studied for the pilot plant units intended for continuous feed operation fig 3 displays the pilot plant treatment units all design criteria for the treatment units are mentioned in table 3 mixing speed and hydraulic retention time were obtained from the studied batch experiments eq 3 was used to determine the required volume of tanks to accommodate 1 5 lit min effluent on the other hand eq 4 was used to determine the tank internal dimensions 3 v q x t 1440 where v is the required volume of a certain tank m3 q is the daily factory effluent m3 day and t is the hydraulic retention time min 4 v a x d where a is the required area of a certain tank m2 and d is the tank depth 2 5 2 set up a pilot plant was built up to produce about 1 5 l min in continuous feed operations using real textile effluent samples from textile factory located in el sadat city egypt fig 3 shows a photograph of the pilot plant all treatment units of the pilot plant were made from plastic material the pilot plant treatment units included feeding tank 100 l for textile wastewater samples storage mixing tank 1 5 l with overhead stirrer set to 150 rpm flocculation tank 30 l with overhead stirrer set to 30 rpm two sedimentation tanks 11 25 l for each tank adsorption tank 30 l with a mixer of 150 rpm and mz filter 2 l the mixing tank was fed through the storage tank with an untreated textile wastewater and then conveyed water to all other treatment units under the influence of gravity as shown in fig 3 manual control valves were used to adjust the influent flow rate to be 1 5 l min for all treatment units and 0 75 l min for each settling unit the coagulant and sorbent materials were weighed using high precision sensitive scale and added manually according to the optimum doses obtained from the previous batch studies the mz media was not replaced throughout the study period it was washed once after every two days of continuous use to maintain high efficiency 2 5 3 sampling program in this study the whole experiments executed for continuous feed operations were six runs at the rate of one run per day for six consecutive days raw and partially treated textile wastewater samples were collected from the factory effluent before and after exposing the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation treatment the ph of the samples was measured onsite in addition samples were taken from the pilot plant as shown in fig 4 to assess the efficiency of each treatment stage all samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory for chemical characterization according to standard methods apha 2005 the parameters of interest which measured for each sample were the following cod tss color tn and turbidity sample characterization was conducted once per day for the raw sample which supplies the pilot plant with effluent during a whole day moreover the partially treated samples were measured once per day 2 6 economic evaluation the economic feasibility study is at the heart of understanding the possibility of applying the proposed treatment system shown in fig 4 the ideal conditions were assimilated based on the prior batch experiments ph 9 1 g l coagulant dose 150 rpm in 1 min rapid mixing 30 rpm in 20 min slow mixing and 30 min settling time for coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes as well as ph 6 contact time 20 min and stirring rate 100 rpm 0 8 g l adsorbent dose for adsorption process the economic analysis was conducted on the basis of 200 m3 day effluent the factory working hours are 8 h daily during 6 days of the week all equipment and material prices were collected from diverse treatment plant equipment suppliers in egypt 2 6 1 total cost tc total cost was calculated by considering four sub stages construction cost mechanical and electrical cost operating cost and other costs 2 6 1 1 construction cost the construction cost of the treatment units is the main cost that cannot be overlooked it was considered as the cost of treatment units manufacturing the recommended material for all treatment tanks is galvanized steel therefore the cost of excavation and civil works has been replaced by the cost of manufacturing and rust insulation on the other side the land costs were omitted from the calculations as it related to the factory own site usage 2 6 1 2 mechanical and electrical cost mechanical and electrical instruments costs are another significant capital costs for a treatment plant mechanical costs were calculated by summing the costs of mechanical equipment purchase pipes and fittings lift pumps dosage pumps mixers blowers diffusers filter press tank skimmers and etc on the other hand the electrical instruments cost contains wiring flow sensors ph sensors oxygen sensors sensors automation and etc 2 6 1 3 operating and maintenance costs operation costs include chemicals power requirement maintenance technicians and labors costs the sludge emerging from the textile wastewater treatment plants was considered hazardous waste to the environment 38 consequently the sludge disposal cost has been excluded from the calculations as it fully depends on the applied disposal technique of the sludge the chemicals cost was calculated by eq 5 moreover the energy consumption cost was estimated by eq 6 5 rc c x p where rc is chemical cost per cubic meter of treated wastewater m3 c is chemical dosage g m3 p is chemical price per 1 gm g 6 e c e x t w q where ec is the energy cost per m3 of treated wastewater m3 e is the electricity cost per hour hr tw is the working hours per day i e 8 h day the technicians and labors salaries were considered based on the average salaries in egypt in addition the workload in such a small plant of 200 m3 day effluent it was estimated to be 375 and 565 month for working two labors and two technicians mechanical and electrical respectively the maintenance cost was excluded from the study as it not a govern criteria for the treatment plant 2 6 1 4 other costs finally other costs could be summarized in material transportation overhead charges and taxes in addition to handling tanks and engineering design fee 3 experimental work 3 1 nzvi characterization fig 5a demonstrates edx analysis to determine the chemical composition of the prepared nzvi powder the analysis definite that the principal sample product is iron which made up 63 84 of the overall sample weight fek 63 84 in addition in very limited percentages certain other elements were confirmed such as carbon sodium calcium except that the oxygen percentage was found to be 28 33 this could be attributed to the creation of iron oxide shells arising from water air reactions with iron nanoparticles during the observing process 21 the xrd analysis for the prepared nzvi powder is shown in fig 5fig 5b the 2 theta angle was detected in the range from 5 to 70 at 2 theta angles of 44 6 and 65 1 two reflex peaks were found respectively referring to the 110 and 200 reflections for α fe this finding shows that the sample was dominated by zvi fig 5c indicates the sem analysis of the nzvi powder the analysis revealed abundant pores accompanying with asymmetric heterogeneous structures with a mean nzvi particle size of 3452 nm this facilitates a greater transfer of mass to inner iron nanoparticles 39 3 2 batch experiments 3 2 1 adsorption operating parameters 3 2 1 1 effect of ph the ph effect was analyzed to optimally remove cod tss colour tn and turbidity from raw textile effluents fig 6a indicates the different rates of removal for all the pollutants studied by different ph values differing between particular limits 2 12 other conditions such as adsorbent dosage contact time stirring rate remained constant at 0 8 g l 20 min and 100 rpm respectively at room temperature at low ph values ph 4 the removal rates for all contaminants tested were low it may be caused by the disproportionate presence of h ions on the surface of nzvi particles competing for vacant adsorption sites against textile wastewater cations 40 with the rise in ph up to the optimum achieved at ph 6 a clear increase in the removal rates was observed with overall removal rates of 49 7 for cod 53 1 for tss 69 for color 31 8 for tn and 37 for turbidity this may be due to the decrease in the presence of h ions which can lead to electric pulls between the textile effluent cations and the negatively loaded nzvi surface 41 a substantial decrease in removal efficiency was observed for all the contaminants tested after a further rise in ph ph 6 this could be attributed to the disproportionate rise in oh ions which strive against the negative ions on the surface of nzvi particles 39 3 2 1 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dose impact is also studied for the maximum removal of cod tss color tn and turbidity using nzvi at diverse range from 0 05 to 1 g l fig 6b shows the relationship between dose increase and removal rates while keeping the other influencing factors constant ph 6 20 min contact time and 100 rpm stirring rate at room temperature it was observed that the removal efficiency of all the studied pollutants increased in line with the increase in the adsorbent dose this could be thanks to the increased existence of large vacant sites associated with the increased adsorbent doses 21 the optimal effective dose for greatest removal efficiency was 0 8 g l reaching removal efficiency of 77 1 78 9 88 5 66 and 63 6 for cod tss color tn and turbidity respectively a significant removal rates were observed for all studied contaminants by utilizing nzvi dosage more than 0 8 g l this may be caused by the extra nzvi particles which might overlay the pore structure of the adsorbent 41 3 2 1 3 effect of contact time fig 6c shows the relationship between cod tss color tn and turbidity removal rates and diverse contact times 5 60 min at constant ph 6 stirring rate 100 and dose 0 8 g l at contact times 15 min no discernible change was detected for all tested pollutants however at 20 min contact time a noticeable increase was detected in the removal rates of cod tss color tn and turbidity reaching 49 7 52 7 68 6 30 and 37 respectively a slight improvement was perceived for all contaminants removal rates at contact times 30 min it may be attributable to the nzvi surface capacity and equilibrium condition in similar the equilibrium adsorption rate was reached for the basic blue 3 dye adsorption using nzvi at contact time of 20 min 40 3 2 1 4 effect of stirring rate fig 6d indicates the relationship between cod tss colour tn and turbidity and different rates of stirring 50 200 rpm at constant ph 6 contact time 20 min and dose 0 8 g l the removal rates for all the pollutants analyzed were low at a stirring rate 100 rpm a substantial increase was detected for the elimination of cod tss color tn and turbidity reaching 49 7 52 7 68 6 30 and 37 respectively at a stirring rate of 100 rpm it may be attributed to the enhanced interaction between the molecules of contaminants and nzvi particles that enhances the conversion of liquid solid mass after stirring more than 100 rpm a slight increase was observed for all studied pollutants this may be affected by the disruption of the electrostatic forces resulting from high mixing rates 21 3 3 continuous feed experimental work 3 3 1 evaluation of the integrated pilot plant performance the performance of the integrated coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration treatment system was investigated under different loads of cod tss color tn and turbidity after operating the system on six different runs i ii iii iv v and vi fig 7 presents the removal rates and concentrations of cod tss color tn and turbidity before and after subjecting to consecutive treatment operations coagulation adsorption and filtration processes the cod concentrations were significantly decreased from 3278 to 86 0 mg l for run i from 3410 to 76 4 mg l for run ii from 3010 to 72 6 mg l for run iii from 2972 to 88 3 mg l for run v from 3400 to 76 2 mg l for run iv from 3347 to 86 7 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively fig 7 shows the achieved cod removal rates for all runs it was observed that the cod removal rates were significantly increased to be 91 3 97 2 97 3 97 96 6 and 96 1 for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the adsorption process on the partially treated effluent the addition of the filtration process to the treatment system is a bone of the system s performance in removing the cod the results were recorded to be in average 97 5 for all operating runs the tss concentrations which significantly decreased from 2256 to 48 5 mg l for run i from 2187 to 46 3 mg l for run ii from 2134 to 41 4 mg l for run iii from 2218 to 43 7 mg l for run v from 2297 to 44 1 mg l for run iv from 2452 to 48 2 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively the tss removal efficiency is also shown in fig 7 fair tss removal rates of 66 7 67 4 67 3 63 6 63 9 and 62 8 were achieved for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after receiving the coagulation flocculation sedimentation process however the removal rates of tss have considerably increased to be 97 1 97 3 97 5 97 0 96 9 and 96 5 for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the adsorption process finally the tss removal rates were extremely increased to be in average 98 0 after applying the filtration process the color concentrations were expressively decreased from 848 to 15 4 pt co 853 to 16 2 pt co 832 to 13 7 pt co 841 to 12 5 pt co 861 to 13 2 pt co and 903 to 14 2 pt co for run i i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes as shown in fig 7 the color removal rates after subjecting to the consecutive treatment operations in different operating runs the coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes achieved removals reached 84 2 85 84 7 84 4 82 9 and 82 1 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively a significant color removal of about 98 in average for all operating runs after applying the adsorption process a maximum color removal rates in average 98 3 was achieved after applying the filtration process as displayed in fig 7 the tn concentrations were considerably decreased from 41 to 5 3 mg l for run i from 33 4 to 4 4 mg l for run ii from 28 7 to 5 2 mg l for run iii from 35 1 to 4 7 mg l for run v from 34 5 to 4 8 mg l for run iv from 36 1 to 4 3 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively the tn removal efficiencies were not efficient enough after applying the coagulation flocculation process it was observed to be 18 5 14 4 17 4 15 1 14 8 and 13 6 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively however the tn removal rates was enhanced to be 72 7 71 5 69 7 70 7 71 and 73 6 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the adsorption process moreover the tn removal rates have considerably improved to be 87 1 86 8 81 9 86 6 86 1 and 88 1 after operating run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively when applying the filtration process as displayed in fig 7 the turbidity concentrations were significantly decreased from 78 to 5 7 mg l for run i from 73 to 5 1 mg l for run ii from 70 to 4 8 mg l for run iii from 73 2 to 4 3 mg l for run v from 75 to 4 mg l for run iv from 74 to 5 mg l for run vi after receiving the coagulation adsorption and filtration treatment processes respectively the turbidity removal efficiency is presented in fig 7 fair turbidity removal rate of 59 56 8 57 56 3 58 4 and 58 6 were achieved for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after receiving the coagulation flocculation sedimentation process however the turbidity removal rates have noticeably increased to be 86 4 86 85 7 86 6 88 5 and 86 4 for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively when applying the adsorption process furthermore the turbidity removal rates were expressively increased to be 92 7 93 93 1 94 1 94 7 and 93 2 for run i ii iii iv v and vi respectively after applying the filtration process in general higher ability of the reduction of cod tss color tn and turbidity was achieved by the pilot plant whole treatment processes the obtained results showed average removal reached 97 5 for cod 98 for tss 98 4 for color 86 1 for tn and 93 5 for turbidity this is due to the efficiency of the used materials and their high ability to break down organic and inorganic constituents 3 3 2 ph results from the results of all runs we can abstract that the high ph values of the textile effluent started declining after treatment the influent textile wastewater has ph values ranged between 9 and 9 6 and then decreased to the range of 6 and 6 4 after the coagulation process the adsorption process has slightly increased the effluent ph to the range of ranged 7 and 7 5 the effluent treated water was observed to have average ph value of 7 3 3 4

13657,microplastics are the emerging non degradable pollutants in natural ecosystems it impacts humans and wildlife mainly aquatic species by getting incorporated into the food chain due to their sizes 5 mm microplastics are common in the marine ecosystems but are also present in the freshwater ecosystems such as in lakes ponds river basins wetlands or even in moist agricultural lands and groundwater this paper focuses on the primary sources detection and quantification of microplastics in wetlands both freshwater and coastal based on research conducted worldwide fibers thread fragments filaments foams and microbeads are common shapes of microplastics observed in wetland ecosystems microplastics pollution has been observed in wetlands with an abundance of up to 5531 particles m 3 and 6360 particles kg 1 in water and sediment samples respectively this study also discusses the recent progress in extraction characterization and quantification techniques in order to identify research gaps such as the interaction of microplastic and heavy metals and organic compounds in the wetland ecosystem microplastics in size range of 0 12 9 5 mm have been reported in wetland biota furthermore ecological concerns are identified in terms of threats and disturbances caused by microplastics to the freshwater organisms present in wetlands finally it outlines the future scope research gap and potential solutions for microplastic pollution research in wetlands keywords microplastic pollution wetland freshwater coastal density separation 1 background anthropogenic organic and inorganic materials either degradable or non degradable are continuously deposited in the environment these include plastics commonly used as packaging materials because of their strength and lightweight disposed of daily in large quantities across the globe 1 2 the accumulation of plastics on earth is a signature of the anthropocene 3 with microplastics detected in different ecosystems such as freshwater or coastal surface water 4 6 marine environment 7 9 remote mountain catchment 10 sediments 5 11 12 soils 167 13 15 and at high altitude in the atmosphere 16 microplastics such as fibers fragments filaments foams microbeads etc owing to their small particle size 5 mm is now a global concern as an emerging pollutant in the natural ecosystems impacting both aquatic and terrestrial environments 10 17 19 fig 1 generally microplastics result from the degradation of large plastics as primary and secondary microplastics in the environment 17 based on their size lambert et al 20 classified macroplastic as 5 mm mesoplastic as 5 to 1 mm while microplastic and nano plastic are 1 mm to 0 1 μm and 0 1 μm respectively even so the term microplastic is widely accepted for particles less than 5 mm size 21 as a variety of species organisms commonly ingests this size of particulate matter more significantly microplastics are transferred along the food chain creating vulnerabilities for both prey and predator through microplastics bioaccumulation disturbing ecosystem functions i e physiological functions prey predator populations trophic transfers etc 22 freshwater ecosystems provide nature based services including climate regulation and water purification 23 however different levels and forms of microplastics contamination in the freshwater environment threaten freshwater species through metabolism disruption oxidative damages and inflammatory responses dysfunction 24 these also cause long term biological and ecological damage 25 27 threatening species survival via decrease in population triebskorn et al 28 reviewed the environmental consequences such as tissue translocation and toxicity of nano micro plastics due to their accumulation in the human body numerous studies have documented the abundance of microplastics in the marine ecosystem 17 29 30 70 80 of which is estimated to have resulted from effluents discharged from land and rivers 31 microplastics have been observed globally in the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 4 13 32 33 particularly in wastewater and other water bodies 34 however only a few studies focused on the accumulation of microplastics in the freshwater system such as wetlands 35 rivers 36 groundwater 37 estuaries 38 etc although microplastic pollution in the freshwater ecosystems received less attention it has been noticed in the sediments and water samples of rivers lakes ponds wetlands and other surface water bodies 4 8 13 32 33 research in freshwater environments has detected microplastics in many continents such as europe north america africa asia and even antarctica 36 39 44 as microplastics are persistent in terms of their resistance to degrade or transform there are significant ecological concerns particularly concerning their impact on the aquatic flora and fauna 45 46 the primary source of microplastic pollution in inland water bodies is from wastewater treatment plants wwtps industrial effluents agricultural drainage household activities personal care etc 47 49 in addition to wwtps urban runoff also contributes to microplastic pollution in surface waters 50 generally water draining from agricultural fields through irrigation and flooding practices carry microplastics to low lying lands in rural areas therefore surface and sub surface waterbodies are the largest reservoirs for accumulating microplastics 28 51 52 further microplastics in the soil and groundwater ecosystems is a severe form of environmental pollution the richness of microplastics either in marine or in other aquatic ecosystems is a consequence of continuous degradation of large sized plastics into small fractions 47 53 microplastics in the agricultural and other soil surfaces are transported to the surface water and groundwater through runoff and leaching associated with precipitation 8 46 54 interestingly significant microplastic pollution in the aquatic environment is through atmospheric transport 55 56 freshwater is a significant pathway for the transport of microplastics 46 sruthy and ramasamy 57 identified microplastics in vembanad lake kerala a part of the vembanad wetland system near urban settlements the lake receives effluent discharged by rivers and streams and runoff from agriculture and pisciculture movement of microplastics among environmental compartments i e from land ecosystems to aquatic environments is governed by discharge rate and morphological characteristics with their respective residence time 20 58 several studies indicate that microplastics act as transporting agents for pollutants such as heavy and trace metals owing to its high surface volume ratios and chemical structure 59 62 microplastics are also known to transport hydrophobic organic chemicals 63 and antibiotics 64 66 in the aquatic systems organic pollutants 67 persistent bio accumulative and toxic compounds pbts in the soil 68 69 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the subsurface systems 70 microplastics are also known as vectors for transferring toxins from the water to the biota 69 71 72 as well as for waterborne pathogens and exotic species 73 74 the fate and transport of microplastics in freshwater systems are influenced by different properties like flow velocity wind speed and direction and the ecosystem structure 75 76 microplastics also transport micro pollutants and pathogens that are adsorbed onto its surface for example the tris 2 3 dibromopropyl iso cyanurate is transported through microplastic in jiaozhou bay wetland and yellow river delta wetland of china 77 78 the chemical sorption process leads to chemical bonding at polymer surfaces in response to variation in temperature ionic strength and ph of the environment in contrast physical sorption restricts the formation of chemical bonds 79 wetlands provide ecosystem services such as flood control freshwater supply by treating the stormwater maintaining the habitats for diverse plants fish and other organisms many of which provide for human livelihoods in addition to aesthetic and recreational values 80 besides wetlands also act as a reservoir both sink source of microplastics the purpose of this paper therefore is to a review the literature and current state of knowledge regarding the occurrence distribution transfer and fate of microplastics in the wetlands b critically analyze the methods for the extraction of microplastics from water matrix sediments and wetland biota c draw attention to ecological concerns of microplastic pollution d evaluate the interaction of heavy metals and organic compounds with microplastics and e address the existing scientific gaps in current knowledge potential research perspective and recommendations for future studies to understand the microplastic pollution and management in wetland ecosystems 2 primary sources of microplastic in the wetland ecosystems anthropogenic activities encourage microplastic pollution in the wetland ecosystems although wetlands are recognized as natural filters for water purification the primary sources of microplastics in freshwater wetlands are those dumped directly by industries household activities and treatment plants however for coastal wetlands the same sources of microplastics reach through rivers floods and tidal processes fig 2 in this section an intensive review of potential sources of microplastics in freshwater and coastal wetlands has been conducted to provide a better understanding of microplastic contamination in wetlands 2 1 microplastic pollution in freshwater wetlands limited research reported the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystem about 4 as compared with the marine environment 21 81 microplastics in freshwater ecosystems have resulted from the point and non point sources primarily via effluents and sludge 82 for freshwater wetlands microplastic concentrations vary with space and time as reported for river trent and river leen uk 83 and antua river portugal 84 the abundance of microplastics in wetlands depend upon various vital factors such as investigated locations approaches human interference and a natural wetland system 85 besides meng et al 82 reported that flow regimes freshwater topography and extent of biofouling determine the microplastic transport at spatial scales along with anthropogenic activities microplastics were observed in sediments of the yellow river delta shandong china microplastic pollution was observed even in protected areas with no anthropogenic activity suggesting that protected areas might have received microplastics from upstream cities discharge 86 the water and sediments obtained from floating wetlands having stormwater were investigated and microplastics pollution was evident in the form of synthetic rubbers from tire particles in the sediments and water samples 87 the freshwater bodies in urban areas with dense populations have reported high microplastic content 50 85 in urban wetlands microplastic pollution is associated with land use for example greater melbourne australia has 20 urban wetlands which receives effluents from various land uses such as commercial and industrial in addition to household activities 88 similarly microplastic pollution was also reported in the terrestrial wetlands of china s suburban area 89 besides playa wetlands texas showed that surface runoff was contributing microplastics 0 64 mg l 1 to 5 51 mg l 1 in freshwater from personal care stuffs by wastewater pathways and discarded plastics through surface runoff 50 2 2 microplastic pollution in coastal wetlands in addition to freshwater wetlands microplastics have also been reported in coastal wetlands coastal wetlands are prone to microplastic contamination due to extensive anthropogenic pressure such as through sewage inputs and hydrological features such as tides 90 for example sediments from kenilworth park and aquatic gardens the freshwater tidal wetland of washington dc was reported having an abundance of microplastics which had accumulated over a long time 14 microplastics have been extracted from the sediments of inland and freshwater wetlands as well as intertidal or supratidal wetlands plastics and microfibers were obtained in sediments macro invertebrates and shorebirds from intertidal wetlands of west africa and southern europe such as tejo estuary portugal banc d arguin mauritania and bijagos archipelago guinea bissau 90 the qualitative study on the extraction of microplastics on qinzhou bay china having sandy beaches and mangrove wetlands in different hydro geomorphological characteristics of wetlands such as channels and runoffs wetland restoration stabilization ponds sediment loads erosion etc had reported significant microplastics pollution the intertidal beaches with wetlands inside the mangrove have fewer microplastics than supratidal beaches and outside of mangrove wetlands 35 the coastal mangroves encourage microplastics retention from terrestrial as well as marine sources it has been observed that microplastic from foamed stuff accidental leaking defragmented particles from parent materials were found in several coastal wetlands of southeast china 91 the distribution and abundance of microplastic pollution are less explored in mangroves or vegetated wetlands even though vegetated wetlands play a significant role in trapping microplastics for example the sediments from vegetation rich clayey mangroves and salt marsh wetlands reported microplastic pollution 92 94 microplastics obtained from china s coastal wetlands were extracted from soil sediments and analyzed using hyperspectral imaging techniques and other conventional approaches 95 winyah bay the largest freshwater tidal wetland of the usa received effluent drained from power plants industries and agricultural activities where microplastics were extracted from the intertidal sediments 96 most interestingly mangrove restoration promotes microplastics distribution and accumulation in wetlands which raised concern regarding conservation and management in jinjiang estuary fujian china a high concentration of microplastics was found in mangroves after restoration depending upon the plantation pattern p 0 05 mangrove roots as well as dead branches which dominate the microplastics accumulation regions 97 3 extraction and abundance of microplastics in the freshwater and coastal wetlands accumulation of microplastics in the marine environment is common across the globe a few studies have also reported the varying concentration of microplastic pollution in wetland sediments and tissues of living organisms such as their guts digestive tract etc table 1 the separation process was followed by extraction and characterization to determine the extent of microplastic pollution in different wetlands in this section extraction and characterization techniques of microplastics have been discussed by focusing on microplastics in wetlands the abundance and distribution of microplastics in different freshwater i e urban floating and coastal such as vegetated mangrove intertidal supratidal ecosystems have been discussed along with the studies related to laboratory experiments for the widespread overview later abundance and extraction techniques of microplastics have been explored from wetland organisms along with the characterization of extracted microplastics as well 3 1 extraction and characterization techniques of microplastics from water and sediments matrices the extraction of microplastics from aquatic environments depends upon analytical methods for example the density separation and alkali digestion techniques were applied for exploring microplastics from coastal urban and freshwater wetlands numerous studies revealed different extraction techniques for microplastics separation either from sediments or water samples table 1 in general the density of plastics has been found to be 1 02 1 03 g cm 3 110 however microplastics such as polyethylene terephthalate pet nylon and polystyrene ps have a density of 1 37 1 15 and 1 05 g cm 3 respectively 111 112 the microplastics with distinct density have also been observed for other types for example polyethylene 0 89 g cm 3 and polyvinyl chloride 1 38 g cm 3 in the aquatic ecosystem 113 115 in table 1 fibers fragments beads filaments and foams are sorted microplastics observed through density separation 88 89 98 a few studies conducted globally for microplastic pollution in sediments of the different freshwater ecosystems such as lake huron canada usa rivers elique lake geneva switzerland france maipo chile lake garda italy saint lawrence river canada and river ganga india 36 116 120 121 123 for each ecosystem the density separation was conducted for the extraction of microplastics using different salt solutions such as sodium chloride nacl zinc chloride zncl2 seawater etc the salt solutions such as calcium chloride 1 30 1 35 g cm 3 sodium chloride 1 2 g cm 3 sodium polytungstate 1 4 g cm 3 sodium iodide 1 6 g cm 3 and zinc chloride 1 5 1 7 g cm 3 had been incorporated for density separation 30 124 in previous density separation studies zinc chloride was applied for density difference in the solution for microplastics extraction however zinc chloride has been reported as a hazardous solution as compared to sodium chloride or iodide 114 125 126 therefore the environment friendly and non explosive salt solution such as sodium chloride has been preferred widely for extracting microplastics through the density separation method consequently hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been applied for chemical destruction to remove undesired or interfering substances 94 96 generally for quantification and identification of microplastics the micro fourier transform infrared μ ftir spectroscopy has been utilized through the identification of its polymeric properties in wetlands different polymers such as polystyrene polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyvinyl chloride polyamide and acrylic have been observed during microplastics extraction through density separation table 1 87 94 96 besides the evidence of polyamide microplastics investigated using ftir is observed from nylon materials cloths and fishing nets as a potential source in setiu wetland malaysia 98 in ftir analysis the polymeric characterization of microplastics depicted nh amine c h aliphatic and cn amide stretching vibration which emphasized the presence of microplastic residues of nylon materials cloths and fishing nets 98 3 2 microplastics abundance and distribution in freshwater wetlands nowadays microplastics are getting transferred into various aquatic ecosystems from marine to freshwater ecosystems microplastics having particle size 300 μm were found significantly in suburban wetlands of china 89 in that sediment samples were investigated from 20 independent urban wetlands 2 cm deep for both the natural and constructed wetland of melbourne australia the sediment samples were compared using two different density solutions i e sodium chloride and zinc chloride but zinc chloride showed high removal efficiency 60 100 than sodium chloride 10 80 and depicted that the samples were dominantly containing fragments followed by fibers and beads the statistical correlations were applied to understand the relation of microplastics abundance for catchment size and land use type separately using spearman rank smirnov correlations therefore it has been stated that no significant correlations exist between abundance with catchment size spearman rank correlation ρ 0 25 0 33 p 0 05 n 20 for major land use types like negatively correlated for open spaces ρ 0 79 p 0 001 n 20 but positively correlated for industrial area ρ 0 61 p 0 004 n 20 another study concluded that land use such as commercial residential industrial open space etc and catchment activities were contributing to microplastic pollution because of plastic litter degradation and industrial activity 88 as evidence of synthesized microplastics are unknown from tire particles samples of sediments and water collected from a floating treatment freshwater wetland gold coast australia were first digested and undergone density separation using sodium iodide solution for microplastic extraction it was reported that floating wetlands were highly contaminated with tire particles 595 120 and 320 42 particles kg 1 of dry sediment at inlet and outlet respectively 87 therefore the fate and transport of synthetic microplastics need to be investigated in wetlands so that the floating treatment wetlands can control microplastic pollution to surface water bodies 3 3 abundance and distribution of microplastics in coastal mangroves mangroves have been reported as the significant reservoir of the microplastic the mangroves as well as salty marsh characteristics and habitats contain a high quantity of microplastics because of the retaining or trapping of plastics microplastics in the vegetation as shown in fig 3 35 92 93 the association between microplastic pollution and vegetation density is poorly investigated yet for vegetated wetlands the inner zone and adjacent coastlines of intertidal wetlands are generally covered with mangroves which dominated the retention of microplastic besides it accelerates the degradation of plastics under the effect of eternal force such as ultraviolet light and high temperature 127 therein the styrofoam waste fragmented into microplastic particles get transported to the coastal wetlands under the eternal force 53 consequently helcoski et al 14 reported that microplastics transport get reduced with vegetation the emerging wetland plants are an effective filter for microplastic the evidence of microfiber accumulation is significantly high 1270 150 items kg 1 in mudflat dense vegetation as well as in drift line habitats qinzhou bay have both mangrove wetland and sandy beaches extracted microplastics using density separation using calcium chloride cacl2 solution and detected microplastic concentrated abundantly on supratidal and outside of mangrove coefficient of variation 1 01 depicting significant variability in the abundance of microplastics whereas in the case of intertidal beaches and inner part of mangrove of the bay it was found to be less concentrated with microplastic coefficient of variation 0 62 the average abundance of microplastic outside the mangrove 2174 items kg 1 was a severe environmental problem than inner mangrove 43 items kg 1 investigated by one way anova p 0 05 statistically polystyrene was found as a significant contributor to microplastic pollution in qinzhou bay 98 35 similarly the intertidal sediments were analyzed from the top 2 cm of winyah bay the eastern coast of usa and the sediments from bay were investigated using sodium chloride solution followed by 30 of h2o2 for removal of organic material it was found that the intertidal sediments contain microplastic particles having a concentration of 221 26 particles m 2 with particle size 63 μm the statistical kruskal wallis non parametric test was applied to observe a significant difference in abundance concerning the sites however no significant difference has been found between concentrations with each sampling site of the bay for intertidal sediments χ2 1 3 df 3 p 0 74 96 furthermore the average concentration of microplastic was observed as 253 26 particles m 2 in vembanad lake in the brackish wetland of india using density separation with sodium chloride solution 57 3 4 evidence of microplastic pollution in coastal wetlands the accumulation of microplastics in urban wetlands have major ecological benefits as it protects the aquatic ecological unit from stormwater pollution furthermore several aquatic and terrestrial species are dependent on urban wetlands as habitats 128 whereas the coastal wetland provides an enormous ecological and economic values for livelihood like aquaculture farming fisheries tourism aesthetic and recreational activities 129 130 which promotes the abundance of microplastics in wetlands therefore studies conducted in wetlands near the populated area recreational sites or industrial activities depicted microplastic pollution 88 similarly the yellow river delta wetland had shown microplastic pollution due to human activities not only at the tourism sites and harbors but also at the protected area having no human activities with an average amount of 136 2060 items kg 1 as compared with no human actions in the protected area mean 1200 items kg 1 the harbor site marked a high concentration of microplastic mean 2060 items kg 1 86 therein zhou et al 91 stated that the sediments collected from 21 sites of mangrove wetland southcoast china was analyzed under sodium chloride solution to extract microplastic followed by stereomicroscope and ftir analysis for size analysis and polymeric characterization the shapes of obtained microplastic such as foams fibers films fragments and pellets are varied because of exposition to various pollution sources fig 4 a the extracted sample of microplastics was identified as polystyrene polypropylene rayon polyester polyethylene and acrylic ranging from 8 3 to 5738 3 items kg 1 of dry sediment fig 4b besides vegetal litter has been identified as a driving factor for microplastic pollution therefore the vegetal litter sediment samples were collected from the top 10 cm depth at the mature mangrove forest of guangdong china here a high density solution of zinc chloride 1 5 g m 3 was utilized for separation of microplastics from vegetal litter followed by digestion using 30 of h2o2 resulting into the identification of various types of polymers for example polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate polyamide polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene 94 looking for evidence of microplastics in the food web it has also been described that the high abundance of microplastics was recorded in sediments 91 followed by macro invertebrates 60 and secondary consumers shorebirds 49 confirming the transfer of microplastic into food webs at tejo estuary banc d arguin and bijagos archipelago almost 99 8 of the total investigated samples were microfibers with an average length of 2 37 2 27 mm on the other hand the concentration of microfibers has a significant difference in the sediments of these three wetlands kruskal wallis test z 19 3 p 0 001 as the 61 of microfibers were found in macro invertebrates the concentration and frequency of microfiber s contamination were reported the highest in tejo estuary χ2 23 9 p 0 001 and mann whitney test z 2 65 p 0 01 respectively in the context of microplastic abundance among different individual species the tejo estuary has statistically significant difference among various species f 3 51 p 0 01 f 0 77 p 0 2 for foraging strategies whereas the bijagos archipelago influenced microfibers concentration and banc d arguin has not been reported any significant relationship with microfibers contamination therefore the two factors were possibly influenced the microfibers contamination in tejo estuary i e fine sediments β 0 36 0 11 f 10 62 p 0 01 and population density in local township β 0 37 0 11 f 11 52 p 0 01 apart from these microfiber contamination in the intertidal wetland of tejo estuary was subjected to be influenced by sediment s grain size and human settlements in the locality 90 additionally in the mangrove restoration process it has been observed that the microplastics get accumulated in mangrove wetland after restoration depending upon the planting pattern and density mangrove roots and dead plants and branches therefore a high concentration of microplastics was observed in jinjiang estuary china after the restoration under different planting patterns which also promoted the accumulation of different heavy metals onto their surface in that study microplastics 0 038 1 mm with a concentration of 980 127 2340 99 items per kg of dry sediments were observed in mangrove restoration regions which is significantly high in abundance than the mudflats regions but the controlled non planting regions have fewer microplastics than restored regions with different planting density p 0 05 97 on the other hand modern technology like the hyperspectral imaging techniques displayed potential to detect microplastic abundance from coastal wetlands of china together with the density separation method the soil sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm layer for the microplastic extraction and identification the extracted microplastics were colored white and black polyethylene confirmed by raman spectrometer with particles of 0 5 5 mm size range in the hyperspectral imaging method for extraction of microplastics such as maximum likelihood mahalanobis distance and support vector machine all three supervised classifications were applied to identify microplastic in soil sediments with the co existence of other stuff out of these three supervised classifications the support vector machine had performed best in identifying white polyethylene having a precision of 84 and 94 recall in contrast for black polyethylene it had 58 precision and 92 recall in the context of the particle size range the obtained polyethylene was 9 100 and 86 99 for 1 5 mm and 0 5 1 mm respectively 95 microplastics accumulation in sediments is common across the globe besides microplastics accumulation has been explored in coastal biota for example microplastics were found in gills intestine and stomach of fishes from zhanjiang mangrove wetland south china 106 in the caspian sea northern iran rasta et al 108 observed a high concentration of microplastics in sediments 3690 items per kg than surface water 4 41 items per cubic meter in the anzali coastal wetland most interestingly anthropogenic activities have been observed that the anzali wetland is a reservoir of microplastics and import towards the caspian sea as a result they affect both wetland organisms and marine biota however transport of microplastics from anzali wetlands needs to be investigated further along the pathways and interaction mechanisms of micro pollutants such as plastics and heavy metals into wetlands and marine biota 4 interaction of microplastics with heavy metals and organic compounds several studies highlight the adsorption of heavy metals onto microplastics due to high surface volume ratio of microplastic particles which led to the transport of heavy metals to the wetland ecosystems 59 62 surface modifications such as adherence avulsions flakes fractures and pits increases the surface area of microplastics which promotes the adsorption of pollutants onto surfaces and allows the transport of heavy metals in the environment 59 97 several studies have been conducted for investigating microplastics interaction with heavy metals in different ecosystems 59 131 133 for a better understanding of microplastic interaction with heavy metals scanning electron microscopy sem equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis were incorporated for surface characterization and heavy metals mapping deng et al 97 stated that mechanical erosion and chemical weathering have been observed on microplastic surfaces using sem eds images and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analysis and depicted the accumulation of chromium cr zinc zn lead pb cadmium cd nickel ni arsenic as copper cu and mercury hg on the microplastic surfaces sem images depicted the mechanical erosion of microplastics such as pits flakes fractures avulsions and adherence however eds illustrated the heavy metals content in the order of zn pb cu cr ni as cd hg the concentration of heavy metal on microplastics was statistically correlated with wetland sediments for hg but it was not correlated for as cr cu cd ni and zn p 0 05 cd and zn concentrations were found to be high onto microplastics surfaces than sediments whereas hg concentration indicated relatively higher in the sediments than the microplastic surfaces besides this microplastics in the yellow river delta have been statistically correlated with the heavy metals using cluster analysis it has been observed that both microplastics and heavy metals are from separate sources therefore no correlation has been found for microplastics and hg however the significant correlation between cd and polyethylene terephthalate recommended a similar source for microplastic and heavy metals in the study 86 several studies illustrated the interaction of organic compounds for instance free particulate and occulated particulate organic matter 134 persistent organic pollutants 135 organic carbon 136 humus and fulvic acid 137 with microplastics in the wetland ecosystem therein the fate of microplastics are predominantly determined by the presence of soil organic carbon in terms of soil aggregation and stability 168 134 138 ren et al 139 showed a positive correlation of microplastics particles size with soil organic carbon and can potentially impact the biogeochemical cycle in the wetlands besides li et al 136 also observed a positive relationship between soil organic carbon content with an abundance of microplastics in sediments of mangrove wetland as a result the stability of microplastics in terms of deposition are enhanced with high organic carbon content and a minimal integration of organic compounds with microplastics in the sediments are not much more significant 140 5 ingestion of microplastics by wetland organisms microplastics accumulation is becoming an ecological concern to aquatic biota not only due to their long persistence 57 but the aquatic microorganisms are likely to digest ingest pollutants the plastics of smaller sizes 5 mm are found as hazardous debris to organisms in aquatic or marine ecosystems few studies stated that the abundance of microplastic in the wetland ecosystem threatened organisms 24 102 microplastics have been found in tissues guts and other parts of aquatic animals such as from the gills intestine and stomach of fishes microplastics are reportedly getting acclimatize into the food web through prey to predator after ingestion research related to freshwater biota recorded evidence of microplastics found in sediments that get transferred into key species in the ecosystems through the food chain to food web 141 thus despite having various studies on microplastic pollution in the marine ecosystem very few literatures are primarily focused on ingestion by birds 24 and wild fishes 142 in freshwater primarily microplastics have also been extracted from different fish species 102 106 faecal matters and feathers 24 in that microplastic pollution studies depicted burden on the freshwater species through microplastic ingestion in fishes however the ecological concern is less understood 143 145 likewise microplastics have also been extracted from different species of fish in zhanjiang mangrove wetland south china microplastics have been quantified from the gills intestine and stomach of fish species the mean count of microplastic in mangrove fish was found to be 2 8 1 8 items individual 1 positively correlated with body length weight of fish 106 apart from this microplastic pollution was bio monitored in urban wetlands of australia through the fish gambusia holbrooki the urban wetlands are receiving microplastic from anthropogenic sources 85 104 not only from sediments of urban wetlands but also fish species such as gambusia holbrooki from nine urban wetlands of australia has been investigated to extract microplastics from their body about 0 6 microplastic item per individual and head about 0 1 microplastic item per individual to establish the correlation between microplastic uptake in different organs such as head and body 104 though ibrahim et al 98 extracted microplastic from the shell of keystone species bivalve scapharca cornea at setiu wetland malaysia later on microplastics were extracted from cage cultured asian sea bass lates calcarifer from setiu wetland malaysia and were characterized 100 similar to this in kendall frost mission bay salt marsh california the wetland fishes such as fundulus parvipinnis mugil cephalus and gillichthys mirabilis were feeding anthropogenic debris extracted from the guts of fishes 102 also the relationship between microplastic uptake with fish size and weight has been established to distinguish the microplastic pollution in the urban wetlands of australia along with microplastic count the morphological shape of microplastic helps to determine the potential sources and contamination of freshwater and marine ecosystems there is limited research on the prevalence of microplastic contamination on freshwater species for example the feces and feather brushings of african duck species were investigated from birds and biodiversity areas of contaminated wetlands strandfontein and barberspan site of south africa the african freshwater ecosystem comes under threat due to heavy contamination received from sewage treatment plants in those studies the collected samples were cleaned with distilled water and residues were analyzed using the binocular microscope which contained flexible fibers 5 mm after that the general linear model glm was applied to explore the abundance of microplastic pollution with sampling location as well as bird species the glm demonstrated that the strandfontein site has high presence χ2 4 70 df 1 p 0 03 and abundance χ2 4 86 df 1 p 0 03 of fiber microplastic in feather brushing whereas no significant difference has been found between bird species with respect to feather samples χ2 1 81 df 1 p 0 61 just an opposite correlations were observed for faecal samples the fiber abundance has been found significantly different with bird species χ2 13 88 df 4 p 0 008 whereas no significant difference was reported for presence χ2 0 46 df 1 p 0 50 and abundance χ2 0 60 df 1 p 0 44 with respect to sampling locations 24 therein the results strongly demonstrated the fiber ingestion by freshwater ducks in south africa which was similar for microplastics found in the digestive tract of 14 ducks in canada 146 and from the lakes of central spain with 44 45 of shelduck feces plastics debris 147 6 microplastics extraction technique and its characterization from wetland biota microplastics accumulation in sediments and organisms have been investigated significantly though researchers have incorporated different techniques for microplastics extraction and their characterization for polymeric identifications consequently literature available on the biological impact of microplastics on freshwater taxa having toxicological effects are less investigated however the gut content in freshwater fishes was generally quantified for microplastic pollution analysis 148 microplastics extraction from the guts shells gastrointestinal tract etc of wetland biota using alkali digestion method has been summarized in table 1 in setiu wetland of malaysia scapharca cornea ingested microplastics sampled in their shell in that study microplastic was extracted from the shell using alkali digestion technique where tissues were observed under 10 m sodium hydroxide naoh at 60 c for 24 h followed by oven drying at the same temperature for 3 h to determine the digestion efficiency in the extracted samples the majority of microplastic particles were filaments 0 12 9 5 mm of blue black brown green grey purple orange red white and transparent color as mentioned in section 3 1 the polymeric identification and characterization were carried out using ftir analysis by associated functional groups over microplastic samples ftir analysis was conducted for polymeric identification of extracted microplastic samples which detected nh amine c h aliphatic and cn amide stretching vibration i e polyethylene and polyamide nature of microplastic in the dried tissue samples the presence of polyamides is depicting microplastic residue from nylon materials cloths and fishing nets in abundance in that the abundance of microplastic in s cornea was reported significantly high which reflects the contamination level in situ 98 the alkali digestion method using 10 m naoh was adopted for extraction of microplastic from the gastrointestinal tract of lates calcarifer followed by the water bath at 60 c the ftir analysis highlighted the presence of alkyl and polyvinyl alcohol chains in microplastic samples in the range of 4 3 15 7 μm size wild fish and cage cultured fish were spatially investigated which presents the high abundance of microplastic in wild fish though the abundance of both fishes reported statistically different 0 05 100 the foraging strategy assessment predicted the accumulation of microplastic by the organisms such as fundulus parvipinnis mugil cephalus and gillichthys mirabilis feed by benthos and water column benthic detritus and invertebrates and small fishes from mud respectively sampled at kendall frost mission bay reserve california as a result guts content has been analyzed from the foraging strategies of consumers to quantify microplastics consumption numerically the gut content was analyzed using the microscope with 10 koh solution based on feeding strategies it has been found that microplastics were consumed by f parvipinnis 28 4 and m cephalus 5 7 in their guts however no evidence of microplastic was found in g mirabillis it also suggested that the anthropogenic debris logged microplastics in wetland fishes as the consumption of anthropogenic debris reported to be a significantly affected species χ2 63 093 df 1 p 0 1 102 most interestingly freshwater bodies are densely polluted with microplastic though the freshwater bodies at remote locations noted a high concentration of microplastics with a low population residing nearby the industrialized area 85 149 7 ecological concern of microplastic pollution in wetlands wetland provides huge ecosystem services to the society though in return accumulation of microplastics disturb its natural services microplastic pollution has the potential to damage and exacerbates the functioning of wetland ecosystem though microplastic accumulation in wetlands is an ecological concern the accumulation of plastics from anthropogenic debris in wetlands is responsible for loss in habitats and a suitable path for accumulation in the food web 102 microplastic pollution made an adverse effect on the marine biota on the other hand in the case of wetland ecosystem the impacts on biota are likely to be unknown 88 only a few studies have investigated microplastics in wetlands biota therein the accumulated microplastic may result in the digestive tract enzyme production obstructive nutrient depletion reduced feeding stimulus and low growth rates in aquatic species 150 the accumulation of microplastics is reported to get transferred in the food web from plankton to large fish 90 151 153 and alteration in their habitats especially in coral reefs 154 microplastics not only affect prey but also to the predator which gets transferred into the food chain 22 the evidence of microplastic contamination to secondary consumers like birds are indicating a serious concern for accessibility of microplastic not only in sediments and groundwater but also to species having trophic links including human beings 90 the microplastic accumulation in organisms has been reported in the number of literature however stress on the organism are unknown yet ustabasi and baysal 155 examined the growth inhibition stress on bacillus subtilis 20 30 inhibition and pseudomonas aeruginosa 20 35 inhibition affected by microplastic under the influence of standard laboratory and seawater conditions respectively as both bacteria has shown significant microplastics surface charge differences between cell walls and microplastic surfaces due to significant inhibition and dose the environmental impacts of microplastics have been categorized into physical biological and chemical disturbances to the environment 156 physical disturbance through entanglement and ingestion of microplastics can cause suffocation and starvation to the organisms 7 157 microplastic pollution was investigated in the freshwater ecosystem to determine the ecological risk to freshwater fauna and accompanying natural processes in north africa and tunisia 158 chemical and biological threats come into existence to aquatic animals organisms and human beings through various pathways and mechanisms after being adsorbed inside the aquatic and human bodies 156 besides this it is necessary to investigate the relationship between microplastics with micro macro pollutants significantly impacting on the freshwater species 8 in general freshwater ecosystems mainly possess different characteristics in terms of salinity debris contaminants etc than marine systems 8 future scope and research gap for microplastic pollution in wetland ecosystem research domain on microplastic is interdisciplinary in which it covers oceanography hydrology chemistry toxicology etc although extensive research was conducted on the marine system but least investigation on the extraction quantification and identification of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystems have been reported in the freshwater system only a few research on the monitoring of microplastics in lakes rivers wetlands estuaries are available yet 50 87 159 160 wagner et al 161 stated that immense knowledge gaps exist for the extraction of microplastics from freshwater ecosystems than marine because of their abundance biological effects and chemical exposure potential in long term studies research progress on wetlands have been compared with other ecosystems and depicts certain limitations and shortcomings related to microplastics pollution research in the wetlands such as sources and pathways sampling approaches adsorption mechanisms of contaminants and ecological risk and management and policy intervention degree of surface water pollution with microplastics is unavailable and very limited in wetlands so it can be projected for interpretation and understanding the presence of microplastics and their influence on the freshwater ecosystems consecutively the appropriate modelling process is required to investigate and understand the critical source as well as the environmental fate and transport of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystems explaining the sources for microplastic pollution and their pathways in freshwater ecosystems are a challenging task for forthcoming researchers 8 a limited amount of microplastics have been found in terrestrial and coastal wetlands which needs to be expanded in other diversified wetlands such as meadows seasonal lake wetlands karst ecosystem and constructed wetlands in the current state of knowledge different counting units have been reported i e items or particles per units of area volume weight and so on the standard and efficient protocol should be developed for quantification and identification of microplastic pollution from the complex wetland ecosystem therefore the efficient and eco friendly methodology must also be opted for maximum microplastics extraction from the soil sediments without introducing any substantial pollution helcoski et al 14 identified vegetation as a natural filter which removes microplastics significantly not only the natural wetlands but also the constructed wetlands have also been identified as the potential filter which removes suspended solid particles 90 97 from the water column 162 therefore the incorporation of vegetation in the constructed wetlands can potentially remove microplastics besides ziajahromi et al 87 recommended for investigating the old treated wetlands to comprehend potential microplastic pollution from the floating method of wetland treatment suitable quantitative and monitoring approaches should be adopted which can identify types of microplastic to recognize the potential source of plastics along with primary and secondary sources 50 the soil physical properties are noticed to be altered due to microplastic pollution in the terrestrial ecosystem 163 however the sediments in freshwater ecosystems is still not investigated microplastics are reported as a vector for toxic compounds chemicals contaminants in the aquatic system i e the toxic effect of microplastics need to be investigated in freshwater systems 140 hydrophobic pollutants likely get adsorbed on the microplastic surfaces however the extent of sorption has not been evaluated under various environmental states e g varying ionic strength ph and temperature for that reason the adsorption desorption mechanism of toxic chemicals on microplastics at in situ conditions need to be considered in prospective studies for the wetland ecosystem the emerging concerns for building hotspots in wetland favor the microplastics accumulation however the concerns for the transport of microplastic in wetland ecosystems are still unknown microplastics also act as a carrier of other toxic contaminants in the natural environment though the ingestion of those impact on aquatic organisms is unknown poor understanding of the accumulation of microplastics in the food web was also highlighted in wetlands through this review therefore the accumulation of microplastics in the food web needs to get instantaneous attention to explore the potential impact on aquatic organisms in wetlands recently few experiments were conducted for microplastic exposure to organisms 148 161 164 165 therefore it is necessary to understand and monitor the ecological risks on the freshwater and marine biota as they consume microplastics silva cavalcanti et al 148 suggested that microplastics pollution are reported to be vulnerable for freshwater organisms in an aquatic ecosystem therefore the vulnerability assessment is further needed to be investigated due to microplastics ingestion and risk posed to human beings as well the vulnerability of predators is likely in more danger than prey due to microplastic pollution exposure prey predator vulnerability analysis will reveal the ecological effects of microplastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems 22 most importantly the life stages of biota should be deliberated during the formulation of experiments to access ecological risks 104 the ecotoxicological assessment studies need to be developed for determining the microplastics exposure to wetland biota which led to exploring the probability assessment in terms of subsistence growth and death changes in organisms at the ecosystem level in freshwater systems 165 in general the ecological impacts of microplastic pollution in both freshwater and coastal wetlands are still unexplored which needs to be further investigated to determine the associated consequences on wetlands and biota wetlands manager must maintain and conserve from not becoming the wetland as the significant source of microplastic pollution 88 however a new mechanism has been developed that ecological engineers are identified as a microplastics fixer in the freshwater ecosystem 166 which can also be incorporated in investigating microplastics pollution in wetland ecosystems like marine microplastic pollution policy initiatives must be developed for understanding the abundance and impact on freshwater organisms and further reducing the microplastics count in the environment 54 lasee et al 50 suggested an additional and efficient monitoring of aquatic environments for determining secondary microplastic pollution 9 conclusions microplastics in wetlands are mainly originating from anthropogenic activities for example agriculture industries and households which became a global concern due to their shapes and small sizes these particles were noted from sediments water and aquatic animals of the wetland globally in this paper the sources uptake and distribution of microplastics have been considered and summarized that the inputs of microplastics in wetlands are related to human activities numerous statistical models have a significant correlation with their abundance concerning location species and kind of microplastic in major wetland studies the extraction of microplastic from sediments and water was carried out using a density separation technique studies have summarized that fibers threads fragments films filaments foams and microbeads are common shapes which exist in water matrices sediments and wetland biota the common polymeric types of microplastics in wetlands are polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene besides it has been perceived that the microplastic get bio accumulated in aquatic organisms upto 9 5 mm of microplastics which might affect the organisms adversely but the stress level is not well known yet research on microplastics in wetlands are at fragile stage which should address the efficient and low investment technique process for monitoring of microplastics quantification abundance and distribution of microplastics in the environment understanding the degradation and fate of plastics and ecological concerns such as interaction with biota and influences on ecosystem services the presence of organic compounds and vegetation cover in wetland also influenced the distribution and deposition of microplastics therefore the fate of microplastics have been gradually grasped in the wetland ecosystems and needs to be further investigated to know the influencing factors for their accumulation in the sediment and suspension with water matrices as wetlands are well known for its immense ecosystem services the accumulation of microplastics in sediments ingestion to biota and involvement in food webs must be investigated for smooth ecosystem services and impact on structure and function of wetlands this analysis will be helpful to policymaker for the use of plastics materials and incorporating better environmental practices therefore the accumulation of microplastic not only in wetland but also to other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is a severe environmental problem which is increasing day by day collective and appropriate research efforts for example surveying monitoring and policy formulations should be developed for a better understanding of the emergent threats to wetland systems through combining various efficient techniques the understanding of the extent of microplastic pollution should be developed to identify the evolving environmental problems and quantification of reliable data set for the environmental impact assessment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgment a grant wac 2018 211 from the australian centre for international agricultural research for supporting this research is acknowledged 
13657,microplastics are the emerging non degradable pollutants in natural ecosystems it impacts humans and wildlife mainly aquatic species by getting incorporated into the food chain due to their sizes 5 mm microplastics are common in the marine ecosystems but are also present in the freshwater ecosystems such as in lakes ponds river basins wetlands or even in moist agricultural lands and groundwater this paper focuses on the primary sources detection and quantification of microplastics in wetlands both freshwater and coastal based on research conducted worldwide fibers thread fragments filaments foams and microbeads are common shapes of microplastics observed in wetland ecosystems microplastics pollution has been observed in wetlands with an abundance of up to 5531 particles m 3 and 6360 particles kg 1 in water and sediment samples respectively this study also discusses the recent progress in extraction characterization and quantification techniques in order to identify research gaps such as the interaction of microplastic and heavy metals and organic compounds in the wetland ecosystem microplastics in size range of 0 12 9 5 mm have been reported in wetland biota furthermore ecological concerns are identified in terms of threats and disturbances caused by microplastics to the freshwater organisms present in wetlands finally it outlines the future scope research gap and potential solutions for microplastic pollution research in wetlands keywords microplastic pollution wetland freshwater coastal density separation 1 background anthropogenic organic and inorganic materials either degradable or non degradable are continuously deposited in the environment these include plastics commonly used as packaging materials because of their strength and lightweight disposed of daily in large quantities across the globe 1 2 the accumulation of plastics on earth is a signature of the anthropocene 3 with microplastics detected in different ecosystems such as freshwater or coastal surface water 4 6 marine environment 7 9 remote mountain catchment 10 sediments 5 11 12 soils 167 13 15 and at high altitude in the atmosphere 16 microplastics such as fibers fragments filaments foams microbeads etc owing to their small particle size 5 mm is now a global concern as an emerging pollutant in the natural ecosystems impacting both aquatic and terrestrial environments 10 17 19 fig 1 generally microplastics result from the degradation of large plastics as primary and secondary microplastics in the environment 17 based on their size lambert et al 20 classified macroplastic as 5 mm mesoplastic as 5 to 1 mm while microplastic and nano plastic are 1 mm to 0 1 μm and 0 1 μm respectively even so the term microplastic is widely accepted for particles less than 5 mm size 21 as a variety of species organisms commonly ingests this size of particulate matter more significantly microplastics are transferred along the food chain creating vulnerabilities for both prey and predator through microplastics bioaccumulation disturbing ecosystem functions i e physiological functions prey predator populations trophic transfers etc 22 freshwater ecosystems provide nature based services including climate regulation and water purification 23 however different levels and forms of microplastics contamination in the freshwater environment threaten freshwater species through metabolism disruption oxidative damages and inflammatory responses dysfunction 24 these also cause long term biological and ecological damage 25 27 threatening species survival via decrease in population triebskorn et al 28 reviewed the environmental consequences such as tissue translocation and toxicity of nano micro plastics due to their accumulation in the human body numerous studies have documented the abundance of microplastics in the marine ecosystem 17 29 30 70 80 of which is estimated to have resulted from effluents discharged from land and rivers 31 microplastics have been observed globally in the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 4 13 32 33 particularly in wastewater and other water bodies 34 however only a few studies focused on the accumulation of microplastics in the freshwater system such as wetlands 35 rivers 36 groundwater 37 estuaries 38 etc although microplastic pollution in the freshwater ecosystems received less attention it has been noticed in the sediments and water samples of rivers lakes ponds wetlands and other surface water bodies 4 8 13 32 33 research in freshwater environments has detected microplastics in many continents such as europe north america africa asia and even antarctica 36 39 44 as microplastics are persistent in terms of their resistance to degrade or transform there are significant ecological concerns particularly concerning their impact on the aquatic flora and fauna 45 46 the primary source of microplastic pollution in inland water bodies is from wastewater treatment plants wwtps industrial effluents agricultural drainage household activities personal care etc 47 49 in addition to wwtps urban runoff also contributes to microplastic pollution in surface waters 50 generally water draining from agricultural fields through irrigation and flooding practices carry microplastics to low lying lands in rural areas therefore surface and sub surface waterbodies are the largest reservoirs for accumulating microplastics 28 51 52 further microplastics in the soil and groundwater ecosystems is a severe form of environmental pollution the richness of microplastics either in marine or in other aquatic ecosystems is a consequence of continuous degradation of large sized plastics into small fractions 47 53 microplastics in the agricultural and other soil surfaces are transported to the surface water and groundwater through runoff and leaching associated with precipitation 8 46 54 interestingly significant microplastic pollution in the aquatic environment is through atmospheric transport 55 56 freshwater is a significant pathway for the transport of microplastics 46 sruthy and ramasamy 57 identified microplastics in vembanad lake kerala a part of the vembanad wetland system near urban settlements the lake receives effluent discharged by rivers and streams and runoff from agriculture and pisciculture movement of microplastics among environmental compartments i e from land ecosystems to aquatic environments is governed by discharge rate and morphological characteristics with their respective residence time 20 58 several studies indicate that microplastics act as transporting agents for pollutants such as heavy and trace metals owing to its high surface volume ratios and chemical structure 59 62 microplastics are also known to transport hydrophobic organic chemicals 63 and antibiotics 64 66 in the aquatic systems organic pollutants 67 persistent bio accumulative and toxic compounds pbts in the soil 68 69 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the subsurface systems 70 microplastics are also known as vectors for transferring toxins from the water to the biota 69 71 72 as well as for waterborne pathogens and exotic species 73 74 the fate and transport of microplastics in freshwater systems are influenced by different properties like flow velocity wind speed and direction and the ecosystem structure 75 76 microplastics also transport micro pollutants and pathogens that are adsorbed onto its surface for example the tris 2 3 dibromopropyl iso cyanurate is transported through microplastic in jiaozhou bay wetland and yellow river delta wetland of china 77 78 the chemical sorption process leads to chemical bonding at polymer surfaces in response to variation in temperature ionic strength and ph of the environment in contrast physical sorption restricts the formation of chemical bonds 79 wetlands provide ecosystem services such as flood control freshwater supply by treating the stormwater maintaining the habitats for diverse plants fish and other organisms many of which provide for human livelihoods in addition to aesthetic and recreational values 80 besides wetlands also act as a reservoir both sink source of microplastics the purpose of this paper therefore is to a review the literature and current state of knowledge regarding the occurrence distribution transfer and fate of microplastics in the wetlands b critically analyze the methods for the extraction of microplastics from water matrix sediments and wetland biota c draw attention to ecological concerns of microplastic pollution d evaluate the interaction of heavy metals and organic compounds with microplastics and e address the existing scientific gaps in current knowledge potential research perspective and recommendations for future studies to understand the microplastic pollution and management in wetland ecosystems 2 primary sources of microplastic in the wetland ecosystems anthropogenic activities encourage microplastic pollution in the wetland ecosystems although wetlands are recognized as natural filters for water purification the primary sources of microplastics in freshwater wetlands are those dumped directly by industries household activities and treatment plants however for coastal wetlands the same sources of microplastics reach through rivers floods and tidal processes fig 2 in this section an intensive review of potential sources of microplastics in freshwater and coastal wetlands has been conducted to provide a better understanding of microplastic contamination in wetlands 2 1 microplastic pollution in freshwater wetlands limited research reported the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystem about 4 as compared with the marine environment 21 81 microplastics in freshwater ecosystems have resulted from the point and non point sources primarily via effluents and sludge 82 for freshwater wetlands microplastic concentrations vary with space and time as reported for river trent and river leen uk 83 and antua river portugal 84 the abundance of microplastics in wetlands depend upon various vital factors such as investigated locations approaches human interference and a natural wetland system 85 besides meng et al 82 reported that flow regimes freshwater topography and extent of biofouling determine the microplastic transport at spatial scales along with anthropogenic activities microplastics were observed in sediments of the yellow river delta shandong china microplastic pollution was observed even in protected areas with no anthropogenic activity suggesting that protected areas might have received microplastics from upstream cities discharge 86 the water and sediments obtained from floating wetlands having stormwater were investigated and microplastics pollution was evident in the form of synthetic rubbers from tire particles in the sediments and water samples 87 the freshwater bodies in urban areas with dense populations have reported high microplastic content 50 85 in urban wetlands microplastic pollution is associated with land use for example greater melbourne australia has 20 urban wetlands which receives effluents from various land uses such as commercial and industrial in addition to household activities 88 similarly microplastic pollution was also reported in the terrestrial wetlands of china s suburban area 89 besides playa wetlands texas showed that surface runoff was contributing microplastics 0 64 mg l 1 to 5 51 mg l 1 in freshwater from personal care stuffs by wastewater pathways and discarded plastics through surface runoff 50 2 2 microplastic pollution in coastal wetlands in addition to freshwater wetlands microplastics have also been reported in coastal wetlands coastal wetlands are prone to microplastic contamination due to extensive anthropogenic pressure such as through sewage inputs and hydrological features such as tides 90 for example sediments from kenilworth park and aquatic gardens the freshwater tidal wetland of washington dc was reported having an abundance of microplastics which had accumulated over a long time 14 microplastics have been extracted from the sediments of inland and freshwater wetlands as well as intertidal or supratidal wetlands plastics and microfibers were obtained in sediments macro invertebrates and shorebirds from intertidal wetlands of west africa and southern europe such as tejo estuary portugal banc d arguin mauritania and bijagos archipelago guinea bissau 90 the qualitative study on the extraction of microplastics on qinzhou bay china having sandy beaches and mangrove wetlands in different hydro geomorphological characteristics of wetlands such as channels and runoffs wetland restoration stabilization ponds sediment loads erosion etc had reported significant microplastics pollution the intertidal beaches with wetlands inside the mangrove have fewer microplastics than supratidal beaches and outside of mangrove wetlands 35 the coastal mangroves encourage microplastics retention from terrestrial as well as marine sources it has been observed that microplastic from foamed stuff accidental leaking defragmented particles from parent materials were found in several coastal wetlands of southeast china 91 the distribution and abundance of microplastic pollution are less explored in mangroves or vegetated wetlands even though vegetated wetlands play a significant role in trapping microplastics for example the sediments from vegetation rich clayey mangroves and salt marsh wetlands reported microplastic pollution 92 94 microplastics obtained from china s coastal wetlands were extracted from soil sediments and analyzed using hyperspectral imaging techniques and other conventional approaches 95 winyah bay the largest freshwater tidal wetland of the usa received effluent drained from power plants industries and agricultural activities where microplastics were extracted from the intertidal sediments 96 most interestingly mangrove restoration promotes microplastics distribution and accumulation in wetlands which raised concern regarding conservation and management in jinjiang estuary fujian china a high concentration of microplastics was found in mangroves after restoration depending upon the plantation pattern p 0 05 mangrove roots as well as dead branches which dominate the microplastics accumulation regions 97 3 extraction and abundance of microplastics in the freshwater and coastal wetlands accumulation of microplastics in the marine environment is common across the globe a few studies have also reported the varying concentration of microplastic pollution in wetland sediments and tissues of living organisms such as their guts digestive tract etc table 1 the separation process was followed by extraction and characterization to determine the extent of microplastic pollution in different wetlands in this section extraction and characterization techniques of microplastics have been discussed by focusing on microplastics in wetlands the abundance and distribution of microplastics in different freshwater i e urban floating and coastal such as vegetated mangrove intertidal supratidal ecosystems have been discussed along with the studies related to laboratory experiments for the widespread overview later abundance and extraction techniques of microplastics have been explored from wetland organisms along with the characterization of extracted microplastics as well 3 1 extraction and characterization techniques of microplastics from water and sediments matrices the extraction of microplastics from aquatic environments depends upon analytical methods for example the density separation and alkali digestion techniques were applied for exploring microplastics from coastal urban and freshwater wetlands numerous studies revealed different extraction techniques for microplastics separation either from sediments or water samples table 1 in general the density of plastics has been found to be 1 02 1 03 g cm 3 110 however microplastics such as polyethylene terephthalate pet nylon and polystyrene ps have a density of 1 37 1 15 and 1 05 g cm 3 respectively 111 112 the microplastics with distinct density have also been observed for other types for example polyethylene 0 89 g cm 3 and polyvinyl chloride 1 38 g cm 3 in the aquatic ecosystem 113 115 in table 1 fibers fragments beads filaments and foams are sorted microplastics observed through density separation 88 89 98 a few studies conducted globally for microplastic pollution in sediments of the different freshwater ecosystems such as lake huron canada usa rivers elique lake geneva switzerland france maipo chile lake garda italy saint lawrence river canada and river ganga india 36 116 120 121 123 for each ecosystem the density separation was conducted for the extraction of microplastics using different salt solutions such as sodium chloride nacl zinc chloride zncl2 seawater etc the salt solutions such as calcium chloride 1 30 1 35 g cm 3 sodium chloride 1 2 g cm 3 sodium polytungstate 1 4 g cm 3 sodium iodide 1 6 g cm 3 and zinc chloride 1 5 1 7 g cm 3 had been incorporated for density separation 30 124 in previous density separation studies zinc chloride was applied for density difference in the solution for microplastics extraction however zinc chloride has been reported as a hazardous solution as compared to sodium chloride or iodide 114 125 126 therefore the environment friendly and non explosive salt solution such as sodium chloride has been preferred widely for extracting microplastics through the density separation method consequently hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been applied for chemical destruction to remove undesired or interfering substances 94 96 generally for quantification and identification of microplastics the micro fourier transform infrared μ ftir spectroscopy has been utilized through the identification of its polymeric properties in wetlands different polymers such as polystyrene polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyvinyl chloride polyamide and acrylic have been observed during microplastics extraction through density separation table 1 87 94 96 besides the evidence of polyamide microplastics investigated using ftir is observed from nylon materials cloths and fishing nets as a potential source in setiu wetland malaysia 98 in ftir analysis the polymeric characterization of microplastics depicted nh amine c h aliphatic and cn amide stretching vibration which emphasized the presence of microplastic residues of nylon materials cloths and fishing nets 98 3 2 microplastics abundance and distribution in freshwater wetlands nowadays microplastics are getting transferred into various aquatic ecosystems from marine to freshwater ecosystems microplastics having particle size 300 μm were found significantly in suburban wetlands of china 89 in that sediment samples were investigated from 20 independent urban wetlands 2 cm deep for both the natural and constructed wetland of melbourne australia the sediment samples were compared using two different density solutions i e sodium chloride and zinc chloride but zinc chloride showed high removal efficiency 60 100 than sodium chloride 10 80 and depicted that the samples were dominantly containing fragments followed by fibers and beads the statistical correlations were applied to understand the relation of microplastics abundance for catchment size and land use type separately using spearman rank smirnov correlations therefore it has been stated that no significant correlations exist between abundance with catchment size spearman rank correlation ρ 0 25 0 33 p 0 05 n 20 for major land use types like negatively correlated for open spaces ρ 0 79 p 0 001 n 20 but positively correlated for industrial area ρ 0 61 p 0 004 n 20 another study concluded that land use such as commercial residential industrial open space etc and catchment activities were contributing to microplastic pollution because of plastic litter degradation and industrial activity 88 as evidence of synthesized microplastics are unknown from tire particles samples of sediments and water collected from a floating treatment freshwater wetland gold coast australia were first digested and undergone density separation using sodium iodide solution for microplastic extraction it was reported that floating wetlands were highly contaminated with tire particles 595 120 and 320 42 particles kg 1 of dry sediment at inlet and outlet respectively 87 therefore the fate and transport of synthetic microplastics need to be investigated in wetlands so that the floating treatment wetlands can control microplastic pollution to surface water bodies 3 3 abundance and distribution of microplastics in coastal mangroves mangroves have been reported as the significant reservoir of the microplastic the mangroves as well as salty marsh characteristics and habitats contain a high quantity of microplastics because of the retaining or trapping of plastics microplastics in the vegetation as shown in fig 3 35 92 93 the association between microplastic pollution and vegetation density is poorly investigated yet for vegetated wetlands the inner zone and adjacent coastlines of intertidal wetlands are generally covered with mangroves which dominated the retention of microplastic besides it accelerates the degradation of plastics under the effect of eternal force such as ultraviolet light and high temperature 127 therein the styrofoam waste fragmented into microplastic particles get transported to the coastal wetlands under the eternal force 53 consequently helcoski et al 14 reported that microplastics transport get reduced with vegetation the emerging wetland plants are an effective filter for microplastic the evidence of microfiber accumulation is significantly high 1270 150 items kg 1 in mudflat dense vegetation as well as in drift line habitats qinzhou bay have both mangrove wetland and sandy beaches extracted microplastics using density separation using calcium chloride cacl2 solution and detected microplastic concentrated abundantly on supratidal and outside of mangrove coefficient of variation 1 01 depicting significant variability in the abundance of microplastics whereas in the case of intertidal beaches and inner part of mangrove of the bay it was found to be less concentrated with microplastic coefficient of variation 0 62 the average abundance of microplastic outside the mangrove 2174 items kg 1 was a severe environmental problem than inner mangrove 43 items kg 1 investigated by one way anova p 0 05 statistically polystyrene was found as a significant contributor to microplastic pollution in qinzhou bay 98 35 similarly the intertidal sediments were analyzed from the top 2 cm of winyah bay the eastern coast of usa and the sediments from bay were investigated using sodium chloride solution followed by 30 of h2o2 for removal of organic material it was found that the intertidal sediments contain microplastic particles having a concentration of 221 26 particles m 2 with particle size 63 μm the statistical kruskal wallis non parametric test was applied to observe a significant difference in abundance concerning the sites however no significant difference has been found between concentrations with each sampling site of the bay for intertidal sediments χ2 1 3 df 3 p 0 74 96 furthermore the average concentration of microplastic was observed as 253 26 particles m 2 in vembanad lake in the brackish wetland of india using density separation with sodium chloride solution 57 3 4 evidence of microplastic pollution in coastal wetlands the accumulation of microplastics in urban wetlands have major ecological benefits as it protects the aquatic ecological unit from stormwater pollution furthermore several aquatic and terrestrial species are dependent on urban wetlands as habitats 128 whereas the coastal wetland provides an enormous ecological and economic values for livelihood like aquaculture farming fisheries tourism aesthetic and recreational activities 129 130 which promotes the abundance of microplastics in wetlands therefore studies conducted in wetlands near the populated area recreational sites or industrial activities depicted microplastic pollution 88 similarly the yellow river delta wetland had shown microplastic pollution due to human activities not only at the tourism sites and harbors but also at the protected area having no human activities with an average amount of 136 2060 items kg 1 as compared with no human actions in the protected area mean 1200 items kg 1 the harbor site marked a high concentration of microplastic mean 2060 items kg 1 86 therein zhou et al 91 stated that the sediments collected from 21 sites of mangrove wetland southcoast china was analyzed under sodium chloride solution to extract microplastic followed by stereomicroscope and ftir analysis for size analysis and polymeric characterization the shapes of obtained microplastic such as foams fibers films fragments and pellets are varied because of exposition to various pollution sources fig 4 a the extracted sample of microplastics was identified as polystyrene polypropylene rayon polyester polyethylene and acrylic ranging from 8 3 to 5738 3 items kg 1 of dry sediment fig 4b besides vegetal litter has been identified as a driving factor for microplastic pollution therefore the vegetal litter sediment samples were collected from the top 10 cm depth at the mature mangrove forest of guangdong china here a high density solution of zinc chloride 1 5 g m 3 was utilized for separation of microplastics from vegetal litter followed by digestion using 30 of h2o2 resulting into the identification of various types of polymers for example polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate polyamide polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene 94 looking for evidence of microplastics in the food web it has also been described that the high abundance of microplastics was recorded in sediments 91 followed by macro invertebrates 60 and secondary consumers shorebirds 49 confirming the transfer of microplastic into food webs at tejo estuary banc d arguin and bijagos archipelago almost 99 8 of the total investigated samples were microfibers with an average length of 2 37 2 27 mm on the other hand the concentration of microfibers has a significant difference in the sediments of these three wetlands kruskal wallis test z 19 3 p 0 001 as the 61 of microfibers were found in macro invertebrates the concentration and frequency of microfiber s contamination were reported the highest in tejo estuary χ2 23 9 p 0 001 and mann whitney test z 2 65 p 0 01 respectively in the context of microplastic abundance among different individual species the tejo estuary has statistically significant difference among various species f 3 51 p 0 01 f 0 77 p 0 2 for foraging strategies whereas the bijagos archipelago influenced microfibers concentration and banc d arguin has not been reported any significant relationship with microfibers contamination therefore the two factors were possibly influenced the microfibers contamination in tejo estuary i e fine sediments β 0 36 0 11 f 10 62 p 0 01 and population density in local township β 0 37 0 11 f 11 52 p 0 01 apart from these microfiber contamination in the intertidal wetland of tejo estuary was subjected to be influenced by sediment s grain size and human settlements in the locality 90 additionally in the mangrove restoration process it has been observed that the microplastics get accumulated in mangrove wetland after restoration depending upon the planting pattern and density mangrove roots and dead plants and branches therefore a high concentration of microplastics was observed in jinjiang estuary china after the restoration under different planting patterns which also promoted the accumulation of different heavy metals onto their surface in that study microplastics 0 038 1 mm with a concentration of 980 127 2340 99 items per kg of dry sediments were observed in mangrove restoration regions which is significantly high in abundance than the mudflats regions but the controlled non planting regions have fewer microplastics than restored regions with different planting density p 0 05 97 on the other hand modern technology like the hyperspectral imaging techniques displayed potential to detect microplastic abundance from coastal wetlands of china together with the density separation method the soil sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm layer for the microplastic extraction and identification the extracted microplastics were colored white and black polyethylene confirmed by raman spectrometer with particles of 0 5 5 mm size range in the hyperspectral imaging method for extraction of microplastics such as maximum likelihood mahalanobis distance and support vector machine all three supervised classifications were applied to identify microplastic in soil sediments with the co existence of other stuff out of these three supervised classifications the support vector machine had performed best in identifying white polyethylene having a precision of 84 and 94 recall in contrast for black polyethylene it had 58 precision and 92 recall in the context of the particle size range the obtained polyethylene was 9 100 and 86 99 for 1 5 mm and 0 5 1 mm respectively 95 microplastics accumulation in sediments is common across the globe besides microplastics accumulation has been explored in coastal biota for example microplastics were found in gills intestine and stomach of fishes from zhanjiang mangrove wetland south china 106 in the caspian sea northern iran rasta et al 108 observed a high concentration of microplastics in sediments 3690 items per kg than surface water 4 41 items per cubic meter in the anzali coastal wetland most interestingly anthropogenic activities have been observed that the anzali wetland is a reservoir of microplastics and import towards the caspian sea as a result they affect both wetland organisms and marine biota however transport of microplastics from anzali wetlands needs to be investigated further along the pathways and interaction mechanisms of micro pollutants such as plastics and heavy metals into wetlands and marine biota 4 interaction of microplastics with heavy metals and organic compounds several studies highlight the adsorption of heavy metals onto microplastics due to high surface volume ratio of microplastic particles which led to the transport of heavy metals to the wetland ecosystems 59 62 surface modifications such as adherence avulsions flakes fractures and pits increases the surface area of microplastics which promotes the adsorption of pollutants onto surfaces and allows the transport of heavy metals in the environment 59 97 several studies have been conducted for investigating microplastics interaction with heavy metals in different ecosystems 59 131 133 for a better understanding of microplastic interaction with heavy metals scanning electron microscopy sem equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis were incorporated for surface characterization and heavy metals mapping deng et al 97 stated that mechanical erosion and chemical weathering have been observed on microplastic surfaces using sem eds images and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analysis and depicted the accumulation of chromium cr zinc zn lead pb cadmium cd nickel ni arsenic as copper cu and mercury hg on the microplastic surfaces sem images depicted the mechanical erosion of microplastics such as pits flakes fractures avulsions and adherence however eds illustrated the heavy metals content in the order of zn pb cu cr ni as cd hg the concentration of heavy metal on microplastics was statistically correlated with wetland sediments for hg but it was not correlated for as cr cu cd ni and zn p 0 05 cd and zn concentrations were found to be high onto microplastics surfaces than sediments whereas hg concentration indicated relatively higher in the sediments than the microplastic surfaces besides this microplastics in the yellow river delta have been statistically correlated with the heavy metals using cluster analysis it has been observed that both microplastics and heavy metals are from separate sources therefore no correlation has been found for microplastics and hg however the significant correlation between cd and polyethylene terephthalate recommended a similar source for microplastic and heavy metals in the study 86 several studies illustrated the interaction of organic compounds for instance free particulate and occulated particulate organic matter 134 persistent organic pollutants 135 organic carbon 136 humus and fulvic acid 137 with microplastics in the wetland ecosystem therein the fate of microplastics are predominantly determined by the presence of soil organic carbon in terms of soil aggregation and stability 168 134 138 ren et al 139 showed a positive correlation of microplastics particles size with soil organic carbon and can potentially impact the biogeochemical cycle in the wetlands besides li et al 136 also observed a positive relationship between soil organic carbon content with an abundance of microplastics in sediments of mangrove wetland as a result the stability of microplastics in terms of deposition are enhanced with high organic carbon content and a minimal integration of organic compounds with microplastics in the sediments are not much more significant 140 5 ingestion of microplastics by wetland organisms microplastics accumulation is becoming an ecological concern to aquatic biota not only due to their long persistence 57 but the aquatic microorganisms are likely to digest ingest pollutants the plastics of smaller sizes 5 mm are found as hazardous debris to organisms in aquatic or marine ecosystems few studies stated that the abundance of microplastic in the wetland ecosystem threatened organisms 24 102 microplastics have been found in tissues guts and other parts of aquatic animals such as from the gills intestine and stomach of fishes microplastics are reportedly getting acclimatize into the food web through prey to predator after ingestion research related to freshwater biota recorded evidence of microplastics found in sediments that get transferred into key species in the ecosystems through the food chain to food web 141 thus despite having various studies on microplastic pollution in the marine ecosystem very few literatures are primarily focused on ingestion by birds 24 and wild fishes 142 in freshwater primarily microplastics have also been extracted from different fish species 102 106 faecal matters and feathers 24 in that microplastic pollution studies depicted burden on the freshwater species through microplastic ingestion in fishes however the ecological concern is less understood 143 145 likewise microplastics have also been extracted from different species of fish in zhanjiang mangrove wetland south china microplastics have been quantified from the gills intestine and stomach of fish species the mean count of microplastic in mangrove fish was found to be 2 8 1 8 items individual 1 positively correlated with body length weight of fish 106 apart from this microplastic pollution was bio monitored in urban wetlands of australia through the fish gambusia holbrooki the urban wetlands are receiving microplastic from anthropogenic sources 85 104 not only from sediments of urban wetlands but also fish species such as gambusia holbrooki from nine urban wetlands of australia has been investigated to extract microplastics from their body about 0 6 microplastic item per individual and head about 0 1 microplastic item per individual to establish the correlation between microplastic uptake in different organs such as head and body 104 though ibrahim et al 98 extracted microplastic from the shell of keystone species bivalve scapharca cornea at setiu wetland malaysia later on microplastics were extracted from cage cultured asian sea bass lates calcarifer from setiu wetland malaysia and were characterized 100 similar to this in kendall frost mission bay salt marsh california the wetland fishes such as fundulus parvipinnis mugil cephalus and gillichthys mirabilis were feeding anthropogenic debris extracted from the guts of fishes 102 also the relationship between microplastic uptake with fish size and weight has been established to distinguish the microplastic pollution in the urban wetlands of australia along with microplastic count the morphological shape of microplastic helps to determine the potential sources and contamination of freshwater and marine ecosystems there is limited research on the prevalence of microplastic contamination on freshwater species for example the feces and feather brushings of african duck species were investigated from birds and biodiversity areas of contaminated wetlands strandfontein and barberspan site of south africa the african freshwater ecosystem comes under threat due to heavy contamination received from sewage treatment plants in those studies the collected samples were cleaned with distilled water and residues were analyzed using the binocular microscope which contained flexible fibers 5 mm after that the general linear model glm was applied to explore the abundance of microplastic pollution with sampling location as well as bird species the glm demonstrated that the strandfontein site has high presence χ2 4 70 df 1 p 0 03 and abundance χ2 4 86 df 1 p 0 03 of fiber microplastic in feather brushing whereas no significant difference has been found between bird species with respect to feather samples χ2 1 81 df 1 p 0 61 just an opposite correlations were observed for faecal samples the fiber abundance has been found significantly different with bird species χ2 13 88 df 4 p 0 008 whereas no significant difference was reported for presence χ2 0 46 df 1 p 0 50 and abundance χ2 0 60 df 1 p 0 44 with respect to sampling locations 24 therein the results strongly demonstrated the fiber ingestion by freshwater ducks in south africa which was similar for microplastics found in the digestive tract of 14 ducks in canada 146 and from the lakes of central spain with 44 45 of shelduck feces plastics debris 147 6 microplastics extraction technique and its characterization from wetland biota microplastics accumulation in sediments and organisms have been investigated significantly though researchers have incorporated different techniques for microplastics extraction and their characterization for polymeric identifications consequently literature available on the biological impact of microplastics on freshwater taxa having toxicological effects are less investigated however the gut content in freshwater fishes was generally quantified for microplastic pollution analysis 148 microplastics extraction from the guts shells gastrointestinal tract etc of wetland biota using alkali digestion method has been summarized in table 1 in setiu wetland of malaysia scapharca cornea ingested microplastics sampled in their shell in that study microplastic was extracted from the shell using alkali digestion technique where tissues were observed under 10 m sodium hydroxide naoh at 60 c for 24 h followed by oven drying at the same temperature for 3 h to determine the digestion efficiency in the extracted samples the majority of microplastic particles were filaments 0 12 9 5 mm of blue black brown green grey purple orange red white and transparent color as mentioned in section 3 1 the polymeric identification and characterization were carried out using ftir analysis by associated functional groups over microplastic samples ftir analysis was conducted for polymeric identification of extracted microplastic samples which detected nh amine c h aliphatic and cn amide stretching vibration i e polyethylene and polyamide nature of microplastic in the dried tissue samples the presence of polyamides is depicting microplastic residue from nylon materials cloths and fishing nets in abundance in that the abundance of microplastic in s cornea was reported significantly high which reflects the contamination level in situ 98 the alkali digestion method using 10 m naoh was adopted for extraction of microplastic from the gastrointestinal tract of lates calcarifer followed by the water bath at 60 c the ftir analysis highlighted the presence of alkyl and polyvinyl alcohol chains in microplastic samples in the range of 4 3 15 7 μm size wild fish and cage cultured fish were spatially investigated which presents the high abundance of microplastic in wild fish though the abundance of both fishes reported statistically different 0 05 100 the foraging strategy assessment predicted the accumulation of microplastic by the organisms such as fundulus parvipinnis mugil cephalus and gillichthys mirabilis feed by benthos and water column benthic detritus and invertebrates and small fishes from mud respectively sampled at kendall frost mission bay reserve california as a result guts content has been analyzed from the foraging strategies of consumers to quantify microplastics consumption numerically the gut content was analyzed using the microscope with 10 koh solution based on feeding strategies it has been found that microplastics were consumed by f parvipinnis 28 4 and m cephalus 5 7 in their guts however no evidence of microplastic was found in g mirabillis it also suggested that the anthropogenic debris logged microplastics in wetland fishes as the consumption of anthropogenic debris reported to be a significantly affected species χ2 63 093 df 1 p 0 1 102 most interestingly freshwater bodies are densely polluted with microplastic though the freshwater bodies at remote locations noted a high concentration of microplastics with a low population residing nearby the industrialized area 85 149 7 ecological concern of microplastic pollution in wetlands wetland provides huge ecosystem services to the society though in return accumulation of microplastics disturb its natural services microplastic pollution has the potential to damage and exacerbates the functioning of wetland ecosystem though microplastic accumulation in wetlands is an ecological concern the accumulation of plastics from anthropogenic debris in wetlands is responsible for loss in habitats and a suitable path for accumulation in the food web 102 microplastic pollution made an adverse effect on the marine biota on the other hand in the case of wetland ecosystem the impacts on biota are likely to be unknown 88 only a few studies have investigated microplastics in wetlands biota therein the accumulated microplastic may result in the digestive tract enzyme production obstructive nutrient depletion reduced feeding stimulus and low growth rates in aquatic species 150 the accumulation of microplastics is reported to get transferred in the food web from plankton to large fish 90 151 153 and alteration in their habitats especially in coral reefs 154 microplastics not only affect prey but also to the predator which gets transferred into the food chain 22 the evidence of microplastic contamination to secondary consumers like birds are indicating a serious concern for accessibility of microplastic not only in sediments and groundwater but also to species having trophic links including human beings 90 the microplastic accumulation in organisms has been reported in the number of literature however stress on the organism are unknown yet ustabasi and baysal 155 examined the growth inhibition stress on bacillus subtilis 20 30 inhibition and pseudomonas aeruginosa 20 35 inhibition affected by microplastic under the influence of standard laboratory and seawater conditions respectively as both bacteria has shown significant microplastics surface charge differences between cell walls and microplastic surfaces due to significant inhibition and dose the environmental impacts of microplastics have been categorized into physical biological and chemical disturbances to the environment 156 physical disturbance through entanglement and ingestion of microplastics can cause suffocation and starvation to the organisms 7 157 microplastic pollution was investigated in the freshwater ecosystem to determine the ecological risk to freshwater fauna and accompanying natural processes in north africa and tunisia 158 chemical and biological threats come into existence to aquatic animals organisms and human beings through various pathways and mechanisms after being adsorbed inside the aquatic and human bodies 156 besides this it is necessary to investigate the relationship between microplastics with micro macro pollutants significantly impacting on the freshwater species 8 in general freshwater ecosystems mainly possess different characteristics in terms of salinity debris contaminants etc than marine systems 8 future scope and research gap for microplastic pollution in wetland ecosystem research domain on microplastic is interdisciplinary in which it covers oceanography hydrology chemistry toxicology etc although extensive research was conducted on the marine system but least investigation on the extraction quantification and identification of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystems have been reported in the freshwater system only a few research on the monitoring of microplastics in lakes rivers wetlands estuaries are available yet 50 87 159 160 wagner et al 161 stated that immense knowledge gaps exist for the extraction of microplastics from freshwater ecosystems than marine because of their abundance biological effects and chemical exposure potential in long term studies research progress on wetlands have been compared with other ecosystems and depicts certain limitations and shortcomings related to microplastics pollution research in the wetlands such as sources and pathways sampling approaches adsorption mechanisms of contaminants and ecological risk and management and policy intervention degree of surface water pollution with microplastics is unavailable and very limited in wetlands so it can be projected for interpretation and understanding the presence of microplastics and their influence on the freshwater ecosystems consecutively the appropriate modelling process is required to investigate and understand the critical source as well as the environmental fate and transport of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystems explaining the sources for microplastic pollution and their pathways in freshwater ecosystems are a challenging task for forthcoming researchers 8 a limited amount of microplastics have been found in terrestrial and coastal wetlands which needs to be expanded in other diversified wetlands such as meadows seasonal lake wetlands karst ecosystem and constructed wetlands in the current state of knowledge different counting units have been reported i e items or particles per units of area volume weight and so on the standard and efficient protocol should be developed for quantification and identification of microplastic pollution from the complex wetland ecosystem therefore the efficient and eco friendly methodology must also be opted for maximum microplastics extraction from the soil sediments without introducing any substantial pollution helcoski et al 14 identified vegetation as a natural filter which removes microplastics significantly not only the natural wetlands but also the constructed wetlands have also been identified as the potential filter which removes suspended solid particles 90 97 from the water column 162 therefore the incorporation of vegetation in the constructed wetlands can potentially remove microplastics besides ziajahromi et al 87 recommended for investigating the old treated wetlands to comprehend potential microplastic pollution from the floating method of wetland treatment suitable quantitative and monitoring approaches should be adopted which can identify types of microplastic to recognize the potential source of plastics along with primary and secondary sources 50 the soil physical properties are noticed to be altered due to microplastic pollution in the terrestrial ecosystem 163 however the sediments in freshwater ecosystems is still not investigated microplastics are reported as a vector for toxic compounds chemicals contaminants in the aquatic system i e the toxic effect of microplastics need to be investigated in freshwater systems 140 hydrophobic pollutants likely get adsorbed on the microplastic surfaces however the extent of sorption has not been evaluated under various environmental states e g varying ionic strength ph and temperature for that reason the adsorption desorption mechanism of toxic chemicals on microplastics at in situ conditions need to be considered in prospective studies for the wetland ecosystem the emerging concerns for building hotspots in wetland favor the microplastics accumulation however the concerns for the transport of microplastic in wetland ecosystems are still unknown microplastics also act as a carrier of other toxic contaminants in the natural environment though the ingestion of those impact on aquatic organisms is unknown poor understanding of the accumulation of microplastics in the food web was also highlighted in wetlands through this review therefore the accumulation of microplastics in the food web needs to get instantaneous attention to explore the potential impact on aquatic organisms in wetlands recently few experiments were conducted for microplastic exposure to organisms 148 161 164 165 therefore it is necessary to understand and monitor the ecological risks on the freshwater and marine biota as they consume microplastics silva cavalcanti et al 148 suggested that microplastics pollution are reported to be vulnerable for freshwater organisms in an aquatic ecosystem therefore the vulnerability assessment is further needed to be investigated due to microplastics ingestion and risk posed to human beings as well the vulnerability of predators is likely in more danger than prey due to microplastic pollution exposure prey predator vulnerability analysis will reveal the ecological effects of microplastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems 22 most importantly the life stages of biota should be deliberated during the formulation of experiments to access ecological risks 104 the ecotoxicological assessment studies need to be developed for determining the microplastics exposure to wetland biota which led to exploring the probability assessment in terms of subsistence growth and death changes in organisms at the ecosystem level in freshwater systems 165 in general the ecological impacts of microplastic pollution in both freshwater and coastal wetlands are still unexplored which needs to be further investigated to determine the associated consequences on wetlands and biota wetlands manager must maintain and conserve from not becoming the wetland as the significant source of microplastic pollution 88 however a new mechanism has been developed that ecological engineers are identified as a microplastics fixer in the freshwater ecosystem 166 which can also be incorporated in investigating microplastics pollution in wetland ecosystems like marine microplastic pollution policy initiatives must be developed for understanding the abundance and impact on freshwater organisms and further reducing the microplastics count in the environment 54 lasee et al 50 suggested an additional and efficient monitoring of aquatic environments for determining secondary microplastic pollution 9 conclusions microplastics in wetlands are mainly originating from anthropogenic activities for example agriculture industries and households which became a global concern due to their shapes and small sizes these particles were noted from sediments water and aquatic animals of the wetland globally in this paper the sources uptake and distribution of microplastics have been considered and summarized that the inputs of microplastics in wetlands are related to human activities numerous statistical models have a significant correlation with their abundance concerning location species and kind of microplastic in major wetland studies the extraction of microplastic from sediments and water was carried out using a density separation technique studies have summarized that fibers threads fragments films filaments foams and microbeads are common shapes which exist in water matrices sediments and wetland biota the common polymeric types of microplastics in wetlands are polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene besides it has been perceived that the microplastic get bio accumulated in aquatic organisms upto 9 5 mm of microplastics which might affect the organisms adversely but the stress level is not well known yet research on microplastics in wetlands are at fragile stage which should address the efficient and low investment technique process for monitoring of microplastics quantification abundance and distribution of microplastics in the environment understanding the degradation and fate of plastics and ecological concerns such as interaction with biota and influences on ecosystem services the presence of organic compounds and vegetation cover in wetland also influenced the distribution and deposition of microplastics therefore the fate of microplastics have been gradually grasped in the wetland ecosystems and needs to be further investigated to know the influencing factors for their accumulation in the sediment and suspension with water matrices as wetlands are well known for its immense ecosystem services the accumulation of microplastics in sediments ingestion to biota and involvement in food webs must be investigated for smooth ecosystem services and impact on structure and function of wetlands this analysis will be helpful to policymaker for the use of plastics materials and incorporating better environmental practices therefore the accumulation of microplastic not only in wetland but also to other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is a severe environmental problem which is increasing day by day collective and appropriate research efforts for example surveying monitoring and policy formulations should be developed for a better understanding of the emergent threats to wetland systems through combining various efficient techniques the understanding of the extent of microplastic pollution should be developed to identify the evolving environmental problems and quantification of reliable data set for the environmental impact assessment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of

13658,in this study sand enriched with graphene oxide go was applied as the medium to prevent heavy metals migration to groundwater the retention of heavy metals including cr vi as iii cd ii and pb ii in the prepared medium was investigated batch experiments results revealed that the adsorption capacities of go were 530 85 170 1 49 78 and 14 41 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi the adsorption characteristics of go were investigated by four linear and nonlinear isotherm models nonlinear freundlich was the best model fitting the experimental observations in equilibrium reactions the presence of go enhanced adsorption capacity of the sand column to 92 87 88 and 94 for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi respectively the retention of single component and a mixture of heavy metals in the prepared medium was studied showing that in the mixture of metals the adsorption capacity of go reduced by 14 21 and 39 for pb ii cd ii and as iii respectively a longer breakthrough time for go was achieved for pb ii 10 83 h and cd ii 4 23 h indicating higher efficiency of the reactive medium in the retention of pb ii and cd ii thomas and adam s bohart kinetic models were applied to express the dynamic characteristics of the proposed medium breakthrough curves of cr vi cd ii and pb ii were successfully predicted by thomas model while that of as iii was described better by adam s bohart model this can be associated with the fact that the thomas model assumes langmuir isotherm while adsorption behavior of as iii was well depicted by freundlich isotherm keywords graphene oxide heavy metals adsorption modeling fixed bed column groundwater porous media 1 introduction over several centuries a growing number of hazardous chemicals release to receiving waters and direct their way deliberately or accidentally into the groundwater resources heavy metals enter into groundwater from different sources including leachate from mine tailings and landfills discharge of domestic and specifically industrial effluents metal contamination is considered to be one of the most hazardous pollutants because of their possible risk to water resources and concomitant threats to human health 1 2 in addition heavy metals are highly toxic persistent non biodegradable and infamous for their carcinogenic impacts on living organisms their bioaccumulation in living tissues may endanger ecological systems and can be absorbed into the living organisms via the food chain 3 5 heavy metal diffusion and mobility through soil layers are contingent upon the changes in soil ph redox potential and also metal complexation with other dissolved elements 6 7 the occurrence of heavy metals in the subsurface system is a significant problem endangering ecological systems 7 8 therefore soil contamination in the unsaturated or vadose zone has gained more attention because it can impose threats to water supply due to the mobilization and transport processes of contaminants 9 therefore elimination and immobilization of heavy metals prior to reaching the groundwater system is necessary and a critical challenge in the perspective of environment and health on the other hand it is essential to find innovative and effective remedial techniques for heavy metal contaminated groundwater and soil on the whole the technologies applied for controlling the discharge of heavy metal into the groundwater can be categorized into three main groups i physico chemical ii chemical iii biological biochemical biosorption several in situ technologies such as permeable reactive barriers reduction biosorption biorestoration chemical flushing electrokinetic treatment and adsorption have been used to restrict heavy metal release to groundwater however adsorption is a physicochemical treatment technology that is mainly used to immobilize contaminants and mitigate their migration to the environment 6 10 this method was found to be a feasible and cost effective approach which can be extensively used in different remediation practices 11 a variety of materials have been tested as adsorbents such as zeolite montmorillonite kaolinite zero valent iron activated carbon and carbon nanotubes cnts among which carbon materials have been used increasingly because of their excellent chemical stability and high adsorption capacity 12 13 graphene oxide go the oxidation product of graphene regarded as next generation material has emerged as a novel adsorbent for removing contaminants including inorganic and organic pollutants particularly heavy metals 13 14 it has attracted tremendous attention because of its remarkable properties such as excellent electrical and thermal conductivity high specific surface area 2620 m2 g 16 it is one of the carbon based nanomaterials with a unique structure containing hydroxyl epoxy carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups high sorption performance of go toward metal ions is attributed to its specific physicochemical properties and the higher electronegativity of oxygen over carbon atoms 17 18 therefore electrostatic attraction surface complexation and ion exchange are considered principal mechanisms for immobilization of metal ions 19 recently several studies have been conducted on the sorption ability of go toward heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions such as pb ii cd ii co ii cr cu ii and eu iii 20 21 modified graphene oxide was also used for water purification and removal of as iii cd ii and cr vi 1 22 23 according to the investigations the adsorption of heavy metals on go is dependent on contact time the initial metal ion concentration ph sorbent dose and temperature but independent on the ionic strength 24 to the best of our knowledge however few studies were devoted to the investigation of the sorption of multicomponent metal ions on go in aqueous solutions 25 26 sitko et al evaluated the competition for sorption between heavy metals including cu ii cd ii zn ii and pb ii on go in aqueous solutions the results indicated that adsorption capacities were in the order of pb ii cu ii cd ii zn ii 25 in recent studies the application of go as a reactive adsorbent in fixed bed columns has grown significantly due to the high mobility of go a material like sand is required as a support to immobilize go and also enhance the go surface area gong et al investigated the adsorption of pb ii and methylene blue in the ﬁxed bed column filled with go coated sand and yoon nelson model was used for prediction of the breakthrough curves it was concluded that the adsorption capacity of the column increased greatly by go 27 ding et al found that go could be used as in sand columns as a layer to remove heavy metals including pb ii and cu ii from aqueous solutions the removal efficiency was improved by increasing the amount of go in the column on the contrary a rise in the flow rate led to lower heavy metal sorption in gong et al study the transport of contaminants was simulated by the convection dispersion reaction model but the adsorption performance of adsorbent was not considered 26 however the role of the mixture of go sand filter in column tests simultaneous removal of heavy metals and their competitive interactions were not addressed in these studies specifically the kinetic models and dynamic equilibrium for target contaminants in the mixed condition have not been extensively characterized in this fixed bed system this study is an attempt to investigate the efficacy of go as an adsorbent for heavy metal immobilization and its role in creating the reactive zone in porous media firstly the batch experiments were conducted to examine the adsorbent performance in the removal of four heavy metals pb ii cd ii cr vi and as iii and the results were modeled by langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherms the second objective of this study was to investigate the retention of target contaminants in go sand medium in single and mixed sorbate solutions moreover due to the importance of the time and appearance of the breakthrough curve for determining the transport of contaminants and the dynamic response of an adsorption column design and prediction of the concentration time profile for the effluents were done by kinetic models adam s bohart and thomas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals graphene oxide was synthesized from puriﬁed natural graphite according to the modified hummer s method 28 sand standard sand silica co with a particle size of 300 420 μm was used the sand was washed with tap water nitric acid 10 v v and deionized di water sequentially to remove metal oxides according to the cleaning procedure reported by tian et al 29 cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate cd no3 2 4h2o sodium arsenite naaso2 potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 and lead nitrate pb no3 2 were purchased from merck company darmstadt germany and used to prepare the stock solutions of heavy metal the initial ph values of solutions were adjusted by using 0 1 mol l 1 of nitric acid and sodium hydroxide all reagents except those used for go preparation were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 characterization of adsorbent the morphology and size of go were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem model hitachi s 4160 japan and transmission electron microscopy tem zeiss em900 germany with an accelerating voltage of 200 kv raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the go raman spectra were recorded with a raman spectrometer senterra bruker germany with a laser excitation wavelength of 785 nm surface functional groups were characterized through fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer bruker tensor 27 germany moreover high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem tescan mira3 czech was employed to analyze the structure of go enabled sand and acid washed sand particles for measuring the size of the go nanoparticles the dynamic light scattering dls method was employed malvern nano s the total cr concentration was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 730oes varian and the concentration of cr iii ions was calculated from the difference between the total cr and cr vi concentrations 2 3 batch adsorption experiments to describe the adsorption equilibrium characteristics batch adsorption studies were employed adsorption isotherms were obtained using solutions in which the concentration of single metal ions was in the range of 5 60 mg l 1 and the go concentration was kept constant at first 30 mg of go was added to 25 ml of di water and was dispersed thoroughly by ultrasonication for 15 min then metal ion solution was added and volumes were adjusted to 50 ml thereby preparing the sample solutions with the final concentrations of 5 10 20 30 40 60 mg l 1 the ph of solutions was adjusted to 6 by 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and naoh after that the metal solutions were added to the go and stirred for one hour at room temperature ph value of 6 was chosen because the normal ph of the groundwater system is between 6 8 5 also the higher stability of the solution of go and metal ions without precipitation was achieved in ph 6 contact time of one hour was chosen based on the preliminary experiment on the effect of time on the adsorption capacity fig s1 then the resulting mixtures were centrifuged 7000 rpm for 30 min inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 730oes varian was applied to determine the metal ion concentration in the solutions the sorption quantity and removal efficiency of adsorbent were calculated according to the following equations 1 re m o v a l c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e v m where qe mg g 1 is sorption quantity c o and c e mg l 1 are the initial and residual concentrations of the adsorbate respectively v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of adsorbent 2 4 adsorption isotherm models the adsorption isotherm is a curve that is used for describing the adsorption performance a wide variety of equilibrium isotherm models have been developed for investigation of adsorbent behavior and obtaining adsorption parameters 30 in the present study langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherms were employed to model the experimental datasets the nonlinear and linearized forms of the proposed isotherm models are presented in table 1 based on langmuir adsorption isotherm the adsorbed layer is one molecule in thickness in this model the adsorption is homogenous and active sites are identical with equal sorption activation energy 31 adsorption nature can be evaluated by a separation factor rl constant deﬁned by webber and chakkravorti 32 it is computed by the following equation 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where kl l mg is the langmuir constant and c0 refers to the initial adsorbate concentration mg l 1 rl reflects the adsorption nature which may be unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 freundlich model is applied to multilayer adsorption describing reversible adsorption this model supposes heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface with non uniform distribution of adsorption affinities over the surface 33 another isotherm is dubinin radushkevich an empirical model used to express the adsorption process onto a heterogeneous surface physical and chemical adsorption of metal ions can be distinguished by the mean free energy of adsorption e represented as 4 e 1 2 β where β is the isotherm constant of dubinin radushkevich mol2 j 2 if e 8 kj mol 1 physical adsorption occurs however if 8 e 16 kj mol 1 ion exchange or chemical absorption contributes to adsorption furthermore if e 16 kj mol 1 particle diffusion is the dominant reaction 34 in the temkin isotherm model by ignoring the extremely low and large value of concentrations it is assumed that enthalpy of adsorption for all molecules would linearly decline rather than logarithmic with coverage as can be seen uniform distribution of binding energies up to maximum binding energy is taken into account in this model 31 35 qe adsorption amount at equilibrium mg g 1 qm maximum adsorption

column experiments were used for evaluating the heavy metal removal in porous media and estimating the relationship between time and effluent concentration in a fixed bed operation the experiments were performed in an acrylic column with a diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 16 5 cm in order to pack the column with go enabled sand the ratio of go to sand was determined 0 1 w w 714 2 mg kg according to the zhuhong ding et al 26 in this research 140 mg of go was ultrasonicated in 35 ml of di water for 15 min and mixed thoroughly with 140 g pure sand and then dried at 35 c for 20 h in an oven as a consequence the go sand black mixture was accomplished by physical interaction although the interaction of sand and go was physical the detachment of go from the surface of the sand particles was insignificant under various phs and while contacting different heavy metals the raman analysis results of the go sand and sand is provided in fig s2 as it is depicted in raman spectra two notable peaks at 1326 and 1586 cm 1 called d and g band respectively confirming the presence of go on the surface of the sand particles moreover based on the specific surface area of sand particles and go sand mass ratio 0 1 the go coverage on sand particles was estimated to be 148 mg m2 after packing the column the filter paper was applied at the inlet of the column to distribute the flow and also a layer of glass wool was used at the outlet to seal the column the columns without go were also packed and prepared to be used as control then the column was subjected to continuous injection of single or mixed metal solutions at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 in a downward direction using a peristaltic pump sanatnamajavan prp tn 555 with a volumetric flow rate of 1 ml min 1 for obtaining experimental breakthrough curves effluent samples were collected at specific time intervals 34 min and the metal concentrations were determined by icp oes mathematical modeling approaches were applied to study and predict the dynamism of the fixed bed adsorption columns because different models have been derived from different assumptions most models are suitable for the limited situation in this research two well known models thomas which considers the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models for dynamic adsorption and adam s bohart models were proposed and discussed in adam s bohart model it is presumed that external mass transfer controls the adsorption rate 36 this model is reliable for the relative concentration region up to 0 5 in breakthrough curves c t c o 0 5 37 in the following the linear form of adam s bohart model can be seen in eq 5 5 ln c o c t k a b n o z u o k a b c o t where k a b l mg 1 min 1 is the adam s bohart kinetic constant and co and ct are the effluent and influent concentrations respectively z cm is the bed depth of column n o mg l 1 is the sorption capacity of the bed u o cm min 1 is the linear velocity calculated by dividing the flow rate by the column section area this model is capable to predict k a b and n o parameters from plots of ln ct c0 versus t min another most widely used model assuming second order reversible reaction kinetics and langmuir isotherm for dynamic adsorption is thomas model 38 the linear form of the thomas model can be described as the following reaction 6 ln c o c t 1 k t h q o w f k t h c o t where k t h l mg 1 min 1 is the thomas kinetic constant f is the volumetric flow rate l min 1 w is the total mass of adsorbent in the column g co and ct are the influent and effluent concentrations respectively and q o is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 k t h and q o values are derived from a plot of ln c0 ct 1 versus t min 2 6 determination of parameters in the fixed bed column the critical bed mass w o and critical bed depth z o are defined as the minimum theoretically bed mass and bed depth respectively and the effluent concentration at t 0 would not exceed the breakthrough concentration c b c o these parameters were obtained in previous study 39 and can be calculated from the following equations 7 w o f k t h q o ln c o c b 1 2 20 f k t h q o 8 z

statistical analysis to quantify the consistency between the experimental data and predicted values obtained by models two error functions rmse and χ2 were used the rmse is commonly used to verify experimental results the rmse and χ2 were calculated using eqs 13 and 14 respectively 13 r m e s 1 n p i 1 n y e x p y c a l i 2 14 χ 2 i 1 n y e x p y c a l 2 y c a l i where n refers to the number of experimental data p is the number of parameters in model y e x p is the experimental datasets and y c a l is the measured values obtained from a model an acceptable agreement between model and measurements would be achieved with the lower values of rmse and χ 2 for a model 39 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go according to the tem image of go fig 1 a go presents a smooth surface with a layered structure the synthesized go had a thin layer and wrinkled edges which confirms that go synthesis had been successfully conducted particle size distribution histogram is shown in fig 1b as can be seen the particle size of the go was 453 32 nm raman spectroscopy is applied to provide information on crystal orientation and also disorder and defects in graphene based materials 40 in fig 2 the intensity of d band at 1320 cm 1 is associated with in plane sp2 domains and the g band at 1588 cm 1 reveals disorders resulted from out of plane vibration mode 41 the oxygen containing groups on the surface of go have been investigated by ft ir analysis the spectrum of go demonstrates the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the go surface the broad peak at 3445 cm 1 is attributed to the hydroxyl groups cooh and coh the peaks at 2927 and 2858 cm 1 correspond to ch2 stretching vibration the band at 1721 cm 1 can be related to co group a specific peak is observed at 1634 cm 1 indicating the existence of cc skeletal vibrations of non oxidized graphitic domains the band observed at 1400 cm 1 is associated with ch2 bending vibration and the peaks range between 1047 and 1242 cm 1 confirm the presence of co band the fesem images presented in fig 3 a d reveals the surface structure of go sand particles and acid washed sand from fig 3b it is clear that a thin layer of go was formed on the surface of go sand mixture conversely fig 3a exhibits rough and uneven pure sand surface according to fig d multi layer go sheets can be clearly seen on the sand particles in the presence of go while no sheets are observed in acid washed sand in fig 3c 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 adsorption equilibrium study the adsorption equilibrium of cr vi as iii cd ii and pb ii sorption isotherms on go were investigated at ph 6 and the related parameters obtained from studied models are listed in table 2 in comparison with linear forms r 2 values obtained by nonlinear equations were all higher so the results were more accurate than those determined by linear analysis according to the rmse and x2 values the nonlinear fitting described the data better than the linear fitting r 2 values in nonlinear analysis indicated that the sorption isotherms fitted better with the freundlich model considering the rmse and x2 values cd ii and pb ii were well fitted by the langmuir model while as iii and cr vi were defined better by the freundlich model therefore the fitting order of the isotherms was langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich for cd ii and pb ii and freundlich langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich for as iii and cr vi according to the freundlich model the values of kf relating to the bond strength and capacity were 9 32 6 4 4 22 and 2 37 for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi respectively this result indicated that lead ion had the highest bond strength to go and chromium ion had the lowest one in freundlich isotherm the heterogeneity of surface and adsorption intensity can be determined by slope ranges between 0 and 1 and suggests that adsorption is favorable 31 35 the surface is getting more heterogeneous when 1 n becomes closer to zero as it is shown in table 2 the 1 n parameter for as iii and cr vi are lower than that for pb ii and cd ii moreover higher observed values for the langmuir constant kl highlights the strong interaction it can be deduced that pb ii and cd ii with higher 1 n values and lower kl interact with equal energies on the homogeneous surfaces and there was no interference between the adsorption sites 42 the sorption capacities of metal ions on go were 14 41 49 78 170 1 and 530 85 mg g 1 for cr vi as iii cd ii and pb ii respectively the batch results denote that pb ii had the highest adsorption capacity among metal ions the higher sorption capacity of metal ions can be explained by considering that the smaller and more electronegative of metal ions have a better interaction with the oxygen containing groups on the go surface 34 43 moreover the stability constants of metal ions and metal chelating ability play an important part in the adsorption and control the transfer of metal ions on to the adsorbent s surface 44 45 cr vi has a negative charge and can form weak bind to oxygen containing groups therefore lower removal efficiency for this metal was observed due to a repulsive force between cr vi and go component in addition cr vi reduction is attributed to the electron donating ability of carboxy groups in go therefore this functional group can improve the conversion of cr vi to cr iii which facilitates and enhance the transfer of electrons from reductants to cr vi 46 as it can be seen in table s1 the concentration of the cr iii is much higher in the adsorbent compared to the effluent this is due to the electrostatic interaction of go and cr iii regarding the rl values between 0 and 1 from langmuir isotherm the adsorption process was effective and reversible in the dubinin radushkevich model pb ii had the highest adsorption free energy and cr vi had the lowest one also since the obtained adsorption free energy e values for all metal ions were lower than 8 kj mol 1 an occurrence of the physisorption process is proved in temkin isotherm pb ii with the b value of 34 28 jmol 1 had the highest heat of the adsorption which confirmed the better adsorption of pb ii ion the maximum adsorption capacities of several adsorbents for target metal ions in previous studies are illustrated in table 3 strong complexation between go and metal ions which is associated with a large number of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go and electrostatic interaction between positive and negative charges of metal ions and the adsorbent are important mechanisms for higher removal of metal ions 1 11 3 2 2 initial concentration contribution to the effective removal the batch tests were done at six initial concentrations ranging between 5 60 mg l 1 to consider the effect of initial metal concentration on the elimination of metal ions by go as it was shown in fig 4 there is an inverse relationship between these two parameters when the initial concentration of metal ions increased the removal efficiency decreased because at lower concentrations there were sufficient specific sites to completely adsorb metal ions while with the increase in metal ion concentration the active sites and the pores of go sheets were saturated however pb ii and cd ii did not experience a significant shift in their removal trend which is due to the high adsorption capacity 3 3 fixed bed column study 3 3 1 individual metal removal the removal efficiency of heavy metals was examined for single metal injection into a sand column with and without go adam s bohart and thomas were two models employed to calculate the model parameters for the sorption of heavy metal ions onto go it can be deduced from column test experiments that adsorption of heavy metals in porous media with go was increased noticeably the results obtained in column tests were in correspondence with the batch experiments the breakthrough curves were constructed by plotting the effluent to influent concentration ratio against the time as presented in fig 5 the behavior of the adsorbent and heavy metals in the sand were also studied in blank columns the heavy metal adsorption phenomena by sand can be illustrated on the basis of the interaction between the surface functional group of silicates sand and the metal ions however having much less electrostatic interaction compared to go sand particles could not remove a significant percentage of the heavy metals as it can be seen the slope of the breakthrough curves of the single mode is as followed pb ii cd ii as iii cr vi which means that the maximum interaction is related to pb ii with maximum freundlich constant kf 9 32 and langmuir constant kl 3 9 l mmol 1 however thomas constant is inversely related to the adsorption rate and pb ii with the lowest thomas constant kth 0 13 has therefore the highest adsorption rate among the experimented metals in column tests without go cr vi showed high mobility and effluent concentration increased to the highest level by applying only one pore volume pv on the other hand ct values for pb ii cd ii and as iii reached to their initial concentration after 10 83 h 4 23 h and 2 57 h respectively breakthrough curve of cr vi obtained for the column of sand with go is provided in fig s3 the results suggested that the mobility of pb ii in blank columns was lower than that of the other three metal ions according to the data presented in table 4 in the presence of go 92 87 88 and 94 increase in retention capacity of column was observed for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi respectively in comparison with blank columns blank columns data for single mode adsorption on thomas model are provided in table 4 based on the q0 values of the blank columns and go sand columns the contribution of sand on the adsorption process of pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi is 1 4 3 2 0 28 and 3 7 respectively compared to the other three metal ions of interest cr vi had the most mobility in the column and can barely be retained in the sand go medium the effluent concentration of cr vi reached the initial concentration in less than 0 23 day while the breakthrough time for pb ii cd ii and as iii were 5 75 1 42 and 0 9 day respectively the observed data and the model simulation were well matched r2 and the best fit values of two model parameters are shown in table 4 r2 values obtained by the thomas model were higher than those of adam s bohart model however in the thomas model values of rsme and x2 were slightly lower than adam s bohart model for pb ii and cd ii while experimental datasets of as iii was fitted better by adam s bohart the reason behind this might be that the thomas modeling approach assumes the langmuir model of adsorption whereas as iii followed the freundlich model a decrease in k t h 51 a constant indicating the adsorption kinetic was observed with increasing the adsorption capacity q o 52 k t h for pb ii and cr vi with the maximum and minimum sorption capacity of 355 4 and 2 58 mg g 1 were 0 12 and 1 49 l mg 1 min 1 respectively which were consistent with the affinity of go for the metal ions pb ii cd ii as iii cr vi the critical bed depth 39 9 cm and critical bed mass 0 34 g needed for cr vi to be retained in the column was noticeably more than those of other heavy metals indicating the higher mobility of cr vi in the column 3 3 2 mixed metal removal column experiments were conducted while mixed metal solutions at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 and the flow rate of 1 mlmin 1 were applied to assess the multicomponent adsorption competition as depicted in fig 5 and table 4 the results showed that like individual metal ions the removal efficiency for pb ii was more than that of cd ii and as iii in comparison with single metal solution injection sharper breakthrough curves were obtained and the sorption capacities were lower the decreases in adsorption capacity were 14 21 and 39 for pb ii cd ii and as iii respectively in mixed mode this attributed to the fact that the adsorption capacity of the sand go medium reached saturation more rapidly when mixed solution passed through the column and metal ions competed for adsorption sites for instance considering the breakthrough curves of the cd ii in single and mixed modes breakthrough occured more rapidly in mixed metal mode moreover by comparing the breakthrough curves of pb ii and cd ii in both mixed and single modes it is obvious that the difference between breakthrough points of the cd ii in mixed and single mode is more than pb ii in mixed and single mode this is due to the fact that in the adsorption process of cd ii in mixed mode pb ii with higher affinity to the surface functional groups on go occupies more active sites and thus resulting in cd ii reaching the breaking point sooner according to table 4 when heavy metals were applied simultaneously critical bed depth z0 and critical bed mass w0 increased due to an increase in heavy metals loaded in the column while the amount of adsorbent was kept constant therefore it led to an early breakthrough and the breakthrough volume decreased considerably it was observed that like single metal removal thomas model described experimental data better than adam s bohart for pb ii and cd ii while the column data of as iii was well fitted to adam s bohart model with respect to fig 5 and table 4 in both individual and mixed metal injections the slope of the breakthrough curves in thomas and adam s bohart models increased according to the following order cr vi as iii pb ii cd ii the results demonstrated that pb ii with maximum adsorption capacity had minimum z0 and w0 values the higher the values of z0 and w0 the more rapidly the saturation of column is achieved and as a consequence the service volume vs decreases significantly 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that go was found to be a promising reactive reagent to remove and mitigate heavy metal transport which its performance was investigated through both batch and column tests in the batch mode adsorption studies nonlinear regression described adsorption isotherm data better than the linear least squares method cr vi had the minimum adsorption capacity 14 41 mg g 1 among other metal ions therefore go cannot be efficient in removing and retention of anionic metal ions the behavior of the metal ions in go sand columns was well predicted by two proposed models thomas and adam s bohart models the breakthrough volumes were 8 3 2 1 3 and 0 33 l for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi in column tests the migration of metal ions enhanced in mixed metal injection than that in single metal injection due to the sorption surface competition in other words there were more available binding sites for adsorption of metal ions in the single metal injection the maximum adsorption capacity and the breakthrough volume increased as the kinetic constant decreased indicating that mass transfer resistance relating to the sorption process decreased therefore a considerable decline in critical bed depth and critical bed mass was also observed in conclusion go enabled sand can be proposed as an efficient medium capable of decreasing the mobility of heavy metals moreover based on the results of this study go enabled sand can be used in large scale columns for the dynamic removal of heavy metals from

13658,in this study sand enriched with graphene oxide go was applied as the medium to prevent heavy metals migration to groundwater the retention of heavy metals including cr vi as iii cd ii and pb ii in the prepared medium was investigated batch experiments results revealed that the adsorption capacities of go were 530 85 170 1 49 78 and 14 41 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi the adsorption characteristics of go were investigated by four linear and nonlinear isotherm models nonlinear freundlich was the best model fitting the experimental observations in equilibrium reactions the presence of go enhanced adsorption capacity of the sand column to 92 87 88 and 94 for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi respectively the retention of single component and a mixture of heavy metals in the prepared medium was studied showing that in the mixture of metals the adsorption capacity of go reduced by 14 21 and 39 for pb ii cd ii and as iii respectively a longer breakthrough time for go was achieved for pb ii 10 83 h and cd ii 4 23 h indicating higher efficiency of the reactive medium in the retention of pb ii and cd ii thomas and adam s bohart kinetic models were applied to express the dynamic characteristics of the proposed medium breakthrough curves of cr vi cd ii and pb ii were successfully predicted by thomas model while that of as iii was described better by adam s bohart model this can be associated with the fact that the thomas model assumes langmuir isotherm while adsorption behavior of as iii was well depicted by freundlich isotherm keywords graphene oxide heavy metals adsorption modeling fixed bed column groundwater porous media 1 introduction over several centuries a growing number of hazardous chemicals release to receiving waters and direct their way deliberately or accidentally into the groundwater resources heavy metals enter into groundwater from different sources including leachate from mine tailings and landfills discharge of domestic and specifically industrial effluents metal contamination is considered to be one of the most hazardous pollutants because of their possible risk to water resources and concomitant threats to human health 1 2 in addition heavy metals are highly toxic persistent non biodegradable and infamous for their carcinogenic impacts on living organisms their bioaccumulation in living tissues may endanger ecological systems and can be absorbed into the living organisms via the food chain 3 5 heavy metal diffusion and mobility through soil layers are contingent upon the changes in soil ph redox potential and also metal complexation with other dissolved elements 6 7 the occurrence of heavy metals in the subsurface system is a significant problem endangering ecological systems 7 8 therefore soil contamination in the unsaturated or vadose zone has gained more attention because it can impose threats to water supply due to the mobilization and transport processes of contaminants 9 therefore elimination and immobilization of heavy metals prior to reaching the groundwater system is necessary and a critical challenge in the perspective of environment and health on the other hand it is essential to find innovative and effective remedial techniques for heavy metal contaminated groundwater and soil on the whole the technologies applied for controlling the discharge of heavy metal into the groundwater can be categorized into three main groups i physico chemical ii chemical iii biological biochemical biosorption several in situ technologies such as permeable reactive barriers reduction biosorption biorestoration chemical flushing electrokinetic treatment and adsorption have been used to restrict heavy metal release to groundwater however adsorption is a physicochemical treatment technology that is mainly used to immobilize contaminants and mitigate their migration to the environment 6 10 this method was found to be a feasible and cost effective approach which can be extensively used in different remediation practices 11 a variety of materials have been tested as adsorbents such as zeolite montmorillonite kaolinite zero valent iron activated carbon and carbon nanotubes cnts among which carbon materials have been used increasingly because of their excellent chemical stability and high adsorption capacity 12 13 graphene oxide go the oxidation product of graphene regarded as next generation material has emerged as a novel adsorbent for removing contaminants including inorganic and organic pollutants particularly heavy metals 13 14 it has attracted tremendous attention because of its remarkable properties such as excellent electrical and thermal conductivity high specific surface area 2620 m2 g 16 it is one of the carbon based nanomaterials with a unique structure containing hydroxyl epoxy carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups high sorption performance of go toward metal ions is attributed to its specific physicochemical properties and the higher electronegativity of oxygen over carbon atoms 17 18 therefore electrostatic attraction surface complexation and ion exchange are considered principal mechanisms for immobilization of metal ions 19 recently several studies have been conducted on the sorption ability of go toward heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions such as pb ii cd ii co ii cr cu ii and eu iii 20 21 modified graphene oxide was also used for water purification and removal of as iii cd ii and cr vi 1 22 23 according to the investigations the adsorption of heavy metals on go is dependent on contact time the initial metal ion concentration ph sorbent dose and temperature but independent on the ionic strength 24 to the best of our knowledge however few studies were devoted to the investigation of the sorption of multicomponent metal ions on go in aqueous solutions 25 26 sitko et al evaluated the competition for sorption between heavy metals including cu ii cd ii zn ii and pb ii on go in aqueous solutions the results indicated that adsorption capacities were in the order of pb ii cu ii cd ii zn ii 25 in recent studies the application of go as a reactive adsorbent in fixed bed columns has grown significantly due to the high mobility of go a material like sand is required as a support to immobilize go and also enhance the go surface area gong et al investigated the adsorption of pb ii and methylene blue in the ﬁxed bed column filled with go coated sand and yoon nelson model was used for prediction of the breakthrough curves it was concluded that the adsorption capacity of the column increased greatly by go 27 ding et al found that go could be used as in sand columns as a layer to remove heavy metals including pb ii and cu ii from aqueous solutions the removal efficiency was improved by increasing the amount of go in the column on the contrary a rise in the flow rate led to lower heavy metal sorption in gong et al study the transport of contaminants was simulated by the convection dispersion reaction model but the adsorption performance of adsorbent was not considered 26 however the role of the mixture of go sand filter in column tests simultaneous removal of heavy metals and their competitive interactions were not addressed in these studies specifically the kinetic models and dynamic equilibrium for target contaminants in the mixed condition have not been extensively characterized in this fixed bed system this study is an attempt to investigate the efficacy of go as an adsorbent for heavy metal immobilization and its role in creating the reactive zone in porous media firstly the batch experiments were conducted to examine the adsorbent performance in the removal of four heavy metals pb ii cd ii cr vi and as iii and the results were modeled by langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherms the second objective of this study was to investigate the retention of target contaminants in go sand medium in single and mixed sorbate solutions moreover due to the importance of the time and appearance of the breakthrough curve for determining the transport of contaminants and the dynamic response of an adsorption column design and prediction of the concentration time profile for the effluents were done by kinetic models adam s bohart and thomas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals graphene oxide was synthesized from puriﬁed natural graphite according to the modified hummer s method 28 sand standard sand silica co with a particle size of 300 420 μm was used the sand was washed with tap water nitric acid 10 v v and

with an accelerating voltage of 200 kv raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the go raman spectra were recorded with a raman spectrometer senterra bruker germany with a laser excitation wavelength of 785 nm surface functional groups were characterized through fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer bruker tensor 27 germany moreover high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem tescan mira3 czech was employed to analyze the structure of go enabled sand and acid washed sand particles for measuring the size of the go nanoparticles the dynamic light scattering dls method was employed malvern nano s the total cr concentration was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 730oes varian and the concentration of cr iii ions was calculated from the difference between the total cr and cr vi concentrations 2 3 batch adsorption experiments to describe the adsorption equilibrium characteristics batch adsorption studies were employed adsorption isotherms were obtained using solutions in which the concentration of single metal ions was in the range of 5 60 mg l 1 and the go concentration was kept constant at first 30 mg of go was added to 25 ml of di water and was dispersed thoroughly by ultrasonication for 15 min then metal ion solution was added and volumes were adjusted to 50 ml thereby preparing the sample solutions with the final concentrations of 5 10 20 30 40 60 mg l 1 the ph of solutions was adjusted to 6 by 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and naoh after that the metal solutions were added to the go and stirred for one hour at room temperature ph value of 6 was chosen because the normal ph of the groundwater system is between 6 8 5 also the higher stability of the solution of go and metal ions without precipitation was achieved in ph 6 contact time of one hour was chosen based on the preliminary experiment on the effect of time on the adsorption capacity fig s1 then the resulting mixtures were centrifuged 7000 rpm for 30 min inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 730oes varian was applied to determine the metal ion concentration in the solutions the sorption quantity and removal efficiency of adsorbent were calculated according to the following equations 1 re m o v a l c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e v m where qe mg g 1 is sorption quantity c o and c e mg l 1 are the initial and residual concentrations of the adsorbate respectively v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of adsorbent 2 4 adsorption isotherm models the adsorption isotherm is a curve that is used for describing the adsorption performance a wide variety of equilibrium isotherm models have been developed for investigation of adsorbent behavior and obtaining adsorption parameters 30 in the present study langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherms were employed to model the experimental datasets the nonlinear and linearized forms of the proposed isotherm models are presented in table 1 based on langmuir adsorption isotherm the adsorbed layer is one molecule in thickness in this model the adsorption is homogenous and active sites are identical with equal sorption activation energy 31 adsorption nature can be evaluated by a separation factor rl constant deﬁned by webber and chakkravorti 32 it is computed by the following equation 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where kl l mg is the langmuir constant and c0 refers to the initial adsorbate concentration mg l 1 rl reflects the adsorption nature which may be unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 freundlich model is applied to multilayer adsorption describing reversible adsorption this model supposes heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface with non uniform distribution of adsorption affinities over the surface 33 another isotherm is dubinin radushkevich an empirical model used to express the adsorption process onto a heterogeneous surface physical and chemical adsorption of metal ions can be distinguished by the mean free energy of adsorption e represented as 4 e 1 2 β where β is the isotherm constant of dubinin radushkevich mol2 j 2 if e 8 kj mol 1 physical adsorption occurs however if 8 e 16 kj mol 1 ion exchange or chemical absorption contributes to adsorption furthermore if e 16 kj mol 1 particle diffusion is the dominant reaction 34 in the temkin isotherm model by ignoring the extremely low and large value of concentrations it is assumed that enthalpy of adsorption for all molecules would linearly decline rather than logarithmic with coverage as can be seen uniform distribution of binding energies up to maximum binding energy is taken into account in this model 31 35 qe adsorption amount at equilibrium mg g 1 qm maximum adsorption

column experiments were used for evaluating the heavy metal removal in porous media and estimating the relationship between time and effluent concentration in a fixed bed operation the experiments were performed in an acrylic column with a diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 16 5 cm in order to pack the column with go enabled sand the ratio of go to sand was determined 0 1 w w 714 2 mg kg according to the zhuhong ding et al 26 in this research 140 mg of go was ultrasonicated in 35 ml of di water for 15 min and mixed thoroughly with 140 g pure sand and then dried at 35 c for 20 h in an oven as a consequence the go sand black mixture was accomplished by physical interaction although the interaction of sand and go was physical the detachment of go from the surface of the sand particles was insignificant under various phs and while contacting different heavy metals the raman analysis results of the go sand and sand is provided in fig s2 as it is depicted in raman spectra two notable peaks at 1326 and 1586 cm 1 called d and g band respectively confirming the presence of go on the surface of the sand particles moreover based on the specific surface area of sand particles and go sand mass ratio 0 1 the go coverage on sand particles was estimated to be 148 mg m2 after packing the column the filter paper was applied at the inlet of the column to distribute the flow and also a layer of glass wool was used at the outlet to seal the column the columns without go were also packed and prepared to be used as control then the column was subjected to continuous injection of single or mixed metal solutions at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 in a downward direction using a peristaltic pump sanatnamajavan prp tn 555 with a volumetric flow rate of 1 ml min 1 for obtaining experimental breakthrough curves effluent samples were collected at specific time intervals 34 min and the metal concentrations were determined by icp oes mathematical modeling approaches were applied to study and predict the dynamism of the fixed bed adsorption columns because different models have been derived from different assumptions most models are suitable for the limited situation in this research two well known models thomas which considers the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models for dynamic adsorption and adam s bohart models were proposed and discussed in adam s bohart model it is presumed that external mass transfer controls the adsorption rate 36 this model is reliable for the relative concentration region up to 0 5 in breakthrough curves c t c o 0 5 37 in the following the linear form of adam s bohart model can be seen in eq 5 5 ln c o c t k a b n o z u o k a b c o t where k a b l mg 1 min 1 is the adam s bohart kinetic constant and co and ct are the effluent and influent concentrations respectively z cm is the bed depth of column n o mg l 1 is the sorption capacity of the bed u o cm min 1 is the linear velocity calculated by dividing the flow rate by the column section area this model is capable to predict k a b and n o parameters from plots of ln ct c0 versus t min another most widely used model assuming second order reversible reaction kinetics and langmuir isotherm for dynamic adsorption is thomas model 38 the linear form of the thomas model can be described as the following reaction 6 ln c o c t 1 k t h q o w f k t h c o t where k t h l mg 1 min 1 is the thomas kinetic constant f is the volumetric flow rate l min 1 w is the total mass of adsorbent in the column g co and ct are the influent and effluent concentrations respectively and q o is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 k t h and q o values are derived from a plot of ln c0 ct 1 versus t min 2 6 determination of parameters in the fixed bed column the critical bed mass w o and critical bed depth z o are defined as the minimum theoretically bed mass and bed depth respectively and the effluent concentration at t 0 would not exceed the breakthrough concentration c b c o these parameters were obtained in previous study 39 and can be calculated from the following equations 7 w o f k t h q o ln c o c b 1 2 20 f k t h q o 8 z

statistical analysis to quantify the consistency between the experimental data and predicted values obtained by models two error functions rmse and χ2 were used the rmse is commonly used to verify experimental results the rmse and χ2 were calculated using eqs 13 and 14 respectively 13 r m e s 1 n p i 1 n y e x p y c a l i 2 14 χ 2 i 1 n y e x p y c a l 2 y c a l i where n refers to the number of experimental data p is the number of parameters in model y e x p is the experimental datasets and y c a l is the measured values obtained from a model an acceptable agreement between model and measurements would be achieved with the lower values of rmse and χ 2 for a model 39 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go according to the tem image of go fig 1 a go presents a smooth surface with a layered structure the synthesized go had a thin layer and wrinkled edges which confirms that go synthesis had been successfully conducted particle size distribution histogram is shown in fig 1b as can be seen the particle size of the go was 453 32 nm raman spectroscopy is applied to provide information on crystal orientation and also disorder and defects in graphene based materials 40 in fig 2 the intensity of d band at 1320 cm 1 is associated with in plane sp2 domains and the g band at 1588 cm 1 reveals disorders resulted from out of plane vibration mode 41 the oxygen containing groups on the surface of go have been investigated by ft ir analysis the spectrum of go demonstrates the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the go surface the broad peak at 3445 cm 1 is attributed to the hydroxyl groups cooh and coh the peaks at 2927 and 2858 cm 1 correspond to ch2 stretching vibration the band at 1721 cm 1 can be related to co group a specific peak is observed at 1634 cm 1 indicating the existence of cc skeletal vibrations of non oxidized graphitic domains the band observed at 1400 cm 1 is associated with ch2 bending vibration and the peaks range between 1047 and 1242 cm 1 confirm the presence of co band the fesem images presented in fig 3 a d reveals the surface structure of go sand particles and acid washed sand from fig 3b it is clear that a thin layer of go was formed on the surface of go sand mixture conversely fig 3a exhibits rough and uneven pure sand surface according to fig d multi layer go sheets can be clearly seen on the sand particles in the presence of go while no sheets are observed in acid washed sand in fig 3c 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 adsorption equilibrium study the adsorption equilibrium of cr vi as iii cd ii and pb ii sorption isotherms on go were investigated at ph 6 and the related parameters obtained from studied models are listed in table 2 in comparison with linear forms r 2 values obtained by nonlinear equations were all higher so the results were more accurate than those determined by linear analysis according to the rmse and x2 values the nonlinear fitting described the data better than the linear fitting r 2 values in nonlinear analysis indicated that the sorption isotherms fitted better with the freundlich model considering the rmse and x2 values cd ii and pb ii were well fitted by the langmuir model while as iii and cr vi were defined better by the freundlich model therefore the fitting order of the isotherms was langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich for cd ii and pb ii and freundlich langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich for as iii and cr vi according to the freundlich model the values of kf relating to the bond strength and capacity were 9 32 6 4 4 22 and 2 37 for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi respectively this result indicated that lead ion had the highest bond strength to go and chromium ion had the lowest one in freundlich isotherm the heterogeneity of surface and adsorption intensity can be determined by slope ranges between 0 and 1 and suggests that adsorption is favorable 31 35 the surface is getting more heterogeneous when 1 n becomes closer to zero as it is shown in table 2 the 1 n parameter for as iii and cr vi are lower than that for pb ii and cd ii moreover higher observed values for the langmuir constant kl highlights the strong interaction it can be deduced that pb ii and cd ii with higher 1 n values and lower kl interact with equal energies on the homogeneous surfaces and there was no interference between the adsorption sites 42 the sorption capacities of metal ions on go were 14 41 49 78 170 1 and 530 85 mg g 1 for cr vi as iii cd ii and pb ii respectively the batch results denote that pb ii had the highest adsorption capacity among metal ions the higher sorption capacity of metal ions can be explained by considering that the smaller and more electronegative of metal ions have a better interaction with the oxygen containing groups on the go surface 34 43 moreover the stability constants of metal ions and metal chelating ability play an important part in the adsorption and control the transfer of metal ions on to the adsorbent s surface 44 45 cr vi has a negative charge and can form weak bind to oxygen containing groups therefore lower removal efficiency for this metal was observed due to a repulsive force between cr vi and go component in addition cr vi reduction is attributed to the electron donating ability of carboxy groups in go therefore this functional group can improve the conversion of cr vi to cr iii which facilitates and enhance the transfer of electrons from reductants to cr vi 46 as it can be seen in table s1 the concentration of the cr iii is much higher in the adsorbent compared to the effluent this is due to the electrostatic interaction of go and cr iii regarding the rl values between 0 and 1 from langmuir isotherm the adsorption process was effective and reversible in the dubinin radushkevich model pb ii had the highest adsorption free energy and cr vi had the lowest one also since the obtained adsorption free energy e values for all metal ions were lower than 8 kj mol 1 an occurrence of the physisorption process is proved in temkin isotherm pb ii with the b value of 34 28 jmol 1 had the highest heat of the adsorption which confirmed the better adsorption of pb ii ion the maximum adsorption capacities of several adsorbents for target metal ions in previous studies are illustrated in table 3 strong complexation between go and metal ions which is associated with a large number of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go and electrostatic interaction between positive and negative charges of metal ions and the adsorbent are important mechanisms for higher removal of metal ions 1 11 3 2 2 initial concentration contribution to the effective removal the batch tests were done at six initial concentrations ranging between 5 60 mg l 1 to consider the effect of initial metal concentration on the elimination of metal ions by go as it was shown in fig 4 there is an inverse relationship between these two parameters when the initial concentration of metal ions increased the removal efficiency decreased because at lower concentrations there were sufficient specific sites to completely adsorb metal ions while with the increase in metal ion concentration the active sites and the pores of go sheets were saturated however pb ii and cd ii did not experience a significant shift in their removal trend which is due to the high adsorption capacity 3 3 fixed bed column study 3 3 1 individual metal removal the removal efficiency of heavy metals was examined for single metal injection into a sand column with and without go adam s bohart and thomas were two models employed to calculate the model parameters for the sorption of heavy metal ions onto go it can be deduced from column test experiments that adsorption of heavy metals in porous media with go was increased noticeably the results obtained in column tests were in correspondence with the batch experiments the breakthrough curves were constructed by plotting the effluent to influent concentration ratio against the time as presented in fig 5 the behavior of the adsorbent and heavy metals in the sand were also studied in blank columns the heavy metal adsorption phenomena by sand can be illustrated on the basis of the interaction between the surface functional group of silicates sand and the metal ions however having much less electrostatic interaction compared to go sand particles could not remove a significant percentage of the heavy metals as it can be seen the slope of the breakthrough curves of the single mode is as followed pb ii cd ii as iii cr vi which means that the maximum interaction is related to pb ii with maximum freundlich constant kf 9 32 and langmuir constant kl 3 9 l mmol 1 however thomas constant is inversely related to the adsorption rate and pb ii with the lowest thomas constant kth 0 13 has therefore the highest adsorption rate among the experimented metals in column tests without go cr vi showed high mobility and effluent concentration increased to the highest level by applying only one pore volume pv on the other hand ct values for pb ii cd ii and as iii reached to their initial concentration after 10 83 h 4 23 h and 2 57 h respectively breakthrough curve of cr vi obtained for the column of sand with go is provided in fig s3 the results suggested that the mobility of pb ii in blank columns was lower than that of the other three metal ions according to the data presented in table 4 in the presence of go 92 87 88 and 94 increase in retention capacity of column was observed for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi respectively in comparison with blank columns blank columns data for single mode adsorption on thomas model are provided in table 4 based on the q0 values of the blank columns and go sand columns the contribution of sand on the adsorption process of pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi is 1 4 3 2 0 28 and 3 7 respectively compared to the other three metal ions of interest cr vi had the most mobility in the column and can barely be retained in the sand go medium the effluent concentration of cr vi reached the initial concentration in less than 0 23 day while the breakthrough time for pb ii cd ii and as iii were 5 75 1 42 and 0 9 day respectively the observed data and the model simulation were well matched r2 and the best fit values of two model parameters are shown in table 4 r2 values obtained by the thomas model were higher than those of adam s bohart model however in the thomas model values of rsme and x2 were slightly lower than adam s bohart model for pb ii and cd ii while experimental datasets of as iii was fitted better by adam s bohart the reason behind this might be that the thomas modeling approach assumes the langmuir model of adsorption whereas as iii followed the freundlich model a decrease in k t h 51 a constant indicating the adsorption kinetic was observed with increasing the adsorption capacity q o 52 k t h for pb ii and cr vi with the maximum and minimum sorption capacity of 355 4 and 2 58 mg g 1 were 0 12 and 1 49 l mg 1 min 1 respectively which were consistent with the affinity of go for the metal ions pb ii cd ii as iii cr vi the critical bed depth 39 9 cm and critical bed mass 0 34 g needed for cr vi to be retained in the column was noticeably more than those of other heavy metals indicating the higher mobility of cr vi in the column 3 3 2 mixed metal removal column experiments were conducted while mixed metal solutions at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 and the flow rate of 1 mlmin 1 were applied to assess the multicomponent adsorption competition as depicted in fig 5 and table 4 the results showed that like individual metal ions the removal efficiency for pb ii was more than that of cd ii and as iii in comparison with single metal solution injection sharper breakthrough curves were obtained and the sorption capacities were lower the decreases in adsorption capacity were 14 21 and 39 for pb ii cd ii and as iii respectively in mixed mode this attributed to the fact that the adsorption capacity of the sand go medium reached saturation more rapidly when mixed solution passed through the column and metal ions competed for adsorption sites for instance considering the breakthrough curves of the cd ii in single and mixed modes breakthrough occured more rapidly in mixed metal mode moreover by comparing the breakthrough curves of pb ii and cd ii in both mixed and single modes it is obvious that the difference between breakthrough points of the cd ii in mixed and single mode is more than pb ii in mixed and single mode this is due to the fact that in the adsorption process of cd ii in mixed mode pb ii with higher affinity to the surface functional groups on go occupies more active sites and thus resulting in cd ii reaching the breaking point sooner according to table 4 when heavy metals were applied simultaneously critical bed depth z0 and critical bed mass w0 increased due to an increase in heavy metals loaded in the column while the amount of adsorbent was kept constant therefore it led to an early breakthrough and the breakthrough volume decreased considerably it was observed that like single metal removal thomas model described experimental data better than adam s bohart for pb ii and cd ii while the column data of as iii was well fitted to adam s bohart model with respect to fig 5 and table 4 in both individual and mixed metal injections the slope of the breakthrough curves in thomas and adam s bohart models increased according to the following order cr vi as iii pb ii cd ii the results demonstrated that pb ii with maximum adsorption capacity had minimum z0 and w0 values the higher the values of z0 and w0 the more rapidly the saturation of column is achieved and as a consequence the service volume vs decreases significantly 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that go was found to be a promising reactive reagent to remove and mitigate heavy metal transport which its performance was investigated through both batch and column tests in the batch mode adsorption studies nonlinear regression described adsorption isotherm data better than the linear least squares method cr vi had the minimum adsorption capacity 14 41 mg g 1 among other metal ions therefore go cannot be efficient in removing and retention of anionic metal ions the behavior of the metal ions in go sand columns was well predicted by two proposed models thomas and adam s bohart models the breakthrough volumes were 8 3 2 1 3 and 0 33 l for pb ii cd ii as iii and cr vi in column tests the migration of metal ions enhanced in mixed metal injection than that in single metal injection due to the sorption surface competition in other words there were more available binding sites for adsorption of metal ions in the single metal injection the maximum adsorption capacity and the breakthrough volume increased as the kinetic constant decreased indicating that mass transfer resistance relating to the sorption process decreased therefore a considerable decline in critical bed depth and critical bed mass was also observed in conclusion go enabled sand can be proposed as an efficient medium capable of decreasing the mobility of heavy metals moreover based on the results of this study go enabled sand can be used in large scale columns for the dynamic removal of heavy metals from

13659,intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb provides novel insights into the removal of refractory pollutants however the practical application of icpb was limited by low bacterial loading density and low microbial activity herein an environment friendly low cost and renewable biocarrier was fabricated using natural loofah sponge in comparison to polyurethane carrier after employing loofah sponge in icpb the tetracycline hydrochloride tch removal rate was increased by 6 6 the mineralization was increased by 9 2 and almost all photocatalytic products were degraded compared with conventional catalyst coating strategies our powder spraying method enables the exterior surface of biocarrier to be firmly coated by the photocatalyst while the inside of biocarrier was extremely clean to accumulate bacteria the biocarrier provided a higher loading density and a higher microbial activity of bacteria than that of polyurethane carrier besides it can regulate the bacterial community to have more favorable members to biodegrade the photocatalysis intermediates in summary using loofah sponge as biocarrier could be an effective approach for enhancing the biodegradation performance of icpb keywords bio carrier microbial activity tetracycline bacterial community nomenclature icpb intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation vpcb visible light

ratio 1 introduction the water environmental concern is one of the most important global challenges along with the industrialization and urbanization growing across the world today 1 4 intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb is a novel wastewater treatment technique that has potential applications in refractory degradation 5 8 for an icpb system it is ideal to coat photocatalyst on the exterior surface of carrier while keeping the inside of carrier available and clean to load bacteria 9 in this case the photocatalytic products on the exterior carrier could diffuse into the interior carrier and be immediately biodegraded by the internal bacteria 9 10 nevertheless current photocatalyst coating strategies such as low temperature sintering and sol gel methods not only load photocatalysts on the exterior carrier but also allow the interior carrier loaded by photocatalysts which could limit the accumulation of bacteria on the interior carrier due to the attack of free radicals generated from photocatalysis 5 11 13 besides poor catalysts stability of loaded photocatalysts and poor biocompatibility of polyurethane carrier to bacteria also limit the practical application of icpb 14 to make the icpb more applicable and more efficient in wastewater treatment the above mentioned defects must be overcome in our previous work we used glue sticking and powder spraying method to coat photocatalysts to the exterior surface of carrier 15 which not only keeps the interior surface of carrier clean to accumulate bacteria but also provides a more stable photocatalyst loading than any other conventional catalyst coating method nevertheless the polyurethane carrier commonly used for icpb have poor compatibility with bacteria due to the toxicity of 2 4 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dnt used in the polyurethane production 16 to overcome this weakness carriers with better biocompatibility and hence higher bacteria accumulation and activity are required biocompatible and naturally available biomass materials provide a potential alternative for icpb carrier loofah sponges derived from fully ripened fruit of loofah plants are very low cost and easy obtained biomass material in china and southeast asia 17 and they have been widely used for bath or kitchen cleaning due to their soft texture and high water uptake capability since loofah sponges possess a natural 3d macroporous structure similar to that of synthetic sponge and are sustainable and renewable resource we consider them a suitable biocarrier for icpb 18 19 in this study we investigate the application of loofah sponge as carriers in icpb process for the first time the bi24o31br10 was chosen as the photocatalyst for our experiment as it is inexpensive and highly efficient visible light responsive photocatalyst 20 we coated loofah sponge with bi24o31br10 photocatalyst and then immersed them in the un acclimated activated sludge to cultivate the biofilms inside loofah sponge fig 1 the removal and mineralization of tetracycline hydrochloride tch was evaluated by a visible light induced icpb called vpcb system the effects of carriers including biocarriers and polyurethane carriers exerted on the survival of biofilms and the evolution of bacteria community are investigated the results show that in comparison to the conventional polyurethane sponge the biocarrier of loofah sponge shows favorable effect on microorganism accumulation bacterial community regulation as well as final performance of icpb 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of photocatalyst to

bi24o31br10 fig 2d since the photocatalyst coating did not block the macroporous structure of the loofah sponge fig 2c bi24o31br10 coated carriers can be used for further biofilm cultivation macropores on the carriers provide accesses for microbial migration from the exterior into the interior section of loofah sponge meanwhile the bones especially the interior bones provide sites for biofilm attachment and growth fig 3 shows the exterior and interior of bi24o31br10 coated carriers after biofilm cultivation photocatalysts were mainly observed on the exterior surface of loofah sponge due to our spray coating strategy 15 short rod bacteria were mainly bound to the interior of loofah sponges fig 3b few bacteria were observed on the exterior surface of loofah sponge fig 3a likely because the photocatalysts coated on the exterior were poison to bacteria which suppress the bacteria attachment and growth after vpc b l operation the bacteria on the interior was still well attached fig 3d while the biofilm on the exterior reduced to some degree due to the photocatalysis induced damage fig 3c all phenomena were typical characteristic of vpcb confirming the successful fabrication of vpc b l the same phenomena also occurred in the vpcb p system but the bacterial loading density on the polyurethane carriers was significantly lower than that of the biocarrier figure s3 which may be due to the smaller pore size 100 500 μm and lower hydrophilicity of the polyurethane sponge compared to the loofah sponge figure s4 3 2 enhancing tch removal and mineralization for the degradation test the results of different protocols are shown in fig 4 a tch was not degraded by visible light photolysis p for the absorption performance the tch concentration rapidly decreased during the first 2 h then maintained steady at the removal rate of 21 4 and 31 1 of ad l and ad p respectively the higher adsorption efficiency of polyurethane carrier is likely attributed to its higher specific surface areas 2 3 m2 g protocols b and ad showed similar declines which means that tch losses in b were due to adsorption not biodegradation the tch removal rates of vpc l and vpc p reached 54 7 and 64 0 respectively indicating that the bi24o31br10 were highly efficient for tch photocatalytic degradation the higher tch removal rates of vpc p was likely due to the higher adsorption efficiency of polyurethane carrier ad p ad l fig 4a the vpcb protocols showed more efficient tch removal capabilities than vpc alone in the first 1 5 h tch concentration rapidly decreased because of carrier adsorption while between 1 5 h 8 h the residual tch was removed through vpcb at mild rates after 8 h vpc b l and vpcb p showed tch removal rates of 89 0 and 82 4 respectively biodegradation accelerated tch degradation and enhanced the final tch removal rate by 34 3 and 18 4 higher for vpc b l and vpcb p than corresponding vpc protocols this result indicates that the biocarrier showed higher biodegradation efficiency than polyurethane carrier in this way the intermediates obtained from photocatalysis can be biodegraded more rapidly which reducing the competition with tch for free radicals i e photocatalytic free radicals of vpc b l could attack tch more efficiently than vpc l 5 additional four vpc b l tests with 8 h for each cycle were carried out to evaluate the reusability of the biocarrier for tch degradation figure s5 at the end of the 1 st 2nd 3rd and 4th cycle 87 4 86 8 86 3 and 85 2 of tch were removed by the vpc b l protocol this suggests that vpc b l can maintain stable and good performance after long time running in order to further investigate the degradation performance of vpc b l the dissolved organic carbon doc in the spent liquid was measured as shown in fig 4b comparing with vpcb p nearly more than 9 2 doc was further removed after using vpcb l the extra removal of doc should be attributed to the better biodegradation of loofah sponge which provides biocompatible environment for bacteria loading and growth 3 3 tch degradation pathways uplc ms techniques were performed to identify the intermediates of tch figure s6 and possible pathways for tch degradation fig 5 were elucidated based on mass spectrometry the initial products with m z of 461 417 and 340 were formed through the hydroxylation nc bond cleavage and deamination of tch respectively 5 10 subsequent products with m z of 434 and 476 were produced from the product with an m z of 461 via demethylation hydroxylation respectively the product with an m z of 373 was produced from the product with m z of 417 by hydroxyl radical attack and deamination after vpc the above mentioned 4 ring products can be detected suggesting that the photocatalysis can only degrade tch without ring opening most of tch s 4 ringed molecular structures were destroyed after vpcb ultimately after vpcb p protocol only one ring and ring opening residuals with m z values of 184 and 144 were obtained when vpcb l was applied the products with m z values of 184 disappeared and products with smaller m z values of 114 were obtained this suggests that the aromatic compound was totally degraded at the end of the vpcb l protocol and the biocarrier provided higher biodegradation degree than polyurethane carrier the removal of aromatic compounds in vpcb p and vpcb l reveals that the biodegradation of intermediates could reduce the consumption of free radicals generated from photocatalysis hence keep more free radicals available for tch degradation 3 4 enhanced microbial survival and activity 3 4 1 microbial dha because dhas are the mainly enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway converting glucose to pyruvate dha activities are widely used to represent microbial activity 22 dha levels gradually decreased in all vpcb protocols during operation fig 6 the final dha content of vpcb l was approximately 67 of the initial level the dha in vpcb p decreased to a greater extent than that in the vpcb l protocol and the dha content was reduced to 40 of the initial dha level this suggests that the polyurethane sponge substantially suppressed microbial activity during vpcb while the biocarrier exert much less suppressing effect on the dehydrogenase activity 3 4 2 microbial eps and living dead cell distribution the production of eps during endogenous respiration affects the bioactivities of bacteria 23 the initial concentration of eps containing polysaccharides and proteins where protein was the major component was similar in the vpcb l and vpcb p protocols fig 7 as the degradation process progressed the eps concentration in both protocols showed same variation trends with polysaccharides and proteins content both increase at 4 h degradation and decrease between 4 h and 8 h degradation time the increment in eps concentration is due to the exposure of biofilms to toxic environments 23 which allow the biofilms secrete a large amount of eps from self regulation and self protection the decrease of eps concentration at 8 h is due to the endogenous respiration of bacteria which use the eps as food supply for bio consumption 24 in comparison to the vpcb l vpcb p protocol showed a more significant increase in the eps concentration fig 4a suggesting that the polyurethane carrier shows a more severe bio inhibitory effect than loofah carrier ros is another harsh environmental factor influencing microorganisms growth whereas we consider their impact on eps secretion is quite minimal because the diffusion of ros from exterior of loofah sponge where photocatalyst loads to interior is quite difficulty which makes the attack of ros to microorganisms really hard 14 the distribution of living cells and dead cells on the spent carriers after experiment is shown in figure s7 for vpcb p the dead bacteria exhibited a uniform distribution on exterior and interior of carrier while the bacteria death on exterior was more severe figure s7c and d in case of vpcb l a higher bacterial loading density is observed on biocarrier than that on polyurethane carrier of vpcb p confirming the superior environment of loofah sponge than polyurethane carrier for bacteria loading and growth in comparison to the interior of biocarrier the exterior showed a wider microbial death zone this is because the exterior possess much high loading of photocatalysts than the interior which allow more ros attack to bacteria there figure s7a and b 3 5 functionalized microbial community biofilms were collected to study the biotransformation that occurred during the degradation of tch in the vpcb systems the microbial community transformation analysis revealed that the bacterial community was regulated after degradation process figure s8 prior to tch degradation raw the dominant classes were grammaproteobacteria and bacteroidia which are typical microbial groups in biological wastewater treatment processes 25 while grammaproteobacteria declined significantly after tch degradation bacteroidia became more abundant in the vpcb systems bacteroidia are well known for scavenging a wide range of organic substrates including aromatics 26 the abundance of deltaproteobacteria known to harbor phenylide resistant gene 27 was higher in vpcb p system than in vpcb l system indicating that a large amount of phenylide was present in vpcb p system the heat map clearly displays the evolution of the bacterial community at the genus level fig 8 members of hydrogenophaga 10 sphingobacterium 7 and terrimonas which are gram negative genus common in activated sludge were dominant in the biofilms cultivated on the carriers raw after tch degradation bacteriovorax and formivibrio and paludibacter which are capable of degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were more abundant in vpcb l system than in vpcb p system 5 the flourishing of these genus in vpcb l illustrates that biocarrier is more susceptible to the regulation of the formation of functional microbial groups for the degradation of tch and the mineralization of byproducts in addition the emerging christensenellaceae thauera fibrobacter desulfobulbus sulfobacillus desulfobulbus cupriavidus and salinispira genera whose abundance is known to be positively correlated with the concentration of phenylide and cyanide 16 enriched in vpcb p operation the genus capable of removing aromatic hydrocarbons was significantly decreased and the genus harboring the benzene resistant gene became more abundant in vpcb p system indicating the toxicity of the polyurethane carrier to most functional microbial communities 3 6 summary the application of loofah sponges as a biocarrier in the icpb process are first reported by this work we found that biocarrier offered obvious advantages over polyurethane carrier first the loofah sponges are naturally available and abundant second loofah sponges are non toxic to bacteria which can provide a higher bacterial loading density for vpcb system figure s7 third loofah sponges play a key role in increasing microbial activity keeping bacterial metabolism more stable fig 7 fourth the microbial community on the loofah sponges can be optimized and the genus of the biodegradable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be more abundant fig 8 all of these effects work together in vpcb contributing to an enhanced tch removal rate and more complete mineralization 4 conclusions loofah sponge a simple cost effective and green biocarrier was first reported as an icpb carrier in our work in comparison to conventional polyurethane carriers the biocarriers could promote the tch removal rate and the mineralization degree by 6 6 and 9 2 respectively the loofah sponges could provide a higher loading density and a higher microbial activity of bacteria than that of polyurethane carriers besides it can regulate the bacterial community to have more favorable members to biodegrade the photocatalysis intermediates in this case using loofah sponges as carriers could be an effective approach for enhancing the biodegradation performance of icpb declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

13659,intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb provides novel insights into the removal of refractory pollutants however the practical application of icpb was limited by low bacterial loading density and low microbial activity herein an environment friendly low cost and renewable biocarrier was fabricated using natural loofah sponge in comparison to polyurethane carrier after employing loofah sponge in icpb the tetracycline hydrochloride tch removal rate was increased by 6 6 the mineralization was increased by 9 2 and almost all photocatalytic products were degraded compared with conventional catalyst coating strategies our powder spraying method enables the exterior surface of biocarrier to be firmly coated by the photocatalyst while the inside of biocarrier was extremely clean to accumulate bacteria the biocarrier provided a higher loading density and a higher microbial activity of bacteria than that of polyurethane carrier besides it can regulate the bacterial community to have more favorable members to biodegrade the photocatalysis intermediates in summary using loofah sponge as biocarrier could be an effective approach for enhancing the

ratio 1 introduction the water environmental concern is one of the most important global challenges along with the industrialization and urbanization growing across the world today 1 4 intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb is a novel wastewater treatment technique that has potential applications in refractory degradation 5 8 for an icpb system it is ideal to coat photocatalyst on the exterior surface of carrier while keeping the inside of carrier available and clean to load bacteria 9 in this case the photocatalytic products on the exterior carrier could diffuse into the interior carrier and be immediately biodegraded by the internal bacteria 9 10 nevertheless current photocatalyst coating strategies such as low temperature sintering and sol gel methods not only load photocatalysts on the exterior carrier but also allow the interior carrier loaded by photocatalysts which could limit the accumulation of bacteria on the interior carrier due to the attack of free radicals generated from photocatalysis 5 11 13 besides poor catalysts stability of loaded photocatalysts and poor biocompatibility of polyurethane carrier to bacteria also limit the practical application of icpb 14 to make the icpb more applicable and more efficient in wastewater treatment the above mentioned defects must be overcome in our previous work we used glue sticking and powder spraying method to coat photocatalysts to the exterior surface of carrier 15 which not only keeps the interior surface of carrier clean to accumulate bacteria but also provides a more stable photocatalyst loading than any other conventional catalyst coating method nevertheless the polyurethane carrier commonly used for icpb have poor compatibility with bacteria due to the toxicity of 2 4 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dnt used in the polyurethane production 16 to overcome this weakness carriers with better biocompatibility and hence higher bacteria accumulation and activity are required biocompatible and naturally available biomass materials provide a potential alternative for icpb carrier loofah sponges derived from fully ripened fruit of loofah plants are very low cost and easy obtained biomass material in china and southeast asia 17 and they have been widely used for bath or kitchen cleaning due to their soft texture and high water uptake capability since loofah sponges possess a natural 3d macroporous structure similar to that of synthetic sponge and are sustainable and renewable resource we consider them a suitable biocarrier for icpb 18 19 in this study we investigate the application of loofah sponge as carriers in icpb process for the first time the bi24o31br10 was chosen as the photocatalyst for our experiment as it is inexpensive and highly efficient visible light responsive photocatalyst 20 we coated loofah sponge with bi24o31br10 photocatalyst and then immersed them in the un acclimated activated sludge to cultivate the biofilms inside loofah sponge fig 1 the removal and mineralization of tetracycline hydrochloride tch was evaluated by a visible light induced icpb called vpcb system the effects of carriers including biocarriers and polyurethane carriers exerted on the survival of biofilms and the evolution of bacteria community are investigated the results show that in comparison to the conventional polyurethane sponge the biocarrier of loofah sponge shows favorable effect on microorganism accumulation bacterial community regulation as well as final performance of icpb 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of photocatalyst to prepare bi24o31br10 bi no3 3 5h2o 99 0 sinopharm group co ltd china and nh4br 99 0 sinopharm group co ltd china were used as the source of bi and br respectively the detailed preparation method and characterization of bi24o31br10 text s1 s2 and figure s2 were illustrated in the supplementary information 2 2 carrier and bi24o31br10 coating procedure the loofah sponge was collected from the nearby farm and washed with distilled water and then cut into cubes with size of approximately 1 0 cm 1 0 cm 1 0 cm according to sem images of uncoated loofah sponge the range of macropore size was between 300 and 800 μm the coating procedure was performed according to our previous publication 15 in a typical experiment 4 0 g of blank cubes were dipped into a polyurethane waterproof coating jingfu co ltd shanghai china which makes the external surface evenly coated with polyurethane waterproof coating then 1 0 g of bi24o31br10 catalysts were sprayed onto the exterior of the cubes by a spray bottle the loofah sponge cubes were then dried at 60 c and rinsed with distilled water to remove the unbounded bi24o31br10 subsequently similarly polyurethane sponge cubes were prepared using the same route 2 3 experimental setup biofilms were cultivated on bi24o31br10 coated biocarriers following the procedures summarized in the text s3 tch degradation was carried out in an airlift driven reactor with a plexiglas internal loop and a working volume of 540 ml figure s1 shows the experimental setup configuration and text s4 descripts corresponding size details air was supplied to the internal loop of the reactor by a 35 w aeration pump sobo weifang china a 300 w xenon lamp perfectlight beijing with a wavelength range of 420 800 nm was placed vertically 15 cm from the top of the reactor the light

c22h24n2o8 hcl 98 sigma aldrich co llc tch solution with concentration of 30 mg l were prepared the experiment tests on photocatalyst and biofilm coated loofah sponge carriers and polyurethane sponge carriers under illumination are denoted as vpc b l and vpc b p respectively the degradations were also operated with photocatalyst and biofilm coated carriers under dark which are labeled b l and b p respectively the reactions operated on carriers with photocatalyst only are called vpc l and vpc p respectively the reactions operated with photocatalyst coated carriers without biofilm and light were also performed these adsorption experiments are called ad l and ad p respectively besides the influence of photolysis p of tch had to be taken into consideration 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of tch was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and the degradation products of tch were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms the details have been described in text s5 the total organic carbon toc was determined using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan prior to analysis each sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter so the measured toc was assumed to be dissolved organic carbon doc 2 6 scanning microscopy observation pretreated procedure for carrier microstructure observation by scanning electron microscopy sem and the biofilm staining procedure for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm imaging are presented in the text s6 and text s7 respectively 2 7 eps and dha analysis the extracellular polymeric substance eps was extracted using the ultrasound methods firstly the spent carriers were soaked into 20 ml deionized water and shaken for 2 min in a 50 ml flask then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c to collect the biofilm solution from carrier after degradation test secondly the same volume of phosphate buffered saline pbs was added into the collected biofilm solution and then ultrasonically treated for 4 min at 4 c to obtain the eps finally the mixed solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min under 4 c and then filtrated through 0 22 μm organic membrane to obtain the sample for eps concentration analysis folin phenol reagent was used to determine the protein concentrations with folin phenol kit sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china according to the manufacturer

of vpcb for tch degradation sem images show the universal and the zoom in views of the loofah sponge exterior before and after bi24o31br10 coating which exhibits the macropores with size of 200 μm 500 μm and bone structure fig 2 before photocatalyst coating the bone surface of exterior loofah sponge was clean fig 2b while after photocatalyst coating the bone surface was completely covered by the bi24o31br10 fig 2d since the photocatalyst coating did not block the macroporous structure of the loofah sponge fig 2c bi24o31br10 coated carriers can be used for further biofilm cultivation macropores on the carriers provide accesses for microbial migration from the exterior into the interior section of loofah sponge meanwhile the bones especially the interior bones provide sites for biofilm attachment and growth fig 3 shows the exterior and interior of bi24o31br10 coated carriers after biofilm cultivation photocatalysts were mainly observed on the exterior surface of loofah sponge due to our spray coating strategy 15 short rod bacteria were mainly bound to the interior of loofah sponges fig 3b few bacteria were observed on the exterior surface of loofah sponge fig 3a likely because the photocatalysts coated on the exterior were poison to bacteria which suppress the bacteria attachment and growth after vpc b l operation the bacteria on the interior was still well attached fig 3d while the biofilm on the exterior reduced to some degree due to the photocatalysis induced damage fig 3c all phenomena were typical characteristic of vpcb confirming the successful fabrication of vpc b l the same phenomena also occurred in the vpcb p system but the bacterial loading density on the polyurethane carriers was significantly lower than that of the biocarrier figure s3 which may be due to the smaller pore size 100 500 μm and lower hydrophilicity of the polyurethane sponge compared to the loofah sponge figure s4 3 2 enhancing tch removal and mineralization for the degradation test the results of different protocols are shown in fig 4 a tch was not degraded by visible light photolysis p for the absorption performance the tch concentration rapidly decreased during the first 2 h then maintained steady at the removal rate of 21 4 and 31 1 of ad l and ad p respectively the higher adsorption efficiency of polyurethane carrier is likely attributed to its higher specific surface areas 2 3 m2 g protocols b and ad showed similar declines which means that tch losses in b were due to adsorption not biodegradation the tch removal rates of vpc l and vpc p reached 54 7 and 64 0 respectively indicating that the bi24o31br10 were highly efficient for tch photocatalytic degradation the higher tch removal rates of vpc p was likely due to the higher adsorption efficiency of polyurethane carrier ad p ad l fig 4a the vpcb protocols showed more efficient tch removal capabilities than vpc alone in the first 1 5 h tch concentration rapidly decreased because of carrier adsorption while between 1 5 h 8 h the residual tch was removed through vpcb at mild rates after 8 h vpc b l and vpcb p showed tch removal rates of 89 0 and 82 4 respectively biodegradation accelerated tch degradation and enhanced the final tch removal rate by 34 3 and 18 4 higher for vpc b l and vpcb p than corresponding vpc protocols this result indicates that the biocarrier showed higher biodegradation efficiency than polyurethane carrier in this way the intermediates obtained from photocatalysis can be biodegraded more rapidly which reducing the competition with tch for free radicals i e photocatalytic free radicals of vpc b l could attack tch more efficiently than vpc l 5 additional four vpc b l tests with 8 h for each cycle were carried out to evaluate the reusability of the biocarrier for tch degradation figure s5 at the end of the 1 st 2nd 3rd and 4th cycle 87 4 86 8 86 3 and 85 2 of tch were removed by the vpc b l protocol this suggests that vpc b l can maintain stable and good performance after long time running in order to further investigate the degradation performance of vpc b l the dissolved organic carbon doc in the spent liquid was measured as shown in fig 4b comparing with vpcb p nearly more than 9 2 doc was further removed after using vpcb l the extra removal of doc should be attributed to the better biodegradation of loofah sponge which provides biocompatible environment for bacteria loading and growth 3 3 tch degradation pathways uplc ms techniques were performed to identify the intermediates of tch figure s6 and possible pathways for tch degradation fig 5 were elucidated based on mass spectrometry the initial products with m z of 461 417 and 340 were formed through the hydroxylation nc bond cleavage and deamination of tch respectively 5 10 subsequent products with m z of 434 and 476 were produced from the product with an m z of 461 via demethylation hydroxylation respectively the product with an m z of 373 was produced from the product with m z of 417 by hydroxyl radical attack and deamination after vpc the above mentioned 4 ring products can be detected suggesting that the photocatalysis can only degrade tch without ring opening most of tch s 4 ringed molecular structures were destroyed after vpcb ultimately after vpcb p protocol only one ring and ring opening residuals with m z values of 184 and 144 were obtained when vpcb l was applied the products with m z values of 184 disappeared and products with smaller m z values of 114 were obtained this suggests that the aromatic compound was totally degraded at the end of the vpcb l protocol and the biocarrier provided higher biodegradation degree than polyurethane carrier the removal of aromatic compounds in vpcb p and vpcb l reveals that the biodegradation of intermediates could reduce the consumption of free radicals generated from photocatalysis hence keep more free radicals available for tch degradation 3 4 enhanced microbial survival and activity 3 4 1 microbial dha because dhas are the mainly enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway converting glucose to pyruvate dha activities are widely used to represent microbial activity 22 dha levels gradually decreased in all vpcb protocols during operation fig 6 the final dha content of vpcb l was approximately 67 of the initial level the dha in vpcb p decreased to a greater extent than that in the vpcb l protocol and the dha content was reduced to 40 of the initial dha level this suggests that the polyurethane sponge substantially suppressed microbial activity during vpcb while the biocarrier exert much less suppressing effect on the dehydrogenase activity 3 4 2 microbial eps and living dead cell distribution the production of eps during endogenous respiration affects the bioactivities of bacteria 23 the initial concentration of eps containing polysaccharides and proteins where protein was the major component was similar in the vpcb l and vpcb p protocols fig 7 as the degradation process progressed the eps concentration in both protocols showed same variation trends with polysaccharides and proteins content both increase at 4 h degradation and decrease between 4 h and 8 h degradation time the increment in eps concentration is due to the exposure of biofilms to toxic environments 23 which allow the biofilms secrete a large amount of eps from self regulation and self protection the decrease of eps concentration at 8 h is due to the endogenous respiration of bacteria which use the eps as food supply for bio consumption 24 in comparison to the vpcb l vpcb p protocol showed a more significant increase in the eps concentration fig 4a suggesting that the polyurethane carrier shows a more severe bio inhibitory effect than loofah carrier ros is another harsh environmental factor influencing microorganisms growth whereas we consider their impact on eps secretion is quite minimal because the diffusion of ros from exterior of loofah sponge where photocatalyst loads to interior is quite difficulty which makes the attack of ros to microorganisms really hard 14 the distribution of living cells and dead cells on the spent carriers after experiment is shown in figure s7 for vpcb p the dead bacteria exhibited a uniform distribution on exterior and interior of carrier while the bacteria death on exterior was more severe figure s7c and d in case of vpcb l a higher bacterial loading density is observed on biocarrier than that on polyurethane carrier of vpcb p confirming the superior environment of loofah sponge than polyurethane carrier for bacteria loading and growth in comparison to the interior of biocarrier the exterior showed a wider microbial death zone this is because the exterior possess much high loading of photocatalysts than the interior which allow more ros attack to bacteria there figure s7a and b 3 5 functionalized microbial community biofilms were collected to study the biotransformation that occurred during the degradation of tch in the vpcb systems the microbial community transformation analysis revealed that the bacterial community was regulated after degradation process figure s8 prior to tch degradation raw the dominant classes were grammaproteobacteria and bacteroidia which are typical microbial groups in biological wastewater treatment processes 25 while grammaproteobacteria declined significantly after tch degradation bacteroidia became more abundant in the vpcb systems bacteroidia are well known for scavenging a wide range of organic substrates including aromatics 26 the abundance of deltaproteobacteria known to harbor phenylide resistant gene 27 was higher in vpcb p system than in vpcb l system indicating that a large amount of phenylide was present in vpcb p system the heat map clearly displays the evolution of the bacterial community at the genus level fig 8 members of hydrogenophaga 10 sphingobacterium 7 and terrimonas which are gram negative genus common in activated sludge were dominant in the biofilms cultivated on the carriers raw after tch degradation bacteriovorax and formivibrio and paludibacter which are capable of degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were more abundant in vpcb l system than in vpcb p system 5 the flourishing of these genus in vpcb l illustrates that biocarrier is more susceptible to the regulation of the formation of functional microbial groups for the degradation of tch and the mineralization of byproducts in addition the emerging christensenellaceae thauera fibrobacter desulfobulbus sulfobacillus desulfobulbus cupriavidus and salinispira genera whose abundance is known to be positively correlated with the concentration of phenylide and cyanide 16 enriched in vpcb p operation the genus capable of removing aromatic hydrocarbons was significantly decreased and the genus harboring the benzene resistant gene became more abundant in vpcb p system indicating the toxicity of the polyurethane carrier to most functional microbial communities 3 6 summary the application of loofah sponges as a biocarrier in the icpb process are first reported by this work we found that biocarrier offered obvious advantages over polyurethane carrier first the loofah sponges are naturally available and abundant second loofah sponges are non toxic to bacteria which can provide a higher bacterial loading density for vpcb system figure s7 third loofah sponges play a key role in increasing microbial activity keeping bacterial metabolism more stable fig 7 fourth the microbial community on the loofah sponges can be optimized and the genus of the biodegradable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be more abundant fig 8 all of these effects work together in vpcb contributing to an enhanced tch removal rate and more complete mineralization 4 conclusions loofah sponge a simple cost effective and green biocarrier was first reported as an icpb carrier in our work in comparison to conventional polyurethane carriers the biocarriers could promote the tch removal rate and the mineralization degree by 6 6 and 9 2 respectively the loofah sponges could provide a higher loading density and a higher microbial activity of bacteria than that of polyurethane carriers besides it can regulate the bacterial community to have more favorable members to biodegrade the photocatalysis intermediates in this case using loofah sponges as carriers could be an effective approach for enhancing the biodegradation performance of icpb declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations
