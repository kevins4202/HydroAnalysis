containing penicillin g png was subjected to adsorption for 20 min followed by photodegradation for 200 min to optimize the treatment method the png removal efficiencies of the adsorption and photodegradation processes were measured under different experimental conditions and it was determined that the increase in feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticle concentration from 0 005 to 1 g l favored adsorption but hindered photodegradation as png removal efficiency noticeably decreased after increasing the catalyst concentration beyond 0 01 g l the results revealed that a png removal efficiency of 100 could be achieved after 220 min of successive adsorption and photodegradation at a ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 g l png concentration of 10 mg l and h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l analysis of the png photodegradation mechanism demonstrated that the superoxide anion radicals generated during photodegradation played a major role in png degradation feni3 sio2 zno is a sustainable adsorbent catalyst because it can be reused for six consecutive treatment cycles with minor losses in efficiency 3 and quantity 1 our results indicated that the prepared feni3 sio2 zno

rate of pharmaceutical compounds 1 however in many countries the generated wastewater is subjected to inefficient treatments which presents catastrophic consequences for water quality 2 3 antibiotics are classified as hazardous compounds that can be harmful for human health and are among the most common pollutants released at high concentrations in wastewater from pharmaceutical factories 4 in addition noticeable quantities of residual or partially metabolized antibiotics which account for approximately 30 90 of the total amounts ingested by animals and humans have been detected in municipal and veterinary wastewater 5 7 moreover once antibiotics are released into the environment they may be degraded to carcinogenic compounds 8 in addition antibiotics can poison algae and other aquatic organisms resulting in long term damage to aquatic life and ecosystems 9 10 therefore removing antibiotics is an important goal of wastewater treatment plants penicillin g c16h17n2nao4s png which is a β lactam antibiotic is commonly used for the treatment of moderately severe to severe bacterial infections 11 png stops the growth of pathological bacteria in the body and its widespread use is attributed to its efficiency in treating numerous bacterial infections and its affordability 11 it is estimated that more than 20 000 tons year of png is produced worldwide furthermore u s png consumption between 2010 and 2011 amounted to 44 of the total png manufactured quantity 12 13 the chemical structure of the png molecule is presented in fig 1 2 12 14 to date several methods have been used for the treatment of organic pollutant containing wastewater including adsorption 15 ozonation 16 electrochemical oxidation 17 electrocoagulation 18 membrane filtration 19 and photodegradation 6 photodegradation is one of the most advanced oxidation treatment processes that uses light energy and metal oxides as catalysts for pollutant degradation recently photodegradation has attracted increasing attention because of its facile application low cost stability and capability to degrade antibiotic molecules to nonhazardous byproducts such as h2o and co2 20 furthermore sunlight induced photodegradation is a modern green and promising wastewater treatment technique 21 22 photodegradation consist of the conversion of light energy into chemical energy 22 when photon energy is greater than or equal to the catalyst band gap the electrons in the valence band of the catalyst are excited to the conduction band and holes are generated in the conduction band the excited electrons and generated holes can directly or indirectly produce hydroxyl radicals o h which can easily degrade organic matter or convert it into minerals 23 as photodegradation is a sensitive process the catalyst material should be carefully selected semiconductors have attracted increasing attention as effective and economical catalysts for organic pollutant degradation 22 among semiconductors zno nanoparticles have attracted the attention of researchers as photodegradation catalysts zno is readily available and absorbs a larger fraction of the solar spectrum therefore its photodegradation activity is high 23 because zno nanoparticles are small separating them after wastewater treatment requires an additional advanced separation method such as nanofiltration however it is difficult to use conventional separation methods such as settling and centrifugation for large scale applications because they are time consuming and present economic and technical limitations this is a drawback for the use of zno nanoparticles alone for photodegradation therefore it is important to develop an effective and economical method for separating photodegradation catalyst nanoparticles from purified water as such magnetic separation using magnetite particles has gained increasing attention zno nanoparticles can be coated onto magnetic nanoparticles which facilitates their separation using magnets 22 24 for example feni3 magnetic nanoparticles are optimal for this purpose because they present high electromagnetism and are non toxic 25 however feni3 magnetic nanoparticles used for photodegradation can be destroyed by light exposure and photocatalytic reaction byproducts therefore the addition of an external layer to protect feni3 is important and sio2 particles which can be easily prepared and used and present good compatibility with many materials are promising for this purpose khodadadi et al 2019 studied the degradation efficiency of tetracycline using feni3 sio2 nanoparticles as the catalyst for the heterogeneous fenton like process their results revealed that the feni3 sio2 catalyst presented excellent catalytic activity for efficient and environmentally friendly degradation of tetracycline 26 bazrafshan et al 2019 analyzed the photocatalytic degradation ability of zno nanoparticles for catechol and achieved a catechol degradation efficiency of 69 8 under optimized conditions furthermore the prepared zno nanoparticles presented unique catalytic features 27 nasseh et al 2020 comprehensively studied the photodegradation performance of feni3 sio2 zno for tamoxifen in the laboratory using simulated sunlight their results indicated that feni3 sio2 zno presented a high tamoxifen degradation efficiency and degradation was an environmentally friendly and sustainable process 28 despite feni3 sio2 and zno nanoparticles being used for photodegradation of pharmaceutical compound laden wastewater the adsorptive and degradation abilities of these nanoparticles for penicillin g have not been investigated yet therefore in this study feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were used for the first time for png removal from wastewater via adsorption and photodegradation in addition we analyzed the effects of ph concentration of feni3 sio2 zno initial png concentration concentration of h2o2 and photodegradation reaction time on png removal efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and devices the following chemicals were purchased from merck and were used to synthesize feni3 sio2 zno polyethylene glycol iron chloride tetrahydrate nickel chloride hexahydrate hydrazine monohydrate ammonia tetraethyl orthosilicate dimethylformamide zinc nitrate hexahydrate hcl and naoh in addition png powder 99 purity molar mass 334 4 g mol and pka 2 6 was acquired from sigma aldrich and was used to prepare the png working solutions using distilled water the main instruments used in this study were as follows a unico2150 unico ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer which was used to measure png concentration xenon lamp with a 420 nm filter philips which was used as a simulated sunlight emitter a dc 180 froilabo magnetic stirrer which was used to mix reactants an fr usc 22 lq intellect ultrasonic bath which was used to disperse nanoparticles in aqueous solutions a 5800 eppendorf centrifuge which was used for liquid solid separation and a calimatic knick ph meter which was used to measure the ph of the working solutions 2 2 preparation of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were synthesized using coprecipitation and sol gel methods as described in detail in our previously published papers 28 29 the schematic diagram of the experimental procedure for the synthesis of feni3 feni3 sio and feni3 sio zno nanoparticles is illustrated in fig 2 the notation material a material b is typically used to indicate core shell structures in which material a is completely covered by material b transmission electron microscopy analysis has been previously used to confirm that the prepared nanoparticles presented core shell structure 28 29 the point of zero charge phpzc of feni3 sio2 zno was determined as this parameter is important for identifying changes in the surface charge of catalysts as a function of solution ph for this six erlenmeyer flasks were filled with 100 ml of a preprepared 0 01 m nacl solution the initial ph of the nacl solution was adjusted and it ranged from 2 to 12 thereafter 0 2 g of synthesized feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles was added to each flask followed by shaking at 350 rpm for 48 h lastly the initial and final ph values in each flask were plotted in the same graph and phpzc was determined from the intersection of the plots 2 3 adsorption and photodegradation experiments png photodegradation experiments were conducted in a batch system using 500 ml quartz flasks filled with 100 ml of a png solution png photodegradation reactions were performed at 25 c and a mixing speed at 350 rpm to ensure complete mixing of the catalyst particles with the png contaminated solution prior to photodegradation the prepared png feni3 sio2 zno mixtures were maintained in the dark for 20 min for the adsorption reaction 30 this is important to account for the fraction of png that removed via adsorption onto feni3 sio2 zno the adsorption duration was adopted based on similar previous studies which demonstrated that 20 min was the adequate time for the adsorbent adsorbate mixture to reach equilibrium 26 28 subsequently photodegradation was initiated by switching on the xenon lamp the photodegradation of png using feni3 sio2 zno was performed for 200 min during the photodegradation experiments the flasks were only exposed to the light generated by the xenon lamp samples 2 ml were collected from each flask at predetermined times 10 0 5 10 15 30 60 90 120 180 200 min and the residual feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were separated from the samples via centrifugation at 5000 rpm and magnetic separation the absorbance intensity of png was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 290 nm 3 the png concentration was determined from the predetermined relationship between the recorded absorbance and png concentration and the png removal efficiency of the adsorption and photodegradation processes was determined as follows 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n r e s i d u a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 100 where i n i t i a l and r e s i d u a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n s are the initial and residual png concentrations in the aqueous solution at the sampling time respectively in this study the png degradation efficiency of feni3 sio2 zno was determined under different conditions namely a ph range of 3 10 feni3 sio2 zno concentration range of 0 001 1 g l initial png concentration range of 10 60 mg l and h2o2 concentration range of 50 200 mg l the photodegradation reaction time was 200 min for all experiments all spectrophotometric measurements were performed in duplicate for each png sample and the average values were used for calculations for the study of the initial png concentration on png degradation efficiency the aforementioned initial png concentration range corresponded to the approximate residual png concentrations in aqueous solutions measured using the uv vis spectrophotometer after adsorption in the dark 3 results and discussion 3 1 png removal efficiency under different experimental conditions 3 1 1 effect of ph on png removal efficiency solution ph can affect both adsorption and photodegradation mechanisms as ph affects the surface charge of the adsorbent and generation rate of reactive radicals in aqueous solution the removal efficiency of png via adsorption and photodegradation using feni3 sio2 zno at different solution ph levels in the range of 3 10 is presented in fig 3 the highest png removal efficiency of 89 3 was achieved under the following conditions ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 05 g l png concentration of 40 mg l total adsorption and photodegradation reaction time of 220 min and h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l the of high png removal efficiency recorded at ph 5 was attributed to the difference between the surface charge of feni3 sio2 zno and the charge of png molecules at this ph the phpzc of feni3 sio2 zno has been previously determined to be 6 5 therefore the surface of the feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles was saturated with negative charges when the solution ph was higher than 6 5 and was positively charged at lower ph values 30 31 conversely the pka of png molecules is 2 75 therefore png was anionic at ph 5 32 consequently the electrostatic attraction between feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles and png molecules was strong at ph 5 the strong electrostatic attraction led to high adsorption and photodegradation png removal rates in addition at acidic ph h ions converted to h radicals the increase in number of h radicals in the aqueous png solution and on the feni3 sio2 zno surface increased the degradation capacity of the catalyst which increased png photodegradation rate hence it was concluded that feni3 sio2 zno presented high png removal efficiency in aqueous solutions under slightly acidic conditions the highest png removal efficiency at a ph of approximately 5 has also been reported by other researchers who investigated the photodegradation of png using cofe2o4 cus and persulfate catalysts 3 6 in contrast zhang et al 33 reported a high photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue dye using pvdf go zno under alkaline conditions this discrepancy was attributed to the nature of the catalyst phpzc and pollutant pka therefore it was concluded that the strength of the electrostatic attraction between catalyst particles and pollutant molecules plays a significant role in adsorption and photodegradation removal processes 3 1 2 effect of feni3 sio2 zno concentration on png removal efficiency the png adsorption and photodegradation abilities of feni3 sio2 zno were analyzed at different feni3 sio2 zno concentrations the experiments were performed at a ph of 5 png concentration of 10 mg l h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l and total adsorption and photodegradation reaction time of 220 min and the results are illustrated in fig 4 to distinguish the photodegradation results from the adsorption results the adsorption data were plotted in the reaction time range of 20 to 0 min fig 4 which corresponded to the adsorption time interval of 0 20 min the png adsorption removal efficiency increased with increasing feni3 sio2 zno concentration whereas the png photodegradation removal efficiency presented an opposite trend this behavior was ascribed to the mechanisms of the pollutant removal processes in this study adsorption mainly depends on the number of sorption sites which is determined by the concentration of adsorbent in solution an increase in number of adsorption sites leads to an increase in png removal efficiency and vice versa 34 for photodegradation increasing the concentration of feni3 sio2 zno from 0 005 to 0 01 g l increased png removal efficiency whereas a further increase in feni3 sio2 zno concentration beyond 0 01 g l hindered png removal the increase in png removal efficiency with feni3 sio2 zno concentration in the range of 0 005 0 01 g l was attributed to the formation of active sites via photon absorption which led to the increase in number of active sites with increasing feni3 sio2 zno concentration and the increase in png photodegradation rate 13 however png removal efficiency decreased by half as the feni3 sio2 zno concentration increased from 0 01 to 0 5 g l this was ascribed to the increase in turbidity with increasing feni3 sio2 zno concentration 6 the increase in turbidity blocked light from penetrating the contaminated solution and eventually hindered photodegradation and free radical production similar results were reported by mohammed et al 2020 35 and elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 36 who studied the adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics respectively our results revealed that a png removal efficiency of 100 can be achieved at a feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 g l 3 1 3 effect of initial png concentration on png removal efficiency to investigate the efficacy of feni3 sio2 zno for png removal at different initial png concentrations we used png concentrations in the range of 10 60 mg l fig 5 the other experimental conditions were as follows ph 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 mg l h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l and total adsorption and photodegradation reaction time of 220 min the removal efficiency curves presented similar profiles at all analyzed png concentrations in other words png removal efficiency decreased gradually with increasing png concentration these results were ascribed to the quantity of feni3 sio2 zno used for all experiments being the same regardless of png concentration consequently the number of reaction sites was the same however the number of png molecules in solution increased with increasing initial png concentration therefore an increasing number of png molecules competed for the same number of available reaction sites this led to png molecules blocking light from directly penetrating catalyst particles which limited the rate of the radical generating photodegradation reactions this phenomenon was described in detail by zhang et al 2019 33 who reported that methylene blue dye degradation efficiency decreased with increasing methylene blue dye concentration from 10 to 30 mg l because light absorption rate decreased 33 in addition khalil et al 2019 reported that ibuprofen removal efficiency under visible light irradiation decreased with increasing ibuprofen concentration under visible light irradiation 37 3 1 4 effect of h2o2 concentration on png removal efficiency to study the effect of h2o2 concentration on png removal efficiency we used h2o2 concentrations in the range of 50 200 mg l the other experimental conditions were as follows a ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 mg l png concentration of 10 mg l and photodegradation reaction time of 200 min the experimental data are presented in fig 6 the data for the adsorption process are not included as the addition of h2o2 oxidant only affected the photodegradation process png removal efficiency increased with increasing h2o2 concentration this was attributed to the increase in number of generated o h radicals which are strong organic matter oxidants and improved png photodegradation 38 by contrast png photodegradation was fast as png removal rate increased to 72 after the first 5 min of reaction this was attributed to the increase in time required to produce more active o h radicals in addition as the reaction time increased the active o h radicals could react with and attack the png molecules in aqueous solution 39 40 png photodegradation efficiency did not change significantly with increasing h2o2 concentration from 150 to 200 mg l therefore the addition of 150 mg l h2o2 was adequate to the oxide at a png concentration of 10 mg l in addition the data in figs 4 6 suggest that under the experimental conditions in this study a png photodegradation efficiency of 100 can be achieved after 200 min therefore the png removal method used in this study is suitable for png loaded wastewater treatment 3 2 photodegradation kinetics to study the kinetics of the png photodegradation over feni3 sio2 zno the experimental png photodegradation removal data were modeled using a pseudo first order model as described by eq 2 28 41 2 ln c 0 c t k o b s t where c 0 g l and c t g l are the initial png concentration and residual png concentration at the sampling time kobs min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and t is the photodegradation time min this was achieved by plotting the png photodegradation data in fig 5 namely ln c 0 c t as a function of t in the range of 0 200 min table 1 summarizes the kobs values and the regression coefficients r2 of the linear plot equations the reaction half time which is a critical reaction parameter is also listed in table 1 the r2 values of the png photodegradation reaction curves at different png concentrations were high this indicated that png photodegradation over feni3 sio2 zno followed a pseudo first order kinetic model the k obs values decreased with increasing initial png concentration this indicated that png removal efficiency decreased with increasing png concentration which was in agreement with the experimental results reported in section 3 1 3 regarding the effect of png initial concentration on png removal efficiency 3 3 mechanism of png photodegradation photodegradation was the main png removal process and its mechanism was comprehensively examined in this study the mechanism of photodegradation reactions over semiconductor catalysts involves light or photon energy absorption at the semiconductor surface which leads to surface excitation the key factor during this process is the distance between non overlapping semiconductor energy levels therefore photon excitation causes transfer of electrons from the highest occupied capacitance level to the nearest unoccupied conduction level and the difference in energy between these levels is known as the band gap if photon energy is equal to or greater than the band gap the electrons become excited and electron hole pairs form in the semiconductor 42 the electrons generated move to the semiconductor surface to participate in oxidation reduction reactions with the compounds adsorbed on the surface photodegradation to remove pollutants begins with the absorption of uv radiation and the creation of electron hole pairs the generated holes move to the catalyst surface interact with the water molecules adsorbed on the surface and form o h radicals subsequently the o h radicals and holes oxidize the organic molecules near the catalyst surface in addition to the direct interaction between holes and organic molecules holes can indirectly participate in degradation by oxidizing water molecules and producing o h radicals with high oxidation ability toward organic matter 43 for sio2 a small number of holes are trapped by oxygen which weakens the si o bonds however the electrons in the conduction band of sio2 participate in png decomposition reactions therefore electrons typically interact with oxygen in water producing superoxide anion radicals eventually the produced superoxide anion radicals participate in photodegradation reactions by opening the rings of organic substances such as png 44 45 the schematic diagram of the png photodegradation mechanism is presented in fig 7 3 4 regeneration test of feni3 sio2 zno the reusability of materials used for wastewater treatment is important the adsorbents or catalysts used for hazardous pollutant removal can combine with the pollutants and eventually become hazardous solid waste which increases the overall treatment cost therefore using potentially reusable treatment agents eliminates hazardous waste generation and increases the sustainability value of the treatment agents which reduces treatment cost hcl 0 5 m can oxidize the png molecules adsorbed on the surface of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles therefore the feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles used for each png adsorption photodegradation cycle were regenerated using the following steps i separation from aqueous solution using a magnet ii washing with hcl followed by washing with deionized water iii oven drying and iv reusing for the next treatment cycle under the following experimental conditions ph of 5 png concentration of 10 mg l feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 mg l h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l and total adsorption and photodegradation time of 220 min the experimental results indicated that the feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles can be successfully recycled six times with a negligible decrease in png removal efficiency 3 fig 8 in addition the original quantity of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles only decreased by 0 93 after six adsorption photodegradation cycles and corresponding regeneration tests which can greatly reduce wastewater treatment cost the decrease in quantity of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles may be highlighted in the successive separation processes performed by using a magnet in summary the properties of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles reported herein suggest that feni3 sio2 zno can be a sustainable wastewater treatment agent with great practical application prospects 4 conclusion in this study feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were prepared and used to remove png from wastewater via adsorption and photodegradation the treatment consisted of 20 min of adsorption followed by 200 min of photodegradation the results revealed that feni3 sio2 zno presented high adsorptive and catalytic abilities for png removal we determined that a removal efficiency of png of 100 at an initial png concentration of 10 mg l could be achieved under the following experimental conditions ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 g l and h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l the kinetics of the degradation reaction were also studied and it was determined that photodegradation could be mathematically represented using a pseudo first order kinetic model moreover feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were an economical treatment agent as they were recycled six times with minor losses in png removal efficiency 3 and quantity 1 of the original quantity in summary we concluded that adsorption followed by photodegradation using feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles as the adsorbent and catalyst and under sunlight irradiation can be an efficient treatment method for the economical safe and environmentally friendly removal of png from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments we would like to thank the research and

v a l e f f i c i e n c y i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n r e s i d u a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 100 where i n i t i a l and r e s i d u a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n s are the initial and residual png concentrations in the aqueous solution at the sampling time respectively in this study the png degradation efficiency of feni3 sio2 zno was determined under different conditions namely a ph range of 3 10 feni3 sio2 zno concentration range of 0 001 1 g l initial png concentration range of 10 60 mg l and h2o2 concentration range of 50 200 mg l the photodegradation reaction time was 200 min for all experiments all spectrophotometric measurements were performed in duplicate for each png sample and the average values were used for calculations for the study of the initial png concentration on png degradation efficiency the aforementioned initial png concentration range corresponded to the approximate residual png concentrations in aqueous solutions measured using the uv vis spectrophotometer after adsorption in the dark 3 results and discussion 3 1 png removal efficiency under different experimental conditions 3 1 1 effect of ph on png removal efficiency solution ph can affect both adsorption and photodegradation mechanisms as ph affects the surface charge of the adsorbent and generation rate of reactive radicals in aqueous solution the removal efficiency of png via adsorption and photodegradation using feni3 sio2 zno at different solution ph levels in the range of 3 10 is presented in fig 3 the highest png removal efficiency of 89 3 was achieved under the following conditions ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 05 g l png concentration of 40 mg l total adsorption and photodegradation reaction time of 220 min and h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l the of high png removal efficiency recorded at ph 5 was attributed to the difference between the surface charge of feni3 sio2 zno and the charge of png molecules at this ph the phpzc of feni3 sio2 zno has been previously determined to be 6 5 therefore the surface of the feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles was saturated with negative charges when the solution ph was higher than 6 5 and was positively charged at lower ph values 30 31 conversely the pka of png molecules is 2 75 therefore png was anionic at ph 5 32 consequently the electrostatic attraction between feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles and png molecules was strong at ph 5 the strong electrostatic attraction led to high adsorption and photodegradation png removal rates in addition at acidic ph h ions converted to h radicals the increase in number of h radicals in the aqueous png solution and on the feni3 sio2 zno surface increased the degradation capacity of the catalyst which increased png photodegradation rate hence it was concluded that feni3 sio2 zno presented high png removal efficiency in aqueous solutions under slightly acidic conditions the highest png removal efficiency at a ph of approximately 5 has also been reported by other researchers who investigated the photodegradation of png using cofe2o4 cus and persulfate catalysts 3 6 in contrast zhang et al 33 reported a high photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue dye using pvdf go zno under alkaline conditions this discrepancy was attributed to the nature of the catalyst phpzc and pollutant pka therefore it was concluded that the strength of the electrostatic attraction between catalyst particles and pollutant molecules plays a significant role in adsorption and photodegradation removal processes 3 1 2 effect of feni3 sio2 zno concentration on png removal efficiency the png adsorption and photodegradation abilities of feni3 sio2 zno were analyzed at different feni3 sio2 zno concentrations the experiments were performed at a ph of 5 png concentration of 10 mg l h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l and total adsorption and photodegradation reaction time of 220 min and the results are illustrated in fig 4 to distinguish the photodegradation results from the adsorption results the adsorption data were plotted in the reaction time range of 20 to 0 min fig 4 which corresponded to the adsorption time interval of 0 20 min the png adsorption removal efficiency increased with increasing feni3 sio2 zno concentration whereas the png photodegradation removal efficiency presented an opposite trend this behavior was ascribed to the mechanisms of the pollutant removal processes in this study adsorption mainly depends on the number of sorption sites which is determined by the concentration of adsorbent in solution an increase in number of adsorption sites leads to an increase in png removal efficiency and vice versa 34 for photodegradation increasing the concentration of feni3 sio2 zno from 0 005 to 0 01 g l increased png removal efficiency whereas a further increase in feni3 sio2 zno concentration beyond 0 01 g l hindered png removal the increase in png removal efficiency with feni3 sio2 zno concentration in the range of 0 005 0 01 g l was attributed to the formation of active sites via photon absorption which led to the increase in number of active sites with increasing feni3 sio2 zno concentration and the increase in png photodegradation rate 13 however png removal efficiency decreased by half as the feni3 sio2 zno concentration increased from 0 01 to 0 5 g l this was ascribed to the increase in turbidity with increasing feni3 sio2 zno concentration 6 the increase in turbidity blocked light from penetrating the contaminated solution and eventually hindered photodegradation and free radical production similar results were reported by mohammed et al 2020 35 and elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 36 who studied the adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics respectively our results revealed that a png removal efficiency of 100 can be achieved at a feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 g l 3 1 3 effect of initial png concentration on png removal efficiency to investigate the efficacy of feni3 sio2 zno for png removal at different initial png concentrations we used png concentrations in the range of 10 60 mg l fig 5 the other experimental conditions were as follows ph 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 mg l h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l and total adsorption and photodegradation reaction time of 220 min the removal efficiency curves presented similar profiles at all analyzed png concentrations in other words png removal efficiency decreased gradually with increasing png concentration these results were ascribed to the quantity of feni3 sio2 zno used for all experiments being the same regardless of png concentration consequently the number of reaction sites was the same however the number of png molecules in solution increased with increasing initial png concentration therefore an increasing number of png molecules competed for the same number of available reaction sites this led to png molecules blocking light from directly penetrating catalyst particles which limited the rate of the radical generating photodegradation reactions this phenomenon was described in detail by zhang et al 2019 33 who reported that methylene blue dye degradation efficiency decreased with increasing methylene blue dye concentration from 10 to 30 mg l because light absorption rate decreased 33 in addition khalil et al 2019 reported that ibuprofen removal efficiency under visible light irradiation decreased with increasing ibuprofen concentration under visible light irradiation 37 3 1 4 effect of h2o2 concentration on png removal efficiency to study the effect of h2o2 concentration on png removal efficiency we used h2o2 concentrations in the range of 50 200 mg l the other experimental conditions were as follows a ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 mg l png concentration of 10 mg l and photodegradation reaction time of 200 min the experimental data are presented in fig 6 the data for the adsorption process are not included as the addition of h2o2 oxidant only affected the photodegradation process png removal efficiency increased with increasing h2o2 concentration this was attributed to the increase in number of generated o h radicals which are strong organic matter oxidants and improved png photodegradation 38 by contrast png photodegradation was fast as png removal rate increased to 72 after the first 5 min of reaction this was attributed to the increase in time required to produce more active o h radicals in addition as the reaction time increased the active o h radicals could react with and attack the png molecules in aqueous solution 39 40 png photodegradation efficiency did not change significantly with increasing h2o2 concentration from 150 to 200 mg l therefore the addition of 150 mg l h2o2 was adequate to the oxide at a png concentration of 10 mg l in addition the data in figs 4 6 suggest that under the experimental conditions in this study a png photodegradation efficiency of 100 can be achieved after 200 min therefore the png removal method used in this study is suitable for png loaded wastewater treatment 3 2 photodegradation kinetics to study the kinetics of the png photodegradation over feni3 sio2 zno the experimental png photodegradation removal data were modeled using a pseudo first order model as described by eq 2 28 41 2 ln c 0 c t k o b s t where c 0 g l and c t g l are the initial png concentration and residual png concentration at the sampling time kobs min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant and t is the photodegradation time min this was achieved by plotting the png photodegradation data in fig 5 namely ln c 0 c t as a function of t in the range of 0 200 min table 1 summarizes the kobs values and the regression coefficients r2 of the linear plot equations the reaction half time which is a critical reaction parameter is also listed in table 1 the r2 values of the png photodegradation reaction curves at different png concentrations were high this indicated that png photodegradation over feni3 sio2 zno followed a pseudo first order kinetic model the k obs values decreased with increasing initial png concentration this indicated that png removal efficiency decreased with increasing png concentration which was in agreement with the experimental results reported in section 3 1 3 regarding the effect of png initial concentration on png removal efficiency 3 3 mechanism of png photodegradation photodegradation was the main png removal process and its mechanism was comprehensively examined in this study the mechanism of photodegradation reactions over semiconductor catalysts involves light or photon energy absorption at the semiconductor surface which leads to surface excitation the key factor during this process is the distance between non overlapping semiconductor energy levels therefore photon excitation causes transfer of electrons from the highest occupied capacitance level to the nearest unoccupied conduction level and the difference in energy between these levels is known as the band gap if photon energy is equal to or greater than the band gap the electrons become excited and electron hole pairs form in the semiconductor 42 the electrons generated move to the semiconductor surface to participate in oxidation reduction reactions with the compounds adsorbed on the surface photodegradation to remove pollutants begins with the absorption of uv radiation and the creation of electron hole pairs the generated holes move to the catalyst surface interact with the water molecules adsorbed on the surface and form o h radicals subsequently the o h radicals and holes oxidize the organic molecules near the catalyst surface in addition to the direct interaction between holes and organic molecules holes can indirectly participate in degradation by oxidizing water molecules and producing o h radicals with high oxidation ability toward organic matter 43 for sio2 a small number of holes are trapped by oxygen which weakens the si o bonds however the electrons in the conduction band of sio2 participate in png decomposition reactions therefore electrons typically interact with oxygen in water producing superoxide anion radicals eventually the produced superoxide anion radicals participate in photodegradation reactions by opening the rings of organic substances such as png 44 45 the schematic diagram of the png photodegradation mechanism is presented in fig 7 3 4 regeneration test of feni3 sio2 zno the reusability of materials used for wastewater treatment is important the adsorbents or catalysts used for hazardous pollutant removal can combine with the pollutants and eventually become hazardous solid waste which increases the overall treatment cost therefore using potentially reusable treatment agents eliminates hazardous waste generation and increases the sustainability value of the treatment agents which reduces treatment cost hcl 0 5 m can oxidize the png molecules adsorbed on the surface of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles therefore the feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles used for each png adsorption photodegradation cycle were regenerated using the following steps i separation from aqueous solution using a magnet ii washing with hcl followed by washing with deionized water iii oven drying and iv reusing for the next treatment cycle under the following experimental conditions ph of 5 png concentration of 10 mg l feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 mg l h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l and total adsorption and photodegradation time of 220 min the experimental results indicated that the feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles can be successfully recycled six times with a negligible decrease in png removal efficiency 3 fig 8 in addition the original quantity of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles only decreased by 0 93 after six adsorption photodegradation cycles and corresponding regeneration tests which can greatly reduce wastewater treatment cost the decrease in quantity of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles may be highlighted in the successive separation processes performed by using a magnet in summary the properties of feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles reported herein suggest that feni3 sio2 zno can be a sustainable wastewater treatment agent with great practical application prospects 4 conclusion in this study feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were prepared and used to remove png from wastewater via adsorption and photodegradation the treatment consisted of 20 min of adsorption followed by 200 min of photodegradation the results revealed that feni3 sio2 zno presented high adsorptive and catalytic abilities for png removal we determined that a removal efficiency of png of 100 at an initial png concentration of 10 mg l could be achieved under the following experimental conditions ph of 5 feni3 sio2 zno concentration of 0 01 g l and h2o2 concentration of 150 mg l the kinetics of the degradation reaction were also studied and it was determined that photodegradation could be mathematically represented using a pseudo first order kinetic model moreover feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles were an economical treatment agent as they were recycled six times with minor losses in png removal efficiency 3 and quantity 1 of the original quantity in summary we concluded that adsorption followed by photodegradation using feni3 sio2 zno nanoparticles as the adsorbent and catalyst and under sunlight irradiation can be an efficient treatment method for the economical safe and environmentally friendly removal of png from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments we would like to thank the research and

13646,acceleration in global industrialisation has led to increasing release of various emerging highly toxic refractory organic pollutants in water bodies these contaminants have been very concerning due to their detrimental impacts on human beings as well as aquatic life even at low concentrations conventional wastewater treatment technology has proven to be ineffective in eliminating these pollutants hence creating substantial attention for a more advanced electro fenton ef technology a systematic bibliometric analysis has been carried out based on scopus database to comprehend the extensive research development of ef technology for the past 2 decades 2000 2019 several aspects were analysed namely general growth trend journal country institutional authorship and keywords analysis vosviewer was utilised to present a clear collaboration between authors countries and co occurrences between research keywords exponentially high publication growth was observed during the recent decade 2010 2019 highlighting the main ef research areas such as electrode and catalyst synthesis application mathematical modelling technology integration and process comparison energy consumption analysis reveals the substantial impact of various ef operational and design parameters on the energy consumed by ef system which then significantly define its economic viability future

bibliometric analysis wastewater treatment electro fenton research trend vosviewer energy consumption 1 introduction the decline of water resources is becoming an increasingly agonising issue for many parts of the world due to rapid growth of world population as well as rapid industrial advancement subsequently more hazardous and recalcitrant pollutants from daily practices are being released into water bodies resulting in the escalation of water resource contamination for example toxic organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products insecticides pesticides fertilisers dyes and phenolic compounds which are the products of development and human actions are found to be frequently entering water supplies 1 2 most of these organic compounds pose detrimental impacts on human being endocrine disruptions as well as abnormalities in certain aquatic lives 3 since the emergence of various persistent pollutants in water bodies could hardly be restrained and their presence has been confirmed in effluents of conventional treatment plants researches on advanced wastewater treatment technology has been very rigorous to keep up with the worldwide demand for cleaner water 4 5 also the recent tightening of regulations by various environmental monitoring bodies has indicated that effluents from many processes will face difficulties to achieve required discharge standards through treatments with primary methods alone thereby strengthening the demand for advanced wastewater treatment processes 6 therefore apart from settling for conventional wastewater treatment system screening sedimentation physical chemical or biological processes superior and more potent processes have been discovered by researchers in water reclamation field in recent decades several advanced water industry technologies with exceptional capability of destroying the emerging pollutants from highly contaminated wastewaters have been introduced examples of these technologies include advanced oxidation or electrochemical advanced oxidation processes aops eaops membrane separation electrochemical processes adsorption process chemical injection and biological processes 7 9 in addition researches on these water reclamation processes have also been broadened to include the designing of integrated wastewater treatment system combining several technologies to promote process intensification eaops have been gaining steadily increasing popularity as reliable wastewater treatment processes as they are found to be more efficient in removing refractory organic pollutants in water bodies compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes these processes are designed using electrochemical principles in which they have received great attention for their ability in solving water pollution problems and establishing environmental compatibility due to the presence of electrons as the main clean reagent 10 examples of electrochemical processes that have been developed and applied on different wastewaters are electrochemical oxidation electrocoagulation electro fenton ef electrodialysis microbial fuel cell photo electrochemical cell and many others 11 12 focusing on eaops ef is deemed to be the most popular technique due to its simplicity and outstanding performance in degradation of persistent organic pollutants pops as well as water disinfection degradation of toxic organic pollutants is crucial as they are considered detrimental in general even when their presence is at the lowest concentration hence highlighting the immediate vitality of this ef technology 13 through rigorous technical environmental and economical sustainability enhancement this ef process is able to be implemented in wide variety of industries as a highly effective and green water reclamation system 1 1 electro fenton ef process ef process was originally derived from an advanced oxidation process aop using fenton reagent resulting in the reaction between hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous salt fe2 to oxidise organics compounds 7 14 the conventional fenton process was then modified with electrochemical technology resulting in the ef process that has the ability to generate in situ hydrogen peroxide h2o2 at cathode in the presence of oxygen feeding and iron catalyst homogenous or heterogeneous externally added to the effluent the main reactions that take place in this process are as follows 15 1 h2o2 generation o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 hydroxyl radical formation f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o o h based on eq 2 hydroxyl h o radical acts as strong oxidising agent to oxidise organic compounds until they reach total mineralisation i e converted to carbon dioxide water and inorganic ions this hydroxyl radical is recognised as the second strongest oxidising agent after fluorine with a standard reduction potential of e h o h2o 2 8 v she thus explaining its outstanding performance in destroying most organic and organo metallic pollutants 10 besides that advanced ef processes have also been developed to further expand the performance of this ideology in water reclamation field these include photoelectron fenton pef peroxi coagulation pc sonoelectro fenton sef solar photo electro fenton spef bioelectro fenton bef and fered fenton ff 7 10 16 17 these technologies have been innovatively designed by researchers and investigated on different types of recalcitrant wastewaters or synthetic persistent organic pollutants effluents such as pharmaceutical pesticides dyes landfill leachate agriculture abattoir food and textile the efficiency of these ef based processes as compelling wastewater treatment method has attracted huge attention from academic researchers as well as industrial players to continuously invest in perfecting these technologies moreover ef process is more superior to other conventional wastewater treatment processes due to advantages such as considerably simple process design low installation cost highly efficient cod and pollutant abatement promote higher biodegradability of treated wastewater and unnecessary storage of dangerous h2o2 6 7 17 19 however there are several challenges that need to be overcome to improve the attractiveness of this process for larger industrial application for example the requirement of suitable electrolyte for different types of wastewater effluent very low operating ph high energy consumption electrical and also the possible evolution of hazardous side products in treated water 6 11 despite the challenges ef process is generally known to be environmentally friendly with no production of secondary pollutants however in cases where overall pollutant mineralisation is not achieved toxic organic or inorganic products could be generated 20 so suggested key aspects towards promoting highly efficient ef process for water reclamation lie on the energy consumption feasibility operating ph cathode and catalyst stability in continuous process h2o2 generation abatement capability of extensive range of organic pollutants minimised toxic by products formation and combination of this process with other technologies hence it is rather difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of a particular ef process without analysing the combination of these key aspects extensive researches have been conducted by researchers from different parts of the world on this ef technology for remediation of contaminated water this is proven by the emerging number of review papers published on this technology various aspects have been discussed in these published papers such as parameters influence advancement of fenton chemistry to ef processes introduction of heterogeneous catalysts in ef processes and application of these processes to wide variety of wastewaters or pollutants table 1 shows the list of top 17 highly cited review papers obtained from scopus focusing on ef processes from the past years although there are other highly cited review papers with slight discussion on ef those papers are not included here as the focus of the papers is mainly on performance comparison between several electrochemical chemical processes instead of emphasising ef or fenton chemistry development it is also worth mentioning that ef focused review papers are not the only papers included in the fore mentioned table some publications focusing on aops or specific pollutants with considerably significant discussion on ef technology are also included so referring to the listed review papers in table 1 they are deemed to extensively discuss ef processes as well as the classical fenton processes to highlight the advance of this fenton chemistry in producing safe treated water the most cited review paper by pignatello et al 2006 had extensively discussed the theory of fenton mechanisms as well as highlighting the shift of fenton process from fenton reagents injection system to in situ fenton reagents generation system using ef processes this paper is important to instil sufficient understanding for future researchers on the crucial principles of this fenton technology it can also be observed that most of the highly cited papers had reviewed the influence of design and operational parameters on ef processes which mostly take into account some factors such as reactor design electrode material catalyst concentration working ph and current density also almost all review papers discuss and summarise the application of these ef processes on different types of real wastewaters and emerging organic pollutants to investigate the development of this eoap throughout the years besides that increasing number of researchers have been focusing on the study of various heterogeneous catalysts materials in ef technology due to its capability in resolving several classical ef process drawbacks these catalysts are described as solid iron catalyst from various sources instead of classical soluble fe2 salts to promote catalytic generation of ho radicals in uncontrolled ph conditions 21 22 some of the desirable features of this heterogeneous electro fenton hef process are extended operational ph range recyclability of catalyst and reduction of iron hydroxide sludge formation 23 24 these observations highlight the great focus shown by numerous researchers on the application and efficiency improvement of these ef processes in wastewater treatment study generally the number of ef review papers being published during recent years of 2018 and 2019 is noticeably higher compared to the previous years totalling 16 papers during these 2 years table s1 supplementary information represents the list of ef related review papers published in the aforementioned 2 years in which these papers have been cited at least once the review aspect of these papers is still concentrating on the influence of operational parameters in ef processes but it can be observed that more focus is now given to the study of heterogeneous catalysts or nano catalysts electrode modification reactor configurations and pollution degradation mechanisms possibility of toxic side products formation of different types of ef processes moreover instead of focusing only on classical fenton and ef process there is also growing interest among researchers on perfecting the more advanced ef based processes such as pef spef bef and hef therefore as additional value to the published technical review papers it is essential to have a strategic summary on the existing researches of this ef technology to capture the research trends of this technology in relation to water reclamation field 25 bibliometric analysis bibliometric study is a powerful statistical tool with the capability to map publications around the world on a specific research field the bibliometric analysis will help to assist in identifying the established or emerging research areas of a particular discipline thus evaluating and quantifying the growth of the literatures published 38 39 besides that this bibliometric method is also useful in recognising cooperation patterns between performance and research patterns of journals authors countries and institutions 40 41 this tool has gained increasing popularity in the recent years as it is found to be useful in the trend study of many disciplines such as social science 40 42 environmental science 39 41 medicine 43 44 engineering 45 46 art and humanities 47 economics 38 and energy 48 in view of this study the most recent advances as well as the current gaps of a particular research field could be emphasised vividly therefore the past current and forthcoming research outlook could be outlined as a guide for researchers in a particular field in relation to ef technology to the best of our knowledge there is a gap in statistical research trend information using bibliometric analysis even though there are reasonably high number of review papers being published on this topic as mentioned in section 1 1 considering the budding research interest in ef based processes as pollutant degradation incentive it is crucial to produce a quantitative bibliometric study on this topic in order to ease the selection of future study areas it is emphasised that this study is aimed for the evaluation of ef technology derived from the published academic literature database using bibliometric analysis technique a thorough summary of researches on this technology is carried out by analysing the related published literatures in scopus database from year 2000 2019 for the years prior to 2000 the number of publications is not significant with a total of only 9 publications during the four year period of 1996 1999 hence recent publications of year 2000 2019 are highlighted as they represented more updated research work the keywords searched in scopus are narrowed to electro fenton and peroxi coagulation the electro fenton keyword resulted in the formation of a database comprising all desired published literatures related to ef technology such as classical ef pef spef bef sef and many other advanced ef based processes subsequently the keyword peroxi coagulation was added on top of electro fenton due to some authors using this term in their publications without specifying the keyword ef even though this peroxi coagulation process is part of ef technology through refined procedure of extracting relevant ef articles 1258 articles are found to be highly appropriate for further analysis detailed procedure of extracting articles from scopus is presented by figure s1 supplementary information abstracts are screened to categorise the journal articles on different nature of study and publication subject area statistical data analysis is carried out with respect to year country journal and institution aspects while bibliometric network analysis is executed for a number of aspects such as keywords occurrences co authorship and country collaboration for this analysis interpretation and visualisation are carried out using vosviewer software these aspects are deemed to be able to provide clear insights of current ef research progress as well as predict emerging research prospects 1 2 economic analysis universally cost is one of the many important aspects in our current society focusing on the application of this ef technology in industrial level it is crucial to have a comprehensive comparison on the performance and the cost of these ef processes as these help to decide on the best ef application strategy in order to increase the competitiveness of eaops against conventional wastewater treatment systems for implementation in larger industrial scale limitations in terms of process performance design and cost operational and design have to be overcome focus is put on processes related to ef technology which is not limited to the classic ef process but also involves many other innovative ef processes such as sef pef hef spef pc and bef generally with reference to the aforementioned processes operating cost is comprised of several crucial aspects such as energy consumption chemicals and electrodes utilisation along with other ancillary aspects such as maintenance labour sludge dewatering and disposal and other fixed costs 49 despite the various cost contribution elements the focus of this economic evaluation section will be on the operational element that has the largest contribution to the total operational cost of a particular ef process which is the energy consumption economic analysis of ef processes was carried out on several articles published within the last three years 2018 2020 the articles extracted for this economic analysis are ensured to have reasonable evaluation on the energy consumption aspect of an ef process at least one article is included for each type of ef based processes energy consumption could be represented in terms of energy consumed per toc removal cod removal or volume of treated effluent the general electrical energy consumption eec formulas are shown as follows 50 3 e e c k w h k g c o d o r t o c 1000 u i t c v 4 e e c k w h m 3 1000 u i t v u voltage v i current a t electrolysis time h v volume of wastewater l c cod or toc removed mg l all in all the study on ef s economic evaluation is essential due to the fact that the development of an efficient yet simple and cost effective process is still a major challenge for researchers and industries 51 even with the presence of considerably strong argument from technical and environment standpoint for a particular ef process a compelling argument from economical viewpoint is still compulsory without convincing arguments from these three aspects technical environmental and economic the adoption of ef technology in industries will continue to be slow moving 2 bibliometric analysis 2 1 general growth trend the general growth trend of the ef published articles per year are graphically represented into two separate graphs to distinguish the publication growth between the first decade 2000 2009 and the second decade 2010 2019 fig 1 shows the publication growth trend for the first decade 2000 2009 it could be seen that during the first decade the number of ef articles being published have stable increment especially from 2006 to 2009 from 2000 2004 the number of ef publications per year is quite low with no apparent trend this could represent the start up phase as its publication trend is rather unstable through the abstracts analysis it was deemed that the ef studies during this phase were only focusing on application of ef process on several types of pollutants or wastewaters as well as the study of degradation pathway with respect to the treated pollutants the study on degradation pathway is important in order to identify the intermediates formed during degradation process especially on their toxicity and how they are broken down to final products which are water carbon dioxide and inorganic minerals also there is noticeable focus of study on process comparison during this phase for example there are articles comparing different types of ef processes as well as comparison with classical fenton based processes or anodic oxidation process then from 2005 to 2009 there is a steady increase in number of ef publications with huge increment observed in 2007 during these years the research on ef technology has started to gain more attention from some researchers the popular areas of study are similar to previous years but with higher interest on the study of the impact of parameters on the performance of ef processes in treating various pops and wastewaters examples of the operational parameters being studied are applied current iron catalyst dosing initial ph electrolysis time oxygen sparging rate and type of iron catalyst 52 55 now referring to fig 2 representing ef publication growth in the second decade 2010 2019 a significant increase in the number of ef publications per year is observed a slightly slow increment is seen from year 2010 2012 then year 2013 onwards shows a better increasing trend indicating the start of booming phase from year 2015 onwards the number of published articles exceeded 100 publications per year implying that this ef technology is beginning to receive higher recognition among researchers in this water reclamation technology field during this phase the nature of study for this ef technology has become more diverse with more attention given on other areas of research besides the previously mentioned study areas additional nature of study areas were enhanced such as electrode and heterogeneous catalyst synthesisation integrated wastewater treatment processes mathematical modelling for process optimisation purpose electrode comparison and also innovative process or reactor design for the papers published before 2010 these areas of study have been attempted by some researchers but huge focus was not gained during those years in 2015 the study of electrode and catalyst synthesisation began to receive significant attention from many researchers hef process is gaining increasing attention due to its efficacy in degrading organic pollutants at wide ph range and limited metal leaching during catalyst recycle 56 also cathode synthesis has been a significantly important approach of increasing performance of ef process in terms of h2o2 generation in particular thus this explains the emerging number of publications reporting on electrode synthesis for instance graphene coated electrode 57 58 transition metal embedded electrode 59 60 and nitrogen doped electrode 61 62 for year 2018 2019 there is a considerably big jump in the number of published ef articles compared to 2017 which is from 130 to 182 and 215 respectively during these 2 years besides the study on synthesisation of electrodes and catalysts these articles are also reporting on other areas of study such as process optimisation mathematic modelling processes comparison processes integration reactor and process design the steady increase in these areas of study has revealed the growing researchers attention in discovering this ef process at greater depth in general it is rather obvious from fig 1 that during the first decade 2000 2009 the cumulative number of ef publications is 175 while in the second decade 2010 2019 shown in fig 2 a total of 1084 published papers is recorded which is about 6 times higher than previous decade this observation could be linked to the core purpose of this ef technology which is to degrade persistent and emerging organic pollutants especially since these persistent pollutants are able to be detected using advanced technology this explains the increasing consciousness to remove these emerging refractory pollutants examples of conventional and emerging technology for persistent organic pollutants detection are high performance liquid chromatography hplc gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa and fluorescence spectroscopy 63 overall the witnessed growth evolution of ef articles is undeniably spectacular hence highlighting the breakthrough of research in ef technology through diversification of ef study areas in 2020 the number of ef publications is expected to exceed 200 assuming the rising trend in fig 2 is maintained 2 2 journal analysis a total of 1258 ef related journal articles were published in 236 journals between the years 2000 2019 referring to fig 3 of the 236 journals analysed 89 is accounted for by journals with 10 and less publications over a period of two decades these journals are categorised in group a remaining 4 and 7 represented journals with more than 30 publications each group b and journals with number of publications between 11 30 each group c respectively now when scrutinising the number of ef articles published by journals in each group group b contributed the most ef articles which is 43 from a total of 1258 articles even though this group represents the least number of journals which is 10 as for group a and c each contributed 36 and 19 of the total published articles respectively eventually for clarity purpose of this analysis only journals of group b are selected for further analysis in this section as they are deemed to be of top 10 most productive journals in ef publications although there is a significantly huge number of journals in group a 89 their low average ef publication per journal does not represent their productivity fig 4 represents the top 10 most productive journals in ef publications throughout the two decades 2000 2019 along with their respective if from this plot it is clear that the top three most productive journals are electrochimica acta if 5 383 85 publications chemosphere if 5 108 76 publications and hazardous materials if 7 65 73 publications the figure also differentiates the number of literatures published by each journal during the first decade 2000 2009 and second decade 2010 2019 during the first decade the number of publications per journal is approximately 20 or less which is rather low in this decade the three journals with most publications are journal of hazardous material if 7 65 20 publications water research if 7 913 14 publications and chemosphere ef 5 108 13 publications however for publications in second decade each journal managed to contribute more than 65 publications of the total publication in the second decade this indicates that the publications in second decade have proven to be more significant towards contributing to the productivity of each journal during this second decade the top 3 journals are found to be slightly different from the overall and first decade top journals which are electrochimica acta if 5 383 74 publications chemosphere ef 5 108 63 publications and chemical engineering journal if 8 355 56 publications furthermore out of 19 subject categories enlisted for these ef publications environmental science topped with 58 16 followed by chemistry 48 72 and chemical engineering 42 45 these main subject categories further support the publication scopes of the aforementioned top three journals in which electrochimica acta focused on works in the field of electrochemistry chemosphere on environmental science as well as engineering and chemical engineering journal which focused on environmental chemical engineering along with materials synthesisation next for thorough journal analysis focus was on the top 3 most productive journals during the second decade the growth in publication number for these journals is related to the progress trend of different nature of study of this ef technology which is further discussed in this section generally the nature of ef study could be categorised into several aspects for example electrode catalyst synthesis technology integration electrochemical process comparison mathematical modelling and ef application to wastewater focusing on type of pollutant electrode diversity parameter study process design and degradation pathway table s2 supplementary information demonstrates the anticipated nature of study in ef published articles along with its brief description getting into the main focus of this journal analysis fig 5 depicts the growth in ef publications for the fore mentioned three most productive journals from the year 2010 2019 sudden peak on publication number is observed in 2018 and slightly dropped in 2019 even with the fall in number of publications for these 3 journals the number of overall ef publications could be seen increasing in 2019 as per fig 2 this could be explained by the emerging interest of other journals in publishing ef literatures which support the huge overall ef publications in 2019 throughout 2018 the spike in chemosphere journal publication is very obvious as number of publications showed a four fold increase within a year as seen in fig 6 this increment is thought to be contributed by the research on synthesisation of electrode and catalyst as well as the study on comparison between advanced electro oxidation processes this synthesis study refers to the discovery of novel materials for cathode modification and also the fabrication of various heterogeneous catalysts to enhance the performance of ef processes overall throughout the whole decade starting in 2010 chemosphere journal publications are deemed to be focused on the fundamental aspect of ef technology which are the study of process comparison and pollutant s degradation mechanism observed from the ongoing publication of these studies throughout most of the years next the most productive journal with highest ef publication is the electrochimica acta journal in which the number of published ef articles peak in 2015 and 2016 which is 2 3 years earlier compared to chemosphere journal from this observation electrochimica acta journal is believed to be responsible for promoting the popularity of ef study in terms of synthesisation and process comparison which then triggers chemosphere journal to escalate its ef article publications related to this nature of study scanning through from the peak year 2015 2019 the dominant nature of study that managed to gain high publication in this electrochimica acta journal are the synthesis electrochemical process comparison and the process design this trend entails that most of the articles accepted by this journal are focusing on both fundamental and pioneering studies to further enhance the potential of ef process lastly from fig 5 the third top journal which is chemical engineering journal recorded one sharp peak in ef publication which occurred in 2013 based on fig 6 the majority of papers published during the peak year are of synthesis and process comparison nature of study in which this observation is similar to the two previously discussed journals chemosphere and electrochimica acta so comparing all three top journals it seems that chemical engineering journal is the first journal which increased its number of publications on synthesisation study in 2013 followed by electrochimica acta in 2014 and finally chemosphere in 2018 this development of catalyst and electrode synthesisation as well as process comparison has encouraged researchers to venture into more areas of study which then led to apparent growth in ef publication of different nature of study in this chemical engineering journal as per fig 5 a stable increase in publication from these journals since 2015 indicates the increase in the number of published articles of other nature of study such as sequential treatment integration electrode comparison parameters influence and also process or reactor design scrutinising on the nature of articles published by all three journals during the most recent years which are 2018 and 2019 it appears that the interest of ef study is inclining towards synthesisation and electrode study for electrochimica acta journal as shown from some of the publications 64 66 as for chemosphere journal the focus of study is inclined towards process comparison and electrode catalyst synthesisation or modification 67 69 while for chemical engineering journal sequential treatment integration and synthesisation are the focused area of study during these recent two years 70 72 referring to the observed publication trend and published articles nature of study from these three major journals it can be concluded that the current interest of this ef study is inclined towards the exploration of environmentally friendly materials for synthesisation of highly efficient electrode and heterogeneous catalysts these new advanced materials are anticipated to be continuously developed for enhanced electrochemical h2o2 production and more testing required to evaluate long term stability of cathode materials 73 in addition to increasing discovery of nanomaterials application in aops the development of economic and eco friendly process for nanomaterials formation that is suitable for environmental applications is also becoming one of the focuses of this ef study 74 all of these studies are viewed as an effort to encourage innovation among researchers which will result in the establishment of highly competent and more advanced ef processes it is also noticed that the total number of publications for these three journals dropped from 49 in 2018 to 33 in 2019 deduction drawn from this observation is that the lab scale research of ef technology has started to reach saturation point hence implying the need for pilot scale study and real life implementation this interpretation is supported by oonnittan and sillanpä 2012 and nidheesh zhou and oturan 2018 in which these researchers agreed that scaling up these eaops remains a major challenge that must be overcome to accomplish the real implementation of this technology 20 31 for the reason of justifying the highly attended nature of study for ef publications top 10 ef publications during the first and second decade is examined table s3 supplementary information and table s4 supplementary information reveal the fore mentioned publications from the enlisted articles it is perceived that most of these highly cited papers are published by the top 10 productive journals presented in fig 4 in which these journals have reasonably high if focusing on the nature of study of the highly cited articles for both decades the study on process comparison seems to gain highest interest among researchers the possible explanation for this observation is the inquisitiveness of researchers in exploring the competitiveness of several emerging eaops through the analysis on many aspects such as pollutant degradation efficiency kinetic rate constant and electrical energy consumption 75 76 also it is noticed that the enlisted top cited published ef papers cover almost all study areas suggested in this analysis as per table s2 supplementary information except two study areas which are synthesis and integration this is because these two study areas only started to gain popularity during middle of the second decade hence these articles have not been able to reach the list of highly cited publications as a certain period of time is required to build up the citation count 2 3 country and institution analysis in general through the data obtained from scopus 58 different countries have contributed to ef publication among those countries 14 have more than 20 ef publications each which are recognised as top productive countries and include five asian countries four american countries three european countries and two african countries this enlisted top 14 countries is presented in table s5 supplementary information it is to be noted that some publications can be related to more than one country due to collaborations between researchers and institutions from different parts of the world from this table it could be seen that the top 4 countries with remarkably high publications above 100 are china 443 followed by spain 212 france 165 and iran 103 also it is obvious that there is quite a large jump in publication number between china and second most productive country spain which is about a 2 fold difference referring to fig 7 it is noticed that spain and france are the first two countries to publish ef articles during the first two years 2000 and 2001 with somewhat similar publication trend throughout most years in 2002 china researchers started publishing ef articles which its publication trend appearing to increase rapidly as of 2005 thus overtaking the two aforementioned countries also from 2017 2019 it is obvious that the number of publications by china spiked up intensely making it the dominant country in this ef research highest publication by china is recorded in 2019 95 publications in which this publication record is about 4 6 times larger compared to the number of ef publications in the same year by three other countries spain france iran this high productivity by china could be ascribed to the huge support and high amount of research funding from china government on wastewater treatment technology development also with respect to high environmental awareness and more stringent regulation standards in china various industries as well as researchers have been challenging themselves to seek for appropriate wastewater treatment technologies 77 since china is one of the developing countries facing high water shortages this water technology study could lead a way out for china from its position as one of the thirteen countries in the world with poorest per capita water resources 78 next observing the publication trend by iran it shows that publication of ef articles only started in 2008 the lagging of ef publication in iran shows that this technology only started to gain the attention of iranian researchers after a prominent number of ef articles establishing this technology s exquisiteness has been enthusiastically published overall the total number of ef publications for each year from these 4 most productive countries accounted for approximately 55 100 of the total yearly ef publications figure s2 supplementary information illustrates the collaboration network between the top 14 most productive countries in ef research as can be seen in the diagram the top 4 productive countries china spain france and iran are displayed in larger circles compared to the rest of the listed countries this denotes the large number of ef articles published by these leading countries compared to others additionally table 2 summarises the collaboration strength between the top 14 countries as well as the citation scores of the countries publications for each country the number of links portrays the number of countries a particular country had collaborated with the top three countries with highest collaboration network 9 links are spain france and united states while the countries with lowest collaboration link number 3 links is recorded for taiwan and iran both spain and france demonstrate high total link strength which are 105 and 123 respectively indicating that these two countries have the most extensive and strong research collaboration with other countries also citation number and normalised citation score are used to analyse the quality of ef research work and publications by each of the countries it can be observed that although china has the most ef publications its number of citations is lower than that of spain and france the high citation number obtained by spain and france could be attributed to the high presence of ef literatures published by these countries at early stage of ef research year 2000 2004 these early stage publications help the countries to gain a great number of citations due to the likelihood of the published articles to be treated as guidance source by other researchers since china only started to produce much higher ef publication recently year 2017 2019 the citation number is still increasing and has not received much attention from researchers this explains the lower citation number obtained by china compared to spain and france moreover the normalised citation number gained by china shows the highest score 425 63 which is far ahead compared to spain and france this observation denotes the ef publications from china do receive reasonably significant referencing by other researchers as for other countries listed in table 2 the normalised citation scores are much lower than the top 3 productive countries but still adequately good in which the scores are in the range of 24 72 based on scopus database 160 institutions have recorded the publication of ef articles the top 15 most productive institutions in terms of publication number are listed in table 3 each of these institutions has produced more than 20 publications in two decades time 2000 2019 of these eight are chinese two are spanish and french and one each are taiwanese iranian and turkish the top 3 institutions with more than 100 publications are led by universitat de barcelona spain 149 publications followed by université paris est france 115 publications and ministry of education china china 105 publications each of these top 3 most productive institutions represented the top 3 productive countries in the contribution to ef publications in some countries the establishment of water related research centre had encouraged the formation of a hub in which researchers will pool their resources to conduct various aspects of study on the ef technology hence this tactic will help to elevate the institution s research productivity and reputation as well as its publication number this explains the certain occurrence in which a particular institution of a particular country is able to be listed as one of the top most productive institutions but overall the country s total publication number is not very significant besides that it is noticed that certain countries with reasonably high publication number above 60 publications such as brazil india and mexico do not have any of their institutions shortlisted as one of the top 15 productive institutions this is probably because in such countries research is not led by a single research centre in which majority of the ef publications originates from a particular centre instead many institutions across the country are publishing the ef articles hence it is not possible to highlight the number of ef publications from each of the institutions to summarise it could be extracted from the results in table 2 and table 3 that there is important correlation along with rational justification between the most significant institutions and the most productive countries 2 4 authorship analysis this authorship analysis bestows recognition to individuals that are deemed to have made significant research contribution to ef technology throughout two decades time 2000 2019 therefore 10 most productive authors in terms of number of published ef articles have been listed in table 4 it is seen that the authors listed are from the mentioned top 3 most productive countries which are china spain and france out of the 10 listed authors spain dominated with the highest number of prolific authors 7 authors followed by france 2 authors and china 1 author a fascinating observation is made on these authors as most of them are affiliated to the similar university of each country the huge research focus towards ef study displayed by the spanish researchers from universitat de barcelona resulted in the university being the most productive institution in this ef investigation as per table 3 in section 2 3 as for the french authors both of them are associated with the same institution in the country université paris est while the sole productive chinese author in this list represented nankai university china in general the countries and institutions associated with these top 10 most prolific authors agreed with the productive countries and institutions recorded in the previous section fig 8 portrays the co authorship network between top 27 productive researchers in ef technology study this collaboration network does not represent the overall collaboration for all authors as this analysis was limited to a number of highly productive authors with more than 15 ef publications the three biggest clusters observed along with their respective leading authors are as follows red cluster leading author brillas e green cluster leading author oturan m a and blue cluster leading author rodriguez r m these authors portray high number of co authorship connection more than 10 links per author and reasonably strong collaboration link strength with their co authors which highlights their extensive research collaboration activity the information on authors collaboration strength and citation score is presented in table 4 the term link refers to the number of co authors a particular author is connected to while the term total link strength refers to the overall extensiveness of the author s collaboration activity which is displayed through the thickness of the link curves it is worthwhile mentioning that since this collaboration network is limited to top 27 authors the number of collaborations number of links and collaboration strength total link strength did not represent the real co authors relationship between each researcher in this ef study from both table 4 and collaboration network brillas e is the most influential author with highest number of collaborations among the highly productive authors 17 collaborations as well as having huge leap in collaboration strength 325 compared to the other authors this is a very expected observation since brilllas e is known to be the developer of this ef technology in which this statement is supported with the largest citation number and normalised citation score 219 62 obtained by him since brillas e is affiliated with universitat de barcelona this explains the significant number of ef researchers coming from the same university besides that two french authors oturan m a and oturan n who are linked to the same french institution have managed to also dominate this research area as both attain rather significant collaboration strength 172 and 170 and competitively high normalised citation score 214 83 and 185 25 respectively as for the chinese author zhou m who is among the top 10 productive authors in this ef research this is a rather noteworthy achievement as china only started to show interest in this ef technology two years after spain and france 2 5 keywords analysis author keywords are phrases that define the field or research issue of a publication relevant keywords are required to be outlined by authors to ensure a particular publication is able to attract researchers from the same research field hence increasing its citation score with respect to the ef study bibliometric data analysed resulted in a total of 2209 author keywords the occurrence of the keywords is set to above 5 minimum occurrence of 6 resulting in 129 items generated into keywords co occurrence network visualisation as per fig 9 each keyword is represented by a circle and the size of the circle highlighted the occurrences of the keywords the larger the circle the more frequent a particular keyword being used in ef publications the connection links between keywords show the co occurrences of the connected keywords the strength of a link between specific keywords can be assessed from the thickness of its link curve as expected the term electro fenton dominated the author keywords having largest occurrence in publications represented by largest circle and widest linkage with other keywords represented by number of links and link strength besides that as noticed the author keywords have been classified into three clusters cluster 1 red cluster 2 green and cluster 3 blue keywords of the same colour cluster suggested reasonably similar topic discussed by the respective publications referring to the three main clusters appropriate ef subfield categorisation could be allocated based on the dominating keywords in the respective clusters in cluster 1 red keywords such as electrocoagulation peroxi coagulation electrooxidation cod electro fenton ef dye removal catalysis treatment landfill leachate and coking wastewater are seemingly related to the study of efficacy comparison between several electrochemical processes in treating various wastewaters and pollutants as for keywords in cluster 2 green they represent the study of advanced ef processes and the toxicity of oxidation side products produced by primarily pharmaceutical products this area of study is indicated by the use of keywords such as anodic oxidation solar photoelectro fenton oxidation products boron doped diamond electrochemical advanced oxidation solar light photoelectrocatalysis photoelectron fenton process ciprofloxacin and tetracycline next the keywords in cluster 3 blue symbolise the study of cathode synthesisation and modification to promote highly competent ef process example of the implied keywords are graphite felt modification activated carbon fiber graphene electrochemical oxidation carbon felt three dimensional electrode carbon nanotube oxygen reduction reaction current efficiency and energy consumption besides the term electro fenton there are several other terms that received reasonably high occurrences in ef publications which are photoelectron fenton 75 occurrences water treatment 76 occurrences anodic oxidation 73 occurrences degradation 73 occurrences mineralization 112 occurrences and hydroxyl radical 81 occurrences hydroxyl radical and anodic oxidation are part of key pollutant removal mechanisms in the ef process hence these keywords are largely used by the authors it can be said that these keywords are among the fundamental terms in ef publications with application to water treatment field also the keyword photoelectron fenton gained quite high popularity as an advanced ef process due to its high efficacy in mineralising more persistent organic pollutants such as pharmaceutical drugs and dyes it is defended by numerous researchers that in many occasions pef have demonstrated greater pollutant removal potential compared to classical ef process 7 31 besides that referring to the keyword hydrogen peroxide 76 occurrences in blue cluster this crucial fenton reagent is designed to be generated from cathode of an ef system it may well be argued that the success of this ef technology rests heavily on the properties and characteristic of cathode some of the cathode properties heavily focused by researchers are three dimensional structure oxygen reduction current efficiency energy consumption and hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration these keywords are visualised in fig 9 in addition ef technology has been widely tested on many types of synthetic or real wastewaters and pollutants while some types of pollutants have not been thoroughly treated with this technology quite a number have been the focus of researchers such as landfill leachate pharmaceutical dye pesticides and coking wastewater as per fig 9 furthermore looking into keywords analysis in terms of publication years figure s3 and figure s4 portray the visualisations of author keywords based on average publications per year score during the first decade 2000 2009 of keywords analysis most of the keywords only stood out starting in 2008 2009 this is supported by the publication growth trend in fig 1 from section 2 1 showing that the ef publication number only started to be significant during the year 2008 2009 hence majority of the keywords gain their recognition from the publications that have been made throughout these two years subsequently for second decade 2010 2019 keywords analysis the keywords occurrences could be categorised into 3 periods which are early decade 2010 2013 mid decade 2014 2016 and end decade 2017 2019 during the early decade numerous publications presented keywords such as oxidation products degradation pathway cod chemical oxygen demand kinetic model and experimental design from these keywords it is implied that during this period the ef scope of study is focusing more on the fundamentals parameter study of ef technology and its capability in treating various pollutants with minimal production of environmentally toxic side products during mid decade the focus of ef study is seen to be slightly shifted towards process integration and comparison of different wastewater treatment technology this observation is rather similar to the nature of study trend for ef publications shown in chemosphere and electrochimica acta journals in fig 6 the gain in popularity of several advanced ef processes such as pc pef spef and bef can also be perceived during this period all these statements are supported by the keywords visualised in figure s4 which are photoelectrocatalysis solar photoelectron fenton peroxi coagulation electrochemical oxidation and microbial fuel cell finally during the end decade the keywords that stand out more are oxygen reduction reaction graphite felt activated carbon graphene and heterogeneous catalyst these terms confirmed that during this period the area of study of this ef subject is more focused towards synthesising heterogeneous catalysts as well as cathode modification this analysis on nature of ef study from year 2017 2019 highly supports the finding obtained in section 2 2 3 energy consumption analysis ordinarily operational cost of ef technology is highly influenced by the energy consumption chemical utilisation and electrode consumption of a particular system table 5 listed several selected articles having cost estimation analysis carried out on the respective ef systems subject to the design of a particular ef process to achieve a specific pollutant removal efficiency range its total operational cost could be incredibly high or reasonably favourable it is observed from the table that the two main costing features with biggest contribution to the total operational cost of an ef system are energy consumption and chemical especially fenton reagents costs it is deduced that in an electrochemical technology electrical energy consumption is more crucial than chemical cost as it is part of the compulsory design of this technology meanwhile the cost of externally injected fenton reagents could be regarded as an option depending on the design of a particular ef system having significant impact on the ef system s economic viability this energy consumption attribute could be controlled through the regulation of other aspects of the technology such as chemical usage planning as well as electrode choice in order to promote this technology into a cost effective pollutant mineralisation tool in short energy cost could vary widely as it highly depends on the type of wastewater effluent being treated operational parameters and design of the electrochemical reactor generally it is noticed that the major operational cost of this ef technology is predominant due to the amount of energy required for its operation 51 one of the possible justifications is the electrogeneration of h2o2 instead of being supplied externally hence justifying the need of high electrical energy usage this energy consumption aspect is also an important evaluation for pollutant mineralisation process as it could vary along the efficiency of a particular ef process in mineralising a specific pollutant chemical utilisation in ef processes comprises the following activities ph alteration through acid or base dosing salt solution addition for conductivity control hydrogen peroxide addition fe ii catalyst injection heterogeneous catalysts dosing and air oxygen sparging among these chemicals the two main focus are the fe ii catalyst and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in which these two are defined as fenton reagents in comparison to fenton based chemical process this ef process provides better alternative in terms of costs and risks associated with the production mobilisation and storage of the fenton reagents 84 in ef technology hydrogen peroxide h2o2 could be electrogenerated on site at cathode through the 2 electron reduction reaction of oxygen while fe ii catalyst can be supplied from iron anode or regenerate from cathodic reduction of fe iii at cathode however depending on the design of an ef system some systems do still maintain externally supplied fe ii fe iii and h2o2 to ef reactor either continuously or as initial boost step only in relation to h2o2 being generated on site at cathode for oxidation of pollutants this ideology has been increasingly attracting lots of attention from researchers as well as industrial players as stated by martínez huitle et al 2015 the increasing focus towards this on site h2o2 generation could be explained by the attractive opportunity of reducing h2o2 supply cost associated with h2o2 production storage transportation and handling 85 this viewpoint is supporting the claim in section 2 2 of bibliometric analysis in which the study of cathode and catalyst synthesisation for advanced h2o2 generation is observed to grown in popularity during the recent two years 2018 and 2019 electrode consumption is referring to the life expectancy and reusability of a particular electrode with respect to electrode dissolution chemical poisoning and corrosion attack on electrode s surface also the choice of electrode s materials both anode and cathode contributes to the costing of an ef process the dilemma on the choice of electrode in terms of cost stability and size is quite complex for example as anode the electrode of precious metals and bdd boron doped diamond are expensive and the application of these electrodes in full scale application of wastewater remediation may not be very realistic 7 however the usage of inexpensive anodes may not be the best choice as some of these electrodes are electrochemically less stable as for cathode responsible for this ef process the crucial aspects that needed to be taken into account are the robustness of the electrode to withstand vigorous wastewater as well as the capability of the electrode to efficiently generate h2o2 so it is worth mentioning that cathode imparts high impact to ef processes as it affects h2o2 generation and the reusability performance of the cathode highly influence the costing of these processes 86 also size of electrode has to be optimised while the usage of small sized highly precious electrode may save on the cost of electrode it may also increase the energy cost of an ef process due to long electrolysis treatment duration hence proper economic evaluation is required in order to compromise between affordable cost of electrode reasonable electrode size and high electrode stability lifetime after all the activity of both anode and cathode cannot be overlooked as anode produces hydroxyl radical oh or iron ions fe2 while cathode generates h2o2 for ef processes to take place table 6 represents the example of ef articles in which the authors include a small part of economic evaluation in their publications as expected most authors tend to focus on energy consumption cost as it usually covers the largest percentage of total operational cost of an ef system there are a number of ways in which energy consumption could be measured for example energy consumption per volume of wastewater treated kwh m3 energy consumption per cod removed kwh kg cod and energy consumption per toc removed kwh kg toc evidently there is a huge variety of ef based processes that are utilised for the degradation of multiple organic pollutants resulting in high mineralisation efficiencies hence seven different ef processes are included in this economic evaluation in which these articles are taken from recent three publication years which are 2018 2020 the ef processes are classical ef hef pef spef pc bef and sef in general comparison of energy consumption between ef processes is rather complex due to the variance in many aspects such as type of process type of wastewater or pollutants treated current applied chemicals utilised type of electrode reactor configuration treatment time and many others ef process diversity the first main aspect affecting energy consumption cost is the different type of ef process for example pef process is usually being compared with classical ef process to investigate its worthiness to be implemented in industrial scale referring to study by queiroz et al 2019 in total pef system consume 0 279 kw h g toc which is about half of the energy consumed by ef system 0 468 kw h g toc even though pef system results in much higher toc removal efficiency compared to ef system 87 this could be explained from the competent photolysis of fe iii hydroxy species in pef system which generated large number of oh radicals responsible for pollutant mineralisation hence lowering the system s energy consumption per toc removed however the highly effective pef system does pose a slight weakness towards industrial scale implementation this is due to the high total energy consumption by pef system when the energy from light source is taken into account which is 8 81 kw h g toc however this limitation could be overcome by replacing the lamp light source to sunlight energy as a more inexpensive irradiation source alternative comparing a spef system by ye et al 2019 this system has much less energy consumption which is 4 kw h g toc 88 compared to the pef system as energy requirement for light source is eliminated in this spef system having this advantage spef system is commonly inferred to be the best performing ef based process as the system resulted in remarkable pollutant degradation potential and the exposure to sunlight encouraged almost complete mineralisation at no extra cost so this system is rather attractive for larger scale industrial application reactor design reactor design also affects the energy consumed by a particular ef system two pc systems are compared to address this aspect in which vale júnio et al 2018 researched a batch pc system while ren et al 2019 designed a multi stage flow through system with both systems having pretty close cod removal efficiencies 70 72 5 the energy consumption for flow through system is 0 0021 kw h g cod 50 which is much lower compared to the batch system 0 06 kw h g cod 89 this flow through system is more industrial friendly as it has the advantages of low energy consumption and reasonably efficient pollutant mineralisation potential also with the presence of multi stage design energy consumption of an ef system will be directly influenced by the number of stages required to achieve targeted cod removal efficiency 50 hence treating different type of wastewater of different concentration will require different number of stages for efficient treatment process to take place so the energy consumption and cost will also vary from the afore mentioned factors in addition taking example of spef systems reported by ye et al 2019 and fajardo et al 2019 the system designed as filter press flow cell results in higher energy consumption 4 kw h g toc 88 compared to the batch cell process with 0 12 kw h g cod 90 this finding is in contrast to the earlier finding in which for pc system the flow through reactor resulted in lower energy consumption compared to batch system hence it can be concluded that different reactor design along with different process design do lead to varying energy consumption of the system electrode material next type of electrode employed in an ef system does affect the energy consumption of the system as the electrodes both anode and cathode are responsible for producing the oxidant species responsible for pollutant removal mechanisms assessing two classical ef systems the energy consumption is compared per volume of treated wastewater in which 0 21 kw h m3 is consumed through ef system reported by ren et al 2019 while kaur et al 2019 reported 0 789 kw h m3 of energy consumption 91 92 despite numerous aspects that could be contributing to the difference in energy consumption between these two systems but the most obvious factor that is deemed to highly affect their energy consumption is the type of cathode utilised in the system lower energy consumption is expected with the use of a modified electrode graphite felt modified with electrochemically exfoliated graphene eegr and carbon black by ren et al 2019 in comparison to a basic aluminium electrode by kaur et al 2019 the modified graphite felt is believed to be more efficient in generating h2o2 at lower driving current which then contribute to the formation of oh radicals to be utilised for the degradation process of organic pollutants hence this explains the smaller electrical energy requirement in the system with the modified electrode in addition even with capability of cathode to electrogenerate h2o2 some ef systems are designed with external addition of h2o2 instead of cathode modification in order to reduce the energy consumption for generating h2o2 at the cathode this is a good effort to reduce energy consumption but it will create other costs which is the chemical consumption cost as well as the required transportation and storage cost of h2o2 catalyst material the type of catalyst employed in a system also directly influences the efficiency and energy consumption of the system two hef systems are compared in which each system employed different type of heterogeneous catalysts both systems are able to achieve reasonably high pollutant mineralisation efficiencies with reported energy consumption of 18 24 kw h m3 by hammouda et al 2019 using magnetic double perovskite oxide sr2fecuo6 catalyst and 26 91 kw h m3 reported by rosales et al 2019 using chitosan epichlorohydrin with iron iii oxide catalyst other common heterogeneous catalysts that have been attempted by several researchers in ef system are iron zeolite 93 94 pyrite 95 96 and ferro magnetic iron oxide 97 one of the possible reasons for the fairly big difference in energy consumption between the two mentioned systems is the potency difference in diverse type of heterogeneous catalysts utilised in the respective systems these catalysts influence the optimum treatment ph of the system and subsequently the required driving electrical energy hence resulting in different values of current voltage required to achieve ideal treatment efficacy as observed from the listed examples of hef process the system with lower energy consumption has smaller operational current compared to the system with slightly higher energy consumption pollutants variety in addition type of organic pollutants or wastewaters could highly influence the energy consumed by a particular ef system to achieve a specific pollutant removal efficiency referring to a bef system authored by nadais et al 2018 four different pharmaceutical pollutants are treated by this system with each having different removal efficiency ranging from 60 up to 97 98 the calculated energy consumption for this system is 29 8 kw h m3 of treated solution however depending on the type of pollutant being treated by this system this energy consumption could be either too high or satisfactory for example since the removal of diclofenac is rather high using this system 97 the energy consumption to achieve this removal efficiency is acceptable conversely for ketoprofen its low degradation efficiency 61 indicates that higher energy consumption is required in order to achieve a much better degradation efficiency hence this emphasises the varying energy requirement in ef system depending on the recalcitrance of a specific pollutant additionally to increase the attractiveness of a bef system for larger scale implementation the system could be designed without external power supply thus eliminating the reactor energy consumption however this so called mfc bef has the limitation of limited h2o2 as well as lengthy treatment time which are insufficient and inadequate to treat high concentrations of organic pollutants 16 therefore mec bef system is preferred as it demonstrated high h2o2 at lower energy consumed compared to conventional ef system it is also able to treat high concentrations of pops electrochemical treatment time another aspect that directly affects the energy consumption of an ef process is the treatment time in comparison to classical ef system an advanced ef system such as sef is able to operate in a shorter treatment time to degrade a particular organic pollutant or wastewater due to the presence of sonolysis mechanism this mechanism helps to enhance the mineralisation of organic pollutants to achieve high treatment efficiency example of sef process is taken from an article published by hasani et al 2020 with 97 5 of the antibiotic degraded at energy consumption of 2 kw h m3 throughout 81 5 min treatment time 99 this is a great pollutant mineralisation performance achieved at a relatively short treatment time and reasonable amount of energy utilised however in terms of larger scale application this sef system may not be very feasible compared to classical ef system due to the requirement of extra sonication equipment and possible higher energy consumption including energy from sonication equipment variation in electrolyte the choice of appropriate electrolyte is important as it has a significant impact on the efficiency of an ef process through the provision of proper electric current passage the application of a particular electrolyte to an ef system will affect the faradic yield cell voltage and energy consumption in the respective ef reactor 100 in general sodium sulphate na2so4 is known to be the commonly used electrolyte for conductivity enhancement of solutions as per articles in table 5 taking into example articles published by zazou et al 2019 and do vale júnior et al 2018 both compared the efficiency of two types of electrolyte nacl and na2so4 in which ef processes with na2so4 electrolyte are found to be significantly more efficient 89 101 vale júnior et al 2018 reported about 88 colour removal achieved for nacl system and 96 for na2so4 system however in contrast to ef process reported by daneshvar et al 2008 nacl electrolyte in ef system results in better ef reaction rate compared to na2so4 102 in general it is widely noted that presence of cl and s o 4 2 in both chloride and sulphate mediums could lead to the scavenging effect on oh radicals through formation of some species such as organochlorinated products chlorate and perchlorate and sulphate radical 89 hence concentration of electrolyte as well as current applied to ef system are important parameters to control the occurrence rate of oh radicals scavenging reactions energy consumed by an ef system could be optimised through smart decision on electrolyte type and its concentration all in all it can be stated that the correlation between electrolyte and ef efficiency is not always apparent 103 in conclusion it is clear that for some ef based processes the complexity of system configuration and energy costs are the biggest challenge for the large scale industrial application hence optimisation strategies are important to be employed in the design of large scale ef reactors to minimise the aforementioned costs the main cost limiting operational and design components in this ef technology which are deemed to require strategic optimisation are the reactor design current voltage catalysts treatment time operational ph and electrode characteristics these elements are very dependent on each other in which proper design of these elements will lead to highly successful treatment system as well as economically feasible system all in all the systematic refinement of ef s total operational cost will subsequently have influence on compensation of ef s high investment cost which makes it worth to be implemented in large scale 4 current research perspective and future prospects throughout the last two decades the number of publications on ef has grown tremendously with the recent decade 2010 2019 recording significantly higher ef publication growth this shows that ef technology has started to become an important alternative in treating persistent organic pollutants in water bodies with increasing number of ef publications per year it is expected to grow more with wider research areas to be discovered and also mature the current research aspects it is noteworthy that some ef processes like hef and pef have received rather wide attention from researchers worldwide while other processes like pc bef sef could be further developed for wider applications to further improve the potential of various ef processes the following are the important aspects that require further research focus which are expected to mature over time synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts using novel materials for improved ef process heterogeneous catalyst is combined with ef process to form a so called hef process which it is deemed to promote a more versatile ef process having wide operational ph range less sludge formation and heterogeneous catalysts recyclability these heterogeneous catalysts are insoluble and usually comprise iron species to allow fenton reaction to take place they could also contribute to catalysing of h2o2 in ef process as well as acting as the cathode recently more researchers have been attempting to develop highly efficient iron containing synthetic heterogeneous catalysts through the use of various novel resources on its own or supported on microporous and mesoporous materials however persistent problems continue to arise such as agglomeration of non supported magnetic nanoparticles catalysts falling off from supports and abundant catalyst leaching into treated effluents especially those that are toxic even at small concentrations 5 7 112 hence studies on production of catalysts of high stability high catalytic activity and low environmental toxicity are necessary to ensure further advance of this heterogeneous ef process also in terms of economic feasibility low cost catalyst preparation is vital to pave the direction for this hef process into penetrating industrial application so economical and environmentally feasible catalyst synthesis method has been one of the current challenges which require more focus from researchers in this water reclamation field fabrication of electrode for enhanced efficiency and robustness electrodes both anode and cathode play a huge role in determining the efficiency of an ef based process especially for large scale application of ef system electrode material efficiency and life span are the most important aspects that will greatly affect the cost of wastewater treatment generally for cathode porous carbon based electrode and 3 dimensional electrode system is preferred to allow the adsorption of oxygen on the electrode surface for oxygen reduction to h2o2 to take place a number of novel carbon ptfe gde and modified carbon electrodes have been synthesised by several researchers through usage of various carbon and nanocarbon materials along with catalysts impregnation 84 88 113 114 examples of catalyst materials that have been studied are transition metals and allotrope of carbon such as graphene besides cathode for some ef processes anodes are usually made of chemically inert electrodes such as metals or metal oxides in many researches bdd is found to have superior capability as anode material compared to other materials but its high cost is the major drawback for industrial application in fact other precious metal anodes like platinum and silver do not seem appropriate for large scale application so extensive study on electrode materials is crucial in order to produce a highly efficient electrode having high robustness high catalytic activity long life span and high electrode poisoning resistance in addition with respect to carbon based cathode modification materials selection is important for catalyst synthesis on cathode as catalysts are required to show high activity towards 2e orr at low applied potential as for economic point of view optimisation of electrode and catalyst costing could be initiated through innovative fabrication methods as well as large scale production to minimise the preparation cost design of integrated wastewater treatment system comprising ef process with other technology for implementation in various wastewater applications the operating principles of an ef process have made it rather challenging to be implemented as a single unit for any wastewater treatment system in order to exploit its full potential ef process can be coupled with other technology to form an integrated wastewater treatment system past studies have attempted several integrated systems such as ef based processes combined with other electrochemical processes i e electrocoagulation electro oxidation 115 116 ef processes as pre treatment to biological processes 117 118 combination of ef with aops 119 and also ef processes coupled to membrane filtration process 120 from the results of the previous studies the overall performance of these integrated systems has been excellent with the possibility of having lower total operational cost especially energy consumption cost compared to a treatment system with ef process as a sole unit hence having a highly efficient and optimised integrated wastewater treatment system will boost its economic viability for industrial application having two and more technologies coupled to form a system will benefit the ability of the system to degrade wider range of pollutants thus creating a feasible systematic system the study on optimisation of integrated system design could be further explored as it shows promising research path for researchers in ef field scaling up bench lab scale process to pilot plant level suitable for in field application although more in depth studies are still required to further refine this process the ef technology has demonstrated its fair feasibility and readiness to be scaled up to pilot plant level for industrial implementation however not many studies on ef pilot plant have been carried out as most researchers are still focusing on lab scale investigation scaling up ef process has been a major challenge for researchers in this field due to the high risk of the process not operating efficiently at high effluent volume and large electrode dimension however researchers should be enthusiastic in facing this challenge in order to prove the competency of this process in degrading pops in wastewaters at much bigger scale compared to conventional wastewater treatment system scaling up this ef process is an important step before reaching industrial scale application during scale up stage feasibility study has to be executed in terms of operation in continuous mode and treatment of highly polluted wastewater in large volume this is because the findings from most researches carried out in batch lab scale are limited to small volume of wastewater or low concentration synthetic pollutant which do not represent the real circumstances also design of reactor is crucial in making sure a scaled up ef process could be operated efficiently to manage large vigorous wastewater load additionally information on energy consumption for pilot scale configuration is also lacking due to the deficiency in pilot scale study which is why it is crucial research focus analysis of economic cost that is not just limited to energy consumption cost it is well known that economic cost is the restrictive factor for large scale expansion of ef processes in order to overcome this restriction ef process should able to be cost competitive in comparison to current conventional wastewater treatment technology economic cost could be estimated in terms of operational cost and investment for each type of ef process having different optimum operational parameters and reactor design the total cost of the system could vary widely referring to the ef publication data presented in this paper the analysis on economic aspect of ef processes is very limited as it is often left aside in most publications the researchers only considered energy consumption element which is limited to reactor cell as part of their economic analysis discussion while a small number of researchers do also include rough estimation of chemicals and electrode consumption nevertheless this information alone is insufficient to explicitly address the economic feasibility of a system hence in future study detailed information on economic cost of an ef system should be considered in publications taking into account important costing like chemical energy electrode and reactor investment costs life cycle assessment lca of ef process for environmental impacts study it is recommended for the lca to be applied to this ef system in order to evaluate the environmental profile of the system this is an important study especially before ef system is scaled up to avoid any undesirable consequences from the advancement of the system although eaops are known to have immense ability in degrading wide variety of toxic organic pollutants it is important to conduct toxicity assessment on effluents of this ef process to minimise the release of any highly toxic by products depending on type of pollutant or wastewater being treated the various constituents in the solution will lead to the formation of various toxicity levels by products so it is important to evaluate the toxicity of by products formed from this ef treatment so that necessary recovery actions could be taken besides that ef processes will usually produce sludge and it would be rather interesting to include the study on sludge recyclability instead of disposing it sludge produced from the ef processes could be transformed into other usable products such as catalyst so having more focus on the comprehensive study of lca as well as by products toxicity assessments and sludge management will further promote the attractiveness of ef process to be implemented widely in industries 5 concluding remarks ef is undeniably an efficient method for the degradation of persistent organic contaminants in various types of wastewaters its excellent performance has attracted numerous researchers and industrial players to invest in researching about this ef system referring to bibliometric analysis the growth progress of ef processes has been really exciting especially throughout the second decade 2010 2019 this field showed exponential growth in publication with cumulative number of published papers throughout second decade 2010 2019 is about 6 times larger than in first decade 2000 2009 it could be predicted that the number of ef publication in 2020 will continue to grow passing the total publication number in 2019 this large growth is contributed by researchers from about 58 countries with 4 largest contributors which are china spain france and iran both spain and france benefit greatly from their high collaboration network ef research areas have expanded widely during second decade having large variety on study areas such as electrode and catalyst synthesis technology integration process comparison mathematical modelling and ef applications focusing on degradation pathway and toxicity evaluation parameter study electrode comparison and system design also these areas of study are further supported by the keywords analysis showing clear correlation between keywords that related to a particular study area all in all the positive development in nature of study indicates the progressive growth of ef technology as efficient and environmentally feasible water treatment system for toxic pops abatement as for journal analysis most of the highly cited publications are published by journals belong in the top 10 productive journals for ef publication having reasonably high impact factors in addition this escalating ef research growth does not guarantee its viability for bigger scale industrial applications hence economic analysis especially on comparison of energy consumption has been carried out to provide sufficient understanding on the factors affecting energy consumption of an ef system i e reactor design type of ef process operational parameters future works should continue to focus on the afore mentioned areas of study as well as focusing on scaling up the ef processes through scrutinisation of their

13646,acceleration in global industrialisation has led to increasing release of various emerging highly toxic refractory organic pollutants in water bodies these contaminants have been very concerning due to their detrimental impacts on human beings as well as aquatic life even at low concentrations conventional wastewater treatment technology has proven to be ineffective in eliminating these pollutants hence creating substantial attention for a more advanced electro fenton ef technology a systematic bibliometric analysis has been carried out based on scopus database to comprehend the extensive research development of ef technology for the past 2 decades 2000 2019 several aspects were analysed namely general growth trend journal country institutional authorship and keywords

recent decade 2010 2019 highlighting the main ef research areas such as electrode and catalyst synthesis application mathematical modelling technology integration and process comparison energy consumption analysis reveals the substantial impact of various ef operational and design parameters on the energy consumed by ef system which then significantly define its economic viability future

bibliometric analysis wastewater treatment electro fenton research trend vosviewer energy consumption 1 introduction the decline of water resources is becoming an increasingly agonising issue for many parts of the world due to rapid growth of world population as well as rapid industrial advancement subsequently more hazardous and recalcitrant pollutants from daily practices are being released into water bodies resulting in the escalation of water resource contamination for example toxic organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products insecticides pesticides fertilisers dyes and phenolic compounds which are the products of development and human actions are found to be frequently entering water supplies 1 2 most of these organic compounds pose detrimental impacts on human being endocrine disruptions as well as abnormalities in certain aquatic lives 3 since the emergence of various persistent pollutants in water bodies could hardly be restrained and their presence has been confirmed in effluents of conventional treatment plants researches on advanced wastewater treatment technology has been very rigorous to keep up with the worldwide demand for cleaner water 4 5 also the recent tightening of regulations by various environmental monitoring bodies has indicated that effluents from many processes will face difficulties to achieve required discharge standards through treatments with primary methods alone thereby strengthening the demand for advanced wastewater treatment processes 6 therefore apart from settling for conventional wastewater treatment system screening sedimentation physical chemical or biological processes superior and more potent processes have been discovered by researchers in water reclamation field in recent decades several advanced water industry technologies with exceptional capability of destroying the emerging pollutants from highly contaminated wastewaters have been introduced examples of these technologies include advanced oxidation or electrochemical advanced oxidation processes aops eaops membrane separation electrochemical processes adsorption process chemical injection and biological processes 7 9 in addition researches on these water reclamation processes have also been broadened to include the designing of integrated wastewater treatment system combining several technologies to promote process intensification eaops have been gaining steadily increasing popularity as reliable wastewater treatment processes as they are found to be more efficient in removing refractory organic pollutants in water bodies compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes these processes are designed using electrochemical principles in which they have received great attention for their ability in solving water pollution problems and establishing environmental compatibility due to the presence of electrons as the main clean reagent 10 examples of electrochemical processes that have been developed and applied on different wastewaters are electrochemical oxidation electrocoagulation electro fenton ef electrodialysis microbial fuel cell photo electrochemical cell and many others 11 12 focusing on eaops ef is deemed to be the most popular technique due to its simplicity and outstanding performance in degradation of persistent organic pollutants pops as well as water disinfection degradation of toxic organic pollutants is crucial as they are considered detrimental in general even when their presence is at the lowest concentration hence highlighting the immediate vitality of this ef technology 13 through rigorous technical environmental and economical sustainability enhancement this ef process is able to be implemented in wide variety of industries as a highly effective and green water reclamation system 1 1 electro fenton ef process ef process was originally derived from an advanced oxidation process aop using fenton reagent resulting in the reaction between hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous salt fe2 to oxidise organics compounds 7 14 the conventional fenton process was then modified with electrochemical technology resulting in the ef process that has the ability to generate in situ hydrogen peroxide h2o2 at cathode in the presence of oxygen feeding and iron catalyst homogenous or heterogeneous externally added to the effluent the main reactions that take place in this process are as follows 15 1 h2o2 generation o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 hydroxyl radical formation f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o o h based on eq 2 hydroxyl h o radical acts as strong oxidising agent to oxidise organic compounds until they reach total mineralisation i e converted to carbon dioxide water and inorganic ions this hydroxyl radical is recognised as the second strongest oxidising agent after fluorine with a standard reduction potential of e h o h2o 2 8 v she thus explaining its outstanding performance in destroying most organic and organo metallic pollutants 10 besides that advanced ef processes have also been developed to further expand the performance of this ideology in water reclamation field these include photoelectron fenton pef peroxi coagulation pc sonoelectro fenton sef solar photo electro fenton spef bioelectro fenton bef and fered fenton ff 7 10 16 17 these technologies have been innovatively designed by researchers and investigated on different types of recalcitrant wastewaters or synthetic persistent organic pollutants effluents such as pharmaceutical pesticides dyes landfill leachate agriculture abattoir food and textile the efficiency of these ef based processes as compelling wastewater treatment method has attracted huge attention from academic researchers as well as industrial players to continuously invest in perfecting these technologies moreover ef process is more superior to other conventional wastewater treatment processes due to advantages such as considerably simple process design low installation cost highly efficient cod and pollutant abatement promote higher biodegradability of treated wastewater and unnecessary storage of dangerous h2o2 6 7 17 19 however there are several challenges that need to be overcome to improve the attractiveness of this process for larger industrial application for example the requirement of suitable electrolyte for different types of wastewater effluent very low operating ph high energy consumption electrical and also the possible evolution of hazardous side products in treated water 6 11 despite the challenges ef process is generally known to be environmentally friendly with no production of secondary pollutants however in cases where overall pollutant mineralisation is not achieved toxic organic or inorganic products could be generated 20 so suggested key aspects towards promoting highly efficient ef process for water reclamation lie on the energy consumption feasibility operating ph cathode and catalyst stability in continuous process h2o2 generation abatement capability of extensive range of organic pollutants minimised toxic by products formation and combination of this process with other technologies hence it is rather difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of a particular ef process without analysing the combination of these key aspects extensive researches have been conducted by researchers from different parts of the world on this ef technology for remediation of contaminated water this is proven by the emerging number of review papers published on this technology various aspects have been discussed in these published papers such as parameters influence advancement of fenton chemistry to ef processes introduction of heterogeneous catalysts in ef processes and application of these processes to wide variety of wastewaters or pollutants table 1 shows the list of top 17 highly cited review papers obtained from scopus focusing on ef processes from the past years although there are other highly cited review papers with slight discussion on ef those papers are not included here as the focus of the papers is mainly on performance comparison between several electrochemical chemical processes instead of emphasising ef or fenton chemistry development it is also worth mentioning that ef focused review papers are not the only papers included in the fore mentioned table some publications focusing on aops or specific pollutants with considerably significant discussion on ef technology are also included so referring to the listed review papers in table 1 they are deemed to extensively discuss ef processes as well as the classical fenton processes to highlight the advance of this fenton chemistry in producing safe treated water the most cited review paper by pignatello et al 2006 had extensively discussed the theory of fenton mechanisms as well as highlighting the shift of fenton process from fenton reagents injection system to in situ fenton reagents generation system using ef processes this paper is important to instil sufficient understanding for future researchers on the crucial principles of this fenton technology it can also be observed that most of the highly cited papers had reviewed the influence of design and operational parameters on ef processes which mostly take into account some factors such as reactor design electrode material catalyst concentration working ph and current density also almost all review papers discuss and summarise the application of these ef processes on different types of real wastewaters and emerging organic pollutants to investigate the development of this eoap throughout the years besides that increasing number of researchers have been focusing on the study of various heterogeneous catalysts materials in ef technology due to its capability in resolving several classical ef process drawbacks these catalysts are described as solid iron catalyst from various sources instead of classical soluble fe2 salts to promote catalytic generation of ho radicals in uncontrolled ph conditions 21 22 some of the desirable features of this heterogeneous electro fenton hef process are extended operational ph range recyclability of catalyst and reduction of iron hydroxide sludge formation 23 24 these observations highlight the great focus shown by numerous researchers on the application and efficiency improvement of these ef processes in wastewater treatment study generally the number of ef review papers being published during recent years of 2018 and 2019 is noticeably higher compared to the previous years totalling 16 papers during these 2 years table s1 supplementary information represents the list of ef related review papers published in the aforementioned 2 years in which these papers have been cited at least once the review aspect of these papers is still concentrating on the influence of operational parameters in ef processes but it can be observed that more focus is now given to the study of heterogeneous catalysts or nano catalysts electrode modification reactor configurations and pollution degradation mechanisms possibility of toxic side products formation of different types of ef processes moreover instead of focusing only on classical fenton and ef process there is also growing interest among researchers on perfecting the more advanced ef based processes such as pef spef bef and hef therefore as additional value to the published technical review papers it is essential to have a strategic summary on the existing researches of this ef technology to capture the research trends of this technology in relation to water reclamation field 25 bibliometric analysis bibliometric study is a powerful statistical tool with the capability to map publications around the world on a specific research field the bibliometric analysis will help to assist in identifying the established or emerging research areas of a particular discipline thus evaluating and quantifying the growth of the literatures published 38 39 besides that this bibliometric method is also useful in recognising cooperation patterns between performance and research patterns of journals authors countries and institutions 40 41 this tool has gained increasing popularity in the recent years as it is found to be useful in the trend study of many disciplines such as social science 40 42 environmental science 39 41 medicine 43 44 engineering 45 46 art and humanities 47 economics 38 and energy 48 in view of this study the most recent advances as well as the current gaps of a particular research field could be emphasised vividly therefore the past current and forthcoming research outlook could be outlined as a guide for researchers in a particular field in relation to ef technology to the best of our knowledge there is a gap in statistical research trend information using bibliometric analysis even though there are reasonably high number of review papers being published on this topic as mentioned in section 1 1 considering the budding research interest in ef based processes as pollutant degradation incentive it is crucial to produce a quantitative bibliometric study on this topic in order to ease the selection of future study areas it is emphasised that this study is aimed for the evaluation of ef technology derived from the published academic literature database using bibliometric analysis technique a thorough summary of researches on this technology is carried out by analysing the related published literatures in scopus database from year 2000 2019 for the years prior to 2000 the number of publications is not significant with a total of only 9 publications during the four year period of 1996 1999 hence recent publications of year 2000 2019 are highlighted as they represented more updated research work the keywords searched in scopus are narrowed to electro fenton and peroxi coagulation the electro fenton keyword resulted in the formation of a database comprising all desired published literatures related to ef technology such as classical ef pef spef bef sef and many other advanced ef based processes subsequently the keyword peroxi coagulation was added on top of electro fenton due to some authors using this term in their publications without specifying the keyword ef even though this peroxi coagulation process is part of ef technology through refined procedure of extracting relevant ef articles 1258 articles are found to be highly appropriate for further analysis detailed procedure of extracting articles from scopus is presented by figure s1 supplementary information abstracts are screened to categorise the journal articles on different nature of study and publication subject area statistical data analysis is carried out with respect to year country journal and institution aspects while bibliometric network analysis is executed for a number of aspects such as keywords occurrences co authorship and country collaboration for this analysis interpretation and visualisation are carried out using vosviewer software these aspects are deemed to be able to provide clear insights of current ef research progress as well as predict emerging research prospects 1 2 economic analysis universally cost is one of the many important aspects in our current society focusing on the application of this ef technology in industrial level it is crucial to have a comprehensive comparison on the performance and the cost of these ef processes as these help to decide on the best ef application strategy in order to increase the competitiveness of eaops against conventional wastewater treatment systems for implementation in larger industrial scale limitations in terms of process performance design and cost operational and design have to be overcome focus is put on processes related to ef technology which is not limited to the classic ef process but also involves many other innovative ef processes such as sef pef hef spef pc and bef generally with reference to the aforementioned processes operating cost is comprised of several crucial aspects such as energy consumption chemicals and electrodes utilisation along with other ancillary aspects such as maintenance labour sludge dewatering and disposal and other fixed costs 49 despite the various cost contribution elements the focus of this economic evaluation section will be on the operational element that has the largest contribution to the total operational cost of a particular ef process which is the energy consumption economic analysis of ef processes was carried out on several articles published within the last three years 2018 2020 the articles extracted for this economic analysis are ensured to have reasonable evaluation on the energy consumption aspect of an ef process at least one article is included for each type of ef based processes energy consumption could be represented in terms of energy consumed per toc removal cod removal or volume of treated effluent the general electrical energy consumption eec formulas are shown as follows 50 3 e e c k w h k g c o d o r t o c 1000 u i t c v 4 e e c k w h m 3 1000 u i t v u voltage v i current a t electrolysis time h v volume of wastewater l c cod or toc removed mg l all in all the study on ef s economic evaluation is essential due to the fact that the development of an efficient yet simple and cost effective process is still a major challenge for researchers and industries 51 even with the presence of considerably strong argument from technical and environment standpoint for a particular ef process a compelling argument from economical viewpoint is still compulsory without convincing arguments from these three aspects technical environmental and economic the adoption of ef technology in industries will continue to be slow moving 2 bibliometric analysis 2 1 general growth trend the general growth trend of the ef published articles per year are graphically represented into two separate graphs to distinguish the publication growth between the first decade 2000 2009 and the second decade 2010 2019 fig 1 shows the publication growth trend for the first decade 2000 2009 it could be seen that during the first decade the number of ef articles being published have stable increment especially from 2006 to 2009 from 2000 2004 the number of ef publications per year is quite low with no apparent trend this could represent the start up phase as its publication trend is rather unstable through the abstracts analysis it was deemed that the ef studies during this phase were only focusing on application of ef process on several types of pollutants or wastewaters as well as the study of degradation pathway with respect to the treated pollutants the study on degradation pathway is important in order to identify the intermediates formed during degradation process especially on their toxicity and how they are broken down to final products which are water carbon dioxide and inorganic minerals also there is noticeable focus of study on process comparison during this phase for example there are articles comparing different types of ef processes as well as comparison with classical fenton based processes or anodic oxidation process then from 2005 to 2009 there is a steady increase in number of ef publications with huge increment observed in 2007 during these years the research on ef technology has started to gain more attention from some researchers the popular areas of study are similar to previous years but with higher interest on the study of the impact of parameters on the performance of ef processes in treating various pops and wastewaters examples of the operational parameters being studied are applied current iron catalyst dosing initial ph electrolysis time oxygen sparging rate and type of iron catalyst 52 55 now referring to fig 2 representing ef publication growth in the second decade 2010 2019 a significant increase in the number of ef publications per year is observed a slightly slow increment is seen from year 2010 2012 then year 2013 onwards shows a better increasing trend indicating the start of booming phase from year 2015 onwards the number of published articles exceeded 100 publications per year implying that this ef technology is beginning to receive higher recognition among researchers in this water reclamation technology field during this phase the nature of study for this ef technology has become more diverse with more attention given on other areas of research besides the previously mentioned study areas additional nature of study areas were enhanced such as electrode and heterogeneous catalyst synthesisation integrated wastewater treatment processes mathematical modelling for process optimisation purpose electrode comparison and also innovative process or reactor design for the papers published before 2010 these areas of study have been attempted by some researchers but huge focus was not gained during those years in 2015 the study of electrode and catalyst synthesisation began to receive significant attention from many researchers hef process is gaining increasing attention due to its efficacy in degrading organic pollutants at wide ph range and limited metal leaching during catalyst recycle 56 also cathode synthesis has been a significantly important approach of increasing performance of ef process in terms of h2o2 generation in particular thus this explains the emerging number of publications reporting on electrode synthesis for instance graphene coated electrode 57 58 transition metal embedded electrode 59 60 and nitrogen doped electrode 61 62 for year 2018 2019 there is a considerably big jump in the number of published ef articles compared to 2017 which is from 130 to 182 and 215 respectively during these 2 years besides the study on synthesisation of electrodes and catalysts these articles are also reporting on other areas of study such as process optimisation mathematic modelling processes comparison processes integration reactor and process design the steady increase in these areas of study has revealed the growing researchers attention in discovering this ef process at greater depth in general it is rather obvious from fig 1 that during the first decade 2000 2009 the cumulative number of ef publications is 175 while in the second decade 2010 2019 shown in fig 2 a total of 1084 published papers is recorded which is about 6 times higher than previous decade this observation could be linked to the core purpose of this ef technology which is to degrade persistent and emerging organic pollutants especially since these persistent pollutants are able to be detected using advanced technology this explains the increasing consciousness to remove these emerging refractory pollutants examples of conventional and emerging technology for persistent organic pollutants detection are high performance liquid chromatography hplc gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa and fluorescence spectroscopy 63 overall the witnessed growth evolution of ef articles is undeniably spectacular hence highlighting the breakthrough of research in ef technology through diversification of ef study areas in 2020 the number of ef publications is expected to exceed 200 assuming the rising trend in fig 2 is maintained 2 2 journal analysis a total of 1258 ef related journal articles were published in 236 journals between the years 2000 2019 referring to fig 3 of the 236 journals analysed 89 is accounted for by journals with 10 and less publications over a period of two decades these journals are categorised in group a remaining 4 and 7 represented journals with more than 30 publications each group b and journals with number of publications between 11 30 each group c respectively now when scrutinising the number of ef articles published by journals in each group group b contributed the most ef articles which is 43 from a total of 1258 articles even though this group represents the least number of journals which is 10 as for group a and c each contributed 36 and 19 of the total published articles respectively eventually for clarity purpose of this analysis only journals of group b are selected for further analysis in this section as they are deemed to be of top 10 most productive journals in ef publications although there is a significantly huge number of journals in group a 89 their low average ef publication per journal does not represent their productivity fig 4 represents the top 10 most productive journals in ef publications throughout the two decades 2000 2019 along with their respective if from this plot it is clear that the top three most productive journals are electrochimica acta if 5 383 85 publications chemosphere if 5 108 76 publications and hazardous materials if 7 65 73 publications the figure also differentiates the number of literatures published by each journal during the first decade 2000 2009 and second decade 2010 2019 during the first decade the number of publications per journal is approximately 20 or less which is rather low in this decade the three journals with most publications are journal of hazardous material if 7 65 20 publications water research if 7 913 14 publications and chemosphere ef 5 108 13 publications however for publications in second decade each journal managed to contribute more than 65 publications of the total publication in the second decade this indicates that the publications in second decade have proven to be more significant towards contributing to the productivity of each journal during this second decade the top 3 journals are found to be slightly different from the overall and first decade top journals which are electrochimica acta if 5 383 74 publications chemosphere ef 5 108 63 publications and chemical engineering journal if 8 355 56 publications furthermore out of 19 subject categories enlisted for these ef publications environmental science topped with 58 16 followed by chemistry 48 72 and chemical engineering 42 45 these main subject categories further support the publication scopes of the aforementioned top three journals in which electrochimica acta focused on works in the field of electrochemistry chemosphere on environmental science as well as engineering and chemical engineering journal which focused on environmental chemical engineering along with materials synthesisation next for thorough journal analysis focus was on the top 3 most productive journals during the second decade the growth in publication number for these journals is related to the progress trend of different nature of study of this ef technology which is further discussed in this section generally the nature of ef study could be categorised into several aspects for example electrode catalyst synthesis technology integration electrochemical process comparison mathematical modelling and ef application to wastewater focusing on type of pollutant electrode diversity parameter study process design and degradation pathway table s2 supplementary information demonstrates the anticipated nature of study in ef published articles along with its brief description getting into the main focus of this journal analysis fig 5 depicts the growth in ef publications for the fore mentioned three most productive journals from the year 2010 2019 sudden peak on publication number is observed in 2018 and slightly dropped in 2019 even with the fall in number of publications for these 3 journals the number of overall ef publications could be seen increasing in 2019 as per fig 2 this could be explained by the emerging interest of other journals in publishing ef literatures which support the huge overall ef publications in 2019 throughout 2018 the spike in chemosphere journal publication is very obvious as number of publications showed a four fold increase within a year as seen in fig 6 this increment is thought to be contributed by the research on synthesisation of electrode and catalyst as well as the study on comparison between advanced electro oxidation processes this synthesis study refers to the discovery of novel materials for cathode modification and also the fabrication of various heterogeneous catalysts to enhance the performance of ef processes overall throughout the whole decade starting in 2010 chemosphere journal publications are deemed to be focused on the fundamental aspect of ef technology which are the study of process comparison and pollutant s degradation mechanism observed from the ongoing publication of these studies throughout most of the years next the most productive journal with highest ef publication is the electrochimica acta journal in which the number of published ef articles peak in 2015 and 2016 which is 2 3 years earlier compared to chemosphere journal from this observation electrochimica acta journal is believed to be responsible for promoting the popularity of ef study in terms of synthesisation and process comparison which then triggers chemosphere journal to escalate its ef article publications related to this nature of study scanning through from the peak year 2015 2019 the dominant nature of study that managed to gain high publication in this electrochimica acta journal are the synthesis electrochemical process comparison and the process design this trend entails that most of the articles accepted by this journal are focusing on both fundamental and pioneering studies to further enhance the potential of ef process lastly from fig 5 the third top journal which is chemical engineering journal recorded one sharp peak in ef publication which occurred in 2013 based on fig 6 the majority of papers published during the peak year are of synthesis and process comparison nature of study in which this observation is similar to the two previously discussed journals chemosphere and electrochimica acta so comparing all three top journals it seems that chemical engineering journal is the first journal which increased its number of publications on synthesisation study in 2013 followed by electrochimica acta in 2014 and finally chemosphere in 2018 this development of catalyst and electrode synthesisation as well as process comparison has encouraged researchers to venture into more areas of study which then led to apparent growth in ef publication of different nature of study in this chemical engineering journal as per fig 5 a stable increase in publication from these journals since 2015 indicates the increase in the number of published articles of other nature of study such as sequential treatment integration electrode comparison parameters influence and also process or reactor design scrutinising on the nature of articles published by all three journals during the most recent years which are 2018 and 2019 it appears that the interest of ef study is inclining towards synthesisation and electrode study for electrochimica acta journal as shown from some of the publications 64 66 as for chemosphere journal the focus of study is inclined towards process comparison and electrode catalyst synthesisation or modification 67 69 while for chemical engineering journal sequential treatment integration and synthesisation are the focused area of study during these recent two years 70 72 referring to the observed publication trend and published articles nature of study from these three major journals it can be concluded that the current interest of this ef study is inclined towards the exploration of environmentally friendly materials for synthesisation of highly efficient electrode and heterogeneous catalysts these new advanced materials are anticipated to be continuously developed for enhanced electrochemical h2o2 production and more testing required to evaluate long term stability of cathode materials 73 in addition to increasing discovery of nanomaterials application in aops the development of economic and eco friendly process for nanomaterials formation that is suitable for environmental applications is also becoming one of the focuses of this ef study 74 all of these studies are viewed as an effort to encourage innovation among researchers which will result in the establishment of highly competent and more advanced ef processes it is also noticed that the total number of publications for these three journals dropped from 49 in 2018 to 33 in 2019 deduction drawn from this observation is that the lab scale research of ef technology has started to reach saturation point hence implying the need for pilot scale study and real life implementation this interpretation is supported by oonnittan and sillanpä 2012 and nidheesh zhou and oturan 2018 in which these researchers agreed that scaling up these eaops remains a major challenge that must be overcome to accomplish the real implementation of this technology 20 31 for the reason of justifying the highly attended nature of study for ef publications top 10 ef publications during the first and second decade is examined table s3 supplementary information and table s4 supplementary information reveal the fore mentioned publications from the enlisted articles it is perceived that most of these highly cited papers are published by the top 10 productive journals presented in fig 4 in which these journals have reasonably high if focusing on the nature of study of the highly cited articles for both decades the study on process comparison seems to gain highest interest among researchers the possible explanation for this observation is the inquisitiveness of researchers in exploring the competitiveness of several emerging eaops through the analysis on many aspects such as pollutant degradation efficiency kinetic rate constant and electrical energy consumption 75 76 also it is noticed that the enlisted top cited published ef papers cover almost all study areas suggested in this analysis as per table s2 supplementary information except two study areas which are synthesis and integration this is because these two study areas only started to gain popularity during middle of the second decade hence these articles have not been able to reach the list of highly cited publications as a certain period of time is required to build up the citation count 2 3 country and institution analysis in general through the data obtained from scopus 58 different countries have contributed to ef publication among those countries 14 have more than 20 ef publications each which are recognised as top productive countries and include five asian countries four american countries three european countries and two african countries this enlisted top 14 countries is presented in table s5 supplementary information it is to be noted that some publications can be related to more than one country due to collaborations between researchers and institutions from different parts of the world from this table it could be seen that the top 4 countries with remarkably high publications above 100 are china 443 followed by spain 212 france 165 and iran 103 also it is obvious that there is quite a large jump in publication number between china and second most productive country spain which is about a 2 fold difference referring to fig 7 it is noticed that spain and france are the first two countries to publish ef articles during the first two years 2000 and 2001 with somewhat similar publication trend throughout most years in 2002 china researchers started publishing ef articles which its publication trend appearing to increase rapidly as of 2005 thus overtaking the two aforementioned countries also from 2017 2019 it is obvious that the number of publications by china spiked up intensely making it the dominant country in this ef research highest publication by china is recorded in 2019 95 publications in which this publication record is about 4 6 times larger compared to the number of ef publications in the same year by three other countries spain france iran this high productivity by china could be ascribed to the huge support and high amount of research funding from china government on wastewater treatment technology development also with respect to high environmental awareness and more stringent regulation standards in china various industries as well as researchers have been challenging themselves to seek for appropriate wastewater treatment technologies 77 since china is one of the developing countries facing high water shortages this water technology study could lead a way out for china from its position as one of the thirteen countries in the world with poorest per capita water resources 78 next observing the publication trend by iran it shows that publication of ef articles only started in 2008 the lagging of ef publication in iran shows that this technology only started to gain the attention of iranian researchers after a prominent number of ef articles establishing this technology s exquisiteness has been enthusiastically published overall the total number of ef publications for each year from these 4 most productive countries accounted for approximately 55 100 of the total yearly ef publications figure s2 supplementary information illustrates the collaboration network between the top 14 most productive countries in ef research as can be seen in the diagram the top 4 productive countries china spain france and iran are displayed in larger circles compared to the rest of the listed countries this denotes the large number of ef articles published by these leading countries compared to others additionally table 2 summarises the collaboration strength between the top 14 countries as well as the citation scores of the countries publications for each country the number of links portrays the number of countries a particular country had collaborated with the top three countries with highest collaboration network 9 links are spain france and united states while the countries with lowest collaboration link number 3 links is recorded for taiwan and iran both spain and france demonstrate high total link strength which are 105 and 123 respectively indicating that these two countries have the most extensive and strong research collaboration with other countries also citation number and normalised citation score are used to analyse the quality of ef research work and publications by each of the countries it can be observed that although china has the most ef publications its number of citations is lower than that of spain and france the high citation number obtained by spain and france could be attributed to the high presence of ef literatures published by these countries at early stage of ef research year 2000 2004 these early stage publications help the countries to gain a great number of citations due to the likelihood of the published articles to be treated as guidance source by other researchers since china only started to produce much higher ef publication recently year 2017 2019 the citation number is still increasing and has not received much attention from researchers this explains the lower citation number obtained by china compared to spain and france moreover the normalised citation number gained by china shows the highest score 425 63 which is far ahead compared to spain and france this observation denotes the ef publications from china do receive reasonably significant referencing by other researchers as for other countries listed in table 2 the normalised citation scores are much lower than the top 3 productive countries but still adequately good in which the scores are in the range of 24 72 based on scopus database 160 institutions have recorded the publication of ef articles the top 15 most productive institutions in terms of publication number are listed in table 3 each of these institutions has produced more than 20 publications in two decades time 2000 2019 of these eight are chinese two are spanish and french and one each are taiwanese iranian and turkish the top 3 institutions with more than 100 publications are led by universitat de barcelona spain 149 publications followed by université paris est france 115 publications and ministry of education china china 105 publications each of these top 3 most productive institutions represented the top 3 productive countries in the contribution to ef publications in some countries the establishment of water related research centre had encouraged the formation of a hub in which researchers will pool their resources to conduct various aspects of study on the ef technology hence this tactic will help to elevate the institution s research productivity and reputation as well as its publication number this explains the certain occurrence in which a particular institution of a particular country is able to be listed as one of the top most productive institutions but overall the country s total publication number is not very significant besides that it is noticed that certain countries with reasonably high publication number above 60 publications such as brazil india and mexico do not have any of their institutions shortlisted as one of the top 15 productive institutions this is probably because in such countries research is not led by a single research centre in which majority of the ef publications originates from a particular centre instead many institutions across the country are publishing the ef articles hence it is not possible to highlight the number of ef publications from each of the institutions to summarise it could be extracted from the results in table 2 and table 3 that there is important correlation along with rational justification between the most significant institutions and the most productive countries 2 4 authorship analysis this authorship analysis bestows recognition to individuals that are deemed to have made significant research contribution to ef technology throughout two decades time 2000 2019 therefore 10 most productive authors in terms of number of published ef articles have been listed in table 4 it is seen that the authors listed are from the mentioned top 3 most productive countries which are china spain and france out of the 10 listed authors spain dominated with the highest number of prolific authors 7 authors followed by france 2 authors and china 1 author a fascinating observation is made on these authors as most of them are affiliated to the similar university of each country the huge research focus towards ef study displayed by the spanish researchers from universitat de barcelona resulted in the university being the most productive institution in this ef investigation as per table 3 in section 2 3 as for the french authors both of them are associated with the same institution in the country université paris est while the sole productive chinese author in this list represented nankai university china in general the countries and institutions associated with these top 10 most prolific authors agreed with the productive countries and institutions recorded in the previous section fig 8 portrays the co authorship network between top 27 productive researchers in ef technology study this collaboration network does not represent the overall collaboration for all authors as this analysis was limited to a number of highly productive authors with more than 15 ef publications the three biggest clusters observed along with their respective leading authors are as follows red cluster leading author brillas e green cluster leading author oturan m a and blue cluster leading author rodriguez r m these authors portray high number of co authorship connection more than 10 links per author and reasonably strong collaboration link strength with their co authors which highlights their extensive research collaboration activity the information on authors collaboration strength and citation score is presented in table 4 the term link refers to the number of co authors a particular author is connected to while the term total link strength refers to the overall extensiveness of the author s collaboration activity which is displayed through the thickness of the link curves it is worthwhile mentioning that since this collaboration network is limited to top 27 authors the number of collaborations number of links and collaboration strength total link strength did not represent the real co authors relationship between each researcher in this ef study from both table 4 and collaboration network brillas e is the most influential author with highest number of collaborations among the highly productive authors 17 collaborations as well as having huge leap in collaboration strength 325 compared to the other authors this is a very expected observation since brilllas e is known to be the developer of this ef technology in which this statement is supported with the largest citation number and normalised citation score 219 62 obtained by him since brillas e is affiliated with universitat de barcelona this explains the significant number of ef researchers coming from the same university besides that two french authors oturan m a and oturan n who are linked to the same french institution have managed to also dominate this research area as both attain rather significant collaboration strength 172 and 170 and competitively high normalised citation score 214 83 and 185 25 respectively as for the chinese author zhou m who is among the top 10 productive authors in this ef research this is a rather noteworthy achievement as china only started to show interest in this ef technology two years after spain and france 2 5 keywords analysis author keywords are phrases that define the field or research issue of a publication relevant keywords are required to be outlined by authors to ensure a particular publication is able to attract researchers from the same research field hence increasing its citation score with respect to the ef study bibliometric data analysed resulted in a total of 2209 author keywords the occurrence of the keywords is set to above 5 minimum occurrence of 6 resulting in 129 items generated into keywords co occurrence network visualisation as per fig 9 each keyword is represented by a circle and the size of the circle highlighted the occurrences of the keywords the larger the circle the more frequent a particular keyword being used in ef publications the connection links between keywords show the co occurrences of the connected keywords the strength of a link between specific keywords can be assessed from the thickness of its link curve as expected the term electro fenton dominated the author keywords having largest occurrence in publications represented by largest circle and widest linkage with other keywords represented by number of links and link strength besides that as noticed the author keywords have been classified into three clusters cluster 1 red cluster 2 green and cluster 3 blue keywords of the same colour cluster suggested reasonably similar topic discussed by the respective publications referring to the three main clusters appropriate ef subfield categorisation could be allocated based on the dominating keywords in the respective clusters in cluster 1 red keywords such as electrocoagulation peroxi coagulation electrooxidation cod electro fenton ef dye removal catalysis treatment landfill leachate and coking wastewater are seemingly related to the study of efficacy comparison between several electrochemical processes in treating various wastewaters and pollutants as for keywords in cluster 2 green they represent the study of advanced ef processes and the toxicity of oxidation side products produced by primarily pharmaceutical products this area of study is indicated by the use of keywords such as anodic oxidation solar photoelectro fenton oxidation products boron doped diamond electrochemical advanced oxidation solar light photoelectrocatalysis photoelectron fenton process ciprofloxacin and tetracycline next the keywords in cluster 3 blue symbolise the study of cathode synthesisation and modification to promote highly competent ef process example of the implied keywords are graphite felt modification activated carbon fiber graphene electrochemical oxidation carbon felt three dimensional electrode carbon nanotube oxygen reduction reaction current efficiency and energy consumption besides the term electro fenton there are several other terms that received reasonably high occurrences in ef publications which are photoelectron fenton 75 occurrences water treatment 76 occurrences anodic oxidation 73 occurrences degradation 73 occurrences mineralization 112 occurrences and hydroxyl radical 81 occurrences hydroxyl radical and anodic oxidation are part of key pollutant removal mechanisms in the ef process hence these keywords are largely used by the authors it can be said that these keywords are among the fundamental terms in ef publications with application to water treatment field also the keyword photoelectron fenton gained quite high popularity as an advanced ef process due to its high efficacy in mineralising more persistent organic pollutants such as pharmaceutical drugs and dyes it is defended by numerous researchers that in many occasions pef have demonstrated greater pollutant removal potential compared to classical ef process 7 31 besides that referring to the keyword hydrogen peroxide 76 occurrences in blue cluster this crucial fenton reagent is designed to be generated from cathode of an ef system it may well be argued that the success of this ef technology rests heavily on the properties and characteristic of cathode some of the cathode properties heavily focused by researchers are three dimensional structure oxygen reduction current efficiency energy consumption and hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration these keywords are visualised in fig 9 in addition ef technology has been widely tested on many types of synthetic or real wastewaters and pollutants while some types of pollutants have not been thoroughly treated with this technology quite a number have been the focus of researchers such as landfill leachate pharmaceutical dye pesticides and coking wastewater as per fig 9 furthermore looking into keywords analysis in terms of publication years figure s3 and figure s4 portray the visualisations of author keywords based on average publications per year score during the first decade 2000 2009 of keywords analysis most of the keywords only stood out starting in 2008 2009 this is supported by the publication growth trend in fig 1 from section 2 1 showing that the ef publication number only started to be significant during the year 2008 2009 hence majority of the keywords gain their recognition from the publications that have been made throughout these two years subsequently for second decade 2010 2019 keywords analysis the keywords occurrences could be categorised into 3 periods which are early decade 2010 2013 mid decade 2014 2016 and end decade 2017 2019 during the early decade numerous publications presented keywords such as oxidation products degradation pathway cod chemical oxygen demand kinetic model and experimental design from these keywords it is implied that during this period the ef scope of study is focusing more on the fundamentals parameter study of ef technology and its capability in treating various pollutants with minimal production of environmentally toxic side products during mid decade the focus of ef study is seen to be slightly shifted towards process integration and comparison of different wastewater treatment technology this observation is rather similar to the nature of study trend for ef publications shown in chemosphere and electrochimica acta journals in fig 6 the gain in popularity of several advanced ef processes such as pc pef spef and bef can also be perceived during this period all these statements are supported by the keywords visualised in figure s4 which are photoelectrocatalysis solar photoelectron fenton peroxi coagulation electrochemical oxidation and microbial fuel cell finally during the end decade the keywords that stand out more are oxygen reduction reaction graphite felt activated carbon graphene and heterogeneous catalyst these terms confirmed that during this period the area of study of this ef subject is more focused towards synthesising heterogeneous catalysts as well as cathode modification this analysis on nature of ef study from year 2017 2019 highly supports the finding obtained in section 2 2 3 energy consumption analysis ordinarily operational cost of ef technology is highly influenced by the energy consumption chemical utilisation and electrode consumption of a particular system table 5 listed several selected articles having cost estimation analysis carried out on the respective ef systems subject to the design of a particular ef process to achieve a specific pollutant removal efficiency range its total operational cost could be incredibly high or reasonably favourable it is observed from the table that the two main costing features with biggest contribution to the total operational cost of an ef system are energy consumption and chemical especially fenton reagents costs it is deduced that in an electrochemical technology electrical energy consumption is more crucial than chemical cost as it is part of the compulsory design of this technology meanwhile the cost of externally injected fenton reagents could be regarded as an option depending on the design of a particular ef system having significant impact on the ef system s economic viability this energy consumption attribute could be controlled through the regulation of other aspects of the technology such as chemical usage planning as well as electrode choice in order to promote this technology into a cost effective pollutant mineralisation tool in short energy cost could vary widely as it highly depends on the type of wastewater effluent being treated operational parameters and design of the electrochemical reactor generally it is noticed that the major operational cost of this ef technology is predominant due to the amount of energy required for its operation 51 one of the possible justifications is the electrogeneration of h2o2 instead of being supplied externally hence justifying the need of high electrical energy usage this energy consumption aspect is also an important evaluation for pollutant mineralisation process as it could vary along the efficiency of a particular ef process in mineralising a specific pollutant chemical utilisation in ef processes comprises the following activities ph alteration through acid or base dosing salt solution addition for conductivity control hydrogen peroxide addition fe ii catalyst injection heterogeneous catalysts dosing and air oxygen sparging among these chemicals the two main focus are the fe ii catalyst and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in which these two are defined as fenton reagents in comparison to fenton based chemical process this ef process provides better alternative in terms of costs and risks associated with the production mobilisation and storage of the fenton reagents 84 in ef technology hydrogen peroxide h2o2 could be electrogenerated on site at cathode through the 2 electron reduction reaction of oxygen while fe ii catalyst can be supplied from iron anode or regenerate from cathodic reduction of fe iii at cathode however depending on the design of an ef system some systems do still maintain externally supplied fe ii fe iii and h2o2 to ef reactor either continuously or as initial boost step only in relation to h2o2 being generated on site at cathode for oxidation of pollutants this ideology has been increasingly attracting lots of attention from researchers as well as industrial players as stated by martínez huitle et al 2015 the increasing focus towards this on site h2o2 generation could be explained by the attractive opportunity of reducing h2o2 supply cost associated with h2o2 production storage transportation and handling 85 this viewpoint is supporting the claim in section 2 2 of bibliometric analysis in which the study of cathode and catalyst synthesisation for advanced h2o2 generation is observed to grown in popularity during the recent two years 2018 and 2019 electrode consumption is referring to the life expectancy and reusability of a particular electrode with respect to electrode dissolution chemical poisoning and corrosion attack on electrode s surface also the choice of electrode s materials both anode and cathode contributes to the costing of an ef process the dilemma on the choice of electrode in terms of cost stability and size is quite complex for example as anode the electrode of precious metals and bdd boron doped diamond are expensive and the application of these electrodes in full scale application of wastewater remediation may not be very realistic 7 however the usage of inexpensive anodes may not be the best choice as some of these electrodes are electrochemically less stable as for cathode responsible for this ef process the crucial aspects that needed to be taken into account are the robustness of the electrode to withstand vigorous wastewater as well as the capability of the electrode to efficiently generate h2o2 so it is worth mentioning that cathode imparts high impact to ef processes as it affects h2o2 generation and the reusability performance of the cathode highly influence the costing of these processes 86 also size of electrode has to be optimised while the usage of small sized highly precious electrode may save on the cost of electrode it may also increase the energy cost of an ef process due to long electrolysis treatment duration hence proper economic evaluation is required in order to compromise between affordable cost of electrode reasonable electrode size and high electrode stability lifetime after all the activity of both anode and cathode cannot be overlooked as anode produces hydroxyl radical oh or iron ions fe2 while cathode generates h2o2 for ef processes to take place table 6 represents the example of ef articles in which the authors include a small part of economic evaluation in their publications as expected most authors tend to focus on energy consumption cost as it usually covers the largest percentage of total operational cost of an ef system there are a number of ways in which energy consumption could be measured for example energy consumption per volume of wastewater treated kwh m3 energy consumption per cod removed kwh kg cod and energy consumption per toc removed kwh kg toc evidently there is a huge variety of ef based processes that are utilised for the degradation of multiple organic pollutants resulting in high mineralisation efficiencies hence seven different ef processes are included in this economic evaluation in which these articles are taken from recent three publication years which are 2018 2020 the ef processes are classical ef hef pef spef pc bef and sef in general comparison of energy consumption between ef processes is rather complex due to the variance in many aspects such as type of process type of wastewater or pollutants treated current applied chemicals utilised type of electrode reactor configuration treatment time and many others ef process diversity the first main aspect affecting energy consumption cost is the different type of ef process for example pef process is usually being compared with classical ef process to investigate its worthiness to be implemented in industrial scale referring to study by queiroz et al 2019 in total pef system consume 0 279 kw h g toc which is about half of the energy consumed by ef system 0 468 kw h g toc even though pef system results in much higher toc removal efficiency compared to ef system 87 this could be explained from the competent photolysis of fe iii hydroxy species in pef system which generated large number of oh radicals responsible for pollutant mineralisation hence lowering the system s energy consumption per toc removed however the highly effective pef system does pose a slight weakness towards industrial scale implementation this is due to the high total energy consumption by pef system when the energy from light source is taken into account which is 8 81 kw h g toc however this limitation could be overcome by replacing the lamp light source to sunlight energy as a more inexpensive irradiation source alternative comparing a spef system by ye et al 2019 this system has much less energy consumption which is 4 kw h g toc 88 compared to the pef system as energy requirement for light source is eliminated in this spef system having this advantage spef system is commonly inferred to be the best performing ef based process as the system resulted in remarkable pollutant degradation potential and the exposure to sunlight encouraged almost complete mineralisation at no extra cost so this system is rather attractive for larger scale industrial application reactor design reactor design also affects the energy consumed by a particular ef system two pc systems are compared to address this aspect in which vale júnio et al 2018 researched a batch pc system while ren et al 2019 designed a multi stage flow through system with both systems having pretty close cod removal efficiencies 70 72 5 the energy consumption for flow through system is 0 0021 kw h g cod 50 which is much lower compared to the batch system 0 06 kw h g cod 89 this flow through system is more industrial friendly as it has the advantages of low energy consumption and reasonably efficient pollutant mineralisation potential also with the presence of multi stage design energy consumption of an ef system will be directly influenced by the number of stages required to achieve targeted cod removal efficiency 50 hence treating different type of wastewater of different concentration will require different number of stages for efficient treatment process to take place so the energy consumption and cost will also vary from the afore mentioned factors in addition taking example of spef systems reported by ye et al 2019 and fajardo et al 2019 the system designed as filter press flow cell results in higher energy consumption 4 kw h g toc 88 compared to the batch cell process with 0 12 kw h g cod 90 this finding is in contrast to the earlier finding in which for pc system the flow through reactor resulted in lower energy consumption compared to batch system hence it can be concluded that different reactor design along with different process design do lead to varying energy consumption of the system electrode material next type of electrode employed in an ef system does affect the energy consumption of the system as the electrodes both anode and cathode are responsible for producing the oxidant species responsible for pollutant removal mechanisms assessing two classical ef systems the energy consumption is compared per volume of treated wastewater in which 0 21 kw h m3 is consumed through ef system reported by ren et al 2019 while kaur et al 2019 reported 0 789 kw h m3 of energy consumption 91 92 despite numerous aspects that could be contributing to the difference in energy consumption between these two systems but the most obvious factor that is deemed to highly affect their energy consumption is the type of cathode utilised in the system lower energy consumption is expected with the use of a modified electrode graphite felt modified with electrochemically exfoliated graphene eegr and carbon black by ren et al 2019 in comparison to a basic aluminium electrode by kaur et al 2019 the modified graphite felt is believed to be more efficient in generating h2o2 at lower driving current which then contribute to the formation of oh radicals to be utilised for the degradation process of organic pollutants hence this explains the smaller electrical energy requirement in the system with the modified electrode in addition even with capability of cathode to electrogenerate h2o2 some ef systems are designed with external addition of h2o2 instead of cathode modification in order to reduce the energy consumption for generating h2o2 at the cathode this is a good effort to reduce energy consumption but it will create other costs which is the chemical consumption cost as well as the required transportation and storage cost of h2o2 catalyst material the type of catalyst employed in a system also directly influences the efficiency and energy consumption of the system two hef systems are compared in which each system employed different type of heterogeneous catalysts both systems are able to achieve reasonably high pollutant mineralisation efficiencies with reported energy consumption of 18 24 kw h m3 by hammouda et al 2019 using magnetic double perovskite oxide sr2fecuo6 catalyst and 26 91 kw h m3 reported by rosales et al 2019 using chitosan epichlorohydrin with iron iii oxide catalyst other common heterogeneous catalysts that have been attempted by several researchers in ef system are iron zeolite 93 94 pyrite 95 96 and ferro magnetic iron oxide 97 one of the possible reasons for the fairly big difference in energy consumption between the two mentioned systems is the potency difference in diverse type of heterogeneous catalysts utilised in the respective systems these catalysts influence the optimum treatment ph of the system and subsequently the required driving electrical energy hence resulting in different values of current voltage required to achieve ideal treatment efficacy as observed from the listed examples of hef process the system with lower energy consumption has smaller operational current compared to the system with slightly higher energy consumption pollutants variety in addition type of organic pollutants or wastewaters could highly influence the energy consumed by a particular ef system to achieve a specific pollutant removal efficiency referring to a bef system authored by nadais et al 2018 four different pharmaceutical pollutants are treated by this system with each having different removal efficiency ranging from 60 up to 97 98 the calculated energy consumption for this system is 29 8 kw h m3 of treated solution however depending on the type of pollutant being treated by this system this energy consumption could be either too high or satisfactory for example since the removal of diclofenac is rather high using this system 97 the energy consumption to achieve this removal efficiency is acceptable conversely for ketoprofen its low degradation efficiency 61 indicates that higher energy consumption is required in order to achieve a much better degradation efficiency hence this emphasises the varying energy requirement in ef system depending on the recalcitrance of a specific pollutant additionally to increase the attractiveness of a bef system for larger scale implementation the system could be designed without external power supply thus eliminating the reactor energy consumption however this so called mfc bef has the limitation of limited h2o2 as well as lengthy treatment time which are insufficient and inadequate to treat high concentrations of organic pollutants 16 therefore mec bef system is preferred as it demonstrated high h2o2 at lower energy consumed compared to conventional ef system it is also able to treat high concentrations of pops electrochemical treatment time another aspect that directly affects the energy consumption of an ef process is the treatment time in comparison to classical ef system an advanced ef system such as sef is able to operate in a shorter treatment time to degrade a particular organic pollutant or wastewater due to the presence of sonolysis mechanism this mechanism helps to enhance the mineralisation of organic pollutants to achieve high treatment efficiency example of sef process is taken from an article published by hasani et al 2020 with 97 5 of the antibiotic degraded at energy consumption of 2 kw h m3 throughout 81 5 min treatment time 99 this is a great pollutant mineralisation performance achieved at a relatively short treatment time and reasonable amount of energy utilised however in terms of larger scale application this sef system may not be very feasible compared to classical ef system due to the requirement of extra sonication equipment and possible higher energy consumption including energy from sonication equipment variation in electrolyte the choice of appropriate electrolyte is important as it has a significant impact on the efficiency of an ef process through the provision of proper electric current passage the application of a particular electrolyte to an ef system will affect the faradic yield cell voltage and energy consumption in the respective ef reactor 100 in general sodium sulphate na2so4 is known to be the commonly used electrolyte for conductivity enhancement of solutions as per articles in table 5 taking into example articles published by zazou et al 2019 and do vale júnior et al 2018 both compared the efficiency of two types of electrolyte nacl and na2so4 in which ef processes with na2so4 electrolyte are found to be significantly more efficient 89 101 vale júnior et al 2018 reported about 88 colour removal achieved for nacl system and 96 for na2so4 system however in contrast to ef process reported by daneshvar et al 2008 nacl electrolyte in ef system results in better ef reaction rate compared to na2so4 102 in general it is widely noted that presence of cl and s o 4 2 in both chloride and sulphate mediums could lead to the scavenging effect on oh radicals through formation of some species such as organochlorinated products chlorate and perchlorate and sulphate radical 89 hence concentration of electrolyte as well as current applied to ef system are important parameters to control the occurrence rate of oh radicals scavenging reactions energy consumed by an ef system could be optimised through smart decision on electrolyte type and its concentration all in all it can be stated that the correlation between electrolyte and ef efficiency is not always apparent 103 in conclusion it is clear that for some ef based processes the complexity of system configuration and energy costs are the biggest challenge for the large scale industrial application hence optimisation strategies are important to be employed in the design of large scale ef reactors to minimise the aforementioned costs the main cost limiting operational and design components in this ef technology which are deemed to require strategic optimisation are the reactor design current voltage catalysts treatment time operational ph and electrode characteristics these elements are very dependent on each other in which proper design of these elements will lead to highly successful treatment system as well as economically feasible system all in all the systematic refinement of ef s total operational cost will subsequently have influence on compensation of ef s high investment cost which makes it worth to be implemented in large scale 4 current research perspective and future prospects throughout the last two decades the number of publications on ef has grown tremendously with the recent decade 2010 2019 recording significantly higher ef publication growth this shows that ef technology has started to become an important alternative in treating persistent organic pollutants in water bodies with increasing number of ef publications per year it is expected to grow more with wider research areas to be discovered and also mature the current research aspects it is noteworthy that some ef processes like hef and pef have received rather wide attention from researchers worldwide while other processes like pc bef sef could be further developed for wider applications to further improve the potential of various ef processes the following are the important aspects that require further research focus which are expected to mature over time synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts using novel materials for improved ef process heterogeneous catalyst is combined with ef process to form a so called hef process which it is deemed to promote a more versatile ef process having wide operational ph range less sludge formation and heterogeneous catalysts recyclability these heterogeneous catalysts are insoluble and usually comprise iron species to allow fenton reaction to take place they could also contribute to catalysing of h2o2 in ef process as well as acting as the cathode recently more researchers have been attempting to develop highly efficient iron containing synthetic heterogeneous catalysts through the use of various novel resources on its own or supported on microporous and mesoporous materials however persistent problems continue to arise such as agglomeration of non supported magnetic nanoparticles catalysts falling off from supports and abundant catalyst leaching into treated effluents especially those that are toxic even at small concentrations 5 7 112 hence studies on production of catalysts of high stability high catalytic activity and low environmental toxicity are necessary to ensure further advance of this heterogeneous ef process also in terms of economic feasibility low cost catalyst preparation is vital to pave the direction for this hef process into penetrating industrial application so economical and environmentally feasible catalyst synthesis method has been one of the current challenges which require more focus from researchers in this water reclamation field fabrication of electrode for enhanced efficiency and robustness electrodes both anode and cathode play a huge role in determining the efficiency of an ef based process especially for large scale application of ef system electrode material efficiency and life span are the most important aspects that will greatly affect the cost of wastewater treatment generally for cathode porous carbon based electrode and 3 dimensional electrode system is preferred to allow the adsorption of oxygen on the electrode surface for oxygen reduction to h2o2 to take place a number of novel carbon ptfe gde and modified carbon electrodes have been synthesised by several researchers through usage of various carbon and nanocarbon materials along with catalysts impregnation 84 88 113 114 examples of catalyst materials that have been studied are transition metals and allotrope of carbon such as graphene besides cathode for some ef processes anodes are usually made of chemically inert electrodes such as metals or metal oxides in many researches bdd is found to have superior capability as anode material compared to other materials but its high cost is the major drawback for industrial application in fact other precious metal anodes like platinum and silver do not seem appropriate for large scale application so extensive study on electrode materials is crucial in order to produce a highly efficient electrode having high robustness high catalytic activity long life span and high electrode poisoning resistance in addition with respect to carbon based cathode modification materials selection is important for catalyst synthesis on cathode as catalysts are required to show high activity towards 2e orr at low applied potential as for economic point of view optimisation of electrode and catalyst costing could be initiated through innovative fabrication methods as well as large scale production to minimise the preparation cost design of integrated wastewater treatment system comprising ef process with other technology for implementation in various wastewater applications the operating principles of an ef process have made it rather challenging to be implemented as a single unit for any wastewater treatment system in order to exploit its full potential ef process can be coupled with other technology to form an integrated wastewater treatment system past studies have attempted several integrated systems such as ef based processes combined with other electrochemical processes i e electrocoagulation electro oxidation 115 116 ef processes as pre treatment to biological processes 117 118 combination of ef with aops 119 and also ef processes coupled to membrane filtration process 120 from the results of the previous studies the overall performance of these integrated systems has been excellent with the possibility of having lower total operational cost especially energy consumption cost compared to a treatment system with ef process as a sole unit hence having a highly efficient and optimised integrated wastewater treatment system will boost its economic viability for industrial application having two and more technologies coupled to form a system will benefit the ability of the system to degrade wider range of pollutants thus creating a feasible systematic system the study on optimisation of integrated system design could be further explored as it shows promising research path for researchers in ef field scaling up bench lab scale process to pilot plant level suitable for in field application although more in depth studies are still required to further refine this process the ef technology has demonstrated its fair feasibility and readiness to be scaled up to pilot plant level for industrial implementation however not many studies on ef pilot plant have been carried out as most researchers are still focusing on lab scale investigation scaling up ef process has been a major challenge for researchers in this field due to the high risk of the process not operating efficiently at high effluent volume and large electrode dimension however researchers should be enthusiastic in facing this challenge in order to prove the competency of this process in degrading pops in wastewaters at much bigger scale compared to conventional wastewater treatment system scaling up this ef process is an important step before reaching industrial scale application during scale up stage feasibility study has to be executed in terms of operation in continuous mode and treatment of highly polluted wastewater in large volume this is because the findings from most researches carried out in batch lab scale are limited to small volume of wastewater or low concentration synthetic pollutant which do not represent the real circumstances also design of reactor is crucial in making sure a scaled up ef process could be operated efficiently to manage large vigorous wastewater load additionally information on energy consumption for pilot scale configuration is also lacking due to the deficiency in pilot scale study which is why it is crucial research focus analysis of economic cost that is not just limited to energy consumption cost it is well known that economic cost is the restrictive factor for large scale expansion of ef processes in order to overcome this restriction ef process should able to be cost competitive in comparison to current conventional wastewater treatment technology economic cost could be estimated in terms of operational cost and investment for each type of ef process having different optimum operational parameters and reactor design the total cost of the system could vary widely referring to the ef publication data presented in this paper the analysis on economic aspect of ef processes is very limited as it is often left aside in most publications the researchers only considered energy consumption element which is limited to reactor cell as part of their economic analysis discussion while a small number of researchers do also include rough estimation of chemicals and electrode consumption nevertheless this information alone is insufficient to explicitly address the economic feasibility of a system hence in future study detailed information on economic cost of an ef system should be considered in publications taking into account important costing like chemical energy electrode and reactor investment costs life cycle assessment lca of ef process for environmental impacts study it is recommended for the lca to be applied to this ef system in order to evaluate the environmental profile of the system this is an important study especially before ef system is scaled up to avoid any undesirable consequences from the advancement of the system although eaops are known to have immense ability in degrading wide variety of toxic organic pollutants it is important to conduct toxicity assessment on effluents of this ef process to minimise the release of any highly toxic by products depending on type of pollutant or wastewater being treated the various constituents in the solution will lead to the formation of various toxicity levels by products so it is important to evaluate the toxicity of by products formed from this ef treatment so that necessary recovery actions could be taken besides that ef processes will usually produce sludge and it would be rather interesting to include the study on sludge recyclability instead of disposing it sludge produced from the ef processes could be transformed into other usable products such as catalyst so having more focus on the comprehensive study of lca as well as by products toxicity assessments and sludge management will further promote the attractiveness of ef process to be implemented widely in industries 5 concluding remarks ef is undeniably an efficient method for the degradation of persistent organic contaminants in various types of wastewaters its excellent performance has attracted numerous researchers and industrial players to invest in researching about this ef system referring to bibliometric analysis the growth progress of ef processes has been really exciting especially throughout the second decade 2010 2019 this field showed exponential growth in publication with cumulative number of published papers throughout second decade 2010 2019 is about 6 times larger than in first decade 2000 2009 it could be predicted that the number of ef publication in 2020 will continue to grow passing the total publication number in 2019 this large growth is contributed by researchers from about 58 countries with 4 largest contributors which are china spain france and iran both spain and france benefit greatly from their high collaboration network ef research areas have expanded widely during second decade having large variety on study areas such as electrode and catalyst synthesis technology integration process comparison mathematical modelling and ef applications focusing on degradation pathway and toxicity evaluation parameter study electrode comparison and system design also these areas of study are further supported by the keywords analysis showing clear correlation between keywords that related to a particular study area all in all the positive development in nature of study indicates the progressive growth of ef technology as efficient and environmentally feasible water treatment system for toxic pops abatement as for journal analysis most of the highly cited publications are published by journals belong in the top 10 productive journals for ef publication having reasonably high impact factors in addition this escalating ef research growth does not guarantee its viability for bigger scale industrial applications hence economic analysis especially on comparison of energy consumption has been carried out to provide sufficient understanding on the factors affecting energy consumption of an ef system i e reactor design type of ef process operational parameters future works should continue to focus on the afore mentioned areas of study as well as focusing on scaling up the ef processes through scrutinisation of their

13647,flue gas desulfurization system is widely used to remove the sox in the refineries however this produces a large amount of desulfurization wastewater which is difficult to treat under strict environmental laws therefore the near zero liquid discharge near zld of desulfurization wastewater is an imperative requirement in the petrochemical industry this study serves as one of the pioneering attempts to explore the near zld of desulfurization wastewater via hybrid electrodialysis ed reverse osmosis ro system a lab scale plant was established to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system and optimize the operating parameters through this system the wastewater was concentrated from about 78 g l to over 230 g l while the conductivity of product water can reach 550 μs cm or less the concentrated stream was then frozen to reclaim high purity sodium sulfate crystals the product water can be directly discharged into water bodies or reused as industrial circulating water without any further treatment this study proves the hybrid ed ro system is an efficient near zld approach for desulfurization wastewater treatment which facilitates the production of freshwater and the reclaim of salt resources keywords desulfurization wastewater electro dialysis reversal osmosis near zero liquid discharge modelling 1 introduction with the rising demand for energy the consumption of fossil fuels has been saturated during petroleum refining and combustion of fossil fuels the emitted exhaust flue gas always contains a considerable quantity of sox which is the main cause of air pollution urban smog and acid rain 1 sox also makes a great impact on environmental protection under the pressure of strict environmental laws all refineries are equipped with a flue gas desulfurization system to remove sox from flue gas though the problem of sox emission is solved a large amount of desulfurization wastewater is still produced during this process desulfurization wastewater is fluctuated in characteristics unstable and corrosive it is acidic water with a ph of 5 6 it contains considerable chloride ions cl 5 20 g l suspended content 10 60 g l heavy metal contaminations like ca2 and mg2 20 50 g l and therefore high hardness and tremendous cod due to its high salinity the desulfurization wastewater is harmful to the ecosystem so it is not allowed to be recycled or discharged directly in the past few years the near zero liquid discharge near zld of desulfurization wastewater has been required by the environmental protection department epd in china however few studies have focused on the near zld of desulfurization wastewater therefore we urgently need to study the near zld of desulfurization wastewater to reduce environmental pressure conventionally there are two methods for treating desulfurization wastewater chemical precipitation is the most widely used technique thus far 2 during the process a large number of alkaline reagents and organic sulfur reagents are used to remove the heavy metal ions to achieve higher levels of water quality nevertheless this method cannot meet the requirement of near zld because a large quantity of sulfate and chloride in the wastewater cannot be removed effectively the other often used approach for desulfurization wastewater treatment is direct evaporation or evaporation using the waste heat of flue gas 3 in this process dissolved salts will be removed from the wastewater delete in light of the above considerations there is an urgent need to explore a new cost effective way method to achieve near zld of desulfurization wastewater the problem of near zld is how to separate total dissolved salts and high quality product water from high salinity wastewater with low energy consumption electrodialysis ed has advantages of higher water recovery rate and lower energy consumption 4 6 and is considered as a feasible way to treat high salinity wastewater a study 7 showed that salinity water could be concentrated from about 20 g l to 200 g l through the experimental ed plant and the average energy consumption was about 10 kw h m3 which was much lower than the evaporation method about 25 kw h m3 however ed technology has problems in recovering high quality product water 8 9 it is worth noting that when the high salinity wastewater is desalinated to a low salt concentration e g less than 10 15 g l the efficiency of the ed process will be quite low 10 this is because the big concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane accelerates the backward diffusion of ions and the migration of water in addition the cost of the ed device is prohibitively high at low salt concentration because of the relatively low limiting current density which requires a large membrane area or a long residence time 11 12 it seems that while using ed concentrating salt and recovering high quality water cannot be achieved at the same time reversal osmosis ro which is widely applied for producing freshwater from salty water in industry provides an efficient solution to improve the quality of product water several researchers 13 16 employed a hybrid ed ro system to treat high salinity wastewater which helps to minimize the volume of wastewater and improve the quality of product water loganathan et al 17 treated basal aquifer water by using a hybrid ed ro system in which the water recovery rate achieved 77 oren et al 18 established a ro ed combined system to treat brackish groundwater in which the overall water recovery rate achieved 98 and chloride levels of product water achieved 200 mg l or less this study is one of the pioneering attempts to explore the near zld of desulfurization wastewater in this study a hybrid ed ro system was designed for the near zld of desulfurization wastewater firstly the feasibility of the hybrid ed ro system was tested with na2so4 solution as feed the objective of the first step also relies on the analysis of the mass transfer process then an ed model was employed for the ed process analysis and operation parameter optimization as the key part of this study the actual desulfurization wastewater with after sample pre treatment was then successfully treated via the hybrid ed ro system under the optimized operating conditions accordingly this study helps to develop a more effective method for the near zld of desulfurization wastewater and the reclaim of salt resources 2 experimental 2 1 equipment the membrane stack used in the ed unit consists of nineteen pairs assembled by twenty cation exchange membranes and nineteen anion exchange membranes these membranes were cmx amx homogeneous ion exchange membranes products of the astom co ltd japan the size of the rubber spacers in the stack was 400 mm length 200 mm width 0 7 mm thickness and a polypropylene mesh was embedded between the rubber spacers to accelerate turbulence also in the ed unit there is a variable power source 0 40 v 0 20 a a pair of electrodes made of titanium plated ruthenium three plastic centrifugal pumps cq25 15 125 wenzhou erle pump co ltd china and several flow meters lzs 25c yuyao industrial automation instrument factory china the membrane used in the ro unit was a high pressure reverse osmosis membrane the ro membrane is the commercial membrane sw30hr dows with an effective area of 78 5 cm2 the operation pressure in the ro unit is set as 4 83 mpa i e 700 psi using a concentrate recycling mode the manufacturer reports the salt rejection exceeds 99 with a nacl solution of 32 800 mg l as feed and a pressure of 5 52 mpa a high pressure hydra cell pump product of wanner engineering inc us was also employed as the ro feed pump 2 2 feed solution and wastewater quality the feed solution used for the test was na2so4 solution it was prepared by na2so4 sinopharm china and ultrapure di water milli q system merck millipore germany the desulfurization wastewater samples were collected from huabei oilfield located in hebei province china the characteristics of the wastewater were analyzed and summarized in table 1 tds conductivity and ph of the feed wastewater were monitored using conductivity and ph meters respectively so4 2 and cl ions were performed with an ion chromatography the concentrations of na ba2 si2 sr2 mg2 ca2 are measured using an ion adsorption chromatography aas varian 10 plus model nh4 n total nitrogen tn tds ss are tested according to method hj537 2009 hj636 2012 hj t51 1999 gb11901 89 respectively 2 3 experimental procedures the wastewater quality analysis showed that a substantial suspended solid ss remained in this effluent in order to ensure a long operating cycle of the subsequent treatment system a ceramic membrane filtration was employed as a pretreatment method to remove ss in wastewater based on the relevant results of filtration tests the tubular ceramic membrane 50 nm pore size henan fangzhou ceramics co ltd china was selected during the experiment then the hybrid ed ro system was proposed to treat the effluent firstly the effluent was concentrated by the ed unit the concentrated stream can be crystallized at low temperatures around 0 c and the dilute stream was pumped into the ro unit for deep desalination and re concentration the ro product water could be reused directly and the ro concentrate mixed with the effluent pretreated by the ceramic membrane was pumped into the ed unit as the feed solution a simplified schematic diagram of the treatment system is shown in fig 1 it was worth noting that the design of this combined process avoids the problems resulting from the low concentration of the dilute stream and the relatively large concentration difference in the ed stack though the same effect can be achieved by using a two stage ed process ro is better than the second stage ed because of its stable product water quality and low energy consumption when the feed solution is at low concentration therein the ed unit chose the batch operation mode and the ed stack adopted the constant current mode the applied current density was determined according to the current voltage relation under the setting operating conditions such as the feed concentration and linear flow velocity a linear flow velocity of 3 7 cm s was adopted in this unit to guarantee the turbulence extent and avoid high pressure in the stack while treating the actual desulfurization wastewater the initial volume ratio of the concentrated stream to the dilute stream was calculated accordingly besides a pressure of 4 83 mpa was adopted in the ro unit 2 4 analysis the concentrations of different streams were determined according to the conductivity of each solution which was measured by a portable conductivity meter cond 3210 wtw germany the relation correlation between conductivity and concentration were shown in table 2 and were calibrated to 25 c and regressed in three different ranges the volume changes of the dilute stream and the concentrated stream in the ed unit were represented by the scales on the two stream tanks a precision of 0 05 l the product water was weighed by an electronic balance ab204 s mettler toledo switzerland besides ss was determined by gravimetric method gb11901 89 3 modelling of the ed process in order to reduce the number of experiments for process optimization a mathematical model was established in this study to simulate the ed process during the ed process the transport of ions and solutions forms the essential mass transport process ions actually hydrated ions are transferred from desalting compartment to concentrating compartment under the force of the electric field at the same time the osmotic pressure difference between desalting and concentrating compartments forces solution usually water to transport across the ion exchange membranes under the pseudo steady state conditions the mass balance of ions and water in the dilute stream d and concentrated stream c for the ed system can be described as follows 19 21 1 j s d n s d d t d n s c d t t b f a m e i n c e l l l b a m g δ c n c e l l 2 j w d n w d d t d n w c d t t w f a m e i n c

and ρ represents γ m w μ m s ρ d eqs 5 8 can be numerically solved once the initial conditions cd t 0 cc t 0 vd t 0 vc t 0 are set 4 results and discussions 4 1 the determination of applied current in this study constant current mode was employed in the ed unit generally the limit current can be determined by analyzing the current voltage curves the applied current of the ed stack can be determined as follows the desulfurization wastewater was desalted to 10 g l in the ed unit whereas the concentrated stream was concentrated to 200 g l or more according to fig s1 the applied current was determined as 12 5 a i 30 ma cm2 based on the above analysis of the limit current determined at 10 g l and a safety factor of 0 8 22 4 2 the mass transfer processes during ed fluxes of ions js and volume change rate jv describe the mass transfer process during the ed which can be determined by a series of experiments fig 2 shows the correlation between js and concentration difference under different current densities the linear treading lines of threes data sets suggest that js decreases slightly with the increase of the concentration differences under different current densities the transport of ions can be divided into two parts the migration caused by applied current and the backward diffusion caused by a concentration difference taking a close look the contribution rate of backward diffusion to the entire ion transport is about 8 2 when the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 this indicates that the influence of backward diffusion on ion transport is very limited fig 3 illustrates the variation of jv in function of the concentration difference under different current densities the absolute value of jv increases with the increase of the concentration difference under different current densities according to linear regression the coefficients in the equation at 30 ma cm2 is φ 5 93 l c and ρ 5 20 10 11 m4 mol s which is in good agreement consistent with the experimental result analyzed by wang et al 23 based on the above results and analysis these equations are in good agreement with the experimental phenomena and can be used to describe the ed process in this study when the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 parameters of the model are determined as follows λ 3 63 10 3 mol c μ 5 20 10 8 m s φ 5 93 l c and ρ 5 20 10 11 m4 mol s 4 3 the concentration degree and water recovery rate actually two figures in ed unit have attracted much attention that is the final concentration of the concentrated stream and the water recovery rate the high final concentration of the concentrated stream contributes to recovery of sodium sulfate the water recovery rate r can be calculated by eq 9 9 r v d v c v d in which v d is the volume of the dilute stream at the end vc and vd are the volumes of the dilute and concentrated stream at the beginning respectively as one of the important operation parameters the initial volume ratio of the dilute stream to the concentrated stream affects both the final concentration and water recovery rate at the same time using the ed model and the parameters determined by experiences the ed process under different initial volume ratios can be described easily fig 4 shows the changes of the final concentration and the water recovery rate respectively at different initial volume ratios the final concentration of the dilute stream is set as 10 g l the final concentration of the concentrated steam is always increasing with the increase of the initial volume ratio when the initial volume ratio exceeds 9 the final concentration of the concentrated steam is about 240 g l and then rises slowly and remains a high level the water recovery rate follows the same trend which remains nearly unchanged when the initial volume ratio is greater than 9 if the applicable range of this model is not taken into consideration even the initial volume ratio is increased from 9 to 50 the final concentration of the concentrated steam will also increase from 236 g l to 276 g l and the water recovery rate will increase from 70 to 75 since the solubility of na2so4 at 0 c is about 4 9 g 100 ml h2o nearly 50 g l further improvement of the final concentration will not significantly enhance the amount of the salt recovered however the great increase of initial volume ratio will lead to higher operation costs while the water recovery will increase slightly the reason is that for a certain amount of wastewater a higher initial volume ratio means more wastewater needs to be treated and more energy will be consumed therefore the initial volume ratio is set to 9 in order to achieve a relatively high final concentration and water recovery rate with all above factors considered in fact the water transport from the dilute stream to the concentrated stream is the main factor preventing the realization of high final concentration 23 and high water recovery rate the water transport can be divided into two parts the electro osmosis and the osmosis the electro osmosis is caused by ion transport which is inevitable in this study the mole ratio of electro osmosis water to the sodium sulphate is about 6 3 which is not consistent with the theoretical value na 3 5 24 so4 2 2 8 25 total 9 8 lu et al 26 also observed similar experimental phenomena which is caused by steric hindrance osmosis in the form of free water molecules is caused by osmotic pressure difference the quantity of water is related to the preparation method of the ion exchange membrane with the increase of concentration difference between the two compartments the osmosis effect is aggravated the slow increase of water recovery rate under high initial volume ratio was shown in fig 5 4 4 the treatment of desulfurization wastewater to investigate the feasibility of the hybrid ed ro system for treating desulfurization wastewater and test its potential industrial application the working performance of ed and ro has been studied in this work the actual desulfurization wastewater without pre treatment was collected from huabei oilfield hebei province china as mentioned above ceramic membrane filtration is employed to remove suspended solids because the ss contented in this effluent can pollute foul the membrane rapidly the ss content in this effluent decreased from 1760 mg l to 2 mg l after pre treatment which meets the requirement of the feed water in the ed unit based on experience and analysis the optimal operation conditions of the ed unit are as follows the linear flow velocity is 3 7 cm s the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 and the initial volume ratio of the dilute stream to the concentrated stream is 9 with the total volume of 25 l the changes of theoretical calculation values and experimental results with time to the concentration of the concentrated stream are shown in fig 5 as it can be seen the experimental results are very close to the theoretical calculation values during the first time period the concentration of the concentrated stream increased almost linearly then the growth of concentration diminishes remarkably and the final concentration is reached over time obviously the rapid increasing of water transport prevents from the achievement of a higher concentration due to the increase of concentration difference after 190 min of operation the desulfurization wastewater was concentrated to 230 g l and the water recovery rate was 70 0 which is consistent with the calculation results ie 230 0 g l and 69 2 furthermore the actual concentration is always slightly lower than the theoretical calculation value during the actual wastewater treatment the deviation is mainly caused by the small quantity low content of nacl in the wastewater another reason is the calculation value of concentration difference between different compartments is slightly lower than the actual situation inside the ed stack during the process after the treatment of the ed unit the desulfurization wastewater is desalted to 10 g l which requires deep desalination before it can be reused considering the efficiency and the investment the ro unit was employed for the deep desalination of the dilute stream in this study a domestic high pressure reverse osmosis membrane was used the operation conditions are as follows the applied pressure is 4 83 mpa and the effective membrane area is 78 5 cm2 the ro unit is operated in batch mode by using the dilute stream as the feed solution which was produced by the ed unit that is to say ro concentrated solution is recirculated to the feed side until the concentration of ro concentrated solution reached the requirement a relatively high pressure is adopted in order to achieve a high concentration in the feed side and the final ro concentrated solution can be returned to the ed unit the performance of the ro membrane was found to be consistent with a 99 6 salt rejection desalination rate under 4 83 mpa and a stable permeate water flux of about 45 l m2h fig 6 presents the performance of the ro unit for deep desalination of the dilute stream during the operation overall the salt rejection rate is relatively stable with a slight decrease as the solution concentration on the feed side of ro increases during the operation as a result of the batch mode adopted a remarkable decrease of the permeate flux was observed during the operation which was mainly caused by the increase of the concentration on the feed side however there was no significant impact on the ro unit because the permeate flux always exceeds 45 l m2h which is a high level in practical applications during the operation the conductivity of the product water which is demonstrated in fig s2 is always below 550 μs cm the product water can be directly charged into water bodies or reused as industrial circulating water without further treatment based on the national standards of prc gb 8978 1996 and gb 50050 1995 the dilute stream of the ed unit is re concentrated to 72 g l efficiently by the ro unit mixed with the ed feed solutions and treated again by the ed unit after being treated by the hybrid ed ro system the actual desulfurization wastewater is concentrated to 230 g l and then the concentrated stream is crystallized at a low temperature around 0 c the sodium sulphate crystals and the product water with relatively low conductivity in this work are demonstrated in fig 7 to test the purity of sodium sulphate crystals x ray diffraction analysis was carried out and the results are shown in fig s4 from the standard xrd spectrogram and experimental xrd spectrogram of na2so4 the recovered na2so4 has the same diffraction peak as the standard data indicating the high purity of the na2so4 sample based on the original analysis of desulfurization wastewater the undesirable diffraction peaks of recyclable na2so4 can be well indexed as a complex structure of insoluble sludge cl ca2 and mg2 in the wastewater based on the weighing method and ion chromatography the quantitative analysis of impurities is shown in table 3 according the national standard of prc gb t 6009 2014 anhydrous sodium sulfate for industrial use these results reveal that the recovered na2so4 from desulfurization wastewater can reach level i in first class standards 4 5 the current efficiency and energy consumption it is impossible that applied current can be used completely for desalination or concentration in the ed stack the current efficiency η which refers to the proportion of the current used for ion transport in the total current applied in membrane stack can be calculated by the following equation 5 η z f δ m n i d t in which z is the charge of ion f is the faraday constant δm is the change in salt content mol during this period t s n is the number of cell pairs of the membrane stack and i is the applied current a the current efficiency can be used to investigate the unexpected phenomena during ed operation such as backward diffusion of ions shunt current and co ions transport it is also a significant reference value for further optimization of optional parameters and stack design the dependence of the current efficiency on the concentration difference at a current density of 30 ma cm2 in this study is demonstrated in fig s3 it can be seen that the current efficiency tends to slightly decrease with the increase of the concentration difference obviously the backward diffusion caused by concentration gradient across the membranes is the main reason the measured current efficiency is between 78 and 91 during the whole process which indicates that ed is an energy efficient process in addition the energy consumption at 30 ma cm2 is demonstrated in fig 8 for convenience ease of analysis the energy consumption is calculated by eq 6 which is expressed as the energy consumed per kilogram sodium sulphate for transferring across the membranes without the loss of electrode and does not consider the energy consumption of the pump either 6 e k w h k g n a 2 s o 4 i u d t m δ m in which i is the applied current u is the mean voltage of the membrane stack δm is the change of the salt content mol in the desalting compartments during the time interval t and m is the molar mass of na2so4 142 g mol the average energy consumption of the membrane stack applied current density is 30 ma cm2 is 0 20 0 25 kw h kg na2so4 which is slightly higher than that of nacl solution 18 that is because the affinity of so4 2 to h2o the gibbs free energy is 1000 kj mol is much stronger than that of cl to h2o the gibbs free energy is 317 kj mol 27 it is worth noting that the changes of concentration difference between desalting compartments and concentrating compartments will not cause significant changes of energy consumption when the concentration of the dilute stream is above 10 g l the energy consumption is essentially unchanged which is about 0 21 kw h kg na2so4 when the concentration of the dilute stream is below 10 g l the energy consumption tends to increase rapidly higher than 0 25 kw h kg na2so4 with the decrease of concentration this phenomenon indicates the appearance of the concentration polarization and serious performance degradation of the membrane stack which is in good agreement with the analysis based on limiting current in addition although the actual desulfurization wastewater without softening process was successfully treated by ed and ro combined process chemical precipitation or resin adsorption process may improve the quality of wastewater which may be more suitable for membrane process however it may not be necessary to use chemical precipitation or resin adsorption process before treatment because the concentration of heavy metals in the desulfurization wastewater is relatively low 5 conclusions this research evaluates the efficiency of the hybrid ed ro system to achieve the near zld of desulfurization wastewater the system is also equipped with a low temperature crystallizer to recover and reuse the salts the results indicate pretreatment through ceramic membrane filtration is reliable for removing suspended solids in the ed unit the water transport between compartments is the main factor preventing higher concentration time though the ed model an appropriate initial volume ratio can effectively balance the final concentration and load of the ed unit the wastewater has been successfully concentrated to 230 g l when the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 and the initial volume ratio is 9 in the ro unit the dilute stream of the ed unit can be concentrated again from 10 g l to 70 g l under the pressure of 4 83 mpa of the product water the permeate flux is at a high level and the quality of the product water is good enough to be directly loaded into water bodies or reused as industrial circulating water without further treatment as an important factor during membrane operation membrane fouling and scaling are not found in this study overall this laboratory scale study demonstrates that the hybrid ed ro system is an efficient near zld method for treating the desulfurization wastewater to recover and reuse the water and salt as resources looking forward it is promising to apply this technology in the practical wastewater treatment plant declaration of

13647,flue gas desulfurization system is widely used to remove the sox in the refineries however this produces a large amount of desulfurization wastewater which is difficult to treat under strict environmental laws therefore the near zero liquid discharge near zld of desulfurization wastewater is an imperative requirement in the petrochemical industry this study serves as one of the pioneering attempts to explore the near zld of desulfurization wastewater via hybrid electrodialysis ed reverse osmosis ro system a lab scale plant was established to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system and optimize the operating parameters through this system the wastewater was concentrated from about 78 g l to over 230 g l while the conductivity of product water can reach 550 μs cm or less the concentrated stream was then frozen to reclaim high purity sodium sulfate crystals the product water can be directly discharged into water bodies or reused as industrial circulating water without any further treatment this study proves the hybrid ed ro system is an efficient near zld approach for desulfurization wastewater treatment which facilitates the production of freshwater and the reclaim of salt resources keywords desulfurization wastewater electro dialysis reversal osmosis near zero liquid discharge modelling 1 introduction with the rising demand for energy the consumption of fossil fuels has been saturated during petroleum refining and combustion of fossil fuels the emitted exhaust flue gas always contains a considerable quantity of sox which is the main cause of air pollution urban smog and acid rain 1 sox also makes a great impact on environmental protection under the pressure of strict environmental laws all refineries are equipped with a flue gas desulfurization system to remove sox from flue gas though the problem of sox emission is solved a large amount of desulfurization wastewater is still produced during this process desulfurization wastewater is fluctuated in characteristics unstable and corrosive it is acidic water with a ph of 5 6 it contains considerable chloride ions cl 5 20 g l suspended content 10 60 g l heavy metal contaminations like ca2 and mg2 20 50 g l and therefore high hardness and tremendous cod due to its high salinity the desulfurization wastewater is harmful to the ecosystem so it is not allowed to be recycled or discharged directly in the past few years the near zero liquid discharge near zld of desulfurization wastewater has been required by the environmental protection department epd in china however few studies have focused on the near zld of desulfurization wastewater therefore we urgently need to study the near zld of desulfurization wastewater to reduce environmental pressure conventionally there are two methods for treating desulfurization wastewater chemical precipitation is the most widely used technique thus far 2 during the process a large number of alkaline reagents and organic sulfur reagents are used to remove the heavy metal ions to achieve higher levels of water quality nevertheless this method cannot meet the requirement of near zld because a large quantity of sulfate and chloride in the wastewater cannot be removed effectively the other often used approach for desulfurization wastewater treatment is direct evaporation or evaporation using the waste heat of flue gas 3 in this process dissolved salts will be removed from the wastewater delete in light of the above considerations there is an urgent need to explore a new cost effective way method to achieve near zld of desulfurization wastewater the problem of near zld is how to separate total dissolved salts and high quality product water from high salinity wastewater with low energy consumption electrodialysis ed has advantages of higher water recovery rate and lower energy consumption 4 6 and is considered as a feasible way to treat high salinity wastewater a study 7 showed that salinity water could be concentrated from about 20 g l to 200 g l through the experimental ed plant and the average energy consumption was about 10 kw h m3 which was much lower than the evaporation method about 25 kw h m3 however ed technology has problems in recovering high quality product water 8 9 it is worth noting that when the high salinity wastewater is desalinated to a low salt concentration e g less than 10 15 g l the efficiency of the ed process will be quite low 10 this is because the big concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane accelerates the backward diffusion of ions and the migration of water in addition the cost of the ed device is prohibitively high at low salt concentration because of the relatively low limiting current density which requires a large membrane area or a long residence time 11 12 it seems that while using ed concentrating salt and recovering high quality water cannot be achieved at the same time reversal osmosis ro which is widely applied for producing freshwater from salty water in industry provides an efficient solution to improve the quality of product water several researchers 13 16 employed a hybrid ed ro system to treat high salinity wastewater which helps to minimize the volume of wastewater and improve the quality of product water loganathan et al 17 treated basal aquifer water by using a hybrid ed ro system in which the water recovery rate achieved 77 oren et al 18 established a ro ed combined system to treat brackish groundwater in which the overall water recovery rate achieved 98 and chloride levels of product water achieved 200 mg l or less this study is one of the pioneering attempts to explore the near zld of desulfurization wastewater in this study a hybrid ed ro system was designed for the near zld of desulfurization wastewater firstly the feasibility of the hybrid ed ro system was tested with na2so4 solution as feed the objective of the first step also relies on the analysis of the mass transfer process then an ed model was employed for the ed process analysis and operation parameter optimization as the key part of this study the actual desulfurization wastewater with after sample pre treatment was then successfully treated via the hybrid ed ro system under the optimized operating conditions accordingly this study helps to develop a more effective method for the near zld of desulfurization wastewater and the reclaim of salt resources 2 experimental 2 1 equipment the membrane stack used in the ed unit consists of nineteen pairs assembled by twenty cation exchange membranes and nineteen anion exchange membranes these membranes were cmx amx homogeneous ion exchange membranes products of the astom co ltd japan the size of the rubber spacers in the stack was 400 mm length 200 mm width 0 7 mm thickness and a polypropylene mesh was embedded between the rubber spacers to accelerate turbulence also in the ed unit there is a variable power source 0 40 v 0 20 a a pair of electrodes made of titanium plated ruthenium three plastic centrifugal pumps cq25 15 125 wenzhou erle pump co ltd china and several flow meters lzs 25c yuyao industrial automation instrument factory china the membrane used in the ro unit was a high pressure reverse osmosis membrane the ro membrane is the commercial membrane sw30hr dows with an effective area of 78 5 cm2 the operation pressure in the ro unit is set as 4 83 mpa i e 700 psi using a concentrate recycling mode the manufacturer reports the salt rejection exceeds 99 with a nacl solution of 32 800 mg l as feed and a pressure of 5 52 mpa a high pressure hydra cell pump product of wanner engineering inc us was also employed as the ro feed pump 2 2 feed solution and wastewater quality the feed solution used for the test was na2so4 solution it was prepared by na2so4 sinopharm china and ultrapure di water milli q system merck millipore germany the desulfurization wastewater samples were collected from huabei oilfield located in hebei province china the characteristics of the wastewater were analyzed and summarized in table 1 tds conductivity and ph of the feed wastewater were monitored using conductivity and ph meters respectively so4 2 and cl ions were performed with an ion chromatography the concentrations of na ba2 si2 sr2 mg2 ca2 are measured using an ion adsorption chromatography aas varian 10 plus model nh4 n total nitrogen tn tds ss are tested according to method hj537 2009 hj636 2012 hj t51 1999 gb11901 89 respectively 2 3 experimental procedures the wastewater quality analysis showed that a substantial suspended solid ss remained in this effluent in order to ensure a long operating cycle of the subsequent treatment system a ceramic membrane filtration was employed as a pretreatment method to remove ss in wastewater based on the relevant results of filtration tests the tubular ceramic membrane 50 nm pore size henan fangzhou ceramics co ltd china was selected during the experiment then the hybrid ed ro system was proposed to treat the effluent firstly the effluent was concentrated by the ed unit the concentrated stream can be crystallized at low temperatures around 0 c and the dilute stream was pumped into the ro unit for deep desalination and re concentration the ro product water could be reused directly and the ro concentrate mixed with the effluent pretreated by the ceramic membrane was pumped into the ed unit as the feed solution a simplified schematic diagram of the treatment system is shown in fig 1 it was worth noting that the design of this combined process avoids the problems resulting from the low concentration of the dilute stream and the relatively large concentration difference in the ed stack though the same effect can be achieved by using a two stage ed process ro is better than the second stage ed because of its stable product water quality and low energy consumption when the feed solution is at low concentration therein the ed unit chose the batch operation mode and the ed stack adopted the constant current mode the applied current density was determined according to the current voltage relation under the setting operating conditions such as the feed concentration and linear flow velocity a linear flow velocity of 3 7 cm s was adopted in this unit to guarantee the turbulence extent and avoid high pressure in the stack while treating the actual desulfurization wastewater the initial volume ratio of the concentrated stream to the dilute stream was calculated accordingly besides a pressure of 4 83 mpa was adopted in the ro unit 2 4 analysis the concentrations of different streams were determined according to the conductivity of each solution which was measured by a portable conductivity meter cond 3210 wtw germany the relation correlation between conductivity and concentration were shown in table 2 and were calibrated to 25 c and regressed in three different ranges the volume changes of the dilute stream and the concentrated stream in the ed unit were represented by the scales on the two stream tanks a precision of 0 05 l the product water was weighed by an electronic balance ab204 s mettler toledo switzerland besides ss was determined by gravimetric method gb11901 89 3 modelling of the ed process in order to reduce the number of experiments for process optimization a mathematical model was established in this study to simulate the ed process during the ed process the transport of ions and solutions forms the essential mass transport process ions actually hydrated ions are transferred from desalting compartment to concentrating compartment under the force of the electric field at the same time the osmotic pressure difference between desalting and concentrating compartments forces solution usually water to transport across the ion exchange membranes under the pseudo steady state conditions the mass balance of ions and water in the dilute stream d and concentrated stream c for the ed system can be described as follows 19 21 1 j s d n s d d t d n s c d t t b f a m e i n c e l l l b a m g δ c n c e l l 2 j w d n w d d t d n w c d t t w f a m e i n c

condition during the ed process the concentration and volume changes in each compartment can be expressed as follows 5 d c d d t j s c d d v d d t v d 6 d c c d t j s c c d v c d t v c 7 d v d d t j w

and ρ represents γ m w μ m s ρ d eqs 5 8 can be numerically solved once the initial conditions cd t 0 cc t 0 vd t 0 vc t 0 are set 4 results and discussions 4 1 the determination of applied current in this study constant current mode was employed in the ed unit generally the limit current can be determined by analyzing the current voltage curves the applied current of the ed stack can be determined as follows the desulfurization wastewater was desalted to 10 g l in the ed unit whereas the concentrated stream was concentrated to 200 g l or more according to fig s1 the applied current was determined as 12 5 a i 30 ma cm2 based on the above analysis of the limit current determined at 10 g l and a safety factor of 0 8 22 4 2 the mass transfer processes during ed fluxes of ions js and volume change rate jv describe the mass transfer process during the ed which can be determined by a series of experiments fig 2 shows the correlation between js and concentration difference under different current densities the linear treading lines of threes data sets suggest that js decreases slightly with the increase of the concentration differences under different current densities the transport of ions can be divided into two parts the migration caused by applied current and the backward diffusion caused by a concentration difference taking a close look the contribution rate of backward diffusion to the entire ion transport is about 8 2 when the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 this indicates that the influence of backward diffusion on ion transport is very limited fig 3 illustrates the variation of jv in function of the concentration difference under different current densities the absolute value of jv increases with the increase of the concentration difference under different current densities according to linear regression the coefficients in the equation at 30 ma cm2 is φ 5 93 l c and ρ 5 20 10 11 m4 mol s which is in good agreement consistent with the experimental result analyzed by wang et al 23 based on the above results and analysis these equations are in good agreement with the experimental phenomena and can be used to describe the ed process in this study when the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 parameters of the model are determined as follows λ 3 63 10 3 mol c μ 5 20 10 8 m s φ 5 93 l c and ρ 5 20 10 11 m4 mol s 4 3 the concentration degree and water recovery rate actually two figures in ed unit have attracted much attention that is the final concentration of the concentrated stream and the water recovery rate the high final concentration of the concentrated stream contributes to recovery of sodium sulfate the water recovery rate r can be calculated by eq 9 9 r v d v c v d in which v d is the volume of the dilute stream at the end vc and vd are the volumes of the dilute and concentrated stream at the beginning respectively as one of the important operation parameters the initial volume ratio of the dilute stream to the concentrated stream affects both the final concentration and water recovery rate at the same time using the ed model and the parameters determined by experiences the ed process under different initial volume ratios can be described easily fig 4 shows the changes of the final concentration and the water recovery rate respectively at different initial volume ratios the final concentration of the dilute stream is set as 10 g l the final concentration of the concentrated steam is always increasing with the increase of the initial volume ratio when the initial volume ratio exceeds 9 the final concentration of the concentrated steam is about 240 g l and then rises slowly and remains a high level the water recovery rate follows the same trend which remains nearly unchanged when the initial volume ratio is greater than 9 if the applicable range of this model is not taken into consideration even the initial volume ratio is increased from 9 to 50 the final concentration of the concentrated steam will also increase from 236 g l to 276 g l and the water recovery rate will increase from 70 to 75 since the solubility of na2so4 at 0 c is about 4 9 g 100 ml h2o nearly 50 g l further improvement of the final concentration will not significantly enhance the amount of the salt recovered however the great increase of initial volume ratio will lead to higher operation costs while the water recovery will increase slightly the reason is that for a certain amount of wastewater a higher initial volume ratio means more wastewater needs to be treated and more energy will be consumed therefore the initial volume ratio is set to 9 in order to achieve a relatively high final concentration and water recovery rate with all above factors considered in fact the water transport from the dilute stream to the concentrated stream is the main factor preventing the realization of high final concentration 23 and high water recovery rate the water transport can be divided into two parts the electro osmosis and the osmosis the electro osmosis is caused by ion transport which is inevitable in this study the mole ratio of electro osmosis water to the sodium sulphate is about 6 3 which is not consistent with the theoretical value na 3 5 24 so4 2 2 8 25 total 9 8 lu et al 26 also observed similar experimental phenomena which is caused by steric hindrance osmosis in the form of free water molecules is caused by osmotic pressure difference the quantity of water is related to the preparation method of the ion exchange membrane with the increase of concentration difference between the two compartments the osmosis effect is aggravated the slow increase of water recovery rate under high initial volume ratio was shown in fig 5 4 4 the treatment of desulfurization wastewater to investigate the feasibility of the hybrid ed ro system for treating desulfurization wastewater and test its potential industrial application the working performance of ed and ro has been studied in this work the actual desulfurization wastewater without pre treatment was collected from huabei oilfield hebei province china as mentioned above ceramic membrane filtration is employed to remove suspended solids because the ss contented in this effluent can pollute foul the membrane rapidly the ss content in this effluent decreased from 1760 mg l to 2 mg l after pre treatment which meets the requirement of the feed water in the ed unit based on experience and analysis the optimal operation conditions of the ed unit are as follows the linear flow velocity is 3 7 cm s the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 and the initial volume ratio of the dilute stream to the concentrated stream is 9 with the total volume of 25 l the changes of theoretical calculation values and experimental results with time to the concentration of the concentrated stream are shown in fig 5 as it can be seen the experimental results are very close to the theoretical calculation values during the first time period the concentration of the concentrated stream increased almost linearly then the growth of concentration diminishes remarkably and the final concentration is reached over time obviously the rapid increasing of water transport prevents from the achievement of a higher concentration due to the increase of concentration difference after 190 min of operation the desulfurization wastewater was concentrated to 230 g l and the water recovery rate was 70 0 which is consistent with the calculation results ie 230 0 g l and 69 2 furthermore the actual concentration is always slightly lower than the theoretical calculation value during the actual wastewater treatment the deviation is mainly caused by the small quantity low content of nacl in the wastewater another reason is the calculation value of concentration difference between different compartments is slightly lower than the actual situation inside the ed stack during the process after the treatment of the ed unit the desulfurization wastewater is desalted to 10 g l which requires deep desalination before it can be reused considering the efficiency and the investment the ro unit was employed for the deep desalination of the dilute stream in this study a domestic high pressure reverse osmosis membrane was used the operation conditions are as follows the applied pressure is 4 83 mpa and the effective membrane area is 78 5 cm2 the ro unit is operated in batch mode by using the dilute stream as the feed solution which was produced by the ed unit that is to say ro concentrated solution is recirculated to the feed side until the concentration of ro concentrated solution reached the requirement a relatively high pressure is adopted in order to achieve a high concentration in the feed side and the final ro concentrated solution can be returned to the ed unit the performance of the ro membrane was found to be consistent with a 99 6 salt rejection desalination rate under 4 83 mpa and a stable permeate water flux of about 45 l m2h fig 6 presents the performance of the ro unit for deep desalination of the dilute stream during the operation overall the salt rejection rate is relatively stable with a slight decrease as the solution concentration on the feed side of ro increases during the operation as a result of the batch mode adopted a remarkable decrease of the permeate flux was observed during the operation which was mainly caused by the increase of the concentration on the feed side however there was no significant impact on the ro unit because the permeate flux always exceeds 45 l m2h which is a high level in practical applications during the operation the conductivity of the product water which is demonstrated in fig s2 is always below 550 μs cm the product water can be directly charged into water bodies or reused as industrial circulating water without further treatment based on the national standards of prc gb 8978 1996 and gb 50050 1995 the dilute stream of the ed unit is re concentrated to 72 g l efficiently by the ro unit mixed with the ed feed solutions and treated again by the ed unit after being treated by the hybrid ed ro system the actual desulfurization wastewater is concentrated to 230 g l and then the concentrated stream is crystallized at a low temperature around 0 c the sodium sulphate crystals and the product water with relatively low conductivity in this work are demonstrated in fig 7 to test the purity of sodium sulphate crystals x ray diffraction analysis was carried out and the results are shown in fig s4 from the standard xrd spectrogram and experimental xrd spectrogram of na2so4 the recovered na2so4 has the same diffraction peak as the standard data indicating the high purity of the na2so4 sample based on the original analysis of desulfurization wastewater the undesirable diffraction peaks of recyclable na2so4 can be well indexed as a complex structure of insoluble sludge cl ca2 and mg2 in the wastewater based on the weighing method and ion chromatography the quantitative analysis of impurities is shown in table 3 according the national standard of prc gb t 6009 2014 anhydrous sodium sulfate for industrial use these results reveal that the recovered na2so4 from desulfurization wastewater can reach level i in first class standards 4 5 the current efficiency and energy consumption it is impossible that applied current can be used completely for desalination or concentration in the ed stack the current efficiency η which refers to the proportion of the current used for ion transport in the total current applied in membrane stack can be calculated by the following equation 5 η z f δ m n i d t in which z is the charge of ion f is the faraday constant δm is the change in salt content mol during this period t s n is the number of cell pairs of the membrane stack and i is the applied current a the current efficiency can be used to investigate the unexpected phenomena during ed operation such as backward diffusion of ions shunt current and co ions transport it is also a significant reference value for further optimization of optional parameters and stack design the dependence of the current efficiency on the concentration difference at a current density of 30 ma cm2 in this study is demonstrated in fig s3 it can be seen that the current efficiency tends to slightly decrease with the increase of the concentration difference obviously the backward diffusion caused by concentration gradient across the membranes is the main reason the measured current efficiency is between 78 and 91 during the whole process which indicates that ed is an energy efficient process in addition the energy consumption at 30 ma cm2 is demonstrated in fig 8 for convenience ease of analysis the energy consumption is calculated by eq 6 which is expressed as the energy consumed per kilogram sodium sulphate for transferring across the membranes without the loss of electrode

density is 30 ma cm2 is 0 20 0 25 kw h kg na2so4 which is slightly higher than that of nacl solution 18 that is because the affinity of so4 2 to h2o the gibbs free energy is 1000 kj mol is much stronger than that of cl to h2o the gibbs free energy is 317 kj mol 27 it is worth noting that the changes of concentration difference between desalting compartments and concentrating compartments will not cause significant changes of energy consumption when the concentration of the dilute stream is above 10 g l the energy consumption is essentially unchanged which is about 0 21 kw h kg na2so4 when the concentration of the dilute stream is below 10 g l the energy consumption tends to increase rapidly higher than 0 25 kw h kg na2so4 with the decrease of concentration this phenomenon indicates the appearance of the concentration polarization and serious performance degradation of the membrane stack which is in good agreement with the analysis based on limiting current in addition although the actual desulfurization wastewater without softening process was successfully treated by ed and ro combined process chemical precipitation or resin adsorption process may improve the quality of wastewater which may be more suitable for membrane process however it may not be necessary to use chemical precipitation or resin adsorption process before treatment because the concentration of heavy metals in the desulfurization wastewater is relatively low 5 conclusions this research evaluates the efficiency of the hybrid ed ro system to achieve the near zld of desulfurization wastewater the system is also equipped with a low temperature crystallizer to recover and reuse the salts the results indicate pretreatment through ceramic membrane filtration is reliable for removing suspended solids in the ed unit the water transport between compartments is the main factor preventing higher concentration time though the ed model an appropriate initial volume ratio can effectively balance the final concentration and load of the ed unit the wastewater has been successfully concentrated to 230 g l when the applied current density is 30 ma cm2 and the initial volume ratio is 9 in the ro unit the dilute stream of the ed unit can be concentrated again from 10 g l to 70 g l under the pressure of 4 83 mpa of the product water the permeate flux is at a high level and the quality of the product water is good enough to be directly loaded into water bodies or reused as industrial circulating water without further treatment as an important factor during membrane operation membrane fouling and scaling are not found in this study overall this laboratory scale study demonstrates that the hybrid ed ro system is an efficient near zld method for treating the desulfurization wastewater to recover and reuse the water and salt as resources looking forward it is promising to apply this technology in the practical wastewater treatment plant declaration of

staphylococcus equorum microbial fuel cell reactive red 120 response surface methodology 1 introduction rapid industrialization has created a lot of positive and negative impacts on the environment the dye using industries such as textile leather plastic paint liquor and pulp and paper continuously discharge their effluent to the environment which is toxic to the human being as well as to the plant and animal kingdom 1 3 the complex structure of these dyes making them difficult in their removal process also they are not aesthetically acceptable 4 5 they possess a tremendous threat to the environment because they are carcinogen toxic mutagenic and stable towards light and heat 6 7 different types of synthetic dye are used in day to day life such as azo anthroquinone nitro thio nitroso indigo etc but 80 of the market is occupied by azo dyes 8 10 azo dyes are characterized by their nn bond and upon degradation sometimes they form toxic compounds such as amine which are a secondary pollutant removal techniques should be selected in such a way that the secondary toxic pollutants should also be removed along with azo dyes 11 13 there are many techniques such as adsorption ion exchange filtration advanced oxidation process for dye removal from these discharges but they have the disadvantage of the generation of secondary pollutants and high cost 14 18 mfc is an emerging green and clean technology that can be used for the removal of dyes due to its several advantages such as no production of secondary waste due to the anaerobic nature of degradation mfcs technologies are better than standalone aerobic and anaerobic bioremediation as it produces electricity along with a higher rate of degradation 19 the biological method of removal of dyes has a disadvantage in that they can only remove the low concentration of dyes as these dyes at high concentrations become toxic to the microorganism although mfc technology is costly it can be used instead of a biological method because of its dual benefit in terms of faster degradation process and energy production 20 fang et al 21 have reported the degradation of reactive brilliant red x 3b up to a concentration of 271 ppm using mfc coupled with a constructed wetland fernando et al 12 have successfully removed acid orange 7 up to 90 at a loading of 210 g m 3 day 1 in an integrated microbial fuel cell with an aerobic two stage bioreactor system a lot of dye degradation such as reactive red 2 acid orange 7 reactive black 5 methyl orange using mfc have been reported by many researchers 2 22 24 recently aiyer et al 25 have assessed microbial electron transfer activity of mfc based on methylene blue dye reduction activity mishra et al 1 have successfully removed a mixture of dyes reactive red 21 and reactive orange 16 at an initial concentration of 50 ppm using pseudomonas aeruginosa 23n1 in mfc the degraded products of azo dyes show cytotoxic and genotoxic characteristics 12 26 reactive red 120 rr120 is a commercially used synthetic azo dye used to color cellulosic fiber 23 27 they contain a reactive group either a halo heterocycle or an activated double bond which are responsible for its binding property with the fiber these dyes have high solubility in water and almost 50 of the dye goes into an effluent 28 29 in mfc the azo dye is degraded by the attack on their azo bond by bacteria thereby producing aromatic amine and further theses amine are either hydrolyzed or oxidized to nontoxic compounds such as alcoholic or keto compound and further degradation leads to smaller compounds such co2 no2 cl n2 so4 etc 30 31 many researchers have reported a large species of bacteria such as paracoccus sp for reactive violet 5 saccharomyces cerevisiae for carmoisine acinetobacter calcoaceticus for amaranth oudemansiella canarii for congo red bacillus cohnii for reactive red 120 etc for degradation of azo dye 32 36 this study reports the degradation of reactive red 120 rr120 in mfc using staphylococcus equorumrap2 the present study investigated the degradation of rr120 in dual chambered mfc a center composite design combined with rsm was used to optimize the degradation of rr120 further rr120 metabolites were identified to establish the biodegradation pathway 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals used rr120 dye was purchased from sigma aldrich 1000 ml stock solution of dye

analytical grade were procured from hi media for the culture maintenance and isolation of bacteria 2 2 isolation and molecular characterization of bacterial isolate the microorganism which could degrade dyes were isolated from the wastewater samples taken from wastewater treatment plant bhagwanpur varanasi india the efficient dye degrading bacterial isolates were screened and isolated at different dilutions 10 6 10 7 and 10 8 at variable dye concentration ranging from 50 to 300 ppm using an agar plating method incubated at 37 c for 24 48 hours for ensuring the purity of a single strain several subsequent subcultures were prepared the bacterial isolates showing higher zones of degradation were isolated and stored at 4 c the molecular characterization of the isolates was done using 16s rrna sequencing performed at bioraj laboratory nagpur india the obtained sequences were subjected to ncbi blast for sequence alignment with reported sequences similar sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignment using clustal w followed by phylogenetic analysis 2 3 the operation of microbial fuel cell mfc used for the present study consists of a dual chambered design made up of perspex a rectangular provision was kept for placing the proton exchange membrane at the center of mfc which divides the cell into two equal parts of 450 ml working volume nafion 117 membrane was used as a proton exchange membrane and carbon cloths were used as electrodes the electrode is suspended from the top of each chambered in such a way that they are fully submerged in the anolyte at the anode dye solution at different concentrations along with mineral media is used as anolyte for closed circuit operation and monitoring voltage across mfc multimeters along with a variable resistance box of 1000 ω were connected in series for dye biodegradation samples were classified based on different combinations of concentrations of dye and ph once these are classified each sample was run in mfc for four days on every 4th day of operation the whole sample was removed and a new sample with 10 inoculums was added in mfc the sample was removed from the mfc chamber and was subjected to centrifugation remi 8c plus india at 5000 rpm for 10 min after centrifugation samples were filtered with a 0 22 μ cellulose based syringe filter and stored at 4 c for further analysis 2 4 analysis of biodegradation of rr120 in mfc 2 4 1 degradation of rr120 the change in absorbance was monitored at 511 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer systronics 119 india the percentage of

modeling and optimization of degradation of rr120 central composite design based rsm was applied for the optimization of the simultaneous degradation of rr120 and the generation of current in the mfc chamber using design expert dx 12 software stat ease inc min neapolis mn usa in this study a face centered central fcc composite design with alpha value 1 was chosen to analyze the optimal level of three variables and their interaction for maximizing degradation of dye with factors a b c as ph initial concentration of dye and time respectively the number of experimental runs was 20 including 6 center points and 14 axial and star points the summary of the design of experiments is shown in table 1 based on the experimental data the model was further subjected to analysis of variance anova and multiple regression analysis with the help of dx 12 0 software 2 6 analysis of degraded metabolites of rr 120 ftir nicolet thermoscientific nicolet usa analysis was done for control dye and its metabolites at the end of the experiment using the kbr pellet method in which samples are mixed with kbr in a ratio of 1 10 transmittance was recorded in the range of wavenumber 400 4000 cm 1 38 lcms was used for the identification of metabolites using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization lc esi technique the extracted metabolites from mfc were sent to sophisticated analytical instrumentation facility saif laboratory central drug research institute cdri lucknow india lcms waters uplc tqd mass spectrometer was used to carry out the analysis in scan mass range of m z 100 2000 negative mode esi ms using the c 18 column for water as solvent 31 2 7 phytotoxicity assay a phytotoxicity study was carried out to analyze the toxicity effect of treated dye samples using staphylococcus equorum in the mfc for this study two very common indian seeds namely wheat sorghum vulgare and mung phaseolusmungo were used twenty seeds of both wheat and mung were cultivated for 10 days in petridish using distilled water pure dye 300 ppm and treated dye obtained from mfc length of plume and radical along with germination was observed during 10 days of cultivation 39 3 results and discussions 3 1 screening and isolation of rr120 degrading bacterial and its identification six morphologically different isolates were obtained using a selective enrichment technique for degradation of the rr120 dye on msm agar plates all six isolates were subjected to degradation of rr120 at a varying concentration ranging from 100 to 300 ppm the most efficient isolate was selected for the degradation of rr120 and was identified as staphylococcus equorum using the 16s rrna gene sequence and was submitted to ncbi genbank with an accession number of mw365319 the phylogenic tree was shown in fig 1 3 2 the operation of mfc mfc was operated at different combinations of ph and concentration of rr120 dye for 80 h the initial concentration of dye 100 200 300 ppm and ph 5 0 7 0 9 0 were chosen based on staphylococcus equorum rap2 activity as enzyme produced by this strain have shown higher activity in the ph range of 4 0 12 0 for dye degradation 40 41 the experimental time was selected in such a way that the maximum degradation and voltage rise should be achieved in the mfc on observation of a voltage drop the whole anolyte was replaced with a new anolyte having different concentrations of dye and ph generally it was done on every 4th day of mfc operation all the data were recorded in triplicates and averages were taken for further calculation fig 2 a showed the variation of voltage at a fixed initial concentration of dye with different ph it is evident in fig 2 a that at ph 7 0 the higher voltage was observed than at ph 5 0 and 9 0 here voltage continuously increases for 72 h thereafter decreases due to a decrease in colony forming unit ml cfu ml the operation of mfc was studied at varying concentrations of dye and a constant ph of 7 0 in fig 2 b the increase of voltage was observed when the initial concentration of dye was increased to 200 ppm and thereafter the voltage drop was observed the highest voltage of 0 52 v was obtained at 200 ppm at ph 0 after 72 h of operation of mfc from fig 2 c it was evident that the power density obtained in the case of ph 7 0 is higher than ph 5 0 and ph 9 0 in fig 2 d the power density obtained within 20 h of operation for 200 and 300 ppm was approximately the same but after 20 h power density for 200 ppm was higher than both 100 and 300 ppm it indicates that with the increased concentration from 100 to 200 ppm the availability of dye promotes more voltage production but after 200 ppm voltage drop started this phenomenon may be attributed to the toxicity of metabolites to microorganisms 42 43 3 3 degradation and cod removal for rr120 in mfc degradation was studied for rr120 at different concentrations 100 300 ppm and ph 5 0 9 0 and it was cleared that dye degradation increases with an increase in the concentration of dye maximum dye degradation was obtained for 300 ppm at 7 ph was 197 71 ppm the same pattern was reported by other researchers 9 44 but the degradation follows the reverse order with the increase in the concentration of dye degradation decreases for the same concentration only ph 7 0 gave the highest degradation than 9 0 and 5 0 this phenomenon may be attributed to the toxicity of the degraded metabolites towards microorganisms at a higher concentration of dyes 34 43 degradation of dyes follows the order for ph 7 0 9 0 5 0 and for concentration ppm 100 200 300 and it was also cleared from the graph that degradation for 100 ppm of dye at ph 7 0 was maximum in all the cases and found to be approximately 100 in 72 h the same pattern was followed for cod removal efficiency with the increased concentration of dyes cod removal efficiency decreased and maximum cod removal efficiency 79 75 for 100 ppm of dye at ph 7 0 was obtained 3 4 statistical modeling and optimization of rr120 degradation electricity generation an empirical relationship between the responses in terms of concentration of dye degraded ppm and design parameters using rsm is given in eq 6 the detailed design of experiments with two responses response 1 and response 2 with their predicted and actual results for the degradation of rr120 is shown in table 2 3 4 1 model response in terms of concentration of dye degraded response 1 is for the concentration of dye degraded and its empirical relation is shown in eq 6 6 c o n c e n t r a t i o n o f d y e d e g r a d e d 152 42 12 71 a 22

a b c ab bc ac a² b2 and c2 and f value 1699 69 indicate model terms are significant and the quadratic model is the best fit for response 1 degradation of dye and independent variable 47 with the results of anova it was observed that linear term ph a concentration b and time c and interactive term concentration and time have positive attributes whereas the interactive term ph and concentration ph and time and quadratic terms of ph concentration and time have negative attributes for the response 1 the predicted model has r² of 0 9920 with the adjusted r² of 0 9988 along with a coefficient of variation of 0 39 and an adequate precision value of 137 375 a ratio greater than 4 which is desirable the relationship between the actual and predicted value of log10 concentration of dye degraded is shown in table 3 3 4 2 analysis of operational parameters of response surface methodology with the help of the regression equation the two dimensional contour and three dimensional 3d surface plots had been developed for a better understanding of the interactive effects of two variables on the responses 48 49 interactive effect of ph a concentration of dye b towards the concentration of dye degraded from fig 3 a b the interactive effect of ph and concentration of dye can be observed as significant with p 0 0001 along with their negative attributes on the dye degradation as the dye concentration increased from 100 ppm to 300 ppm the degradation of dye decreased but with increased ph from 5 to 7 degradation of dye increased but further increased ph decreased the degradation of dye at ph 7 and 200 ppm of dye 176 52 ppm of dye gets degraded as the ph reached acidic 5 76 only 130 95 ppm of dye gets degraded in slightly basic ph 8 53 dye degradation increased to a value of 145 88 ppm than acidic but lower than ph 7 this behavior is supported by many kinds of literature reported earlier 36 50 interactive effect of ph a and time c towards the concentration of dye degraded fig 3 c d shows the interactive effect of ph and time effect on dye on dye degradation which is significant p 0 0001 at a fixed concentration of 182 87 ppm at ph 6 97 degradation increased from 129 61 ppm to 157 16 ppm as time increased from 36 73 h to 59 7 h but as the ph increased from acidic 5 8 to neutral 6 8 dye degradation increased from 105 96 ppm to 141 695 ppm but further increase in ph 8 3 leads to a decrease in dye degradation to only 130 080 ppm overall it has a negative interaction with the dye degradation process the same pattern is observed by many researchers 48 51 interactive effect of time c and concentration b towards the concentration of dye degraded fig 3 e f shows the interactive effect of time and concentration with p value 0 0001 which is significant this interaction has a positive effect on dye degradation as time increased from 38 06 h to 53 39 h dye degradation also increased from 139 84 ppm to 163 55 ppm for 197 ppm of dye at ph 7 17 this work is supported by previously reported literature 50 51 3 4 3 model response in terms of current density response 2 is for current density and its empirical relation is reduced for its significant

shown in table 4 the model f value of 132 72 implies that the model is significant p values less than 0 0500 indicate model terms are significant and the quadratic model is the best fit for response 2 in this case a b a² b² are significant model terms in this ph and time have positive attributes whereas quadratic terms ph and concentration have negative attributes on response 2 current density the interactive effect of ph concentration and time does not affect response 2 the predicted model has r² of 0 9428 with an adjusted r² of 0 9720 along with the coefficient of variation 7 97 and adequate precision value 29 439 which is greater than 4 which is desirable for the model to be the best fit the relationship between actual and predicted value current density is shown in table 3 3 4 4 analysis of operational parameters of response surface methodology interactive effect on current density fig 4 showed the 2d contour and 3d surface plot for current density parameters a ph b concentration c time has a single and quadratic effect on current density and has a significant value with p 0 05 but the ab ac and bc do not have any significant effect on current density 3 4 5 optimized numerical solutions for degradation of dye and current density various responses along with their variables were optimized and solutions are given in table 5 variables like ph concentration and time were kept in the range while response degradation of dye and current density were maximized using an optimization technique from the various solution when the ph was kept 7 19 with a concentration of dye 203 46 in 72 h resulted in maximum dye degradation 180 6 with the 1 066 a m3 current density a quadratic model was found to be the best fit for these parameters the predicted and actual response table 2 has an error of 0 5 which suggests that the model is suitable for predicting the behavior of dye in the microbial fuel cell 3 5 analysis of degraded metabolites of rr 120 3 5 1 functional group identification using ftir analysis ftir spectra are given in fig 5 a showed considerable variation between the treated and the control dye sample spectra fig 5 a obtained at 3854 54 cm 1 is due to oh stretching of benzene substituted alcohol and at 3448 39 cm 1 is due to nh stretching of amine group present in rrr120 dye n n stretching of the azo bond was obtained at 1637 18 cm 1 and 1560 28 cm 1 was due to n n stretching of n present inside the benzene ring the peak obtained at 1028 49 cm 1 and 499 80 cm 1 was due to co stretching of meta substituted azobenzene and fingerprint region of c c out of plane ring bending respectively it can be observed in fig 5 b there are significant increases in transmittance value at 1635 56 cm 1 which is a characteristics peak of azo bond present in the dye which can be concluded that some of the dye presents in mfc get biodegraded and it confirms the breakdown of azo bond preset in the dye some new peaks were also obtained at 1419 14 cm 1 and a shift in the peak was obtained at 500 10 cm 1 and 469 02 cm 1 which is due to aromatic ring stretching fingerprint region and corresponds to the oh out of plane bending vibration and fingerprint region of c c out of plane ring bending respectively these significant peak shifts and the generation of new peaks confirmed the biodegradation of rr120 dye in mfc 27 52 3 5 2 degradation pathway using lcms analysis during the biodegradation of rr120 many stable and unstable metabolites are formed but only those that are stable can be detected in lcms analysis a possible mechanism of rr120 degradation could be the cleavage of nn azo bonds which generates many unknown and known intermediate lcms spectra for pure rr120 dye and its metabolites is given in supplementary data lcms spectra for metabolites evident that smaller molecular weight compounds are formed which is due to biodegradation of rr120 these spectra revealed 2 amino 3 phenylpropanoic acid m z 165 2 and 2 amino 3 2 hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid m z 181 3 3 amino 5 4 amino 6 chloro 1 3 5 triazin 2 yl amino 4 hydroxynaphthalene 2 sulfonic acid m z 383 1 etc as known intermediates swarnkuma et al 39 had reported the same compounds as degraded products when rr120 get decolorized using pseudomonas guariconensis the complete catabolic pathway of rr120 degradation using staphylococcus equorum has to be studied many pathways are proposed by researchers in which many amino derivatives are produced as intermediates such as 2 amino 3 phenylpropanoic acid 2 2 amino 2 formylethyl 3 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 2 amino 2 formylethyl 3 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 amino 3 2 hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid 2 amino 3 2 6 dihydroxyphenyl propanoic acid 3 hydroxyphthalic acid benzene 1 4 diamine 2 hydroxybenzoic acid 8 aminonaphthalene 1 2 3 6 tetraol 3 amino 5 4 amino 6 chloro 1 3 5 triazin 2 yl amino 4 hydroxynaphathalene 2 sulfonic acid 3 amino 4 hydroxynaphthalene 2 7 disulfonic acid chloro 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine 39 53 54 the proposed pathway for biodegradation of rr120 by staphylococcus equorum rap2 is given in fig 6 and these metabolites were are reported to be used by bacteria for their growth and maintained which could be the reason for its complete mineralization the complete catabolic pathway for metabolites of rr120 has to be studied 3 5 3 phytotoxicity assay germination in case of control distilled water treated rr 120 dye and rr 120 dye wastewater was found to be in the range of 91 96 74 88 and 31 58 respectively most of the seeds were germinated in the case of control whereas treated dye had more number of germinated seeds than untreated there was also a difference in length of the plume and radical in treated dye wastewater and untreated dye which confirmed that the treatment of dye in mfc toxicity was decreased the significant difference in length of the plume and radical in control and treated dye wastewater could be attributed to the presence of intermediates arises due to dye degradation 4 conclusion the present study successfully demonstrated the degradation of reactive red 120 dyes by staphylococcus equorum rap2 in mfc almost 90 dye 100 ppm was removed in 72 h of operation at ph 7 with the increases in concentration from 100 to 200 ppm voltage and power density gets increased but thereafter both decreases due to toxicity of dye towards microorganism a maximum voltage of 0 52 v at 200 ppm was observed at 7 ph after 72 h of operation during this maximum dye degradation was observed for 300 ppm initial concentration of dye and found to be 197 91 ppm cod also get reduced to a sufficient value and maximum cod removal 79 75 was observed at 100 ppm of dye predicted r2 values for dye degradation were found to be 0 9920 and for current density r2was found to be 0 9428 with p value 0 05 a quadratic model was found to be the best fit for the experiment 3d response surface plot showed the significant interactive effect of all the three parameters on the dye degradation and current density through the box cox design parameters were optimized the optimized solution was further confirmed with the experiments and the predicted and actual value had a very low difference with the error of 0 5 center composite design combined with rsm methodology was effective for determining the optimum degradation condition for reactive red 120 experimental results demonstrated approximately the same condition for the removal of dye as predicted by ccd design methodology significant peak shifts and absence of aromatic ring in ftir data and metabolites detected in lcms after degradation confirms the removal of dye by biodegradation in mfc phytotoxicity studies also revealed that the degraded dye was less toxic and this mfc technology gives the novel solution

binding property with the fiber these dyes have high solubility in water and almost 50 of the dye goes into an effluent 28 29 in mfc the azo dye is degraded by the attack on their azo bond by bacteria thereby producing aromatic amine and further theses amine are either hydrolyzed or oxidized to nontoxic compounds such as alcoholic or keto compound and further degradation leads to smaller compounds such co2 no2 cl n2 so4 etc 30 31 many researchers have reported a large species of bacteria such as paracoccus sp for reactive violet 5 saccharomyces cerevisiae for carmoisine acinetobacter calcoaceticus for amaranth oudemansiella canarii for congo red bacillus cohnii for reactive red 120 etc for degradation of azo dye 32 36 this study reports the degradation of reactive red 120 rr120 in

negative mode esi ms using the c 18 column for water as solvent 31 2 7 phytotoxicity assay a phytotoxicity study was carried out to analyze the toxicity effect of treated dye samples using staphylococcus equorum in the mfc for this study two very common indian seeds namely wheat sorghum vulgare and mung phaseolusmungo were used twenty seeds of both wheat and mung were cultivated for 10 days in petridish using distilled water pure dye 300 ppm and treated dye obtained from mfc length of plume and radical along with germination was observed during 10 days of cultivation 39 3 results and discussions 3 1 screening and isolation of rr120 degrading bacterial and its identification six morphologically different isolates were obtained using a selective enrichment technique for degradation of the rr120 dye on msm agar plates all six isolates were subjected to degradation of rr120 at a varying concentration ranging from 100 to 300 ppm the most efficient isolate was selected for the degradation of rr120 and was identified as staphylococcus equorum using the 16s rrna gene sequence and was submitted to ncbi genbank with an accession number of mw365319 the phylogenic tree was shown in fig 1 3 2 the operation of mfc mfc was operated at different combinations of ph and concentration of rr120 dye for 80 h the initial concentration of dye 100 200 300 ppm and ph 5 0 7 0 9 0 were chosen based on staphylococcus equorum rap2 activity as enzyme produced by this strain have shown higher activity in the ph range of 4 0 12 0 for dye degradation 40 41 the experimental time was selected in such a way that the maximum degradation and voltage rise should be achieved in the mfc on observation of a voltage drop the whole anolyte was replaced with a new anolyte having different concentrations of dye and ph generally it was done on every 4th day of mfc operation all the data were recorded in triplicates and averages were taken for further calculation fig 2 a showed the variation of voltage at a fixed initial concentration of dye with different ph it is evident in fig 2 a that at ph 7 0 the higher voltage was observed than at ph 5 0 and 9 0 here voltage continuously increases for 72 h thereafter decreases due to a decrease in colony forming unit ml cfu ml the operation of mfc was studied at varying concentrations of dye and a constant ph of 7 0 in fig 2 b the increase of voltage was observed when the initial concentration of dye was increased to 200 ppm and thereafter the voltage drop was observed the highest voltage of 0 52 v was obtained at 200 ppm at ph 0 after 72 h of operation of mfc from fig 2 c it was evident that the power density obtained in the case of ph 7 0 is higher than ph 5 0 and ph 9 0 in fig 2 d the power density obtained within 20 h of operation for 200 and 300 ppm was approximately the same but after 20 h power density for 200 ppm was higher than both 100 and 300 ppm it indicates that with the increased concentration from 100 to 200 ppm the availability of dye promotes more voltage production but after 200 ppm voltage drop started this phenomenon may be attributed to the toxicity of metabolites to microorganisms 42 43 3 3 degradation and cod removal for rr120 in mfc degradation was studied for rr120 at different concentrations 100 300 ppm and ph 5 0 9 0 and it was cleared that dye degradation increases with an increase in the concentration of dye maximum dye degradation was obtained for 300 ppm at 7 ph was 197 71 ppm the same pattern was reported by other researchers 9 44 but the degradation follows the reverse order with the increase in the concentration of dye degradation decreases for the same concentration only ph 7 0 gave the highest degradation than 9 0 and 5 0 this phenomenon may be attributed to the toxicity of the degraded metabolites towards microorganisms at a higher concentration of dyes 34 43 degradation of dyes follows the order for ph 7 0 9 0 5 0 and for concentration ppm 100 200 300 and it was also cleared from the graph that degradation for 100 ppm of dye at ph 7 0 was maximum in all the cases and found to be approximately 100 in 72 h the same pattern was followed for cod removal efficiency with the increased concentration of dyes cod removal efficiency decreased and maximum cod removal efficiency 79 75 for 100 ppm of dye at ph 7 0 was obtained 3 4 statistical modeling and

shown in table 3 3 4 2 analysis of operational parameters of response surface methodology with the help of the regression equation the two dimensional contour and three dimensional 3d surface plots had been developed for a better understanding of the interactive effects of two variables on the responses 48 49 interactive effect of ph a concentration of dye b towards the concentration of dye degraded from fig 3 a b the interactive effect of ph and concentration of dye can be observed as significant with p 0 0001 along with their negative attributes on the dye degradation as the dye concentration increased from 100 ppm to 300 ppm the degradation of dye decreased but with increased ph from 5 to 7 degradation of dye increased but further increased ph decreased the degradation of dye at ph 7 and 200 ppm of dye 176 52 ppm of dye gets degraded as the ph reached acidic 5 76 only 130 95 ppm of dye gets degraded in slightly basic ph 8 53 dye degradation increased to a value of 145 88 ppm than acidic but lower than ph 7 this behavior is supported by many kinds of literature reported earlier 36 50 interactive effect of ph a and time c towards the concentration of dye degraded fig 3 c d shows the interactive effect of ph and time effect on dye on dye degradation which is significant p 0 0001 at a fixed concentration of 182 87 ppm at ph 6 97 degradation increased from 129 61 ppm to 157 16 ppm as time increased from 36 73 h to 59 7 h but as the ph increased from acidic 5 8 to neutral 6 8 dye degradation increased from 105 96 ppm to 141 695 ppm but further increase in ph 8 3 leads to a decrease in dye degradation to only 130 080 ppm overall it has a negative interaction with the dye degradation process the same pattern is observed by many researchers 48 51 interactive effect of time c and concentration b towards the concentration of dye degraded fig 3 e f shows the interactive effect of time and concentration with p value 0 0001 which is significant this interaction has a positive effect on dye degradation as time increased from 38 06 h to 53 39 h dye degradation also increased from 139 84 ppm to 163 55 ppm for 197 ppm of dye at ph 7 17 this work is supported by previously reported literature 50 51 3 4 3 model response in terms of current density response 2 is for current density and its empirical relation is reduced for its significant

shown in table 4 the model f value of 132 72 implies that the model is significant p values less than 0 0500 indicate model terms are significant and the quadratic model is the best fit for response 2 in this case a b a² b² are significant model terms in this ph and time have positive attributes whereas quadratic terms ph and concentration have negative attributes on response 2 current density the interactive effect of ph concentration and time does not affect response 2 the predicted model has r² of 0 9428 with an adjusted r² of 0 9720 along with the coefficient of variation 7 97 and adequate

analysis of operational parameters of response surface methodology interactive effect on current density fig 4 showed the 2d contour and 3d surface plot for current density parameters a ph b concentration c time has a single and quadratic effect on current density and has a significant value with p 0 05 but the ab ac and bc do not have any significant effect on current density 3 4 5 optimized numerical solutions for degradation of dye and current density various responses along with their variables were optimized and solutions are given in table 5 variables like ph concentration and time were kept in the range while response degradation of dye and current density were maximized using an optimization technique from the various solution when the ph was kept 7 19 with a concentration of dye 203 46 in 72 h resulted in maximum dye degradation 180 6 with the 1 066 a m3 current density a quadratic model was found to be the best fit for these parameters the predicted and actual response table 2 has an error of 0 5 which suggests that the model is suitable for predicting the behavior of dye in the microbial fuel cell 3 5 analysis of degraded metabolites of rr 120 3 5 1 functional group identification using ftir analysis ftir spectra are given in fig 5 a showed considerable variation between the treated and the control dye sample spectra fig 5 a obtained at 3854 54 cm 1 is due to oh stretching of benzene substituted alcohol and at 3448 39 cm 1 is due to nh stretching of amine group present in rrr120 dye n n stretching of the azo bond was obtained at 1637 18 cm 1 and 1560 28 cm 1 was due to n n stretching of n present inside the benzene ring the peak obtained at 1028 49 cm 1 and 499 80 cm 1 was due to co stretching of meta substituted azobenzene and fingerprint region of c c out of plane ring bending respectively it can be observed in fig 5 b there are significant increases in transmittance value at 1635 56 cm 1 which is a characteristics peak of azo bond present in the dye which can be concluded that some of the dye presents in mfc get biodegraded and it confirms the breakdown of azo bond preset in the dye some new peaks were also obtained at 1419 14 cm 1 and a shift in the peak was obtained at 500 10 cm 1 and 469 02 cm 1 which is due to aromatic ring stretching fingerprint region and corresponds to the oh out of plane bending vibration and fingerprint region of c c out of plane ring bending respectively these significant peak shifts and the generation of new peaks confirmed the biodegradation of rr120 dye in mfc 27 52 3 5 2 degradation pathway using lcms analysis during the biodegradation of rr120 many stable and unstable metabolites are formed but only those that are stable can be detected in lcms analysis a possible mechanism of rr120 degradation could be the cleavage of nn azo bonds which generates many unknown and known intermediate lcms spectra for pure rr120 dye and its metabolites is given in supplementary data lcms spectra for metabolites evident that smaller molecular weight compounds are formed which is due to biodegradation of rr120 these spectra revealed 2 amino 3 phenylpropanoic acid m z 165 2 and 2 amino 3 2 hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid m z 181 3 3 amino 5 4 amino 6 chloro 1 3 5 triazin 2 yl amino 4 hydroxynaphthalene 2 sulfonic acid m z 383 1 etc as known intermediates swarnkuma et al 39 had reported the same compounds as degraded products when rr120 get decolorized using pseudomonas guariconensis the complete catabolic pathway of rr120 degradation using staphylococcus equorum has to be studied many pathways are proposed by researchers in which many amino derivatives are produced as intermediates such as 2 amino 3 phenylpropanoic acid 2 2 amino 2 formylethyl 3 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 2 amino 2 formylethyl 3 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 amino 3 2 hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid 2 amino 3 2 6 dihydroxyphenyl propanoic acid 3 hydroxyphthalic acid benzene 1 4 diamine 2 hydroxybenzoic acid 8 aminonaphthalene 1 2 3 6 tetraol 3 amino 5 4 amino 6 chloro 1 3 5 triazin 2 yl amino 4 hydroxynaphathalene 2 sulfonic acid 3 amino 4 hydroxynaphthalene 2 7 disulfonic acid chloro 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine 39 53 54 the proposed pathway for biodegradation of rr120 by staphylococcus equorum rap2 is given in fig 6 and these metabolites were are reported to be used by bacteria for their growth and maintained which could be the reason for its complete mineralization the complete catabolic pathway for metabolites of rr120 has to be studied 3 5 3 phytotoxicity assay germination in case of control distilled water treated rr 120 dye and rr 120 dye wastewater was found to be in the range of 91 96 74 88 and 31 58 respectively most of the seeds were germinated in the case of control whereas treated dye had more number of germinated seeds than untreated there was also a difference in length of the plume and radical in treated dye wastewater and untreated dye which confirmed that the treatment of dye in mfc toxicity was decreased the significant difference in length of the plume and radical in control and treated dye wastewater could be attributed to the presence of intermediates arises due to dye degradation 4 conclusion the present study successfully demonstrated the degradation of reactive red 120 dyes by staphylococcus equorum rap2 in mfc almost 90 dye 100 ppm was removed in 72 h of operation at ph 7 with the increases in concentration from 100 to 200 ppm voltage and power density gets increased but thereafter both decreases due to toxicity of dye towards microorganism a maximum voltage of 0 52 v at 200 ppm was observed at 7 ph after 72 h of operation during this maximum dye degradation was observed for 300 ppm initial concentration of dye and found to be 197 91 ppm cod also get reduced to a sufficient value and maximum cod removal 79 75 was observed at 100 ppm of dye predicted r2 values for dye degradation were found to be 0 9920 and for current density r2was found to be 0 9428 with p value 0 05 a quadratic model was found to be the best fit for the experiment 3d response surface plot showed the significant interactive effect of all the three parameters on the dye degradation and current density through the box cox design parameters were optimized the optimized solution was further confirmed with the experiments and the predicted and actual value had a very low difference with the error of 0 5 center composite design combined with rsm methodology was effective for determining the optimum degradation condition for reactive red 120 experimental results demonstrated approximately the same condition for the removal of dye as predicted by ccd design methodology significant peak shifts and absence of aromatic ring in ftir data and metabolites detected in lcms after degradation confirms the removal of dye by biodegradation in mfc phytotoxicity studies also revealed that the degraded dye was less toxic and this mfc technology gives the novel solution

13649,electrocoagulation ec has attracted attention during the recent years due to its ease of use and high removal rate of organic and inorganic pollutants it was found that using ec as a pretreatment process can decrease the overall energy consumption and improve the treated water quality this literature review evaluates the efficiency of integrating ec process with other water treatment processes including membranes chemical electromagnetic and oxidation processes the studied technologies were ultrafiltration ec uf reverse osmosis ec ro forward osmosis ec fo membrane distillation ec md forward osmosis membrane distillation ec fo md membrane bioreactor ec mbr electrodialysis ec ed ozonation ec o3 ultraviolet ec uvc vuv peroxi electrocoagulation ec h2o2 activated carbon adsorption ec ac biofiltration ec bf and electro oxidation ec eo the overall performance was evaluated using pollutants removal efficiency energy consumption and operational cost then the performance of pilot scale hybrid electrocoagulation processes and the current status of implementation was discussed the future potential of electrocoagulation lies with proper hybridization of ec with other water treatment processes that would minimize the overall cost and enhance quality of the treated water keywords electrocoagulation hybrid processes water wastewater wastewater treatment 1 introduction water sacristy is one of the most challenging problems of the current century 2 billion people do not have convenient access to potable water 1 due to inadequate water and sanitation an average of 780 000 people died annually 2 moreover around 55 million people are affected by drought causing more than us 5 billion of economic damage the use of water is increasing by 1 every year since 1980 and it is estimated to continue until 2050 water demand is generated by several sectors including residential agricultural and industrial sector wastewater treatment could be a solution for the water scarcity problem the conventional wastewater treatment contains three main stages namely primary treatment secondary treatment and tertiary treatment tertiary treatment is important because it generates water suitable for various industrial agriculture and residential applications in the tertiary treatment it was found that membrane filtration has many disadvantages such as high energy consumption and membrane fouling in this context focus is set on hybridization of electrocoagulation ec process which would make it suitable for the treatment of water and wastewater sustainable water desalination and water reuse by using its intrinsic ability of removing organic and inorganic pollutants hybrid electrocoagulation processes has attracted more research attention during the last decade fig 1 ec process is capable of removing multiple types of pollutants including total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod heavy metals total suspended solids oil emulsions turbidity and color from water and wastewater 3 7 ec was found to be highly efficient pre treatment process compared with chemical coagulation and flocculation considering the removal rate of pollutants and ease of use 8 10 the hybridization of ec process with other treatment technologies must be selected properly to enhance the removal efficiency and reduce energy consumption this paper evaluates the efficiency of pairing ec with other treatment processes namely ultrafiltration ec uf reverse osmosis ec ro forward osmosis ec fo membrane distillation ec md forward osmosis membrane distillation ec fo

ec eo in this review paper these hybrid systems will be thoroughly discussed with emphasis on the enhancements limitation and future aspects with a focus on water treatment and energy efficiency enhancement to the authors knowledge there is no reported review paper on ec hybrid systems 2 electrocoagulation process electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical process used for the treatment of water and wastewater ec is an environmentally friendly process because it generates low amount of sludge and does not require the addition of chemicals in the electrochemical process the current is applied to dissolve the metal from sacrificial anodes immersed in the polluted water the applied current also destabilized the contaminants into charged particles that are neutralized with the ions of opposite electrical charges supplied by the ec process later the agglomerated particles precipitate in a stable form overall the mechanisms that occur during the ec process are mentioned below 11 14 a generation of metal ions by anodes dissolution eq 1 oxidation of water at anode eq 2 and production of hydrogen gas at the cathode eq 3 the overall reaction for the production of iron hydroxides is shown in eq 4 anode 1 fe s fe2 aq 2e 2 2h2o o2 g 4h 4e cathode 3 2h2o aq 2e h2 g oh overall 4 4fe s 10h2o l o2 aq 4fe oh 3 s 4h2 g b neutralization of surface charge of pollutants suspended particulate matter and emulsions c agglomeration of neutralized particles and its coagulation in the aqueous phase as flocs d precipitation or flotation of the coagulated contaminants by sedimentation and evolved h2 as shown in fig 2 e electrochemical and chemical reactions increasing the cathodic reduction of metal ions and organic contaminants at the cathode surface the generation of coagulants is affected by multiple factors including electrodes material electrodes arrangement electrolysis time electrodes spacing current density initial ph and wastewater content it was found that optimum operational parameters depend on the type of wastewater many studies have discussed the effect of the operational parameters on the ec process thus this review will only present a summary of their impact on the overall efficiency of the process even though the used electrodes material does not contribute in the energy consumption calculations proper electrodes material can enhance the energy consumption and increase the removal efficiency 15 moreover electrodes arrangement has a significant role in enhancing the ec efficiency as reported in many studies 16 24 electrodes arrangement are divided into three types monopolar parallel mp p monopolar series mp s and bipolar series bp s in mp p connection arrangement all anodes are connected with each other and the power supply forming parallel connection with current divided among the electrodes however in mp s the internal electrodes anodes and cathodes are connected with each other while not connected with neither outer electrodes nor power supply forming series connection with current equal to the applied one in bp p connection arrangement all inner electrodes are separated from each other and the power supply different polarity is being introduced on each face of the inner electrodes that depends on the adjacent electrode polarity forming series connection as shown in fig 3 c experimental studies have concluded that as the electrolysis time increased the removal efficiency increased and the energy consumption increased the coexistence of different pollutants can effect the removal efficiency of the targeted contaminant in which the concentration of a specific pollutant can play an inhibitory role in the contaminant removal 25 27 as the electrodes spacing decreased the removal efficiency increased without affecting the energy consumption the initial ph value has an influence on the formation of the hydroxide species the optimum ph value depends on the type of pollutants although increasing the current density enhances the removal efficiency 28 34 the formed flocs might get destroyed at extremely high current 35 to maximize the ec efficiency in terms of the pollutants removal and energy consumption the operating parameters must be studied together 6 ec has gained increasing attention over the past years due to its ease of use high removal efficiency and small amount of sludge 36 37 therefore utilizing ec as a pre treatment process could be an economical solution to remove various pollutants efficiently compared with conventional coagulation 38 while comparing ec and conventional coagulation ec was found to be a valuable replacement to the traditional treatment methods due to the advantages mentioned in table 1 as for the impact of the disadvantages stated in table 1 it can be reduced by the other process in the hybrid system using ec hybrid systems can certainly reduce the need to operate the ec for long time thus reducing the electrodes and energy consumption in recent studies the dielectrophoretic dep force was used to enhance the performance of the ec process dep force enhanced ec process was achieved using novel electrodes arrangement dep enhanced ec process was tested for the treatment of municipal wastewater it was found that using the new electrodes configuration increased the removal efficiency of total phosphorus and cod by 24 and 18 respectively 44 also the electrode corrosion decreased by 87 the same team investigated the effect of using dep enhanced ec process on harvesting of marine macroalgae 45 the main goal of the study was to separate algae from seawater with the minimum concentration of aluminum in the separated algae as the collected algae was to be used in further applications it was found that the aluminum content in the harvested biomass decreased by 52 compared to the conventional ec process another study investigated the performance of dep enhanced ec process on the removal of total organic carbon toc from municipal wastewater 46 it was found that the toc removal increased by 7 2 using dep enhanced ec process compared to conventional ec process in addition the electrodes and energy consumption were 27 3 and 6 respectively less when using dep enhanced ec process at an applied current of 800 ma and 30 min of electrolysis time the studies of inducing dep force into the ec system have managed to efficiently enhance the overall performance of the ec process however the dep enhanced ec has not been used in a hybrid system yet 3 hybrid systems using ec and other methods 3 1 hybrid electrocoagulation membrane processes membrane filtration is one of the most commonly used technologies for desalination and wastewater treatment due to the high recovery rate small space requirement and minimal sludge volume there are different types of membranes including ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo membrane distillation md membrane bioreactor mbr and electrodialysis ed membrane separation processes have high recovery rate depending on the membrane type and feed water quality the main drawbacks of these membrane technologies are membrane fouling and high cost of the membranes membrane fouling can be categorized into organic fouling biofouling and inorganic fouling electrocoagulation can be used as a pretreatment process to remove suspended solids colloids turbidity oil proteins humic acids bacteria and heavy metals therefore using electrocoagulation as pretreatment process could reduce membrane fouling and extend the membrane lifecycle 3 1 1 electrocoagulation ultrafiltration ec uf ultrafiltration is a low pressure and cost effective membrane treatment process it is a membrane filtration process which operates using hydrostatic pressure to force water particles through a semi permeable membrane while suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight were retained 47 however uf process suffers from membrane fouling causing a huge drop in the efficiency of the water recovery due to accumulation of particles on the membrane surface and across the membrane pores 48 49 suspended solids and organic pollutants are considered the main foulants in the uf membrane process therefore the removal of suspended solids and organic pollutants using electrocoagulation could be a suitable mitigation method for membrane fouling 50 also the final water quality obtained using the uf process could be enhanced due to the lower amount of pollutants available in the feed water sardari et al 50 conducted a research where 5 aluminum electrodes were placed in the ec process 0 9 cm apart from one another arranged in bp s mode with a dc power supply and current density of 3 ma cm2 fig 4 the poultry processing water ppw was pretreated using the ec process prior to the ultrafiltration process for 5 min the removal efficiency was 87 for bod 59 for cod 94 for fog and 84 for tss with an energy consumption of 0 15 kw h m3 removal of these pollutants led to a higher initial permeate flux and a lower flux decline during the ultrafiltration process in the ultrafiltration process regenerated cellulose rc membrane was used at a flow rate of 1 2 l min and an applied pressure of 70 kpa the initial flux was found to be approximately 97 l m2h and dropped to 55 l m2h reduction of 43 at 500 ml of permeate volume moreover the removal efficiencies were 87 for bod 82 for cod 95 for tss 95 for fog and 55 for protein when uf was used individually the hybrid ec uf process resulted in a higher quality permeate where the removal rate of tss and fog were 100 cod was 92 residual 70 mg l bod was 98 residual 40 mg l and protein was 90 residual 45 mg l during the short term analysis of the uf process when using ec as pretreatment the water flux reduced from 102 l m2h to 91 l m2h reduction of 10 8 at 500 ml of permeate volume long term analysis was conducted to further investigate the advantages of using the ec system as a pretreatment process before ultrafiltration process in the hybrid process the initial flux was 106 l m2h and dropped to 46 l m2h in the first day of experiment and 22 l m2h after seven days the water flux reached to 0 l m2h after three days of operation using ultrafiltration alone in the hybrid process the initial water flux was retrieved by washing the membrane with fresh water for more than 6 running cycles a summary of the experiments is provided in table 2 3 1 2 electrocoagulation reverse osmosis ec ro reverse osmosis ro is a usually combined with other treatment processes to maximize the treatment efficiency and reduce the membrane fouling issues 51 52 ro suffers from membrane fouling including biofouling and organic fouling 53 54 organic fouling is caused by the accumulation of oil proteins humic acids polysaccharides and lipids on the ro membrane surface 55 biofouling is caused by the adhesion and accumulation of bacteria fungi and yeast 55 ec process can be used as a pretreatment process for ro to remove such pollutants researchers have recently started to investigate the applicability of using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process for ro it was found that ec can be an appropriate pretreatment process for ro since it can reduce the amount of organic matter that causes organic membrane fouling and biofouling 56 57 hakizimana et al 2015 investigated the influence of using ec as a pretreatment process prior to ro for the desalination of sea water 58 the main parameters that were studied in ec process are the initial ph current density stirring speed and electrodes spacing using two aluminum electrodes and dc power supply ec performance was measured based on the removal rates of organic matters like dissolved organic carbon doc and absorbance the removal efficiency increased as the ph and electrodes spacing decreased at current density of 5 6 ma cm2 the optimum ec parameters were found to be 90 rpm stirring speed ph of 4 electrode spacing of 1 cm and running time of 30 min the energy consumption was 0 17 kw h m3 while the removal efficiencies were 57 5 for doc residual 0 57 mg l 81 for absorbance residual 0 37 m 1 and 10 for hardness residual 6008 mg l as per the achieved results it was found that the removal rate of aromatic compounds was higher than aliphatic compounds moreover due to the lower removal efficiency of hardness ec was found to be weak in the removal of scaling ions zhao et al 59 illustrated the advantages of using ec before ro to reduce membrane fouling from the treatment of produced water three iron anodes and three graphite cathodes were used in the ec process with a total number of 6 electrodes electrode spacing of 1 5 cm was used and were connected in mp p mode as shown in fig 5 the ec parameters that were investigated in this study were residence time current density and initial ph value ec effectiveness was evaluated by analyzing the removal rates of cod turbidity and hardness by preliminary analysis it was concluded that the optimum operating conditions are operational time of 30 min current density of 5 9 ma cm2 and an initial ph of 7 36 the ec system achieved a cod turbidity and hardness removal rates of 66 64 93 8 and 85 81 respectively treated water was pumped to the ro process at a flow rate of 0 8 l min and 2 mpa pressure was applied a comparison was made between raw water sample and pretreated water sample it was noted that a sudden decline occurred in the water flux while using raw water after 60 min due to the excess amount of organics and scaling compounds in the feed water after 90 min the water flux dropped to 4 l m2h and 26 l m2h using raw water and pretreated water respectively the permeate flux dropped to 22 l m2 h after 200 min using pretreated feed water therefore after using ec as pretreatment process prior to ro the allowable filtration period increased by 55 additionally the removal efficiency of cod oil turbidity conductivity and hardness was 95 7 residual 12 mg l 99 9 residual 0 86 mg l 99 1 residual 1 26 ntu 81 5 556 μs cm and 99 5 residual 1 37 mg l using ec ro results have proven that using ec as a pretreatment process before using ro for treating produced water enhanced the ro process and produced better water quality den and wang et al 2008 have stated similar conclusion for the treatment of brackish water using hybrid ec ro process 60 the ec process consisted of 5 aluminum electrodes connected in bipolar series bp s mode at optimum conditions the applied current was 3 47 ma cm2 generated using a dc power supply and 30 min electrolysis time the highest removal efficiency of silica achieved was 80 residual 39 mg l the constant pressure and flow rate used in the ro process were 0 5 mpa and 0 8 l min respectively da silva et al 61 have done experiments on the treatment of oily wastewater using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process followed by ro process they have studied the effect of using dc ac power source with various current density electrode type aluminum or iron and operational time 4 pairs of electrodes were used with an electrode spacing of 1 cm arranged in a monopolar series mp s mode as shown in fig 5 the results obtained from the variable runs of ec confirmed that using aluminum electrodes had a larger removal rates than iron electrodes and ac power supply has almost half the electrode consumption compared to dc power supply while using current density of 1 85 ma cm2 and operational time of 6 min the removal efficiency was of 99 5 for turbidity 97 98 for cod and 99 reduction in absorbance at 400 nm the conductivity increased by 12 due to the secretion of ions in the water the pretreated water was pumped to ro process using applied pressure of 1 3 mpa for 2 h it was concluded that increasing both operating pressure and net driving pressure did not affect the removal efficiency through the ro membrane thus 1 mpa was selected as the optimum applied pressure the removal efficiency of the ro process from raw effluent was 99 5 of aluminum ions residual 0 1 mg l 97 3 of tds residual 35 mg l and 99 1 of conductivity from ro feed residual 23 μs cm alongside the collected data ro has further reduced the turbidity from 3 ntu to 1 ntu 66 7 removal efficiency from ro feed and 99 9 total removal ec ro and a total removal 100 of absorbance at 400 nm and cod the pollutants removal efficiency was not affected by the pressure applied in ro the averaged permeate flux was 18 49 lm 2 h 1 at net driving pressure of 2 874 mpa it was noted that less than 10 of the permeate flux was reduced throughout the experiment similar results were also obtained for the treatment of well water by sadeddin et al 62 they have used 2 stainless steel electrodes connected to a dc power supply at 60 min electrolysis time and applied current of 1 75 a the removal efficiencies of turbidity and tss using ec alone were 98 residual 3 ntu and 99 residual 3 mg l respectively ro was operated for a period of 6 months using the pretreated water as feed water it was concluded that the addition of ec has enhanced the ro system in terms of pressure drop silt density index sdi and water flow the feed water had less than 3 min of sdi which is considered suitable for ro plants concluding remarks were made that the ro process was effective in removing the dissolved particles while the combination of ec ro had greater potential in removing different kinds of pollutants at higher removal efficiency a summary of the operational parameters of ec and ro along with the results achieved are mentioned in table 2 3 1 3 electrocoagulation forward osmosis ec fo forward osmosis fo is a promising membrane process for freshwater production it is considered a low energy membrane process because it operates using natural osmotic pressure gradient low water flux and membrane fouling are considered as the drawback for the fo process 63 64 several studies have been done on using fo for the treatment of oil gas produced water however the performance of this process was negatively affected by the oil content in water the accumulation of oil droplets on the membrane surface caused severe membrane fouling and high concentration polarization 65 therefore using ec as a pretreatment process can reduce the amount of oil content in the feed draw solution which mitigates the membrane fouling and enhances the performance of the fo process al hawli et al 2019 designed and tested a lab scale hybrid ec fo process for the treatment of produced water as shown in fig 6 66 two aluminum plates each with the area of 53 9 cm2 were used as the cathode and anode three different current densities of 10 30 and 60 ma cm2 were applied using direct current dc power supply in the ec process the optimum experimental time and current density were found to be 10 min and 10 ma cm2 the oil and grease o g removal was 97 4 residual 24 7 ppm conductivity removal was 5 6 the tss removal efficiency was 97 1 turbidity removal was 91 6 and the toc removal was 91 3 the energy consumption of the ec was found to be 0 093 kw h m3 in the fo process the ec treated produced water was used as the draw solution treated sewage effluent was used as the feed solution two different orientations were investigated in the fo process fo mode active layer facing feed solution and pro mode active layer facing draw solution and it was operated for 1000 min three different flow rates of 0 8 1 2 and 2 lpm were tested in the fo process the highest water recovery rate of 9 2 was obtained using pro mode at flow rate of 1 2 lpm overall the hybrid system removed a total of 98 residual 18 3 ntu 99 residual 31 2 ppm and 16 3 residual 79 μs cm turbidity tss and conductivity respectively sadari et al 2018 developed a lab scale hybrid ec fo process for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing produced water 67 in the ec process the setup consisted of five aluminum electrodes each with the surface area of 180 cm2 that placed with a spacing of 0 8 cm connected to a dc power supply the current density was maintained at 2 78 ma cm2 with different experimental times of 1 2 and 3 min the tss removal was 96 residual 25 6 mg l the toc removal was 82 residual 27 8 mg l and the turbidity removal was 97 residual 3 51 ntu at an operational time of 2 min the energy consumption of using ec at the optimum condition is 0 35 kw h m3 in the fo process 4 m nacl was used as the draw solution and two feed solutions were tested raw produced water and ec treated produced water the flow rate was 0 8 l min and membrane orientation was in fo mode the water flux while using ec pretreated draw solution was 23 5 higher than the water flux of the raw produced water table 2 summarizes the operating parameters and results obtained using ec process and hybrid ec fo process it can be seen from the previous studies that the utilization of electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process has increased the water flux and enhanced the overall water quality current lab scale studies of ec fo hybrids are being conducted for short experimental times therefore pilot scale studies must be done to evaluate the membrane fouling and water production on a larger scale for longer duration 3 1 4 electrocoagulation membrane distillation ec md membrane distillation md is a separation process where vapor molecules passes through a porous hydrophobic membrane 68 the most common configuration is direct contact membrane distillation dcmd because of its high salt rejection rate the permeate water is of very high quality and is suitable for various applications in addition to membrane fouling 69 70 md suffers from membrane wetting which is defined as the permeation of liquid water through the membrane pores that leads to the deterioration of permeate water quality 71 membrane wetting is usually caused by high level of surfactants or contaminants of low surface tension in the feed water 72 73 electrocoagulation has high removal efficiency for dissolved organic matter surfactants and other pollutants of low surface tension 74 therefore using ec as a pretreatment process can reduce membrane wetting in md which could enhance the performance of the md process sardari et at 2018 studied the performance of hybrid ec md setup for treatment of highly saline hydraulic fracturing produced water hpfw 74 as illustrated in fig 7 the ec system consisted of 5 aluminum electrodes spaced 0 5 cm apart and connected to a dc power supply the effect of applied current on the removal rates was observed keeping the reaction time at 0 5 min and an initial ph of 6 4 the removal rate increased as the current increased the removal efficiency at those parameters while using 16 5 ma cm2 were found to be 96 for turbidity residual 8 1 ntu 91 for tss residual 37 3 mg l and 61 for toc residual 37 8 mg l with energy consumption of 1 41 kw h m3 the treated water was left for 6 h for sedimentation prior to using md process md process consisted of ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene ectfe membrane at a flow velocity of 16 7 cm s the water flux after the collection of 2 45 l of permeate increased from 18 l m2h to 70 l m2h for temperatures of 50 and 70 respectively furthermore at fs temperature of 60 the water flux increased from 24 l m2h to 47 l m2h at flow velocities of 5 5 cm s and 16 7 cm s respectively after the end of collecting 2 45 l of permeate it was found that using ec has enhanced the water flux by almost 50 water recovery had reached up to 57 from the hfpw sample containing 135 g l dissolved solids long term tests were also conducted using a flow velocity of 9 3 cm s at a fs temperature of 60 allowing the water flux to reach a rate of 30 l m2h when left for 434 h the combined processes of the ec and md systems to treat hfpw have shown results that were more promising than when the md system was utilized alone if appropriately designed the ec pretreatment could have a higher chance to mitigate the fouling and wetting issues during the md operations however more research is required to study the hybridization of ec and md processes for the treatment of wastewater as only one study has been done 3 1 5 electrocoagulation forward osmosis membrane distillation ec fo md in md process the membrane prevents the transfer of liquid particles due to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane and gas liquid interface 76 also fo suffers from concentration polarization that reduces the osmotic pressure difference the effect of concentration polarization could be minimized using ec as a pretreatment 77 78 sardari et al 79 evaluated the performance of tri hybrid ec fo md process electrocoagulation was used as pretreatment process as shown in fig 8 the hybrid process is expected to lower fouling tendency and enhance permeate water quality the ec system consisted of an electrolytic cell with five aluminum electrodes connected in a monopolar parallel mp p configuration with a dc power source the applied current density was 2 78 ma cm2 and the operational time was 2 min the removal efficiencies of turbidity tss and toc from ec process used alone were more than 91 0 residual 10 6 ntu 95 residual 13 6 mg l and 72 residual 24 1 mg l respectively the treated water from the ec process was left to age for 6 h then placed in the fo md hybrid system the experimental parameters showed that both the fo and md system flow rates were 0 7 l min and the fo temperature was 25 while the md system had a temperature of 60 the draw solution concentration was the only variable in the fo md system as a conclusion the increase of draw solution concentration allowed the water recovery to increase simultaneously using 2 0 m of sodium chloride as a draw solution provided 76 water recovery for the case where water contained low tds pw1 tds 11 2 g l while the water that contained high tds pw2 tds 57 2 g l allowed the water recovery to be 30 all the parameters used in the system are summarized in table 2 also the results obtained using ec alone and the hybrid system ec fo md are mentioned as a result of using ec a pretreatment process to fo md fouling issue was minimized and a stable performance was achieved 3 1 6 electrocoagulation membrane bioreactor ec mbr membrane bioreactor mbr is a combination of a membrane process like microfiltration and biological wastewater treatment process mbr suffers from membrane fouling including organic fouling biofouling and inorganic fouling inorganic fouling is caused by cations and anions such as ca2 mg2 fe3 al3 so4 2 po4 3 co3 2 and oh 80 as mentioned earlier organic fouling is caused by oil proteins humic acids polysaccharides and lipids and biofouling is caused by bacteria fungi and yeast ec process can be used as a pretreatment process for mbr to mitigate membrane fouling 81 82 al malack et al 2018 investigated the treatment of hypersaline oilfield produced water using hybrid ec mbr process 25 the feed solution used in the experiment was synthetic produced water the ec system was set up using 2 electrodes of either aluminum or stainless steel connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 9 the impact of electrode material current density and electrolysis time was studied and found that as the current density and electrolysis time increased the removal efficiency of cod and turbidity increased the highest removal efficiency was achieved using aluminum electrodes current density of 30 ma cm2 and electrolysis time of 120 min as shown in table 2 the removal rate of cod was 65 and turbidity was 52 during the experiments conducted on the ec process the bioreactor membrane was also subjected to tests using synthetic produced water to determine the optimum conditions of that membrane which was manufactured by zenon environmental systems the optimum permeate flux was found to be 12 l m2h and with the increase of permeate flux the transmembrane pressure simultaneously increases until it reaches the maximum allowable pressure for that membrane ec mbr process started after the acclimatization period of 90 days where volatile mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss reached a value of 5000 mg l further experimentation with three phases were conducted in the ec mbr to account the different concentrations of oil which were 100 150 200 mg l using 100 mg l of oil in the hybrid system showed the removal efficiency of cod to be 97 residual 48 mg l and the o g removal to be 95 residual 5 mg l after an operational period of 60 days cod and o g removal efficiencies were reduced to 91 residual 162 mg l and 80 residual 40 mg l respectively when the oil concentration increased to 200 mg l furthermore it was mentioned that the use of ec as pretreatment to mbr process has minimized the fouling issue bani melhem et al 2012 studied the impact of using ec process with submerged membrane bioreactor smbr for the treatment of grey water 83 the study was made for a duration of 24 days using the hybrid system the results showed that using ec process has reduced the membrane fouling of smbr by 13 pollutants removal efficiencies of cod turbidity and color were almost the same using the hybrid system and smbr alone for instance cod turbidity and color were reduced by 88 9 residual 51 mg l 97 residual 4 1 ftu and 93 7 residual 26 ptco using ec smbr and 86 residual 65 mg l 94 8 residual 6 9 ftu and 91 2 residual 37 ptco using smbr respectively the removal efficiency of phosphorus was 94 3 residual 0 03 mg l and 65 residual 0 18 mg l for ec smbr and smbr respectively smbr achieved 20 higher removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen 77 8 residual 2 5 mg l and 97 4 residual 0 3 mg l for ec smbr and smbr respectively it was suggested that lower amounts of current and electrodes materials such as iron might further enhance the hybrid system removal efficiency the parameters that were used in the ec process are dc power supply with a potential of 12 v 2 aluminum electrodes spaced at 5 8 cm and 15 min of electrolysis time the transmembrane pressure used in both systems was constant with a value of 7 5 kpa the initial fluxes obtained from ec smbr and smbr were 29 l m2h and 27 5 l m2h respectively short term experiment was also conducted for a period of 24 h it was concluded from the short term experiment that ec smbr has improved the membrane filterability by 20 when compared to smbr process 3 1 7 electrocoagulation electrodialysis ec ed electrodialysis ed is an electricity driven membrane process that uses an electrical current instead of pressure to induce ions through the membrane its high selectivity high product recovery ratio and ability to destroy majority of the components in the raw water has made the system a favorable process to treat water however it is sometimes necessary to use one or two more systems to ensure the efficient treatment of wastewater deghles and kurt 2016 investigated the efficiency of combining an electrocoagulation system with the electrodialysis technology in order to remove cod nh3 n cr and color from tannery wastewater 85 as shown in table 2 the ec set up consisted of 5 pairs of electrodes with 0 7 cm space between them in monopolar parallel mpp arrangement and connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 10 the study analyzed the impact of electrodes material aluminum and iron when the initial ph of 6 for aluminum and 7 for the iron electrodes were set current density and electrolysis time were the major variables in the ec process that was taken under observation at optimum run the current density was found to be 14 ma cm2 and electrolysis time 125 min using aluminum electrodes the removal efficiencies were concluded to be 73 for cod 51 for nh3 n 94 for color and 100 for cr with an energy consumption of 6 75 kwh m3 the bipolar membrane electrodialysis was utilized as the post treatment to ec system the potential applied was kept at a constant of 24 v for all experiments while the electrodes were rinsed by using hydrogen chloride with a concentration of 0 01 m the electrodes were platinized titanium in the anode and cathode spaced by 0 05 cm with this hybrid system the energy consumption of electrodialysis for a period of 45 min was 14 kwh m3 at a current density of 190 ma cm2 when aluminum electrodes were used in the ec process as a result of using this hybrid system the removal efficiencies were 98 3 for conductivity residual 0 397 μs cm 92 for cod residual 224 mg l 100 for cr 100 for nh3 n 100 for ammonium and 100 for color the results showed a decrease in all parameters tested thus the coupling of the ec system with the ed technology has improved the removal efficiency of the different pollutants present in the wastewater sample along with significantly reducing the volume of effluent discharged 3 2 hybrid electrocoagulation oxidation processes oxidation process is widely used in the tertiary stage of wastewater treatment process this is due to the high removal efficiency of organic compounds and heavy metals also this process does not introduce harmful substances into the treated water the main drawback of using oxidation process is the low removal efficiency for pollutants with high molecular weight long processing time and high operating cost especially for feed water with high concentration of pollutants which requires high volume of chemical reagents to operate the system therefore utilizing ec as a pretreatment process for the oxidation processes can eliminate various pollutants at lower cost and a shorter time then the oxidation process can be used to further treat the effluent by removing the excess pollutants 3 2 1 electrocoagulation ozonation ec o3 ozonation o3 is an efficient system that uses ozone as a strong oxidant to decompose many pollutants including dyes however pollutants with high molecular weight cannot be removed using ozonation therefore using electrocoagulation as pretreatment could enhance the overall performance bilinska et 2019 evaluated the performance of hybrid ec o3 process for the treatment of saline water with high dye concentration 86 as shown in fig 11 the ec setup contains 11 electrodes of either aluminum or iron connected in bp s mode with a dc supplier to generate around 20 ma cm2 for the aqueous solution and 100 ma cm2 for the wastewater with an initial ph value of 11 82 in the ec process the iron electrodes were found to be better conductors than the aluminum electrodes due to the high ph value in the water which reduced the efficiency of the aluminum electrodes the removal rate for color was 85 after 10 min of electrolysis however the removal rate did not increase as the electrolysis time increased significantly due to the extremely high ph value in the o3 system 0 3 g l of the ozone was contained in a semi batch stirred cell with a volume of 1 l the feeding parameters utilized were co3 5 mg l and qin 20 l h for the rb5 solutions while the wastewater sample had co3 42 mg l and qin 40 l h in the ozonation process the removal rate of color was 90 after 50 min recommendations were made that the use of ec o3 as a two step process to treat industrial wastewater would be more beneficial than using a one step system due to its lower cost it was also noted that the energy consumption was 3 77 kw h m3 for rb5 and 56 29 kw h m3 for the wastewater solution after using ec as pretreatment the ozonation time reduced from 50 min to 10 min thus reducing the ozonation period by 80 and consequently saving 5 times the amount of ozone dose moreover the total color removal rate was 98 ortega et al 2010 conducted a study on using electrocoagulation coupled with ozonation process and found that the hybrid process was suitable for the treatment of industrial wastewater 87 in the ec process a total of 8 iron electrodes were placed at a spacing of 1 5 cm at optimum conditions the current density was 3 ma cm2 ph value was set in the range of 7 9 and ec was operated for 15 min in the ozonation system a tank reactor of 0 5 l volume was used and the production rate of ozone was 0 052 g l with a gas flow rate of 13 8 l h using ozonation alone as a wastewater treatment had the ability to diminish the pollutants from the wastewater sample however the removal efficiency was better using the hybrid process compared with ozonation process alone when using ec o3 the removal rate of color turbidity and cod were 98 residual 168 ptco 98 residual 8 ntu and 67 3 residual 700 mg l respectively however when using o3 process alone the removal of color turbidity and cod were 40 8 37 5 and 23 respectively table 3 provides the summary of the ec operational parameters and the results associated with using ec alone and the hybrid system the chemical reactions of ozonation process can be used to explain the advantage of combining the ozonation and electrocoagulation process the activation of the hydroxyl radical mediated mechanism can improve the yield of ozonation due to the iron species present in the wastewater treated using ec process ozonation takes place by direct molecular ozonation oxidation eq 5 or a radical mechanism eqs 6 10 in the radical mechanism iron species produced from ec process acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals improving the generation of hydroxyl radicals and consequently the efficiency of the ozonation process 88 5 o3 2h 2e o2 h2o 6 o3 h2o 2ho o2 7 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 8 o 3 h o o 2 h o 2 2 o 2 h 9 o 3 h o 2 2 o 2 h o 10 2 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 3 2 2 peroxi electrocoagulation ec h2o2 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are environmentally friendly emerging methods for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with toxic and persistent pollutants 89 90 the addition of eaop has the ability to prevent and remediate pollution issues caused by the clean electron reagent 91 however some drawbacks of the eaops have been identified including the production of chemical sludge high acid consumption for decreasing the ph and high concentrations of chloride and sulfate ions in the treated wastewater sample 63 asaithambi et al 2016 conducted a study concerning the oxidation process induced by electrochemistry for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent 93 the lab scale electrocoagulation hybrid system consisted of 2 iron plates spaced 3 cm apart from one another and connected to a power supply with two additional iron plates placed between the anode and cathode for further removal of pollutants all electrodes were connected in a bipolar series mode bp s as shown in fig 12 the effect of the current density initial ph value and h2o2 concentration on pollutant removal efficiencies was observed h2o2 was added into the solution before starting the ec process which resulted in increase of cod removal by 13 whereas the removal of ec alone was 72 and energy consumption was decreased by 15 optimum run was achieved by using a current density of 1 3 ma cm2 initial ph of 7 h2o2 concentration of 234 mg l a reaction time of 240 min stirring speed of 100 rpm and ac power supply overall the addition of h2o2 resulted in a total cod removal of 85 residual 12 000 mg l and color removal of 100 with energy consumption of 1 2 kw h m3 farhadi et al 2012 investigated the efficiency of using peroxi electrocoagulation system for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 94 the removal efficiency of cod after ec alone was 34 2 using dc power supply 1 7 1 9 ma cm2 current density 60 min electrolysis time 4 iron electrodes 2 5 cm electrodes spacing and initial ph value of 7 at the optimal condition the energy consumption for ec was 65 06 kw h kg cod when adding 300 mg l of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the removal efficiency of cod increased to 57 7 moreover the energy consumption was decreased by 50 6 32 14 kw h kg cod residual 205 mg l vasudevan 2014 obtained a removal efficiency of 92 of phenol residual 0 2 mg l from synthetic wastewater in a pilot scale peroxi ec process 95 in the peroxi ec process mild steel was used as anode and graphite as cathode the highest removal efficiency was reached using initial phenol concentration of 2 5 mg l by supplying 1 ma cm2 dc power ph was maintained at 2 total of 10 was used as anode and cathode and the distance between them was 0 4 cm yuksel et al 2009 studied the efficiency of using peroxi electrocoagulation process for the treatment of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds surfactant wastewater 96 at initial concentration of 60 mg l of sds the removal efficiency was 81 6 residual 11 04 mg l it was obtained using dc power supply with current density 0 5 ma cm2 ph value of 5 electrolysis time of 10 min 4 iron electrodes separated by 2 5 cm and arranged in bp s mode at those operational parameters the mean energy consumption was 1 63 kw h kg sds yazdanbakhsh et al 2015 have got similar results for the removal of azithromycin cod from synthetic wastewater using peroxi electrocoagulation 97 at initial concentration of 190 mg l of cod the removal efficiency was 95 6 residual 8 4 mg l the operational parameters used were 20 0 5 ma cm2 dc power supply 68 mg l of hydrogen peroxide concentration 60 min of electrolysis time ph of 3 200 rpm of stirring speed 4 iron electrodes placed 2 cm apart and arranged in mp p mode the energy consumption associated with those operational parameters was 2 5 kw h kg azithromycin table 3 summarizes the operational parameters used in the ec process and the results achieved by ec and peroxi electrocoagulation the use of peroxi electrocoagulation system has displayed efficient and effective decolorization and degradation of the wastewater sample as compared to when the systems were used separately 93 moreover the energy consumption and removal efficiency of the ec were enhanced when using peroxi electrocoagulation in comparison with using ec alone the chemical reactions of the oxidation process can be used to explain the advantage of using peroxi electrocoagulation process as shown in eq 11 the oxidation process depends on the availability of hydrogen peroxide and a source of ferrous in the peroxi electrocoagulation process h2o2 is externally applied while a sacrificial fe anode is used as fe2 source moreover fe2 may be continuously regenerated due to the reduction of

are sometimes inadequate for treating tertiary treated wastewater especially when pollutants are transferred to another phase typically in sludge or brine 85 to effectively treat those types of wastewaters advanced oxidation reduction processes ao rps are some of the better solutions utilized water treatment using ultraviolet is a process that boosts pollutants oxidation or reduction through multilateral mechanisms 100 this process has high removal rate for microorganisms only therefore electrocoagulation process can be used as a pretreatment process for the removal of turbidity and suspended particles moradi et al 2018 conducted experiments using ec with ultraviolet uvc to treat tertiary treated wastewater to enhance the removal efficiency of cod cr and sulfide 101 the electrocoagulation process was used as a pretreatment prior to uvc using 2 aluminum electrodes placed 1 cm apart and connected to a dc power source as seen in fig 13 the initial ph value of the feed wastewater was 11 41 it was found that iron electrodes were not suitable for this hybrid system due to the formation of ferrous sulfide flocs which led to effluent turbid appearance the optimum applied current was 500 ma and the electrolysis time was 20 min in the ec process the removal efficiency of turbidity was 99 9 soluble cod was 50 3 suspended cod was 99 9 total dissolved solids tds was 62 4 total suspended solids tss was 99 9 sulfide was 21 5 cr t was 39 8 and cr vi was 35 4 the treated water was then placed in a uvc vuv system for further treatment the uvc vuv process has a tubular pyrex with a path length of 350 mm and a uv lamp with output of 5 7 w uvc the lamp emissions has wavelength of 185 nm and running time of 40 min the removal rate of cr vi was 100 cr t was 100 total dissolved solids was 93 3 residual 612 mg l soluble cod was 98 3 residual 96 9 mg l suspended cod was 99 9 residual 1 02 mg l turbidity was 99 9 residual 0 1 ntu and sulfide was 97 8 residual 1 14 mg l while using the hybrid ec uvc vuv process the advanced oxidation of oxidizable inorganic s2 and organic cod contents increased and the amount of cr vi decreased it was found that hybrid ec uvc vuv can enhance the removal of the pollutants from tertiary treated wastewater table 3 summarizes the operational parameters and results of ec and uvc vuv 3 2 4 electrocoagulation electrooxidation ec eo electrooxidation is a system that is effective in removing organic compounds through oxidation 40 102 103 in the direct electrooxidation system pollutants in the bulk of the wastewater must reach the electrode surface and the oxidation reaction takes place once they are adsorbed onto the surface however its high time consumption in operational time limits its practicality especially when colloidal particles are present to minimize the time consumption electrocoagulation system is used to reduce operation time and eliminate the colloidal particles and charged species the ec system quickly coagulates and removes the colloidal and suspended particles allowing the eo system to remove the remaining organic pollutants 104 hernandez et al 2010 examined the advantages of using an ec system with electrooxidation for treatment of industrial wastewater 104 the research used ec as a pretreatment process with 2 iron electrodes connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 14 using the ec system alone the removal efficiency of cod was 85 6 bod5 was 46 4 total coliform was 99 color was 52 2 and turbidity was 83 8 at current density of 80 ma cm2 generated from a dc power supply after operational time of 30 min when the initial ph value was between 7 and 8 the eo consists of an iron electrode at the cathode and boron doped diamond bdd electrode at the anode both connected to a dc power supply through analysis the best operating parameters were found to be 80 ma cm2 with an initial ph value of 8 and 90 min of electrolysis time cod reached full removal after 90 min of electrolysis time decreasing the time more than 10 0 of the time required to reach full removal of cod with electrooxidation alone when the hybrid system was used the removal efficiencies were more than 99 residual 1 mg l of cod bod5 and total coliform and 100 of color and turbidity in the coupled system electrocoagulation could quickly coagulate and remove colloidal and suspended particles while electro oxidation oxidizes the remaining organics the summary of the operational parameters and results of ec and eo are shown in table 3 3 3 hybrid electrocoagulation adsorption processes adsorption process is widely used for desalination and wastewater treatment this is due to its simple application and high removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand odor and color the main drawbacks of using adsorption process are rapid saturation and clogging of the reactors expensive regeneration procedures and low removal efficiency for hardness and heavy metals therefore utilizing ec as a pretreatment process for the adsorption process can eliminate the suspended solids which reduce the clogging of the reactor also the ec process has high removal efficiency for hardness and heavy metals that will enhance the final water quality 3 3 1 electrocoagulation activated carbon adsorption ec ad activated carbon ac is widely used as adsorbent due to its high surface area and well developed porous structure 105 the advantages of activated carbon are high adsorption rate of organic and inorganic pollutants dissolved in wastewater and the ability to diffuse dissolved species into the pores of adsorbent 106 ec can be combined with ac to increase the removal of organic pollutants form wastewater myllymäki et al 2018 studied the feasibility of combining the electrocoagulation with activated carbon adsorption for the removal of total organic carbon toc from peat solution 107 different processes arrangement was studied including ec ac and ac ec in the ec system iron or aluminum electrode was used as anode and stainless steel electrode was used as cathode they were spaced 0 5 cm apart and connected to a dc power source with a current density of 8 ma cm2 and experimental time of 60 min fig 15 while using iron and aluminum electrodes as anode the toc removal rate was 86 7 and 79 7 respectively in the activated carbon adsorption system the activated carbon consisted of 82 mesopores and 92 carbon the maximum toc removal in the activated carbon process was 89 9 using activated carbon concentration of 10 g l the toc removal rate increased to 94 4 using hybrid ec ac process with aluminum electrodes however the toc removal using hybrid ec ac decreased to 73 3 using iron electrodes and 93 3 using aluminum electrodes in the case of using adsorption after fe ec a negative removal was noticed this opposite behavior must be further studied for the purpose of obtaining a better understanding of the relationship between ec and ac in general ac ec was found to be efficient hybrid system for the removal of organic matter from the wastewater table 4 summarizes the operational parameters and results of ec and ac processes 3 3 2 electrocoagulation biofiltration ec bf biofiltration is traditionally used for the treatment of landfill leachate due to their simplicity low treatment cost and high performance for the removal of biodegradable organic materials and nitrogen the system is based on bacteria that are immobilized on a media that provides the bacteria with a high surface area to capture and biologically degrade pollutants from wastewater 108 dia et al 2018 studied the impact of using ec process as a pretreatment for biofiltration bf on the treatment of landfill leachates 43 the efficiency of merging these two different treatments was measured by analyzing the removal rates of cod phosphorous nh4 and metals in the ec system a hollow cylindrical rod made of stainless steel was used as the cathode and fully cylindrical rod made purely of aluminum was used as the anode and placed at a spacing of 1 55 cm and connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 16 the highest cod removal was 82 obtained at an initial ph of 7 83 current density of 8 ma cm2 and a treatment time of 20 min for the biofiltration process to take place an aerated column was used with a mixture of wood and peat chips aeration is an operational sludge processor that works by pumping air into the tank promoting microbial growth in the wastewater the microbes then feed on the organic matter allowing the formation of flocs which settle at the bottom of the container 109 treating landfill leachate using the ec technology as a pretreatment has increased the removal rates of cod by 37 toc by 15 color by 60 turbidity by 82 phosphorus by 82 iron by 95 and zinc by 95 the ec technology was found to be not efficient for the removal of ammonia since the removal rate was 6 only while using the hybrid system removal rate for cod was 63 2 residual 595 mg l bod5 was 97 residual 5 mg l and tochyl was 49 residual 165 mg l th removal rate of inorganic pollutants and metals were more than 99 the removal rate of turbidity color zinc phosphorous iron and aluminum were 95 5 residual 8 1 ntu 47 5 residual 851 tcu 69 9 residual 0 44 mg l 78 9 residual 1 03 mg l 96 5 residual 0 87 mg l and 39 residual 0 39 mg l respectively the overall cost of running the hybrid process was 1 23 us m3 approximately oumar et al 2016 have studied the performance of hybrid biofiltration electrocoagulation for the treatment of sanitary landfill leachate in the biofiltration system pvc column with mixtures of wood and peat was used 110 the air flow rate was set to 5 l min for a filtration period of 240 days the feasibility of using biofiltration as a pre treatment showed promising results in terms of removal of bod5 ammonia phosphorous and turbidity with percentages reaching 94 residual 4 2 mg l 94 residual 20 5 mg l 98 residual 0 05 mg l and 95 residual 5 35 ntu respectively the cod removal rate was exceptionally low with an average of 13 after using electrocoagulation as a post treatment process with cylindrical magnesium based anode and hollow cylindrical stainless steel cathode the removal of residual cod reduced to 53 total removal from feed 59 1 residual 313 mg l and the color by 85 when the current density was 10 ma cm2 for a period of 30 min overall the hybrid ec bf process is an economical solution used for treatment of landfill leachates 43 the complimentary nature of the two processes enhances the removal efficiency of a wide range of pollutants while more research is required to limit the electrodes fouling caused by raw landfill leachate 43 table 4 summarizes the operational parameters and the results for studies done on ec bf process 4 scaling up hybrid processes it is important to design a scalable hybrid ec bench scale process to implement the technology at an industrial scale 111 although hybrid electrocoagulation based processes have showed promising pollutant removal efficiency and low energy consumption few studies were conducted at a pilot scale four studies evaluated the performance of ec hybrid systems for treatment of municipal wastewater two for treatment of food processing industry wastewater and one for pretreatment of seawater timmes et al 2010 treated seawater using a hybrid ec uf process 112 the combined volume of the ec uf process was 56 68 l ec was used to pretreat seawater and this pretreatment reduced fouling by in uf stage in ec iron electrodes were used and the polarity of the electrodes were changed after 250 s which resulted in constant iron dosing due to enhanced scouring of hydrogen at cathode the average iron dosing from the ec process was 0 73 mg l when similar dose of fecl3 was administered transmembrane pressure in uf reduced by 20 through x ray diffraction it was found that magnetite maghemite lepidocrocite and akageneite deposited on the electrodes the deposition of these precipitates on the electrodes were attributed to inefficient hydraulic design of the ec unit it was recommended that ec units be built with short retention time and higher current density be used in the process to increase scouring velocity which will prevent deposition of precipitates on the electrodes moreover usage of longer cycling time for polarity reversal was also recommended ibeid et al 2013 developed the first electro bioreactor based pilot plant for treatment of municipal wastewater 81 the total volume of the reactor was 250 l and hollow fiber pvdf membrane module was used for filtration for ec two cylindrical electrodes were used connected to dc current the current density was maintained at 15 a cm2 and pulsed voltage was applied at 5 min on and 20 min off mode the average inlet mlss concentration was 3000 mg l and the hydraulic retention time in the reactor was 11 h it was found that combining ec with mbr reduced membrane fouling by 300 in mbr soluble microbial products smp and organic colloids are mainly responsible for membrane fouling by using ec smp and organic colloids were removed which led to reduction of membrane fouling moreover the dc electric field changed the structure and morphology of the suspended solids which enhanced electroosmotic extraction of tightly bound water from suspended solids daghrir et al 2013 undertook a pilot study that combined ec with eo for treatment of domestic wastewater 113 the reactor consisted of 3 fe or al electrode and four graphite electrode and had a total volume of 1 7 l only the graphite electrodes were connected to a dc power supply the fe or al electrodes were operated as bipolar sacrificial electrode whish were polarized by ions in the solution in the solution electrolysis produced cl2 hclo and clo which acted as oxidizing agent whenever the conductivity of the inlet was low nacl was added to enhance production of oxidant chloride during operation production of cl and fe al was recorded to be 9 6 gm l and 20 60 g m l respectively by applying 0 7 a current 79 reduction in cod was achieved at specific cost of us 0 78 m3 nguyen et al 2014 studied a rotating hanging media bioreactor hrmbr for treating organic pollutants and nutrients from municipal wastewater 114 in the pilot plant hrmbr was followed by mbr and ec units the mlss concentration in the hrmbr and mbr was 4155 7810 mg l and 4565 8690 mg l respectively the hrmbr is responsible for denitrification partial phosphorus removal and enhancement of contact between nutrient and biomass the primary function of the mbr was to maintain high mlss density under aerated condition the effluent to the mbr was taken to an ec tank where 10 v dc voltage was applied and the tank had a hydraulic retention time of 2 min during the 16 month operation a remove of 100 total phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen was achieved the bod and cod of the effluent were also very low during the study it was found that nutrient concentration in the effluent can be controlled by controlling the internal cycling ratio hasan et al 2014 investigated the performance of a pilot scale submerged membrane zelectro bioreactor smebr for treating municipal wastewater 115 the smebr used electric field and microfiltration in an activated sludge media for removing nutrients from the wastewater the tank consisted of a micro filtration membrane in the middle surrounded by cylindrical electrodes dc power was supplied to the electrode and compressed air was introduced from the bottom of the reactor the air ensured complete sludge mixing supplied adequate oxygen and reduced fouling of the membrane 116 de gritted and screened municipal wastewater entered the biological treatment zone at a flowrate of 0 6 m3 day and passed on to electrical zone finally it was filtered out from the middle the hydraulic retention time of the tank was 11 h for ec pulsed dc was supplied at 12 a m2 on a 5 min on and 10 min off basis after the treatment process ammonium nitration total phosphorus and cod reduced by 99 99 and 92 respectively it was concluded that smebr was better than mbr in terms of pollutant removal efficiency and economics 5 concluding remarks and prespectives during the last years there is an increasing attention about using hybrid electrocoagulation process for water treatment applications it was found that using hybrid ec process could enhance the removal of pollutants and reduce the overall cost of the process this paper evaluates the efficiency of integrating ec process with other water treatment processes including membranes chemical electromagnetic and oxidation processes it was concluded that using ec as pretreatment process has several advantages including increase of permeate water volume enhance permeate water quality mitigate membrane fouling and reduce the overall operational cost of the hybrid process there are still some challenges to be solved before commercialization the hybrid ec processes further studies must be done on reduction of electrode consumption and improving the removal efficiency of the process this could be done by investigating the performance of dielectrophilic enhanced electrodes that is expected to reduce the electrode consumption and improve the permeate water quality pilot scale studies have been undertaken for ec uf ec mbr and ec eo only focused on municipal wastewater more pilot scale studies are required for other ec based hybrid process that must be tested on different types of wastewater including industrial wastewater a long term energy evaluation must be done to evaluate the energy efficiency of various hybrid ec processes it is highly recommended to conduct the studies at pilot

13649,electrocoagulation ec has attracted attention during the recent years due to its ease of use and high removal rate of organic and inorganic pollutants it was found that using ec as a pretreatment process can decrease the overall energy consumption and improve the treated water quality this literature review evaluates the efficiency of integrating ec process with other water treatment processes including membranes chemical electromagnetic and oxidation processes the studied technologies were ultrafiltration ec uf reverse osmosis ec ro forward osmosis ec fo membrane distillation ec md forward osmosis membrane distillation ec fo md membrane bioreactor ec mbr electrodialysis ec ed ozonation ec o3 ultraviolet ec uvc vuv peroxi electrocoagulation ec h2o2 activated carbon adsorption ec ac biofiltration ec bf and electro oxidation ec eo the overall performance was evaluated using pollutants removal efficiency energy consumption and operational cost then the performance of pilot scale hybrid electrocoagulation processes and the current status of implementation was discussed the future potential of electrocoagulation lies with proper hybridization of ec with other water treatment processes that would minimize the overall cost and enhance quality of the treated water keywords electrocoagulation hybrid processes water wastewater wastewater treatment 1 introduction water sacristy is one of the most challenging problems of the current century 2 billion people do not have convenient access to potable water 1 due to inadequate water and sanitation an average of 780 000 people died annually 2 moreover around 55 million people are affected by drought causing more than us 5 billion of economic damage the use of water is increasing by 1 every year since 1980 and it is estimated to continue until 2050 water demand is generated by several sectors including residential agricultural and industrial sector wastewater treatment could be a solution for the water scarcity problem the conventional wastewater treatment contains three main stages namely primary treatment secondary treatment and tertiary treatment tertiary treatment is important because it generates water suitable for various industrial agriculture and residential applications in the tertiary treatment it was found that membrane filtration has many disadvantages such as high energy consumption and membrane fouling in this context focus is set on hybridization of electrocoagulation ec process which would make it suitable for the treatment of water and wastewater sustainable water desalination and water reuse by using its intrinsic ability of removing organic and inorganic pollutants hybrid electrocoagulation processes has attracted more research attention during the last decade fig 1 ec process is capable of removing multiple types of pollutants including total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod heavy metals total suspended solids oil emulsions turbidity and color from water and wastewater 3 7 ec was found to be highly efficient pre treatment process compared with chemical coagulation and flocculation considering the removal rate of pollutants and ease of use 8 10 the hybridization of ec process with other treatment technologies must be selected properly to enhance the removal efficiency and reduce energy consumption this paper evaluates the efficiency of pairing ec with other treatment processes namely ultrafiltration ec uf reverse osmosis ec ro forward osmosis ec fo membrane distillation ec md forward osmosis membrane distillation ec fo md membrane bioreactor ec mbr electrodialysis ec ed ozonation ec o3 ultraviolet ec uvc vuv peroxi electrocoagulation ec h2o2 activated carbon adsorption ec ac biofiltration ec bf and electro oxidation ec eo in this review paper these hybrid systems will be thoroughly discussed with emphasis on the enhancements limitation and future aspects with a focus on water treatment and energy efficiency enhancement to the authors knowledge there is no reported review paper on ec hybrid systems 2 electrocoagulation process electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical process used for the treatment of water and wastewater ec is an environmentally friendly process because it generates low amount of sludge and does not require the addition of chemicals in the electrochemical process the current is applied to dissolve the metal from sacrificial anodes immersed in the polluted water the applied current also destabilized the contaminants into charged particles that are neutralized with the ions of opposite electrical charges supplied by the ec process later the agglomerated particles precipitate in a stable form overall the mechanisms that occur during the ec process are mentioned below 11 14 a generation of metal ions by anodes dissolution eq 1 oxidation of water at anode eq 2 and production of hydrogen gas at the cathode eq 3 the overall reaction for the production of iron hydroxides is shown in eq 4 anode 1 fe s fe2 aq 2e 2 2h2o o2 g 4h 4e cathode 3 2h2o aq 2e h2 g oh overall 4 4fe s 10h2o l o2 aq 4fe oh 3 s 4h2 g b neutralization of surface charge of pollutants suspended particulate matter and emulsions c agglomeration of neutralized particles and its coagulation in the aqueous phase as flocs d precipitation or flotation of the coagulated contaminants by sedimentation and evolved h2 as shown in fig 2 e electrochemical and chemical reactions increasing the cathodic reduction of metal ions and organic contaminants at the cathode surface the generation of coagulants is affected by multiple factors including electrodes material electrodes arrangement electrolysis time electrodes spacing current density initial ph and wastewater content it was found that optimum operational parameters depend on the type of wastewater many studies have discussed the effect of the operational parameters on the ec process thus this review will only present a summary of their impact on the overall efficiency of the process even though the used electrodes material does not contribute in the energy consumption calculations proper electrodes material can enhance the energy consumption and increase the removal efficiency 15 moreover electrodes arrangement has a significant role in enhancing the ec efficiency as reported in many studies 16 24 electrodes arrangement are divided into three types monopolar parallel mp p monopolar series mp s and bipolar series bp s in mp p connection arrangement all anodes are connected with each other and the power supply forming parallel connection with current divided among the electrodes however in mp s the internal electrodes anodes and cathodes are connected with each other while not connected with neither outer electrodes nor power supply forming series connection with current equal to the applied one in bp p connection arrangement all inner electrodes are separated from each other and the power supply different polarity is being introduced on each face of the inner electrodes that depends on the adjacent electrode polarity forming series connection as shown in fig 3 c experimental studies have concluded that as the electrolysis time increased the removal efficiency increased and the energy consumption increased the coexistence of different pollutants can effect the removal efficiency of the targeted contaminant in which the concentration of a specific pollutant can play an inhibitory role in the contaminant removal 25 27 as the electrodes spacing decreased the removal efficiency increased without affecting the energy consumption the initial ph value has an influence on the formation of the hydroxide species the optimum ph value depends on the type of pollutants although increasing the current density enhances the removal efficiency 28 34 the formed flocs might get destroyed at extremely high current 35 to maximize the ec efficiency in terms of the pollutants removal and energy consumption the operating parameters must be studied together 6 ec has gained increasing attention over the past years due to its ease of use high removal efficiency and small amount of sludge 36 37 therefore utilizing ec as a pre treatment process could be an economical solution to remove various pollutants efficiently compared with conventional coagulation 38 while comparing ec and conventional coagulation ec was found to be a valuable replacement to the traditional treatment methods due to the advantages mentioned in table 1 as for the impact of the disadvantages stated in table 1 it can be reduced by the other process in the hybrid system using ec hybrid systems can certainly reduce the need to operate the ec for long time thus reducing the electrodes and energy consumption in recent studies the dielectrophoretic dep force was used to enhance the performance of the ec process dep force enhanced ec process was achieved using novel electrodes arrangement dep enhanced ec process was tested for the treatment of municipal wastewater it was found that using the new electrodes configuration increased the removal efficiency of total phosphorus and cod by 24 and 18 respectively 44 also the electrode corrosion decreased by 87 the same team investigated the effect of using dep enhanced ec process on harvesting of marine macroalgae 45 the main goal of the study was to separate algae from seawater with the minimum concentration of aluminum in the separated algae as the collected algae was to be used in further applications it was found that the aluminum content in the harvested biomass decreased by 52 compared to the conventional ec process another study investigated the performance of dep enhanced ec process on the removal of total organic carbon toc from municipal wastewater 46 it was found that the toc removal increased by 7 2 using dep enhanced ec process compared to conventional ec process in addition the electrodes and energy consumption were 27 3 and 6 respectively less when using dep enhanced ec process at an applied current of 800 ma and 30 min of electrolysis time the studies of inducing dep force into the ec system have managed to efficiently enhance the overall performance of the ec process however the dep enhanced ec has not been used in a hybrid system yet 3 hybrid systems using ec and other methods 3 1 hybrid electrocoagulation membrane processes membrane filtration is one of the most commonly used technologies for desalination and wastewater treatment due to the high recovery rate small space requirement and minimal sludge volume there are different types of membranes including ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo membrane distillation md membrane bioreactor mbr and electrodialysis ed membrane separation processes have high recovery rate depending on the membrane type and feed water quality the main drawbacks of these membrane technologies are membrane fouling and high cost of the membranes membrane fouling can be categorized into organic fouling biofouling and inorganic fouling electrocoagulation can be used as a pretreatment process to remove suspended solids colloids turbidity oil proteins humic acids bacteria and heavy metals therefore using electrocoagulation as pretreatment process could reduce membrane fouling and extend the membrane lifecycle 3 1 1 electrocoagulation ultrafiltration ec uf ultrafiltration is a low pressure and cost effective membrane treatment process it is a membrane filtration process which operates using hydrostatic pressure to force water particles through a semi permeable membrane while suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight were retained 47 however uf process suffers from membrane fouling causing a huge drop in the efficiency of the water recovery due to accumulation of particles on the membrane surface and across the membrane pores 48 49 suspended solids and organic pollutants are considered the main foulants in the uf membrane process therefore the removal of suspended solids and organic pollutants using electrocoagulation could be a suitable mitigation method for membrane fouling 50 also the final water quality obtained using the uf process could be enhanced due to the lower amount of pollutants available in the feed water sardari et al 50 conducted a research where 5 aluminum electrodes were placed in the ec process 0 9 cm apart from one another arranged in bp s mode with a dc power supply and current density of 3 ma cm2 fig 4 the poultry processing water ppw was pretreated using the ec process prior to the ultrafiltration process for 5 min the removal efficiency was 87 for bod 59 for cod 94 for fog and 84 for tss with an energy consumption of 0 15 kw h m3 removal of these pollutants led to a higher initial permeate flux and a lower flux decline during the ultrafiltration process in the ultrafiltration process regenerated cellulose rc membrane was used at a flow rate of 1 2 l min and an applied pressure of 70 kpa the initial flux was found to be approximately 97 l m2h and dropped to 55 l m2h reduction of 43 at 500 ml of permeate volume moreover the removal efficiencies were 87 for bod 82 for cod 95 for tss 95 for fog and 55 for protein when uf was used individually the hybrid ec uf process resulted in a higher quality permeate where the removal rate of tss and fog were 100 cod was 92 residual 70 mg l bod was 98 residual 40 mg l and protein was 90 residual 45 mg l during the short term analysis of the uf process when using ec as pretreatment the water flux reduced from 102 l m2h to 91 l m2h reduction of 10 8 at 500 ml of permeate volume long term analysis was conducted to further investigate the advantages of using the ec system as a pretreatment process before ultrafiltration process in the hybrid process the initial flux was 106 l m2h and dropped to 46 l m2h in the first day of experiment and 22 l m2h after seven days the water flux reached to 0 l m2h after three days of operation using ultrafiltration alone in the hybrid process the initial water flux was retrieved by washing the membrane with fresh water for more than 6 running cycles a summary of the experiments is provided in table 2 3 1 2 electrocoagulation reverse osmosis ec ro reverse osmosis ro is a usually combined with other treatment processes to maximize the treatment efficiency and reduce the membrane fouling issues 51 52 ro suffers from membrane fouling including biofouling and organic fouling 53 54 organic fouling is caused by the accumulation of oil proteins humic acids polysaccharides and lipids on the ro membrane surface 55 biofouling is caused by the adhesion and accumulation of bacteria fungi and yeast 55 ec process can be used as a pretreatment process for ro to remove such pollutants researchers have recently started to investigate the applicability of using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process for ro it was found that ec can be an appropriate pretreatment process for ro since it can reduce the amount of organic matter that causes organic membrane fouling and biofouling 56 57 hakizimana et al 2015 investigated the influence of using ec as a pretreatment process prior to ro for the desalination of sea water 58 the main parameters that were studied in ec process are the initial ph current density stirring speed and electrodes spacing using two aluminum electrodes and dc power supply ec performance was measured based on the removal rates of organic matters like dissolved organic carbon doc and absorbance the removal efficiency increased as the ph and electrodes spacing decreased at current density of 5 6 ma cm2 the optimum ec parameters were found to be 90 rpm stirring speed ph of 4 electrode spacing of 1 cm and running time of 30 min the energy consumption was 0 17 kw h m3 while the removal efficiencies were 57 5 for doc residual 0 57 mg l 81 for absorbance residual 0 37 m 1 and 10 for hardness residual 6008 mg l as per the achieved results it was found that the removal rate of aromatic compounds was higher than aliphatic compounds moreover due to the lower removal efficiency of hardness ec was found to be weak in the removal of scaling ions zhao et al 59 illustrated the advantages of using ec before ro to reduce membrane fouling from the treatment of produced water three iron anodes and three graphite cathodes were used in the ec process with a total number of 6 electrodes electrode spacing of 1 5 cm was used and were connected in mp p mode as shown in fig 5 the ec parameters that were investigated in this study were residence time current density and initial ph value ec effectiveness was evaluated by analyzing the removal rates of cod turbidity and hardness by preliminary analysis it was concluded that the optimum operating conditions are operational time of 30 min current density of 5 9 ma cm2 and an initial ph of 7 36 the ec system achieved a cod turbidity and hardness removal rates of 66 64 93 8 and 85 81 respectively treated water was pumped to the ro process at a flow rate of 0 8 l min and 2 mpa pressure was applied a comparison was made between raw water sample and pretreated water sample it was noted that a sudden decline occurred in the water flux while using raw water after 60 min due to the excess amount of organics and scaling compounds in the feed water after 90 min the water flux dropped to 4 l m2h and 26 l m2h using raw water and pretreated water respectively the permeate flux dropped to 22 l m2 h after 200 min using pretreated feed water therefore after using ec as pretreatment process prior to ro the allowable filtration period increased by 55 additionally the removal efficiency of cod oil turbidity conductivity and hardness was 95 7 residual 12 mg l 99 9 residual 0 86 mg l 99 1 residual 1 26 ntu 81 5 556 μs cm and 99 5 residual 1 37 mg l using ec ro results have proven that using ec as a pretreatment process before using ro for treating produced water enhanced the ro process and produced better water quality den and wang et al 2008 have stated similar conclusion for the treatment of brackish water using hybrid ec ro process 60 the ec process consisted of 5 aluminum electrodes connected in bipolar series bp s mode at optimum conditions the applied current was 3 47 ma cm2 generated using a dc power supply and 30 min electrolysis time the highest removal efficiency of silica achieved was 80 residual 39 mg l the constant pressure and flow rate used in the ro process were 0 5 mpa and 0 8 l min respectively da silva et al 61 have done experiments on the treatment of oily wastewater using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process followed by ro process they have studied the effect of using dc ac power source with various current density electrode type aluminum or iron and operational time 4 pairs of electrodes were used with an electrode spacing of 1 cm arranged in a monopolar series mp s mode as shown in fig 5 the results obtained from the variable runs of ec confirmed that using aluminum electrodes had a larger removal rates than iron electrodes and ac power supply has almost half the electrode consumption compared to dc power supply while using current density of 1 85 ma cm2 and operational time of 6 min the removal efficiency was of 99 5 for turbidity 97 98 for cod and 99 reduction in absorbance at 400 nm the conductivity increased by 12 due to the secretion of ions in the water the pretreated water was pumped to ro process using applied pressure of 1 3 mpa for 2 h it was concluded that increasing both operating pressure and net driving pressure did not affect the removal efficiency through the ro membrane thus 1 mpa was selected as the optimum applied pressure the removal efficiency of the ro process from raw effluent was 99 5 of aluminum ions residual 0 1 mg l 97 3 of tds residual 35 mg l and 99 1 of conductivity from ro feed residual 23 μs cm alongside the collected data ro has further reduced the turbidity from 3 ntu to 1 ntu 66 7 removal efficiency from ro feed and 99 9 total removal ec ro and a total removal 100 of absorbance at 400 nm and cod the pollutants removal efficiency was not affected by the pressure applied in ro the averaged permeate flux was 18 49 lm 2 h 1 at net driving pressure of 2 874 mpa it was noted that less than 10 of the permeate flux was reduced throughout the experiment similar results were also obtained for the treatment of well water by sadeddin et al 62 they have used 2 stainless steel electrodes connected to a dc power supply at 60 min electrolysis time and applied current of 1 75 a the removal efficiencies of turbidity and tss using ec alone were 98 residual 3 ntu and 99 residual 3 mg l respectively ro was operated for a period of 6 months using the pretreated water as feed water it was concluded that the addition of ec has enhanced the ro system in terms of pressure drop silt density index sdi and water flow the feed water had less than 3 min of sdi which is considered suitable for ro plants concluding remarks were made that the ro process was effective in removing the dissolved particles while the combination of ec ro had greater potential in removing different kinds of pollutants at higher removal efficiency a summary of the operational parameters of ec and ro along with the results achieved are mentioned in table 2 3 1 3 electrocoagulation forward osmosis ec fo forward osmosis fo is a promising membrane process for freshwater production it is considered a low energy membrane process because it operates using natural osmotic pressure gradient low water flux and membrane fouling are considered as the drawback for the fo process 63 64 several studies have been done on using fo for the treatment of oil gas produced water however the performance of this process was negatively affected by the oil content in water the accumulation of oil droplets on the membrane surface caused severe membrane fouling and high concentration polarization 65 therefore using ec as a pretreatment process can reduce the amount of oil content in the feed draw solution which mitigates the membrane fouling and enhances the performance of the fo process al hawli et al 2019 designed and tested a lab scale hybrid ec fo process for the treatment of produced water as shown in fig 6 66 two aluminum plates each with the area of 53 9 cm2 were used as the cathode and anode three different current densities of 10 30 and 60 ma cm2 were applied using direct current dc power supply in the ec process the optimum experimental time and current density were found to be 10 min and 10 ma cm2 the oil and grease o g removal was 97 4 residual 24 7 ppm conductivity removal was 5 6 the tss removal efficiency was 97 1 turbidity removal was 91 6 and the toc removal was 91 3 the energy consumption of the ec was found to be 0 093 kw h m3 in the fo process the ec treated produced water was used as the draw solution treated sewage effluent was used as the feed solution two different orientations were investigated in the fo process fo mode active layer facing feed solution and pro mode active layer facing draw solution and it was operated for 1000 min three different flow rates of 0 8 1 2 and 2 lpm were tested in the fo process the highest water recovery rate of 9 2 was obtained using pro mode at flow rate of 1 2 lpm overall the hybrid system removed a total of 98 residual 18 3 ntu 99 residual 31 2 ppm and 16 3 residual 79 μs cm turbidity tss and conductivity respectively sadari et al 2018 developed a lab scale hybrid ec fo process for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing produced water 67 in the ec process the setup consisted of five aluminum electrodes each with the surface area of 180 cm2 that placed with a spacing of 0 8 cm connected to a dc power supply the current density was maintained at 2 78 ma cm2 with different experimental times of 1 2 and 3 min the tss removal was 96 residual 25 6 mg l the toc removal was 82 residual 27 8 mg l and the turbidity removal was 97 residual 3 51 ntu at an operational time of 2 min the energy consumption of using ec at the optimum condition is 0 35 kw h m3 in the fo process 4 m nacl was used as the draw solution and two feed solutions were tested raw produced water and ec treated produced water the flow rate was 0 8 l min and membrane orientation was in fo mode the water flux while using ec pretreated draw solution was 23 5 higher than the water flux of the raw produced water table 2 summarizes the operating parameters and results obtained using ec process and hybrid ec fo process it can be seen from the previous studies that the utilization of electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process has increased the water flux and enhanced the overall water quality current lab scale studies of ec fo hybrids are being conducted for short experimental times therefore pilot scale studies must be done to evaluate the membrane fouling and water production on a larger scale for longer duration 3 1 4 electrocoagulation membrane distillation ec md membrane distillation md is a separation process where vapor molecules passes through a porous hydrophobic membrane 68 the most common configuration is direct contact membrane distillation dcmd because of its high salt rejection rate the permeate water is of very high quality and is suitable for various applications in addition to membrane fouling 69 70 md suffers from membrane wetting which is defined as the permeation of liquid water through the membrane pores that leads to the deterioration of permeate water quality 71 membrane wetting is usually caused by high level of surfactants or contaminants of low surface tension in the feed water 72 73 electrocoagulation has high removal efficiency for dissolved organic matter surfactants and other pollutants of low surface tension 74 therefore using ec as a pretreatment process can reduce membrane wetting in md which could enhance the performance of the md process sardari et at 2018 studied the performance of hybrid ec md setup for treatment of highly saline hydraulic fracturing produced water hpfw 74 as illustrated in fig 7 the ec system consisted of 5 aluminum electrodes spaced 0 5 cm apart and connected to a dc power supply the effect of applied current on the removal rates was observed keeping the reaction time at 0 5 min and an initial ph of 6 4 the removal rate increased as the current increased the removal efficiency at those parameters while using 16 5 ma cm2 were found to be 96 for turbidity residual 8 1 ntu 91 for tss residual 37 3 mg l and 61 for toc residual 37 8 mg l with energy consumption of 1 41 kw h m3 the treated water was left for 6 h for sedimentation prior to using md process md process consisted of ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene ectfe membrane at a flow velocity of 16 7 cm s the water flux after the collection of 2 45 l of permeate increased from 18 l m2h to 70 l m2h for temperatures of 50 and 70 respectively furthermore at fs temperature of 60 the water flux increased from 24 l m2h to 47 l m2h at flow velocities of 5 5 cm s and 16 7 cm s respectively after the end of collecting 2 45 l of permeate it was found that using ec has enhanced the water flux by almost 50 water recovery had reached up to 57 from the hfpw sample containing 135 g l dissolved solids long term tests were also conducted using a flow velocity of 9 3 cm s at a fs temperature of 60 allowing the water flux to reach a rate of 30 l m2h when left for 434 h the combined processes of the ec and md systems to treat hfpw have shown results that were more promising than when the md system was utilized alone if appropriately designed the ec pretreatment could have a higher chance to mitigate the fouling and wetting issues during the md operations however more research is required to study the hybridization of ec and md processes for the treatment of wastewater as only one study has been done 3 1 5 electrocoagulation forward osmosis membrane distillation ec fo md in md process the membrane prevents the transfer of liquid particles due to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane and gas liquid interface 76 also fo suffers from concentration polarization that reduces the osmotic pressure difference the effect of concentration polarization could be minimized using ec as a pretreatment 77 78 sardari et al 79 evaluated the performance of tri hybrid ec fo md process electrocoagulation was used as pretreatment process as shown in fig 8 the hybrid process is expected to lower fouling tendency and enhance permeate water quality the ec system consisted of an electrolytic cell with five aluminum electrodes connected in a monopolar parallel mp p configuration with a dc power source the applied current density was 2 78 ma cm2 and the operational time was 2 min the removal efficiencies of turbidity tss and toc from ec process used alone were more than 91 0 residual 10 6 ntu 95 residual 13 6 mg l and 72 residual 24 1 mg l respectively the treated water from the ec process was left to age for 6 h then placed in the fo md hybrid system the experimental parameters showed that both the fo and md system flow rates were 0 7 l min and the fo temperature was 25 while the md system had a temperature of 60 the draw solution concentration was the only variable in the fo md system as a conclusion the increase of draw solution concentration allowed the water recovery to increase simultaneously using 2 0 m of sodium chloride as a draw solution provided 76 water recovery for the case where water contained low tds pw1 tds 11 2 g l while the water that contained high tds pw2 tds 57 2 g l allowed the water recovery to be 30 all the parameters used in the system are summarized in table 2 also the results obtained using ec alone and the hybrid system ec fo md are mentioned as a result of using ec a pretreatment process to fo md fouling issue was minimized and a stable performance was achieved 3 1 6 electrocoagulation membrane bioreactor ec mbr membrane bioreactor mbr is a combination of a membrane process like microfiltration and biological wastewater treatment process mbr suffers from membrane fouling including organic fouling biofouling and inorganic fouling inorganic fouling is caused by cations and anions such as ca2 mg2 fe3 al3 so4 2 po4 3 co3 2 and oh 80 as mentioned earlier organic fouling is caused by oil proteins humic acids polysaccharides and lipids and biofouling is caused by bacteria fungi and yeast ec process can be used as a pretreatment process for mbr to mitigate membrane fouling 81 82 al malack et al 2018 investigated the treatment of hypersaline oilfield produced water using hybrid ec mbr process 25 the feed solution used in the experiment was synthetic produced water the ec system was set up using 2 electrodes of either aluminum or stainless steel connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 9 the impact of electrode material current density and electrolysis time was studied and found that as the current density and electrolysis time increased the removal efficiency of cod and turbidity increased the highest removal efficiency was achieved using aluminum electrodes current density of 30 ma cm2 and electrolysis time of 120 min as shown in table 2 the removal rate of cod was 65 and turbidity was 52 during the experiments conducted on the ec process the bioreactor membrane was also subjected to tests using synthetic produced water to determine the optimum conditions of that membrane which was manufactured by zenon environmental systems the optimum permeate flux was found to be 12 l m2h and with the increase of permeate flux the transmembrane pressure simultaneously increases until it reaches the maximum allowable pressure for that membrane ec mbr process started after the acclimatization period of 90 days where volatile mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss reached a value of 5000 mg l further experimentation with three phases were conducted in the ec mbr to account the different concentrations of oil which were 100 150 200 mg l using 100 mg l of oil in the hybrid system showed the removal efficiency of cod to be 97 residual 48 mg l and the o g removal to be 95 residual 5 mg l after an operational period of 60 days cod and o g removal efficiencies were reduced to 91 residual 162 mg l and 80 residual 40 mg l respectively when the oil concentration increased to 200 mg l furthermore it was mentioned that the use of ec as pretreatment to mbr process has minimized the fouling issue bani melhem et al 2012 studied the impact of using ec process with submerged membrane bioreactor smbr for the treatment of grey water 83 the study was made for a duration of 24 days using the hybrid system the results showed that using ec process has reduced the membrane fouling of smbr by 13 pollutants removal efficiencies of cod turbidity and color were almost the same using the hybrid system and smbr alone for instance cod turbidity and color were reduced by 88 9 residual 51 mg l 97 residual 4 1 ftu and 93 7 residual 26 ptco using ec smbr and 86 residual 65 mg l 94 8 residual 6 9 ftu and 91 2 residual 37 ptco using smbr respectively the removal efficiency of phosphorus was 94 3 residual 0 03 mg l and 65 residual 0 18 mg l for ec smbr and smbr respectively smbr achieved 20 higher removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen 77 8 residual 2 5 mg l and 97 4 residual 0 3 mg l for ec smbr and smbr respectively it was suggested that lower amounts of current and electrodes materials such as iron might further enhance the hybrid system removal efficiency the parameters that were used in the ec process are dc power supply with a potential of 12 v 2 aluminum electrodes spaced at 5 8 cm and 15 min of electrolysis time the transmembrane pressure used in both systems was constant with a value of 7 5 kpa the initial fluxes obtained from ec smbr and smbr were 29 l m2h and 27 5 l m2h respectively short term experiment was also conducted for a period of 24 h it was concluded from the short term experiment that ec smbr has improved the membrane filterability by 20 when compared to smbr process 3 1 7 electrocoagulation electrodialysis ec ed electrodialysis ed is an electricity driven membrane process that uses an electrical current instead of pressure to induce ions through the membrane its high selectivity high product recovery ratio and ability to destroy majority of the components in the raw water has made the system a favorable process to treat water however it is sometimes necessary to use one or two more systems to ensure the efficient treatment of wastewater deghles and kurt 2016 investigated the efficiency of combining an electrocoagulation system with the electrodialysis technology in order to remove cod nh3 n cr and color from tannery wastewater 85 as shown in table 2 the ec set up consisted of 5 pairs of electrodes with 0 7 cm space between them in monopolar parallel mpp arrangement and connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 10 the study analyzed the impact of electrodes material aluminum and iron when the initial ph of 6 for aluminum and 7 for the iron electrodes were set current density and electrolysis time were the major variables in the ec process that was taken under observation at optimum run the current density was found to be 14 ma cm2 and electrolysis time 125 min using aluminum electrodes the removal efficiencies were concluded to be 73 for cod 51 for nh3 n 94 for color and 100 for cr with an energy consumption of 6 75 kwh m3 the bipolar membrane electrodialysis was utilized as the post treatment to ec system the potential applied was kept at a constant of 24 v for all experiments while the electrodes were rinsed by using hydrogen chloride with a concentration of 0 01 m the electrodes were platinized titanium in the anode and cathode spaced by 0 05 cm with this hybrid system the energy consumption of electrodialysis for a period of 45 min was 14 kwh m3 at a current density of 190 ma cm2 when aluminum electrodes were used in the ec process as a result of using this hybrid system the removal efficiencies were 98 3 for conductivity residual 0 397 μs cm 92 for cod residual 224 mg l 100 for cr 100 for nh3 n 100 for ammonium and 100 for color the results showed a decrease in all parameters tested thus the coupling of the ec system with the ed technology has improved the removal efficiency of the different pollutants present in the wastewater sample along with significantly reducing the volume of effluent discharged 3 2 hybrid electrocoagulation oxidation processes oxidation process is widely used in the tertiary stage of wastewater treatment process this is due to the high removal efficiency of organic compounds and heavy metals also this process does not introduce harmful substances into the treated water the main drawback of using oxidation process is the low removal efficiency for pollutants with high molecular weight long processing time and high operating cost especially for feed water with high concentration of pollutants which requires high volume of chemical reagents to operate the system therefore utilizing ec as a pretreatment process for the oxidation processes can eliminate various pollutants at lower cost and a shorter time then the oxidation process can be used to further treat the effluent by removing the excess pollutants 3 2 1 electrocoagulation ozonation ec o3 ozonation o3 is an efficient system that uses ozone as a strong oxidant to decompose many pollutants including dyes however pollutants with high molecular weight cannot be removed using ozonation therefore using electrocoagulation as pretreatment could enhance the overall performance bilinska et 2019 evaluated the performance of hybrid ec o3 process for the treatment of saline water with high dye concentration 86 as shown in fig 11 the ec setup contains 11 electrodes of either aluminum or iron connected in bp s mode with a dc supplier to generate around 20 ma cm2 for the aqueous solution and 100 ma cm2 for the wastewater with an initial ph value of 11 82 in the ec process the iron electrodes were found to be better conductors than the aluminum electrodes due to the high ph value in the water which reduced the efficiency of the aluminum electrodes the removal rate for color was 85 after 10 min of electrolysis however the removal rate did not increase as the electrolysis time increased significantly due to the extremely high ph value in the o3 system 0 3 g l of the ozone was contained in a semi batch stirred cell with a volume of 1 l the feeding parameters utilized were co3 5 mg l and qin 20 l h for the rb5 solutions while the wastewater sample had co3 42 mg l and qin 40 l h in the ozonation process the removal rate of color was 90 after 50 min recommendations were made that the use of ec o3 as a two step process to treat industrial wastewater would be more beneficial than using a one step system due to its lower cost it was also noted that the energy consumption was 3 77 kw h m3 for rb5 and 56 29 kw h m3 for the wastewater solution after using ec as pretreatment the ozonation time reduced from 50 min to 10 min thus reducing the ozonation period by 80 and consequently saving 5 times the amount of ozone dose moreover the total color removal rate was 98 ortega et al 2010 conducted a study on using electrocoagulation coupled with ozonation process and found that the hybrid process was suitable for the treatment of industrial wastewater 87 in the ec process a total of 8 iron electrodes were placed at a spacing of 1 5 cm at optimum conditions the current density was 3 ma cm2 ph value was set in the range of 7 9 and ec was operated for 15 min in the ozonation system a tank reactor of 0 5 l volume was used and the production rate of ozone was 0 052 g l with a gas flow rate of 13 8 l h using ozonation alone as a wastewater treatment had the ability to diminish the pollutants from the wastewater sample however the removal efficiency was better using the hybrid process compared with ozonation process alone when using ec o3 the removal rate of color turbidity and cod were 98 residual 168 ptco 98 residual 8 ntu and 67 3 residual 700 mg l respectively however when using o3 process alone the removal of color turbidity and cod were 40 8 37 5 and 23 respectively table 3 provides the summary of the ec operational parameters and the results associated with using ec alone and the hybrid system the chemical reactions of ozonation process can be used to explain the advantage of combining the ozonation and electrocoagulation process the activation of the hydroxyl radical mediated mechanism can improve the yield of ozonation due to the iron species present in the wastewater treated using ec process ozonation takes place by direct molecular ozonation oxidation eq 5 or a radical mechanism eqs 6 10 in the radical mechanism iron species produced from ec process acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals improving the generation of hydroxyl radicals and consequently the efficiency of the ozonation process 88 5 o3 2h 2e o2 h2o 6 o3 h2o 2ho o2 7 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 8 o 3 h o o 2 h o 2 2 o 2 h 9 o 3 h o 2 2 o 2 h o 10 2 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 3 2 2 peroxi electrocoagulation ec h2o2 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are environmentally friendly emerging methods for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with toxic and persistent pollutants 89 90 the addition of eaop has the ability to prevent and remediate pollution issues caused by the clean electron reagent 91 however some drawbacks of the eaops have been identified including the production of chemical sludge high acid consumption for decreasing the ph and high concentrations of chloride and sulfate ions in the treated wastewater sample 63 asaithambi et al 2016 conducted a study concerning the oxidation process induced by electrochemistry for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent 93 the lab scale electrocoagulation hybrid system consisted of 2 iron plates spaced 3 cm apart from one another and connected to a power supply with two additional iron plates placed between the anode and cathode for further removal of pollutants all electrodes were connected in a bipolar series mode bp s as shown in fig 12 the effect of the current density initial ph value and h2o2 concentration on pollutant removal efficiencies was observed h2o2 was added into the solution before starting the ec process which resulted in increase of cod removal by 13 whereas the removal of ec alone was 72 and energy consumption was decreased by 15 optimum run was achieved by using a current density of 1 3 ma cm2 initial ph of 7 h2o2 concentration of 234 mg l a reaction time of 240 min stirring speed of 100 rpm and ac power supply overall the addition of h2o2 resulted in a total cod removal of 85 residual 12 000 mg l and color removal of 100 with energy consumption of 1 2 kw h m3 farhadi et al 2012 investigated the efficiency of using peroxi electrocoagulation system for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 94 the removal efficiency of cod after ec alone was 34 2 using dc power supply 1 7 1 9 ma cm2 current density 60 min electrolysis time 4 iron electrodes 2 5 cm electrodes spacing and initial ph value of 7 at the optimal condition the energy consumption for ec was 65 06 kw h kg cod when adding 300 mg l of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the removal efficiency of cod increased to 57 7 moreover the energy consumption was decreased by 50 6 32 14 kw h kg cod residual 205 mg l vasudevan 2014 obtained a removal efficiency of 92 of phenol residual 0 2 mg l from synthetic wastewater in a pilot scale peroxi ec process 95 in the peroxi ec process mild steel was used as anode and graphite as cathode the highest removal efficiency was reached using initial phenol concentration of 2 5 mg l by supplying 1 ma cm2 dc power ph was maintained at 2 total of 10 was used as anode and cathode and the distance between them was 0 4 cm yuksel et al 2009 studied the efficiency of using peroxi electrocoagulation process for the treatment of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds surfactant wastewater 96 at initial concentration of 60 mg l of sds the removal efficiency was 81 6 residual 11 04 mg l it was obtained using dc power supply with current density 0 5 ma cm2 ph value of 5 electrolysis time of 10 min 4 iron electrodes separated by 2 5 cm and arranged in bp s mode at those operational parameters the mean energy consumption was 1 63 kw h kg sds yazdanbakhsh et al 2015 have got similar results for the removal of azithromycin cod from synthetic wastewater using peroxi electrocoagulation 97 at initial concentration of 190 mg l of cod the removal efficiency was 95 6 residual 8 4 mg l the operational parameters used were 20 0 5 ma cm2 dc power supply 68 mg l of hydrogen peroxide concentration 60 min of electrolysis time ph of 3 200 rpm of stirring speed 4 iron electrodes placed 2 cm apart and arranged in mp p mode the energy consumption associated with those operational parameters was 2 5 kw h kg azithromycin table 3 summarizes the operational parameters used in the ec process and the results achieved by ec and peroxi electrocoagulation the use of peroxi electrocoagulation system has displayed efficient and effective decolorization and degradation of the wastewater sample as compared to when the systems were used separately 93 moreover the energy consumption and removal efficiency of the ec were enhanced when using peroxi electrocoagulation in comparison with using ec alone the chemical reactions of the oxidation process can be used to explain the advantage of using peroxi electrocoagulation process as shown in eq 11 the oxidation process depends on the availability of hydrogen peroxide and a source of ferrous in the peroxi electrocoagulation process h2o2 is externally applied while a sacrificial fe anode is used as fe2 source moreover fe2 may be continuously regenerated due to the reduction of

are sometimes inadequate for treating tertiary treated wastewater especially when pollutants are transferred to another phase typically in sludge or brine 85 to effectively treat those types of wastewaters advanced oxidation reduction processes ao rps are some of the better solutions utilized water treatment using ultraviolet is a process that boosts pollutants oxidation or reduction through multilateral mechanisms 100 this process has high removal rate for microorganisms only therefore electrocoagulation process can be used as a pretreatment process for the removal of turbidity and suspended particles moradi et al 2018 conducted experiments using ec with ultraviolet uvc to treat tertiary treated wastewater to enhance the removal efficiency of cod cr and sulfide 101 the electrocoagulation process was used as a pretreatment prior to uvc using 2 aluminum electrodes placed 1 cm apart and connected to a dc power source as seen in fig 13 the initial ph value of the feed wastewater was 11 41 it was found that iron electrodes were not suitable for this hybrid system due to the formation of ferrous sulfide flocs which led to effluent turbid appearance the optimum applied current was 500 ma and the electrolysis time was 20 min in the ec process the removal efficiency of turbidity was 99 9 soluble cod was 50 3 suspended cod was 99 9 total dissolved solids tds was 62 4 total suspended solids tss was 99 9 sulfide was 21 5 cr t was 39 8 and cr vi was 35 4 the treated water was then placed in a uvc vuv system for further treatment the uvc vuv process has a tubular pyrex with a path length of 350 mm and a uv lamp with output of 5 7 w uvc the lamp emissions has wavelength of 185 nm and running time of 40 min the removal rate of cr vi was 100 cr t was 100 total dissolved solids was 93 3 residual 612 mg l soluble cod was 98 3 residual 96 9 mg l suspended cod was 99 9 residual 1 02 mg l turbidity was 99 9 residual 0 1 ntu and sulfide was 97 8 residual 1 14 mg l while using the hybrid ec uvc vuv process the advanced oxidation of oxidizable inorganic s2 and organic cod contents increased and the amount of cr vi decreased it was found that hybrid ec uvc vuv can enhance the removal of the pollutants from tertiary treated wastewater table 3 summarizes the operational parameters and results of ec and uvc vuv 3 2 4 electrocoagulation electrooxidation ec eo electrooxidation is a system that is effective in removing organic compounds through oxidation 40 102 103 in the direct electrooxidation system pollutants in the bulk of the wastewater must reach the electrode surface and the oxidation reaction takes place once they are adsorbed onto the surface however its high time consumption in operational time limits its practicality especially when colloidal particles are present to minimize the time consumption electrocoagulation system is used to reduce operation time and eliminate the colloidal particles and charged species the ec system quickly coagulates and removes the colloidal and suspended particles allowing the eo system to remove the remaining organic pollutants 104 hernandez et al 2010 examined the advantages of using an ec system with electrooxidation for treatment of industrial wastewater 104 the research used ec as a pretreatment process with 2 iron electrodes connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 14 using the ec system alone the removal efficiency of cod was 85 6 bod5 was 46 4 total coliform was 99 color was 52 2 and turbidity was 83 8 at current density of 80 ma cm2 generated from a dc power supply after operational time of 30 min when the initial ph value was between 7 and 8 the eo consists of an iron electrode at the cathode and boron doped diamond bdd electrode at the anode both connected to a dc power supply through analysis the best operating parameters were found to be 80 ma cm2 with an initial ph value of 8 and 90 min of electrolysis time cod reached full removal after 90 min of electrolysis time decreasing the time more than 10 0 of the time required to reach full removal of cod with electrooxidation alone when the hybrid system was used the removal efficiencies were more than 99 residual 1 mg l of cod bod5 and total coliform and 100 of color and turbidity in the coupled system electrocoagulation could quickly coagulate and remove colloidal and suspended particles while electro oxidation oxidizes the remaining organics the summary of the operational parameters and results of ec and eo are shown in table 3 3 3 hybrid electrocoagulation adsorption processes adsorption process is widely used for desalination and wastewater treatment this is due to its simple application and high removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand odor and color the main drawbacks of using adsorption process are rapid saturation and clogging of the reactors expensive regeneration procedures and low removal efficiency for hardness and heavy metals therefore utilizing ec as a pretreatment process for the adsorption process can eliminate the suspended solids which reduce the clogging of the reactor also the ec process has high removal efficiency for hardness and heavy metals that will enhance the final water quality 3 3 1 electrocoagulation activated carbon adsorption ec ad activated carbon ac is widely used as adsorbent due to its high surface area and well developed porous structure 105 the advantages of activated carbon are high adsorption rate of organic and inorganic pollutants dissolved in wastewater and the ability to diffuse dissolved species into the pores of adsorbent 106 ec can be combined with ac to increase the removal of organic pollutants form wastewater myllymäki et al 2018 studied the feasibility of combining the electrocoagulation with activated carbon adsorption for the removal of total organic carbon toc from peat solution 107 different processes arrangement was studied including ec ac and ac ec in the ec system iron or aluminum electrode was used as anode and stainless steel electrode was used as cathode they were spaced 0 5 cm apart and connected to a dc power source with a current density of 8 ma cm2 and experimental time of 60 min fig 15 while using iron and aluminum electrodes as anode the toc removal rate was 86 7 and 79 7 respectively in the activated carbon adsorption system the activated carbon consisted of 82 mesopores and 92 carbon the maximum toc removal in the activated carbon process was 89 9 using activated carbon concentration of 10 g l the toc removal rate increased to 94 4 using hybrid ec ac process with aluminum electrodes however the toc removal using hybrid ec ac decreased to 73 3 using iron electrodes and 93 3 using aluminum electrodes in the case of using adsorption after fe ec a negative removal was noticed this opposite behavior must be further studied for the purpose of obtaining a better understanding of the relationship between ec and ac in general ac ec was found to be efficient hybrid system for the removal of organic matter from the wastewater table 4 summarizes the operational parameters and results of ec and ac processes 3 3 2 electrocoagulation biofiltration ec bf biofiltration is traditionally used for the treatment of landfill leachate due to their simplicity low treatment cost and high performance for the removal of biodegradable organic materials and nitrogen the system is based on bacteria that are immobilized on a media that provides the bacteria with a high surface area to capture and biologically degrade pollutants from wastewater 108 dia et al 2018 studied the impact of using ec process as a pretreatment for biofiltration bf on the treatment of landfill leachates 43 the efficiency of merging these two different treatments was measured by analyzing the removal rates of cod phosphorous nh4 and metals in the ec system a hollow cylindrical rod made of stainless steel was used as the cathode and fully cylindrical rod made purely of aluminum was used as the anode and placed at a spacing of 1 55 cm and connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 16 the highest cod removal was 82 obtained at an initial ph of 7 83 current density of 8 ma cm2 and a treatment time of 20 min for the biofiltration process to take place an aerated column was used with a mixture of wood and peat chips aeration is an operational sludge processor that works by pumping air into the tank promoting microbial growth in the wastewater the microbes then feed on the organic matter allowing the formation of flocs which settle at the bottom of the container 109 treating landfill leachate using the ec technology as a pretreatment has increased the removal rates of cod by 37 toc by 15 color by 60 turbidity by 82 phosphorus by 82 iron by 95 and zinc by 95 the ec technology was found to be not efficient for the removal of ammonia since the removal rate was 6 only while using the hybrid system removal rate for cod was 63 2 residual 595 mg l bod5 was 97 residual 5 mg l and tochyl was 49 residual 165 mg l th removal rate of inorganic pollutants and metals were more than 99 the removal rate of turbidity color zinc phosphorous iron and aluminum were 95 5 residual 8 1 ntu 47 5 residual 851 tcu 69 9 residual 0 44 mg l 78 9 residual 1 03 mg l 96 5 residual 0 87 mg l and 39 residual 0 39 mg l respectively the overall cost of running the hybrid process was 1 23 us m3 approximately oumar et al 2016 have studied the performance of hybrid biofiltration electrocoagulation for the treatment of sanitary landfill leachate in the biofiltration system pvc column with mixtures of wood and peat was used 110 the air flow rate was set to 5 l min for a filtration period of 240 days the feasibility of using biofiltration as a pre treatment showed promising results in terms of removal of bod5 ammonia phosphorous and turbidity with percentages reaching 94 residual 4 2 mg l 94 residual 20 5 mg l 98 residual 0 05 mg l and 95 residual 5 35 ntu respectively the cod removal rate was exceptionally low with an average of 13 after using electrocoagulation as a post treatment process with cylindrical magnesium based anode and hollow cylindrical stainless steel cathode the removal of residual cod reduced to 53 total removal from feed 59 1 residual 313 mg l and the color by 85 when the current density was 10 ma cm2 for a period of 30 min overall the hybrid ec bf process is an economical solution used for treatment of landfill leachates 43 the complimentary nature of the two processes enhances the removal efficiency of a wide range of pollutants while more research is required to limit the electrodes fouling caused by raw landfill leachate 43 table 4 summarizes the operational parameters and the results for studies done on ec bf process 4 scaling up hybrid processes it is important to design a scalable hybrid ec bench scale process to implement the technology at an industrial scale 111 although hybrid electrocoagulation based processes have showed promising pollutant removal efficiency and low energy consumption few studies were conducted at a pilot scale four studies evaluated the performance of ec hybrid systems for treatment of municipal wastewater two for treatment of food processing industry wastewater and one for pretreatment of seawater timmes et al 2010 treated seawater using a hybrid ec uf process 112 the combined volume of the ec uf process was 56 68 l ec was used to pretreat seawater and this pretreatment reduced fouling by in uf stage in ec iron electrodes were used and the polarity of the electrodes were changed after 250 s which resulted in constant iron dosing due to enhanced scouring of hydrogen at cathode the average iron dosing from the ec process was 0 73 mg l when similar dose of fecl3 was administered transmembrane pressure in uf reduced by 20 through x ray diffraction it was found that magnetite maghemite lepidocrocite and akageneite deposited on the electrodes the deposition of these precipitates on the electrodes were attributed to inefficient hydraulic design of the ec unit it was recommended that ec units be built with short retention time and higher current density be used in the process to increase scouring velocity which will prevent deposition of precipitates on the electrodes moreover usage of longer cycling time for polarity reversal was also recommended ibeid et al 2013 developed the first electro bioreactor based pilot plant for treatment of municipal wastewater 81 the total volume of the reactor was 250 l and hollow fiber pvdf membrane module was used for filtration for ec two cylindrical electrodes were used connected to dc current the current density was maintained at 15 a cm2 and pulsed voltage was applied at 5 min on and 20 min off mode the average inlet mlss concentration was 3000 mg l and the hydraulic retention time in the reactor was 11 h it was found that combining ec with mbr reduced membrane fouling by 300 in mbr soluble microbial products smp and organic colloids are mainly responsible for membrane fouling by using ec smp and organic colloids were removed which led to reduction of membrane fouling moreover the dc electric field changed the structure and morphology of the suspended solids which enhanced electroosmotic extraction of tightly bound water from suspended solids daghrir et al 2013 undertook a pilot study that combined ec with eo for treatment of domestic wastewater 113 the reactor consisted of 3 fe or al electrode and four graphite electrode and had a total volume of 1 7 l only the graphite electrodes were connected to a dc power supply the fe or al electrodes were operated as bipolar sacrificial electrode whish were polarized by ions in the solution in the solution electrolysis produced cl2 hclo and clo which acted as oxidizing agent whenever the conductivity of the inlet was low nacl was added to enhance production of oxidant chloride during operation production of cl and fe al was recorded to be 9 6 gm l and 20 60 g m l respectively by applying 0 7 a current 79 reduction in cod was achieved at specific cost of us 0 78 m3 nguyen et al 2014 studied a rotating hanging media bioreactor hrmbr for treating organic pollutants and nutrients from municipal wastewater 114 in the pilot plant hrmbr was followed by mbr and ec units the mlss concentration in the hrmbr and mbr was 4155 7810 mg l and 4565 8690 mg l respectively the hrmbr is responsible for denitrification partial phosphorus removal and enhancement of contact between nutrient and biomass the primary function of the mbr was to maintain high mlss density under aerated condition the effluent to the mbr was taken to an ec tank where 10 v dc voltage was applied and the tank had a hydraulic retention time of 2 min during the 16 month operation a remove of 100 total phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen was achieved the bod and cod of the effluent were also very low during the study it was found that nutrient concentration in the effluent can be controlled by controlling the internal cycling ratio hasan et al 2014 investigated the performance of a pilot scale submerged membrane zelectro bioreactor smebr for treating municipal wastewater 115 the smebr used electric field and microfiltration in an activated sludge media for removing nutrients from the wastewater the tank consisted of a micro filtration membrane in the middle surrounded by cylindrical electrodes dc power was supplied to the electrode and compressed air was introduced from the bottom of the reactor the air ensured complete sludge mixing supplied adequate oxygen and reduced fouling of the membrane 116 de gritted and screened municipal wastewater entered the biological treatment zone at a flowrate of 0 6 m3 day and passed on to electrical zone finally it was filtered out from the middle the hydraulic retention time of the tank was 11 h for ec pulsed dc was supplied at 12 a m2 on a 5 min on and 10 min off basis after the treatment process ammonium nitration total phosphorus and cod reduced by 99 99 and 92 respectively it was concluded that smebr was better than mbr in terms of pollutant removal efficiency and economics 5 concluding remarks and prespectives during the last years there is an increasing attention about using hybrid electrocoagulation process for water treatment applications it was found that using hybrid ec process could enhance the removal of pollutants and reduce the overall cost of the process this paper evaluates the efficiency of integrating ec process with other water treatment processes including membranes chemical electromagnetic and oxidation processes it was concluded that using ec as pretreatment process has several advantages including increase of permeate water volume enhance permeate water quality mitigate membrane fouling and reduce the overall operational cost of the hybrid process there are still some challenges to be solved before commercialization the hybrid ec processes further studies must be done on reduction of electrode consumption and improving the removal efficiency of the process this could be done by investigating the performance of dielectrophilic enhanced electrodes that is expected to reduce the electrode consumption and improve the permeate water quality pilot scale studies have been undertaken for ec uf ec mbr and ec eo only focused on municipal wastewater more pilot scale studies are required for other ec based hybrid process that must be tested on different types of wastewater including industrial wastewater a long term energy evaluation must be done to evaluate the energy efficiency of various hybrid ec processes it is highly recommended to conduct the studies at pilot scale in continuous flow mode to simulate the commercial scenario more research must be done on developing numerical models to predict the performance of the ec hybrid process this is expected to accelerate the commercialization of the technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
