19695,dewatering of waste activated sludge was is of major interest in its volume reduction transportation and ultimate disposal persulfate based oxidation process is a newly developed option for enhancing was dewaterability through the generation of powerful sulfate radicals so4 however the enhancement in was dewaterability by persulfate differs with the species of iron catalysts used in this study two types of iron catalysts i e fe2 vs fe0 were employed to initiate the persulfate s2o8 2 and the catalyzing behaviors and the underlying principles in enhancing was dewaterability were investigated and compared the fe2 exhibited the high effectiveness in catalyzing the decomposition of persulfate to sulfate radicals so4 inducing the greater improvement in was dewatering the was dewaterability indicated by dry solids content after filtration increased with the added s2o8 2 fe2 dosages with the dry solids content reaching up to 5 1 0 8 wt at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs after only 30 s filtration roughly 1 8 fold increase than raw was 1 8 0 1 wt in contrast the influence of the persulfate oxidation when activated with fe0 on was dewaterability was statistically insignificant the was dewaterability remained nearly unchanged i e dry solids content of 2 0 0 0 wt irrespective of the employed s2o8 2 fe0 dosages further analysis demonstrated that the was dewaterability negatively corresponded to loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the abundant so4 from s2o8 2 fe2 system could effectively disrupt the gel like eps matrix break apart the cells and subsequently arouse the release of the water inside eps and cells facilitating water solid separation in the case of s2o8 2 fe0 the dissolution of fe0 particles was the rate limiting step due to the formation of oxide iron layer near fe0 metallic surface which resulted in the slow so4 production and thus hardly promoted was dewaterability the ph adjustment could accelerate fe0 dissolution and enhance the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process to a certain degree but the effect was unsatisfactory additionally the observations regarding the dissolved organic matters and ammonium collectively revealed that except for enhancing was dewatering s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation could concurrently degrade cod and ammonia from was filtrate lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and reduce operational expense hence from an environmental and economic perspective the s2o8 2 fe2 system possesses much greater promise for was dewatering graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge dewatering persulfate based oxidation process iron catalysts extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction the management of waste activated sludge was accounts for approximately 50 60 of the operating cost of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and has become one of the main concerns appels et al 2008 to reduce the expenses of the subsequent transport and disposal was needs to be dewatered deeply and effectively to date the dewatering of such sludge still poses a huge technical challenge to water industry the water content of was is usually in the range of 95 99 and it is still up to 75 80 even after mechanical dewatering for decades the development of high performance techniques for deep dewatering of was has been being a high research priority in research communities to improve the was dewaterability a wide variety of methods including ultrasonication feng et al 2009 microwave irradiation liu et al 2016a bioleaching murugesan et al 2014 hydrothermal process wang et al 2017 electrolysis electrocoagulation gharibi et al 2013 visigalli et al 2017 fenton peroxidation neyens et al 2004 zhen et al 2014b and the addition of nanoparticles ju et al 2016 you et al 2017 have been suggested however the was dewatering is not so easy and the effective dewatering process requires the rapid destruction of the rigid structures of cell walls and extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge flocs facilitating the release of bound water kim et al 2016 in a previous study zhen et al 2012c proposed a sulfate radical so4 based oxidation process to condition the was for the enhancement of dewaterability persulfate s2o8 2 through the activation by heat uv light or transition metals fe2 co2 etc is capable of generating powerful sulfate radicals with high redox potential for one electron transfer e 0 so4 s2o8 2 2 43 vshe eq 1 wardman 1989 the so4 is able to destroy the particular functional groups of fluorescing substances e g aromatic protein tryptophan protein like matters etc in eps breakdown the linkages in the polymeric backbone and rupture bacterial cells resulting in the liberation of eps bound water and intracellular materials from cells and subsequently improved dewaterability zhen et al 2012a b 2013a b this process using ferrous iron fe2 as the catalyst demonstrated a sufficiently marked enhancement of the was dewaterability with up to 88 8 capillary suction time cst reduction within only 1 min under 1 2 mmol s2o8 2 g vss 1 5 mmol fe2 g vss and ph 3 0 8 5 eq 1 zhen et al 2012c compared with some other activators fe2 in the form of ferrous salts e g feso4 4h2o owns more advantages of low cost nontoxicity easy storage use convenient operation and very fast reaction rate consequently it can be a cost efficient and attractive alternative for improving dewaterability from the perspective of process engineering because of the superior features and good performances fe2 activated persulfate s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation process has gained great attention most recently and been extensively investigated for the disintegration and dewatering of was liu et al 2016b oncu et al 2015 ren et al 2015 shi et al 2015a b song et al 2016a waclawek et al 2015 zhen et al 2013b 2017 1 s2o8 2 fe2 so4 fe3 so4 2 as an alternative zero valent iron in the form of powder fe0 zvi sahinkaya et al 2015 can also be used as the catalyst in place of fe2 li et al 2016 song et al 2016b zhou et al 2015 in this process the surface of fe0 corrodes spontaneously under aerobic or anaerobic conditions releasing fe2 and or h2 in accordance with eqs 2 and 3 liang and lai 2008 also persulfate could directly react with fe0 to generate fe2 in accordance with eq 4 liang and lai 2008 then the resulting fe2 catalyzes s2o8 2 to produce so4 just like in s2o8 2 fe2 process eq 1 meanwhile the ferric ions fe3 produced from s2o8 2 fe0 process can be further reduced into fe2 at the zvi metallic surface following eq 5 bremner et al 2006 kallel et al 2009 liang and lai 2008 realizing the catalyst fe2 regeneration and recycling 2 fe0 0 5o2 h2o 2fe2 4oh 3 fe0 2h2o fe2 2oh h2 4 s2o8 2 fe0 fe2 2so4 2 5 fe0 2fe3 3fe2 the use of fe0 could reduce sulfate radical consumption by excess fe2 and avoid the introduction of other anions s2o8 2 fe0 process would be thus efficient in water treatment with selected organic contaminants as targets kambhu et al 2017 oh et al 2010 xiong et al 2014 but the performance might be discounted more or less when utilized for the dewatering of high solid was containing complex and even unknown components one of main reasons for this problem is the relatively complex radical pathways of s2o8 2 fe0 process eqs 2 5 and the major step that is contributing to so4 production may shift with operating conditions and sludge characteristics therefore whether or not fe0 can substitute for or even be comparable with ferrous salts for the activation of persulfate to sulfate radicals in was dewatering still needs clarifying in addition fe0 corrosion according to eqs 2 and 3 could be a vital even not the sole factor governing was dewatering performance it has been observed that acidic conditions ph 4 0 could promote the corrosion of fe0 and the release of fe2 in h2o2 fe0 system accelerating sludge disintegration sahinkaya et al 2015 or the removal of phenolic compounds kallel et al 2009 the enhanced fe0 corrosion and fe2 release under acidic conditions may be advantageous to s2o8 2 fe0 process as well the objectives of this study were to i compare the catalyzing behaviors and potentials of two types of iron catalysts i e fe2 vs fe0 to disintegrate and enhance was dewaterability in persulfate based oxidation process ii investigate the physiochemical characteristics of was i e sludge solubilization disintegration different eps fractions particle size chemical states of several elements morphology etc under different pretreatment conditions to unravel the underlying dewatering mechanisms and iii evaluate several possible strategies in increasing fe0 corrosion and was dewatering efficiency by s2o8 2 fe0 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials waste activated sludge was used in the present study was collected from the discharge of the secondary clarifier of a local full scale wwtp located in tsukuba city japan the was sample after screened through a 4 0 mm sieve to remove grit was transferred to the laboratory within 1 h and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator prior to use all the tests were completed within 2 days after sampling the fundamental properties of such was are shown in table 1 potassium persulfate k2s2o8 99 5 wt ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 4h2o 99 0 wt and fe0 power 95 pure particle size 150 nm were obtained from wako pure chemical industries ltd japan all the chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received without further purification stock solution of ferrous salts 0 5 mol fe2 l was freshly prepared in deionized water before use sulfuric acid 5 mol l was applied to adjust the ph when needed 2 2 procedures for was conditioning batch experiments were carried out to compare the potential of two catalyst iron sources i e fe2 vs fe0 to disintegrate and enhance was dewaterability in persulfate oxidation process the experiments were conducted in a series of 500 ml glass beakers with 300 ml of was suspensions at its inherent ph unless requested elsewhere the chemical reactions were initiated by adding s2o8 2 fe2 or s2o8 2 fe0 conditioner into was samples at a fixed molar ratio of 0 8 based on our previous studies zhen et al 2012a c the concentrations of persulfate for the experiments were 0 20 0 40 0 80 and 1 20 mmol g vs of was and the corresponding concentrations of fe2 or fe0 were 0 25 0 50 1 00 and 1 50 mmol g vs of was the mixture was continuously agitated for at least 20 min at 200 rpm to ensure complete peroxidation the control experiments without using conditioner was also performed for comparison for the purpose of improving the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process several different strategies were further proposed and assessed i the catalyst fe0 was added in one time i e all was added initially or two times i e half was add initially and the left added after 5 min of conditioning ii the was suspensions was first adjusted to acidic conditions i e ph 3 0 by using 5 mol l sulfuric acid solution before the addition of s2o8 2 and fe0 and iii the was ph was adjusted to 3 0 while adding fe0 in two times all the tests were conducted in duplicate and the average values with the standard deviations are reported 2 3 dewaterability and settleability the was dewaterability was evaluated by using vacuum filtration method as described previously zhen et al 2013a a 3 5 cm standard buchner funnel equipped with a diaphragm vacuum pump dap 15 ulvac kiko inc japan and advantec r glass fiber filter gs 25 toyo roshi kaisha ltd japan was employed for this purpose 5 ml of treated was samples was continuously dewatered at the vacuum pressure of 1 5 kg cm2 for 120 s both the filtrate volume and the filtration time were computed at predetermined time intervals to visualize the dewatering kinetics of the was the dry solids content as a function of filtration time was then calculated and used to indicate the dewaterability of was sludge volume sv was also measured to assess the sludge settleability 2 4 eps extraction and analysis three types of eps fractions including slime eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted following the successive extraction protocols detailed before li and yang 2007 zhen et al 2013a firstly was samples was centrifuged 8000 g for 15 min at 4 c and the collected supernatant was regarded as s eps the sludge pellets left were then re suspended to its original volume by adding nacl solution 0 05 wt 70 c and vortexed by a vortex genie 2 scientific industries inc usa for 1 min followed by centrifugation 8000 g for 10 min at 4 c to collect lb eps the bottom pellets were re suspended using nacl solution and then heat treated in a water bath at 60 c for 30 min tb eps was separated through centrifugation 8000 g for 15 min at 4 c the eps samples filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe driven filter millipore co usa was used for the analysis of protein pn and polysaccharide ps pn was estimated by the corrected lowry procedure as detailed by frolund et al 1996 and ps was stained with the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 2 5 other analysis the water content total solids ts and volatile solids vs were estimated according to the standard methods apha 1998 the ph was determined using a horiba compact ph meter b 212 japan total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble cod scod were determined using cod digest vials hach loveland co usa the concentration of ammonium nitrogen nh4 was analyzed using ion chromatography with a conductivity detector the concentrations of fe2 3 ions were determined by phenanthroline spectrophotometry at 525 nm hi96721 hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa a rotational viscometer iscotester vt 03f rion co ltd japan with spindle no 5 at 62 5 rpm was used to measure the apparent viscosity of the was samples treated under different operational conditions the particle size distribution of the sludge samples was analyzed by the eye tech particle size and shape analyzer microtrac asvr 9320 x100 usa the microstructure of was samples was visualized using the hitachi s 4800 field emission scanning electron microscope sem integrating energy dispersive x ray analyzer eds hitachi ltd japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to identify the chemical states of c o n s and fe in sludge samples xps measurements were carried out on an rbd upgraded phi 5000c esca system perkin elmer with mg k α radiation h 1253 6 ev the whole spectra 0 1100 ev and the narrow spectra of all the elements with much high resolution were both recorded by using rbd 147 interface rbd enterprises usa with the augerscan 3 21 software dissolved irons fe2 3 mg g fe0 from the fe0 powder were calculated following eq 6 song et al 2016b 6 dissolved irons mg g fe 0 c fe t c fe 0 v fe 0 0 where cfe 0 mg l is the indigenous dissolved iron concentration in the raw was cfe t mg l is the dissolved iron concentration in the pretreated sludge at the pretreatment time of t min v l is the sludge volume and fe0 0 is the amount of fe0 powder added during conditioning fe0 0 fe0 dosage mmol g vs 56 mg mmol fe v l vs concentration g l 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance of the results was conducted by means of one way variance analysis anova using a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to identify the strength of the linear correlation between two parameters the correlation r can range between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 a perfect positive correlation and 0 the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 the statistical analysis was carried out using the software sigmaplot 12 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 was dewatering performance catalyst fe2 vs fe0 effects of catalyst iron species fe2 vs fe0 and s2o8 2 fe2 0 dosages 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 25 0 4 0 5 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs on the was dewatering performance were evaluated and are compared in fig 1 it can be seen that the persulfate oxidation with fe2 and fe0 as the catalyst possessed quite different dewatering behaviors s2o8 2 fe2 process had a considerable impact on the dewatering efficiency and kinetics of was fig 1a the application of fe2 led to a shorter time of dewatering and higher dry solids content and the dry solids content increased with the applied s2o8 2 fe2 dosages the dry solids content of was approached the platform of 3 2 0 3 wt after only 30 s of mechanical filtration at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 0 2 0 25 mmol g vs it further climbed up to 4 3 0 3 wt at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 0 8 1 0 mmol g vss and then to 5 1 0 8 wt 30 s when s2o8 2 fe2 dosages were increased to 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs whereas the dry solids content for the untreated was i e 0 0 0 0 mmol g vs at this moment remained comparatively low being 1 8 0 1 wt p 0 05 in order to achieve the similar dry solids content it had to take another roughly 90 s for filtration filtration time is a critical factor governing the mechanical dewatering cost the shortened dewatering time undoubtedly would reduce was treatment cost considerably the corresponding percentages of water removed from treated was suspensions after 30 s of dewatering were in the range of 72 7 2 9 82 7 2 9 while it was 51 5 1 4 fig 1b the observations verified the great effectiveness of s2o8 2 fe2 process in enhancing water removal as well as solids liquid separation agreeing well with our and other findings kim et al 2016 ren et al 2015 shi et al 2015b zhen et al 2012c 2013a in sharp contrast the influence of the persulfate oxidation when activated with fe0 on sludge dewaterability seemed statistically insignificant p 0 05 fig 1c as can be seen even though s2o8 2 fe0 dosages were elevated to the maximum of 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs the increase in dry solids content was still negligible i e 2 0 0 0 wt at 30 s moreover the values of water removed kept consistently low irrespective of the used s2o8 2 fe0 dosages fig 1d it has been well documented that the main mechanism for sludge dewatering in this process relies upon the generation of powerful sulfate radicals so4 eq 1 which induces sludge cells lysis and the release of bound water zhen et al 2012a low enhancement of dewaterability in this scenario implied that fe0 was less comparable with fe2 to initiate persulfate decomposition this is not surprising since fe0 usually needs to dissolve before reaction with s2o8 2 eqs 2 4 hence the dewatering efficiency was hardly promoted the results were in line with those of zhou et al 2015 who noticed that the effect of s2o8 2 fe0 on was dewatering was limited and the reduction percentage of cst was 50 even when the addition of s2o8 2 fe0 was ca 2 2 40 6 mmol g vs differently song et al 2016b highlighted the positive roles of this process in conditioning anaerobically digested sludge and attained the up to 90 cst reduction at ca 2 4 48 2 mmol g vs presumably due to the rupture and biodegradation of sludge eps cells throughout fermentation this reflected that the performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process was very unstable and closely related to sludge properties dewatering efficiencies of s2o8 2 fe0 process might differ greatly with the properties and origins of studied sludges note that this is not the case for s2o8 2 fe2 process and it always gives highly promoted dewatering efficiency regardless of sludge types characteristics and sources shi et al 2015b song et al 2016a zhen et al 2012a 3 2 release of fe2 in fe0 corrosion process fe ion fe2 3 concentration of was filtrate can be an indicator reflecting the internal oxidizing abilities as illustrated in fig 2 a when ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 4h2o was used as the catalyst donor a sufficient fe2 could be provided the measured concentration rose from 49 0 1 3 to 241 7 21 6 mg l while s2o8 2 fe2 dosages were increased from 0 4 0 5 to 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs in comparison the liberation of fe ion in s2o8 2 fe0 system was rate limiting and time consuming despite that the dissolved iron from fe0 gradually increased with s2o8 2 fe2 dosages the maximum value was 46 0 2 5 mg l at 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs still around 6 1 lower than that measured at 0 4 0 5 mmol g vs in s2o8 2 fe2 system p 0 0270 0 05 the corresponding dissolution degree of fe0 in this situation was only 65 4 2 4 mg g fe0 indicating that most of fe0 particles added was not dissolved and utilized efficiently this was mainly caused by the formation of the oxide iron layer consisting of fe2 3 phase near the fe0 metallic core and fe3 oxide near the oxide water interface su et al 2015 which resulted in the slow corrosion and fe2 liberation and or hindered the contact of fe0 with s2o8 2 eq 7 moreover a myriad of complex gel like biopolymers in was flocs tended to further passivate the fe0 particles it is also reported that fe0 is capable of activating s2o8 2 to produce so4 in a direct way that does not involve the dissolved fe2 eq 7 oh et al 2010 thus to determine the importance of each iron species the correlation between fe2 0 content and dry solids content obtained 30 s filtration was established fig 2b it is clear that was dewaterability exhibited a highly significant positive correlation with fe2 content r 0 882 p 0 05 for measured fe2 r 0 962 p 0 01 for applied fe2 dosage however no clear correlation with fe0 dosage existed r 0 579 p 0 05 meanwhile because of low corrosion rate the dissolved fe2 content was too low to exert any effect on dewatering r 0 529 p 0 05 it could be inferred from the above discussion that s2o8 2 was mainly activated by fe2 in s2o8 2 fe2 or s2o8 2 fe0 process rather than fe0 low fe2 available in s2o8 2 fe0 system restricted the sulfate radical generation as a result of which the dewaterability of was even after pretreated was still poor fig 1c obviously the rapid surface inactivation and the slow corrosion of fe0 particles were the limiting steps of was dewatering by s2o8 2 fe0 in another study xiong and his colleagues also confirmed that orange g removal by s2o8 2 fe0 was limited by the fe2 release step xiong et al 2014 7 2s2o8 2 fe0 2so4 fe2 2so4 2 furthermore high addition and low utilization rate of fe0 will discount the reliability and feasibility of this option which ultimately limits its wide applications in real world scenarios thus fe0 can hardly substitute for ferrous salts as the catalyst for persulfate based was dewatering in addition high fe0 residues that is retained within was flocs makes the subsequent sludge treatment and disposal more difficult and costlier as well although the undissolved fe0 can be recycled as done by several researchers song et al 2016b zhou et al 2014 2015 it is still unable to compensate the expense invested for its recovery thereby making s2o8 2 fe0 process less cost effective 3 3 was flocs characteristics and their correlations with dewatering performance 3 3 1 ph variations over conditioning time fig 3 shows the ph variations over time in s2o8 2 fe2 0 systems in s2o8 2 fe2 system fig 3a the ph of was suspensions dropped greatly within the first 1 min of conditioning and thereafter it kept stable until the termination of experimental run the reduction in ph increased with the applied s2o8 2 fe2 dosages dropping from the initial 7 0 to 6 3 at 0 2 0 25 mmol g vs and then to 3 0 at 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs a similar phenomenon was also documented by liang et al 2003 in the thermally activated persulfate system for trichloroethylene tce degradations the reduced ph could be ascribed to the release of h from the decomposition of persulfate li et al 2017 and the production of small molecular weight organic acids due to the oxidation of organic compounds by the so4 liang et al 2003 oh et al 2010 meanwhile the hydrolysis of produced fe3 and the interconversion of so4 to ho following eqs 8 10 could also generate h or consume oh liang and su 2009 resulting in a drop in ph dogliotti and hayon 1967 xiong et al 2014 lower ph revealed the production of more sulfate radicals and the occurrence of stronger oxidizing reactions these observations demonstrated that the activation of s2o8 2 by the added fe2 was very rapid which produced the plenty of so4 and consequently promoted was dewaterability immediately 8 fe3 xh2o fe oh x 3 x xh 9 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 at all phs 10 so4 oh ho so4 2 at alkaline phs for s2o8 2 fe0 system the ph at the various initial s2o8 2 fe0 dosages maintained relatively unchangeable close to natural condition around 7 0 fig 3b the difference in ph variations suggested that the reactions of two s2o8 2 fe2 0 systems with was proceeded in different patterns as verified in section 3 2 fe0 was the source of fe2 in s2o8 2 fe0 system and whether the fe0 can catalyze s2o8 2 into so4 closely depended upon the fe2 liberation rate before activating s2o8 2 fe0 would react with o2 h2o or h to generate fe2 as well as oh in accordance with eqs 2 and 3 increasing the solution ph li et al 2017 oh et al 2010 the increase in ph would be offset subsequently by the released h organic acids or the consumption of oh as noted in s2o8 2 fe2 process in this way the variations of ph were slight li et al 2017 also observed the similar results in degradation of p nitrophenol by fe0 permanganate pm s2o8 2 system however on the basis of low fe ion concentration and poor was dewaterability it should be highlighted that the above mentioned reactions inducing ph variations along with so4 production and conversion might have happened very weakly due to the slow fe0 corrosion this might be the core reason responsible for the stable ph level 3 3 2 was disintegration and simultaneous oxidizing degradation of the released substances fig 4 shows the changes in cod solubilization and ammonia release after 20 min of pretreatment using two s2o8 2 fe2 0 systems overall the scod concentration rose with the s2o8 2 fe2 0 dosages fig 4a indicating the provoked was disintegration solubilization and release of intercellular substances it has been well recognized that eps and cell envelope are the critical elements limiting sludge dewatering as they control the integrity and colloidal stability of the was flocs as well as the water binding capacity hence the good was dewatering will be accompanied with the effective destruction of eps and cell envelope an interesting phenomenon observed herein was that the measured scod in the case of s2o8 2 fe2 process was significantly lower than those obtained by s2o8 2 fe0 process p 0 05 this observation was sharp contrast to the dewatering outcomes illustrated in fig 1 in which it has been demonstrated that s2o8 2 fe2 process was highly superior to s2o8 2 fe0 process in promoting was dewatering actually those results were not conflicting and could be expected as well the scod obtained herein only represented the remaining soluble organics after secondary oxidization but not the all released during the pretreatment massive sulfate radicals produced from s2o8 2 fe2 process are strong and reactive oxidants thereby they cannot only cause the rupture of eps and cells as well as the release of extracellular and intercellular substances but simultaneously non selectively mineralize the extracted organic components via one electron oxidation pathway kim et al 2016 likewise the study carried out by oncu and co workers reported that the utilization of s2o8 2 fe2 clearly resulted in oxidation of the organic matters in sludge as demonstrated by decreases in both scod and tcod oncu et al 2015 in comparison the secondary mineralization of eluted organics seemed un happen because of low level of so4 in s2o8 2 fe0 system several lines of researches even corroborated that the oxidized organic matters produce an organic radical which further stimulates the decomposition of more s2o8 2 into so4 and the degradation of organics edwards and gallopo 1971 kim et al 2016 as a result the scod left in the filtrate undoubtedly tended to be sufficiently abased in literature the disintegration degree ddscod is calculated as the ratio between scod increase by modification and tcod and is normally applied to express the was solubilization efficiency of one pretreatment method zhen et al 2014a in this context it will be unsuitable for this scenario fig 4b shows the ammonia nh4 results ammonia is another valuable parameter indicating was solubilization the released intercellular organic nitrogen from the lysed bacterial cells are non enzymatically degraded into peptides and amino acids and finally carboxylic acids and nh4 kim et al 2016 li et al 2013 resulting in higher ammonia concentration of interest the nh4 outcomes displayed a tendency similar to scod the s2o8 2 fe2 system did not produce a higher nh4 concentration in spite of the great enhancement in was dewatering being 105 0 127 0 mg l as compared with 77 0 126 0 mg l for s2o8 2 fe0 process this was because in addition to the capability of decomposing organic nitrogen into ammonia the excess sulfate radicals were able to gain electrons from the reductive ammonia nitrogen nh3 and nh4 and converted them into no2 n no3 n and even n2 a higher valence state deng and ezyske 2011 a similar outcome was reported by ren et al 2015 who indicated that no3 n was the major component of nh4 n oxidation deng and ezyske 2011 also employed sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process to treat a mature landfill leachate and achieved 90 of cod and ammonia removal the concurrent removal of cod and ammonia nh4 from was filtrate would lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and thus reduce operational expense the results presented in fig s1 in supplementary material also indicated that the was conditioned by s2o8 2 fe2 process produced lower dry solids this is very important in consideration of the subsequent management transportation and ultimate disposal e g anaerobic digestion landfill incineration compost etc hence from an environmental and economic perspective the s2o8 2 fe2 system possesses much greater promise for was dewatering 3 3 3 change in particle size of was flocs fig 5 depicts the variations of was floc size the s2o8 2 fe2 0 processes decreased the particle size and the decrease was magnified with the increased oxidant dosages moreover the influence by s2o8 2 fe2 process was comparatively pronounced indicating much harsher disintegration to sludge flocs the so4 oxidatively broken up the rigid and swollen gel networks surrounding was zoogloea as well as the cell envelope and destabilized the flocs steric structure thereby causing the collapse of was flocs and the decrease in particle size thus the size of was exhibited a perceptible downshift the similar results were also confirmed in our zhen et al 2012a b c and other publications kim et al 2016 ren et al 2015 applying s2o8 2 fe2 process as a pretreatment method to modify sludge to date there still have been an inconsistence with the effect of particle size on was dewatering in general large flocs relate with good dewaterability and rapid solid liquid separation however the was with the decreased particle size herein was characterized by high dewaterability in fact the effective rupture of was flocs was favorable to sludge dewatering this is because so4 mineralized the extracellular biopolymers located on the flocs surface such as proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances which could damage the hydrophilic groups and water bonds such as oh and nh bonds and reduce the water holding capability of flocs facilitating the release of bound water and solid water separation meanwhile the disintegration of was flocs might also create more passages for water removal more importantly the powerful destruction in addition to inducing the reduction in particle size benefited the liberation of plenty of cells trapped within sludge and the subsequent lysis as a consequence the water of hydration bound inside the cells was released into the liquid phase which conduced to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability this was in line with those of wang et al 2017 who achieved a sludge with the reduced particle size but significantly promoted dewaterability after hydrothermal treatment regarding the floc size according to mikkelsen 2001 the supracolloidal flocs in the range of 0 5 5 μm primary particles had the most adverse impact on was dewaterability and the dewaterability deteriorated with the increase of the quantities of flocs in this size range although the application of s2o8 2 fe2 process caused the breakage of sludge flocs and the increase in fine particles the fe3 from the s2o8 2 fe2 system serving as coagulants could absorb onto the negatively charged sludge flocs and agglomerate the smaller particles via charge neutralization absorption bridging and precipitation catching liu et al 2012 promoting the re flocculation of the fine flocs zhen et al 2012a the particle size of the treated was still mainly fell within the range of 40 μm far larger than the size range of primary particles the insert a in fig 5 in this way the impact associated with the particle size variations on dewaterability was almost negligible the two step mechanisms advanced oxidation and fe3 re flocculation were also hypothesized by zhen et al 2012a with s2o8 2 fe2 system and yu et al 2016 with h2o2 fe2 process in conditioning sewage sludge 3 3 4 was settling behavior after 20 min of conditioning fig s2 in supplementary material compares the settleability of the was samples pretreated at different conditions as stated before owing to the relatively limited influence on the particle size change s2o8 2 fe2 0 processes in the current study did not affect the sludge settling behaviors and there was no any relationship observed between settling characteristics and the generated fe ion r 0 024 p 0 947 0 05 the was had extremely poor settleability regardless of the types of catalyst and s2o8 2 fe2 0 dosages in agreement with the findings in our previous work with s2o8 2 fe2 to condition sludge zhen et al 2013a the principle reason for that is still less known and remains to be well recognized in addition no clear correlation was detected between the settling behavior and dewaterability r 0 694 p 0 194 0 05 for s2o8 2 fe2 r 0 697 p 0 191 0 05 for s2o8 2 fe0 uncovering that the sludge with high dewaterability does not necessarily exhibit satisfactory settleability was is a multiphase medium containing water mineral and organic substances microorganism cells and eps etc and its dewatering has been reported to be controlled by many physicochemical parameters mikkelsen and keiding 2002 you et al 2017 in other words although the sludge dewatering can be reinforced by improving set settleability in theory this is probably not a critical factor governing the dewaterability in addition the results shown in fig s3 in supplementary material reveal that the was viscosity fell within a range of around 76 5 112 5 mpa s which exhibited clear correlation with dewaterability r 0 781 p 0 029 0 05 consistent with the results of jin et al 2004 li and yang 2007 and zhen et al 2012c the was flocs with high viscosity had low ability to dewater 3 3 5 re distribution and concurrent mineralization of different eps fractions the eps is one of the critical governing factors with respect to the was dewaterability the s2o8 2 fe2 pretreatment had a profound effect on the distribution of eps as seen from fig 6 a the total eps content i e pn ps in lb eps and tb eps fractions exhibited a stepwise decrease with increasing s2o8 2 fe2 dosages whereas it was slightly increased in s eps the initial eps content in s eps lb eps and tb eps fractions for the raw was was 5 26 6 43 and 22 06 mg g vs respectively it dramatically declined to 20 33 mg g vs for tb eps fraction when s2o8 2 fe2 dosages were elevated to 0 4 0 5 mmol g vs decreasing by 7 8 the corresponding s eps value climbed up to 9 57 mg g vs increasing by 81 9 the decrease in bound eps in particular tb eps accompanied with increase in s eps fraction reflected a fact that s2o8 2 fe2 process effectively dissolved the bound eps and transferred them into the liquid thus increasing the s eps level to some degree with further increasing s2o8 2 fe2 dosages to 0 8 1 0 mmol g vs the lb eps and tb eps dropped sharply to 2 60 and 4 01 mg g vs drops of roughly 62 2 and 80 3 respectively when compared with s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 0 4 0 5 mmol g vs moreover the s eps decreased as well by 25 2 the observations coincided well with the cod profile fig 4a reconfirming that the s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation not only was capable of dissolving the lb eps and tb eps but also was able to completely mineralize the extracted bound eps in sharp contrast the effect of s2o8 2 fe0 system was comparatively slight the eps content did not change substantially until the imposed s2o8 2 fe0 dosages reached 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs even that the solubilization of tb eps in this scenario still kept extremely low what was worse the released eps were mostly retained in the s eps fraction in place of oxidizing degradation owing to the lacking of sufficient so4 fig 6b eps have a high affinity for water and are highly hydrated with water content up to 98 jin et al 2004 the sludge with high eps content thus has high difficulty with dewatering the greatly oxidized eps provided the clear evidence for faster water seepage as noticed in the presence of high s2o8 2 fe2 dosages during mechanical filtration fig 1 due to the difference in spatial locations within was flocs the role of each eps fraction in was dewatering often differs the experimental data indicated the poor correlation between the was dewaterability determined by the dry solids content of the dewatered sludge with the individual biopolymers pn and ps as well as the total eps in s eps fraction r 0 289 p 0 450 0 05 for pn r 0 355 p 0 348 0 05 for ps r 0 087 p 0 824 0 05 for total eps fig 6c s eps located in the liquid phase of sludge were easily separated with free water by mechanical filtration and thus hardly affected was dewaterability due to chemical cross linking and physical entanglement effect arising from high molecular weight biopolymers present in s eps matrix s eps fraction was considered to be more crucial in controlling sludge viscosity and settleability zhen et al 2013a in comparison the contribution of lb eps to the dewatering performance appeared to be greater the dewaterability corresponded oppositely to the individual pn and the total eps in extracted lb eps fraction r 0 871 p 0 002 0 05 for pn r 0 787 p 0 012 0 05 for total eps while weakly correlating with the ps r 0 206 p 0 594 0 05 fig 6d lb eps diffusing from the surface of was flocs to the water solution are highly porous and dispersive li and yang 2007 and an effective breakdown of lb eps reduces the relative hydrophobicity of the sludge and benefits water removal resulting in an increase in was dewatering performance the most remarkable effect was then identified for tb eps the was dewaterability had a closer negative correlation with the amounts of each biopolymer and total eps measured in tb eps fraction r 0 818 p 0 007 0 05 for pn r 0 689 p 0 007 0 05 for ps r 0 791 p 0 011 0 05 for total eps fig 6e hinting the particularly crucial role of tb esp in was dewatering to date there is a consensus on the role of lb eps whereas the statements associated with tb eps are still more or less contradictory the current observation matched well with our and other previous works ye et al 2012 zhen et al 2012a 2013a but somewhat conflicted with the findings obtained by li and yang 2007 and yu et al 2017 who highlighted that lb eps were more influential with respect to sludge sedimentation and biomass water separation than tb eps the discrepancy might be in part attributable to the differences in eps extraction methods and pretreatment techniques investigated additionally according to the previous reports by zhou et al 2001 and yuan et al 2014 it was found that the conventional mechanical dewatering techniques could only remove the water in s eps and lb eps this implied that the real difficulty to dewater for was might more lie in the presence of a large quantity of tb eps and cells enmeshed in the gel like matrix the cells carry an abundant amount of hydration water 3 wt of total water and the water cannot be removed unless the cell walls are broken down tb eps located in the inner layers of the was flocs are tightly adhered to the cell wall apart from bringing an amount of bound water into the aggregates the presence of tb eps could also restrict the lysis of cells and subsequent release of intracellular water by functioning as the protective shell accordingly the adequate breakdown of gel like tb eps matrix is a critical requisite for the removal of both eps held water and cell water which would be the major cause for the great enhancement of was dewaterability obtained by s2o8 2 fe2 system 3 4 key composition and structure of organic matters related to was dewatering xps measurements were utilized to unravel the chemical changes for c n and o elements on the surface of was flocs before and after pretreatment the high resolution xps spectra at c 1s shows the appearance of four main c containing species fig 7 the typical peaks at 284 5 and 286 1 ev corresponded to aliphatic aromatic carbon c c c h and c c dai et al 2017 and carbon bounded as c o and c n amide i respectively castillo et al 2016 the peak at 287 5 ev was assigned to o c nh bond of amino acid dai et al 2017 which was also identified in the o 1s high resolution spectrum peak at 532 3 ev this peak also correlated with the n 1s high resolution region which shows the appearance of two peaks at 399 6 and 400 8 ev resulting from the n of amino acid the peak at 288 5 ev was linked to o c o bond of the carboxyl acids the peaks at 530 8 and 531 5 ev were characteristic of oxygen bounded as o h and c o castillo et al 2016 wen et al 2014 respectively the predominant components in was matrixes are protein and polysaccharide with smaller amounts of dna lipids etc the peaks indicated by c c c h c n c o and o c nh provided the direct evidence for the existence of protein zhen et al 2012b zhu et al 2012 and the peaks related to o h and c o the two most common functional groups in carbohydrate mecozzi and pietrantonio 2006 reflected the carbohydrate from the results in figure it was clear that three elements spectra were quite different after pretreatment as compared to the raw was fig 7a the relative intensities of those peaks in the was sample treated by s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation displayed a dramatic drop fig 7b which provided the information on the degradation of protein and carbohydrate however the decrease caused by s2o8 2 fe0 oxidation was comparatively low in accordance to the eps results fig 6 it has been proved that the interactions of the biopolymers i e protein and carbohydrate with hydrogen bond such as oh and nh bonds contribute greatly to the water binding properties jin et al 2004 the breakage of the water bonds by electrophilic attack by so4 radicals from s2o8 2 fe2 process altered the physical properties in particular water holding capacity of was flocs and thus caused the promotion of the dewaterability 3 5 characterization of floc morphology by sem along with eds mapping the apparent morphology of the was treated at various conditions was characterized through sem eds analysis to verify the underlying dewatering mechanisms fig 8 before pretreatment fig 8a well defined flocs similar to those observed in was samples liu et al 2016c yu et al 2017 zhen et al 2013a were observed a number of cocci and rod shaped microbial cells embedded within or closely interlacing with the gel like eps matrix were identified clearly the intimate cross link of eps cell induced a compact and glutinous structure giving rise to the poor was dewaterability the microstructure however underwent extensive transformation when subject to s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation and the eps cell complex was definitely disrupted fig 8b well corresponding to the results of eps fig 6 and xps examination fig 7 due to the collapse of the protective eps layer most of the unentrapped cells have already been severally fragmented under the stress of powerful so4 radicals visible cracks arose on cell surface and very few cells left kept intact showcasing the effective breakage of cells the cracks could serve as water channels allowing much more release of intracellular materials see carbon eds mapping in fig 8b and cell water into the free water and finally improving the water transport and separation the aforesaid observations consisted well with the results of our previous studies zhen et al 2012b 2013a based upon the above observations the two step dewatering mechanisms for s2o8 2 fe2 process could be proposed as follows i the disruption of eps cell chains and the escape of entrapped cells and ii the sludge cells lysis and the seepage of bulk water molecules comparatively the flocs treated with s2o8 2 fe0 process showed the morphology similar to the raw sludge fig 8c the eps cell complex still remained intact and regular and no any observable change occurred due to the less production of so4 caused by the low dissolution rate of fe0 as illustrated by eds mapping the distribution of iron in fe0 fed flocs was relatively uneven in sharp contrast with the high homogeneity in fe2 fed was flocs the signal of iron was strong in some areas but very weak in others unraveling that the majority of added fe0 particles kept undissolved and unused in accordance with the findings in fig 2a eps interlaced with cells closely sustaining a highly hydrated and integrated flocs so the was in the presence of s2o8 2 fe0 presented a high eps content fig 6b and poor dewaterability fig 1c once again proving the less promise of using fe0 as the catalyst to activate persulfate for sludge dewatering evidently the proper choice of iron catalysts fe2 or fe0 is very important for the enhancement of was dewaterability in order to visualize the discrepancy in the catalyzing behaviors and the roles in enhancing was dewaterability of two iron catalysts the underlying principles were proposed and are illustrated in fig 9 3 6 strategies to improve the s2o8 2 fe0 performance in enhancing was dewatering as confirmed in the above mentioned results the dissolution of fe0 particles is rate limiting step in s2o8 2 fe0 based dewatering process thus for the purpose of improving the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process several strategies i e prolonged pretreatment time adding way of fe0 ph adjustment to 3 0 or combination of ph adjustment with increased addition times were explored and evaluated as can be seen in fig 10 a prolonging conditioning time could increase the was dewatering performance but the enhancement was statistically insignificant p 0 4226 0 05 with dry solids content increasing from 2 0 0 0 to only 2 3 0 3 wt after 30 s filtration the remarkable promotion was noticed while adding fe0 in two times p 0 01 dry solids content correspondingly arose to around 3 0 0 0 wt this result was in well agreement with the previous findings of yan et al 2011 who used fe3o4 nanoparticles as the initiator of persulfate in treating sulfamonomethoxine smm and reported that the addition of the nanoparticles in several times could enhance the system performance with the degradation efficiency of smm increasing from 36 5 to 46 9 adding fe0 in several times could to a certain degree avoid the too quick inactivation of metallic surface whereas the value in this scenario was still incomparable with the one obtained by s2o8 2 fe2 system i e 5 1 0 8 wt p 0 05 another strategy was to adjust initial ph to 3 0 the acidic condition could favor the corrosion of fe0 metallic surface promoting the release of more fe2 that could activate the persulfate kallel et al 2009 indeed the ph adjustment has enhanced the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 system with the dry solids content being up to 3 5 0 4 wt roughly 75 0 higher than s2o8 2 fe0 alone p 0 05 the corresponding percentages of water removed approached 74 7 2 9 fig 10b li et al 2017 developed a fe0 permanganate pm s2o8 2 system to decompose the p nitrophenol and also confirmed that the acidic ph was more favorable over neutral and alkaline conditions in cod removal the enhancement was further verified by the greatly accelerated corrosion rate of fe0 particles and the measured fe ion concentration as well as the dissolution degree of fe0 were elevated to 60 2 1 3 mg l and 86 7 1 2 mg g fe0 respectively fig 11 a low ph facilitates the abrasion of passive oxide iron layer which favored the localized corrosion and thus corrosion was accelerated subsequently as a result of this more so4 were successfully generated which decomposed the hydrophilic bonds in eps matrix fig s4 in supplementary material and fig 11b broken apart the cells fig s5 in supplementary material and subsequently aroused the enhancement in was dewaterability in another study using fe0 persulfate for the removal of organic g og xiong et al 2014 also attributed the increased og removal in low ph to the larger fe0 corrosion and the consequent greater so4 generation rate furthermore coupling ph 3 0 with two time s addition could further strengthen this impact unfortunately the combined process still failed in competing with s2o8 2 fe2 system for sludge dewatering indicating that this strategy was unsatisfactory either previously several other attempts have been also proposed to enhance the active dissolution of fe0 such as coupling with weak magnetic field xiong et al 2014 electrolysis electrocoagulation li et al 2016 etc nonetheless the ph adjustment increasing addition time or combination with other options may inevitably complicate the conditioning and dewatering processes increasing operating cost which severely restricts its commercial implementations in real world scenario therefore more works are still necessarily required prior to considering the real applications of s2o8 2 fe0 in place of s2o8 2 fe2 in wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that two iron catalysts i e fe2 vs fe0 displayed the different catalyzing behaviors for the decomposition of persulfate and was dewatering in terms of was dewaterability the fe2 exhibited a higher effectiveness than fe0 the dry solids content of treated was after only 30 s filtration reached up to 5 1 0 8 wt at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs increasing by 1 8 folds than raw was 1 8 0 1 wt whereas the increase in was dewaterability was very slight i e the highest dry solids content of 2 0 0 0 wt while fe0 was employed as the catalyst additional analysis demonstrated that lb eps and in particular tb eps were the key factors governing was dewaterability the abundant so4 from s2o8 2 fe2 system could effectively disrupt the gel like eps matrix break apart the cells and arouse the release of the water inside eps and cells facilitating water solid separation in the case of s2o8 2 fe0 the dissolution of fe0 particles was the rate limiting step due to the formation of oxide iron layer near fe0 metallic surface which resulted in the slow so4 production and thus hardly promoted was dewaterability more importantly except for enhancing was dewatering s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation could also concurrently degrade cod and ammonia from was filtrate lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and reduce operational expense this indicated that the proper choice of the iron catalysts is one of the most crucial matters for the enhancement of was dewaterability from an environmental and economic perspective the s2o8 2 fe2 system will hold a much greater promise for

19695,dewatering of waste activated sludge was is of major interest in its volume reduction transportation and ultimate disposal persulfate based oxidation process is a newly developed option for enhancing was dewaterability through the generation of powerful sulfate radicals so4 however the enhancement in was dewaterability by persulfate differs with the species of iron catalysts used in this study two types of iron catalysts i e fe2 vs fe0 were employed to initiate the persulfate s2o8 2 and the catalyzing behaviors and the underlying principles in enhancing was dewaterability were investigated and compared the fe2 exhibited the high effectiveness in catalyzing the decomposition of persulfate to sulfate radicals so4 inducing the greater improvement in was dewatering the was dewaterability indicated by dry solids content after filtration increased with the added s2o8 2 fe2 dosages with the dry solids content reaching up to 5 1 0 8 wt at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs after only 30 s filtration roughly 1 8 fold increase than raw was 1 8 0 1 wt in contrast the influence of the persulfate oxidation when activated with fe0 on was dewaterability was statistically insignificant the was dewaterability remained nearly unchanged i e dry solids content of 2 0 0 0 wt irrespective of the employed s2o8 2 fe0 dosages further analysis demonstrated that the was dewaterability negatively corresponded to loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the abundant so4 from s2o8 2 fe2 system could effectively disrupt the gel like eps matrix break apart the cells and subsequently arouse the release of the water inside eps and cells facilitating water solid separation in the case of s2o8 2 fe0 the dissolution of fe0 particles was the rate limiting step due to the formation of oxide iron layer near fe0 metallic surface which resulted in the slow so4 production and thus hardly promoted was dewaterability the ph adjustment could accelerate fe0 dissolution and enhance the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process to a certain degree but the effect was unsatisfactory additionally the observations regarding the dissolved organic matters and ammonium collectively revealed that except for enhancing was dewatering s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation could concurrently degrade cod and ammonia from was filtrate lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and reduce operational expense hence from an environmental and economic perspective the s2o8 2 fe2 system possesses much greater promise for was dewatering graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge dewatering persulfate based oxidation process iron catalysts extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction the management of waste activated sludge was accounts for approximately 50 60 of the operating cost of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and has become one of the main concerns appels et al 2008 to reduce the expenses of the subsequent transport and disposal was needs to be dewatered deeply and effectively to date the dewatering of such sludge still poses a huge technical challenge to water industry the water content of was is usually in the range of 95 99 and it is still up to 75 80 even after mechanical dewatering for decades the development of high performance techniques for deep dewatering of was has been being a high research priority in research communities to improve the was dewaterability a wide variety of methods including ultrasonication feng et al 2009 microwave irradiation liu et al 2016a bioleaching murugesan et al 2014 hydrothermal process wang et al 2017 electrolysis electrocoagulation gharibi et al 2013 visigalli et al 2017 fenton peroxidation neyens et al 2004 zhen et al 2014b and the addition of nanoparticles ju et al 2016 you et al 2017 have been suggested however the was dewatering is not so easy and the effective dewatering process requires the rapid destruction of the rigid structures of cell walls and extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge flocs facilitating the release of bound water kim et al 2016 in a previous study zhen et al 2012c proposed a sulfate radical so4 based oxidation process to condition the was for the enhancement of dewaterability persulfate s2o8 2 through the activation by heat uv light or transition metals fe2 co2 etc is capable of generating powerful sulfate radicals with high redox potential for one electron transfer e 0 so4 s2o8 2 2 43 vshe eq 1 wardman 1989 the so4 is able to destroy the particular functional groups of fluorescing substances e g aromatic protein tryptophan protein like matters etc in eps breakdown the linkages in the polymeric backbone and rupture bacterial cells resulting in the liberation of eps bound water and intracellular materials from cells and subsequently improved dewaterability zhen et al 2012a b 2013a b this process using ferrous iron fe2 as the catalyst demonstrated a sufficiently marked enhancement of the was dewaterability with up to 88 8 capillary suction time cst reduction within only 1 min under 1 2 mmol s2o8 2 g vss 1 5 mmol fe2 g vss and ph 3 0 8 5 eq 1 zhen et al 2012c compared with some other activators fe2 in the form of ferrous salts e g feso4 4h2o owns more advantages of low cost nontoxicity easy storage use convenient operation and very fast reaction rate consequently it can be a cost efficient and attractive alternative for improving dewaterability from the perspective of process engineering because of the superior features and good performances fe2 activated persulfate s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation process has gained great attention most recently and been extensively investigated for the disintegration and dewatering of was liu et al 2016b oncu et al 2015 ren et al 2015 shi et al 2015a b song et al 2016a waclawek et al 2015 zhen et al 2013b 2017 1 s2o8 2 fe2 so4 fe3 so4 2 as an alternative zero valent iron in the form of powder fe0 zvi sahinkaya et al 2015 can also be used as the catalyst in place of fe2 li et al 2016 song et al 2016b zhou et al 2015 in this process the surface of fe0 corrodes spontaneously under aerobic or anaerobic conditions releasing fe2 and or h2 in accordance with eqs 2 and 3 liang and lai 2008 also persulfate could directly react with fe0 to generate fe2 in accordance with eq 4 liang and lai 2008 then the resulting fe2 catalyzes s2o8 2 to produce so4 just like in s2o8 2 fe2 process eq 1 meanwhile the ferric ions fe3 produced from s2o8 2 fe0 process can be further reduced into fe2 at the zvi metallic surface following eq 5 bremner et al 2006 kallel et al 2009 liang and lai 2008 realizing the catalyst fe2 regeneration and recycling 2 fe0 0 5o2 h2o 2fe2 4oh 3 fe0 2h2o fe2 2oh h2 4 s2o8 2 fe0 fe2 2so4 2 5 fe0 2fe3 3fe2 the use of fe0 could reduce sulfate radical consumption by excess fe2 and avoid the introduction of other anions s2o8 2 fe0 process would be thus efficient in water treatment with selected organic contaminants as targets kambhu et al 2017 oh et al 2010 xiong et al 2014 but the performance might be discounted more or less when utilized for the dewatering of high solid was containing complex and even unknown components one of main reasons for this problem is the relatively complex radical pathways of s2o8 2 fe0 process eqs 2 5 and the major step that is contributing to so4 production may shift with operating conditions and sludge characteristics therefore whether or not fe0 can substitute for or even be comparable with ferrous salts for the activation of persulfate to sulfate radicals in was dewatering still needs clarifying in addition fe0 corrosion according to eqs 2 and 3 could be a vital even not the sole factor governing was dewatering performance it has been observed that acidic conditions ph 4 0 could promote the corrosion of fe0 and the release of fe2 in h2o2 fe0 system accelerating sludge disintegration sahinkaya et al 2015 or the removal of phenolic compounds kallel et al 2009 the enhanced fe0 corrosion and fe2 release under acidic conditions may be advantageous to s2o8 2 fe0 process as well the objectives of this study were to i compare the catalyzing behaviors and potentials of two types of iron catalysts i e fe2 vs fe0 to disintegrate and enhance was dewaterability in persulfate based oxidation process ii investigate the physiochemical characteristics of was i e sludge solubilization disintegration different eps fractions particle size chemical states of several elements morphology etc under different pretreatment conditions to unravel the underlying dewatering mechanisms and iii evaluate several possible strategies in increasing fe0 corrosion and was dewatering efficiency by s2o8 2 fe0 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials waste activated sludge was used in the present study was collected from the discharge of the secondary clarifier of a local full scale wwtp located in tsukuba city japan the was sample after screened through a 4 0 mm sieve to remove grit was transferred to the laboratory within 1 h and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator prior to use all the tests were completed within 2 days after sampling the fundamental properties of such was are shown in table 1 potassium persulfate k2s2o8 99 5 wt ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 4h2o 99 0 wt and fe0 power 95 pure particle size 150 nm were obtained from wako pure chemical industries ltd japan all the chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received without further purification stock solution of ferrous salts 0 5 mol fe2 l was freshly prepared in deionized water before use sulfuric acid 5 mol l was applied to adjust the ph when needed 2 2 procedures for was conditioning batch experiments were carried out to compare the potential of two catalyst iron sources i e fe2 vs fe0 to disintegrate and enhance was dewaterability in persulfate oxidation process the experiments were conducted in a series of 500 ml glass beakers with 300 ml of was suspensions at its inherent ph unless requested elsewhere the chemical reactions were initiated by adding s2o8 2 fe2 or s2o8 2 fe0 conditioner into was samples at a fixed molar ratio of 0 8 based on our previous studies zhen et al 2012a c the concentrations of persulfate for the experiments were 0 20 0 40 0 80 and 1 20 mmol g vs of was and the corresponding concentrations of fe2 or fe0 were 0 25 0 50 1 00 and 1 50 mmol g vs of was the mixture was continuously agitated for at least 20 min at 200 rpm to ensure complete peroxidation the control experiments without using conditioner was also performed for comparison for the purpose of improving the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process several different strategies were further proposed and assessed i the catalyst fe0 was added in one time i e all was added initially or two times i e half was add initially and the left added after 5 min of conditioning ii the was suspensions was first adjusted to acidic conditions i e ph 3 0 by using 5 mol l sulfuric acid solution before the addition of s2o8 2 and fe0 and iii the was ph was adjusted to 3 0 while adding fe0 in two times all the tests were conducted in duplicate and the average values with the standard deviations are reported 2 3 dewaterability and settleability the was dewaterability was evaluated by using vacuum filtration method as described previously zhen et al 2013a a 3 5 cm standard buchner funnel equipped with a diaphragm vacuum pump dap 15 ulvac kiko inc japan and advantec r glass fiber filter gs 25 toyo roshi kaisha ltd japan was employed for this purpose 5 ml of treated was samples was continuously dewatered at the vacuum pressure of 1 5 kg cm2 for 120 s both the filtrate volume and the filtration time were computed at predetermined time intervals to visualize the dewatering kinetics of the was the dry solids content as a function of filtration time was then calculated and used to indicate the dewaterability of was sludge volume sv was also measured to assess the sludge settleability 2 4 eps extraction and analysis three types of eps fractions including slime eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted following the successive extraction protocols detailed before li and yang 2007 zhen et al 2013a firstly was samples was centrifuged 8000 g

vortex genie 2 scientific industries inc usa for 1 min followed by centrifugation 8000 g for 10 min at 4 c to collect lb eps the bottom pellets were re suspended using nacl solution and then heat treated in a water bath at 60 c for 30 min tb eps was separated through centrifugation 8000 g for 15 min at 4 c the eps samples filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe driven filter millipore co usa was

statistical analysis was carried out using the software sigmaplot 12 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 was dewatering performance catalyst fe2 vs fe0 effects of catalyst iron species fe2 vs fe0 and s2o8

and fe0 as the catalyst possessed quite different dewatering behaviors s2o8 2 fe2 process had a considerable impact on the dewatering efficiency and kinetics of was fig 1a the application of fe2 led to a shorter time of dewatering and higher dry solids content and the dry solids content increased with the applied s2o8 2 fe2 dosages the dry solids content of was approached the platform of 3 2 0 3 wt after only 30 s of mechanical filtration at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 0 2 0 25 mmol g vs it further climbed up to 4 3 0 3 wt at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 0 8 1 0 mmol g vss and then to 5 1 0 8 wt 30 s when s2o8 2 fe2 dosages were increased to 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs whereas the dry solids content for the untreated was i e 0 0 0 0 mmol g vs at this moment remained comparatively low being 1 8 0 1 wt p 0 05 in order to achieve the similar dry solids content it had to take another roughly 90 s for filtration filtration time is a critical factor governing the mechanical dewatering cost the shortened dewatering time undoubtedly would reduce was treatment cost considerably the corresponding percentages of water removed from treated was suspensions after 30 s of dewatering were in the range of 72 7 2 9 82 7 2 9 while it was 51 5 1 4 fig 1b the observations verified the great effectiveness of s2o8 2 fe2 process in enhancing water removal as well as solids liquid separation agreeing well with our and other findings kim et al 2016 ren et al 2015 shi et al 2015b zhen et al 2012c 2013a in sharp contrast the influence of the persulfate oxidation when activated with fe0 on sludge dewaterability seemed statistically insignificant p 0 05 fig 1c as can be seen even though s2o8 2 fe0 dosages were elevated to the maximum of 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs the increase in dry solids content was still negligible i e 2 0 0 0 wt at 30 s moreover the values of water removed kept consistently low irrespective of the used s2o8 2 fe0 dosages fig 1d it has been well documented that the main mechanism for sludge dewatering in this process relies upon the generation of powerful sulfate radicals so4 eq 1 which induces sludge cells lysis and the release of bound water zhen et al 2012a low enhancement of dewaterability in this scenario implied that fe0 was less comparable with fe2 to initiate persulfate decomposition this is not surprising since fe0 usually needs to dissolve before reaction with s2o8 2 eqs 2 4 hence the dewatering efficiency was hardly promoted the results were in line with those of zhou et al 2015 who noticed that the effect of s2o8 2 fe0 on was dewatering was limited and the reduction percentage of cst was 50 even when the addition of s2o8 2 fe0 was ca 2 2 40 6 mmol g vs differently song et al 2016b highlighted the positive roles of this process in conditioning anaerobically digested sludge and attained the up to 90 cst reduction at ca 2 4 48 2 mmol g vs presumably due to the rupture and biodegradation of sludge eps cells throughout fermentation this reflected that the performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process was very unstable and closely related to sludge properties dewatering efficiencies of s2o8 2 fe0 process might differ greatly with the properties and origins of studied sludges note that this is not the case for s2o8 2 fe2 process and it always gives highly promoted dewatering efficiency regardless of sludge types characteristics and sources shi et al 2015b song et al 2016a zhen et al 2012a 3 2 release of fe2 in fe0 corrosion process fe ion fe2 3 concentration of was filtrate can be an indicator reflecting the internal oxidizing abilities as illustrated in fig 2 a when ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 4h2o was used as the catalyst donor a sufficient fe2 could be provided the measured concentration rose from 49 0 1 3 to 241 7 21 6 mg l while s2o8 2 fe2 dosages were increased from 0 4 0 5 to 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs in comparison the liberation of fe ion in s2o8 2 fe0 system was rate limiting and time consuming despite that the dissolved iron from fe0 gradually increased with s2o8 2 fe2 dosages the maximum value was 46 0 2 5 mg l at 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs still around 6 1 lower than that measured at 0 4 0 5 mmol g vs in s2o8 2 fe2 system p 0 0270 0 05 the corresponding dissolution degree of fe0 in this situation was only 65 4 2 4 mg g fe0 indicating that most of fe0 particles added was not dissolved and utilized efficiently this was mainly caused by the formation of the oxide iron layer consisting of fe2 3 phase near the fe0 metallic core and fe3 oxide near the oxide water interface su et al 2015 which resulted in the slow corrosion and fe2 liberation and or hindered the contact of fe0 with s2o8 2 eq 7 moreover a myriad of complex gel like biopolymers in was flocs tended to further passivate the fe0 particles it is also reported that fe0 is capable of activating s2o8 2 to produce so4 in a direct way that does not involve the dissolved fe2 eq 7 oh et al 2010 thus to determine the importance of each iron species the correlation between fe2 0 content and dry solids content obtained 30 s filtration was established fig 2b it is clear that was dewaterability exhibited a highly significant positive correlation with fe2 content r 0 882 p 0 05 for measured fe2 r 0 962 p 0 01 for applied fe2 dosage however no clear correlation with fe0 dosage existed r 0 579 p 0 05 meanwhile because of low corrosion rate the dissolved fe2 content was too low to exert any effect on dewatering r 0 529 p 0 05 it could be inferred from the above discussion that s2o8 2 was mainly activated by fe2 in s2o8 2 fe2 or s2o8 2 fe0 process rather than fe0 low fe2 available in s2o8 2 fe0 system restricted the sulfate radical generation as a result of which the dewaterability of was even after pretreated was still poor fig 1c obviously the rapid surface inactivation and the slow corrosion of fe0 particles were the limiting steps of was dewatering by s2o8 2 fe0 in another study xiong and his colleagues also confirmed that orange g removal by s2o8 2 fe0 was limited by the fe2 release step xiong et al 2014 7 2s2o8 2 fe0 2so4 fe2 2so4 2 furthermore high addition and low utilization rate of fe0 will discount the reliability and feasibility of this option which ultimately limits its wide applications in real world scenarios thus fe0 can hardly substitute for ferrous salts as the catalyst for persulfate based was dewatering in addition high fe0 residues that is retained within was flocs makes the subsequent sludge treatment and disposal more difficult and costlier as well although the undissolved fe0 can be recycled as done by several researchers song et al 2016b zhou et al 2014 2015 it is still unable to compensate the expense invested for its recovery thereby making s2o8 2 fe0 process less cost effective 3 3 was flocs characteristics and their correlations with dewatering performance 3 3 1 ph variations over conditioning time fig 3 shows the ph variations over time in s2o8 2 fe2 0 systems in s2o8 2 fe2 system fig 3a the ph of was suspensions dropped greatly within the first 1 min of conditioning and thereafter it kept stable until the termination of experimental run the reduction in ph increased with the applied s2o8 2 fe2 dosages dropping from the initial 7 0 to 6 3 at 0 2 0 25 mmol g vs and then to 3 0 at 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs a similar phenomenon was also documented by liang et al 2003 in the thermally activated persulfate system for trichloroethylene tce degradations the reduced ph could be ascribed to the release of h from the decomposition of persulfate li et al 2017 and the production of small molecular weight organic acids due to the oxidation of organic compounds by the so4 liang et al 2003 oh et al 2010 meanwhile the hydrolysis of produced fe3 and the interconversion of so4 to ho following eqs 8 10 could also generate h or consume oh liang and su 2009 resulting in a drop in ph dogliotti and hayon 1967 xiong et al 2014 lower ph revealed the production of more sulfate radicals and the occurrence of stronger oxidizing reactions these observations demonstrated that the activation of s2o8 2 by the added fe2 was very rapid which produced the plenty of so4 and consequently promoted was dewaterability immediately 8 fe3 xh2o fe oh x 3 x xh 9 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 at all phs 10 so4 oh ho so4 2 at alkaline phs for s2o8 2 fe0 system the ph at the various initial s2o8 2 fe0 dosages maintained relatively unchangeable close to natural condition around 7 0 fig 3b the difference in ph variations suggested that the reactions of two s2o8 2 fe2 0 systems with was proceeded in different patterns as verified in section 3 2 fe0 was the source of fe2 in s2o8 2 fe0 system and whether the fe0 can catalyze s2o8 2 into so4 closely depended upon the fe2 liberation rate before activating s2o8 2 fe0 would react with o2 h2o or h to generate fe2 as well as oh in accordance with eqs 2 and 3 increasing the solution ph li et al 2017 oh et al 2010 the increase in ph would be offset subsequently by the released h organic acids or the consumption of oh as noted in s2o8 2 fe2 process in this way the variations of ph were slight li et al 2017 also observed the similar results in degradation of p nitrophenol by fe0 permanganate pm s2o8 2 system however on the basis of low fe ion concentration and poor was dewaterability it should be highlighted that the above mentioned reactions inducing ph variations along with so4 production and conversion might have happened very weakly due to the slow fe0 corrosion this might be the core reason responsible for the stable ph level 3 3 2 was disintegration and simultaneous oxidizing degradation of the released substances fig 4 shows the changes in cod solubilization and ammonia release after 20 min of pretreatment using two s2o8 2 fe2 0 systems overall the scod concentration rose with the s2o8 2 fe2 0 dosages fig 4a indicating the provoked was disintegration solubilization and release of intercellular substances it has been well recognized that eps and cell envelope are the critical elements limiting sludge dewatering as they control the integrity and colloidal stability of the was flocs as well as the water binding capacity hence the good was dewatering will be accompanied with the effective destruction of eps and cell envelope an interesting phenomenon observed herein was that the measured scod in the case of s2o8 2 fe2 process was significantly lower than those obtained by s2o8 2 fe0 process p 0 05 this observation was sharp contrast to the dewatering outcomes illustrated in fig 1 in which it has been demonstrated that s2o8 2 fe2 process was highly superior to s2o8 2 fe0 process in promoting was dewatering actually those results were not conflicting and could be expected as well the scod obtained herein only represented the remaining soluble organics after secondary oxidization but not the all released during the pretreatment massive sulfate radicals produced from s2o8 2 fe2 process are strong and reactive oxidants thereby they cannot only cause the rupture of eps and cells as well as the release of extracellular and intercellular substances but simultaneously non selectively mineralize the extracted organic components via one electron oxidation pathway kim et al 2016 likewise the study carried out by oncu and co workers reported that the utilization of s2o8 2 fe2 clearly resulted in oxidation of the organic matters in sludge as demonstrated by decreases in both scod and tcod oncu et al 2015 in comparison the secondary mineralization of eluted organics seemed un happen because of low level of so4 in s2o8 2 fe0 system several lines of researches even corroborated that the oxidized organic matters produce an organic radical which further stimulates the decomposition of more s2o8 2 into so4 and the degradation of organics edwards and gallopo 1971 kim et al 2016 as a result the scod left in the filtrate undoubtedly tended to be sufficiently abased in literature the disintegration degree ddscod is calculated as the ratio between scod increase by modification and tcod and is normally applied to express the was solubilization efficiency of one pretreatment method zhen et al 2014a in this context it will be unsuitable for this scenario fig 4b shows the ammonia nh4 results ammonia is another valuable parameter indicating was solubilization the released intercellular organic nitrogen from the lysed bacterial cells are non enzymatically degraded into peptides and amino acids and finally carboxylic acids and nh4 kim et al 2016 li et al 2013 resulting in higher ammonia concentration of interest the nh4 outcomes displayed a tendency similar to scod the s2o8 2 fe2 system did not produce a higher nh4 concentration in spite of the great enhancement in was dewatering being 105 0 127 0 mg l as compared with 77 0 126 0 mg l for s2o8 2 fe0 process this was because in addition to the capability of decomposing organic nitrogen into ammonia the excess sulfate radicals were able to gain electrons from the reductive ammonia nitrogen nh3 and nh4 and converted them into no2 n no3 n and even n2 a higher valence state deng and ezyske 2011 a similar outcome was reported by ren et al 2015 who indicated that no3 n was the major component of nh4 n oxidation deng and ezyske 2011 also employed sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process to treat a mature landfill leachate and achieved 90 of cod and ammonia removal the concurrent removal of cod and ammonia nh4 from was filtrate would lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and thus reduce operational expense the results presented in fig s1 in supplementary material also indicated that the was conditioned by s2o8 2 fe2 process produced lower dry solids this is very important in consideration of the subsequent management transportation and ultimate disposal e g anaerobic digestion landfill incineration compost etc hence from an environmental and economic perspective the s2o8 2 fe2 system possesses much greater promise for was dewatering 3 3 3 change in particle size of was flocs fig 5 depicts the variations of was floc size the s2o8 2 fe2 0 processes decreased the particle size and the decrease was magnified with the increased oxidant dosages moreover the influence by s2o8 2 fe2 process was comparatively pronounced indicating much harsher disintegration to sludge flocs the so4 oxidatively broken up the rigid and swollen gel networks surrounding was zoogloea as well as the cell envelope and destabilized the flocs steric structure thereby causing the collapse of was flocs and the decrease in particle size thus the size of was exhibited a perceptible downshift the similar results were also confirmed in our zhen et al 2012a b c and other publications kim et al 2016 ren et al 2015 applying s2o8 2 fe2 process as a pretreatment method to modify sludge to date there still have been an inconsistence with the effect of particle size on was dewatering in general large flocs relate with good dewaterability and rapid solid liquid separation however the was with the decreased particle size herein was characterized by high dewaterability in fact the effective rupture of was flocs was favorable to sludge dewatering this is because so4 mineralized the extracellular biopolymers located on the flocs surface such as proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances which could damage the hydrophilic groups and water bonds such as oh and nh bonds and reduce the water holding capability of flocs facilitating the release of bound water and solid water separation meanwhile the disintegration of was flocs might also create more passages for water removal more importantly the powerful destruction in addition to inducing the reduction in particle size benefited the liberation of plenty of cells trapped within sludge and the subsequent lysis as a consequence the water of hydration bound inside the cells was released into the liquid phase which conduced to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability this was in line with those of wang et al 2017 who achieved a sludge with the reduced particle size but significantly promoted dewaterability after hydrothermal treatment regarding the floc size according to mikkelsen 2001 the supracolloidal flocs in the range of 0 5 5 μm primary particles had the most adverse impact on was dewaterability and the dewaterability deteriorated with the increase of the quantities of flocs in this size range although the application of s2o8 2 fe2 process caused the breakage of sludge flocs and the increase in fine particles the fe3 from the s2o8 2 fe2 system serving as coagulants could absorb onto the negatively charged sludge flocs and agglomerate the smaller particles via charge neutralization absorption bridging and precipitation catching liu et al 2012 promoting the re flocculation of the fine flocs zhen et al 2012a the particle size of the treated was still mainly fell within the range of 40 μm far larger than the size range of primary particles the insert a in fig 5 in this way the impact associated with the particle size variations on dewaterability was almost negligible the two step mechanisms advanced oxidation and fe3 re flocculation were also hypothesized by zhen et al 2012a with s2o8 2 fe2 system and yu et al 2016 with h2o2 fe2 process in conditioning sewage sludge 3 3 4 was settling behavior after 20 min of conditioning fig s2 in supplementary material compares the settleability of the was samples pretreated at different conditions as stated before owing to the relatively limited influence on the particle size change s2o8 2 fe2 0 processes in the current study did not affect the sludge settling behaviors and there was no any relationship observed between settling characteristics and the generated fe ion r 0 024 p 0 947 0 05 the was had extremely poor settleability regardless of the types of catalyst and s2o8 2 fe2 0 dosages in agreement with the findings in our previous work with s2o8 2 fe2 to condition sludge zhen et al 2013a the principle reason for that is still less known and remains to be well recognized in addition no clear correlation was detected between the settling behavior and dewaterability r 0 694 p 0 194 0 05 for s2o8 2 fe2 r 0 697 p 0 191 0 05 for s2o8 2 fe0 uncovering that the sludge with high dewaterability does not necessarily exhibit satisfactory settleability was is a multiphase medium containing water mineral and organic substances microorganism cells and eps etc and its dewatering has been reported to be controlled by many physicochemical parameters mikkelsen and keiding 2002 you et al 2017 in other words although the sludge dewatering can be reinforced by improving set settleability in theory this is probably not a critical factor governing the dewaterability in addition the results shown in fig s3 in supplementary material reveal that the was viscosity fell within a range of around 76 5 112 5 mpa s which exhibited clear correlation with dewaterability r 0 781 p 0 029 0 05 consistent with the results of jin et al 2004 li and yang 2007 and zhen et al 2012c the was flocs with high viscosity had low ability to dewater 3 3 5 re distribution and concurrent mineralization of different eps fractions the eps is one of the critical governing factors with respect to the was dewaterability the s2o8 2 fe2 pretreatment had a profound effect on the distribution of eps as seen from fig 6 a the total eps content i e pn ps in lb eps and tb eps fractions exhibited a stepwise decrease with increasing s2o8 2 fe2 dosages whereas it was slightly increased in s eps the initial eps content in s eps lb eps and tb eps fractions for the raw was was 5 26 6 43 and 22 06 mg g vs respectively it dramatically declined to 20 33 mg g vs for tb eps fraction when s2o8 2 fe2 dosages were elevated to 0 4 0 5 mmol g vs decreasing by 7 8 the corresponding s eps value climbed up to 9 57 mg g vs increasing by 81 9 the decrease in bound eps in particular tb eps accompanied with increase in s eps fraction reflected a fact that s2o8 2 fe2 process effectively dissolved the bound eps and transferred them into the liquid thus increasing the s eps level to some degree with further increasing s2o8 2 fe2 dosages to 0 8 1 0 mmol g vs the lb eps and tb eps dropped sharply to 2 60 and 4 01 mg g vs drops of roughly 62 2 and 80 3 respectively when compared with s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 0 4 0 5 mmol g vs moreover the s eps decreased as well by 25 2 the observations coincided well with the cod profile fig 4a reconfirming that the s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation not only was capable of dissolving the lb eps and tb eps but also was able to completely mineralize the extracted bound eps in sharp contrast the effect of s2o8 2 fe0 system was comparatively slight the eps content did not change substantially until the imposed s2o8 2 fe0 dosages reached 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs even that the solubilization of tb eps in this scenario still kept extremely low what was worse the released eps were mostly retained in the s eps fraction in place of oxidizing degradation owing to the lacking of sufficient so4 fig 6b eps have a high affinity for water and are highly hydrated with water content up to 98 jin et al 2004 the sludge with high eps content thus has high difficulty with dewatering the greatly oxidized eps provided the clear evidence for faster water seepage as noticed in the presence of high s2o8 2 fe2 dosages during mechanical filtration fig 1 due to the difference in spatial locations within was flocs the role of each eps fraction in was dewatering often differs the experimental data indicated the poor correlation between the was dewaterability determined by the dry solids content of the dewatered sludge with the individual biopolymers pn and ps as well as the total eps in s eps fraction r 0 289 p 0 450 0 05 for pn r 0 355 p 0 348 0 05 for ps r 0 087 p 0 824 0 05 for total eps fig 6c s eps located in the liquid phase of sludge were easily separated with free water by mechanical filtration and thus hardly affected was dewaterability due to chemical cross linking and physical entanglement effect arising from high molecular weight biopolymers present in s eps matrix s eps fraction was considered to be more crucial in controlling sludge viscosity and settleability zhen et al 2013a in comparison the contribution of lb eps to the dewatering performance appeared to be greater the dewaterability corresponded oppositely to the individual pn and the total eps in extracted lb eps fraction r 0 871 p 0 002 0 05 for pn r 0 787 p 0 012 0 05 for total eps while weakly correlating with the ps r 0 206 p 0 594 0 05 fig 6d lb eps diffusing from the surface of was flocs to the water solution are highly porous and dispersive li and yang 2007 and an effective breakdown of lb eps reduces the relative hydrophobicity of the sludge and benefits water removal resulting in an increase in was dewatering performance the most remarkable effect was then identified for tb eps the was dewaterability had a closer negative correlation with the amounts of each biopolymer and total eps measured in tb eps fraction r 0 818 p 0 007 0 05 for pn r 0 689 p 0 007 0 05 for ps r 0 791 p 0 011 0 05 for total eps fig 6e hinting the particularly crucial role of tb esp in was dewatering to date there is a consensus on the role of lb eps whereas the statements associated with tb eps are still more or less contradictory the current observation matched well with our and other previous works ye et al 2012 zhen et al 2012a 2013a but somewhat conflicted with the findings obtained by li and yang 2007 and yu et al 2017 who highlighted that lb eps were more influential with respect to sludge sedimentation and biomass water separation than tb eps the discrepancy might be in part attributable to the differences in eps extraction methods and pretreatment techniques investigated additionally according to the previous reports by zhou et al 2001 and yuan et al 2014 it was found that the conventional mechanical dewatering techniques could only remove the water in s eps and lb eps this implied that the real difficulty to dewater for was might more lie in the presence of a large quantity of tb eps and cells enmeshed in the gel like matrix the cells carry an abundant amount of hydration water 3 wt of total water and the water cannot be removed unless the cell walls are broken down tb eps located in the inner layers of the was flocs are tightly adhered to the cell wall apart from bringing an amount of bound water into the aggregates the presence of tb eps could also restrict the lysis of cells and subsequent release of intracellular water by functioning as the protective shell accordingly the adequate breakdown of gel like tb eps matrix is a critical requisite for the removal of both eps held water and cell water which would be the major cause for the great enhancement of was dewaterability obtained by s2o8 2 fe2 system 3 4 key composition and structure of organic matters related to was dewatering xps measurements were utilized to unravel the chemical changes for c n and o elements on the surface of was flocs before and after pretreatment the high resolution xps spectra at c 1s shows the appearance of four main c containing species fig 7 the typical peaks at 284 5 and 286 1 ev corresponded to aliphatic aromatic carbon c c c h and c c dai et al 2017 and carbon bounded as c o and c n amide i respectively castillo et al 2016 the peak at 287 5 ev was assigned to o c nh bond of amino acid dai et al 2017 which was also identified in the o 1s high resolution spectrum peak at 532 3 ev this peak also correlated with the n 1s high resolution region which shows the appearance of two peaks at 399 6 and 400 8 ev resulting from the n of amino acid the peak at 288 5 ev was linked to o c o bond of the carboxyl acids the peaks at 530 8 and 531 5 ev were characteristic of oxygen bounded as o h and c o castillo et al 2016 wen et al 2014 respectively the predominant components in was matrixes are protein and polysaccharide with smaller amounts of dna lipids etc the peaks indicated by c c c h c n c o and o c nh provided the direct evidence for the existence of protein zhen et al 2012b zhu et al 2012 and the peaks related to o h and c o the two most common functional groups in carbohydrate mecozzi and pietrantonio 2006 reflected the carbohydrate from the results in figure it was clear that three elements spectra were quite different after pretreatment as compared to the raw was fig 7a the relative intensities of those peaks in the was sample treated by s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation displayed a dramatic drop fig 7b which provided the information on the degradation of protein and carbohydrate however the decrease caused by s2o8 2 fe0 oxidation was comparatively low in accordance to the eps results fig 6 it has been proved that the interactions of the biopolymers i e protein and carbohydrate with hydrogen bond such as oh and nh bonds contribute greatly to the water binding properties jin et al 2004 the breakage of the water bonds by electrophilic attack by so4 radicals from s2o8 2 fe2 process altered the physical properties in particular water holding capacity of was flocs and thus caused the promotion of the dewaterability 3 5 characterization of floc morphology by sem along with eds mapping the apparent morphology of the was treated at various conditions was characterized through sem eds analysis to verify the underlying dewatering mechanisms fig 8 before pretreatment fig 8a well defined flocs similar to those observed in was samples liu et al 2016c yu et al 2017 zhen et al 2013a were observed a number of cocci and rod shaped microbial cells embedded within or closely interlacing with the gel like eps matrix were identified clearly the intimate cross link of eps cell induced a compact and glutinous structure giving rise to the poor was dewaterability the microstructure however underwent extensive transformation when subject to s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation and the eps cell complex was definitely disrupted fig 8b well corresponding to the results of eps fig 6 and xps examination fig 7 due to the collapse of the protective eps layer most of the unentrapped cells have already been severally fragmented under the stress of powerful so4 radicals visible cracks arose on cell surface and very few cells left kept intact showcasing the effective breakage of cells the cracks could serve as water channels allowing much more release of intracellular materials see carbon eds mapping in fig 8b and cell water into the free water and finally improving the water transport and separation the aforesaid observations consisted well with the results of our previous studies zhen et al 2012b 2013a based upon the above observations the two step dewatering mechanisms for s2o8 2 fe2 process could be proposed as follows i the disruption of eps cell chains and the escape of entrapped cells and ii the sludge cells lysis and the seepage of bulk water molecules comparatively the flocs treated with s2o8 2 fe0 process showed the morphology similar to the raw sludge fig 8c the eps cell complex still remained intact and regular and no any observable change occurred due to the less production of so4 caused by the low dissolution rate of fe0 as illustrated by eds mapping the distribution of iron in fe0 fed flocs was relatively uneven in sharp contrast with the high homogeneity in fe2 fed was flocs the signal of iron was strong in some areas but very weak in others unraveling that the majority of added fe0 particles kept undissolved and unused in accordance with the findings in fig 2a eps interlaced with cells closely sustaining a highly hydrated and integrated flocs so the was in the presence of s2o8 2 fe0 presented a high eps content fig 6b and poor dewaterability fig 1c once again proving the less promise of using fe0 as the catalyst to activate persulfate for sludge dewatering evidently the proper choice of iron catalysts fe2 or fe0 is very important for the enhancement of was dewaterability in order to visualize the discrepancy in the catalyzing behaviors and the roles in enhancing was dewaterability of two iron catalysts the underlying principles were proposed and are illustrated in fig 9 3 6 strategies to improve the s2o8 2 fe0 performance in enhancing was dewatering as confirmed in the above mentioned results the dissolution of fe0 particles is rate limiting step in s2o8 2 fe0 based dewatering process thus for the purpose of improving the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 process several strategies i e prolonged pretreatment time adding way of fe0 ph adjustment to 3 0 or combination of ph adjustment with increased addition times were explored and evaluated as can be seen in fig 10 a prolonging conditioning time could increase the was dewatering performance but the enhancement was statistically insignificant p 0 4226 0 05 with dry solids content increasing from 2 0 0 0 to only 2 3 0 3 wt after 30 s filtration the remarkable promotion was noticed while adding fe0 in two times p 0 01 dry solids content correspondingly arose to around 3 0 0 0 wt this result was in well agreement with the previous findings of yan et al 2011 who used fe3o4 nanoparticles as the initiator of persulfate in treating sulfamonomethoxine smm and reported that the addition of the nanoparticles in several times could enhance the system performance with the degradation efficiency of smm increasing from 36 5 to 46 9 adding fe0 in several times could to a certain degree avoid the too quick inactivation of metallic surface whereas the value in this scenario was still incomparable with the one obtained by s2o8 2 fe2 system i e 5 1 0 8 wt p 0 05 another strategy was to adjust initial ph to 3 0 the acidic condition could favor the corrosion of fe0 metallic surface promoting the release of more fe2 that could activate the persulfate kallel et al 2009 indeed the ph adjustment has enhanced the dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe0 system with the dry solids content being up to 3 5 0 4 wt roughly 75 0 higher than s2o8 2 fe0 alone p 0 05 the corresponding percentages of water removed approached 74 7 2 9 fig 10b li et al 2017 developed a fe0 permanganate pm s2o8 2 system to decompose the p nitrophenol and also confirmed that the acidic ph was more favorable over neutral and alkaline conditions in cod removal the enhancement was further verified by the greatly accelerated corrosion rate of fe0 particles and the measured fe ion concentration as well as the dissolution degree of fe0 were elevated to 60 2 1 3 mg l and 86 7 1 2 mg g fe0 respectively fig 11 a low ph facilitates the abrasion of passive oxide iron layer which favored the localized corrosion and thus corrosion was accelerated subsequently as a result of this more so4 were successfully generated which decomposed the hydrophilic bonds in eps matrix fig s4 in supplementary material and fig 11b broken apart the cells fig s5 in supplementary material and subsequently aroused the enhancement in was dewaterability in another study using fe0 persulfate for the removal of organic g og xiong et al 2014 also attributed the increased og removal in low ph to the larger fe0 corrosion and the consequent greater so4 generation rate furthermore coupling ph 3 0 with two time s addition could further strengthen this impact unfortunately the combined process still failed in competing with s2o8 2 fe2 system for sludge dewatering indicating that this strategy was unsatisfactory either previously several other attempts have been also proposed to enhance the active dissolution of fe0 such as coupling with weak magnetic field xiong et al 2014 electrolysis electrocoagulation li et al 2016 etc nonetheless the ph adjustment increasing addition time or combination with other options may inevitably complicate the conditioning and dewatering processes increasing operating cost which severely restricts its commercial implementations in real world scenario therefore more works are still necessarily required prior to considering the real applications of s2o8 2 fe0 in place of s2o8 2 fe2 in wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that two iron catalysts i e fe2 vs fe0 displayed the different catalyzing behaviors for the decomposition of persulfate and was dewatering in terms of was dewaterability the fe2 exhibited a higher effectiveness than fe0 the dry solids content of treated was after only 30 s filtration reached up to 5 1 0 8 wt at s2o8 2 fe2 dosages of 1 2 1 5 mmol g vs increasing by 1 8 folds than raw was 1 8 0 1 wt whereas the increase in was dewaterability was very slight i e the highest dry solids content of 2 0 0 0 wt while fe0 was employed as the catalyst additional analysis demonstrated that lb eps and in particular tb eps were the key factors governing was dewaterability the abundant so4 from s2o8 2 fe2 system could effectively disrupt the gel like eps matrix break apart the cells and arouse the release of the water inside eps and cells facilitating water solid separation in the case of s2o8 2 fe0 the dissolution of fe0 particles was the rate limiting step due to the formation of oxide iron layer near fe0 metallic surface which resulted in the slow so4 production and thus hardly promoted was dewaterability more importantly except for enhancing was dewatering s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation could also concurrently degrade cod and ammonia from was filtrate lighten the burden of the subsequent sewage treatment facilities and reduce operational expense this indicated that the proper choice of the iron catalysts is one of the most crucial matters for the enhancement of was dewaterability from an environmental and economic perspective the s2o8 2 fe2 system will hold a much greater promise for

19696,current guidelines for testing drinking water quality recommend that the sampling rate which is the number of samples tested for fecal indicator bacteria fib per year increases as the population served by the drinking water system increases however in low resource settings prevalence of contamination tends to be higher potentially requiring higher sampling rates and different statistical methods not addressed by current sampling recommendations we analyzed 27 930 tests for fib collected from 351 piped water systems in eight countries in sub saharan africa to assess current sampling rates observed contamination prevalences and the ability of monitoring agencies to complete two common objectives of sampling programs determine regulatory compliance and detect a change over time although fib were never detected in samples from 75 of piped water systems only 14 were sampled often enough to conclude with 90 confidence that the true contamination prevalence met an example guideline 5 chance of any sample positive for fib similarly after observing a ten percentage point increase in contaminated samples 43 of pws would still require more than a year before their monitoring agency could be confident that contamination had actually increased we conclude that current sampling practices in these settings may provide insufficient information because they collect too few samples we also conclude that current guidelines could be improved by specifying how to increase sampling after contamination has been detected our results suggest that future recommendations should explicitly consider the regulatory limit and desired confidence in results and adapt when fib is detected keywords sampling programs microbial water quality guidelines for drinking water quality sub saharan africa statistical uncertainty water quality regulations 1 introduction while more than 2 6 billion people have gained access to an improved water source over the last 25 years recent evidence suggests that many of these improved sources do not provide drinking water that is safe onda et al 2012 bain et al 2014a shaheed et al 2014 who and unicef 2015 measurements of water quality are important for managing and controlling water safety and tracking progress to national and global targets such as the sustainable development goals who and unicef 2014 2017 water management agencies around the world sample microbial drinking water quality to assess whether systems provide water that minimizes risks to health rahman et al 2011 peletz et al 2016 water quality can be monitored for regulatory or operational purposes regulatory or verification monitoring is performed to ensure that a water supply meets standards while operational monitoring is used to assess operations and detect changes in performance who 2011 however collecting samples and testing water quality can be expensive time consuming and logistically complicated crocker and bartram 2014 wright et al 2014 bain et al 2014b peletz et al 2016 many countries in sub saharan africa ssa have adopted or adapted the recommendations in the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq for the design of their sampling program peletz et al 2016 in practice many water management agencies in ssa conduct some testing but have not tested enough samples to meet the gdwq recommendations for the number of samples tested peletz et al 2016 therefore optimizing testing is a priority particularly in low resource settings where testing activities are constrained and the prevalence of contamination tends to be higher previous research on improving the efficacy of sampling has focused on piped supplies in high income countries that have generous information about their network e g historical data pipe maps reliably continuous water supply and infrequent contamination speight et al 2004 grayman et al 2007 van lieverloo et al 2007 horowitz 2013 rosen et al 2009 however corresponding analyses on improving the effectiveness of sampling in middle and low income countries which often have limited system data unreliable supplies and frequent contamination have not been performed lee and schwab 2005 to account for the higher prevalence of contamination more frequent sampling and different statistical methods may be necessary current sampling recommendations do not address this possibility sampling plans should achieve the goals of a monitoring program while balancing accuracy of results with ease of application and understanding the gdwq recommend a minimum number of samples for fib be tested annually for regulatory monitoring who 2011 the 2011 gdwq substantially increased sampling in very large systems where budgets and health risks may both be larger and switched from monthly to yearly targets which may decrease operational costs as compared to previous editions of the gdwq who 1993 2008 the gdwq also recommend that none of the tested samples should be found positive for fib who 2011 standards such as these which focus on the allowable number of positive samples are easy to implement and understand but their statistical power cannot be evaluated however in practice standards that allow no positive samples are indistinguishable from high percentile standards e g 1 chance of detecting fib in any sample whose statistical power we can assess ellis 1989 similarly hunter 2002 compared assessing compliance of bathing water with regulations using a threshold approach 95 of samples complying with water quality standards to using a percentile approach the 95th percentile of observed values should not exceed the water quality standard and found that the percentile method complicated the calculation without changing the regulatory decision while sampling programs should consider resource and logistical constraints it is also important to have confidence in the accuracy of the information obtained from a water quality monitoring program as false positives could lead to expending resources unnecessarily and false negatives could result in detrimental health consequences we analyze what can be learned from past monitoring programs that tested piped water quality in ssa by evaluating each system s 1 sampling rate and contamination prevalence 2 ability to assess compliance against a regulatory limit and 3 ability to detect changes in water quality over time our aim is to identify how to increase the effectiveness of sampling recommendations for piped water systems in low resource settings we use these results to inform our recommendations for improving current sampling practices and guidelines 2 methods 2 1 data collection water quality data were collected as part of the monitoring for safe water mfsw program from eight countries in ssa benin ethiopia ghana guinea kenya senegal uganda and zambia peletz et al 2013 2016 kumpel et al 2016 a full description of the mfsw program and participating agencies are described in peletz et al 2016 and kumpel et al 2016 sampling and testing of drinking water was conducted by monitoring agencies responsible for regulatory monitoring of water quality these included water suppliers supplier responsible for providing and monitoring piped water and health or water surveillance agencies surveillance responsible for monitoring and ensuring the quality of all water sources in their jurisdiction some information about sampling locations were available for 71 of samples in the database although these include varying levels of detail fig s1 water quality data were collected during two stages of mfsw 1 retrospective data collected from agencies that had applied to mfsw with samples tested between jan 2009 dec 2013 and 2 mfsw supported data collected by participating monitoring agencies every month with samples tested between jul 2013 apr 2015 the average number of samples taken over time sampling rate by a given agency increased during the mfsw program since the program provided financial support and incentives to agencies to reach sampling rate targets peletz et al 2013 therefore the retrospective data represents baseline conditions while the mfsw supported data represents a best case scenario for sampling rate 2 2 statistical model for water quality in a piped water system the microbial quality of piped water varies spatially and temporally throughout a system ellis 1989 geldreich 1996 spatial variations may be introduced by increasing water age consumption of free chlorine or point sources of contamination e g backflow or intrusion similarly temporal variations may be induced by changes in source water quality treatment efficacy system parameters e g flow rates or pressures momentary low pressure events e g from maintenance or pressure transients or time varying contaminant sources e g increased intrusion after rainfall any water quality sample that tests positive for fib provides the utility with specific and conclusive evidence of a problem that existed at a specific time and a specific location in their system however from a regulatory perspective the important question is not the quality of a specific sample at location x and time y but on average the overall safety of the water distributed by this piped water system ellis 1989 ellis 1989 suggests four possible ways to account for the temporal and spatial variability of water quality first by randomizing samples over space and time second by selecting sampling locations representative of average conditions third by selecting sampling locations representative of the worst conditions and finally by modeling the sources and distribution of contamination and adjusting the sampling strategy accordingly volume 3 of the gdwq for community supplies recommends that sampling locations should be representative of the water source treatment plant storage facilities distribution network points at which water is delivered to the consumer and points of use who 1997 more conservatively the 2011 gdwq recommend that samples should be taken at locations with the best possible chance of detecting contamination who 2011 in either case however repeated samples from fixed locations can bias the results cotter 1985 and dramatically so where a sampling agency takes action to address contamination after it is detected unfortunately it was not possible to verify how sampling agencies selected sampling locations further as sampling locations were not uniformly repeated or randomized credibly accounting for the spatial variations in the samples was beyond the scope of this work the primary drivers of temporal variations are seasonally and weather dependent both of which are geographically dependent given the geographic dispersion in our dataset accounting for climatic and weather phenomena was beyond the scope of this work therefore as a starting point for more refined statistical models in the future and following with analyses conducted in high income contexts ellis 1989 cotter 1985 we combine temporal and spatial sources of variance specifically we model sampling a piped water system at any time or place as a bernoulli trial with a fixed probability of detecting or failing to detect fib functionally this is equivalent to modeling each piped water system as a unique continuously stirred reactor 2 3 definitions 2 3 1 piped water systems pws networked water systems were sampled and tested by various monitoring agencies water suppliers or surveillance agencies the water quality results were then often reviewed and evaluated by water quality technicians operators or management in the monitoring agencies regulators benchmarking institutions and other stakeholders kumpel et al 2016 for this analysis we define a piped water system pws as a networked water system in a village town or city that was tested by one monitoring agency supplier or surveillance whose data were either entirely in the retrospective database or entirely in the mfsw supported database this definition meets two goals 1 to assess how much is known about the performance of individual water systems by each agency that tests them i e we do not pool performance data as sampling agencies would not necessarily have access to the pooled data and 2 to preserve the differences between the two datasets since one represented a baseline condition and the other represented a best case scenario to achieve the first goal we classified the same monitoring agency sampling multiple systems as separate pws e g one monitoring agency sampling two water systems was classified as two separate pws similarly we classified the same water system sampled by different monitoring agencies as separate pws e g the same water system sampled by two monitoring agencies was classified as two separate pws to achieve the second goal if one water system had been sampled by one monitoring agency in both retrospective and mfsw supported datasets we classified it as two separate pws in the analysis finally while we use these data to illustrate the value of data for regulatory and operational scenarios the agencies whose data we analyze were selected non randomly therefore we caution against using the data to interpret the water quality of particular countries peletz et al 2016 2 3 2 contamination prevalence monitoring agencies reported the results of individual water quality samples tested from pws including the date of sample location e g town city or sub district and test results we only included data from sampling points representative of water used for drinking from a piped system i e consumer taps and standpipes we excluded samples from non piped sources and further upstream in a piped distribution system e g raw untreated water water treatment plants and service reservoirs we categorized a result as a test for fecal indicator bacteria fib if the sample was tested for e coli fecal coliform enterococci or h2s or if agencies tested for total coliform and included a confirmation step details in kumpel et al 2016 we define a positive test based on whether a 100 ml sample was positive for fib through a presence absence test or quantitative method e g colony forming units cfu or most probable number mpn we excluded samples from analysis if the method systematically tested a volume less than 100 ml we refer to the percentage of all samples taken from a pws that tested positive for fecal indicator bacteria fib as the observed contamination prevalence specifically due to variance in the number of samples and the spacing of samples the observed contamination prevalence does not consider the time intervals between samples even if nothing about the water quality in a system changes the observed contamination prevalence can fluctuate due to chance e g from one year to the next in keeping with our statistical model we also consider the true contamination prevalence the probability that any sample from a pws would be positive for fib conceptually this can be thought of as the contamination prevalence that would be observed if the pws was randomly sampled a very large number of times the true contamination prevalence of a pws describes the underlying state of the system and does not depend on where or how the system is sampled it only changes when the water quality in the pws changes therefore much of the statistics that follow analyze the difference between the observed and the true contamination prevalences 2 3 3 sampling rates for each pws we calculated the target number of samples tested per year sampling rate for the system as recommended by the who gdwq recommended sampling rate and compared this with the number of samples we observe recorded per year in the dataset observed sampling rate for most pws we had less than one year of data while our observed sampling rates adjusted for this limited observation window our calculations of the statistical uncertainty about a pws contamination prevalence used all available data i e did not adjust for the observation window for pws with more than a year of data this overestimated the certainty available on an annual basis conversely for pws who submitted only a portion of their annual data this underestimated the available certainty about their contamination prevalence in either case by using all available data our method reflects how much regulators could learn about the contamination prevalence in each pws from our dataset recommended for each town or city in the dataset we calculated the recommended minimum annual sampling rate according to the who gdwq 1 12 samples for systems serving 5 000 people 2 12 samples for every 5 000 people for small systems serving 5 000 100 000 people 3 12 samples for every 10 000 people plus 120 samples for systems serving 100 000 500 000 people and 4 12 samples for every 50 000 people plus 600 samples for very large systems 500 000 people who 2011 these sampling rates refer to the number of samples to be tested per year for towns and cities in ethiopia benin and zambia we obtained population data from reports submitted through mfsw peletz et al 2016 for towns and cities in kenya we obtained population data from the water and sanitation regulatory authority wasreb reports wasreb 2012 for towns and cities located in uganda we used the population listed for the town council sub county or district capital from the 2014 housing census data or for those municipalities spread over several administrative units we summed the populations of the relevant administrative units ugandan bureau of statistics 2014 for very small community parish systems in uganda we used the mean parish size for that district or when missing a neighboring district from the 2002 housing census uganda bureau of statistics 2006 since most parishes had populations of 5000 people which results in a constant recommendation of 12 samples per year the gdwq recommended sampling rates did not depend on exact parish populations we were unable to obtain relevant population data for the towns and cities in the dataset from ghana guinea or senegal and therefore pws from these three countries are not included in the analysis presented in section 3 1 which compares the recommended sampling rate to the observed sampling rate often countries have national standards which require a higher sampling rate than the who gdwq peletz et al 2016 however here we consider only the gdwq sampling rate for uniformity observed we calculated the observed annual sampling rate based on the obtained water quality data due to differences in incentives and program structure we accounted for missing data differently in the retrospective and mfsw supported data using retrospective data from samples tested from 2011 to 2013 we calculated the mean monthly sampling rate between the first and the last month of all months for which test results were recorded for each pws since fewer than 12 months of retrospective data were available for many pws this method inflated the sampling rate of pws in the retrospective database that were sampled for only a few consecutive months using mfsw supported data we calculated the mean monthly sampling rate from the first year of mfsw data during the first year all participating pws were supposed to have submitted data we multiplied all mean monthly sampling rates by 12 to obtain annual sampling rates and categorized sampling rates by data source retrospective or mfsw supported 2 4 statistical methods first we aggregated contamination prevalences and observed sampling rates for each pws to understand the range of sampling patterns and observations we then evaluated whether the water quality results from a single pws could be used to 1 determine compliance of a pws with an example regulatory limit regulatory monitoring and 2 detect performance degradation operational monitoring to improve existing recommendations we demonstrated how regulatory limits and sampling rates could be harmonized and quantified how much additional sampling should be required when a given number of samples test positive for fib determining compliance with an example regulatory limit the 2011 who gdwq recommend no samples should be positive for fib we analyze only the stated recommendations and explore the statistical power and limitations of sampling programs that would follow the gdwq under the current gdwq it is easy to determine whether or not a pws has passed the standard however how confident should a monitoring agency be that the pws in question has a true contamination prevalence of for example 5 to facilitate this type of uncertainty analysis we follow ellis 1989 and convert the gdwq into a percentile standard the exact percentile equivalent depends on the number of samples and desired confidence level as a starting point we consider a limit of 5 similar to the limit in the us 1989 total coliform rule for systems testing more than 40 samples in a month specifically we consider two alternative regulatory limits in every pws there should be a 5 chance of detecting fib in any sample with either 75 or 90 confidence these alternative regulatory limits allow us to quantify the uncertainty caused by existing sampling practices and recommended sampling rates since we classified samples tested for fib as positive or negative contained fib or did not contain fib in a 100 ml sample the results were binomially distributed using the observed contamination prevalence for each pws we evaluated the range in which the true contamination prevalence was expected to lie below 90 of the time and the range in which the true contamination prevalence was expected lie above 90 of the time displayed as error bars implemented using the clopper pearson algorithm in r r core team 2016 version 3 2 1 we then used these confidence intervals to classify all pws in the dataset into four categories a confidently with 90 confidence above ca the regulated limit 5 b unconfidently above the limit ua c unconfidently below the limit ub and d confidently below the limit cb fig 1 three evaluation criteria can be used to convert the four classifications into a regulatory verdict of passing or failing benefit of the doubt face value or fail safe ellis 1989 mcbride 2005 the most relaxed is the benefit of the doubt criterion where the true contamination prevalence is assumed to pass the regulated limit unless proved otherwise with the required level of confidence e g passes unless we have 90 confidence the true contamination prevalence is 5 i e only ca fails the most common and current gdwq approach is the face value criterion where the observed contamination prevalence is assumed to be the true contamination prevalence and confidence levels are ignored i e ca and ua fail the standard finally the most conservative is the fail safe criterion where pws are assumed to fail the regulated limit unless proved otherwise with the required level of confidence e g fails unless we have 90 confidence the true contamination prevalence is 5 i e only cb passes the relationship between pws categorization and evaluation criterion is detailed in fig 1 detecting quality degradation while the who gdwq are designed for regulatory monitoring results are also likely to be used by water system operators to make operational decisions and regulators to detect temporal trends we therefore explore how much should be learned from existing sampling practices about changes in water quality as the sampling requirements for operational monitoring are higher we adopt a benefit of the doubt approach determining how long it would take before an operator or regulator could be sure that their pws true contamination prevalence had increased i e water quality has degraded we do not however quantify the probability of failing to detect a genuine change i e type ii error see for e g mcbride 2005 our statistical model treats temporal and spatial variations equivalently therefore this section considers how many samples are required to distinguish between sample sets with observed contamination prevalences that differ for a sampling agency with fixed sampling locations the spatial variation is controlled for and different contamination prevalences could be interpreted as a degradation in water quality over time for an agency with randomized sampling locations the difference in observed contamination prevalences could be induced by temporal or spatial variations nevertheless if each set of samples was taken at randomized locations and at randomized times the difference could still be interpreted as temporally induced with the statistical confidence suggested by the method that follows cotter 1985 we calculated the minimum number of samples required before a large 10 percentage point increase in the observed contamination prevalence of a pws would lead to the conclusion that the pws had actually experienced a degradation in water quality with a given level of statistical confidence to achieve this we modeled each pws as having two sets of samples of equal size each with an unknown true contamination prevalence the first set was taken to have an observed contamination prevalence equal to the one in the dataset the second set was simulated to have an observed contamination prevalence 10 percentage points higher e g from 1 of samples contaminated to 11 or from 85 to 95 the prior assumption about the true contamination prevalence in each set of samples was independent and uniformly distributed from 0 to 100 we used bayesian updating to model how more samples increased the confidence that the observed change was also a true change the specific equations used to calculate the minimum number of required samples using beta distributions and solved numerically are in text s1 the calculated minimum number of samples was converted into a minimum time by dividing the minimum number of samples by the observed sampling rate for each pws strategies for improving sampling recommendations to illustrate how to align sampling recommendations and regulatory limits we calculated the minimum number of samples required to pass a fail safe regulatory limit the most conservative definition fig 1 with a given confidence again using the clopper pearson algorithm depending on the time horizon of study monthly quarterly yearly etc the minimum number of required samples can be converted into a minimum sampling rate by dividing the required number of samples by the time horizon in which data would be assessed e g if 24 samples are required and we want to assess the water quality in every quarter this translates into 96 24 0 25 samples per year the gdwq recommend that no samples be found positive for fib however should a pws be penalized if it is sampled 2 5 times more often than the recommended minimum rate and one sample is found to be positive for fib similarly in a pws in which only a few samples test positive for fib these few samples may not be representative of their pws true contamination prevalence we therefore calculated how many more samples would need to be tested after a contaminated sample was detected to return to the original level of confidence in a pws true contamination prevalence to do so we first quantified the existing confidence in the true contamination prevalence associated with a pws sampled according to the who gdwq and with no samples found positive for fib we then calculated the number of additional samples that must be tested to retrieve the original level of certainty after a given number of samples are found to be positive for fib this calculation was done by increasing the number of samples taken until the upper limit of the new confidence interval was equal or less than the limit without any observed contamination for computational efficiency with large sampling numbers we tested the nearest integer to e 0 01 x x z 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling rates and observed contamination the dataset for analysis included 351 pws representing 270 different distinct areas towns or cities in eight countries of these pws 58 were sampled by surveillance agencies and the remainder by water suppliers table 1 however suppliers took more samples 83 of samples in the dataset were tested by suppliers compared to 17 by surveillance agencies n 27 930 each pws was tested for fib a mean of 80 times range 1 7765 over a mean of 9 6 months range 1 26 table 1 the mean percent of samples positive for fib observed contamination prevalence per pws was 11 5 range 0 100 table 1 the breakdown of pws sizes by country is included as table s1 annual sampling rates per pws ranged from no samples per year to 7168 samples per year with a mean of 76 and a median of 12 table s2 within the subset of samples with location information 71 n 27 930 47 n 349 of pws were repeatedly sampled a mean of two or more times per sampling location or neighborhood fig s1 three country specific observations must be noted first senegal had the highest percent of samples positive for fib in our database at 45 table 1 however data from senegal were gathered entirely by a surveillance agency which was more likely to test in low resourced and rural water supplies which are more likely to be contaminated peletz et al 2016 kumpel et al 2016 second fib were not detected in any samples from any pws in our database from ghana although total coliform not reported as an fib were occasionally detected likely because only three towns were monitored fewer samples were taken relative to other countries and half of samples had detectable free chlorine residual third pws from uganda are heavily represented comprising 56 of the pws in the dataset we performed all analyses both with and without data from uganda where important the results of this sensitivity study are noted we compared the observed sampling rates per pws to the recommended sampling rates calculated from the gdwq fig 2 more pws serving smaller populations met the gdwq recommendations than pws serving larger populations the median sampling rate for pws serving fewer than 10 000 people was 108 of the gdwq recommendation and dropped to 45 for pws serving more than 10 000 people fig 2 while supplier sampling rates generally increased with the size of the population served surveillance sampling rates showed no increasing trend with population served four of the five 80 surveillance agencies monitoring pws that served more than 100 000 people had observed sampling rates lower than 5 of the gdwq recommended rate while surveillance agencies are often responsible for testing every water source in their jurisdiction e g piped systems wells springs in practice they often prioritize testing rural sources over urban piped sources peletz et al 2016 kumpel et al 2016 guidance on sampling rates for surveillance agencies is especially important when they are responsible for verifying the results of a supplier s testing for example the time and resources invested in surveillance agencies testing only a few samples from pws in large cities could instead verify lab or sample collection procedures rather than conducting independent monitoring sampling rates in our dataset varied substantially between countries for example in kenya only the largest supplier in the dataset sampled as frequently as the gdwq recommendation fig 2 surveillance agencies in kenya did not meet recommendations they sampled pws serving more than 100 000 people a mean of only ten times per year the recommended rate is 240 samples per year for systems serving 100 000 people ugandan surveillance agencies often had a sampling rate greater than recommended in the gdwq for small pws sometimes by a factor of more than six fig 2 notably the surveillance agencies in uganda included a regional agency with a centralized facility responsible for testing water quality for all pws who were subscribed to the service in place of operational monitoring conducted by the suppliers this agency had higher institutionally set targets than the gdwq some monitoring agencies were following national sampling guidelines rather than gdwq recommendations also notably the data collected from pws within a country are not necessarily representative of the country wide situation as their selection through the mfsw program was non random peletz et al 2016 finally the mfsw program was designed to increase sampling rates and succeeded pws included in the mfsw database were sampled at a median of 167 of gdwq recommended rate compared to 67 of the gdwq recommended rate in the retrospective database fig s2 therefore the conclusions drawn from the mfsw database represent a best case scenario of the 59 pws that appeared in both databases 52 91 were located in uganda where the median sampling rate increased from 64 to 175 of the gdqw recommended rate 3 2 determining compliance with an example regulatory limit we simulated the minimum number of samples required to pass the example limit given any possible observed contamination prevalence for up to 2000 samples these simulated values were turned into the curves displayed in fig 3 a using a convex hull algorithm as the observed contamination prevalence of a pws approaches a regulatory limit e g 5 chance of any sample being positive for fib more samples are required to differentiate the true contamination prevalence from the regulatory limit however additional samples have diminishing returns fig 3a for example with 90 confidence pws that observe zero one or two samples positive for fib have true contamination prevalences below the regulated limit if they sample at least 48 105 and 900 times respectively fig 3a pws from our dataset are superimposed as points on fig 3a of the pws in the dataset only 16 n 351 were confidently above ca the example regulatory limit i e with 90 confidence the pws true contamination prevalence was more than the regulatory limit figs 3 and 4 each point represents data from a pws conversely only 14 were confidently below the limit i e with 90 confidence the pws true contamination prevalence was below the regulatory limit for the majority of pws it was statistically uncertain if they were above or below the limit 67 were unconfidently below the limit and 3 were unconfidently above ua the limit figs 3 and 4 a benefit of the doubt instead of a fail safe criterion would shift 70 of pws from failing to passing the regulated limit fig 4 as such providing explicit guidance on the criterion to use when applying a regulatory limit should be a feature at least at the development stage of future recommendations using a face value criterion for compliance with a limit as the gdwq do which does not differentiate between observed and true contamination prevalence has two drawbacks first pws that are unconfidently below ub the limit will periodically fail the regulation without experiencing a change in their system for example a pws sampled 24 times per year with a true contamination prevalence of 4 will fail a yearly limit of 5 an average of one quarter 25 of the time second pws unconfidently above the limit will periodically pass the regulatory limit despite having poor water quality for example a pws sampled 24 times per year with a true contamination prevalence of 8 will pass a yearly limit of 5 an average of more than a third 42 of the time regulators policy makers and monitoring agencies must consider the uncertainty associated with sampling to avoid incorrect decisions the benefit of the doubt criterion can only be justified when almost all pws pass the regulated limit our dataset has a mean observed contamination prevalence of 11 5 table 1 and 19 of pws have an observed contamination prevalence that is above our example limit therefore we conclude that the fail safe method requiring pws to be confident that their true contamination prevalence is 5 is necessary despite its taxing sampling requirements using a fail safe criterion even though 263 of the 351 pws 75 had no samples containing any fib fig 3b 227 of these were not sampled often enough to be below the limit with 90 confidence these 227 pws make up 65 of the total sample this uncertainty may suggest that regulators and monitoring agencies interpret too much from a small number of samples free of fib under sampling was an even larger problem for surveillance agencies 170 of 205 surveillance agencies 83 never detected fib but 164 97 of surveillance agencies who did not detect fib could not confidently conclude that the tested pws met the regulatory limit to make using a fail safe criterion feasible we consider other potential regulatory limits with current sampling practices only half of pws have a true contamination prevalence less than 25 with 90 confidence outside of uganda half of all pws without observations of contamination had been sampled less than four times such sampling programs can only conclude that contamination prevalences are less than 68 with 90 confidence given the expense required for testing for fib regulators must seriously consider if the operational information gained from knowing if a pws contamination prevalence is less than 25 or 68 justifies current expenditures without such considerations current sampling practices create a false sense of knowledge and may not be an effective use of resources like hunter 2002 our data suggest the difference between face value and benefit of the doubt criteria is small in practice only 3 of pws in our dataset that pass a benefit of the doubt criterion fail a face value criterion since a face value criterion is much easier to understand and apply its use would be justified if pws in ssa could be assumed to be in compliance with the regulated limit unfortunately our data do not allow for this conclusion in aggregate ellis 1989 suggests a useful alternative where a fail safe criterion is required regulators may choose a much lower regulatory limit to implement with a face value criterion recognizing that if designed correctly pws that meet the lower limit at face value will also comply with the desired and higher fail safe limit for example any pws passing a face value criterion of none of 36 samples test positive for fib would also pass a fail safe criterion requiring 90 confidence that the true contamination prevalence was 10 these results suggest several opportunities to improve the current testing regime first using higher regulatory limits e g true contamination prevalence 10 would decrease the number of samples required to determine compliance second countries or regions with historic data that consistently passes regulatory limits may be justified in using a benefit of the doubt criterion for evaluating their pws finally pws sampled fewer than five times cannot pass a fail safe limit of 50 contamination therefore the cost effectiveness of dedicating resources to infrequent testing may need to be reconsidered or testing activities should be increased 3 3 detecting quality degradation from a regulatory operational and or managerial perspective it may be useful to know if a pws spatially averaged water quality is improving or degrading accordingly we analyzed sampling rates and observed contamination prevalences from pws in the dataset to understand how long it would take to conclude that a given pws quality had degraded once its observed contamination prevalence changed the detection time depends on the baseline observed contamination prevalence the magnitude of the change in observed contamination prevalence the sampling rate and the required confidence that the true contamination prevalence had increased given the observed sampling rate of a pws the required time before detection could occur follows a 1 x trend for each confidence level fig 5 a detecting changes in performance with less confidence e g 75 instead of 90 leads to faster detection times but more false alarms depending on the costs of false alarms a different level of confidence may be appropriate for different systems in total with 90 confidence we could conclude that quality had degraded for only 229 of 351 65 pws within two years 151 43 within a year and only 36 10 within three months for the majority of pws in the dataset who were sampled fewer than twice per month 57 201 of 351 fig 5b it would take a minimum of 5 months and a median of 13 months to conclude that their contamination had increased even with only 75 confidence fig 5a if the objective of recommendations were to allow a response to changes in the observed contamination prevalence within a fixed amount of time pws with contamination prevalences closer to 50 would need to be sampled more often than those closer to 0 or 100 fig s3 pws with contamination prevalences close to 0 and 100 require the shortest detection times and therefore form the observable 1 x trends fig 5a as the contamination prevalence of a pws approaches 50 the detection time deviates above the 1 x trends the most common sampling rate of pws in the dataset was less than once per month fig 5b which is less than the who gdwq recommends for a pws that serves 5000 after observing an increase in contamination prevalence by 10 percentage points in one of these pws 23 months of data is required to conclude with 90 confidence that contamination had actually increased fig 5a a 23 month delay associated with the gdwq recommendations for a population of 5000 12 samples per year would correspond to a minimum of 115 000 people months of consumed contaminated water for the majority of pws in the dataset regulators and monitoring agencies will require more than a year to conclude with reasonable confidence 90 that a pws performance has degraded after observing an increase in sample contamination by ten percentage points where sampling for fib is being used as a method of detecting changes in water quality improvement or degradation sampling rates need to be increased or attention needs to be focused on sampling other parameters more often e g operational monitoring of disinfectant residuals 3 4 strategies for improving sampling recommendations we identified two immediate opportunities for improving regulatory sampling recommendations 1 the minimum sampling rate and regulatory limit should be harmonized and 2 explicit guidelines should be given for sampling pws when fib is detected during regulatory sampling assuming that regulatory monitoring uses a fail safe criterion as we showed is important for this dataset guidelines for the minimum number of samples should either be increased or the regulated limit should be increased while the current who gdwq recommend a regulated limit of 0 this can give a false sense of security is difficult to analyze and can disincentivize increasing sampling therefore we recommend setting a realistic and measurable regulatory limit potentially starting with a higher limit that can be realistically evaluated based on current sampling practices to facilitate this adjustment fig 6 a illustrates the minimum number of samples required to have 90 and 75 confidence that a pws passes a range of regulatory limits for example if sampling cannot be increased beyond 12 samples and pws are expected to observe no samples positive for fib then the lowest regulated limit should be 17 5 for regulators hoping to be 90 confident that pws have passed the limit fig 6a conversely in scenarios with a specific regulated limit e g 10 chance of any sample being positive for fib with 90 confidence then a minimum number of samples are required for systems that detect no fib 22 samples for the same example fig 6a in general finding even one sample positive for fib increases the uncertainty about the true contamination prevalence of a pws specifying that no samples should be found positive for fib as in the gdwq incentivizes sampling at the minimum required rate ellis 1989 and should not be recommended in future guidelines however if this recommendation is kept for its simplicity additional guidance should be given on what to do when fib is detected a pws in which only a few samples have tested positive for fib may wish to protest that these samples were either an error in processing or were not representative of their pws true contamination prevalence additional sampling can evaluate this claim assuming that regulators use the fail safe criterion for evaluating pws compliance two samples found positive for fib require more than doubling the who gdwq s recommended number of samples in order retrieve the original confidence in the true contamination prevalence fig 6b consider as an example a pws serving 100 000 people which should be sampled 240 times per year if no samples are found positive for fib then the pws true contamination rate is below 1 0 with 90 confidence however if two samples are positive for fib the pws must be sampled an additional 366 samples for a total of 562 samples or 2 3 times the original sampling recommendation before the pws true contamination prevalence could again be considered below 1 0 with 90 confidence more generally fig 6b suggests the required multiplier on the y axis for an arbitrary number of samples found positive for fib on the x axis counter intuitively sampling regimes designed with lower confidence levels require higher sampling multipliers fig 6b this occurs because at lower confidence levels the original certainty without a positive sample is higher for example with 12 samples free of fib the contamination is 17 5 with 90 confidence but 11 with 75 confidence with one sample positive for fib even though the 75 confidence interval is smaller it takes more samples to shift the interval low enough to be 11 than it does to shift the larger 90 interval so that is it once again 17 5 fig 6b many high income countries have adopted adaptive testing guidelines where finding a positive sample results in a requirement for additional sampling epa 2016 commonwealth of australia 2011 the current version of the gdwq does not include a similar recommendation however in previous work we observed that the water suppliers did re test sampling locations after observing contamination to verify and correct the water quality problem kumpel et al 2016 guidelines from some high income countries and the gdwq both provide some guidance on sampling locations such as specifying that at least half of samples must be from the outermost limits of the distribution system as in quebec canada cook et al 2013 who 2011 nevertheless more detailed recommendations about sample stratification would strengthen sampling programs if explicit goals are given for detection limits and confidence levels it is then possible to use these data to optimize sampling rates and how they must adapt under different contamination prevalences 4 conclusion we demonstrated how sampling rates contamination prevalences desired confidence and evaluation criterion can affect interpretation of water quality testing results we found that most pws in ssa in our dataset were sampled too infrequently to ensure they were providing water quality that was safely below an example regulatory limit or to make timely decisions when there was a change while most guidelines rely on sampling rates based on population sizes we demonstrated that contamination prevalences desired confidence in results regulatory limits and the criterion used to evaluate results also dramatically change the usefulness of sampling programs for example there could be adaptive requirements wherein a pws with a moderate number of samples positive for fib would need to be sampled more often to compensate for the increased variance while conversely sampling could be reduced in a pws with a very high prevalence of contamination is observed and the resources instead focused on addressing the cause of contamination higher sampling rates allow for compliance with more stringent regulatory limits guidelines that coordinate sampling rates and regulatory limits would make better use of the results from pws surveillance agencies verifying the quality of large pws as tested by the suppliers do not typically sample often enough to make actionable conclusions about the water quality or to challenge the supplier s sampling results resources could be better spent verifying suppliers labs or sampling procedures regulations that require finding no samples positive for fib provide a false sense of security to those pws that meet them discourage sampling beyond recommended rates and do not provide additional sampling recommendations for agencies to improve the efficacy of monitoring programs sampling recommendations should incorporate the additional factors we highlighted contamination prevalence desired confidence regulatory evaluation criterion and regulatory limit additionally extending the water safety plan framework bartram et al 2009 to differentiate sampling recommendations by the risks identified in a pws can also be useful for example pws with low residual disinfectants should focus on improving disinfection practices instead of additional testing for fib additionally guidelines should clarify separate roles and sampling requirements for suppliers and surveillance agencies to ensure the best use of both types of agencies resources additional research is required to improve the cost effectiveness of sampling first as we have highlighted throughout the manuscript the locations and timings of sampling could be optimized while the gdwq recommend that verification microbial sampling should focus on locations with the best possible chance of detecting contamination water suppliers and surveillance agencies could benefit greatly from clearer suggestions about how to stratify their sampling procedures throughout the stages of water system the timing of supplies and the geographic extent of the network for example if more information were available on the spatial distribution of samples we would be able to distinguish between temporal and spatial trends similarly if contamination mechanisms were modeled in each pws sampling locations could be optimized second better statistical methods to make use of the data provided by quantitative tests for fib could be developed e g our methodology treated all fib tests as pass fail and therefore discarded their quantitative information finally new methods could be created to combine operational monitoring parameters such as disinfectant residual and turbidity

19696,current guidelines for testing drinking water quality recommend that the sampling rate which is the number of samples tested for fecal indicator bacteria fib per year increases as the population served by the drinking water system increases however in low resource settings prevalence of contamination tends to be higher potentially requiring higher sampling rates and different statistical methods not addressed by current sampling recommendations we analyzed 27 930 tests for fib collected from 351 piped water systems in eight countries in sub saharan africa to assess current sampling rates observed contamination prevalences and the ability of monitoring agencies to complete two common objectives of sampling programs determine regulatory compliance and detect a change over time although fib were never detected in samples from 75 of piped water systems only 14 were sampled often enough to conclude with 90 confidence that the true contamination prevalence met an example guideline 5 chance of any sample positive for fib similarly after observing a ten percentage point increase in contaminated samples 43 of pws would still require more than a year before their monitoring agency could be confident that contamination had actually increased we conclude that current sampling practices in these settings may provide insufficient information because they collect too few samples we also conclude that current guidelines could be improved by specifying how to increase sampling after contamination has been detected our results suggest that future recommendations should explicitly consider the regulatory limit and desired confidence in results and adapt when fib is detected keywords sampling programs microbial water quality guidelines for drinking water quality sub saharan africa statistical uncertainty water quality regulations 1 introduction while more than 2 6 billion people have gained access to an improved water source over the last 25 years recent evidence suggests that many of these improved sources do not provide drinking water that is safe onda et al 2012 bain et al 2014a shaheed et al 2014 who and unicef 2015 measurements of water quality are important for managing and controlling water safety and tracking progress to national and global targets such as the sustainable development goals who and unicef 2014 2017 water management agencies around the world sample microbial drinking water quality to assess whether systems provide water that minimizes risks to health rahman et al 2011 peletz et al 2016 water quality can be monitored for regulatory or operational purposes regulatory or verification monitoring is performed to ensure that a water supply meets standards while operational monitoring is used to assess operations and detect changes in performance who 2011 however collecting samples and testing water quality can be expensive time consuming and logistically complicated crocker and bartram 2014 wright et al 2014 bain et al 2014b peletz et al 2016 many countries in sub saharan africa ssa have adopted or adapted the recommendations in the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq for the design of their sampling program peletz et al 2016 in practice many water management agencies in ssa conduct some testing but have not tested enough samples to meet the gdwq recommendations for the number of samples tested peletz et al 2016 therefore optimizing testing is a priority particularly in low resource settings where testing activities are constrained and the prevalence of contamination tends to be higher previous research on improving the efficacy of sampling has focused on piped supplies in high income countries that have generous information about their network e g historical data pipe maps reliably continuous water supply and infrequent contamination speight et al 2004 grayman et al 2007 van lieverloo et al 2007 horowitz 2013 rosen et al 2009 however corresponding analyses on improving the effectiveness of sampling in middle and low income countries which often have limited system data unreliable supplies and frequent contamination have not been performed lee and schwab 2005 to account for the higher prevalence of contamination more frequent sampling and different statistical methods may be necessary current sampling recommendations do not address this possibility sampling plans should achieve the goals of a monitoring program while balancing accuracy of results with ease of application and understanding the gdwq recommend a minimum number of samples for fib be tested annually for regulatory monitoring who 2011 the 2011 gdwq substantially increased sampling in very large systems where budgets and health risks may both be larger and switched from monthly to yearly targets which may decrease operational costs as compared to previous editions of the gdwq who 1993 2008 the gdwq also recommend that none of the tested samples should be found positive for fib who 2011 standards such as these which focus on the allowable number of positive samples are easy to implement and understand but their statistical power cannot be evaluated however in practice standards that allow no positive samples are indistinguishable from high percentile standards e g 1 chance of detecting fib in any sample whose statistical power we can assess ellis 1989 similarly hunter 2002 compared assessing compliance of bathing water with regulations using a threshold approach 95 of samples complying with water quality standards to using a percentile approach the 95th percentile of observed values should not exceed the water quality standard and found that the percentile method complicated the calculation without changing the regulatory decision while sampling programs should consider resource and logistical constraints it is also important to have confidence in the accuracy of the information obtained from a water quality monitoring program as false positives could lead to expending resources unnecessarily and false negatives could result in detrimental health consequences we analyze what can be learned from past monitoring programs that tested piped water quality in ssa by evaluating each system s 1 sampling rate and contamination prevalence 2 ability to assess compliance against a regulatory limit and 3 ability to detect changes in water quality over time our aim is to identify how to increase the effectiveness of sampling recommendations for piped water systems in low resource settings we use these results to inform our recommendations for improving current sampling practices and guidelines 2 methods 2 1 data collection water quality data were collected as part of the monitoring for safe water mfsw program from eight countries in ssa benin ethiopia ghana guinea kenya senegal uganda and zambia peletz et al 2013 2016 kumpel et al 2016 a full description of the mfsw program and participating agencies are described in peletz et al 2016 and kumpel et al 2016 sampling and testing of drinking water was conducted by monitoring agencies responsible for regulatory monitoring of water quality these included water suppliers supplier responsible for providing and monitoring piped water and health or water surveillance agencies surveillance responsible for monitoring and ensuring the quality of all water sources in their jurisdiction some information about sampling locations were available for 71 of samples in the database although these include varying levels of detail fig s1 water quality data were collected during two stages of mfsw 1 retrospective data collected from agencies that had applied to mfsw with samples tested between jan 2009 dec 2013 and 2 mfsw supported data collected by participating monitoring agencies every month with samples tested between jul 2013 apr 2015 the average number of samples taken over time sampling rate by a given agency increased during the mfsw program since the program provided financial support and incentives to agencies to reach sampling rate targets peletz et al 2013 therefore the retrospective data represents baseline conditions while the mfsw supported data represents a best case scenario for sampling rate 2 2 statistical model for water quality in a piped water system the microbial quality of piped water varies spatially and temporally throughout a system ellis 1989 geldreich 1996 spatial variations may be introduced by increasing water age consumption of free chlorine or point sources of contamination e g backflow or intrusion similarly temporal variations may be induced by changes in source water quality treatment efficacy system parameters e g flow rates or pressures momentary low pressure events e g from maintenance or pressure transients or time varying contaminant sources e g increased intrusion after rainfall any water quality sample that tests positive for fib provides the utility with specific and conclusive evidence of a problem that existed at a specific time and a specific location in their system however from a regulatory perspective the important question is not the quality of a specific sample at location x and time y but on average the overall safety of the water distributed by this piped water system ellis 1989 ellis 1989 suggests four possible ways to account for the temporal and spatial variability of water quality first by randomizing samples over space and time second by selecting sampling locations representative of average conditions third by selecting sampling locations representative of the worst conditions and finally by modeling the sources and distribution of contamination and adjusting the sampling strategy accordingly volume 3 of the gdwq for community supplies recommends that sampling locations should be representative of the water source treatment plant storage facilities distribution network points at which water is delivered to the consumer and points of use who 1997 more conservatively the 2011 gdwq recommend that samples should be taken at locations with the best possible chance of detecting contamination who 2011 in either case however repeated samples from fixed locations can bias the results cotter 1985 and dramatically so where a sampling agency takes action to address contamination after it is detected unfortunately it was not possible to verify how sampling agencies selected sampling locations further as sampling locations were not uniformly repeated or randomized credibly accounting for the spatial variations in the samples was beyond the scope of this work the primary drivers of temporal variations are seasonally and weather dependent both of which are geographically dependent given the geographic dispersion in our dataset accounting for climatic and weather phenomena was beyond the scope of this work therefore as a starting point for more refined statistical models in the future and following with analyses conducted in high income contexts ellis 1989 cotter 1985 we combine temporal and spatial sources of variance specifically we model sampling a piped water system at any time or place as a bernoulli trial with a fixed probability of detecting or failing to detect fib functionally this is equivalent to modeling each piped water system as a unique continuously stirred reactor 2 3 definitions 2 3 1 piped water systems pws networked water systems were sampled and tested by various monitoring agencies water suppliers or surveillance agencies the water quality results were then often reviewed and evaluated by water quality technicians operators or management in the monitoring agencies regulators benchmarking institutions and other stakeholders kumpel et al 2016 for this analysis we define a piped water system pws as a networked water system in a village town or city that was tested by one monitoring agency supplier or surveillance whose data were either entirely in the retrospective database or entirely in the mfsw supported database this definition meets two goals 1 to assess how much is known about the performance of individual water systems by each agency that tests them i e we do not pool performance data as sampling agencies would not necessarily have access to the pooled data and 2 to preserve the differences between the two datasets since one represented a baseline condition and the other represented a best case scenario to achieve the first goal we classified the same monitoring agency sampling multiple systems as separate pws e g one monitoring agency sampling two water systems was classified as two separate pws similarly we classified the same water system sampled by different monitoring agencies as separate pws e g the same water system sampled by two monitoring agencies was classified as two separate pws to achieve the second goal if one water system had been sampled by one monitoring agency in both retrospective and mfsw supported datasets we classified it as two separate pws in the analysis finally while we use these data to illustrate the value of data for regulatory and operational scenarios the agencies whose data we analyze were selected non randomly therefore we caution against using the data to interpret the water quality of particular countries peletz et al 2016 2 3 2 contamination prevalence monitoring agencies reported the results of individual water quality samples tested from pws including the date of sample location e g town city or sub district and test results we only included data from sampling points representative of water used for drinking from a piped system i e consumer taps and standpipes we excluded samples from non piped sources and further upstream in a piped distribution system e g raw untreated water water treatment plants and service reservoirs we categorized a result as a test for fecal indicator bacteria fib if the sample was tested for e coli fecal coliform enterococci or h2s or if agencies tested for total coliform and included a confirmation step details in kumpel et al 2016 we define a positive test based on whether a 100 ml sample was positive for fib through a presence absence test or quantitative method e g colony forming units cfu or most probable number mpn we excluded samples from analysis if the method systematically tested a volume less than 100 ml we refer to the percentage of all samples taken from a pws that tested positive for fecal indicator bacteria fib as the observed contamination prevalence specifically due to variance in the number of samples and the spacing of samples the observed contamination prevalence does not consider the time intervals between samples even if nothing about the water quality in a system changes the observed contamination prevalence can fluctuate due to chance e g from one year to the next in keeping with our statistical model we also consider the true contamination prevalence the probability that any sample from a pws would be positive for fib conceptually this can be thought of as the contamination prevalence that would be observed if the pws was randomly sampled a very large number of times the true contamination prevalence of a pws describes the underlying state of the system and does not depend on where or how the system is sampled it only changes when the water quality in the pws changes therefore much of the statistics that follow analyze the difference between the observed and the true contamination prevalences 2 3 3 sampling rates for each pws we calculated the target number of samples tested per year sampling rate for the system as recommended by the who gdwq recommended sampling rate and compared this with the number of samples we observe recorded per year in the dataset observed sampling rate for most pws we had less than one year of data while our observed sampling rates adjusted for this limited observation window our calculations of the statistical uncertainty about a pws contamination prevalence used all available data i e did not adjust for the observation window for pws with more than a year of data this overestimated the certainty available on an annual basis conversely for pws who submitted only a portion of their annual data this underestimated the available certainty about their contamination prevalence in either case by using all available data our method reflects how much regulators could learn about the contamination prevalence in each pws from our dataset recommended for each town or city in the dataset we calculated the recommended minimum annual sampling rate according to the who gdwq 1 12 samples for systems serving 5 000 people 2 12 samples for every 5 000 people for small systems serving 5 000 100 000 people 3 12 samples for every 10 000 people plus 120 samples for systems serving 100 000 500 000 people and 4 12 samples for every 50 000 people plus 600 samples for very large systems 500 000 people who 2011 these sampling rates refer to the number of samples to be tested per year for towns and cities in ethiopia benin and zambia we obtained population data from reports submitted through mfsw peletz et al 2016 for towns and cities in kenya we obtained population data from the water and sanitation regulatory authority wasreb reports wasreb 2012 for towns and cities located in uganda we used the population listed for the town council sub county or district capital from the 2014 housing census data or for those municipalities spread over several administrative units we summed the populations of the relevant administrative units ugandan bureau of statistics 2014 for very small community parish systems in uganda we used the mean parish size for that district or when missing a neighboring district from the 2002 housing census uganda bureau of statistics 2006 since most parishes had populations of 5000 people which results in a constant recommendation of 12 samples per year the gdwq recommended sampling rates did not depend on exact parish populations we were unable to obtain relevant population data for the towns and cities in the dataset from ghana guinea or senegal and therefore pws from these three countries are not included in the analysis presented in section 3 1 which compares the recommended sampling rate to the observed sampling rate often countries have national standards which require a higher sampling rate than the who gdwq peletz et al 2016 however here we consider only the gdwq sampling rate for uniformity observed we calculated the observed annual sampling rate based on the obtained water quality data due to differences in incentives and program structure we accounted for missing data differently in the retrospective and mfsw supported data using retrospective data from samples tested from 2011 to 2013 we calculated the mean monthly sampling rate between the first and the last month of all months for which test results were recorded for each pws since fewer than 12 months of retrospective data were available for many pws this method inflated the sampling rate of pws in the retrospective database that were sampled for only a few consecutive months using mfsw supported data we calculated the mean monthly sampling rate from the first year of mfsw data during the first year all participating pws were supposed to have submitted data we multiplied all mean monthly sampling rates by 12 to obtain annual sampling rates and categorized sampling rates by data source retrospective or mfsw supported 2 4 statistical methods first we aggregated contamination prevalences and observed sampling rates for each pws to understand the range of sampling patterns and observations we then evaluated whether the water quality results from a single pws could be used to 1 determine compliance of a pws with an example regulatory limit regulatory monitoring and 2 detect performance degradation operational monitoring to improve existing recommendations we demonstrated how regulatory limits and sampling rates could be harmonized and quantified how much additional sampling should be required when a given number of samples test positive for fib determining compliance with an example regulatory limit the 2011 who gdwq recommend no samples should be positive for fib we analyze only the stated recommendations and explore the statistical power and limitations of sampling programs that would follow the gdwq under the current gdwq it is easy to determine whether or not a pws has passed the standard however how confident should a monitoring agency be that the pws in question has a true contamination prevalence of for example 5 to facilitate this type of uncertainty analysis we follow ellis 1989 and convert the gdwq into a percentile standard the exact percentile equivalent depends on the number of samples and desired confidence level as a starting point we consider a limit of 5 similar to the limit in the us 1989 total coliform rule for systems testing more than 40 samples in a month specifically we consider two alternative regulatory limits in every pws there should be a 5 chance of detecting fib in any sample with either 75 or 90 confidence these alternative regulatory limits allow us to quantify the uncertainty caused by existing sampling practices and recommended sampling rates since we classified samples tested for fib as positive or negative contained fib or did not contain fib in a 100 ml sample the results were binomially distributed using the observed contamination prevalence for each pws we evaluated the range in which the true contamination prevalence was expected to lie below 90 of the time and the range in which the true contamination prevalence was expected lie above 90 of the time displayed as error bars implemented using the clopper pearson algorithm in r r core team 2016 version 3 2 1 we then used these confidence intervals to classify all pws in the dataset into four categories a confidently with 90 confidence above ca the regulated limit 5 b unconfidently above the limit ua c unconfidently below the limit ub and d confidently below the limit cb fig 1 three evaluation criteria can be used to convert the four classifications into a regulatory verdict of passing or failing benefit of the doubt face value or fail safe ellis 1989 mcbride 2005 the most relaxed is the benefit of the doubt criterion where the true contamination prevalence is assumed to pass the regulated limit unless proved otherwise with the required level of confidence e g passes unless we have 90 confidence the true contamination prevalence is 5 i e only ca fails the most common and current gdwq approach is the face value criterion where the observed contamination prevalence is assumed to be the true contamination prevalence and confidence levels are ignored i e ca and ua fail the standard finally the most conservative is the fail safe criterion where pws are assumed to fail the regulated limit unless proved otherwise with the required level of confidence e g fails unless we have 90 confidence the true contamination prevalence is 5 i e only cb passes the relationship between pws categorization and evaluation criterion is detailed in fig 1 detecting quality degradation while the who gdwq are designed for regulatory monitoring results are also likely to be used by water system operators to make operational decisions and regulators to detect temporal trends we therefore explore how much should be learned from existing sampling practices about changes in water quality as the sampling requirements for operational monitoring are higher we adopt a benefit of the doubt approach determining how long it would take before an operator or regulator could be sure that their pws true contamination prevalence had increased i e water quality has degraded we do not however quantify the probability of failing to detect a genuine change i e type ii error see for e g mcbride 2005 our statistical model treats temporal and spatial variations equivalently therefore this section considers how many samples are required to distinguish between sample sets with observed contamination prevalences that differ for a sampling agency with fixed sampling locations the spatial variation is controlled for and different contamination prevalences could be interpreted as a degradation in water quality over time for an agency with randomized sampling locations the difference in observed contamination prevalences could be induced by temporal or spatial variations nevertheless if each set of samples was taken at randomized locations and at randomized times the difference could still be interpreted as temporally induced with the statistical confidence suggested by the method that follows cotter 1985 we calculated the minimum number of samples required before a large 10 percentage point increase in the observed contamination prevalence of a pws would lead to the conclusion that the pws had actually experienced a degradation in water quality with a given level of statistical confidence to achieve this we modeled each pws as having two sets of samples of equal size each with an unknown true contamination prevalence the first set was taken to have an observed contamination prevalence equal to the one in the dataset the second set was simulated to have an observed contamination prevalence 10 percentage points higher e g from 1 of samples contaminated to 11 or from 85 to 95 the prior assumption about the true contamination prevalence in each set of samples was independent and uniformly distributed from 0 to 100 we used bayesian updating to model how more samples increased the confidence that the observed change was also a true change the specific equations used to calculate the minimum number of required samples using beta distributions and solved numerically are in text s1 the calculated minimum number of samples was converted into a minimum time by dividing the minimum number of samples by the observed sampling rate for each pws strategies for improving sampling recommendations to illustrate how to align sampling recommendations and regulatory limits we calculated the minimum number of samples required to pass a fail safe regulatory limit the most conservative definition fig 1 with a given confidence again using the clopper pearson algorithm depending on the time horizon of study monthly quarterly yearly etc the minimum number of required samples can be converted into a minimum sampling rate by dividing the required number of samples by the time horizon in which data would be assessed e g if 24 samples are required and we want to assess the water quality in every quarter this translates into 96 24 0 25 samples per year the gdwq recommend that no samples be found positive for fib however should a pws be penalized if it is sampled 2 5 times more often than the recommended minimum rate and one sample is found to be positive for fib similarly in a pws in which only a few samples test positive for fib these few samples may not be representative of their pws true contamination prevalence we therefore calculated how many more samples would need to be tested after a contaminated sample was detected to return to the original level of confidence in a pws true contamination prevalence to do so we first quantified the existing confidence in the true contamination prevalence associated with a pws sampled according to the who gdwq and with no samples found positive for fib we then calculated the number of additional samples that must be tested to retrieve the original level of certainty after a given number of samples are found to be positive for fib this calculation was done by increasing the number of samples taken until the upper limit of the new confidence interval was equal or less than the limit without any observed contamination for computational efficiency with large sampling numbers we tested the nearest integer to e 0 01 x x z 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling rates and observed contamination the dataset for analysis included 351 pws representing 270 different distinct areas towns or cities in eight countries of these pws 58 were sampled by surveillance agencies and the remainder by water suppliers table 1 however suppliers took more samples 83 of samples in the dataset were tested by suppliers compared to 17 by surveillance agencies n 27 930 each pws was tested for fib a mean of 80 times range 1 7765 over a mean of 9 6 months range 1 26 table 1 the mean percent of samples positive for fib observed contamination prevalence per pws was 11 5 range 0 100 table 1 the breakdown of pws sizes by country is included as table s1 annual sampling rates per pws ranged from no samples per year to 7168 samples per year with a mean of 76 and a median of 12 table s2 within the subset of samples with location information 71 n 27 930 47 n 349 of pws were repeatedly sampled a mean of two or more times per sampling location or neighborhood fig s1 three country specific observations must be noted first senegal had the highest percent of samples positive for fib in our database at 45 table 1 however data from senegal were gathered entirely by a surveillance agency which was more likely to test in low resourced and rural water supplies which are more likely to be contaminated peletz et al 2016 kumpel et al 2016 second fib were not detected in any samples from any pws in our database from ghana although total coliform not reported as an fib were occasionally detected likely because only three towns were monitored fewer samples were taken relative to other countries and half of samples had detectable free chlorine residual third pws from uganda are heavily represented comprising 56 of the pws in the dataset we performed all analyses both with and without data from uganda where important the results of this sensitivity study are noted we compared the observed sampling rates per pws to the recommended sampling rates calculated from the gdwq fig 2 more pws serving smaller populations met the gdwq recommendations than pws serving larger populations the median sampling rate for pws serving fewer than 10 000 people was 108 of the gdwq recommendation and dropped to 45 for pws serving more than 10 000 people fig 2 while supplier sampling rates generally increased with the size of the population served surveillance sampling rates showed no increasing trend with population served four of the five 80 surveillance agencies monitoring pws that served more than 100 000 people had observed sampling rates lower than 5 of the gdwq recommended rate while surveillance agencies are often responsible for testing every water source in their jurisdiction e g piped systems wells springs in practice they often prioritize testing rural sources over urban piped sources peletz et al 2016 kumpel et al 2016 guidance on sampling rates for surveillance agencies is especially important when they are responsible for verifying the results of a supplier s testing for example the time and resources invested in surveillance agencies testing only a few samples from pws in large cities could instead verify lab or sample collection procedures rather than conducting independent monitoring sampling rates in our dataset varied substantially between countries for example in kenya only the largest supplier in the dataset sampled as frequently as the gdwq recommendation fig 2 surveillance agencies in kenya did not meet recommendations they sampled pws serving more than 100 000 people a mean of only ten times per year the recommended rate is 240 samples per year for systems serving 100 000 people ugandan surveillance agencies often had a sampling rate greater than recommended in the gdwq for small pws sometimes by a factor of more than six fig 2 notably the surveillance agencies in uganda included a regional agency with a centralized facility responsible for testing water quality for all pws who were subscribed to the service in place of operational monitoring conducted by the suppliers this agency had higher institutionally set targets than the gdwq some monitoring agencies were following national sampling guidelines rather than gdwq recommendations also notably the data collected from pws within a country are not necessarily representative of the country wide situation as their selection through the mfsw program was non random peletz et al 2016 finally the mfsw program was designed to increase sampling rates and succeeded pws included in the mfsw database were sampled at a median of 167 of gdwq recommended rate compared to 67 of the gdwq recommended rate in the retrospective database fig s2 therefore the conclusions drawn from the mfsw database represent a best case scenario of the 59 pws that appeared in both databases 52 91 were located in uganda where the median sampling rate increased from 64 to 175 of the gdqw recommended rate 3 2 determining compliance with an example regulatory limit we simulated the minimum number of samples required to pass the example limit given any possible observed contamination prevalence for up to 2000 samples these simulated values were turned into the curves displayed in fig 3 a using a convex hull algorithm as the observed contamination prevalence of a pws approaches a regulatory limit e g 5 chance of any sample being positive for fib more samples are required to differentiate the true contamination prevalence from the regulatory limit however additional samples have diminishing returns fig 3a for example with 90 confidence pws that observe zero one or two samples positive for fib have true contamination prevalences below the regulated limit if they sample at least 48 105 and 900 times respectively fig 3a pws from our dataset are superimposed as points on fig 3a of the pws in the dataset only 16 n 351 were confidently above ca the example regulatory limit i e with 90 confidence the pws true contamination prevalence was more than the regulatory limit figs 3 and 4 each point represents data from a pws conversely only 14 were confidently below the limit i e with 90 confidence the pws true contamination prevalence was below the regulatory limit for the majority of pws it was statistically uncertain if they were above or below the limit 67 were unconfidently below the limit and 3 were unconfidently above ua the limit figs 3 and 4 a benefit of the doubt instead of a fail safe criterion would shift 70 of pws from failing to passing the regulated limit fig 4 as such providing explicit guidance on the criterion to use when applying a regulatory limit should be a feature at least at the development stage of future recommendations using a face value criterion for compliance with a limit as the gdwq do which does not differentiate between observed and true contamination prevalence has two drawbacks first pws that are unconfidently below ub the limit will periodically fail the regulation without experiencing a change in their system for example a pws sampled 24 times per year with a true contamination prevalence of 4 will fail a yearly limit of 5 an average of one quarter 25 of the time second pws unconfidently above the limit will periodically pass the regulatory limit despite having poor water quality for example a pws sampled 24 times per year with a true contamination prevalence of 8 will pass a yearly limit of 5 an average of more than a third 42 of the time regulators policy makers and monitoring agencies must consider the uncertainty associated with sampling to avoid incorrect decisions the benefit of the doubt criterion can only be justified when almost all pws pass the regulated limit our dataset has a mean observed contamination prevalence of 11 5 table 1 and 19 of pws have an observed contamination prevalence that is above our example limit therefore we conclude that the fail safe method requiring pws to be confident that their true contamination prevalence is 5 is necessary despite its taxing sampling requirements using a fail safe criterion even though 263 of the 351 pws 75 had no samples containing any fib fig 3b 227 of these were not sampled often enough to be below the limit with 90 confidence these 227 pws make up 65 of the total sample this uncertainty may suggest that regulators and monitoring agencies interpret too much from a small number of samples free of fib under sampling was an even larger problem for surveillance agencies 170 of 205 surveillance agencies 83 never detected fib but 164 97 of surveillance agencies who did not detect fib could not confidently conclude that the tested pws met the regulatory limit to make using a fail safe criterion feasible we consider other potential regulatory limits with current sampling practices only half of pws have a true contamination prevalence less than 25 with 90 confidence outside of uganda half of all pws without observations of contamination had been sampled less than four times such sampling programs can only conclude that contamination prevalences are less than 68 with 90 confidence given the expense required for testing for fib regulators must seriously consider if the operational information gained from knowing if a pws contamination prevalence is less than 25 or 68 justifies current expenditures without such considerations current sampling practices create a false sense of knowledge and may not be an effective use of resources like hunter 2002 our data suggest the difference between face value and benefit of the doubt criteria is small in practice only 3 of pws in our dataset that pass a benefit of the doubt criterion fail a face value criterion since a face value criterion is much easier to understand and apply its use would be justified if pws in ssa could be assumed to be in compliance with the regulated limit unfortunately our data do not allow for this conclusion in aggregate ellis 1989 suggests a useful alternative where a fail safe criterion is required regulators may choose a much lower regulatory limit to implement with a face value criterion recognizing that if designed correctly pws that meet the lower limit at face value will also comply with the desired and higher fail safe limit for example any pws passing a face value criterion of none of 36 samples test positive for fib would also pass a fail safe criterion requiring 90 confidence that the true contamination prevalence was 10 these results suggest several opportunities to improve the current testing regime first using higher regulatory limits e g true contamination prevalence 10 would decrease the number of samples required to determine compliance second countries or regions with historic data that consistently passes regulatory limits may be justified in using a benefit of the doubt criterion for evaluating their pws finally pws sampled fewer than five times cannot pass a fail safe limit of 50 contamination therefore the cost effectiveness of dedicating resources to infrequent testing may need to be reconsidered or testing activities should be increased 3 3 detecting quality degradation from a regulatory operational and or managerial perspective it may be useful to know if a pws spatially averaged water quality is improving or degrading accordingly we analyzed sampling rates and observed contamination prevalences from pws in the dataset to understand how long it would take to conclude that a given pws quality had degraded once its observed contamination prevalence changed the detection time depends on the baseline observed contamination prevalence the magnitude of the change in observed contamination prevalence the sampling rate and the required confidence that the true contamination prevalence had increased given the observed sampling rate of a pws the required time before detection could occur follows a 1 x trend for each confidence level fig 5 a detecting changes in performance with less confidence e g 75 instead of 90 leads to faster detection times but more false alarms depending on the costs of false alarms a different level of confidence may be appropriate for different systems in total with 90 confidence we could conclude that quality had degraded for only 229 of 351 65 pws within two years 151 43 within a year and only 36 10 within three months for the majority of pws in the dataset who were sampled fewer than twice per month 57 201 of 351 fig 5b it would take a minimum of 5 months and a median of 13 months to conclude that their contamination had increased even with only 75 confidence fig 5a if the objective of recommendations were to allow a response to changes in the observed contamination prevalence within a fixed amount of time pws with contamination prevalences closer to 50 would need to be sampled more often than those closer to 0 or 100 fig s3 pws with contamination prevalences close to 0 and 100 require the shortest detection times and therefore form the observable 1 x trends fig 5a as the contamination prevalence of a pws approaches 50 the detection time deviates above the 1 x trends the most common sampling rate of pws in the dataset was less than once per month fig 5b which is less than the who gdwq recommends for a pws that serves 5000 after observing an increase in contamination prevalence by 10 percentage points in one of these pws 23 months of data is required to conclude with 90 confidence that contamination had actually increased fig 5a a 23 month delay associated with the gdwq recommendations for a population of 5000 12 samples per year would correspond to a minimum of 115 000 people months of consumed contaminated water for the majority of pws in the dataset regulators and monitoring agencies will require more than a year to conclude with reasonable confidence 90 that a pws performance has degraded after observing an increase in sample contamination by ten percentage points where sampling for fib is being used as a method of detecting changes in water quality improvement or degradation sampling rates need to be increased or attention needs to be focused on sampling other parameters more often e g operational monitoring of disinfectant residuals 3 4 strategies for improving sampling recommendations we identified two immediate opportunities for improving regulatory sampling recommendations 1 the minimum sampling rate and regulatory limit should be harmonized and 2 explicit guidelines should be given for sampling pws when fib is detected during regulatory sampling assuming that regulatory monitoring uses a fail safe criterion as we showed is important for this dataset guidelines for the minimum number of samples should either be increased or the regulated limit should be increased while the current who gdwq recommend a regulated limit of 0 this can give a false sense of security is difficult to analyze and can disincentivize increasing sampling therefore we recommend setting a realistic and measurable regulatory limit potentially starting with a higher limit that can be realistically evaluated based on current sampling practices to facilitate this adjustment fig 6 a illustrates the minimum number of samples required to have 90 and 75 confidence that a pws passes a range of regulatory limits for example if sampling cannot be increased beyond 12 samples and pws are expected to observe no samples positive for fib then the lowest regulated limit should be 17 5 for regulators hoping to be 90 confident that pws have passed the limit fig 6a conversely in scenarios with a specific regulated limit e g 10 chance of any sample being positive for fib with 90 confidence then a minimum number of samples are required for systems that detect no fib 22 samples for the same example fig 6a in general finding even one sample positive for fib increases the uncertainty about the true contamination prevalence of a pws specifying that no samples should be found positive for fib as in the gdwq incentivizes sampling at the minimum required rate ellis 1989 and should not be recommended in future guidelines however if this recommendation is kept for its simplicity additional guidance should be given on what to do when fib is detected a pws in which only a few samples have tested positive for fib may wish to protest that these samples were either an error in processing or were not representative of their pws true contamination prevalence additional sampling can evaluate this claim assuming that regulators use the fail safe criterion for evaluating pws compliance two samples found positive for fib require more than doubling the who gdwq s recommended number of samples in order retrieve the original confidence in the true contamination prevalence fig 6b consider as an example a pws serving 100 000 people which should be sampled 240 times per year if no samples are found positive for fib then the pws true contamination rate is below 1 0 with 90 confidence however if two samples are positive for fib the pws must be sampled an additional 366 samples for a total of 562 samples or 2 3 times the original sampling recommendation before the pws true contamination prevalence could again be considered below 1 0 with 90 confidence more generally fig 6b suggests the required multiplier on the y axis for an arbitrary number of samples found positive for fib on the x axis counter intuitively sampling regimes designed with lower confidence levels require higher sampling multipliers fig 6b this occurs because at lower confidence levels the original certainty without a positive sample is higher for example with 12 samples free of fib the contamination is 17 5 with 90 confidence but 11 with 75 confidence with one sample positive for fib even though the 75 confidence interval is smaller it takes more samples to shift the interval low enough to be 11 than it does to shift the larger 90 interval so that is it once again 17 5 fig 6b many high income countries have adopted adaptive testing guidelines where finding a positive sample results in a requirement for additional sampling epa 2016 commonwealth of australia 2011 the current version of the gdwq does not include a similar recommendation however in previous work we observed that the water suppliers did re test sampling locations after observing contamination to verify and correct the water quality problem kumpel et al 2016 guidelines from some high income countries and the gdwq both provide some guidance on sampling locations such as specifying that at least half of samples must be from the outermost limits of the distribution system as in quebec canada cook et al 2013 who 2011 nevertheless more detailed recommendations about sample stratification would strengthen sampling programs if explicit goals are given for detection limits and confidence levels it is then possible to use these data to optimize sampling rates and how they must adapt under different contamination prevalences 4 conclusion we demonstrated how sampling rates contamination prevalences desired confidence and evaluation criterion can affect interpretation of water quality testing results we found that most pws in ssa in our dataset were sampled too infrequently to ensure they were providing water quality that was safely below an example regulatory limit or to make timely decisions when there was a change while most guidelines rely on sampling rates based on population sizes we demonstrated that contamination prevalences desired confidence in results regulatory limits and the criterion used to evaluate results also dramatically change the usefulness of sampling programs for example there could be adaptive requirements wherein a pws with a moderate number of samples positive for fib would need to be sampled more often to compensate for the increased variance while conversely sampling could be reduced in a pws with a very high prevalence of contamination is observed and the resources instead focused on addressing the cause of contamination higher sampling rates allow for compliance with more stringent regulatory limits guidelines that coordinate sampling rates and regulatory limits would make better use of the results from pws surveillance agencies verifying the quality of large pws as tested by the suppliers do not typically sample often enough to make actionable conclusions about the water quality or to challenge the supplier s sampling results resources could be better spent verifying suppliers labs or sampling procedures regulations that require finding no samples positive for fib provide a false sense of security to those pws that meet them discourage sampling beyond recommended rates and do not provide additional sampling recommendations for agencies to improve the efficacy of monitoring programs sampling recommendations should incorporate the additional factors we highlighted contamination prevalence desired confidence regulatory evaluation criterion and regulatory limit additionally extending the water safety plan framework bartram et al 2009 to differentiate sampling recommendations by the risks identified in a pws can also be useful for example pws with low residual disinfectants should focus on improving disinfection practices instead of additional testing for fib additionally guidelines should clarify separate roles and sampling requirements for suppliers and surveillance agencies to ensure the best use of both types of agencies resources additional research is required to improve the cost effectiveness of sampling first as we have highlighted throughout the manuscript the locations and timings of sampling could be optimized while the gdwq recommend that verification microbial sampling should focus on locations with the best possible chance of detecting contamination water suppliers and surveillance agencies could benefit greatly from clearer suggestions about how to stratify their sampling procedures throughout the stages of water system the timing of supplies and the geographic extent of the network for example if more information were available on the spatial distribution of samples we would be able to distinguish between temporal and spatial trends similarly if contamination mechanisms were modeled in each pws sampling locations could be optimized second better statistical methods to make use of the data provided by quantitative tests for fib could be developed e g our methodology treated all fib tests as pass fail and therefore discarded their quantitative information finally new methods could be created to combine operational monitoring parameters such as disinfectant residual and turbidity measurements with microbial test results as these operational parameters are often less expensive and less time consuming to measure acknowledgments this work was supported by a grant from the bill

19697,high throughput sequencing based metagenomic analysis and network analysis were applied to investigate the broad spectrum profiles of args in landfill leachate from 12 cities in china in total 526 arg subtypes belonging to 21 arg types were detected with abundances ranging from 1 1 10 6 to 2 09 10 1 copy of arg copy of 16s rrna gene 68 arg subtypes that accounted for 73 4 93 4 of the total arg abundances were shared by all leachate samples the four most abundant args sul1 sul2 aada and baca can be served as arg indicators to quantitatively predict the total abundances by linear functions r2 0 577 0 819 p 0 001 no distinct regional distribution pattern of the args was observed among different cities in china while the arg compositions of the leachate were clearly distinct from those of other environmental sample types nearly 90 arg subtypes in the anaerobic digestion sludge from sewage treatment plants stpads were shared by the leachate and the abundances of leachate and stpads args generalists accounted for 84 5 and 87 7 of total abundances in these two types of anaerobic samples respectively furthermore procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition might be the determining factor of arg compositions in landfill leachate args within the same type or among the different types showed higher incidences of non random co occurrence and 17 genera might be potential hosts of multiple args this study highlighted that landfill leachate is an important reservoir of various args and provided a useful reference for the surveillance and risk

arg profiles in the leachate by pcr and quantitative pcr qpcr approaches yang et al 2013 high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomics analysis is a powerful tool to overcome the limitations of above methods schmieder and edwards 2012 it has been used to reveal the broad spectrum profile of args in various environmental samples christgen et al 2015 garner et al 2016 jia et al 2017 lau et al 2017 consequently the hts based metagenomic analysis was used in this study to comprehensively understand the occurrence and abundance of args in landfill leachate in addition the leachate quality is different in landfills located in varied climatic regions naveen et al 2017 which may have an influence on the composition of microbial community and args however the differences similarities in composition of args in landfill leachate from different regions have not been extensively investigated thus 13 landfills from 12 chinese cities located in north china east china central south china and south china were selected to evaluate the broad spectrum resistome profiles in the leachate it is well known that landfill leachate and anaerobic digestion sludge from sewage treatment plants stpads are formed under anaerobic conditions in two typical anaerobic engineering systems respectively metagenomic analysis has revealed that a variety of args existed in stpads which is also viewed as arg hotspot christgen et al 2015 guo et al 2017 luo et al 2017 however no study has been reported to systematically evaluate the similarity and difference of resistome between the two typical anaerobic environments therefore 16 public metagenomic datasets of stpads were downloaded and reanalyzed using the same pipeline to conduct the detailed comparison in the present study the objectives of this study were 1 to comprehensively characterize the arg profiles in the landfill leachate from different cities in china using the hts based metagenomic analysis 2 to compare arg profiles in two

using the primers f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and r806 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 bates et al 2011 pcr reactions were performed according to bates et al 2011 the pcr amplicons were purified using the ultraclean pcr clean up kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa and then quantified using nanodrop spectrophotometer nd one thermo fisher scientific usa a single composite sample was produced that contained barcoded pcr product normalized in equimolar amounts to produce equivalent sequencing depth from all samples kozich et al 2013 the sample was sent for sequencing at novogene tianjin china on an illumina miseq platform 250 bp paired end strategy 2 5 bioinformatic analysis 2 5 1 args analysis the online args analysis pipeline developed recently i e args oap was used to determine the resistome profiles of the landfill leachate metagenome datasets yang et al 2016 the first step was pre screening of potential args sequences from short reads in metagenomic datasets using ublast on a local computer followed by a second step in which args were annotated and classified using blastx with the default parameters after uploading identified potential args sequences yang et al 2016 arg types subtypes were identified and their abundances were calculated with normalization by the 16s rrna gene sequence length the number of 16s rrna genes and the arg reference sequence length arg abundance was expressed as copy of arg per copy of 16s rrna gene thereafter called ratio the core database of args oap i e sarg comprises 24 arg types and 1209 subtypes for instance tetracycline resistance genes is an arg type whereas teta is one subtype of the tetracycline resistance genes 2 5 2 microbial community analysis all the raw sequencing data of the 16s rrna amplicons were processed in mothur v 1 35 1 schloss et al 2009 briefly sequences were first demultiplexed quality trimmed aligned and finally checked with chimeraslayer to remove chimeric sequences following the standard practice in the mothur manual then the normalization of the clear sequences was conducted by randomly extracting 15606 clean sequences from each sample data set to fairly compare all samples at the same sequencing depth ju et al 2014 next the normalized sequences from all samples were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the uparse pipeline at identity threshold of 97 which approximately corresponding to the taxonomic levels of species for bacteria edgar 2013 the taxonomic classification of each representative sequence from each otu was conducted using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier version 2 11 wang et al 2007 a confidence threshold of 80 recommended by the rdp was applied to assign the sequences to different taxonomy levels diversity indices otus chao1 estimator shannon index and simpson index and rarefaction curves were obtained at a 97 similarity level 2 6 statistical analysis and network analysis all statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 student s t test was performed using spss17 0 ibm usa to examine the statistically significant difference between mean values of two independent groups pearson correlation analysis was also conducted using spss17 0 to identify the correlations between the arg abundance and different variables non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and procrustes analysis were implemented using rstudio with the r vegan package based on the nmds results of arg subtype profiles and otus procrustes analysis was performed using the protest function with 999 permutations to verify significance munck et al 2015 the m2 value is the sum of the squared distances between matched sample pairs the p value was obtained by recalculating the m2 value and comparing the original m2 value with the simulated distribution a significant correlation between the antibiotic resistome profile and the microbial community profile was confirmed if p 0 05 forsberg et al 2014 to investigate co occurrence patterns among args and microbial community a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations among the arg subtypes and genera network analysis was performed in r environment using vegan igraph and hmisc packages and the visualization was conducted on the interactive platform of gephi 0 9 1 following our previous study li et al 2015 the details of network analysis were summarized in text s1 supplementary information in the network the observed o and random incidences r of co occurrence correlation between two entities i e arg and or genus were statistically checked and calculated o was calculated as the number of observed edges divided by total number of edges in the network while r was theoretically calculated by considering the frequencies of two entities and random association the degree of a lack of agreement between o and r o r ratio table s6 is used as a benchmark for checking nonrandom co occurrence patterns ju et al 2016 3 results 3 1 occurrence and abundance of arg types as shown in fig s3a the arg abundance in leachate samples varied considerably ranging from 8 68 10 2 to 7 52 10 1 ratio the leachate from changsha cs and shanghai sh 3 had the lowest and highest arg abundances respectively in total 21 arg types were detected in the 19 leachate samples fig 1 a among the 21 arg types aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam chloramphenicol fosmidomycin macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls multidrug polymyxin rifamycin sulfonamide tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes were shared by all the leachate samples fig 1a the compositions of arg types in 19 leachate samples varied greatly fig s3b and the resistance genes for sulfonamide 5 15 10 3 3 35 10 1 ratio mls 3 13 10 2 1 86 10 1 ratio aminoglycoside 7 12 10 3 9 54 10 2 ratio multidrug 3 05 10 3 1 77 10 1 ratio and tetracycline 8 44 10 3 8 86 10 2 ratio were the five most dominant types in the 19 leachate samples fig 1b and fig s3b accounting for 71 1 93 0 of the total arg abundances pearson correlation analysis indicated that the total arg abundance positively correlated with the abundance of sulfonamide aminoglycoside bacitracin multidrug and tetracycline quinolone and rifamycin resistance genes r2 0 504 0 785 p 0 001 table s7 although args in ltp were mostly induced by landfill leachate the composition of args in leachate as from ltp ltpas and ads from ltp ltpads samples varied greatly 17 and 16 args types were detected in the ltpas and ltpads samples respectively fig 1a the compositions of arg types in the three ltpas samples from shenzhen were similar and the most dominant arg types were multidrug sulfonamide mls bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes accounting for average 88 4 of the total arg abundances fig s3b notably the composition of arg types in the ltpas sample from fenyi fy was similar to the leachate sample from the same city and the abundant arg types were sulfonamide multidrug aminoglycoside bacitracin and tetracycline resistance genes for the sole ltpads sample the resistome composition mainly comprised mls tetracycline aminoglycoside multidrug and sulfonamide resistance genes fig s3b 3 2 occurrence and abundance of arg subtypes a total of 540 arg subtypes were identified in all samples ranging from 137 to 305 subtypes per sample fig s3c 526 arg subtypes were detected in 19 leachate samples with an abundance range of 1 10 10 6 2 09 10 1 ratio among the 540 subtypes the top 30 most abundant args of each sample were extracted and totally 114 subtypes were shown in fig s4 the abundance of these top 30 arg subtypes accounted for 86 6 98 2 of the total arg abundance in each sample a set of 68 arg subtypes belonging to 12 arg types were shared by all leachate samples fig 2 and the abundance of these core args contributed 73 4 93 4 to the total arg abundances among the core args resistance genes of sul1 sul2 ermf aada and baca were the five most abundant subtypes with an average abundance of more than 1 0 10 1 ratio for each subtype the abundances of sul1 r2 0 734 p 10 5 sul2 r2 0 577 p 0 001 aada r2 0 685 p 10 4 baca r2 0 776 p 10 6 and the sum abundance of the four genes r2 0 819 p 10 6 were positively correlated to the total arg abundances fig s5 for ltpas samples 226 arg subtypes were detected within the abundance range of 5 11 10 6 3 41 10 1 ratio there were 91 shared arg subtypes and the abundance accounted for 96 6 97 6 of the total arg abundance the resistance genes sul1 3 41 10 1 ratio sul2 2 20 10 1 ratio and aada 1 21 10 1 ratio were the most abundant subtypes in fy as accounting for 60 5 of the total abundance in addition 147 arg subtypes were detected in the stpads fig s3c and ermf tetm ermg mefa and erm tr were the five most abundant subtypes 3 3 similarity analysis of arg profiles in landfill leachate and other samples the similarity of arg compositions in 19 leachate four ltpas one ltpads and 16 stpads samples was evaluated using nmds based on the abundance of arg subtypes fig 3 the arg profiles of leachate and stpads were clearly separated with each other no distinct regional distribution pattern of the args was observed among the leachate samples from different cities however the leachate samples from the same city usually clustered closely such as sz 1 sz 2 and sz 4 cz 1 and cz 2 sh 1 and sh 2 it should be pointed out that the similarity of arg profiles in the leachate samples may be related to leachate collection and storage systems climate types sample source landfill capacity and disposal rate notably there was clear grouping difference between the sole ltpads and the other 16 stpads this ltpads sample clustered more closely with the leachate samples rather than the 16 stpads samples in addition the ltpas samples from shenzhen and fenyi separated clearly nmds was also used to determine the differences of arg compositions between landfill leachate and other nine environmental types fig s6 samples from the same environmental types generally clustered more closely with each other obvious distinction of the args was observed between the leachate and other environmental samples 3 4 comparison of arg profiles between landfill leachate and stpads as shown in fig 4 a the abundance of args in landfill leachate average 3 13 10 1 ratio was significantly higher than that in stpads average 1 42 10 1 ratio student s t test p 0 01 the differences between the abundance of each arg type in the two types of samples were also investigated by student s t test fig 4b among the 21 arg types the abundance of mls tetracycline sulfonamide aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and trimethoprim resistance genes in the leachate were significantly higher than those in stpads p 0 05 fig 4b however higher abundance of rifamycin resistance genes was observed in stpads p 0 01 fig 4b in total 526 and 323 arg subtypes were detected in 19 landfill leachate and 16 stpads samples respectively the shared and unique arg subtypes between landfill leachate and stpads were shown in fig 5 a out of the 566 args subtypes detected in all samples a total of 283 subtypes belonging to 19 types were shared by leachate and stpads these shared args accounted for 53 8 and 87 6 of the total detected arg subtype numbers for leachate and stpads respectively the args represented by an average abundance of more than 1 0 10 4 ratio was drawn in the occupancy abundance plot fig 5b to split args into three arbitrarily defined categories i landfill leachate and stpads args generalists 79 args that were widely distributed in both at least 60 leachate 12 samples and 60 stpads 10 samples ii landfill leachate args generalists 26 args that appeared in at least 60 leachate samples but no more than 20 stpads three samples and iii stpads args generalists one arg that appeared in at least 60 stpads but no more than 20 leachate three samples fig 5b among the 79 landfill leachate and stpads args generalists sul1 sul2 ermf baca and aada were the five most abundant subtypes the abundance of these 79 arg generalists accounted for 72 2 94 0 mean 84 5 and 81 9 93 8 mean 87 7 of the total abundance of args in leachate and stpads respectively among the 26 landfill leachate args generalists aph 3 i was the most abundant one for stpads the sole arg generalists was tet43 3 5 characterization of microbial communities in total 327372 high quality sequences 15606 19906 per sample of 16s rrna gene were obtained table s8 these sequences were clustered into 4825 otus 432 1230 for each sample mean 813 at 97 similarity cutoff rarefaction curves showed a quite different pattern of microbial community diversity across all samples fig s7 which was confirmed when evaluated by the diversity index of chao 1 shannon and simpson table s8 calculated coverage ranging from 97 5 to 99 5 table s8 revealed that most communities were covered employing the current high throughput sequencing depth lin et al 2014 3 5 1 microbial community compositions at phylum level as shown in fig s8 more than 30 bacterial and archaeal phyla were detected in all the samples bacterial community was dominated by bacteroidetes proteobacteria firmicutes cloacimonetes and thermotogae while archaeal community was dominated by euryarchaeota notably bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes were the three most dominant bacterial phyla in the landfill leachate of yy fy sh 1 sh 2 tj hht and bt accounting for 39 1 95 6 of the total abundances for zh cz 1 and bj the bacterial community was dominated by proteobacteria and firmicutes and the total abundance of the two phyla in three samples was 88 3 63 0 and 50 9 respectively for the ltpas bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were the two most abundant phyla accounting for 33 6 56 8 of the total abundance while the communities of the ltpads were mainly comprised bacteroidetes 14 7 firmicutes 14 7 verrucomicrobia 13 3 and cloacimonetes 12 0 fig s8 for the archaeal community euryarchaeota was the most abundant phylum in all samples with the exception of the leachate from fy in which no euryarchaeota was identified at the current sequencing depth the abundance of euryarchaeota accounted for 0 48 25 7 0 07 2 62 and 26 1 in leachate ltpas and ltpads samples respectively 3 5 2 microbial community compositions at genus level among the 307 assigned genera in landfill leachate samples six genera including acholeplasma aminivibrio candidatus cloacamonas petrimonas sedimentibacter and tissierella were shared by all the 19 samples there were 102 rare genera that only appeared in one or two samples accounting for a different abundance ranges 0 006 30 0 of the microbial communities in leachate as shown in fig s9 the most abundant 10 genera were mainly classified into the phylum of proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and euryarchaeota generally the core microbiota among all the samples varied greatly for instance candidatus cloacamonas and syntrophomonas were the two most dominant genera in the leachate of sz 1 and sz 2 while defluviitoga was most abundant in the leachate of sz 4 cz 2 hht and xh notably seven archaeal genera methanobrevibacter methanocorpusculum methanoculleus methanofollis methanogenium methanosarcina methanothrix affiliated with euryarchaeota were abundant in most of the leachate and the sole ltpads samples 3 5 3 the similarities of the microbial community structures nmds was also conducted to evaluate the similarities of the microbial community structures among all the landfill leachate samples based on the otu abundance fig s10 similar to the arg compositions the ltpas samples were well separated from the leachate samples and the sole ltpads clustered closely with the leachate samples collected from the same city generally the samples from the same city were clustered closely such as sz cz sh and sz as however no obvious regional cluster of microbial community was observed for samples collected from north china east china central south china and south china 3 6 correlations of args with environmental factors water quality parameters and antibiotic concentrations of the leachate were summarized in table s9 and table s10 respectively pearson correlation analysis showed the concentrations of tn nh3 n tp cod toc and ec negatively correlated to the landfill ages p 0 05 table s11 likewise negative correlations between the concentrations of these water quality parameters and the arg abundance were found p 0 05 table s11 however landfill age was positively correlated with the total abundance of args p 0 01 table s11 in total 20 antibiotics belonging to seven classes sulfonamides fluoroquinolones tetracyclines beta lactams macrolide lincosamides trimethoprim and chloramphenicol were detected and the total concentrations ng l 1 of the seven major antibiotic classes in the leachate samples were 273 1 11017 3 273 2 15136 2 16 5 2407 1 19 8 413 9 838 7 13639 9 0 149 5 and 0 343 6 respectively table s10 the concentrations of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were negatively correlated with the total arg abundance p 0 01 while other antibiotic classes had no significant correlations with the arg abundance table s12 3 7 correlation of args with microbial community compositions procrustes analysis was used to investigate whether the args correlated with the microbial composition based on the nmds of both the arg profile and microbial community profile obtained via the otu based 16s rrna gene analysis approach as shown in fig 6 the analysis revealed a significant correlation m2 0 367 p 0 001 999 permutations between args profiles and microbial community profiles in different samples procrustes analysis could provide new insight for the overall correlations between args and the microbial community composition in landfill leachate however it cannot illustrate the detailed relations between the specific arg subtypes and microbial taxa the co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa deciphered by network analysis could provide an effective complement to the overall correlation information co occurrence patterns between args and microbial community were explored using network inference based on strong ρ 0 8 and significant p 0 01 correlations fig 7 the co occurrence patterns consisted of 127 nodes 32 microbial taxa and 95 args subtypes and 498 edges some topological properties widely used in network analysis were calculated to describe the complex pattern of interrelationships among args subtypes and microbial taxa text s2 the detailed co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa were summarized in table s13 based on the previous study li et al 2015 it was hypothesized that the nonrandom co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa could indicate the potential host information of args if the args and the co existed microbial taxa possessed the significantly similar abundance trends among the different samples ρ 0 8 p 0 01 as shown in fig 7 and table s13 16 bacterial genera and one archaea genus were speculated as the potential hosts of 47 agrs based on the co occurrence results among the 17 genera hydrogenophaga and thauera took along more diverse args 22 and 13 respectively than other genera for instance hydrogenophaga was found to have nonrandom connections with aminoglycoside resistance gene aada chloramphenicol resistance genes chloramphenicol exporter cmla and flor multidrug resistance genes acrb mdtf mexd mexw multidrug transporter smee ceob smeb amrb mexc mexi sdey and bpef sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 and tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc and tetg thauera was the possible host of resistance genes of mexw ceob amrb mexi and bpef all of which belongs to the multidrug resistance genes other bacterial taxa had connections with only one or two resistance genes for example adek was correlated with acinetobacter while tet37 and cfxa2 were correlated with bacteroides 3 8 co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes structural and statistical analyses demonstrate that nonrandom co occurrence patterns were evident within or across arg types fig 7 and table s6 for the arg subtypes from the same arg type multidrug 35 subtypes tetracycline 15 subtypes mls 12 subtypes aminoglycoside 9 subtypes chloramphenicol 7 subtypes beta lactam 6 subtypes and fosmidomycin 2 subtypes tended to co occur much more 44 5 than expected under random association 10 5 table s6 despite of their different degrees of intra type co occurrence as reflected by o r ratio especially multidrug mls and aminoglycoside resistance genes showed high possibility of non random co occurrence o 39 0 1 41 and 1 01 respectively than that of random positive association r 7 44 0 82 and 0 45 respectively and the inconsistencies were most pronounced in arg type of multidrug o r 5 25 moreover higher nonrandom co occurrence incidences were also observed for the arg subtypes among different arg types table s6 for example higher incidences of co occurrence than expected by chance were observed between arg subtypes of multidrug and chloramphenicol o 4 83 r 3 06 bacitracin o 3 82 r 0 44 sulfonamide o 3 02 r 1 31 quinolone o 1 81 r 0 44 as well as fosmidomycin o 3 42 r 0 87 similar co occurrence patterns were also observed between sulfonamide resistance genes and the args encoding aminoglycoside o 1 41 r 0 34 and chloramphenicol o 1 01 r 0 26 4 discussion 4 1 overview of args in landfill leachate using hts based metagenomics approach we firstly provided a comprehensive insight of the args occurring in landfill leachate from different cities in china a total of 526 arg subtypes belonging to 21 arg types were identified and the genes conferring resistance to sulfonamide mls aminoglycoside multidrug and tetracycline were the most abundant in the 19 leachate samples from 12 cities highlighting that landfill leachate is an important reservoir of args valuable insights have also been gained by pcr based approaches to investigate a few groups of args in landfill leachate table s14 wang et al 2015b wu et al 2015 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 su et al 2017a yi et al 2017 however these studies only covered a limited number of well studied arg types mainly including the resistance genes of sulfonamide tetracycline beta lactam and mls for arg subtypes 28 subtypes in total were covered in the args detection list in these previous studies table s14 accordingly the pcr based approaches provided a mere snapshot of the arg profiles in landfill leachate combining metagenomic analysis with sarg database 526 arg subtypes were detected in our study 1 2 orders of magnitude more arg subtypes than those detected in the leachate reported previously moreover the abundances of the 28 args reported previously accounted for 22 1 49 0 of total arg abundances in our study most of the args in our study have not been reported before indicating there are new findings using the novel approach therefore this could avoid the underestimation of arg profiles and provide more comprehensive data for assessing the ecological risks of args releasing from landfill leachate in previous studies the abundances of the detected args varied distinctly depending on the arg types and different landfills table s14 sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were generally more abundant than other args for instance wang et al 2015b reported that the abundance ranges of sul1 and sul2 in 12 leachate samples were 4 5 10 5 3 1 10 2 and 1 4 10 4 6 2 10 2 ratio respectively yi et al 2017 also detected a considerably higher abundance of sul1 and sul2 in the leachate from singapore with a range of 1 3 10 2 1 8 10 1 and 1 5 10 3 1 3 10 1 ratio respectively these findings were remarkably consistent with our results i e the abundance ranges of sul1 and sul2 in 19 leachate samples were 8 4 10 4 2 1 10 1 and 3 1 10 3 1 9 10 1 ratio respectively we found that the arg abundances in landfill leachate were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in sediments river as from stp stpas and stpads fig s11 moreover metagenomics analysis revealed the arg profiles in the leachate were different from those in other environments for example jia et al 2017 indicated tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes dominated in the swine wastewater and the downstream water while guo et al 2017 found the dominant arg types in the stpas were genes conferring resistance to beta lactams fluoroquinolones glycopeptides and sulfonamides the differences in the abundance and composition between leachate and other environmental samples may be associated with the complex formation process and unusual physico chemical properties of the leachate which could result in significantly different microbial community structures kjeldsen et al 2002 köchling et al 2015 wu et al 2017 in addition pal et al 2016 demonstrated that the variable abundances and types of resistance genes are partially governed by the selection pressure within each environment type in the present study sul1 sul2 aada and baca were the most abundant args in the leachate and the abundances of these genes were positively correlated to the total arg abundances r2 0 577 p 0 001 therefore the high abundances of these four args in the leachate can be served as potential arg indicators to predict total arg abundances in the leachate to indicate the total abundance of args in landfill leachate samples a simple and quick qpcr assay of sul1 sul2 aada and baca as the target genes could be used this will substantially save on the detection time and labor intensity for monitoring these args in leachate samples similarly the abundance of baca and aada as well as the sum of the abundances of the six most abundant args baca sul1 macb ermf mefa and aada in stpads was significantly positively correlated with the total arg abundances r2 0 519 p 0 001 fig s12 li et al 2015 once proposed that tetm and aminoglycoside resistance protein could act as the arg indicators to predict the quantity of the correspondingly co occurring args in various environments therefore this approach can be further investigated and validated using more datasets in subsequent studies in this study the arg profiles of ltpas of shenzhen and fenyi were also investigated the abundances and compositions of args in the ltpas of shenzhen significantly varied with that in the ltpas of fenyi the very high abundances of args especially sul1 and sul2 in the ltpas of fenyi may be linked with the operational parameters of the ltp however the higher arg abundance in the ltpas than those in corresponding leachate suggested that the treatment process of leachate might result in the enrichment of args fig s2 which may be related to the change of microbial community structure the arg profiles in as from ltp and stp was compared and there were obvious differences in the abundances and compositions of args between the two types of as fig s6 and fig s11 the different influent sources of ltp and stp might be the major reason which could cause the divergences of microbial community structure in the two as processes and then impact the resistome indirectly 4 2 influencing factors of args in landfill leachate generally the abundant and diverse arg types were associated with the antibiotics used extensively as human or veterinary medicine looft et al 2012 forslund et al 2014 args could have entered landfill directly or developed over time in the presence of antibiotic residues in msw then these may cause the presence of args in landfill leachate eggen et al 2010 yi et al 2017 in this study although antibiotics in the leachate had relatively high concentrations no significant correlations were found between most target antibiotics and their corresponding args suggesting direct selection of antibiotics might not be a key pressure shaping the resistome consistently previous studies confirmed that the types and levels of args and antibiotics did not depend on each other owing to different environmental fate and transport mechanisms of antibiotics and args in the leachate wu et al 2015 yi et al 2017 the fate of antibiotics tends to rely on hydrolysis sorption desorption and chemical biological degradation processes while the fate of args is likely to rely on bacterial host type wu et al 2015 yi et al 2017 contrary to our result su et al 2017a observed the abundance of sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were in accord with the antibiotic levels in the leachate yu et al 2016 reported that most studied antibiotics were positively correlated to the args and high levels of antibiotics forced severe selection pressure in the closed landfill environment therefore the relationship between args and the antibiotic concentrations is very complex and the enrichment of args may not be only contributed by the antibiotic selective pressure hu et al 2013 on the whole there was a negative correlation p 0 05 between the landfill age and almost all the measured water quality parameters including tn nh3 n tp toc cod and ec indeed landfill age has a significant effect on the leachate composition especially on organics and ammonia concentrations kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 however it has been confirmed that the leachate quality from the same landfill with the same landfill ages also varied indicating that the landfill is highly heterogeneous wang et al 2015b during the lifespan of a landfill the hydrology operation conditions of landfill e g drainage rate and disposal rate the amount composition and properties of msw may change continuously kjeldsen et al 2002 slack et al 2005 all these factors can affect leachate quantity leachate quality the microbial community and args in the leachate pearson correlation analysis also revealed negative correlation between water quality parameters and args p 0 05 in contrast landfill age was positively correlated with the total abundance of args p 0 01 similarly yu et al 2016 found that the carbon related parameters cod bod5 and doc held a decreasing tendency with the landfill age and were significantly negatively correlated to the args yi et al 2017 noted that old landfill site served as important reservoir of args however wang et al 2015b reported that the abundance of sul1 was negatively correlated to the landfill ages suggesting that the args decreased along time addition regardless of whether present in living or dead cells args which could move between microbes via horizontal gene transfer can survive in the landfills for years without the presence of their live hosts even after the selective pressure responsible for their formation has been removed song et al 2016 yu et al 2016 therefore landfill age can exert a powerful influence on the abundance of args in the leachate overall the differences of arg behavior and fate in the leachate among different landfills could be attributed to various factors such as refuse type landfill age landfilling patterns climate conditions and physico chemical properties of each landfill site threedeach et al 2012 wang et al 2015b su et al 2017a yi et al 2017 nevertheless the effects of some landfilling conditions i e the amount types and properties of msw temperatures inside landfills cover and drainage systems etc on the arg profiles of the leachate need to be further investigated because the information is not available in the present study although the environmental factors play certain roles in the presence of args it is noteworthy that microbes are the hosts of args it is well known that environmental conditions closely link to the variations of microbial community structure which is considered to be an important factor promoting the enhancement and spread of args novo et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in our study procrustes analysis suggested that arg profiles were significantly correlated with microbial community this indicated that microbial community compositions may be the determining factor of arg compositions in landfill leachate similar results by procrustes analysis were also reported regarding to the resistome of soil groundwater and stp forsberg et al 2014 found that resistome composition correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure both across and within soil types chen et al 2017 suggested that arg profiles were significantly p 0 001 correlated with bacterial community in the groundwater near msw landfill and further demonstrated that bacterial community shifts contributed 65 8 of the total arg variations using variation partitioning analysis in addition two recent studies also indicated that the stp core resistome is linked to the microbial community significantly p 0 001 munck et al 2015 su et al 2017b 4 3 co occurrence patterns among args and microbial taxa the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes revealed the incidences of nonrandom co occurrence of args within the same types e g multidrug mls and aminoglycoside or among different types e g multidrug and sulfonamide in landfill leachate our observations of nonrandom arg co occurrence patterns are well supported by recent evidences of significant positive correlations between arg subtypes of the same type or different types determined by qpcr sun et al 2014 johnson et al 2016 and metagenomic approaches ju et al 2016 jia et al 2017 higher incidences of co occurrence than random association between arg subtypes may generally reflect selective pressure exerted by the antibiotics in shaping antibiotic resistome sun et al 2014 ju et al 2016 in addition the intertypes co occurrence of args are more likely driven by the same resistance mechanism ju et al 2016 which is supported by our results that the genes of chloramphenicol exporter cmla mexw mdtf and amrb encoding antibiotic efflux proteins co occurred significantly and positively besides many novel pairwise examples revealed in our arg arg network fig 7 previous studies have also reported the co occurrence mechanisms of various arg subtypes such as i the resistance genes of tetracycline teta and aminoglycoside aph 3 vib aph 3 ib and aph 6 id encoded within the same genome isolated from a stp adamczuk and dziewit 2017 ii sul1 cat and aac 6 ib involved in the same multidrug resistance region of pkp368 10 plasmid bueno et al 2016 iii aada5 and dfra17 carried by a complete class 1 integron detected on an assembled scaffold of chicken feces ma et al 2016 iv gene cassette arrays conferring co resistance to aminoglycosides aada and aaca4 and beta lactams bla oxa 10 tacão et al 2014 and v sul2 dfra1 and cmla1 co occurred within the class 1 integrase and is6100 type transposons cluster in chinese swine farms johnson et al 2016 etc based on the previous study li et al 2015 it was hypothesized that the nonrandom co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa could indicate the possible host information of args if the args and the co existed microbial taxa possessed the significantly similar abundance trends among the different samples in other words one of the reasonable explanations of the corresponding similar abundance trends was because of some specific microbial taxa carrying some specific args which has been verified by forsberg s study 2014 in the present study network analysis revealed that 16 bacterial genera and one archaea genus were speculated as the hosts of 47 agrs in the leachate some arg hosts have been verified in previous studies for example acinetobacter the potential host of adek has been verified by several studies lopes and amyes 2013 sugawara and nikaido 2014 recently network analysis has been widely used to explore the potential hosts of args in different environments such as groundwater chen et al 2017 estuarine sediments zhu et al 2017 and stp guo et al 2017 therefore network analysis is a reasonable tool to provide us new insights into the args and their possible hosts in complex environmental samples li et al 2015 nevertheless the correlation between args and microbial community revealed by this approach need to be further validated using culture based method munir et al 2011 metagenomics assembly ma et al 2016 or function metagenomics approaches mullany 2014 4 4 comparison of arg profiles between landfill leachate and stpads to explore the characteristics of args in the typical anaerobic environments we compared the arg profiles between landfill leachate and stpads both of which are generated under anaerobic conditions nearly 90 args in the stpads were shared by the leachate and the abundant types in these two anaerobic engineering environments were similar this tendency was confirmed by occupancy abundance plot analysis indicating the abundances of args belonging to the leachate and stpads args generalists accounted for very high proportions about 85 of total abundances in these two types of anaerobic samples the anaerobic formation conditions of the leachate and stpads made them have similar microbial community structures which are the hosts of these shared or general args although microbial richness and evenness may be different the compositions of dominant phyla in the leachate were similar to those in the stpads in previous studies rivière et al 2009 yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 ju et al 2016 guo et al 2017 therefore microbial community may be the dominant factors in the distribution of args in the two anaerobic environments nevertheless it is essential to further explore the relations between args and microbial communities under anaerobic conditions and provide more information on the control of args in landfill leachate and stpads 5 conclusions the arg profiles in landfill leachate from 12 different cities in china were comprehensively characterized and compared with other types of environmental samples using hts based metagenomic approach landfill leachate harbored abundant and diverse args and acted as an important reservoir of args the total arg abundances in landfill leachate were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in sediments river stpas and stpads the resistance genes for sulfonamide mls aminoglycoside multidrug and tetracycline were the five most dominant arg types in the leachate no distinct regional distribution pattern of the args was found among the leachate samples from different cities while the arg compositions of the leachate were clearly different from those of other environments a prevalent core set of args including 79 subtypes was widely distributed in the two typical anaerobic environments leachate and stpads landfill age and water quality parameters played important roles in shaping args profiles in landfill leachate moreover the compositions of args were significantly correlated with microbial community and their strong and significant non random co occurrence patterns with args presents an appropriate approach to track the potential arg hosts in landfill leachate acknowledgements the authors thank the national

19697,high throughput sequencing based metagenomic analysis and network analysis were applied to investigate the broad spectrum profiles of args in landfill leachate from 12 cities in china in total 526 arg subtypes belonging to 21 arg types were detected with abundances ranging from 1 1 10 6 to 2 09 10 1 copy of arg copy of 16s rrna gene 68 arg subtypes that accounted for 73 4 93 4 of the total arg abundances were shared by all leachate samples the four most abundant args sul1 sul2 aada and baca can be served as arg indicators to quantitatively predict the total abundances by linear functions r2 0 577 0 819 p 0 001 no distinct regional distribution pattern of the args was observed among different cities in china while the arg compositions of the leachate were clearly distinct from those of other environmental sample types nearly 90 arg subtypes in the anaerobic digestion sludge from sewage treatment plants stpads were shared by the leachate and the abundances of leachate and stpads args generalists accounted for 84 5 and 87 7 of total abundances in these two types of anaerobic samples respectively furthermore procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition might be the determining factor of arg compositions in landfill leachate args within the same type or among the different types showed higher incidences of non random co occurrence and 17 genera might be potential hosts of multiple args this study highlighted that landfill leachate is an important reservoir of various args and provided a useful reference for the surveillance and risk management of args in landfill environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes landfill leachate anaerobic digestion sludge metagenomic analysis network analysis 1 introduction as emerging contaminants the effect of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb is currently considered to be a serious environmental problem which poses a serious threat to human and animal health on a global scale who 2014 berendonk et al 2015 so far not only the medical settings but also environmental compartments such as soil municipal wastewater pharmaceutical manufacturing effluents aquaculture and animal husbandry facilities have been found to be hotspots of args zhu et al 2013 bengtsson palme et al 2014 wang et al 2015a cabello et al 2016 guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 currently landfilling is the most common and essential management strategy for the disposal of municipal solid waste msw worldwide especially in the developing countries foo and hameed 2009 eggen et al 2010 in the large and medium sized cities of china there were 657 landfills operating in 2016 which received about 60 of the total volume of msw disposed national bureau of statistics of china 2017 landfill is considered as a potential repository of antibiotics for receiving unwanted and unused drugs illegal clinical wastes pet feces sludge used baby diapers and toilet papers from clinics hospitals and households eggen et al 2010 threedeach et al 2012 landfill leachate formed by the percolation of liquid through landfills is a combination of contaminants including organic matter ammonia nitrogen heavy metals chlorinated organics inorganic salts as well as args renou et al 2008 clarke et al 2015 wang et al 2015b yi et al 2017 args in the leachate can transfer to the recipient environments and result in serious risk on ecosystem safety and human health zhang et al 2016 several polymerase chain reaction pcr based studies mainly focused on the occurrence and abundance of a few arg subtypes in the leachate wang et al 2015b wu et al 2015 yu et al 2016 however owing to limited availability of primers little is known regarding the comprehensive arg profiles in the leachate by pcr and quantitative pcr qpcr approaches yang et al 2013 high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomics analysis is a powerful tool to overcome the limitations of above methods schmieder and edwards 2012 it has been used to reveal the broad spectrum profile of args in various environmental samples christgen et al 2015 garner et al 2016 jia et al 2017 lau et al 2017 consequently the hts based metagenomic analysis was used in this study to comprehensively understand the occurrence and abundance of args in landfill leachate in addition the leachate quality is different in landfills located in varied climatic regions naveen et al 2017 which may have an influence on the composition of microbial community and args however the differences similarities in composition of args in landfill leachate from different regions have not been extensively investigated thus 13 landfills from 12 chinese cities located in north china east china central south china and south china were selected to evaluate the broad spectrum resistome profiles in the leachate it is well known that landfill leachate and anaerobic digestion sludge from sewage treatment plants stpads are formed under anaerobic conditions in two typical anaerobic engineering systems respectively metagenomic analysis has revealed that a variety of args existed in stpads which is also viewed as arg hotspot christgen et al 2015 guo et al 2017 luo et al 2017 however no study has been reported to systematically evaluate the similarity and difference of resistome between the two typical anaerobic environments therefore 16 public metagenomic datasets of stpads were downloaded and reanalyzed using the same pipeline to conduct the detailed comparison in the present study the objectives of this study were 1 to comprehensively characterize the arg profiles in the landfill leachate from different cities in china using the hts based metagenomic analysis 2 to compare arg profiles in two typical anaerobic engineering systems i e landfill and municipal anaerobic digester and 3 to identify the relationships of environmental factors and microbial community with args and the co occurrence patterns among args and microbial taxa in landfill leachate using network analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and public metagenomics datasets collection a total of 19 leachate

zhang 2015 the fixed samples were placed into dry ice box and transferred to laboratory within 48 h on arriving the laboratory each leachate sample was filtrated by sterilized 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes 47 mm diameter millipore usa and the microbial dna in the membranes were then extracted the fixed as and ads samples were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 10 min to collect pellet as soon as arriving the laboratory following by the dna extraction simultaneously another 1 l sample of each leachate without adding ethanol was also collected to conduct chemical analyses these samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min and then the aqueous phase was filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters 47 mm diameter millipore usa for further solid phase extraction spe and other water quality parameter detection in the present study 16 stpads metagenomics datasets were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read achieve and mg rast rapid

insert size of 350 bp sequencing was performed on illumina hiseq 4000 platform 150 bp paired end strategy the metagenomic data size for each sample was about 10 gb resulting in a total of over 240 gb data output from 24 samples all the metagenomic data sets were deposited in mg rast server under the project id mgp21084 http metagenomics anl gov mgmain html mgpage project project mgp21084 and the related information for each sample were summarized in table s5 2 4 2 16s rrna gene sequencing to characterize microbial communities the hypervariable v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and r806 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 bates et al 2011 pcr reactions were performed according to bates et al 2011 the pcr amplicons were purified using the ultraclean pcr clean up kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa and then quantified using nanodrop spectrophotometer nd one thermo fisher scientific usa a single composite sample was produced that contained barcoded pcr product normalized in equimolar amounts to produce equivalent sequencing depth from all samples kozich et al 2013 the sample was sent for sequencing at novogene tianjin china on an illumina miseq platform 250 bp paired end strategy 2 5 bioinformatic analysis 2 5 1 args analysis the online args analysis pipeline developed recently i e args oap was used to determine the resistome profiles of the landfill leachate metagenome datasets yang et al 2016 the first step was pre screening of potential args sequences from short reads in metagenomic datasets using ublast on a local computer followed by a second step in which args were annotated and classified using blastx with the default parameters after uploading identified potential args sequences yang et al 2016 arg types subtypes were identified and their abundances were calculated with normalization by the 16s rrna gene sequence length the number of 16s rrna genes and the arg reference sequence length arg abundance was expressed as copy of arg per copy of 16s rrna gene thereafter called ratio the core database of args oap i e sarg comprises 24 arg types and 1209 subtypes for instance tetracycline resistance genes is an arg type whereas teta is one subtype of the tetracycline resistance genes 2 5 2 microbial community analysis all the raw sequencing data of the 16s rrna amplicons were processed in mothur v 1 35 1 schloss et al 2009 briefly sequences were first demultiplexed quality trimmed aligned and finally checked with chimeraslayer to remove chimeric sequences following the standard practice in the mothur manual then the normalization of the clear sequences was conducted by randomly extracting 15606 clean sequences from each sample data set to fairly compare all samples at the same sequencing depth ju et al 2014 next the normalized sequences from all samples were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the uparse pipeline at identity threshold of 97 which approximately corresponding to the taxonomic levels of species for bacteria edgar 2013 the taxonomic classification of each representative sequence from each otu was conducted using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier version 2 11 wang et al 2007 a confidence threshold of 80 recommended by the rdp was applied to assign the sequences to different taxonomy levels diversity indices otus chao1 estimator shannon index and simpson index and rarefaction curves were obtained at a 97 similarity level 2 6 statistical analysis and network analysis all statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 student s t test was performed using spss17 0 ibm usa to examine the statistically significant difference between mean values of two independent groups pearson correlation analysis was also conducted using spss17 0 to identify the correlations between the arg abundance and different variables non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and procrustes analysis were implemented using rstudio with the r vegan package based on the nmds results of arg subtype profiles and otus procrustes analysis was performed using the protest function with 999 permutations to verify significance munck et al 2015 the m2 value is the sum of the squared distances between matched sample pairs the p value was obtained by recalculating the m2 value and comparing the original m2 value with the simulated distribution a significant correlation between the antibiotic resistome profile and the microbial community profile was confirmed if p 0 05 forsberg et al 2014 to investigate co occurrence patterns among args and microbial community a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations among the arg subtypes and genera network analysis was performed in r environment using vegan igraph and hmisc packages and the visualization was conducted on the interactive platform of gephi 0 9 1 following our previous study li et al 2015 the details of network analysis were summarized in text s1 supplementary information in the network the observed o and random incidences r of co occurrence correlation between two entities i e arg and or genus were statistically checked and calculated o was calculated as the number of observed edges divided by total number of edges in the network while r was theoretically calculated by considering the frequencies of two entities and random association the degree of a lack of agreement between o and r o r ratio table s6 is used as a benchmark for checking nonrandom co occurrence patterns ju et al 2016 3 results 3 1 occurrence and abundance of arg types as shown in fig s3a the arg abundance in leachate samples varied considerably ranging from 8 68 10 2 to 7 52 10 1 ratio the leachate from changsha cs and shanghai sh 3 had the lowest and highest arg abundances respectively in total 21 arg types were detected in the 19 leachate samples fig 1 a among the 21 arg types aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam chloramphenicol fosmidomycin macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls multidrug polymyxin rifamycin sulfonamide tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes were shared by all the leachate samples fig 1a the compositions of arg types in 19 leachate samples varied greatly fig s3b and the resistance genes for sulfonamide 5 15 10 3 3 35 10 1 ratio mls 3 13 10 2 1 86 10 1 ratio aminoglycoside 7 12 10 3 9 54 10 2 ratio multidrug 3 05 10 3 1 77 10 1 ratio and tetracycline 8 44 10 3 8 86 10 2 ratio were the five most dominant types in the 19 leachate samples fig 1b and fig s3b accounting for 71 1 93 0 of the total arg abundances pearson correlation analysis indicated that the total arg abundance positively correlated with the abundance of sulfonamide aminoglycoside bacitracin multidrug and tetracycline quinolone and rifamycin resistance genes r2 0 504 0 785 p 0 001 table s7 although args in ltp were mostly induced by landfill leachate the composition of args in leachate as from ltp ltpas and ads from ltp ltpads samples varied greatly 17 and 16 args types were detected in the ltpas and ltpads samples respectively fig 1a the compositions of arg types in the three ltpas samples from shenzhen were similar and the most dominant arg types were multidrug sulfonamide mls bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes accounting for average 88 4 of the total arg abundances fig s3b notably the composition of arg types in the ltpas sample from fenyi fy was similar to the leachate sample from the same city and the abundant arg types were sulfonamide multidrug aminoglycoside bacitracin and tetracycline resistance genes for the sole ltpads sample the resistome composition mainly comprised mls tetracycline aminoglycoside multidrug and sulfonamide resistance genes fig s3b 3 2 occurrence and abundance of arg subtypes a total of 540 arg subtypes were identified in all samples ranging from 137 to 305 subtypes per sample fig s3c 526 arg subtypes were detected in 19 leachate samples with an abundance range of 1 10 10 6 2 09 10 1 ratio among the 540 subtypes the top 30 most abundant args of each sample were extracted and totally 114 subtypes were shown in fig s4 the abundance of these top 30 arg subtypes accounted for 86 6 98 2 of the total arg abundance in each sample a set of 68 arg subtypes belonging to 12 arg types were shared by all leachate samples fig 2 and the abundance of these core args contributed 73 4 93 4 to the total arg abundances among the core args resistance genes of sul1 sul2 ermf aada and baca were the five most abundant subtypes with an average abundance of more than 1 0 10 1 ratio for each subtype the abundances of sul1 r2 0 734 p 10 5 sul2 r2 0 577 p 0 001 aada r2 0 685 p 10 4 baca r2 0 776 p 10 6 and the sum abundance of the four genes r2 0 819 p 10 6 were positively correlated to the total arg abundances fig s5 for ltpas samples 226 arg subtypes were detected within the abundance range of 5 11 10 6 3 41 10 1 ratio there were 91 shared arg subtypes and the abundance accounted for 96 6 97 6 of the total arg abundance the resistance genes sul1 3 41 10 1 ratio sul2 2 20 10 1 ratio and aada 1 21 10 1 ratio were the most abundant subtypes in fy as accounting for 60 5 of the total abundance in addition 147 arg subtypes were detected in the stpads fig s3c and ermf tetm ermg mefa and erm tr were the five most abundant subtypes 3 3 similarity analysis of arg profiles in landfill leachate and other samples the similarity of arg compositions in 19 leachate four ltpas one ltpads and 16 stpads samples was evaluated using nmds based on the abundance of arg subtypes fig 3 the arg profiles of leachate and stpads were clearly separated with each other no distinct regional distribution pattern of the args was observed among the leachate samples from different cities however the leachate samples from the same city usually clustered closely such as sz 1 sz 2 and sz 4 cz 1 and cz 2 sh 1 and sh 2 it should be pointed out that the similarity of arg profiles in the leachate samples may be related to leachate collection and storage systems climate types sample source landfill capacity and disposal rate notably there was clear grouping difference between the sole ltpads and the other 16 stpads this ltpads sample clustered more closely with the leachate samples rather than the 16 stpads samples in addition the ltpas samples from shenzhen and fenyi separated clearly nmds was also used to determine the differences of arg compositions between landfill leachate and other nine environmental types fig s6 samples from the same environmental types generally clustered more closely with each other obvious distinction of the args was observed between the leachate and other environmental samples 3 4 comparison of arg profiles between landfill leachate and stpads as shown in fig 4 a the abundance of args in landfill leachate average 3 13 10 1 ratio was significantly higher than that in stpads average 1 42 10 1 ratio student s t test p 0 01 the differences between the abundance of each arg type in the two types of samples were also investigated by student s t test fig 4b among the 21 arg types the abundance of mls tetracycline sulfonamide aminoglycoside chloramphenicol and trimethoprim resistance genes in the leachate were significantly higher than those in stpads p 0 05 fig 4b however higher abundance of rifamycin resistance genes was observed in stpads p 0 01 fig 4b in total 526 and 323 arg subtypes were detected in 19 landfill leachate and 16 stpads samples respectively the shared and unique arg subtypes between landfill leachate and stpads were shown in fig 5 a out of the 566 args subtypes detected in all samples a total of 283 subtypes belonging to 19 types were shared by leachate and stpads these shared args accounted for 53 8 and 87 6 of the total detected arg subtype numbers for leachate and stpads respectively the args represented by an average abundance of more than 1 0 10 4 ratio was drawn in the occupancy abundance plot fig 5b to split args into three arbitrarily defined categories i landfill leachate and stpads args generalists 79 args that were widely distributed in both at least 60 leachate 12 samples and 60 stpads 10 samples ii landfill leachate args generalists 26 args that appeared in at least 60 leachate samples but no more than 20 stpads three samples and iii stpads args generalists one arg that appeared in at least 60 stpads but no more than 20 leachate three samples fig 5b among the 79 landfill leachate and stpads args generalists sul1 sul2 ermf baca and aada were the five most abundant subtypes the abundance of these 79 arg generalists accounted for 72 2 94 0 mean 84 5 and 81 9 93 8 mean 87 7 of the total abundance of args in leachate and stpads respectively among the 26 landfill leachate args generalists aph 3 i was the most abundant one for stpads the sole arg generalists was tet43 3 5 characterization of microbial communities in total 327372 high quality sequences 15606 19906 per sample of 16s rrna gene were obtained table s8 these sequences were clustered into 4825 otus 432 1230 for each sample mean 813 at 97 similarity cutoff rarefaction curves showed a quite different pattern of microbial community diversity across all samples fig s7 which was confirmed when evaluated by the diversity index of chao 1 shannon and simpson table s8 calculated coverage ranging from 97 5 to 99 5 table s8 revealed that most communities were covered employing the current high throughput sequencing depth lin et al 2014 3 5 1 microbial community compositions at phylum level as shown in fig s8 more than 30 bacterial and archaeal phyla were detected in all the samples bacterial community was dominated by bacteroidetes proteobacteria firmicutes cloacimonetes and thermotogae while archaeal community was dominated by euryarchaeota notably bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes were the three most dominant bacterial phyla in the landfill leachate of yy fy sh 1 sh 2 tj hht and bt accounting for 39 1 95 6 of the total abundances for zh cz 1 and bj the bacterial community was dominated by proteobacteria and firmicutes and the total abundance of the two phyla in three samples was 88 3 63 0 and 50 9 respectively for the ltpas bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were the two most abundant phyla accounting for 33 6 56 8 of the total abundance while the communities of the ltpads were mainly comprised bacteroidetes 14 7 firmicutes 14 7 verrucomicrobia 13 3 and cloacimonetes 12 0 fig s8 for the archaeal community euryarchaeota was the most abundant phylum in all samples with the exception of the leachate from fy in which no euryarchaeota was identified at the current sequencing depth the abundance of euryarchaeota accounted for 0 48 25 7 0 07 2 62 and 26 1 in leachate ltpas and ltpads samples respectively 3 5 2 microbial community compositions at genus level among the 307 assigned genera in landfill leachate samples six genera including acholeplasma aminivibrio candidatus cloacamonas petrimonas sedimentibacter and tissierella were shared by all the 19 samples there were 102 rare genera that only appeared in one or two samples accounting for a different abundance ranges 0 006 30 0 of the microbial communities in leachate as shown in fig s9 the most abundant 10 genera were mainly classified into the phylum of proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and euryarchaeota generally the core microbiota among all the samples varied greatly for instance candidatus cloacamonas and syntrophomonas were the two most dominant genera in the leachate of sz 1 and sz 2 while defluviitoga was most abundant in the leachate of sz 4 cz 2 hht and xh notably seven archaeal genera methanobrevibacter methanocorpusculum methanoculleus methanofollis methanogenium methanosarcina methanothrix affiliated with euryarchaeota were abundant in most of the leachate and the sole ltpads samples 3 5 3 the similarities of the microbial community structures nmds was also conducted to evaluate the similarities of the microbial community structures among all the landfill leachate samples based on the otu abundance fig s10 similar to the arg compositions the ltpas samples were well separated from the leachate samples and the sole ltpads clustered closely with the leachate samples collected from the same city generally the samples from the same city were clustered closely such as sz cz sh and sz as however no obvious regional cluster of microbial community was observed for samples collected from north china east china central south china and south china 3 6 correlations of args with environmental factors water quality parameters and antibiotic concentrations of the leachate were summarized in table s9 and table s10 respectively pearson correlation analysis showed the concentrations of tn nh3 n tp cod toc and ec negatively correlated to the landfill ages p 0 05 table s11 likewise negative correlations between the concentrations of these water quality parameters and the arg abundance were found p 0 05 table s11 however landfill age was positively correlated with the total abundance of args p 0 01 table s11 in total 20 antibiotics belonging to seven classes sulfonamides fluoroquinolones tetracyclines beta lactams macrolide lincosamides trimethoprim and chloramphenicol were detected and the total concentrations ng l 1 of the seven major antibiotic classes in the leachate samples were 273 1 11017 3 273 2 15136 2 16 5 2407 1 19 8 413 9 838 7 13639 9 0 149 5 and 0 343 6 respectively table s10 the concentrations of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were negatively correlated with the total arg abundance p 0 01 while other antibiotic classes had no significant correlations with the arg abundance table s12 3 7 correlation of args with microbial community compositions procrustes analysis was used to investigate whether the args correlated with the microbial composition based on the nmds of both the arg profile and microbial community profile obtained via the otu based 16s rrna gene analysis approach as shown in fig 6 the analysis revealed a significant correlation m2 0 367 p 0 001 999 permutations between args profiles and microbial community profiles in different samples procrustes analysis could provide new insight for the overall correlations between args and the microbial community composition in landfill leachate however it cannot illustrate the detailed relations between the specific arg subtypes and microbial taxa the co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa deciphered by network analysis could provide an effective complement to the overall correlation information co occurrence patterns between args and microbial community were explored using network inference based on strong ρ 0 8 and significant p 0 01 correlations fig 7 the co occurrence patterns consisted of 127 nodes 32 microbial taxa and 95 args subtypes and 498 edges some topological properties widely used in network analysis were calculated to describe the complex pattern of interrelationships among args subtypes and microbial taxa text s2 the detailed co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa were summarized in table s13 based on the previous study li et al 2015 it was hypothesized that the nonrandom co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa could indicate the potential host information of args if the args and the co existed microbial taxa possessed the significantly similar abundance trends among the different samples ρ 0 8 p 0 01 as shown in fig 7 and table s13 16 bacterial genera and one archaea genus were speculated as the potential hosts of 47 agrs based on the co occurrence results among the 17 genera hydrogenophaga and thauera took along more diverse args 22 and 13 respectively than other genera for instance hydrogenophaga was found to have nonrandom connections with aminoglycoside resistance gene aada chloramphenicol resistance genes chloramphenicol exporter cmla and flor multidrug resistance genes acrb mdtf mexd mexw multidrug transporter smee ceob smeb amrb mexc mexi sdey and bpef sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 and tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc and tetg thauera was the possible host of resistance genes of mexw ceob amrb mexi and bpef all of which belongs to the multidrug resistance genes other bacterial taxa had connections with only one or two resistance genes for example adek was correlated with acinetobacter while tet37 and cfxa2 were correlated with bacteroides 3 8 co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes structural and statistical analyses demonstrate that nonrandom co occurrence patterns were evident within or across arg types fig 7 and table s6 for the arg subtypes from the same arg type multidrug 35 subtypes tetracycline 15 subtypes mls 12 subtypes aminoglycoside 9 subtypes chloramphenicol 7 subtypes beta lactam 6 subtypes and fosmidomycin 2 subtypes tended to co occur much more 44 5 than expected under random association 10 5 table s6 despite of their different degrees of intra type co occurrence as reflected by o r ratio especially multidrug mls and aminoglycoside resistance genes showed high possibility of non random co occurrence o 39 0 1 41 and 1 01 respectively than that of random positive association r 7 44 0 82 and 0 45 respectively and the inconsistencies were most pronounced in arg type of multidrug o r 5 25 moreover higher nonrandom co occurrence incidences were also observed for the arg subtypes among different arg types table s6 for example higher incidences of co occurrence than expected by chance were observed between arg subtypes of multidrug and chloramphenicol o 4 83 r 3 06 bacitracin o 3 82 r 0 44 sulfonamide o 3 02 r 1 31 quinolone o 1 81 r 0 44 as well as fosmidomycin o 3 42 r 0 87 similar co occurrence patterns were also observed between sulfonamide resistance genes and the args encoding aminoglycoside o 1 41 r 0 34 and chloramphenicol o 1 01 r 0 26 4 discussion 4 1 overview of args in landfill leachate using hts based metagenomics approach we firstly provided a comprehensive insight of the args occurring in landfill leachate from different cities in china a total of 526 arg subtypes belonging to 21 arg types were identified and the genes conferring resistance to sulfonamide mls aminoglycoside multidrug and tetracycline were the most abundant in the 19 leachate samples from 12 cities highlighting that landfill leachate is an important reservoir of args valuable insights have also been gained by pcr based approaches to investigate a few groups of args in landfill leachate table s14 wang et al 2015b wu et al 2015 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 su et al 2017a yi et al 2017 however these studies only covered a limited number of well studied arg types mainly including the resistance genes of sulfonamide tetracycline beta lactam and mls for arg subtypes 28 subtypes in total were covered in the args detection list in these previous studies table s14 accordingly the pcr based approaches provided a mere snapshot of the arg profiles in landfill leachate combining metagenomic analysis with sarg database 526 arg subtypes were detected in our study 1 2 orders of magnitude more arg subtypes than those detected in the leachate reported previously moreover the abundances of the 28 args reported previously accounted for 22 1 49 0 of total arg abundances in our study most of the args in our study have not been reported before indicating there are new findings using the novel approach therefore this could avoid the underestimation of arg profiles and provide more comprehensive data for assessing the ecological risks of args releasing from landfill leachate in previous studies the abundances of the detected args varied distinctly depending on the arg types and different landfills table s14 sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were generally more abundant than other args for instance wang et al 2015b reported that the abundance ranges of sul1 and sul2 in 12 leachate samples were 4 5 10 5 3 1 10 2 and 1 4 10 4 6 2 10 2 ratio respectively yi et al 2017 also detected a considerably higher abundance of sul1 and sul2 in the leachate from singapore with a range of 1 3 10 2 1 8 10 1 and 1 5 10 3 1 3 10 1 ratio respectively these findings were remarkably consistent with our results i e the abundance ranges of sul1 and sul2 in 19 leachate samples were 8 4 10 4 2 1 10 1 and 3 1 10 3 1 9 10 1 ratio respectively we found that the arg abundances in landfill leachate were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in sediments river as from stp stpas and stpads fig s11 moreover metagenomics analysis revealed the arg profiles in the leachate were different from those in other environments for example jia et al 2017 indicated tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes dominated in the swine wastewater and the downstream water while guo et al 2017 found the dominant arg types in the stpas were genes conferring resistance to beta lactams fluoroquinolones glycopeptides and sulfonamides the differences in the abundance and composition between leachate and other environmental samples may be associated with the complex formation process and unusual physico chemical properties of the leachate which could result in significantly different microbial community structures kjeldsen et al 2002 köchling et al 2015 wu et al 2017 in addition pal et al 2016 demonstrated that the variable abundances and types of resistance genes are partially governed by the selection pressure within each environment type in the present study sul1 sul2 aada and baca were the most abundant args in the leachate and the abundances of these genes were positively correlated to the total arg abundances r2 0 577 p 0 001 therefore the high abundances of these four args in the leachate can be served as potential arg indicators to predict total arg abundances in the leachate to indicate the total abundance of args in landfill leachate samples a simple and quick qpcr assay of sul1 sul2 aada and baca as the target genes could be used this will substantially save on the detection time and labor intensity for monitoring these args in leachate samples similarly the abundance of baca and aada as well as the sum of the abundances of the six most abundant args baca sul1 macb ermf mefa and aada in stpads was significantly positively correlated with the total arg abundances r2 0 519 p 0 001 fig s12 li et al 2015 once proposed that tetm and aminoglycoside resistance protein could act as the arg indicators to predict the quantity of the correspondingly co occurring args in various environments therefore this approach can be further investigated and validated using more datasets in subsequent studies in this study the arg profiles of ltpas of shenzhen and fenyi were also investigated the abundances and compositions of args in the ltpas of shenzhen significantly varied with that in the ltpas of fenyi the very high abundances of args especially sul1 and sul2 in the ltpas of fenyi may be linked with the operational parameters of the ltp however the higher arg abundance in the ltpas than those in corresponding leachate suggested that the treatment process of leachate might result in the enrichment of args fig s2 which may be related to the change of microbial community structure the arg profiles in as from ltp and stp was compared and there were obvious differences in the abundances and compositions of args between the two types of as fig s6 and fig s11 the different influent sources of ltp and stp might be the major reason which could cause the divergences of microbial community structure in the two as processes and then impact the resistome indirectly 4 2 influencing factors of args in landfill leachate generally the abundant and diverse arg types were associated with the antibiotics used extensively as human or veterinary medicine looft et al 2012 forslund et al 2014 args could have entered landfill directly or developed over time in the presence of antibiotic residues in msw then these may cause the presence of args in landfill leachate eggen et al 2010 yi et al 2017 in this study although antibiotics in the leachate had relatively high concentrations no significant correlations were found between most target antibiotics and their corresponding args suggesting direct selection of antibiotics might not be a key pressure shaping the resistome consistently previous studies confirmed that the types and levels of args and antibiotics did not depend on each other owing to different environmental fate and transport mechanisms of antibiotics and args in the leachate wu et al 2015 yi et al 2017 the fate of antibiotics tends to rely on hydrolysis sorption desorption and chemical biological degradation processes while the fate of args is likely to rely on bacterial host type wu et al 2015 yi et al 2017 contrary to our result su et al 2017a observed the abundance of sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were in accord with the antibiotic levels in the leachate yu et al 2016 reported that most studied antibiotics were positively correlated to the args and high levels of antibiotics forced severe selection pressure in the closed landfill environment therefore the relationship between args and the antibiotic concentrations is very complex and the enrichment of args may not be only contributed by the antibiotic selective pressure hu et al 2013 on the whole there was a negative correlation p 0 05 between the landfill age and almost all the measured water quality parameters including tn nh3 n tp toc cod and ec indeed landfill age has a significant effect on the leachate composition especially on organics and ammonia concentrations kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 however it has been confirmed that the leachate quality from the same landfill with the same landfill ages also varied indicating that the landfill is highly heterogeneous wang et al 2015b during the lifespan of a landfill the hydrology operation conditions of landfill e g drainage rate and disposal rate the amount composition and properties of msw may change continuously kjeldsen et al 2002 slack et al 2005 all these factors can affect leachate quantity leachate quality the microbial community and args in the leachate pearson correlation analysis also revealed negative correlation between water quality parameters and args p 0 05 in contrast landfill age was positively correlated with the total abundance of args p 0 01 similarly yu et al 2016 found that the carbon related parameters cod bod5 and doc held a decreasing tendency with the landfill age and were significantly negatively correlated to the args yi et al 2017 noted that old landfill site served as important reservoir of args however wang et al 2015b reported that the abundance of sul1 was negatively correlated to the landfill ages suggesting that the args decreased along time addition regardless of whether present in living or dead cells args which could move between microbes via horizontal gene transfer can survive in the landfills for years without the presence of their live hosts even after the selective pressure responsible for their formation has been removed song et al 2016 yu et al 2016 therefore landfill age can exert a powerful influence on the abundance of args in the leachate overall the differences of arg behavior and fate in the leachate among different landfills could be attributed to various factors such as refuse type landfill age landfilling patterns climate conditions and physico chemical properties of each landfill site threedeach et al 2012 wang et al 2015b su et al 2017a yi et al 2017 nevertheless the effects of some landfilling conditions i e the amount types and properties of msw temperatures inside landfills cover and drainage systems etc on the arg profiles of the leachate need to be further investigated because the information is not available in the present study although the environmental factors play certain roles in the presence of args it is noteworthy that microbes are the hosts of args it is well known that environmental conditions closely link to the variations of microbial community structure which is considered to be an important factor promoting the enhancement and spread of args novo et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in our study procrustes analysis suggested that arg profiles were significantly correlated with microbial community this indicated that microbial community compositions may be the determining factor of arg compositions in landfill leachate similar results by procrustes analysis were also reported regarding to the resistome of soil groundwater and stp forsberg et al 2014 found that resistome composition correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure both across and within soil types chen et al 2017 suggested that arg profiles were significantly p 0 001 correlated with bacterial community in the groundwater near msw landfill and further demonstrated that bacterial community shifts contributed 65 8 of the total arg variations using variation partitioning analysis in addition two recent studies also indicated that the stp core resistome is linked to the microbial community significantly p 0 001 munck et al 2015 su et al 2017b 4 3 co occurrence patterns among args and microbial taxa the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes revealed the incidences of nonrandom co occurrence of args within the same types e g multidrug mls and aminoglycoside or among different types e g multidrug and sulfonamide in landfill leachate our observations of nonrandom arg co occurrence patterns are well supported by recent evidences of significant positive correlations between arg subtypes of the same type or different types determined by qpcr sun et al 2014 johnson et al 2016 and metagenomic approaches ju et al 2016 jia et al 2017 higher incidences of co occurrence than random association between arg subtypes may generally reflect selective pressure exerted by the antibiotics in shaping antibiotic resistome sun et al 2014 ju et al 2016 in addition the intertypes co occurrence of args are more likely driven by the same resistance mechanism ju et al 2016 which is supported by our results that the genes of chloramphenicol exporter cmla mexw mdtf and amrb encoding antibiotic efflux proteins co occurred significantly and positively besides many novel pairwise examples revealed in our arg arg network fig 7 previous studies have also reported the co occurrence mechanisms of various arg subtypes such as i the resistance genes of tetracycline teta and aminoglycoside aph 3 vib aph 3 ib and aph 6 id encoded within the same genome isolated from a stp adamczuk and dziewit 2017 ii sul1 cat and aac 6 ib involved in the same multidrug resistance region of pkp368 10 plasmid bueno et al 2016 iii aada5 and dfra17 carried by a complete class 1 integron detected on an assembled scaffold of chicken feces ma et al 2016 iv gene cassette arrays conferring co resistance to aminoglycosides aada and aaca4 and beta lactams bla oxa 10 tacão et al 2014 and v sul2 dfra1 and cmla1 co occurred within the class 1 integrase and is6100 type transposons cluster in chinese swine farms johnson et al 2016 etc based on the previous study li et al 2015 it was hypothesized that the nonrandom co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa could indicate the possible host information of args if the args and the co existed microbial taxa possessed the significantly similar abundance trends among the different samples in other words one of the reasonable explanations of the corresponding similar abundance trends was because of some specific microbial taxa carrying some specific args which has been verified by forsberg s study 2014 in the present study network analysis revealed that 16 bacterial genera and one archaea genus were speculated as the hosts of 47 agrs in the leachate some arg hosts have been verified in previous studies for example acinetobacter the potential host of adek has been verified by several studies lopes and amyes 2013 sugawara and nikaido 2014 recently network analysis has been widely used to explore the potential hosts of args in different environments such as groundwater chen et al 2017 estuarine sediments zhu et al 2017 and stp guo et al 2017 therefore network analysis is a reasonable tool to provide us new insights into the args and their possible hosts in complex environmental samples li et al 2015 nevertheless the correlation between args and microbial community revealed by this approach need to be further validated using culture based method munir et al 2011 metagenomics assembly ma et al 2016 or function metagenomics approaches mullany 2014 4 4 comparison of arg profiles between landfill leachate and stpads to explore the characteristics of args in the typical anaerobic environments we compared the arg profiles between landfill leachate and stpads both of which are generated under anaerobic conditions nearly 90 args in the stpads were shared by the leachate and the abundant types in these two anaerobic engineering environments were similar this tendency was confirmed by occupancy abundance plot analysis indicating the abundances of args belonging to the leachate and stpads args generalists accounted for very high proportions about 85 of total abundances in these two types of anaerobic samples the anaerobic formation conditions of the leachate and stpads made them have similar microbial community structures which are the hosts of these shared or general args although microbial richness and evenness may be different the compositions of dominant phyla in the leachate were similar to those in the stpads in previous studies rivière et al 2009 yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 ju et al 2016 guo et al 2017 therefore microbial community may be the dominant factors in the distribution of args in the two anaerobic environments nevertheless it is essential to further explore the relations between args and microbial communities under anaerobic conditions and provide more information on the control of args in landfill leachate and stpads 5 conclusions the arg profiles in landfill leachate from 12 different cities in china were comprehensively characterized and compared with other types of environmental samples using hts based metagenomic approach landfill leachate harbored abundant and diverse args and acted as an important reservoir of args the total arg abundances in landfill leachate were significantly p 0 01 higher than those in sediments river stpas and stpads the resistance genes for sulfonamide mls aminoglycoside multidrug and tetracycline were the five most dominant arg types in the leachate no distinct regional distribution pattern of the args was found among the leachate samples from different cities while the arg compositions of the leachate were clearly different from those of other environments a prevalent core set of args including 79 subtypes was widely distributed in the two typical anaerobic environments leachate and stpads landfill age and water quality parameters played important roles in shaping args profiles in landfill leachate moreover the compositions of args were significantly correlated with microbial community and their strong and significant non random co occurrence patterns with args presents an appropriate approach to track the potential arg hosts in landfill leachate acknowledgements the authors thank the national

19698,field monitoring strategy is critical for disaster preparedness and watershed emergency environmental management however development of such is also highly challenging despite the efforts and progress thus far no definitive guidelines or solutions are available worldwide for quantitatively designing a monitoring network in response to river chemical spill incidents except general rules based on administrative divisions or arbitrary interpolation on routine monitoring sections to address this gap a novel framework for spatial temporal network design was proposed in this study the framework combines contaminant transport modelling with discrete entropy theory and spectral analysis the water quality model was applied to forecast the spatio temporal distribution of contaminant after spills and then corresponding information transfer indexes itis and fourier approximation periodic functions were estimated as critical measures for setting sampling locations and times the results indicate that the framework can produce scientific preparedness plans of emergency monitoring based on scenario analysis of spill risks as well as rapid design as soon as the incident happened but not prepared the framework was applied to a hypothetical spill case based on tracer experiment and a real nitrobenzene spill incident case to demonstrate its suitability and effectiveness the newly designed temporal spatial monitoring network captured major pollution information at relatively low costs it showed obvious benefits for follow up early warning and treatment as well as for aftermath recovery and assessment the underlying drivers of itis as well as the limitations and uncertainty of the approach were analyzed based on the case studies comparison with existing monitoring network design approaches management implications and generalized applicability were also discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords chemical spills emergency monitoring network discrete entropy theory information transfer index contaminant transport model fourier approximation 1 introduction in recent years an uphill trend has been observed in environmental accidents in watersheds and rivers around the world due to a variety of accelerating economic activities jiang et al 2012 cooper 2014 han et al 2016 river chemical spills cause great losses and are serious threats to human health and aquatic ecosystems during emergency responses information about the total amount of the chemical spilled and its concentration variation in the river are important factors for first responders it is necessary to follow a sound emergency monitoring strategy during emergency decision making in the emergency response guidelines officially published by the who and environmental protection agencies around the world e g usepa euepa and china epa emergency monitoring strategies are mainly administrative and usually focus on how to organize an emergency monitoring team only a very few strategies provide an operational management tool for responders to make a monitoring plan epa 2015 bartram and balance 1996 watkinson 2000 zhang et al 2010 loo et al 2012 for example according to the practical guide for water quality monitoring from who when an emergency monitoring activity is being started it is useful to begin with preliminary surveys bartram and balance 1996 including water quality characteristics the range of mixing zone and the potential emergency sampling sites euepa maria 2003 uses rapid screening techniques such as the small stream risk score approach to provide qualitative practical guideline to determine the location of mainstream monitoring sites and the frequencies of sampling however for such guidelines a precise design of monitoring is difficult to follow and oftentimes the monitoring essentially depends on the experience of the responders involved in practice to our knowledge the emergency monitoring network is normally designed using the arbitrary interpolation between routine water quality monitoring sites however the established state or provincial controlled water quality monitoring sites are almost always located at the boundary of two administrative regions i e transboundary monitoring whelton et al 2015 liu et al 2016 this obviously limits our ability to track pollution and risk early warning during the period of response jiang et al 2017 until now no quantitative guidelines have been made available in the literature and consequently the existing official standards to design an emergency monitoring network often lead to inadequate preparedness and scientific response routine water quality observations that focus on reporting and assessment of monthly or seasonal status of aquatic environments kumpel et al 2016 alarming of exceeding environmental standards shi et al 2017 total maximum daily load management telci et al 2009 play an important role in watershed management methods such as matter element analysis chen et al 2012 information theory harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 and genetic algorithms telci et al 2009 have been used in designing and optimizing routine monitoring networks in these methods hydrodynamics and the fate and transport of the contaminants normally play an important role in determining optimal monitoring locations behmel et al 2016 information theoretical techniques first introduced by shannon 1948 have been widely used in the analysis of nonlinear systems moniz et al 2007 applications of information theory concepts for designing routine surface water quality monitoring stations have gained significant attention over the past two decades or so uslu and tanriover 1979 harmancioglu 1981 harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 karamouz et al 2009 ozkul et al 2000 the main idea in such applications is to reduce the uncertainty i e the concept of information entropy associated with the estimation of variables of interest at the non monitored locations chapman et al 2016 layton et al 2016 for example mahjouri and kerachian 2011 developed a micro genetic algorithm based optimization model with the objective of minimizing weighted average spatio temporal information transfer indexes it is for a pre defined number of stations in hydrology entropy theory has developed as one of the most popular concepts for optimization assessment singh 2015 for example alfonso et al 2010a 2010b generated a time series with a very dense set of calculation points using a hydrodynamic model and then designed the monitoring networks to control polder water systems using information theory the spatio temporal transport of contaminant plume in a river can be regarded as a nonlinear system thomann and mueller 1987 a water quality model can characterize the evolution of the system based on different pollution inputs hydraulic conditions and background concentrations among others combining information theory and a contaminant transport model may perhaps provide a suitable solution for the design of an emergency monitoring network towards an accurate representation of the pollution transport process and at a low cost during incidents motivated by this the present study proposes a new framework to quantitatively design an emergency monitoring network and to provide a useful tool for emergency preparedness and response to river pollution incidents the framework integrates information entropy theory and spectral analysis with water quality modelling to design the spatio temporal monitoring network the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed framework is first demonstrated on a dye trace experiment and then tested on a real chemical spill incident comparison is made between the results of the two cases as well as with another network design method based on water quality modelling a preliminary theoretical analysis of entropy changes along with the water flow and uncertainty of the method are also discussed in the end management implications and future works are proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 information statistics information theory is a branch of applied mathematics electrical engineering and computer science involving the quantification storage and communication of information information theory was originally developed by shannon 1948 to find the fundamental limits of signal processing and communication operations such as data compression information entropy is one of the most important concepts in information theory and can be defined as the amount of information of a probability distribution of the events information entropy of a random variable x is a measure of the dispersion degree or uncertainty in it shannon 1948 rodrigues et al 2016 the larger the dispersion degree of the random variable the greater the information entropy the marginal entropy h x can be defined as the potential information of the variable and can be calculated as follows 1 h x i 1 n p x i ln p x i where x i i 1 2 n are the values of the discrete variable x p x i is the discrete probability of occurrence and ln p x i is the information content of the state x i x the joint entropy h x y indicates the total information content contained both in x and y and can be calculated as follows 2 h x y h x h y the mutual entropy t x y measures the redundant or mutual information between x and y i e transinformation and is calculated as follows mogheir et al 2004 3 t x y i 1 n j 1 m p x i y j ln p x i y j p x i p y j where p x i y i is the joint probability of x and y obviously t x y varies from 0 to marginal entropy h a better index of dependence called information transport index iti is defined after normalizing transinformation as follows 4 i t i t x y h x y it indicates the standardized information transferred from one variable to another and provides a direct and effective way of assessing the dependence of two random variables mogheir et al 2004 the units of information measures vary according the logarithm base used in the calculations in this study nats natural units as the logarithmic base is e is used since it is almost always adopted in the field of hydrology related mogheir et al 2004 a comprehensive account of the applications of entropy theory in hydraulic water engineering and environmental engineering are presented in singh 2015 2 2 the framework for emergency monitoring network design in this study random variables x and y represent two different states of the contaminant concentration distribution i e break through curves btcs jobson 1996 the leading edge and peak are two of the most important indexes depicting pollutant plume transport and indicate the arrival of pollutant plume and the highest pollution risk respectively according to the regression presented by jobson 1996 the travel time of the leading edge is generally about 89 of the travel time to the peak concentration in this study the concept of entropy was used to measure the information amount of btcs at potential monitoring sites firstly all the btcs were divided by the same number of subsets according to the time span morales et al 2007 then the discrete probability p x of each subset is calculated whereas the sum of total probability of a btc at one site is equal to 1 2 2 1 spatial information transfer index siti here the spatial information transfer index siti is the iti at each location along with the distance from the pollutant release point it can be calculated according to eq 4 and the siti relative to distance d can be expressed as follows 5 s i t i d s i t i 0 s i t i min exp k d s i t i min where s i t i 0 is the initial amount of information provided by the transfer index and is normally equal to 1 s i t i min is the minimum information transfer index at the end of the river reach d is the distance from pollutant spill point in km and k is the attenuation rate of information transfer the value of s i t i d is between 0 and 1 and negatively correlated with d in general the decline of information transfer along with distance obeys power law mahjouri and kerachian 2011 the locations of the monitoring sites can be designed according to the empirical principles of the optimal information transfer index as 10 of the two adjacent locations singh 2015 the potentially polluted river reach is firstly divided into m locations l downstream with distance interval δd monitoring site s was subsequently designed according to siti variations table 1 presents the detailed algorithm of how to quantitatively design monitoring network based on the entropy method 2 2 2 temporal information transfer index titi once the monitoring sites are confirmed the sampling time should be designed different sampling intervals will lead to different btcs i e capture different information of pollutant transport theoretically the finer the temporal grid and frequency of sampling the more precise the monitoring data describing the reality of pollutant transport in practice however a proper balance should be adopted between the monitoring cost and the resolution of btcs therefore the temporal information transfer index titi at a given monitoring site is defined as the iti of two monitored btcs with different sampling time intervals e g sampling every 60 min or sampling 120 min the information entropy of btc is calculated by eq 4 as well since the number of samples is different for each btc at this circumstance a piece wise linear interpolation was used to create btcs the titis vary with the sampling time interval and can be expressed as follows 6 t i t i δ t r 2 t i t i δ t 0 exp k δ t r t i t i δ t 0 where t i t i δ t r is the titi with time interval δ t r e g 5 mins t i t i δ t 0 is the initial iti and set to 1 and k is the attenuation rate of the information transfer eq 6 obeys power law as well one option for designing sampling time interval τ t i t i at the given monitoring site can be defined as 7 τ t i t i δ t r when t i t i δ t 0 t i t i δ t r 10 please refer to step 3 in table 1 for the detailed procedure it should be noted that the btc can also be divided into two segments by some critical points such as the peak of btc or the point with maximum entropy the optimal time interval can be calculated at different segments 2 2 3 optimal sampling frequency by spectral analysis of pollutant btcs since the 10 rule eq 7 is empirical and the time interval may be too coarse more compact alternatives are necessary therefore the shannon sampling theorem and spectral analysis trust region fourier transformation were used in this study to strengthen the design of sampling time according to the shannon sampling theorem the original signal can be reconstructed when the sampling frequency is greater than 2 times the highest frequency of the reconstruction signal which ensures that the original signal is within a permissible error range therefore the sampling time interval should not be more than the time span τbtc between the peak concentration and the leading edge which can be expressed by jobson 1996 8 τ b t c 0 11 d d a 0 152 d a 8 1 d a 0 595 q 1 d a d a 1 25 g q a 1 where d a is the drainage area in m2 q a is the mean annual river discharge in m3 q is the discharge at the site at the time of the measurement in m3 d a is the dimensionless drainage area and g is the acceleration due to gravity spectral analysis is widely used in the analysis of hydrological time series wu et al 2009 fourier transform is a method normally used in periodic signal analysis normally the btc can be approximated by fourier periodic functions we instinctively capture the minimum period of these series of periodic functions when determining the sampling time interval 9 f x a 0 a 1 cos ω x b 1 sin ω x a n cos n ω x b n sin n ω x we assume that btcs with different time intervals can be converted to a finite number of sine and cosine periodic functions under the condition of goodness of fit greater than 0 99 i e r2 0 99 therefore the maximum frequency of these periodic functions can be obtained as 10 τ f ourier π n ω where τ f ourier is half of the minimum period of the fourier function and n is the number of periodic functions when the goodness of fit is greater than 0 99 therefore the optimal sampling frequency and time interval is defined by 11 τ min τ t i t i τ b t c τ f ou r i e r where τ is the monitoring sampling time interval in min τ b t c is the length of time between the leading edge and the peak concentration in btc in min and τ t i t i is the time interval when the titi decreases to 0 90 2 2 4 the overall process of monitoring network design emergency monitoring is focused on the best representation of pollution trends of a river within the scope of disaster management it is linked to subsequent early warning and emergency treatment the overall process is presented in fig 1 it is applicable not only during the period of emergency planning preparation but also for in situ emergency response as soon as the spill scenarios are established at the stage of disaster preparedness the water quality model is applied to calculate the concentration field jiang et al 2012 and then the btcs are mathematically transformed into probability distributions to calculate discrete information entropy and spatiotemporal itis the one dimensional water quality model can typically be used for modelling the contaminant migration in rivers some of the popular models are mike 11 wasp qual 2k ce qual riv1 and ce qual w2 among others in this study the optimal information transfer index of two adjacent monitoring spatial and temporal scales was set at 10 considering the environmental sensitive receptors in the warning area jiang et al 2012 an emergency monitoring plan corresponding to the given spill scenario is finally produced in case the real spill happened the decision maker can employ a screening technology such as case based reasoning liu et al 2016 to match the most relative scenario in the case base plan database when the real spill is out of the range of the preparedness scenarios in time designing of monitoring network should be started 2 3 case studies two cases hypothetical spill case based on tracer experiment in usa and real nitrobenzene spill incident case in china were conducted to demonstrate the applicability and verify the rationality of this framework 2 3 1 truckee river dye studies case i the study area truckee river is located in nevada western united states fig 2 the truckee river watershed is a closed basin on the eastern slope of the sierra nevada along the california nevada border which originates from lake tahoe bateman 1977 the watershed drains approximately 8000 km2 and contains five major reservoirs including donner creek martis creek prosser creek and boca reservoir the truckee river and its tributaries supply approximately 85 of the total water to the cities of reno and sparks nevada tmwa 2012 the river reach of this study starts from tahoe city calif site 1 and continues to boca bridge near truckee calif site 6 the drainage area is approximately 2100 km2 for a 40 000 m long stretch of the truckee river that is approximately 130 000 m upstream of the mouth of the pyramid lake vista the elevation of the river from its outlet site 1 to its terminus site 6 decreases by more than 220 m the usgs conducted a dye tracing rhodamine experiment on may 22 24 2007 along the truckee river between tahoe city ca crompton 2008 in this experiment about 0 82 kg of fluorescent rhodamine wt dye was injected at site 1 fig 2 the sampling the resulting dye plume at locations downstream site 2 to site 6 the travel time was measured during medium flow conditions 4 0 18 0 m3 s crompton 2008 for the study river reach 5 sampling sites were selected downstream from the injection point historical observations of hydrologic data were collected from the usgs website for model calibration and validation the detail information of injection and sampling sites are described in table 2 2 3 2 songhua river nitrobenzene spill incident case ii the songhua river basin which is located in northeast china is the third largest river basin in china fig 3 its headstream has two sources the nen river north source and the second songhua river south source the two run confluent at sanchahe such that the main stream of the songhua river 939 km develops on november 13 2005 from 13 45 15 00 explosions occurred at the jilin petrochemical co plant in jilin city jilin province an estimated 100 tons of mixtures of benzene aniline and nitrobenzene with firewater were spilled into the songhua river as the pollutant plume flowed downstream the spill led to the suspension of the water supply of harbin the capital of heilongjiang province with 4 million people and a russian lawsuit against china unep 2005 wu 2006 we selected the reach which was from the baiqi monitoring station 75 km distance from the place of occurrence to the songhuajiang village monitoring station 155 km distance from the release point as the study area considering that chemical spill incidents have been occurring for approximately 10 years we can now use the proposed framework for post auditing emergency monitoring activity during the past 10 years huge or small spill incidents still happed and our research group joined the emergency response several times but the incidents are still not able to be scientifically and effectively prepared 3 results and discussion 3 1 case i emergency monitoring network design on hypothetical spills 3 1 1 contaminant transport modelling we assumed the pollutant released under the scenario of dye tracing experiment descripted in section 2 3 1 the mike 11 model developed by dhi water environment was used to forecast the contaminant transport in truckee river dhi 2007 the hydrodynamic process was firstly calibrated the time series data of water level and discharge at site 1 were used as the model upstream boundary condition whereas the time series data of water level and discharge of the same period at site 6 were used as the model downstream boundary condition the time step was set as 1 min during the calibration process of the hydrodynamic hd module the observation data of may 19 may 21 were used as training set and the data of may 22 may 24 were used as test set then the contaminant transport was forecasted using the advection dispersion ad module based on hydrodynamic outputs the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was calculated using the method of moments with historical datasets as in the investigation by rivord et al 2014 the pollutant was assumed as conservative solute and hence the decay coefficient equal to 0 fig 4 compared the forecasting and monitoring results of water discharge at site 3 and site 4 error statistics based results are shown in table 3 in general the result of the forecasting is close to the monitoring values the maximum relative errors were less than 6 10 and 3 45 at site 3 and site 4 respectively which is in good performance as shown in fig 5 for both leading edge and peak concentration the travelling times of forecasting and monitoring have no significant differences generally the difference between forecasting and monitoring travel time increases with the distance to the release point the largest travel time difference of the leading edge between forecasting and monitoring arrived at 94 min at site 6 the end of the given river reach rivord et al 2014 modeled contaminant spills in the truckee river by one dimensional solute transport model otis based on the same dye studies by crompton 2008 their results were similar to this study 3 1 2 iti calculation for the given spill scenario the spatial iti and temporal iti were then calculated according to the algorithm in table 1 for siti btcs with 5 min of time interval were abstracted from the modelling outputs sitis distribution were plotted in fig 6 it was obvious that the spatial itis values decreases along with the water flow two plateaus interestingly appeared on the curve segments between the green lines in fig 6 the first plateau located at 4665 m 9680 m from the release site where siti kept 0 80 approximately this was mainly attributed to the stable fluid state of streamflow in this stretch of truckee river as seen in fig 2 river reach at plateau 1 in front of site 2 is straight low slop and no tributary junction namely plug flow munson and okiishi 2006 moved the btcs downstream without changing the shapes hence the lowest change of information entropy the second plateau presented between 23 80 km and 28 00 km with stable siti of 0 65 it is after the confluence of donner creek tj 2 table 2 where discharge varied from 27 32 m3 s to 33 39 m3 s temporal itis of different monitoring time intervals at site 3 were plotted at fig 7 slight decay appeared along with the increasing of monitoring time interval the total titi decreased about 10 from 15 min to 600 min of monitoring time interval the monitored btcs of different time intervals in site 3 are shown in fig 8 the overall curved shape tends to be coarser with the increase of time interval while their distributions are similar it was consistent with the change of information entropy as shown in fig 7 which almost keep to the same value 4 35 nat this indicates that when the temporal iti decreased to 0 90 i e upper titi change should be less than 10 the optimal sampling time interval was 600 min to compact the optimal sampling interval τbtc and τfourier were further calculated section 2 2 3 τ b t c 0 11 d d a 0 152 d a 8 1 d a 0 595 q 1 170 mins results indicates that the maximum frequency of fourier approximation periodic functions was f n ω 0 104 h z and hence the minimum period was t 2 π f 1 60 4 mins therefore the optimal sampling time interval defined by fourier function was τ f ourier 0 5 t 30 2 mins 3 1 3 monitoring network design base on the above calculation the emergency monitoring network with regard to the given release scenario was designed according to the rules illustrated in section 2 2 4 sensitive receptors like residential center water intakes bureau of the census 2010 were considered along the river it is critical to prevent them safe from contamination as shown in fig 9 7 monitoring sites was set according to the iti changes ns1 ns3 ns4 ns5 ns9 ns10 and ns11 and 4 sites were chosen due to sensitive receptors ns2 ns6 ns7 and ns8 sampling period of each sites were also presented in fig 9 the optimal sampling time interval was set as τ min τ t i t i τ b t c τ f ou r i e r 30 2 mins and taken 30 min in practice 3 2 case ii emergency monitoring network design on real spill incidents after the nitrobenzene spill occurred at nov 24 2005 the provincial environmental protection agency epa immediately activated the emergency monitoring and started monitoring benzene and nitrobenzene concentrations based on the state routine monitoring stations fig 10 samples were taken at every two hours before the plume arrival and at every one hour during the plume passed through each cross section unep 2005 as a post audit the proposed monitoring network design approach can also be used to assess the rationality of the historical monitoring action in practice the rma2 and rma4 model package in surface water modelling system sms were used to model the travel of the contaminant plume in the river jiang et al 2012 the initial parameters of rma2 and rma4 models such as initial water surface elevation flow rate under steady flow and the initial nitrobenzene concentration were monitored by harbin epa the two model were both solved by the finite element method using the galerkin method of weighted residuals results showed that the mean value of relative error between the simulated and observed at songhuajiang village monitoring station is 0 3541 gao et al 2009 to be notice it is more a calibration rather than predication since only one group of observation data available to adjust dispersion coefficient decay coefficient etc as shown in fig 10 the spatial iti decreased from 1 to 0 53 downstream according to the 10 rule of iti decrease between two adjacent monitoring sites two new emergency monitoring sites were added besides the state routine monitoring stations fig 3 the interpolated monitoring site 1 was located between baiqi and hougang village and site 2 was located between hougang village and yushumiao referring to the terrestrial condition images in fig 3 and the location of sensitive receptors the two new monitoring sites were set at about 8 km and 49 km from baiqi site respectively for all the sites the titi defined sampling time interval τ i t i 240 mins the btc defined τ b t c 450 mins and spectral analysis defined τ f ourier 0 5 t π n ω 60 5 mins therefore the optimal sampling time interval τ was set as the minimum 60 5 min and in practice 60 min is adopted it was coincident with the historical sampling time interval used by the local provincial epa the quantitatively designed monitoring plan was illustrated by fig 3 3 3 comparison and discussion 3 3 1 comparison between the two cases in the both cases the monitoring networks were successfully designed comparison was made and listed at table 4 for the number of monitoring sites calculated by iti there are 7 sites at the length of 40 km for case i and 6 sites at the length of 80 km for case ii site density in case i is almost two times of that in case ii this difference can be explained by the characteristics of siti decay although case i is on the low flow condition the pollutant diffusion process is stronger than case ii accelerating the decay of siti the sampling time interval in case ii is 60 min which is two times of that in case i because study area in case i covers the release point such that the shape of btcs at downstream sites are narrower than that in case ii a more fundamental discussion is bellowing 3 3 2 theoretical analysis on entropy changes and uncertainty the proposed framework in this work is based on the entropy variation process controlled by advection diffusion reaction adr system information entropy changes in diffusion process was as early as discussed in 1983 by senf 1983 senf pointed out that the differential entropy with the same formula of discrete information entropy increased with time and could attain a maximum at equilibrium due to that the initial distribution of the diffusion is the least probable whilst equipartition status is the most probable an optimal moment exists in the measurement of time dependent information content processes kitanidis 1994 introduced the dilution index e to quantify dilution and reactive mixing in solute transport problems chiogna and rolle 2017 extended the dilution index e to the concept of critical reaction time considering mixing and reaction these studies provided foundation for theoretical analysis of information entropy changes for pollutant mixing transport in river it is consistent with the classical curve of entropy changes within physical processes that h increase initially from 0 then arrive at maximum entropy and finally descend to 0 fig 11 due to the long tail effects of adr process h curve also presents a long tail trends to zero the theoretical maximum entropy hmax lnn n is the number of subsets of a btc profile when the system arrived average distribution however due to the control of adr process lnn will never been arrived and the curves of h variation belong to a special functional like in chiogna and rolle 2017 we can herein define the site with largest entropy as critical site which can be adopted as an alternative to describe the characteristic length of spill incidents jiang et al 2017 the critical site can add in the monitoring network where monitoring equipment or online monitoring station expensive can be installed the change of controlling parameters of water quality model diffusion coefficient d x flow speed u degradation coefficient k and source term m directly lead to attenuation of entropy h and siti fig 11 presented how parameters of water quality model impact the h and siti evolution setting scenario with d0 u0 k0 and m0 as a baseline we next analyzed how h and siti curves change along with different water quality parameters when d x d0 i e the pollutant plume disperse faster the information entropy increase faster and the siti decrease faster when u u0 i e the pollutant plume transport faster and diffusion happen slower relatively the h curve moves forward compared with baseline scenario both conservative and non conservative pollutant share the same h curves but pollutant decay impacts siti curves since the total mass of pollutant is different namely the information decay for source term m it do not impact h curve like k does and it still keep the same curve of iti for different pollutant loading differing from k it is easy to understand the opposite situation when d x d0 u u0 k k0 those fundamental qualitative rules is not only important for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of network design but also linking with assumption on different scenarios i e various flow condition release pattern pollutant characteristics river morphology and so on comprehensive quantitative analysis will be reported in another paper 3 3 3 methodology comparison with other network design methods based on water quality model in this work entropy theory and water quality model are skillfully integrated serving to the emergency management of pollution risks on watershed under this circumstance the presented framework of monitoring network design herein focused on how to track the information of pollutant plumes transport rather than the routine observation on or representation of the environmental quality of the whole watershed karamouz et al 2009 chen et al 2012 puri et al 2017 the function of water quality modelling among those studies can be divided into two types 1 extension of monitoring data e g chen et al 2012 combined delfte3d with matter element analyses 2 utilizing model performance index as one objective for optimization e g puri et al 2017 combined sparrow and fluxmaster with genetic algorithm to remove unimportant stations for observing and assessing e coli loads in our work the function of water quality modelling can be defined as type 3 that producing potential monitoring data for monitoring network design aiming to routine observation where the issue is formulized as an optimization problem and entropy theory are usually combined with optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm and bayesian framework for example weighted spatial and temporal iti were linked with optimization objective strobl and robillard 2008 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 and violation entropy and total system entropy were adopted as the criteria in a multiple attribute decision making process alameddine et al 2013 in this work an empirical 10 rule was used for deduction on iti i e optimization it is a bit more subjective compared to abovementioned studies but it works it is meaningful in the future to enable watershed managers to prioritize specific objectives and constraints related to the cost of monitoring risk assessment and emergency treatment 3 3 4 method limitations some limitations of the proposed framework were then discussed since modelling performance significant impact the design process model calibration and verification is important in practice although it is costly for large rivers 2d model or 3d model may necessary containment transport in multimedia ambient water sediment and air were not considered in this study again design of temporal sampling in period of emergency response is a little tricky here 5 rules and 10 rules are subjective moreover the underlying drivers to the variation of fourier coefficients also need to be investigated theoretically in the further study 3 4 management implications the proposed approach specifically target at emergency management and the purpose of emergency monitoring stations here is significantly different from that of hydrological observation stations scientific observation or flood forecasting or normal monitoring stations administration it is also different from the purpose of monitoring stations designed for water quality early warning system environment institute s r o 2014 which focuses on abnormal detection of water quality variation and alarming shi et al 2017 this novel framework helps with collecting the essential data to scientific assessment of real time risks during incidents jiang et al 2012 this need cannot be meet by traditional emergency monitoring designing that the intuitively interpolation between routine water quality monitoring sites as a decision tool for disaster preparedness it is critical to assume all kinds of potential pollution scenarios and parameterization response and migration onto sudden pollution incidents are risk oriented watershed management while routine observation serving for normal management such as tdml thomann and mueller 1987 therefore the sensitive receptors like residential center and water intakes in the administrative area have to been considered in the proposed framework administrative regions were also considered as priority protected objects due to environmental forensic the starting time and sampling time interval of emergency monitoring are usually restricted to human resources and equipment available from the local government in addition the concentration of the leading edge and the surface water environmental standards should be both considered the former is in the scope of contaminant hydrology or water quality modelling while the latter is in the scope of environmental management if any of them to be exceeded monitoring activity should be started the proposed method is generic and applicable for watershed management in different countries around the world it is particularly useful for transboundary management such as danube river at europe pinter 1999 chapman et al 2016 tisza river basin at slovak republic environment institute s r o 2014 tanos et al 2015 elk river in west virginia usa cooper 2014 4 conclusions in this study a first framework was proposed to quantitatively design the emergency monitoring network for contaminant spill incidents in rivers that combing contaminant transport modelling with discrete entropy theory and spectral analysis contaminant transport model provides the potential information of spatiotemporal distribution of contaminant in rivers discrete spatial information transfer index for btcs i e potential pollution information defined the monitoring locations while temporal information transfer index at a given monitoring site defined the sampling frequency spectral analysis on btcs and shannon sampling theorem were used to further compact the sampling frequency the two case studies the dye tracing experiment in a small river and historical nitrobenzene spill in a big river explained and justified the applicability in practices the results indicate that the proposed approach can be used as an effective tool both for preparedness and in situ response water quality model can provide three functions for network design extension monitoring data production potential monitoring data and infusion model performance into an optimization objective preliminary theoretical analysis on entropy changes on the advection diffusion reaction system uncovered basic rules of iti evolving downstream the concept of critical site was proposed and defined where btc has the maximum entropy it is helpful for setting expensive online monitoring stations uncertainty on flow speed diffusion coefficient decay coefficient and source term in water quality model lead to various uncertainty of network design these parameters also classify the different spill incident scenario future works on emergency management practices e g human resource and training needs comprehensive

19698,field monitoring strategy is critical for disaster preparedness and watershed emergency environmental management however development of such is also highly challenging despite the efforts and progress thus far no definitive guidelines or solutions are available worldwide for quantitatively designing a monitoring network in response to river chemical spill incidents except general rules based on administrative divisions or arbitrary interpolation on routine monitoring sections to address this gap a novel framework for spatial temporal network design was proposed in this study the framework combines contaminant transport modelling with discrete entropy theory and spectral analysis the water quality model was applied to forecast the spatio temporal distribution of contaminant after spills and then corresponding information transfer indexes itis and fourier approximation periodic functions were estimated as critical measures for setting sampling locations and times the results indicate that the framework can produce scientific preparedness plans of emergency monitoring based on scenario analysis of spill risks as well as rapid design as soon as the incident happened but not prepared the framework was applied to a hypothetical spill case based on tracer experiment and a real nitrobenzene spill incident case to demonstrate its suitability and effectiveness the newly designed temporal spatial monitoring network captured major pollution information at relatively low costs it showed obvious benefits for follow up early warning and treatment as well as for aftermath recovery and assessment the underlying drivers of itis as well as the limitations and uncertainty of the approach were analyzed based on the case studies comparison with existing monitoring network design approaches management implications and generalized applicability were also discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords chemical spills emergency monitoring network discrete entropy theory information transfer index contaminant transport model fourier approximation 1 introduction in recent years an uphill trend has been observed in environmental accidents in watersheds and rivers around the world due to a variety of accelerating economic activities jiang et al 2012 cooper 2014 han et al 2016 river chemical spills cause great losses and are serious threats to human health and aquatic ecosystems during emergency responses information about the total amount of the chemical spilled and its concentration variation in the river are important factors for first responders it is necessary to follow a sound emergency monitoring strategy during emergency decision making in the emergency response guidelines officially published by the who and environmental protection agencies around the world e g usepa euepa and china epa emergency monitoring strategies are mainly administrative and usually focus on how to organize an emergency monitoring team only a very few strategies provide an operational management tool for responders to make a monitoring plan epa 2015 bartram and balance 1996 watkinson 2000 zhang et al 2010 loo et al 2012 for example according to the practical guide for water quality monitoring from who when an emergency monitoring activity is being started it is useful to begin with preliminary surveys bartram and balance 1996 including water quality characteristics the range of mixing zone and the potential emergency sampling sites euepa maria 2003 uses rapid screening techniques such as the small stream risk score approach to provide qualitative practical guideline to determine the location of mainstream monitoring sites and the frequencies of sampling however for such guidelines a precise design of monitoring is difficult to follow and oftentimes the monitoring essentially depends on the experience of the responders involved in practice to our knowledge the emergency monitoring network is normally designed using the arbitrary interpolation between routine water quality monitoring sites however the established state or provincial controlled water quality monitoring sites are almost always located at the boundary of two administrative regions i e transboundary monitoring whelton et al 2015 liu et al 2016 this obviously limits our ability to track pollution and risk early warning during the period of response jiang et al 2017 until now no quantitative guidelines have been made available in the literature and consequently the existing official standards to design an emergency monitoring network often lead to inadequate preparedness and scientific response routine water quality observations that focus on reporting and assessment of monthly or seasonal status of aquatic environments kumpel et al 2016 alarming of exceeding environmental standards shi et al 2017 total maximum daily load management telci et al 2009 play an important role in watershed management methods such as matter element analysis chen et al 2012 information theory harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 and genetic algorithms telci et al 2009 have been used in designing and optimizing routine monitoring networks in these methods hydrodynamics and the fate and transport of the contaminants normally play an important role in determining optimal monitoring locations behmel et al 2016 information theoretical techniques first introduced by shannon 1948 have been widely used in the analysis of nonlinear systems moniz et al 2007 applications of information theory concepts for designing routine surface water quality monitoring stations have gained significant attention over the past two decades or so uslu and tanriover 1979 harmancioglu 1981 harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 karamouz et al 2009 ozkul et al 2000 the main idea in such applications is to reduce the uncertainty i e the concept of information entropy associated with the estimation of variables of interest at the non monitored locations chapman et al 2016 layton et al 2016 for example mahjouri and kerachian 2011 developed a micro genetic algorithm based optimization model with the objective of minimizing weighted average spatio temporal information transfer indexes it is for a pre defined number of stations in hydrology entropy theory has developed as one of the most popular concepts for optimization assessment singh 2015 for example alfonso et al 2010a 2010b generated a time series with a very dense set of calculation points using a hydrodynamic model and then designed the monitoring networks to control polder water systems using information theory the spatio temporal transport of contaminant plume in a river can be regarded as a nonlinear system thomann and mueller 1987 a water quality model can characterize the evolution of the system based on different pollution inputs hydraulic conditions and background concentrations among others combining information theory and a contaminant transport model may perhaps provide a suitable solution for the design of an emergency monitoring network towards an accurate representation of the pollution transport process and at a low cost during incidents motivated by this the present study proposes a new framework to quantitatively design an emergency monitoring network and to provide a useful tool for emergency preparedness and response to river pollution incidents the framework integrates information entropy theory and spectral analysis with water quality modelling to design the spatio temporal monitoring network the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed framework is first demonstrated on a dye trace experiment and then tested on a real chemical spill incident comparison is made between the results of the two cases as well as with another network design method based on water quality modelling a preliminary theoretical analysis of entropy changes along with the water flow and uncertainty of the method are also discussed in the end management implications and future works are proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 information statistics information theory is a branch of applied mathematics electrical engineering and computer science involving the quantification storage and communication of information information theory was originally developed by shannon 1948 to find the fundamental limits of signal processing and communication operations such as data compression information entropy is one of the most important concepts in information theory and can be defined as the amount of information of a probability distribution of the events information entropy of a random variable x is a measure of the dispersion degree or uncertainty in it shannon 1948 rodrigues et al 2016 the larger the dispersion degree of the random variable the greater the information entropy the marginal entropy h x can be defined as the potential information of the variable and can be calculated as follows 1 h x i 1 n p x i ln p x i where x i i 1 2 n are the values of the discrete variable x p x i is the discrete probability of occurrence and ln p x i is the information content of the state x i x the joint entropy h x y indicates the total information content contained both in x and y and can be calculated as follows 2 h x y h x h y the mutual entropy t x y measures the redundant or mutual information between x and y i e transinformation and is calculated as follows mogheir et al 2004 3 t x y i 1 n j 1 m p x i y j ln p x i y j p x i p y j where p x i y i is the joint probability of x and y obviously t x y varies from 0 to marginal entropy h a better index of dependence called information transport index iti is defined after normalizing transinformation as follows 4 i t i t x y h x y it indicates the standardized information transferred from one variable to another and provides a direct and effective way of assessing the dependence of two random variables mogheir et al 2004 the units of information measures vary according the logarithm base used in the calculations in this study nats natural units as the logarithmic base is e is used since it is almost always adopted in the field of hydrology related mogheir et al 2004 a comprehensive account of the applications of entropy theory in hydraulic water engineering and environmental engineering are presented in singh 2015 2 2 the framework for emergency monitoring network design in this study random variables x and y represent two different states of the contaminant concentration distribution i e break through curves btcs jobson 1996 the leading edge and peak are two of the most important indexes depicting pollutant plume transport and indicate the arrival of pollutant plume and the highest pollution risk respectively according to the regression presented by jobson 1996 the travel time of the leading edge is generally about 89 of the travel time to the peak concentration in this study the concept of entropy was used to measure the information amount of btcs at potential monitoring sites firstly all the btcs were divided by the same number of subsets according to the time span morales et al 2007 then the discrete probability p x of each subset is calculated whereas the sum of total probability of a btc at one site is equal to 1 2 2 1 spatial information transfer index siti here the spatial information transfer index siti is the iti at each location along with the distance from the pollutant release point it can be calculated according to eq 4 and the siti relative to distance d can be expressed as follows 5 s i t i d s i t i 0 s i t i min exp k d s i t i min where s i t i 0 is the initial amount of information provided by the transfer index and is normally equal to 1 s i t i min is the minimum information transfer index at the end of the river reach d is the distance from pollutant spill point in km and k is the attenuation rate of information transfer the value of s i t i d is between 0 and 1 and negatively correlated with d in general the decline of information transfer along with distance obeys power law mahjouri and kerachian 2011 the locations of the monitoring sites can be designed according to the empirical principles of the optimal information transfer index as 10 of the two adjacent locations singh 2015 the potentially polluted river reach is firstly divided into m locations l downstream with distance interval δd monitoring site s was subsequently designed according to siti variations table 1 presents the detailed algorithm of how to quantitatively design monitoring network based on the entropy method 2 2 2 temporal information transfer index titi once the monitoring sites are confirmed the sampling time should be designed different sampling intervals will lead to different btcs i e capture different information of pollutant transport theoretically the finer the temporal grid and frequency of sampling the more precise the monitoring data describing the reality of pollutant transport in practice however a proper balance should be adopted between the monitoring cost and the resolution of btcs therefore the temporal information transfer index titi at a given monitoring site is defined as the iti of two monitored btcs with different sampling time intervals e g sampling every 60 min or sampling 120 min the information entropy of btc is calculated by eq 4 as well since the number of samples is different for each btc at this circumstance a piece wise linear interpolation was used to create btcs the titis vary with the sampling time interval and can be expressed as follows 6 t i t i δ t r 2 t i t i δ t 0 exp k δ t r t i t i δ t 0 where t i t i δ t r is the titi with time interval δ t r e g 5 mins t i t i δ t 0 is the initial iti and set to 1 and k is the attenuation rate of the information transfer eq 6 obeys power law as well one option for designing sampling time interval τ t i t i at the given monitoring site can be defined as 7 τ t i t i δ t r when t i t i δ t 0 t i t i δ t r 10 please refer to step 3 in table 1 for the detailed procedure it should be noted that the btc can also be divided into two segments by some critical points such as the peak of btc or the point with maximum entropy the optimal time interval can be calculated at different segments 2 2 3 optimal sampling frequency by spectral analysis of pollutant btcs since the 10 rule eq 7 is empirical and the time interval may be too coarse more compact alternatives are necessary therefore the shannon sampling theorem and spectral analysis trust region fourier transformation were used in this study to strengthen the design of sampling time according to the shannon sampling theorem the original signal can be reconstructed when the sampling frequency is greater than 2 times the highest frequency of the reconstruction signal which ensures that the original signal is within a permissible error range therefore the sampling time interval should not be more than the time span τbtc between the peak concentration and the leading edge which can be expressed by jobson 1996 8 τ b t c 0 11 d d a 0 152 d a 8 1 d a 0 595 q 1 d a d a 1 25 g q a 1 where d a is the drainage area in m2 q a is the mean annual river discharge in m3 q is the discharge at the site at the time of the measurement in m3 d a is the dimensionless drainage area and g is the acceleration due to gravity spectral analysis is widely used in the analysis of hydrological time series wu et al 2009 fourier transform is a method normally used in periodic signal analysis normally the btc can be approximated by fourier periodic functions we instinctively capture the minimum period of these series of periodic functions when determining the sampling time interval 9 f x a 0 a 1 cos ω x b 1 sin ω x a n cos n ω x b n sin n ω x we assume that btcs with different time intervals can be converted to a finite number of sine and cosine periodic functions under the condition of goodness of fit greater than 0 99 i e r2 0 99 therefore the maximum frequency of these periodic functions can be obtained as 10 τ f ourier π n ω where τ f ourier is half of the minimum period of the fourier function and n is the number of periodic functions when the goodness of fit is greater than 0 99 therefore the optimal sampling frequency and time interval is defined by 11 τ min τ t i t i τ b t c τ f ou r i e r where τ is the monitoring sampling time interval in min τ b t c is the length of time between the leading edge and the peak concentration in btc in min and τ t i t i is the time interval when the titi decreases to 0 90 2 2 4 the overall process of monitoring network design emergency monitoring is focused on the best representation of pollution trends of a river within the scope of disaster management it is linked to subsequent early warning and emergency treatment the overall process is presented in fig 1 it is applicable not only during the period of emergency planning preparation but also for in situ emergency response as soon as the spill scenarios are established at the stage of disaster preparedness the water quality model is applied to calculate the concentration field jiang et al 2012 and then the btcs are mathematically transformed into probability distributions to calculate discrete information entropy and spatiotemporal itis the one dimensional water quality model can typically be used for modelling the contaminant migration in rivers some of the popular models are mike 11 wasp qual 2k ce qual riv1 and ce qual w2 among others in this study the optimal information transfer index of two adjacent monitoring spatial and temporal scales was set at 10 considering the environmental sensitive receptors in the warning area jiang et al 2012 an emergency monitoring plan corresponding to the given spill scenario is finally produced in case the real spill happened the decision maker can employ a screening technology such as case based reasoning liu et al 2016 to match the most relative scenario in the case base plan database when the real spill is out of the range of the preparedness scenarios in time designing of monitoring network should be started 2 3 case studies two cases hypothetical spill case based on tracer experiment in usa and real nitrobenzene spill incident case in china were conducted to demonstrate the applicability and verify the rationality of this framework 2 3 1 truckee river dye studies case i the study area truckee river is located in nevada western united states fig 2 the truckee river watershed is a closed basin on the eastern slope of the sierra nevada along the california nevada border which originates from lake tahoe bateman 1977 the watershed drains approximately 8000 km2 and contains five major reservoirs including donner creek martis creek prosser creek and boca reservoir the truckee river and its tributaries supply approximately 85 of the total water to the cities of reno and sparks nevada tmwa 2012 the river reach of this study starts from tahoe city calif site 1 and continues to boca bridge near truckee calif site 6 the drainage area is approximately 2100 km2 for a 40 000 m long stretch of the truckee river that is approximately 130 000 m upstream of the mouth of the pyramid lake vista the elevation of the river from its outlet site 1 to its terminus site 6 decreases by more than 220 m the usgs conducted a dye tracing rhodamine experiment on may 22 24 2007 along the truckee river between tahoe city ca crompton 2008 in this experiment about 0 82 kg of fluorescent rhodamine wt dye was injected at site 1 fig 2 the sampling the resulting dye plume at locations downstream site 2 to site 6 the travel time was measured during medium flow conditions 4 0 18 0 m3 s crompton 2008 for the study river reach 5 sampling sites were selected downstream from the injection point historical observations of hydrologic data were collected from the usgs website for model calibration and validation the detail information of injection and sampling sites are described in table 2 2 3 2 songhua river nitrobenzene spill incident case ii the songhua river basin which is located in northeast china is the third largest river basin in china fig 3 its headstream has two sources the nen river north source and the second songhua river south source the two run confluent at sanchahe such that the main stream of the songhua river 939 km develops on november 13 2005 from 13 45 15 00 explosions occurred at the jilin petrochemical co plant in jilin city jilin province an estimated 100 tons of mixtures of benzene aniline and nitrobenzene with firewater were spilled into the songhua river as the pollutant plume flowed downstream the spill led to the suspension of the water supply of harbin the capital of heilongjiang province with 4 million people and a russian lawsuit against china unep 2005 wu 2006 we selected the reach which was from the baiqi monitoring station 75 km distance from the place of occurrence to the songhuajiang village monitoring station 155 km distance from the release point as the study area considering that chemical spill incidents have been occurring for approximately 10 years we can now use the proposed framework for post auditing emergency monitoring activity during the past 10 years huge or small spill incidents still happed and our research group joined the emergency response several times but the incidents are still not able to be scientifically and effectively prepared 3 results and discussion 3 1 case i emergency monitoring network design on hypothetical spills 3 1 1 contaminant transport modelling we assumed the pollutant released under the scenario of dye tracing experiment descripted in section 2 3 1 the mike 11 model developed by dhi water environment was used to forecast the contaminant transport in truckee river dhi 2007 the hydrodynamic process was firstly calibrated the time series data of water level and discharge at site 1 were used as the model upstream boundary condition whereas the time series data of water level and discharge of the same period at site 6 were used as the model downstream boundary condition the time step was set as 1 min during the calibration process of the hydrodynamic hd module the observation data of may 19 may 21 were used as training set and the data of may 22 may 24 were used as test set then the contaminant transport was forecasted using the advection dispersion ad module based on hydrodynamic outputs the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was calculated using the method of moments with historical datasets as in the investigation by rivord et al 2014 the pollutant was assumed as conservative solute and hence the decay coefficient equal to 0 fig 4 compared the forecasting and monitoring results of water discharge at site 3 and site 4 error statistics based results are shown in table 3 in general the result of the forecasting is close to the monitoring values the maximum relative errors were less than 6 10 and 3 45 at site 3 and site 4 respectively which is in good performance as shown in fig 5 for both leading edge and peak concentration the travelling times of forecasting and monitoring have no significant differences generally the difference between forecasting and monitoring travel time increases with the distance to the release point the largest travel time difference of the leading edge between forecasting and monitoring arrived at 94 min at site 6 the end of the given river reach rivord et al 2014 modeled contaminant spills in the truckee river by one dimensional solute transport model otis based on the same dye studies by crompton 2008 their results were similar to this study 3 1 2 iti calculation for the given spill scenario the spatial iti and temporal iti were then calculated according to the algorithm in table 1 for siti btcs with 5 min of time interval were abstracted from the modelling outputs sitis distribution were plotted in fig 6 it was obvious that the spatial itis values decreases along with the water flow two plateaus interestingly appeared on the curve segments between the green lines in fig 6 the first plateau located at 4665 m 9680 m from the release site where siti kept 0 80 approximately this was mainly attributed to the stable fluid state of streamflow in this stretch of truckee river as seen in fig 2 river reach at plateau 1 in front of site 2 is straight low slop and no tributary junction namely plug flow munson and okiishi 2006 moved the btcs downstream without changing the shapes hence the lowest change of information entropy the second plateau presented between 23 80 km and 28 00 km with stable siti of 0 65 it is after the confluence of donner creek tj 2 table 2 where discharge varied from 27 32 m3 s to 33 39 m3 s temporal itis of different monitoring time intervals at site 3 were plotted at fig 7 slight decay appeared along with the increasing of monitoring time interval the total titi decreased about 10 from 15 min to 600 min of monitoring time interval the monitored btcs of different time intervals in site 3 are shown in fig 8 the overall curved shape tends to be coarser with the increase of time interval while their distributions are similar it was consistent with the change of information entropy as shown in fig 7 which almost keep to the same value 4 35 nat this indicates that when the temporal iti decreased to 0 90 i e upper titi change should be less than 10 the optimal sampling time interval was 600 min to compact the optimal sampling interval τbtc and τfourier were further calculated section 2 2 3 τ b t c 0 11 d d a 0 152 d a 8 1 d a 0 595 q 1 170 mins results indicates that the maximum frequency of fourier approximation periodic functions was f n ω 0 104 h z and hence the minimum period was t 2 π f 1 60 4 mins therefore the optimal sampling time interval defined by fourier function was τ f ourier 0 5 t 30 2 mins 3 1 3 monitoring network design base on the above calculation the emergency monitoring network with regard to the given release scenario was designed according to the rules illustrated in section 2 2 4 sensitive receptors like residential center water intakes bureau of the census 2010 were considered along the river it is critical to prevent them safe from contamination as shown in fig 9 7 monitoring sites was set according to the iti changes ns1 ns3 ns4 ns5 ns9 ns10 and ns11 and 4 sites were chosen due to sensitive receptors ns2 ns6 ns7 and ns8 sampling period of each sites were also presented in fig 9 the optimal sampling time interval was set as τ min τ t i t i τ b t c τ f ou r i e r 30 2 mins and taken 30 min in practice 3 2 case ii emergency monitoring network design on real spill incidents after the nitrobenzene spill occurred at nov 24 2005 the provincial environmental protection agency epa immediately activated the emergency monitoring and started monitoring benzene and nitrobenzene concentrations based on the state routine monitoring stations fig 10 samples were taken at every two hours before the plume arrival and at every one hour during the plume passed through each cross section unep 2005 as a post audit the proposed monitoring network design approach can also be used to assess the rationality of the historical monitoring action in practice the rma2 and rma4 model package in surface water modelling system sms were used to model the travel of the contaminant plume in the river jiang et al 2012 the initial parameters of rma2 and rma4 models such as initial water surface elevation flow rate under steady flow and the initial nitrobenzene concentration were monitored by harbin epa the two model were both solved by the finite element method using the galerkin method of weighted residuals results showed that the mean value of relative error between the simulated and observed at songhuajiang village monitoring station is 0 3541 gao et al 2009 to be notice it is more a calibration rather than predication since only one group of observation data available to adjust dispersion coefficient decay coefficient etc as shown in fig 10 the spatial iti decreased from 1 to 0 53 downstream according to the 10 rule of iti decrease between two adjacent monitoring sites two new emergency monitoring sites were added besides the state routine monitoring stations fig 3 the interpolated monitoring site 1 was located between baiqi and hougang village and site 2 was located between hougang village and yushumiao referring to the terrestrial condition images in fig 3 and the location of sensitive receptors the two new monitoring sites were set at about 8 km and 49 km from baiqi site respectively for all the sites the titi defined sampling time interval τ i t i 240 mins the btc defined τ b t c 450 mins and spectral analysis defined τ f ourier 0 5 t π n ω 60 5 mins therefore the optimal sampling time interval τ was set as the minimum 60 5 min and in practice 60 min is adopted it was coincident with the historical sampling time interval used by the local provincial epa the quantitatively designed monitoring plan was illustrated by fig 3 3 3 comparison and discussion 3 3 1 comparison between the two cases in the both cases the monitoring networks were successfully designed comparison was made and listed at table 4 for the number of monitoring sites calculated by iti there are 7 sites at the length of 40 km for case i and 6 sites at the length of 80 km for case ii site density in case i is almost two times of that in case ii this difference can be explained by the characteristics of siti decay although case i is on the low flow condition the pollutant diffusion process is stronger than case ii accelerating the decay of siti the sampling time interval in case ii is 60 min which is two times of that in case i because study area in case i covers the release point such that the shape of btcs at downstream sites are narrower than that in case ii a more fundamental discussion is bellowing 3 3 2 theoretical analysis on entropy changes and uncertainty the proposed framework in this work is based on the entropy variation process controlled by advection diffusion reaction adr system information entropy changes in diffusion process was as early as discussed in 1983 by senf 1983 senf pointed out that the differential entropy with the same formula of discrete information entropy increased with time and could attain a maximum at equilibrium due to that the initial distribution of the diffusion is the least probable whilst equipartition status is the most probable an optimal moment exists in the measurement of time dependent information content processes kitanidis 1994 introduced the dilution index e to quantify dilution and reactive mixing in solute transport problems chiogna and rolle 2017 extended the dilution index e to the concept of critical reaction time considering mixing and reaction these studies provided foundation for theoretical analysis of information entropy changes for pollutant mixing transport in river it is consistent with the classical curve of entropy changes within physical processes that h increase initially from 0 then arrive at maximum entropy and finally descend to 0 fig 11 due to the long tail effects of adr process h curve also presents a long tail trends to zero the theoretical maximum entropy hmax lnn n is the number of subsets of a btc profile when the system arrived average distribution however due to the control of adr process lnn will never been arrived and the curves of h variation belong to a special functional like in chiogna and rolle 2017 we can herein define the site with largest entropy as critical site which can be adopted as an alternative to describe the characteristic length of spill incidents jiang et al 2017 the critical site can add in the monitoring network where monitoring equipment or online monitoring station expensive can be installed the change of controlling parameters of water quality model diffusion coefficient d x flow speed u degradation coefficient k and source term m directly lead to attenuation of entropy h and siti fig 11 presented how parameters of water quality model impact the h and siti evolution setting scenario with d0 u0 k0 and m0 as a baseline we next analyzed how h and siti curves change along with different water quality parameters when d x d0 i e the pollutant plume disperse faster the information entropy increase faster and the siti decrease faster when u u0 i e the pollutant plume transport faster and diffusion happen slower relatively the h curve moves forward compared with baseline scenario both conservative and non conservative pollutant share the same h curves but pollutant decay impacts siti curves since the total mass of pollutant is different namely the information decay for source term m it do not impact h curve like k does and it still keep the same curve of iti for different pollutant loading differing from k it is easy to understand the opposite situation when d x d0 u u0 k k0 those fundamental qualitative rules is not only important for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of network design but also linking with assumption on different scenarios i e various flow condition release pattern pollutant characteristics river morphology and so on comprehensive quantitative analysis will be reported in another paper 3 3 3 methodology comparison with other network design methods based on water quality model in this work entropy theory and water quality model are skillfully integrated serving to the emergency management of pollution risks on watershed under this circumstance the presented framework of monitoring network design herein focused on how to track the information of pollutant plumes transport rather than the routine observation on or representation of the environmental quality of the whole watershed karamouz et al 2009 chen et al 2012 puri et al 2017 the function of water quality modelling among those studies can be divided into two types 1 extension of monitoring data e g chen et al 2012 combined delfte3d with matter element analyses 2 utilizing model performance index as one objective for optimization e g puri et al 2017 combined sparrow and fluxmaster with genetic algorithm to remove unimportant stations for observing and assessing e coli loads in our work the function of water quality modelling can be defined as type 3 that producing potential monitoring data for monitoring network design aiming to routine observation where the issue is formulized as an optimization problem and entropy theory are usually combined with optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm and bayesian framework for example weighted spatial and temporal iti were linked with optimization objective strobl and robillard 2008 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 and violation entropy and total system entropy were adopted as the criteria in a multiple attribute decision making process alameddine et al 2013 in this work an empirical 10 rule was used for deduction on iti i e optimization it is a bit more subjective compared to abovementioned studies but it works it is meaningful in the future to enable watershed managers to prioritize specific objectives and constraints related to the cost of monitoring risk assessment and emergency treatment 3 3 4 method limitations some limitations of the proposed framework were then discussed since modelling performance significant impact the design process model calibration and verification is important in practice although it is costly for large rivers 2d model or 3d model may necessary containment transport in multimedia ambient water sediment and air were not considered in this study again design of temporal sampling in period of emergency response is a little tricky here 5 rules and 10 rules are subjective moreover the underlying drivers to the variation of fourier coefficients also need to be investigated theoretically in the further study 3 4 management implications the proposed approach specifically target at emergency management and the purpose of emergency monitoring stations here is significantly different from that of hydrological observation stations scientific observation or flood forecasting or normal monitoring stations administration it is also different from the purpose of monitoring stations designed for water quality early warning system environment institute s r o 2014 which focuses on abnormal detection of water quality variation and alarming shi et al 2017 this novel framework helps with collecting the essential data to scientific assessment of real time risks during incidents jiang et al 2012 this need cannot be meet by traditional emergency monitoring designing that the intuitively interpolation between routine water quality monitoring sites as a decision tool for disaster preparedness it is critical to assume all kinds of potential pollution scenarios and parameterization response and migration onto sudden pollution incidents are risk oriented watershed management while routine observation serving for normal management such as tdml thomann and mueller 1987 therefore the sensitive receptors like residential center and water intakes in the administrative area have to been considered in the proposed framework administrative regions were also considered as priority protected objects due to environmental forensic the starting time and sampling time interval of emergency monitoring are usually restricted to human resources and equipment available from the local government in addition the concentration of the leading edge and the surface water environmental standards should be both considered the former is in the scope of contaminant hydrology or water quality modelling while the latter is in the scope of environmental management if any of them to be exceeded monitoring activity should be started the proposed method is generic and applicable for watershed management in different countries around the world it is particularly useful for transboundary management such as danube river at europe pinter 1999 chapman et al 2016 tisza river basin at slovak republic environment institute s r o 2014 tanos et al 2015 elk river in west virginia usa cooper 2014 4 conclusions in this study a first framework was proposed to quantitatively design the emergency monitoring network for contaminant spill incidents in rivers that combing contaminant transport modelling with discrete entropy theory and spectral analysis contaminant transport model provides the potential information of spatiotemporal distribution of contaminant in rivers discrete spatial information transfer index for btcs i e potential pollution information defined the monitoring locations while temporal information transfer index at a given monitoring site defined the sampling frequency spectral analysis on btcs and shannon sampling theorem were used to further compact the sampling frequency the two case studies the dye tracing experiment in a small river and historical nitrobenzene spill in a big river explained and justified the applicability in practices the results indicate that the proposed approach can be used as an effective tool both for preparedness and in situ response water quality model can provide three functions for network design extension monitoring data production potential monitoring data and infusion model performance into an optimization objective preliminary theoretical analysis on entropy changes on the advection diffusion reaction system uncovered basic rules of iti evolving downstream the concept of critical site was proposed and defined where btc has the maximum entropy it is helpful for setting expensive online monitoring stations uncertainty on flow speed diffusion coefficient decay coefficient and source term in water quality model lead to various uncertainty of network design these parameters also classify the different spill incident scenario future works on emergency management practices e g human resource and training needs comprehensive

19699,quaternary ammonium compounds qacs are emerging contaminants with the extensive applications in a variety of fields however little is known about their potential impacts on activated sludge and performance of biological wastewater treatment processes in this work the effects of benzalkonium chloride bac a kind of qacs on acute and chronic responses of microorganisms and on mbr performance were systematically investigated the results showed that a low concentration 0 5 2 0 mg bac g ss caused no significant effects on activated sludge property in contrast an elevated concentration of bac led to severer inhibition on activated sludge and key enzyme activity e g dehydrogenase activity in both short term and long term exposure thus deteriorating the pollutant removal efficiency compared with the control mbr r1 and the reactor with 0 5 mg l bac r2 the removal efficiency of ammonia in r3 with 5 0 mg l bac at identical hydraulic retention time 4 3 h and sludge retention time 30 d was decreased i e ammonium removal efficiency in r1 r3 was 95 4 6 1 93 4 8 1 and 89 3 17 6 respectively moreover mbr tests showed that membrane fouling was aggravated in the presence of high concentration bac long term exposure to bac reduced microbial community diversity and enriched the bac resistant microbes for instance the abundance of pseudomonas genus in r3 was increased from 0 02 to 14 9 with the increase of operation time microbial community structure was changed to resist the environmental stress induced by bac during long term exposure thus decreasing the inhibition effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor microbial community pollutant removal quaternary ammonium compound membrane fouling wastewater treatment 1 introduction quaternary ammonium compounds qacs are a major class of cationic surfactants used as ingredients in fabric softeners disinfectants and numerous personal care products ding and tsai 2003 lara martín et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 according to available reports the 2004 world wide annual consumption of qacs was about 500 000 tons and was expected to rapidly increase in the future ismail et al 2010 li and brownawell 2010 due to substantial amounts of qacs used in domestic and industrial products qacs could be incidentally or intentionally released into environment which thus has been detected in surface waters kreuzinger et al 2007 olkowska et al 2013 wastewaters martínez carballo et al 2007 sewage sludges martinez carballo et al 2007 ruan et al 2014 soils and estuarine sediments li et al 2014 the presence of qacs may pose potential risks to living organisms in the environment calling for great efforts to investigate their possible adverse effects recent studies have shown that qacs can cause toxicity to model organisms perez et al 2017 for instance qacs exhibited acute toxicity to chlorella vulgais ec50 0 203 mg l zhu et al 2010 zebrafish liver cells ec50 0 85 mg l christen et al 2017 and aliivibrio fischeri ec50 1 0 mg l di nica et al 2017 these studies indicated that the toxicity of qacs was associated with the species of organisms wastewater treatment plants wwtps can be a major receiver of qacs since activated sludge in wwtps involves a complicated community of bacteria rikmann et al 2018 zekker et al 2012 2013 zheng et al 2011 it is difficult to clarify the potential responses of activated sludge based on current knowledge of the toxicity of qacs from studies of model aquatic organisms furthermore an important function of activated sludge from biological treatment processes is to remove organic matter and nutrient e g nitrogen from wastewater the presence of qacs may cause potential acute responses of activated sludge affecting sludge viability and thus contaminant removal whereas microorganisms subject to long term exposure of qacs might induce the changes in the diversity of microbial populations and bacterial community structure which play vital roles in system performance wagner et al 2002 wang et al 2008 wu et al 2013 however to date the acute and chronic effects of qacs on activated sludge viability and contaminant removal performance remain largely unknown the objective of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic responses of activated sludge to the presence of qacs the experiments were performed in a membrane bioreactor mbr due to its widespread applications for wastewater treatment and reclamation kim et al 2011 ma et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 key questions to be addressed in the present work include i what is the acute response of activated sludge in the presence of different qacs dosages ii what about the long term effects of qacs on the system performance and iii what is the prevailing mechanism dominating the acute and chronic responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade unless otherwise stated dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride bac was used as the model qac which was obtained from sigma aldrich chemical structure and additional information of bac are listed in si table s1 the bac stock suspensions were prepared by

triphosphate atp content dehydrogenase activity dha cell integrity and the organic removal efficiency were evaluated to indicate the acute responses of microorganisms 2 3 chronic exposure to bac three identical mbrs with an effective volume of 5 28 l were operated in parallel to evaluate the chronic effects of qac on mbr systems more information of mbr setup could be found in si section s2 and fig

were almost negligible however when the bac concentration was increased to 5 mg g ss obvious inhibition could be observed according to previous studies three processes involve in qac behaviors in activated sludge adsorption inhibition and biotransformation hajaya and pavlostathis 2013 and it has been reported that 95 of qacs are adsorbed to particulate matter topping and waters 1982 scott and jones 2000 tezel et al 2006 the presence of higher concentration of bac could lead to more amount of bac adsorbed to microorganisms thus inducing much severer inhibition efficiency on activated sludge viability cell integrity of activated sludge after exposure to different concentrations of bac were measured with the results presented in fig 1c broken cells were stained with propidium iodide pi while the intact cells were stained with syto 9 zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 1c when activated sludge was exposed to bac concentration at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 mg g ss the percentage of broken cells had no significant difference compared to the control p 0 05 indicating negligible influences of bac on cell membrane with the dosage less than 2 0 mg g ss however further increase of bac concentration led to a significant increase of the percentage of broken cells the percentage of broken cells was increased to 22 35 and 44 when the concentrations of bac were changed to 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg g ss respectively similar trends were observed for the biodegradation rate of organic substances naac as model organic substrate fig 1d for sludge samples after 2 h exposure to various bac concentration the increase of bac concentrations led to a rapid decrease in the degradation of organic matters in mbrs the deterioration in degradation of pollutants not only influences the effluent quality but also potentially increases membrane fouling rate due to the accumulation of organic matters in the system lee et al 2005 3 2 chronic effects of bac on mbr performance to elucidate the long term effects of bac on mbr performance three identical mbr systems i e r1 r2 and r3 were operated in parallel by dosing different bac concentration 0 mg g ss 0 5 mg g ss environmental relevant concentration and 5 0 mg g ss elevated concentration during the operation the average mlss concentrations in r1 r3 were maintained at 10 5 1 6 11 9 1 2 and 11 1 1 8 g l and temperature was in the range of 22 5 32 7 c due to the seasonal changes detailed operating conditions could be found in si fig s2 fig 2 a presents the evolution of tmp in three mbrs the tmp increase rate of r3 1 29 0 42 kpa d was much higher than that of r1 0 52 0 07 kpa d and r2 0 72 0 09 kpa d in long term operation suggesting that the adverse effects of qac on microorganisms aggravated membrane fouling this might be potentially attributed to the fact that microorganisms tend to secrete more microbial products bhaskar and bhosle 2005 kang et al 2014 thus increasing membrane fouling rate when subject to environmental stress the removal performance of cod and nh4 n in three mbrs are illustrated in fig 2b and c with removal efficiencies shown in si fig s3 during the 120 d operation the removal efficiencies of cod in the three reactors were almost the same 95 0 2 1 93 9 3 4 and 93 8 2 0 respectively although the presence of bac had no negative effects on organic removal in mbr systems p 0 05 the chronic exposure to 5 0 mg g ss r3 was found to induce the increase of effluent nh4 n concentration the ammonium removal efficiency in r1 r3 was 95 4 6 1 93 4 8 1 and 89 3 17 6 respectively si see fig s3 it was also found that the removal efficiency of nh4 n in r3 was significantly affected in the initial 11 days p 0 05 however it is interesting to note that the inhibition of bac on nh4 n removal was alleviated with the increase of operation time this result may indicate that long term exposure to bac may prompt microbial acclimation to bac mc cay et al 2010 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 moreover the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn in r3 41 8 7 23 was also lower than r1 45 5 8 8 and r2 44 0 6 54 in the long run detailed removal performance could be found in si table s2 microbial products secreted by microorganisms play an important role in membrane fouling cho and fane 2002 jeong et al 2017 and thus concentrations and compositions of smp and eps in the three mbr systems were measured see fig s4 it is evident that the presence of bac increased the quantity of microbial products in mbr systems for instance the total concentrations of smp in the three mbrs were 18 27 7 7 19 44 7 4 and 24 38 11 9 mg l respectively which increased with the increase of bac dosages similar trends can be observed for eps the increased production of microbial products can partially explain the aggravated membrane fouling in r2 and r3 jiang et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 to further elucidate the chronic effect of bac on membrane fouling behaviors clsm was conducted to visualize the fouled membranes at the end of operation as can be seen from fig 3 the foulant layer on r3 96 μm of thickness was thicker than those on r1 76 μm and r2 78 μm and r3 membrane had larger amounts of organic matters on its surface since the three mbrs were inoculated with the same sludge and operated under same conditions the differences of membrane foulant should be ascribed to the presence of bac the release of organic matters fig s4 induced by bac ioannou et al 2007 pérez et al 2009 may contribute to the accumulation of organic matters on membrane surface in r3 fig s5 the distribution of hydraulic resistances was also analyzed at the end of experiment table s3 it can be observed that the presence of bac in mbr systems changed the resistance distribution the external fouling gel layer resistance r c was increased in r3 90 50 compared to r1 and r2 it indicates that the presence of higher concentration of bac could increase the external fouling but slightly alleviate pore blocking due to the secondary membrane effect wang and wu 2009 for preventing fine particles entering the pores organic matter content in fouling layer further confirmed that the fouling layer of r3 had higher organic matters compared to r1 and r2 fig s5 which is consistent with the higher external fouling resistance in r3 3 3 chronic effects of bac on activated sludge property for further elucidating the negative effects of bac on activated sludge sour dha and atp of the activated sludge in the three mbrs were determined with the results presented in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4a the sour value of the mbr with a dosage of 0 5 mg g ss r2 had no significant difference compared with the control mbr r1 during the 120 d operation however the presence of 5 0 mg bac g ss induced a significant inhibition on sour from 5 d 62 59 to 41 d 80 58 which was then gradually recovered with the increase of operation time this result might indicate that the activity of activated sludge was initially inhibited in the presence of high concentration of bac followed by recovery due to the potential acclimation of microorganisms under long term exposure to bac dha activity and atp content were also measured periodically to further evaluate chronic effects of bac as can be seen from fig 4b and c the variation of both dha and atp content followed a similar changing pattern to that of sour the presence of 5 0 mg bac g ss significantly down regulated the activity of dha and atp content at the first stage again confirming that a sudden exposure to higher bac concentration affected aerobic respiratory behaviors and the tca cycle with the increase of operation time the activity of dha and atp content were also gradually recovered 3 4 chronic effects of bac on microbial community structure the microbial community compositions and structure of activated sludge in mbr systems is critical for biological pollutant removal which might be varied in mbrs in the presence of bac to reveal the changes in microbial community among the three mbrs illumina miseq was employed to analyze the inoculated sludge sample inoculum and the samples from each mbr systems at 36 d r1 36 r2 36 r3 36 and 78d r1 78 r2 78 r3 78 respectively following overlapping and quality control 259 891 sequence amplicons in the v3v4 region were obtained with an average length of 438 17 bp the observed number of operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 distance were 941 inoculum 1222 r1 36 1239 r2 36 and 1144 r3 36 respectively table s4 it should be noted that sampling coverage for all samples is above 0 99 indicating that illumina miseq sequencing is capable of detecting most of the reads in this study lemos et al 2011 the rarefaction curves were generated for all samples at a distance of 3 see fig s6a rarefaction curves showed that r1 and r2 had the steepest rarefaction curves with the highest taxon richness while the samples of r3 had the lowest on either 36 d or 78 d rarefaction curves of the shannon index can also reflect the richness and evenness of microbial community wang et al 2012 as can be seen from fig s6b rarefaction curves of all samples approached the plateau at about 3000 reads the rarefaction curves showed that r1 had the highest diversity e g 5 89 on 36 d and 5 74 on 78 d while r3 had the lowest e g 5 47 on 36 d and 4 93 on 78 d this result indicates that the presence of bac in mbr systems can lower the diversity of microbial community principal component analysis pca based on otu level was conducted to reveal the distances and variations among all the samples luo et al 2017 with results illustrated in si fig s6c it is evident that samples of r1 36 r2 36 r1 78 and r2 78 were close to the sample inoculum whereas the samples from the mbr system dosed with 5 0 mg bac g ss r3 36 and r3 78 clearly clustered together the above results indicated that the microbial diversity was decreased and microbial structure changed as a result of the long term exposure to high concentration of bac illumina miseq results indicate that bacterial community was mainly composed of 17 phyla except unclassified bacteria in the samples as can be seen from fig 5 a proteobacteria bacteroidetes antinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in these samples with minor phyla accounting for a small fraction the main differences and changes among these samples were associated with the distribution of phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and antinobacteria the presence of a higher concentration of bac in r3 shifted the relative abundance of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and antinobacteria e g r3 36 to 58 20 12 57 and 4 73 compared to that in r1 36 45 35 15 40 and 11 65 respectively moreover the increased relative abundance of proteobacteria phylum in r3 might be attributed to the fact that the long term exposure of bac enriched potential bac resistant microbes i e pseudomonas belonging to γ proteobacteria tandukar et al 2013 to further clarify the changes of microbial structures hierarchical clustered heatmap analysis was conducted to illustrate the differences of bacterial structures of r1 36 r2 36 r3 36 r1 78 r2 78 and r3 78 at genus level jiang et al 2016 ma et al 2013 as can be seen from fig 5b four clusters were identified from the six microbial communities by hierarchical cluster analysis cluster i r1 36 r2 36 cluster ii r3 36 cluster iii r1 78 r2 78 cluster iv r3 78 the microbial community structures in both cluster i r1 36 r2 36 and cluster iii r1 78 r2 78 exhibited high homology indicating that low concentration of bac environmental relevant concentration might not significantly change the community structures however both r3 36 cluster ii and r3 78 cluster iv were separated from cluster i r1 36 r2 36 and cluster iii r1 78 r2 78 further demonstrating that the long term exposure to high bac concentration changed the microbial community structure moreover it is interesting to note that the relative abundance of pseudomonas which has been reported as bac resistant genus tandukar et al 2013 increased as a function of operation time in r3 for instance the abundance of pseudomonas in r3 78 was 14 9 much higher than 0 02 in inoculum and 0 47 in r3 36 according to previous literature pseudomonas is also well known for forming biofilms stover et al 2000 which might also partially account for the higher membrane fouling rate in r3 3 5 mechanisms involved in the acute and chronic responses based on above analyses a mechanistic role of bac in the acute and chronic responses of activated sludge in mbrs was proposed fig 6 short term exposure of microorganisms to qacs could induce the damage of cell membrane ferreira et al 2011 nakata et al 2011 and inhibition of the activity of key enzymes e g dha and respiratory enzyme thus affecting the tca cycle qacs can interact with bacteria by penetrating their alkyl chain into microorganism s membrane and altering the phospholipid bilayer pérez et al 2009 sütterlin et al 2008 in this study the percentage of broken cells was observed to increase with the increase of bac fig 1c similar trends were observed for the activity of dha and the contents of atp demonstrating an acute negative influences on microorganisms for long term exposure microbial viability as indicated by sour dha and atp fig 2 in r3 system was gradually recovered with the increase of operation time this might be associated with the enrichment of bac resistant microorganisms and even bac degradable microorganisms hughes and andersson 2012 moen et al 2012 however batch tests in this study showed that the microorganisms after acclimation did not exhibit enhanced degradation of bac fig s7 suggesting that the gradual recovery of microbial viability was mainly associated with the enrichment of bac resistant microbes rather than bac degradable microorganisms the enrichment of the bac resistant microbes e g pseudomonas which is known for forming biofilms stover et al 2000 would also lead to severer membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors furthermore it is known that microorganisms might secrete more microbial products under the environmental stress induced by bac to protect themselves bhaskar and bhosle 2005 han et al 2017 kang et al 2014 which may also contribute to increased membrane fouling rate in membrane bioreactor 4 conclusions the present study showed that a low concentration 0 5 2 0 mg bac g ss caused no significant effects on activated sludge property p 0 05 while an elevated concentration of bac led to severer inhibition on activated sludge the short term exposure of activated sludge to higher concentration bac induced significant adverse effects on sludge viability however long term exposure to qac could acclimate microorganisms and increase their resistance to qacs resulting in changes in microbial community structure and decrease of the microbial community diversity and richness membrane fouling was also aggravated in the presence of high concentration bac the enrichment of the bac resistant genus mainly pseudomonas was also observed which contributed to the alleviation of inhibition effects but might partially account for higher membrane fouling rate in membrane bioreactor acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge the fundamental research funds

19699,quaternary ammonium compounds qacs are emerging contaminants with the extensive applications in a variety of fields however little is known about their potential impacts on activated sludge and performance of biological wastewater treatment processes in this work the effects of benzalkonium chloride bac a kind of qacs on acute and chronic responses of microorganisms and on mbr performance were systematically investigated the results showed that a low concentration 0 5 2 0 mg bac g ss caused no significant effects on activated sludge property in contrast an elevated concentration of bac led to severer inhibition on activated sludge and key enzyme activity e g dehydrogenase activity in both short term and long term exposure thus deteriorating the pollutant removal efficiency compared with the control mbr r1 and the reactor with 0 5 mg l bac r2 the removal efficiency of ammonia in r3 with 5 0 mg l bac at identical hydraulic retention time 4 3 h and sludge retention time 30 d was decreased i e ammonium removal efficiency in r1 r3 was 95 4 6 1 93 4 8 1 and 89 3 17 6 respectively moreover mbr tests showed that membrane fouling was aggravated in the presence of high concentration bac long term exposure to bac reduced microbial community diversity and enriched the bac resistant microbes for instance the abundance of pseudomonas genus in r3 was increased from 0 02 to 14 9 with the increase of operation time microbial community structure was changed to resist the environmental stress induced by bac during long term exposure thus decreasing the inhibition effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor microbial community pollutant removal quaternary ammonium compound membrane fouling wastewater treatment 1 introduction quaternary ammonium compounds qacs are a major class of cationic surfactants used as ingredients in fabric softeners disinfectants and numerous personal care products ding and tsai 2003 lara martín et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 according to available reports the 2004 world wide annual consumption of qacs was about 500 000 tons and was expected to rapidly increase in the future ismail et al 2010 li and brownawell 2010 due to substantial amounts of qacs used in domestic and industrial products qacs could be incidentally or intentionally released into environment which thus has been detected in surface waters kreuzinger et al 2007 olkowska et al 2013 wastewaters martínez carballo et al 2007 sewage sludges martinez carballo et al 2007 ruan et al 2014 soils and estuarine sediments li et al 2014 the presence of qacs may pose potential risks to living organisms in the environment calling for great efforts to investigate their possible adverse effects recent studies have shown that qacs can cause toxicity to model organisms perez et al 2017 for instance qacs exhibited acute toxicity to chlorella vulgais ec50 0 203 mg l zhu et al 2010 zebrafish liver cells ec50 0 85 mg l christen et al 2017 and aliivibrio fischeri ec50 1 0 mg l di nica et al 2017 these studies indicated that the toxicity of qacs was associated with the species of organisms wastewater treatment plants wwtps can be a major receiver of qacs since activated sludge in wwtps involves a complicated community of bacteria rikmann et al 2018 zekker et al 2012 2013 zheng et al 2011 it is difficult to clarify the potential responses of activated sludge based on current knowledge of the toxicity of qacs from studies of model aquatic organisms furthermore an important function of activated sludge from biological treatment processes is to remove organic matter and nutrient e g nitrogen from wastewater the presence of qacs may cause potential acute responses of activated sludge affecting sludge viability and thus contaminant removal whereas microorganisms subject to long term exposure of qacs might induce the changes in the diversity of microbial populations and bacterial community structure which play vital roles in system performance wagner et al 2002 wang et al 2008 wu et al 2013 however to date the acute and chronic effects of qacs on activated sludge viability and contaminant removal performance remain largely unknown the objective of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic responses of activated sludge to the presence of qacs the experiments were performed in a membrane bioreactor mbr due to its widespread applications for wastewater treatment and reclamation kim et al 2011 ma et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 key questions to be addressed in the present work include i what is the acute response of activated sludge in the presence of different qacs dosages ii what about the long term effects of qacs on the system performance and iii what is the prevailing mechanism dominating the acute and chronic responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade unless otherwise stated dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride bac was used as the model qac which was obtained from sigma aldrich chemical structure and additional information of bac are listed in si table s1 the bac stock suspensions were prepared by adding the predetermined bac to 50 ml of deionized di water 2 2 acute exposure to bac sludge samples were collected from an mbr system see detailed information about this mbr in supporting information

predetermined bac concentrations 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 10 0 20 mg bac g ss an exposure duration of 2 h was used to simulate a shock load of bac after exposure to different concentrations of bac adenosine triphosphate atp content dehydrogenase activity dha cell integrity and the organic removal efficiency were evaluated to indicate the acute responses of microorganisms 2 3 chronic exposure to bac three identical mbrs with an effective volume of 5 28 l were operated in parallel to evaluate the chronic effects of qac on mbr systems more information of mbr setup could be found in si section s2 and fig

analytical methods 2 4 1 assessment of potential influence on mbr performance microbial products including soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted from sludge by ultrasonication centrifugation method han et al 2013 and measured according to literature chen et al 2017 han et al 2015 at the end of operation 120 d membrane fouling in the three mbrs was evaluated several pieces of membrane coupons were cut from the membrane for confocal laser scanning microscope clsm nikon a1 tokyo japan observation the biofilm on membrane surface was stained with concavalin a con a molecular probes inc and sypro orange molecular probes u s to label α polysaccharides and proteins respectively chen et al 2006 yeon et al 2009 the fouling layers were mildly scraped off from membrane surfaces with a certain surface area of 60 cm2 the samples collected were diluted with di to 50 ml and well mixed by placing on a magnetic stirrer proteins humic acids and carbohydrates in the sample were quantitatively determined the filtration resistances of mbrs were calculated according to the following equation wang et al 2014 1 r t r c r p r m where r t is the

al 2016 2017 were measured to evaluate the acute effects induced by bac as shown in fig 1 a and b when the bac concentration was blow 2 0 mg g ss the inhibition of bac on dha activity and atp content were almost negligible however when the bac concentration was increased to 5 mg g ss obvious inhibition could be observed according to previous studies three processes involve in qac behaviors in

viability cell integrity of activated sludge after exposure to different concentrations of bac were measured with the results presented in fig 1c broken cells were stained with propidium iodide pi

no significant difference compared to the control p 0 05 indicating negligible influences of bac on cell membrane with the dosage less than 2 0 mg g ss however further increase of bac concentration led to a significant increase of the percentage of broken cells the percentage of broken cells was increased to 22 35 and 44 when the concentrations of bac were changed to 5 0 10 0 and 20 0 mg g ss respectively similar trends were observed for the biodegradation rate of organic substances naac as model organic substrate fig 1d for sludge samples after 2 h exposure to various bac concentration the increase of bac concentrations led to a rapid decrease in the degradation of organic matters in mbrs the deterioration in degradation of pollutants not only influences the effluent quality but also potentially increases membrane fouling rate due to the accumulation of organic matters in the system lee et al 2005 3 2 chronic effects of bac on mbr performance to elucidate the long term effects of bac on mbr performance three identical mbr systems i e r1 r2 and r3 were operated in parallel by dosing different bac concentration 0 mg g ss 0 5 mg g ss environmental relevant concentration and 5 0 mg g ss elevated concentration during the operation the average mlss concentrations in r1 r3 were maintained at 10 5 1 6 11 9 1 2 and 11 1 1 8 g l and temperature was in the range of 22 5 32 7 c due to the seasonal changes detailed operating conditions could be found in si fig s2 fig 2 a presents the evolution of tmp in three mbrs the tmp increase rate of r3 1 29 0 42 kpa

microbial products secreted by microorganisms play an important role in membrane fouling cho and fane 2002 jeong et al 2017 and thus concentrations and compositions of smp and eps in the three mbr

bac on microbial community structure the microbial community compositions and structure of activated sludge in mbr systems is critical for biological pollutant removal which might be varied in mbrs in the presence of bac to reveal the changes in microbial community among the three mbrs illumina miseq was employed to analyze the inoculated sludge sample inoculum and the samples from each mbr systems at 36 d r1 36 r2 36 r3 36 and 78d r1 78 r2 78 r3 78 respectively following overlapping and quality control 259 891 sequence amplicons in the v3v4 region were obtained with an average length of 438 17 bp the observed number of operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 distance were 941 inoculum 1222 r1 36 1239 r2 36 and 1144 r3 36 respectively table s4 it should be noted that sampling coverage for all samples is above 0 99 indicating that illumina miseq sequencing is capable of detecting most of the reads in this study lemos et al 2011 the rarefaction curves were generated for all samples at a distance of 3 see fig s6a rarefaction curves showed that r1 and r2 had the steepest rarefaction curves with the highest taxon richness while the samples of r3 had the lowest on either 36 d or 78 d rarefaction curves of the shannon index can also reflect the richness and evenness of microbial community wang et al 2012 as can be seen from fig s6b rarefaction curves of all samples approached the plateau at about 3000 reads the rarefaction curves showed that r1 had the highest diversity e g 5 89 on 36 d and 5 74 on 78 d while r3 had the lowest e g 5 47 on 36 d and 4 93 on 78 d this result indicates that the presence of bac in mbr systems can lower the diversity of microbial community principal component analysis pca based on otu level was conducted to reveal the distances and variations among all the samples luo et al 2017 with results illustrated in si fig s6c it is evident that samples of r1 36 r2 36 r1 78 and r2 78 were close to the sample inoculum whereas the samples from the mbr system dosed with 5 0 mg bac g ss r3 36 and r3 78 clearly clustered together the above results indicated that the microbial diversity was decreased and microbial structure changed as a result of the long term exposure to high concentration of bac illumina miseq results indicate that bacterial community was mainly composed of 17 phyla except unclassified bacteria in the samples as can be seen from fig 5 a proteobacteria bacteroidetes antinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in these samples with minor phyla accounting for a small fraction the main differences and changes among these samples were associated with the distribution of phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and antinobacteria the presence of a higher concentration of bac in r3 shifted the relative abundance of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and antinobacteria e g r3 36 to 58 20 12 57 and 4 73 compared to that in r1 36 45 35 15 40 and 11 65 respectively moreover the increased relative abundance of proteobacteria phylum in r3 might be attributed to the fact that the long term exposure of bac enriched potential bac resistant microbes i e pseudomonas belonging to γ proteobacteria tandukar et al 2013 to further clarify the changes of microbial structures hierarchical clustered heatmap analysis was conducted to illustrate the differences of bacterial structures of r1 36 r2 36 r3 36 r1 78 r2 78 and r3 78 at genus level jiang et al 2016 ma et al 2013 as can be seen from fig 5b four clusters were identified from the six microbial communities by hierarchical cluster analysis cluster i r1 36 r2 36 cluster ii r3 36 cluster iii r1 78 r2 78 cluster iv r3 78 the microbial community structures in both cluster i r1 36 r2 36 and cluster iii r1 78 r2 78 exhibited high homology indicating that low concentration of bac environmental relevant concentration might not significantly change the community structures however both r3 36 cluster ii and r3 78 cluster iv were separated from cluster i r1 36 r2 36 and cluster iii r1 78 r2 78 further demonstrating that the long term exposure to high bac concentration changed the microbial community structure moreover it is interesting to note that the relative abundance of pseudomonas which has been reported as bac resistant genus tandukar et al 2013 increased as a function of operation time in r3 for instance the abundance of pseudomonas in r3 78 was 14 9 much higher than 0 02 in inoculum and 0 47 in r3 36 according to previous literature pseudomonas is also well known for forming biofilms stover et al 2000 which might also partially account for the higher membrane fouling rate in r3 3 5 mechanisms involved in the acute and chronic responses based on above analyses a mechanistic role of bac in the acute and chronic responses of activated sludge in mbrs was proposed fig 6 short term exposure of microorganisms to qacs could induce the damage of cell membrane ferreira et al 2011 nakata et al 2011 and inhibition of the activity of key enzymes e g dha and respiratory enzyme thus affecting the tca cycle qacs can interact with bacteria by penetrating their alkyl chain into microorganism s membrane and altering the phospholipid bilayer pérez et al 2009 sütterlin et al 2008 in this study the percentage of broken cells was observed to increase with the increase of bac fig 1c similar trends were observed for the activity of dha and the contents of atp demonstrating an acute negative influences on microorganisms for long term exposure microbial viability as indicated by sour dha and atp fig 2 in r3 system was gradually recovered with the increase of operation time this might be associated with the enrichment of bac resistant microorganisms and even bac degradable microorganisms hughes and andersson 2012 moen et al 2012 however batch tests in this study showed that the microorganisms after acclimation did not exhibit enhanced degradation of bac fig s7 suggesting that the gradual recovery of microbial viability was mainly associated with the enrichment of bac resistant microbes rather than bac degradable microorganisms the enrichment of the bac resistant microbes e g pseudomonas which is known for forming biofilms stover et al 2000 would also lead to severer membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors furthermore it is known that microorganisms might secrete more microbial products under the environmental stress induced by bac to protect themselves bhaskar and bhosle 2005 han et al 2017 kang et al 2014 which may also contribute to increased membrane fouling rate in membrane bioreactor 4 conclusions the present study showed that a low concentration 0 5 2 0 mg bac g ss caused no significant effects on activated sludge property p 0 05 while an elevated concentration of bac led to severer inhibition on activated sludge the short term exposure of activated sludge to higher concentration bac induced significant adverse effects on sludge viability however long term exposure to qac could acclimate microorganisms and increase their resistance to qacs resulting in changes in microbial community structure and decrease of the microbial community diversity and richness membrane fouling was also aggravated in the presence of high concentration bac the enrichment of the bac resistant genus mainly pseudomonas was also observed which contributed to the alleviation of inhibition effects but might partially account for higher membrane fouling rate in membrane bioreactor acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge the fundamental research funds
