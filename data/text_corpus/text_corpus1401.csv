7005,the solution for the inverse problem of seawater intrusion at an aquifer scale has not been studied as extensively as forward modeling because of the conceptual and computational difficulties involved a three dimensional variable density conceptual phreatic model is developed by constraining with real field data such as layering aquifer bottom topography and appropriate initial conditions the initial aquifer parameters are layered heterogeneous and spatially homogeneous that are based on discrete field measurements the developed conceptual model shows poor correlation with observed state variables hydraulic head and solute concentration signifying the importance of spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of all the layers the conceptual model is inverted to estimate the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and the longitudinal dispersivity at the pilot points by minimizing the least square error of state variables across the observation wells the inverse calibrated model is validated for the hydraulic head at validation wells and the solute concentration is validated with equivalent solute concentration derived from the electrical resistivity which shows good results against the field measurements the verification of estimated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity with the electrical resistivity tomography image shows good agreement this investigation gives an insight about constraining the highly parameterized inverse model with real field data to estimate spatially varying aquifer parameters for an effective simulation of the seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer keywords seawater intrusion parameter estimation dispersivity hydraulic conductivity pilot point 1 introduction aquifer characterization is one of the important input in groundwater simulation models the information about the aquifer characteristics is usually determined by conducting field experiments such as pumping test electrical resistivity borehole logging etc but conducting field experiments to determine the aquifer parameters for the entire study area is not feasible an inverse approach is a standard tool used for the parameter estimation in the subsurface hydrology there are mainly two methods to estimate parameters i e deterministic approach and geostatistical approach in a deterministic approach the geological information in terms of spatial variability zonation can be incorporated in the model the main disadvantage of the deterministic models is its inability to estimate the uncertainty but are reliable for predicting swi and have much greater robustness for incorporating the concentrations data for estimating the aquifer parameters pool et al 2015 the geostatistical approach considers the parameters such as random field and assumes that the spatial variability is unknown the stochastic approaches can address uncertainties well and can give better results but the stochastic models perform poorly and underestimates uncertainty when the data given is scanty pool et al 2015 hence in the present investigation a deterministic inverse approach is used in the past an inverse approach was extensively used to estimate the groundwater flow parameters e g emsellem and de marsily 1971 frind and pinder 1973 cooley 1977 kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 carrera 1988 mclaughlin and townley 1996 franssen and gómez hernández 2002 franssen et al 2009 pool et al 2015 while the inverse approach to estimate identify the solute transport parameters received little attention e g murty and scott 1977 umari et al 1979 giacobbo et al 2002 bray et al 2007 from the late 1980 s considerable research has been carried out to estimate both flow and solute transport parameters strecker and chu 1986 and keidser and rosbjerg 1991 estimated the groundwater flow and transport parameters separately in two stages but these approaches cannot be used to solve the coupled inverse problem considerable research has been carried out to estimate both groundwater flow and transport parameters simultaneously e g wagner and gorelick 1986 wagner 1992 xiang et al 1992 medina and carrera 1996 mayer and huang 1999 sun et al 2001 franssen et al 2003 sanz and voss 2006 bastani et al 2010 most of the proposed methods were applied to hypothetical synthetic aquifers and limited work has been carried out on three dimensional 3d variable density inverse modeling at an aquifer scale e g medina and carrera 1996 mayer and huang 1999 bastani et al 2010 dausman et al 2010 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 the real field coupled inverse problem may be ill posed if they are solved considering the state variables only and without any information on the parameters to be estimated the use of prior information in the optimization process will improve the identification of heterogeneity alcolea et al 2006 remove the non uniqueness and provide stability to the solutions the parameter estimation for the 3d real field problems such as seawater intrusion swi in a coastal aquifer is a complex and dynamic problem in the past modelers have estimated the flow and solute transport parameters for the swi problems iribar et al 1997 estimated the transmissivity values by considering the piezometric head and the chloride concentration in a confined aquifer of llobregat delta for the same aquifer abarca et al 2006 estimated zonal aquifer heterogeneity for a 2d horizontal groundwater flow and solute transport model in both the studies the density effects were neglected since the aquifer thickness and the elevation gradients were small the density effect was studied by sanz and voss 2006 to estimate the flow and transport parameters but on a standard henry problem bray et al 2007 estimated the flow and solute transport parameters in a 3d variable density conceptual model but in two independent and successive phases this method is not a coupled flow and solute transport inversion the inverse modeling of a 3d variable density groundwater flow and solute transport system was carried out by dausman et al 2010 they addressed the computational complexities involved in the inverse modeling but the plume migration pathways were based on multiple hypotheses beaujean et al 2014 used the solute concentration values as a state variable which were derived from the electrical resistivity tomography to estimate parameters in a 2d model a number of studies have been carried out on the inverse modeling in a 3d coastal aquifer considering the density effect and field measurements e g bastani et al 2010 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lathashri and mahesha 2015 but the aquifer parameters estimated were either isotropic or homogeneous the literature survey confirms that not many studies have been carried out to the estimate anisotropic spatially varying aquifer parameters in a 3d conceptual model because of the significant computational resources and the time required the computational and conceptual difficulties in the parameter estimation for a 3d variable density coupled groundwater flow and solute transport in the coastal aquifers were reviewed by carrera et al 2010 they have reviewed in detail on these computational and conceptual issues ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 have discussed the computational problems involved in solving the simulation optimization framework and how to resolve them rajabi and ketabchi 2017 have addressed the computational challenge in solving a simulation optimization framework by employing gaussian process emulation in kish island persian gulf the present study focuses on considering the conceptual issues such as layering aquifer bottom topography and appropriate initial field conditions to estimate the parameters in a coastal aquifer the objectives of the paper are 1 estimating anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity 2 developing a reliable validation method to evaluate numerical model results with electrical resistivity tomography ert 3 verifying the estimated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity with ert images the analysis gives an insight into the layering anisotropic and heterogeneity constraint to simulate the groundwater flow and swi phenomenon at an aquifer scale and a comprehension about the geological formation of the region thus this investigation will be useful for the analysis of swi inversion problem at an aquifer scale 2 description of study area the study area falls under the surathkal and mukka region of dakshina kannada district karnataka located along the west coast of india fig 1 a the aerial extent is about 8 km2 and the area is surrounded by the arabian sea on the west and the seasonal tidal river pavanje in the north and north eastern part fig 1b the area is characterized by relatively undulating terrain with altitudes ranging up to 37 m above mean sea level msl the coastal and the pavanje river length in the study area are around 3 1 km and 5 5 km respectively the terrain is relatively flat near the coast causing swi into the river for several kilometers thus contaminating the adjacent freshwater aquifer since pavanje is a non perennial river the water required for the agriculture and domestic use is mainly met by groundwater during the non monsoon period this region falls under a tropical humid climate with an annual average rainfall of about 3797 mm and approximately 87 of which is experienced from june september there are 14 observation wells considered in the area which are well spread with one observation well for 1 km2 except for the south western part which is barren the water level and quality in these wells were monitored once in a month over a period of three years from 2005 to 2008 vyshali 2008 the ird institut de recherche pour le développement france and nitk national institute of technology karnataka surathkal conducted 2d electrical resistivity test borehole logging fig 1c and pumping tests to delineate the geological formation and to characterize the aquifer in this region the electrical resistivity test was carried out using wenner alpha and beta arrays together with an inter electrode spacing of 4 m and data inversion was performed using res2dinv software geotomo software the robust inversion method adopted gave good results with an absolute error of 5 hoareau 2009 hoareau 2009 combined interpretation of inverted electrical resistivity measurements and information derived from the borehole logging such as magnetic susceptibility groundwater resistivity rock apparent resistivity etc to establish a relationship between the ranges of electrical resistivity tomography ert and geological formations table 1 the vertical electrical soundings ves carried out by mahesha et al 2012 near the observation wells gives information on the geological formation table 1 and the layer thickness based on the available borehole logging details fig 2 ert and ves results it can be inferred that the soil composition of the aquifer layers is as follows layers 1 and 2 i e ground level gl to 20 m thick layer of coastal alluvium consists of clayey soil clayey sand fine silt and lateritic clay the top surface of the soil is hard and red in color the porosity of these layers varies between 0 25 and 0 6 udayakumar 2008 the hydraulic conductivity for the clay and silt formation varies between 0 35 and 10 m d freeze and cherry 1979 and for the lateritic clay it is between 10 and 30 m d bhosale and kumar 2001 layers 3 and 4 i e gl to 30 m thick layer of the weathered zone and weathered zone with clay formation this layer is formed due to weathering of crystalline or sedimentary rocks the porosity and hydraulic conductivity vary between 0 2 and 0 3 and 25 70 m d bhosale and kumar 2001 respectively a layer of fissured zones with sequences of highly fissured bedrock can be seen in between the layers of the coastal alluvium and the weathered zone fig 2 the porosity and hydraulic conductivity vary between 0 05 and 0 3 and 5 30 m d freeze and cherry 1979 respectively layer 5 deeper down the fresh bedrock with relatively less fissures is present 3 model development and inputs 3

treat the nonlinearities and the matrices are solved by the conjugate gradient methods the second order accurate explicit adams bashforth predictor and trapezoidal rule corrector method ab tr is used for time stepping for further details on feflow the reader can refer to diersch 2014 3 1 1 aquifer topography and discretization a 3d unconfined conceptual model is developed with its origin at 4 76 559 78 m easting and 14 37 602 16 m northing as per world geodetic system wgs 84 universal transverse mercator utm zone 43n in the horizontal plane the vertical section of the 3d model is represented by 5 layers fig 3 a and the thickness of each layer is shown in fig 3b the axis normal to the sea is x an axis parallel to the sea is y and along the depth the axis is z the polygonal area is proposed with a total number of 249 140 elements i e 49 828 elements in each layer and 159 492 nodes the proposed mesh is refined at the analysis wells and along the boundary of the region fig 3c the shuttle radar topography mission srtm of 1 arc second data is interpolated to get the top elevation at the nodal points the surface elevation varies between 0 and 37 m above msl and the bottom topography of the aquifer varies from 42 m below msl to about 6 m above msl based on the depth of the observation wells borehole logging and ves data the thickness of each layer is assigned and interpolated for the entire model 3 2 description of the inverse code the output error criterion is used for the parameter estimation here the difference between the observed and simulated state variables at the observation points are minimized the nonlinear pest model independent parameter estimation developed by john doherty 1994 is used as an inverse code pest runs the feflow iteratively by adjusting the values of parameters to be estimated until the errors between the observed and simulated state variables reach the terminating criterion the gauss levenberg marquardt algorithm glma is used for minimizing the objective function eq 3 3 minimize φ o w hi i 1 m t 1 n h t i h t i 2 w ci i 1 m t 1 n c t i c t i 2 3a constraint p j l p j p j u where i 1 2 m number of observation wells t observed

w is the associated weight p is the parameter to be estimated l and u are lower and upper bounds of the parameters respectively which are obtained from the geological information table 1 and j is a node the observation weights are computed from the reciprocal of the standard deviation σ of measurements the weights for the hydraulic head varies between 0 67 and 1 25 and for solute concentration weight varies between 0 01 and 0 1 the higher weight of 1 is assigned for the solute concentration data of the wells 7 and 11 since these wells are used for the model evaluation tikhonov regularization and singular value decomposition are used to prevent numerical instability and non uniqueness while estimating a large number of parameters for further details on mathematical regularization in pest the reader can refer to doherty 2004 anyone of the following criterion can be used to terminate the iterative process if φ i 0 25 where φ i the objective function value at the

1 the coastline r 1 is defined as a dirichlet boundary condition as shown in fig 3c the hydraulic head is prescribed as an equivalent freshwater head over full thickness i e 41 m motz and sedighi 2009 the solute concentration of the seawater is normally estimated based on the total dissolved solids tds e g cobaner et al 2012 sherif et al 2012 ding et al 2014 therefore the solute concentration of seawater along the coastal line is given a tds value of 35 kg m3 the river boundary r 3 is defined as a cauchy boundary condition which accounts for the flow between the river pavanje and groundwater system the data of the river stage hydraulic conductivity of the river bed material k and thickness of the river bed d are required to prescribe this boundary condition the monthly river stage is obtained from the minor irrigation department and the water resources information system of india the hydraulic conductivity of pavanje river bed is 7 85 m d sujay and deka 2016 and the thickness of the river bed is assumed as 0 8 m which are fixed for the entire length of the river the solute concentration referred to as tds in the study of the river varies due to the mixing of freshwater and seawater the solute concentration in the river is considered only till second vented dam fig 1b which is 3 32 km along river length from the coastal line beyond this point c 0 mg l for region r 2 as there is no natural boundary condition specified head from hydraulic head contour and specified concentration from solute concentration contour are used the top boundary condition is defined as a specified flux recharge rate which is phreatic in nature the bottom boundary is considered as a no flow boundary condition the initial hydraulic head for the domain is assigned for the starting month i e for february 2005 at discrete observation points and kriging e g yao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 is used to get the continuous hydraulic head the initial solute concentration mass concentration is assigned with steady state simulation output integrated with the observation data points 3 3 2 source and sinks the main source and sink for groundwater in the study area are recharge and groundwater draft respectively during the monsoon period june september the aquifer is replenished to the saturation level the rainfall is the main source for aquifer recharge but during the non monsoon period the pavanje river contributes the recharge is computed by multiplying the recharge coefficient with monthly rainfall data imd 2004 2010 data udayakumar 2008 estimated the appropriate recharge coefficient values which is in the range of 8 26 5 but according to the groundwater estimation committee gec 1997 for the west coast of india recharge coefficient can be considered in the range of 8 12 therefore in the present investigation the recharge coefficient is considered to be 10 as the study area is small a uniform recharge rate is assumed throughout the layer 1 there are 374 pumping wells in the region which contributes as the main sink lathashri and mahesha 2015 the freshwater draft data for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon from these 374 wells are taken from lathashri and mahesha 2015 the subsurface discharge to the sea and the river are the other sinks which are considered in boundary conditions 3 3 3 initial aquifer parameters the aquifer parameters i e transmissivity and specific yield estimated by mahesha et al 2012 using the pumping test at discrete points are interpolated using kriging in the present study to get the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield for the first layer as shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the arithmetic mean μ and standard deviation σ of the spatially varying hydraulic conductivities are 11 882 m d and 4 84 m d respectively and for the specific yield μ 0 086 and σ 0 065 since most of the wells are shallow 3 to 11 m the pumping test is restricted to the top layer of the developed conceptual model based on the pumping test results mahesha et al 2012 the hydraulic conductivity value of layer 1 is found to be spatially varying fig 4a and transversely isotropic i e kxx kyy kzz the hydraulic conductivity of the remaining layers is considered as layered heterogeneous based on the soil type table 1 based on the earlier investigations in the study area such as borehole logging ves and pumping test udayakumar 2008 hoareau 2009 mahesha et al 2012 and other studies freeze and cherry 1979 gec 1997 lathashri and mahesha 2015 layer wise input values for flow and solute transport parameters are as in table 2 the vertical hydraulic conductivity value is assumed to be 10 of horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the x major axis from layer 3 onwards there are no field measurements of dispersivity values of the study area the longitudinal dispersivity αl values are determined by using the regression formula derived previously to relate the field scale length and dispersivity in the present investigation a statistical model using the available data with varying reliabilities derived by xu and eckstein 1995 is used to estimate the αl values the equation is given by 9 α l 0 83 log 10 l 2 414 where l field scale m αl longitudinal dispersivity m low reliable data weight 1 intermediate reliable data weight 2 and high reliable data weight 3 and eq 9 is valid for field scale up to 1 km but for the conceptual model developed eq 9 is assumed to be valid beyond 1 km the transverse dispersity αt is considered to be 1 10th of longitudinal dispersivity e g cobaner et al 2012 lathashri and mahesha 2015 the spatial distribution αl is same in all the layers fig 5 the other parameters considered are uniform for all the layers table 3 the fluid density at the observation wells ρ is computed by 10 ρ m c ρ c c m ρ f where m number of observation wells c solute concentration kg m3 and ρf freshwater density kg m3 3 3 4 state variables the monthly water table level w r t msl and tds data for the study area are obtained from 14 observation wells the hydraulic head for the wells is calculated with respect to the datum and corresponding elevation above msl the wells 1 4 6 7 8 11 and 12 which are located 500 m from the water bodies show solute concentration values 0 25 kg m3 but in well 2 which is located 250 m from the water body fig 1b the temporal concentration values 100 mg l this indicates that the solute concentration data in the locality is not consistent this is because of other sources contaminating the well water the depth at which the water is sampled for tds analysis is not available according to the world health organization who the acceptable tds value for drinking water is below 0 5 kg m3 therefore tds values 0 5 kg m3 are only considered 3 4 application of inverse modeling the first step is to identify whether the given hydro geological parameters of the developed conceptual model are accurate or not this can be done by the model evaluation discussed in section 3 4 1 with respect to the observed state variables as discussed in the previous section the tds values 0 5 kg m3 500 mg l are not considered for the study therefore the model performance for solute concentration is evaluated for the wells 7 and 11 only for a period of 3 years the next step is to identify the important parameters for understanding the dynamics between groundwater flow and swi based on model evaluation and literature the significant parameters are estimated using the inverse model without changing the other model inputs for minimizing the solute concentration term c in eq 3 tds values for all the 14 observation wells over 3 years are considered the aquifer parameters to be estimated are parameterized with pilot points parameter adjustable computational points the pilot points are randomly spaced with an equal number of points in each layer and the spacing between these points are based on monte carlo sampling with 5 iterations fig 6 the parameters estimated at the pilot points are interpolated using kriging to get the continuous function of the spatial variability the measure of location and variability of the estimated heterogeneous aquifer parameter values in each layer is characterized by μ σ geometric mean gm median maximum and minimum parameter value skewness a measure of symmetry and kurtosis a measure of peakedness box and whisker figure is plotted to graphically represent μ σ geometric mean gm median maximum and minimum parameter value the histogram is an effective graphical representation to indicate the skewness and kurtosis of the data set for further details on skewness and kurtosis the readers can refer to das 2009 the inverse calibrated model is validated over a period of two years with the water level data measured twice in a month at four validation wells honnanagoudar 2014 these validation wells are different from the observation wells considered for the parameter estimation since the adequate solute concentration data is not available at the validation wells the validation is only for the hydraulic head the electrical resistivity measurements carried out by ird and nitk during january february 2008 are used to validate the simulated tds values the inverted ert results provide continuous subsurface characterization and are used for validation the numerical model results on solute concentration are validated with equivalent solute concentration derived from inverted ert hoareau 2009 the following eq 11 given by comte and banton 2007 provide the relation between pore water conductivity in µs cm and solute

mahesha 2015 from the forward modeling results and the earlier studies e g sanz and voss 2006 abarca et al 2007 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity are the two significant parameters to assess swi therefore inverse modeling is used to estimate major axes anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneous longitudinal dispersivity in this study hydraulic conductivity in the z direction is not as important as kxx kyy and αl because the geological formation below layer 2 is mostly laterite with without the presence of clay or fissured zone in such a case the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivity in a layer will be small thus kzz is not evaluated 4 results and discussion 4 1 developed conceptual model the developed conceptual model is simulated for 3 years number of temporal observation 37 with a stress period of 1 day the mean rmse h temporal temporal rmse of the hydraulic head and mean temporal b h b of the hydraulic head of 14 observation wells over 3 years are 2 56 m and 2 182 m respectively indicating that the simulated values are less than the observed the mean temporal r h 2 r2 of the hydraulic head value over 14 observation wells is 0 505 0 6 which indicates poor fit between the observed and simulated hydraulic heads fig 7 illustrates the rmse h spatial spatial rmse for the hydraulic head for 37 temporal observations over 14 observation wells and the value ranges between 3 55 m may 2005 and 5 5 m july 2007 the rmse h spatial 4 96 m for the monsoon period and rmse h spatial 4 21 m for the non monsoon period high rmse h spatial and low r h 2 indicates that the misfit between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads are high and poorly correlated even though layer 1 of the conceptual model is considered spatially varying fig 4 the performance of the model is poor this suggests that the hydraulic head is dependent on the heterogeneity of the other layers the storage term does not influence the hydraulic head significantly over a simulation time of one day thus it can be concluded that the hydraulic conductivity is a deterministic parameter in the modeling of the hydraulic head the rmse c temporal temporal rmse of the solute concentration at wells 7 and 11 are 0 42 kg m3 and 0 721 kg m3 respectively and temporal b c b of the solute concentration at wells 7 and 11 are 0 368 kg m3 and 0 717 kg m3 respectively the temporal r c 2 r2 of the solute concentration at well 7 and 11 are 0 193 and 0 482 respectively which indicates poor fit between the observed and simulated solute concentrations thus it can be concluded that the errors in the solute concentration values are mainly due to the homogeneous solute transport parameters according to the literature dispersivity is one of the important parameters in assessing swi sanz and voss 2006 abarca et al 2007 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 from the model evaluation and the literature it can be concluded that the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity are the two deterministic parameters in the modeling of the swi 4 2 inverse modeling the optimal fit between the simulated and observed state variables are estimated by finding a set of anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity values a total of 1134 data points are used for the inverse modeling i e 44 temporal observed values on the hydraulic head and 37 temporal observed values on the tds at each observation well there are 75 pilot points in a 5 layered model and three parameters i e kxx kyy and αl are estimated at each pilot point a single iteration of the optimization requires approximately 160 h to estimate 225 values kxx kyy and αl on the 64 bit pathway a 3 07 ghz processor and 12 0 gb of ram from the 4th iteration only kxx and kyy parameters are considered since the relative change in αl values are 0 1 and time taken is reduced to approximately 71 h on the same configuration machine hence approximately 1620 h are required for the inverse model to terminate and the termination criterion is φ i φ min φ i 0 1 the estimated parameters from the inverse model are discussed in the following sections 4 2 1 hydraulic conductivity the statistics of the estimated hydraulic conductivities in x and y major axes are summarized in fig 8 a and b respectively the layerwise spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity in x and y major axes are shown in the figs 9 and 10 respectively along with the histograms from fig 8a it is observed that the overall hydraulic conductivity values along the x major axis range from 0 374 to 63 221 m d from fig 9 it can be noticed that the kxx values along the coastal length near the sea are 3 5 m d in layers 2 and 5 indicating the existence of a less permeable geological formation based on table 1 the following interpretations of the soil composition have been made layer 1 has 30 94 of coastal alluvium 47 91 of lateritic clay and 21 15 of laterite soil layer 2 has 60 75 of clayey sand or fine silt 9 87 of laterite soil and 29 38 of fissured rock lateritic clay layer 3 has 52 08 of clay and silt formation 10 48 of weathered zone and 37 44 of fissured rock lateritic clay layer 4 has 46 of clay and silt formation 50 81 of fissured bedrock and remaining of weathered bedrock layer 5 has 35 58 of clay silt zone 20 4 of weathered bedrock and 44 02 of the fissured rock from fig 10 the kyy values range from 0 53 to 30 m d which is not similar to that of kxx range because of the upper limit pj u in eq 3a for kyy was assigned a value of 30 m d this difference is due to groundwater flow to the sea along the x direction from the histograms of kyy and table 1 the soil type parallel to the coast can be interpreted as in layer 1 65 83 of elements are laterite soil out of which 47 9 for elements have the kyy value 30 m d 28 16 of lateritic clay and remaining is covered with coastal alluvium layer 2 is a homogeneous layer since 98 62 is clay silt formation layer 3 has 89 3 of clay and silt formation and remaining is fissured bedrock lateritic clay layer 4 has 67 51 of clay and remaining is fissured bedrock layer 5 fissured bedrock covers 68 38 29 76 of clay silt zone and remaining with a small amount of weathered bedrock from this it can be concluded that the layers parallel to the coast have no or thin layer of weathered bedrock also evident from fig 2 4 2 2 dispersivity the spatial distribution and statistics of the estimated αl at layer 1 are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively fig 11c is the histogram of the estimated αl from fig 11a it is observed that the αl values vary between 6 265 and 11 901 m at the wells 1 2 6 and 8 the αl 7 5 m at the wells 7 9 and 10 the αl ranges between 7 5 and 9 m and at remaining wells the αl 9 m the spatial distribution of αl in other layers are same as shown in the fig 11a the fig 11d shows the comparison between αl values estimated from the xu eckstein formula and the inverse model the wells 5 and 14 are not considered because l 1 km from the source and the rate of increase of dispersivity beyond 1 km can be neglected xu and eckstein 1995 at the well 4 the αl value from the inverse model exactly coincides with the αl value derived by the regression formula at wells 6 8 9 12 and 13 the αl values of the inverse model and from the regression equation are approximately the same 4 2 3 inverse calibrated model performance the temporal performance of the inverse calibrated model over time is evaluated by using r h 2 b h and rmse h table 4 the negative sign of b indicates that the inverse calibrated model underestimates the state variables and vice versa from table 4 it is observed that the mean temporal r h 2 r2 of the hydraulic head of the inverse calibrated model for the 14 observation wells over 3 years has improved by 1 64 times than the developed conceptual model which indicates better and improved fit between the observed and the simulated hydraulic heads the mean temporal b h b of the hydraulic head and mean rmse h temporal temporal rmse of the hydraulic head of the inverse calibrated model for the 14 observation wells over 3 years decreased by 75 7 and 50 8 respectively from the developed conceptual model fig 12 illustrates the monthly rmse h spatial spatial rmse for the hydraulic head over 14 observation wells the rmse h spatial has reduced by 64 for both the monsoon and non monsoon period when compared with the developed conceptual model from table 4 it can be observed that the temporal rc 2 improves in well 11 from 0 482 to 0 551 but the fit between the observed and simulated concentrations at well 7 is still poor this discrepancy may be because of the influence of the contaminated river on the adjacent observation well 7 the rmse c temporal at wells 7 and 11 reduced by 5 7 and 8 87 respectively and temporal b c at wells 7 and 11 reduced by 9 5 the reduction in errors of solute concentration is not 10 indicating the additional data requirement for the calibration 4 3 validation and verification 4 3 1 validation of the inverse calibrated model for the hydraulic head the model efficiency of the inverse calibrated model at each validation well is tabulated table 5 since there are only 4 wells the performance of the inverse calibrated model is validated only at well points and not spatially the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated hydraulic heads are 0 6 which indicates a good fit fig 13 compares the hydraulic head between the observed and simulated values the validation wells v3 and v4 which are located near the river fig 1b show good correlation which indicates that the given boundary condition for the river is accurate from fig 13 it can be noticed that at wells v1 and v2 there is a sudden increase in the observed hydraulic head of 3 m at the beginning of the monsoon which indicates that the requirement of the field investigation to understand this sudden change in the hydraulic head 4 3 2 validation of the inverse calibrated model for the solute concentration fig 14 a shows ert at profile l1 refer fig 1b these resistivity values are converted into equivalent tds values fig 14b using eq 11 and fig 14c represents the results of solute transport by the inverse calibrated model the results of the numerical model fig 14c are validated with the equivalent tds values fig 14b it can be observed that in fig 14b and c at 5 m below msl the tds values are 1500 mg l indicating the maximum intrusion at the same depth the resistivity values of the saturated clay and silt formation vary between 30 and 80 ω m refer to table 1 it is known that archie s law is not valid in the presence of clay formation thus the clay formation cannot be considered as swi at 170 270 m fig 14b to quantify the error in the simulated tds values the electrical resistivity data points are matched with the simulated tds data points based on the euclidean distance the data points with a euclidean distance 1 m are not considered for the model evaluation fig 15 a from the fig 15a the bias error between the equivalent and simulated tds values mostly lie between 0 2 and 0 2 kg m3 fig 15b illustrates the goodness of fit between the equivalent and simulated tds values the rmse and b are 0 213 kg m3 and 0 078 kg m3 respectively implying the confidence in the inverse calibrated model results the validation method adapted here is novel and is used to quantify the error between the measured and simulated results 4 3 3 verification of layering and geological formation the estimated hydraulic conductivity in x and y directions are verified for layering and geological formation table 1 i e by comparing the vertical 2d profile from the inverse calibrated model with ert image fig 16 for this verification the profiles t1 and l2 are considered such that they are located 1 km from the coastal line fig 1b and these profiles are not subjected to swi in the profile t1 fig 16a it is noticed that an average of 9 m thick saturated clayey formation is in between 1 m and 8 m and from the inverse calibrated model output 7 m thick saturated clayey formation on an average is found in between 2 m and 6 m in the profile l2 fig 16b it is seen that the inverse calibrated model can reproduce the clayey formation between 470 and 540 m distance the homogeneous pattern of the weathered zone can be noticed in the 2d sections of ert image and the inverse calibrated model result fig 16b from this observation it can be concluded that the interpolated layer thickness and the estimated geological formation is similar to the field measurements the parameter estimation approach at pilot points by using highly parameterized inverse model offers guidance on estimating anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity in real field layered unconfined aquifer involving swi the use of real field data such as appropriate initial aquifer parameters and constraining the inverse model with the upper and lower bounds of the parameters reduces the number of iterations required to minimize the objective function improve the potential estimates and possible convergence the inverted electrical resistivity output used for validation significantly supports the methodology adopted for the inverse modeling 5 summary and conclusions in this study a 3d variable density unconfined coastal aquifer model is developed by constraining the model with aquifer topography and appropriate initial field conditions from the forward modeling results it is observed that the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity are the deterministic parameters to assess the swi in a coastal aquifer the inverse code pest is used to minimize the least square error for the state variables and to estimate these deterministic parameters a reliable validation method is adopted to evaluate the inverse calibrated model results with the ert profile the aquifer layering and the estimated geological formation are verified by comparing with ert images the study explains the necessity of considering layering and anisotropic heterogeneous aquifer parameters for effective simulation of swi the analysis gives knowledge about the geological formation in the study area the present study infers the following points the low performance of the developed conceptual model signifies the importance of considering spatially varying aquifer flow and solute transport parameters in all the layers the high error in the hydraulic head indicates that the hydraulic conductivity is one of the deterministic parameters since storage term does not influence the hydraulic head significantly over a simulation time of one day the inverse model used to estimate anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivities and heterogeneous longitudinal dispersivity is computationally demanding but this effort is worthwhile to obtain the spatially varying aquifer parameters the inverse calibrated model results show substantial improvement error in the hydraulic head is reduced by 50 when compared with the developed conceptual model the error in the solute concentration is reduced by 10 which suggests additional data requirement though the least square error of the state variables is minimized at the observation wells the validation of the inverse calibrated model shows good results at the validation wells which significantly support the performance of the inverse calibrated model the tds values determined by the inverse calibrated model is evaluated with equivalent tds values computed from the electrical resistivities the inverse calibrated model results show better agreement with the field data and a novel validation method adapted is more reliable than the commonly used comparison validation the comparison verification of layering shows good agreement with the electrical resistivities layers the verification also shows that the inverse calibrated model is able to reproduce the field data the knowledge of geological formation normal and parallel to the coast has improved based on the estimated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity which can be used for the planning strategies and management of the aquifer system acknowledgments the authors thank johan hoareau jean michel vouillamoz

7005,the solution for the inverse problem of seawater intrusion at an aquifer scale has not been studied as extensively as forward modeling because of the conceptual and computational difficulties involved a three dimensional variable density conceptual phreatic model is developed by constraining with real field data such as layering aquifer bottom topography and appropriate initial conditions the initial aquifer parameters are layered heterogeneous and spatially homogeneous that are based on discrete field measurements the developed conceptual model shows poor correlation with observed state variables hydraulic head and solute concentration signifying the importance of spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity of all the layers the conceptual model is inverted to estimate the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and the longitudinal dispersivity at the pilot points by minimizing the least square error of state variables across the observation wells the inverse calibrated model is validated for the hydraulic head at validation wells and the solute concentration is validated with equivalent solute concentration derived from the electrical resistivity which shows good results against the field measurements the verification of estimated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity with the electrical resistivity tomography image shows good agreement this investigation gives an insight about constraining the highly parameterized inverse model with real field data to estimate spatially varying aquifer parameters for an effective simulation of the seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer keywords seawater intrusion parameter estimation dispersivity hydraulic conductivity pilot point 1 introduction aquifer characterization is one of the important input in groundwater simulation models the information about the aquifer characteristics is usually determined by conducting field experiments such as pumping test electrical resistivity borehole logging etc but conducting field experiments to determine the aquifer parameters for the entire study area is not feasible an inverse approach is a standard tool used for the parameter estimation in the subsurface hydrology there are mainly two methods to estimate parameters i e deterministic approach and geostatistical approach in a deterministic approach the geological information in terms of spatial variability zonation can be incorporated in the model the main disadvantage of the deterministic models is its inability to estimate the uncertainty but are reliable for predicting swi and have much greater robustness for incorporating the concentrations data for estimating the aquifer parameters pool et al 2015 the geostatistical approach considers the parameters such as random field and assumes that the spatial variability is unknown the stochastic approaches can address uncertainties well and can give better results but the stochastic models perform poorly and underestimates uncertainty when the data given is scanty pool et al 2015 hence in the present investigation a deterministic inverse approach is used in the past an inverse approach was extensively used to estimate the groundwater flow parameters e g emsellem and de marsily 1971 frind and pinder 1973 cooley 1977 kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 carrera 1988 mclaughlin and townley 1996 franssen and gómez hernández 2002 franssen et al 2009 pool et al 2015 while the inverse approach to estimate identify the solute transport parameters received little attention e g murty and scott 1977 umari et al 1979 giacobbo et al 2002 bray et al 2007 from the late 1980 s considerable research has been carried out to estimate both flow and solute transport parameters strecker and chu 1986 and keidser and rosbjerg 1991 estimated the groundwater flow and transport parameters separately in two stages but these approaches cannot be used to solve the coupled inverse problem considerable research has been carried out to estimate both groundwater flow and transport parameters simultaneously e g wagner and gorelick 1986 wagner 1992 xiang et al 1992 medina and carrera 1996 mayer and huang 1999 sun et al 2001 franssen et al 2003 sanz and voss 2006 bastani et al 2010 most of the proposed methods were applied to hypothetical synthetic aquifers and limited work has been carried out on three dimensional 3d variable density inverse modeling at an aquifer scale e g medina and carrera 1996 mayer and huang 1999 bastani et al 2010 dausman et al 2010 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 the real field coupled inverse problem may be ill posed if they are solved considering the state variables only and without any information on the parameters to be estimated the use of prior information in the optimization process will improve the identification of heterogeneity alcolea et al 2006 remove the non uniqueness and provide stability to the solutions the parameter estimation for the 3d real field problems such as seawater intrusion swi in a coastal aquifer is a complex and dynamic problem in the past modelers have estimated the flow and solute transport parameters for the swi problems iribar et al 1997 estimated the transmissivity values by considering the piezometric head and the chloride concentration in a confined aquifer of llobregat delta for the same aquifer abarca et al 2006 estimated zonal aquifer heterogeneity for a 2d horizontal groundwater flow and solute transport model in both the studies the density effects were neglected since the aquifer thickness and the elevation gradients were small the density effect was studied by sanz and voss 2006 to estimate the flow and transport parameters but on a standard henry problem bray et al 2007 estimated the flow and solute transport parameters in a 3d variable density conceptual model but in two independent and successive phases this method is not a coupled flow and solute transport inversion the inverse modeling of a 3d variable density groundwater flow and solute transport system was carried out by dausman et al 2010 they addressed the computational complexities involved in the inverse modeling but the plume migration pathways were based on multiple hypotheses beaujean et al 2014 used the solute concentration values as a state variable which were derived from the electrical resistivity tomography to estimate parameters in a 2d model a number of studies have been carried out on the inverse modeling in a 3d coastal aquifer considering the density effect and field measurements e g bastani et al 2010 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lathashri and mahesha 2015 but the aquifer parameters estimated were either isotropic or homogeneous the literature survey confirms that not many studies have been carried out to the estimate anisotropic spatially varying aquifer parameters in a 3d conceptual model because of the significant computational resources and the time required the computational and conceptual difficulties in the parameter estimation for a 3d variable density coupled groundwater flow and solute transport in the coastal aquifers were reviewed by carrera et al 2010 they have reviewed in detail on these computational and conceptual issues ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 have discussed the computational problems involved in solving the simulation optimization framework and how to resolve them rajabi and ketabchi 2017 have addressed the computational challenge in solving a simulation optimization framework by employing gaussian process emulation in kish island persian gulf the present study focuses on considering the conceptual issues such as layering aquifer bottom topography and appropriate initial field conditions to estimate the parameters in a coastal aquifer the objectives of the paper are 1 estimating anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity 2 developing a reliable validation method to evaluate numerical model results with electrical resistivity tomography ert 3 verifying the estimated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity with ert images the analysis gives an insight into the layering anisotropic and heterogeneity constraint to simulate the groundwater flow and swi phenomenon at an aquifer scale and a comprehension about the geological formation of the region thus this investigation will be useful for the analysis of swi inversion problem at an aquifer scale 2 description of study area the study area falls under the surathkal and mukka region of dakshina kannada district karnataka located along the west coast of india fig 1 a the aerial extent is about 8 km2 and the area is surrounded by the arabian sea on the west and the seasonal tidal river pavanje in the north and north eastern part fig 1b the area is characterized by relatively undulating terrain with altitudes ranging up to 37 m above mean sea level msl the coastal and the pavanje river length in the study area are around 3 1 km and 5 5 km respectively the terrain is relatively flat near the coast causing swi into the river for several kilometers thus contaminating the adjacent freshwater aquifer since pavanje is a non perennial river the water required for the agriculture and domestic use is mainly met by groundwater during the non monsoon period this region falls under a tropical humid climate with an annual average rainfall of about 3797 mm and approximately 87 of which is experienced from june september there are 14 observation wells considered in the area which are well spread with one observation well for 1 km2 except for the south western part which is barren the water level and quality in these wells were monitored once in a month over a period of three years from 2005 to 2008 vyshali 2008 the ird institut de recherche pour le développement france and nitk national institute of technology karnataka surathkal conducted 2d electrical resistivity test borehole logging fig 1c and pumping tests to delineate the geological formation and to characterize the aquifer in this region the electrical resistivity test was carried out using wenner alpha and beta arrays together with an inter electrode spacing of 4 m and data inversion was performed using res2dinv software geotomo software the robust inversion method adopted gave good results with an absolute error of 5 hoareau 2009 hoareau 2009 combined interpretation of inverted electrical resistivity measurements and information derived from the borehole logging such as magnetic susceptibility groundwater resistivity rock apparent resistivity etc to establish a relationship between the ranges of electrical resistivity tomography ert and geological formations table 1 the vertical electrical soundings ves carried out by mahesha et al 2012 near the observation wells gives information on the geological formation table 1 and the layer thickness based on the available borehole logging details fig 2 ert and ves results it can be inferred that the soil composition of the aquifer layers is as follows layers 1 and 2 i e ground level gl to 20 m thick layer of coastal alluvium consists of clayey soil clayey sand fine silt and lateritic clay the top surface of the soil is hard and red in color the porosity of these layers varies between 0 25 and 0 6 udayakumar 2008 the hydraulic conductivity for the clay and silt formation varies between 0 35 and 10 m d freeze and cherry 1979 and for the lateritic clay it is between 10 and 30 m d bhosale and kumar 2001 layers 3 and 4 i e gl to 30 m thick layer of the weathered zone and weathered zone with clay formation this layer is formed due to weathering of crystalline or sedimentary rocks the porosity and hydraulic conductivity vary between 0 2 and 0 3 and 25 70 m d bhosale and kumar 2001 respectively a layer of fissured zones with sequences of highly fissured bedrock can be seen in between the layers of the coastal alluvium and the weathered zone fig 2 the porosity and hydraulic conductivity vary between 0 05 and 0 3 and 5 30 m d freeze and cherry 1979 respectively layer 5 deeper down the fresh bedrock with relatively less fissures is present 3 model development and inputs 3

by 5 layers fig 3 a and the thickness of each layer is shown in fig 3b the axis normal to the sea is x an axis parallel to the sea is y and along the depth the axis is z the polygonal area is proposed with a total number of 249 140 elements i e 49 828 elements in each layer and 159 492 nodes the proposed mesh is refined at the analysis wells and along the boundary of the region fig 3c the shuttle radar topography mission srtm of 1 arc second data is interpolated to get the top elevation at the nodal points the surface elevation varies between 0 and 37 m above msl and the bottom topography of the aquifer varies from 42 m below msl to about 6 m above msl based on the depth of the observation wells borehole logging and ves data the thickness of each layer is assigned and interpolated for the entire model 3 2 description of the inverse code the output error criterion is used for the parameter estimation here the difference between the observed and simulated state variables at the observation points are minimized the nonlinear pest model independent parameter estimation developed by john doherty 1994 is used as an inverse code pest runs the feflow iteratively by adjusting the values of parameters to be estimated until the errors between the observed and simulated state variables reach the terminating criterion the gauss levenberg marquardt algorithm glma is used for

w is the associated weight p is the parameter to be estimated l and u are lower and upper bounds of the parameters respectively which are obtained from the geological information table 1 and j is a node the observation weights are computed from the reciprocal of the standard deviation σ of measurements the weights for the hydraulic head varies between 0 67 and 1 25 and for solute concentration weight varies between 0 01 and 0 1 the higher weight of 1 is assigned for the solute concentration data of the wells 7 and 11 since these wells are used for the model evaluation tikhonov regularization and singular value decomposition are used to prevent numerical instability and non uniqueness while estimating a large number of parameters for further details on mathematical regularization in pest the reader can refer to doherty 2004 anyone of the following criterion can be used to terminate the iterative process if φ i 0 25 where φ i the objective function value at the

the solute concentration of the seawater is normally estimated based on the total dissolved solids tds e g cobaner et al 2012 sherif et al 2012 ding et al 2014 therefore the solute concentration of seawater along the coastal line is given a tds value of 35 kg m3 the river boundary r 3 is defined as a cauchy boundary condition which accounts for the flow between the river pavanje and groundwater system the data of the river stage hydraulic conductivity of the river bed material k and thickness of the river bed d are required to prescribe this boundary condition the monthly river stage is obtained from the minor irrigation department and the water resources information system of india the hydraulic conductivity of pavanje river bed is 7 85 m d sujay and deka 2016 and the thickness of the river bed is assumed as 0 8 m which are fixed for the entire length of the river the solute concentration referred to as tds in the study of the river varies due to the mixing of freshwater and seawater the solute concentration in the river is considered only till second vented dam fig 1b which is 3 32 km along river length from the coastal line beyond this point c 0 mg l for region r 2 as there is no natural boundary condition specified head from hydraulic head contour and specified concentration from solute concentration contour are used the top boundary condition is defined as a specified flux recharge rate which is phreatic in nature the bottom boundary is considered as a no flow boundary condition the initial hydraulic head for the domain is assigned for the starting month i e for february 2005 at discrete observation points and kriging e g yao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 is used to get the continuous hydraulic head the initial solute concentration mass concentration is assigned with steady state simulation output integrated with the observation data points 3 3 2 source and sinks the main source and sink for groundwater in the study area are recharge and groundwater draft respectively during the monsoon period june september the aquifer is replenished to the saturation level the rainfall is the main source for aquifer recharge but during the non monsoon period the pavanje river contributes the recharge is computed by multiplying the recharge coefficient with monthly rainfall data imd 2004 2010 data udayakumar 2008 estimated the appropriate recharge coefficient values which is in the range of 8 26 5 but according to the groundwater estimation committee gec 1997 for the west coast of india recharge coefficient can be considered in the range of 8 12 therefore in the present investigation the recharge coefficient is considered to be 10 as the study area is small a uniform recharge rate is assumed throughout the layer 1 there are 374 pumping wells in the region which contributes as the main sink lathashri and mahesha 2015 the freshwater draft data for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon from these 374 wells are taken from lathashri and mahesha 2015 the subsurface discharge to the sea and the river are the other sinks which are considered in boundary conditions 3 3 3 initial aquifer parameters the aquifer parameters i e transmissivity and specific yield estimated by mahesha et al 2012 using the pumping test at discrete points are interpolated using kriging in the present study to get the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield for the first layer as shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the arithmetic mean μ and standard deviation σ of the spatially varying hydraulic conductivities are 11 882 m d and 4 84 m d respectively and for the specific yield μ 0 086 and σ 0 065 since most of the wells are shallow 3 to 11 m the pumping test is restricted to the top layer of the developed conceptual model based on the pumping test results mahesha et al 2012 the hydraulic conductivity value of layer 1 is found to be spatially varying fig 4a and transversely isotropic i e kxx kyy kzz the hydraulic conductivity of the remaining layers is considered as layered heterogeneous based on the soil type table 1 based on the earlier investigations in the study area such as borehole logging ves and pumping test udayakumar 2008 hoareau 2009 mahesha et al 2012 and other studies freeze and cherry 1979 gec 1997 lathashri and mahesha 2015 layer wise input values for flow and solute transport parameters are as in table 2 the vertical hydraulic conductivity value is assumed to be 10 of horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the x major axis from layer 3 onwards there are no field measurements of dispersivity values of the study area the longitudinal dispersivity αl values are determined by using the regression formula derived previously to relate the field scale length and dispersivity in the present investigation a statistical model using the available data with varying reliabilities derived by xu and eckstein 1995 is used to estimate the αl values the equation is given by 9 α l 0 83 log 10 l 2 414 where l field scale m αl longitudinal dispersivity m low reliable data weight 1 intermediate reliable data weight 2 and high reliable data weight 3 and eq 9 is valid for field scale up to 1 km but for the conceptual model developed eq 9 is assumed to be valid beyond 1 km the transverse dispersity αt is considered to be 1 10th of longitudinal dispersivity e g cobaner et al 2012 lathashri and mahesha 2015 the spatial distribution αl is same in all the layers fig 5 the other parameters considered are uniform for all the layers table 3 the fluid density at the observation wells ρ is computed by 10 ρ

study area are obtained from 14 observation wells the hydraulic head for the wells is calculated with respect to the datum and corresponding elevation above msl the wells 1 4 6 7 8 11 and 12 which are located 500 m from the water bodies show solute concentration values 0 25 kg m3 but in well 2 which is located 250 m from the water body fig 1b the temporal concentration values 100 mg l this indicates that the solute concentration data in the locality is not consistent this is because of other sources contaminating the well water the depth at which the water is sampled for tds analysis is not available according to the world health organization who the acceptable tds value for drinking water is below 0 5 kg m3 therefore tds values 0 5 kg m3 are only considered 3 4 application of inverse modeling the first step is to identify whether the given hydro geological parameters of the developed conceptual model are accurate or not this can be done by the model evaluation discussed in section 3 4 1 with respect to the observed state variables as discussed in the previous section the tds values 0 5 kg m3 500 mg l are not considered for the study therefore the model performance for solute concentration is evaluated for the wells 7 and 11 only for a period of 3 years the next step is to identify the important parameters for understanding the dynamics between groundwater flow and swi based on model evaluation and literature the significant parameters are estimated using the inverse model without changing the other model inputs for minimizing the solute concentration term c in eq 3 tds values for all the 14 observation wells over 3 years are considered the aquifer parameters to be estimated are parameterized with pilot points parameter adjustable computational points the pilot points are randomly spaced with an equal number of points in each layer and the spacing between these points are based on monte carlo sampling with 5 iterations fig 6 the parameters estimated at the pilot points are interpolated using kriging to get the continuous function of the spatial variability the measure of location and variability of the estimated heterogeneous aquifer parameter values in each layer is characterized by μ σ geometric mean gm median maximum and minimum parameter value skewness a measure of symmetry and kurtosis a measure of peakedness box and whisker figure is plotted to graphically represent μ σ geometric mean gm median maximum and minimum parameter value the histogram is an effective graphical representation to indicate the skewness and kurtosis of the data set for further details on skewness and kurtosis the readers can refer to das 2009 the inverse calibrated model is validated over a period of two years with the water level data measured twice in a month at four validation wells honnanagoudar 2014 these validation wells are different from the observation wells considered for the parameter estimation since the adequate solute concentration data is not available at the validation wells the validation is only for the hydraulic head the electrical resistivity measurements carried out by ird and nitk during january february 2008 are used to validate the simulated tds values the inverted ert results provide continuous subsurface characterization and are used for validation the numerical model results on solute concentration are validated with equivalent solute concentration derived from inverted ert hoareau 2009 the following eq 11 given by comte and banton 2007 provide the relation between pore water conductivity in µs cm and solute

mahesha 2015 from the forward modeling results and the earlier studies e g sanz and voss 2006 abarca et al 2007 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity are the two significant parameters to assess swi therefore inverse modeling is used to estimate major axes anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneous longitudinal dispersivity in this study hydraulic conductivity in the z direction is not as important as kxx kyy and αl because the geological formation below layer 2 is mostly laterite with without the presence of clay or fissured zone in such a case the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivity in a layer will be small thus kzz is not evaluated 4 results and discussion 4 1 developed conceptual model the developed conceptual model is simulated for 3 years number of temporal observation 37 with a stress period of 1 day the mean rmse h temporal temporal rmse of the hydraulic head and mean temporal b h b of the hydraulic head of 14 observation wells over 3 years are 2 56 m and 2 182 m respectively indicating that the simulated values are less than the observed the mean temporal r h 2 r2 of the hydraulic head value over 14 observation wells is 0 505 0 6 which indicates poor fit between the observed and simulated hydraulic heads fig 7 illustrates the rmse h spatial spatial rmse for the hydraulic head for 37 temporal observations over 14 observation wells and the value ranges between 3 55 m may 2005 and 5 5 m july 2007 the rmse h spatial 4 96 m for the monsoon period and rmse h spatial 4 21 m for the non monsoon period high rmse h spatial and low r h 2 indicates that the misfit between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads are high and poorly correlated even though layer 1 of the conceptual model is considered spatially varying fig 4 the performance of the model is poor this suggests that the hydraulic head is dependent on the heterogeneity of the other layers the storage term does not influence the hydraulic head significantly over a simulation time of one day thus it can be concluded that the hydraulic conductivity is a deterministic parameter in the modeling of the hydraulic head the rmse c temporal temporal rmse of the solute concentration at wells 7 and 11 are 0 42 kg m3 and 0 721 kg m3 respectively and temporal b c b of the solute concentration at wells 7 and 11 are 0 368 kg m3 and 0 717 kg m3 respectively the temporal r c 2 r2 of the solute concentration at well 7 and 11 are 0 193 and 0 482 respectively which indicates poor fit between the observed and simulated solute concentrations thus it can be concluded that the errors in the solute concentration values are mainly due to the homogeneous solute transport parameters according to the literature dispersivity is one of the important parameters in assessing swi sanz and voss 2006 abarca et al 2007 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 from the model evaluation and the literature it can be concluded that the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity are the two deterministic parameters in the modeling of the swi 4 2 inverse modeling the optimal fit between the simulated and observed state variables are estimated by finding a set of anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity values a total of 1134 data points are used for the inverse modeling i e 44 temporal observed values on the hydraulic head and 37 temporal observed values on the tds at each observation well there are 75 pilot points in a 5 layered model and three parameters i e kxx kyy and αl are estimated at each pilot point a single iteration of the optimization requires approximately 160 h to estimate 225 values kxx kyy and αl on the 64 bit pathway a 3 07 ghz processor and 12 0 gb of ram from the 4th iteration only kxx and kyy parameters are considered since the relative change in αl values are 0 1 and time taken is reduced to approximately 71 h on the same configuration machine hence approximately 1620 h are required for the inverse model to terminate and the termination criterion is φ i φ min φ i 0 1 the estimated parameters from the inverse model are discussed in the following sections 4 2 1 hydraulic conductivity the statistics of the estimated hydraulic conductivities in x and y major axes are summarized in fig 8 a and b respectively the layerwise spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity in x and y major axes are shown in the figs 9 and 10 respectively along with the histograms from fig 8a it is observed that the overall hydraulic conductivity values along the x major axis range from 0 374 to 63 221 m d from fig 9 it can be noticed that the kxx values along the coastal length near the sea are 3 5 m d in layers 2 and 5 indicating the existence of a less permeable geological formation based on table 1 the following interpretations of the soil composition have been made layer 1 has 30 94 of coastal alluvium 47 91 of lateritic clay and 21 15 of laterite soil layer 2 has 60 75 of clayey sand or fine silt 9 87 of laterite soil and 29 38 of fissured rock lateritic clay layer 3 has 52 08 of clay and silt formation 10 48 of weathered zone and 37 44 of fissured rock lateritic clay layer 4 has 46 of clay and silt formation 50 81 of fissured bedrock and remaining of weathered bedrock layer 5 has 35 58 of clay silt zone 20 4 of weathered bedrock and 44 02 of the fissured rock from fig 10 the kyy values range from 0 53 to 30 m d which is not similar to that of kxx range because of the upper limit pj u in eq 3a for kyy was assigned a value of 30 m d this difference is due to groundwater flow to the sea along the x direction from the histograms of kyy and table 1 the soil type parallel to the coast can be interpreted as in layer 1 65 83 of elements are laterite soil out of which 47 9 for elements have the kyy value 30 m d 28 16 of lateritic clay and remaining is covered with coastal alluvium layer 2 is a homogeneous layer since 98 62 is clay silt formation layer 3 has 89 3 of clay and silt formation and remaining is fissured bedrock lateritic clay layer 4 has 67 51 of clay and remaining is fissured bedrock layer 5 fissured bedrock covers 68 38 29 76 of clay silt zone and remaining with a small amount of weathered bedrock from this it can be concluded that the layers parallel to the coast have no or thin layer of weathered bedrock also evident from fig 2 4 2 2 dispersivity the spatial distribution and statistics of the estimated αl at layer 1 are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively fig 11c is the histogram of the estimated αl from fig 11a it is observed that the αl values vary between 6 265 and 11 901 m at the wells 1 2 6 and 8 the αl 7 5 m at the wells 7 9 and 10 the αl ranges between 7 5 and 9 m and at remaining wells the αl 9 m the spatial distribution of αl in other layers are same as shown in the fig 11a the fig 11d shows the comparison between αl values estimated from the xu eckstein formula and the inverse model the wells 5 and 14 are not considered because l 1 km from the source and the rate of increase of dispersivity beyond 1 km can be neglected xu and eckstein 1995 at the well 4 the αl value from the inverse model exactly coincides with the αl value derived by the regression formula at wells 6 8 9 12 and 13 the αl values of the inverse model and from the regression equation are approximately the same 4 2 3 inverse calibrated model performance the temporal performance of the inverse calibrated model over time is evaluated by using r h 2 b h and rmse h table 4 the negative sign of b indicates that the inverse calibrated model underestimates the state variables and vice versa from table 4 it is observed that the mean temporal r h 2 r2 of the hydraulic head of the inverse calibrated model for the 14 observation wells over 3 years has improved by 1 64 times than the developed conceptual model which indicates better and improved fit between the observed and the simulated hydraulic heads the mean temporal b h b of the hydraulic head and mean rmse h temporal temporal rmse of the hydraulic head of the inverse calibrated model for the 14 observation wells over 3 years decreased by 75 7 and 50 8 respectively from the developed conceptual model fig 12 illustrates the monthly rmse h spatial spatial rmse for the hydraulic head over 14 observation wells the rmse h spatial has reduced by 64 for both the monsoon and non monsoon period when compared with the developed conceptual model from table 4 it can be observed that the temporal rc 2 improves in well 11 from 0 482 to 0 551 but the fit between the observed and simulated concentrations at well 7 is still poor this discrepancy may be because of the influence of the contaminated river on the adjacent observation well 7 the rmse c temporal at wells 7 and 11 reduced by 5 7 and 8 87 respectively and temporal b c at wells 7 and 11 reduced by 9 5 the reduction in errors of solute concentration is not 10 indicating the additional data requirement for the calibration 4 3 validation and verification 4 3 1 validation of the inverse calibrated model for the hydraulic head the model efficiency of the inverse calibrated model at each validation well is tabulated table 5 since there are only 4 wells the performance of the inverse calibrated model is validated only at well points and not spatially the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated hydraulic heads are 0 6 which indicates a good fit fig 13 compares the hydraulic head between the observed and simulated values the validation wells v3 and v4 which are located near the river fig 1b show good correlation which indicates that the given boundary condition for the river is accurate from fig 13 it can be noticed that at wells v1 and v2 there is a sudden increase in the observed hydraulic head of 3 m at the beginning of the monsoon which indicates that the requirement of the field investigation to understand this sudden change in the hydraulic head 4 3 2 validation of the inverse calibrated model for the solute concentration fig 14 a shows ert at profile l1 refer fig 1b these resistivity values are converted into equivalent tds values fig 14b using eq 11 and fig 14c represents the results of solute transport by the inverse calibrated model the results of the numerical model fig 14c are validated with the equivalent tds values fig 14b it can be observed that in fig 14b and c at 5 m below msl the tds values are 1500 mg l indicating the maximum intrusion at the same depth the resistivity values of the saturated clay and silt formation vary between 30 and 80 ω m refer to table 1 it is known that archie s law is not valid in the presence of clay formation thus the clay formation cannot be considered as swi at 170 270 m fig 14b to quantify the error in the simulated tds values the electrical resistivity data points are matched with the simulated tds data points based on the euclidean distance the data points with a euclidean distance 1 m are not considered for the model evaluation fig 15 a from the fig 15a the bias error between the equivalent and simulated tds values mostly lie between 0 2 and 0 2 kg m3 fig 15b illustrates the goodness of fit between the equivalent and simulated tds values the rmse and b are 0 213 kg m3 and 0 078 kg m3 respectively implying the confidence in the inverse calibrated model results the validation method adapted here is novel and is used to quantify the error between the measured and simulated results 4 3 3 verification of layering and geological formation the estimated hydraulic conductivity in x and y directions are verified for layering and geological formation table 1 i e by comparing the vertical 2d profile from the inverse calibrated model with ert image fig 16 for this verification the profiles t1 and l2 are considered such that they are located 1 km from the coastal line fig 1b and these profiles are not subjected to swi in the profile t1 fig 16a it is noticed that an average of 9 m thick saturated clayey formation is in between 1 m and 8 m and from the inverse calibrated model output 7 m thick saturated clayey formation on an average is found in between 2 m and 6 m in the profile l2 fig 16b it is seen that the inverse calibrated model can reproduce the clayey formation between 470 and 540 m distance the homogeneous pattern of the weathered zone can be noticed in the 2d sections of ert image and the inverse calibrated model result fig 16b from this observation it can be concluded that the interpolated layer thickness and the estimated geological formation is similar to the field measurements the parameter estimation approach at pilot points by using highly parameterized inverse model offers guidance on estimating anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity in real field layered unconfined aquifer involving swi the use of real field data such as appropriate initial aquifer parameters and constraining the inverse model with the upper and lower bounds of the parameters reduces the number of iterations required to minimize the objective function improve the potential estimates and possible convergence the inverted electrical resistivity output used for validation significantly supports the methodology adopted for the inverse modeling 5 summary and conclusions in this study a 3d variable density unconfined coastal aquifer model is developed by constraining the model with aquifer topography and appropriate initial field conditions from the forward modeling results it is observed that the anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity are the deterministic parameters to assess the swi in a coastal aquifer the inverse code pest is used to minimize the least square error for the state variables and to estimate these deterministic parameters a reliable validation method is adopted to evaluate the inverse calibrated model results with the ert profile the aquifer layering and the estimated geological formation are verified by comparing with ert images the study explains the necessity of considering layering and anisotropic heterogeneous aquifer parameters for effective simulation of swi the analysis gives knowledge about the geological formation in the study area the present study infers the following points the low performance of the developed conceptual model signifies the importance of considering spatially varying aquifer flow and solute transport parameters in all the layers the high error in the hydraulic head indicates that the hydraulic conductivity is one of the deterministic parameters since storage term does not influence the hydraulic head significantly over a simulation time of one day the inverse model used to estimate anisotropic spatially varying hydraulic conductivities and heterogeneous longitudinal dispersivity is computationally demanding but this effort is worthwhile to obtain the spatially varying aquifer parameters the inverse calibrated model results show substantial improvement error in the hydraulic head is reduced by 50 when compared with the developed conceptual model the error in the solute concentration is reduced by 10 which suggests additional data requirement though the least square error of the state variables is minimized at the observation wells the validation of the inverse calibrated model shows good results at the validation wells which significantly support the performance of the inverse calibrated model the tds values determined by the inverse calibrated model is evaluated with equivalent tds values computed from the electrical resistivities the inverse calibrated model results show better agreement with the field data and a novel validation method adapted is more reliable than the commonly used comparison validation the comparison verification of layering shows good agreement with the electrical resistivities layers the verification also shows that the inverse calibrated model is able to reproduce the field data the knowledge of geological formation normal and parallel to the coast has improved based on the estimated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity which can be used for the planning strategies and management of the aquifer system acknowledgments the authors thank johan hoareau jean michel vouillamoz

7006,the vaporization plane in porous media separates the region of capillary flow from the dry surface layer where the water transports only in its gas phase knowledge of the depth and geometry of the vaporization plane is critical for estimating water flux in the soil atmosphere interphase for understanding evaporating processes in general and for prediction of locations of damaging salt crystallization etc however detection of the vaporization plane is a challenging task this paper explores the use of sodium fluorescein dye uranine a popular hydrological tracer to visualize the vaporization plane in porous media uranine was used in the forms of solution or powder on sand sandstone and autoclaved aerated concrete in both laboratory and field experiments the property of uranine solution to change its color according to its concentration can be used to i visualize the vaporization plane by forming a distinctive dark orange zone where the pore water evaporates and ii to distinguish the zone of vapor flow from the zone where capillary flow is present similarly uranine powder when applied onto a porous material clearly visualizes the dry surface layer and the capillary zone divided by the vaporization plane this technique can also visualize a complex shaped vaporization plane in hydrophobic materials in comparison with other techniques such as sensible heat balance or heat pulse methods the use of uranine is accurate cost effective and straightforward abbreviations vp vaporization plane dsl dry surface layer cz capillary zone bb brilliant blue aa autoclaved aerated keywords evaporation capillary water drying front evaporation front capillary zone dry surface layer 1 introduction evaporation is a key process in the land atmosphere water balance additionally the near surface flow in porous media is an important topic for natural and engineering sciences such as agriculture soil science hydrology or studies of rock weathering building structures decay or endolithic biology evaporation from coarse porous media can be conceptually divided into three stages idso et al 1974 hillel 2004 or et al 2013 in the third stage a critical suction is reached in the subsurface and the so called vaporization plane vp is formed separating the region of the capillary zone cz with its capillary flow from the dry surface layer dsl where water flows only in the gas phase shokri et al 2009 mcallister et al 2016 in the cz where saturation is above the critical suction water flows via a network of partly saturated pores due to the pressure head gradient and its flow is usually described by richards 1931 equation in the dsl the water vapor movement is conceptually given by fick s law bittelli et al 2008 knowledge of the dsl thickness and the geometry of the vp are critical for estimating the water flux in the soil atmosphere interface and thus for understanding evaporation processes in general shokri and or 2011 bruthans et al 2018 an understanding of moisture dynamics in porous media is also crucial for the prediction of material decay for both building structures and natural outcrops fidríková et al 2013 mol and viles 2013 water represents one of the main degradation factors capable of seriously reducing the durability of materials falchi et al 2015 as well as being one of the most critical factors facilitating the growth of mold and microbes that can pose health hazards to people viitanen et al 2010 detection of the vp is particularly important in studying a material s decay by salt weathering as dissolved salts are transported by the capillary water and precipitated within the material they form crystals huinink et al 2004 with the resulting increased pressure caused by the crystallization leading to the material damage rijniers et al 2005 therefore the location of salt crystallization in the vp is closely related to material decay detection of the vp could also potentially be used in the soil science of semi arid regions where salinization of the soil is an important issue and an understanding of salt accumulation can lead to better agriculture practices kurtzman et al 2016 the vp can be located by several direct and indirect methods see table 1 in suppl mat as heat balance is an important factor controlling evaporation gupta 1974 mikhailov 1975 heat pulse or sensible heat balance methods can be used for its determination trautz et al 2014 these heat based methods are limited by needle spacing and they are required to be installed at precisely defined depth intervals xiao et al 2012 the vp can also be found by measuring the water content these methods are easy to employ and inexpensive the electric and magnetic based methods are either not accurate enough time domain reflectometry method topp et al 1982 or they are influenced by the amount of dissolved solids protimeters mol and viles 2010 identification of the vp is usually not possible by measuring the pressure head with tensiometers as the suction is out of measuring limits more demanding methods include nuclear magnetic resonance imaging reis et al 2003 sněhota et al 2010 lehoux et al 2016 x ray tomography rad et al 2015 acoustic emission grapsas and shokri 2014 neutron radiography deinert et al 2004 sacha et al 2015 confocal microscopy xu et al 2008 gamma ray densitometry shahidzadeh bonn et al 2007 and electrical resistivity tomography daily et al 1992 mol and viles 2010 the techniques used for detection of the vp within porous media require either special devices and or have a low spatial resolution for details about the methods and their limits see table 1 in suppl mat an easy to use and cost effective method with good resolution has to date been lacking in hydrological science the use of dyes is an attainable means to tackle the disadvantages of the methods mentioned above in several evaporation studies brilliant blue fcf dye tracer has been used to visualize the vp lehmann and or 2009 shokri et al 2009 however this has been found unsuitable for tracing the travel time of water because of its sorption properties kasteel et al 2002 concerning other uses of dyes uranine sodium fluorescein dye has recently been used to visualize the complex pattern of hydrophobicity in the biologically initiated rock crust on sandstones slavík et al 2017 and even the vp within sandstone bruthans et al 2018 the aim of this study was to test the use of uranine dye in solution and powder forms to visualize the vp cz and dsl in porous media the following steps were taken to reach the aim that is to test if this new method is viable in different porous media and under various boundary conditions in the first step we tested dissolved uranine dye to visualize the vp cz and dsl zones in sand sandstone and autoclaved concrete as examples of common natural and building materials correct distinction of the zones was verified by testing the material cohesion and by examining the presence of liquid water by a microscope at first tests were done under semi steady state of vp cz and dsl location later under transient conditions increased water supply from below or increased potential evaporation resulting in migration of the zones to test if the technique can trace former distribution of vp cz and dsl in already dried material specimens with uranine solution were dried completely and subsequently cut and inspected finally the technique was tested on sandstone samples with hydrophobic layer i e in complex environment in terms of capillary flow in the second step we compared the uranine and brilliant blue dyes ability to visualize the vp cz and dsl in sand in the third step uranine in the form of powder was tested in lab and field experiments to visualize the three zones in sandstone finally the applicability of the method using uranine solution or powder comparison with other methods and the need for future development of the proposed technique was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 dyes in the experiments presented herein we have used mainly uranine dye c20h10na2o5 and in one experiment brilliant blue fcf dye hereafter bb both obtained from sigma aldrich in powder form uranine is a dark red powder when dry and the color of a uranine water solution changes with decreasing concentration from red to orange to yellow and finally to light green käss 1998 fig 1 in suppl mat uranine unlike bb has the ability to fluoresce i e adsorb shorter wavelength light and emit at a longer wavelength at lower concentrations bb is always blue in color dark blue in dry powder form and lighter blue in water solution uranine discovered in 1871 is a manufactured organic compound usually used as a dye with numerous applications ranging from medicinal use can med assoc j 1959 mathew 2014 to forensics budowle et al 2000 and cosmetics in the natural sciences uranine is used in biochemical research as a common fluorophore in microscopy lakowicz 2006 and as a fluorescent probe in cytogenetic techniques noga and udomkusonsri 2002 in the earth sciences uranine is used as a rather conservative tracer in tracer tests and for the visualization of the preferential pathway s of groundwater flow for its relatively low reactive low sorbing properties in comparison with other organic dyes gaspar 1987 wilson et al 2016 even though sorption was observed to be significant on soils gerke et al 2008 for a summary of the available literature on uranine s main physical and chemical properties see gerke et al 2013 bb is an organic compound which besides being a food coloring is often used as a tracer in soil profile scale studies for the visualization of flow pathways in soils e g kasteel et al 2002 of the non fluorescent tracers flury and flühler 1995 concluded bb to be the best tracer to use because of its mobility visibility and low toxicity for bb s main physical and chemical properties see flury and flühler 1995 sorption characteristics of the dyes are important for migration of dye solutions in capillary form there are several adsorption studies of bb e g ketelsen and meyer windel 1999 germán heins and flury 2000 kasteel et al 2002 mon et al 2006 morris et al 2008 and uranine e g smart and laidlaw 1977 sabatini and austin 1991 kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 gerke et al 2008 gerke et al 2015 however as these studies were done for different types of soils and under different settings comparisons of these findings and predictions of a tracer s behavior in a particular experiment is difficult even though there is a study comparing the two dyes in their ability to stain preferential pathways vlček et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there has never been a study purposefully comparing sorption under neutral ph of the two dyes in the same material nevertheless based on the literature reviewed we expect bb to sorb more than uranine the basic properties of uranine and bb are shown in table 1 2 1 2 porous materials to test if the technique is applicable for various porous materials several common natural and building materials were used sand sandstone sandstone with natural hydrophobic layer and autoclaved aerated aa concrete the sand and gravel the later used as a drain in a bottom of experimental setup only used in the experiments were from the kaznejov quarry czech rep certified sieves were used to determine the grain sizes of the loose materials both dominating in quartz 0 2 2 mm for the sand and 2 4 mm for the gravel the sandstone used both with and without the hydrophobic layer was a medium fine grained quartz sandstone from the bohemian cretaceous basin czech rep with grain sizes from 0 25 to 0 5 mm for details see bruthans et al 2018 we used aa concrete with the commercial name ytong p2 500 having a dry bulk density of 475 25 kg m3 and pore diameters 3 5 mm field observations were done at the exposures of fine to coarse grained quartz sandstone from the bohemian cretaceous basin czech rep 60 70 km ne from prague further details about the materials used are given in table 2 in suppl mat 2 2 methods porosity of the compact materials used was measured by high pressure mercury porosimetry using an autopore iv 9520 instrument micromeritics usa and the skeletal true density ρhe was determined by means of a gas pycnometer instrument for more details see supplementary material by slavík et al 2017 porosity of the sand was calculated from the dry bulk density dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 hrs of the sample with known volume capillary water absorption cwa of cores of the compact materials was measured using a sauter fh 50 n tensiometer d 0 01 n capacity 50 n the bottom base of the core was put in contact with the water surface and the weight of the core was recorded at one second intervals until the maximum moisture content was reached by capillary uptake decrease of the water level during measurement was negligible 1 mm the cwa was calculated as the weight of water absorbed per unit area per unit of time gm 2s 1 potential evaporation was measured gravimetrically by evaporation of water from pvc cups diameter 103 mm height 395 mm there were three cups in the laboratory environment two of which had controlled wind speed at the cup surface 2 5 0 5 m s and 1 0 0 3 m s and the last was in the environment with ambient air motion the water table was kept between 5 and 15 mm from the top of the cups a portable digital levenhuk dtx 500 mobi microscope magnification 20 200 was used to obtain detailed visualization of the uranine solution in the pore space the wind speeds were measured with thermal anemometer model ta 410 xy airflow by greisinger electronic gmbh all experiments were photo documented 2 3 experimental setup we carried out both laboratory and field experiments the design of the presented experiments and the solution concentrations used are based on several preliminary experiments and here we show only the final experimental setups which are demonstrating specific settings of boundary initial conditions the results of the preliminary experiments nevertheless fully correspond to the results presented in this paper the uranine and bb dyes were applied in the form of water solutions which were prepared in the lab by dissolving the respective dye powder in distilled water concentrations are given below and in table 2 in suppl mat uranine was also used in the form of a dry powder both in the lab and the field in all the laboratory experiments ambient temperature and relative humidity of the air and or potential evaporation were measured for overview on all tests and further specifications concerning individual experiments see table 2 and fig 2 in suppl mat 2 3 1 experiments with dye solutions the porous material was first dried in the laboratory environment 19 21 c 35 40 relative humidity until no change in sample weight occurred within a 24 hrs interval there were three reasons for this experimental setting i for the samples to be in equilibrium with the surrounding environment to eliminate any uncontrolled moisture uptake from the water vapor in laboratory atmosphere ii to reach more or less the same moisture of all the samples and iii because the organisms colonizing the sandstone core in exp 1e see further would not survive oven drying unless stated otherwise the experiments were carried out in the same laboratory environment to ensure homogenization of the sand and its minimal compaction the material was carefully placed into glass containers while being continuously mixed with a metal rod changes in the color of the samples resulting from the solution s transport were photo documented the samples were saturated via the entire bottom boundary with dye solutions this approach was chosen for four reasons i in order to make the experiments more rapid in case of full saturation and subsequent drying the experiment would take longer time ii it enables uniform absorption of solution via the respected surface area and its more or less uniform movement throughout the sample and iii this setting helps in clear visual distinction of the three zones if we first saturated the sample and let it evaporate there would be uranine precipitated in the dsl and thus the vp would not be seen as a visually distinctive line and iv saturation via a bottom boundary and evaporation via upper boundary replicates moisture distribution in many natural settings e g bruthans et al 2018 concerning the volumes of dye solutions injected we used just enough solution for the vp to form inside a sample that is to form the three zones in a sample at the same time dsl vp and cz by injecting the limited volume of solution we avoided cz to rise by capillary forces all the way up to the surface 2 3 1 1 experiment 1a this experiment was conducted to test if dissolved uranine dye correctly visualizes the vp cz and dsl in sand a glass container 7 15 15 cm sealed from all sides except the top boundary where evaporation took place was uniformly filled with sand above a 1 cm thick basal layer of gravel serving as a drain that helped to redistribute the injected solution in the middle of the container a plastic tube was vertically placed to enable injection of the solution into the gravel at the bottom the experiment was carried out under a constant wind speed condition 1 0 0 3 m s maintained by an electrical fan at the top boundary uranine solution 2 g l was injected through the plastic tube into the gravel 90 ml one time only after the injection the plastic tube was plugged with a plastic stopper to avoid evaporation from the drain after the experiment and documentation of vp by uranine s color the containers were tilted 45 to separate the dry loose sand from wet capillary held sand to verify the vp position for details see fig 2 in suppl mat 2 3 1 2 experiment 1b this experiment was performed to test if dissolved uranine dye visualizes the vp cz and dsl in compact materials a sandstone core and an aa concrete core 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter were placed into two pvc cups closed all around except the top boundaries to avoid evaporation from the cores sides and bottoms uranine solution 1 3 3 g l 20 30 ml for details see table 2 in suppl mat was injected into the bottom one time only of the cups making sure that it is absorbed by the sample through its bottom boundary only 2 3 1 3 experiment 1c to test if the zones are traceable under transient conditions increased water supply from below or increased potential evaporation resulting in migration of the zones experiment 1c was carried out using the same experimental settings as exp 1a using two glass containers 7 15 15 cm wind speed conditions were controlled throughout the experiment maintained by electrical fans to sustain the desired potential evaporation in both containers under wind speed of 1 0 3 m s uranine solution 2 g l was injected through the plastic tubes into the gravel 90 ml which were plugged by stoppers after the injection once the solution stopped moving upwards 7 days the two containers were treated in different ways in the first container windspeed of the fan was increased to 2 5 0 5 m s to push the vp down after the documentation of the vp by uranine s color the container was tilted 45 to verify the vp position see exp 1a for reasoning in the second container more uranine solution was injected to the bottom 120 ml 2 g l to push the vp further up after the solution stopped moving upwards after another xx days it was photo documented and the container was tilted to verify the vp position 2 3 1 4 experiment 1d to test if the technique can trace former distribution of vp cz and dsl in already dried material a sandstone core 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter was placed into an open plastic container enabling evaporation from all the sides except the bottom filled with a 2 cm layer of uranine solution at its base 2 6 g l the uranine solution moved upwards due to capillary uptake the core was periodically weighted 1 2 days and after three weeks when the material had dried no measurable change in sample weight during 24hrs occurred the sample was cut in half photo documented and subsequently the cut surface was made wet by 1 ml of distilled water to partly remobilize the precipitated uranine and in 15 min photo documented again 2 3 1 5 experiment 1e to test the uranine solution on materials with uneven capillary flow and complex vp geometry a sandstone core was used 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter with naturally developed biologically initiated rock crust consisting of hydrophobic organic matter for details see slavík et al 2017 who studied the same material on its upper base of uneven surface the core was placed into a pvc cup like in exp 1b and uranine was repeatedly added into the bottom of the cup 1 3 g l see table 3 in suppl mat a sandstone core of the same size and under the same experimental settings but without crust was used for comparison at the sandstone core s upper base a pit 20 mm deep and 30 mm in diameter was hollowed out to i enable comparison with the similar surface of the sample with the crust ii to observe dye precipitation once water reaches the surface iii to test whether the solution is moving uniformly throughout the core the weight of the cores was monitored 2 3 1 6 experiment 2 in experiment 2 we compared the effectiveness of the uranine and bb dye solutions to visualize the vp cz and dsl in sand bb dye had been already used in evaporation studies e g lehmann and or 2009 shokri et al 2009 two 400 ml glass beakers were uniformly packed with sand into one 10 ml of 1 3 g l uranine solution was injected 10 ml of 0 4 g l bb solution was injected into the other beaker concentrations of both dyes were determined from preliminary tests to ensure ideal visibility both injections were performed by a medical needle that run via the middle of the sample to the very bottom the samples were left in the laboratory environment to evaporate for 18 hrs after the experiment and documentation of vp by uranine s color the containers were tilted 45 to verify the vp position see exp 1a for reasoning 2 3 2 experiments with uranine powder 2 3 2 1 experiment 3a the laboratory experiment 3a was testing uranine powder to visualize the vp cz and dsl zones in sandstone a sandstone core 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter was placed into an open plastic container filled with 2 cm of water at its base after 5 min the core was taken out of the water and uranine powder was dusted onto the sandstone core s surface using a makeup brush after 2 min it was photo documented 2 3 2 2 experiment 3b in the field holes were drilled 80 mm diameter 60 mm depth with a core drill bit into the natural sandstone body perpendicular to the rock surface in various directions from vertical to horizontal drilling was done without the use of water or air flushing to avoid wetting or drying of the environment drilling took several tens of seconds and care was taken not to heat the drill bit considerably to avoid evaporation once the drilling was finished uranine powder was immediately applied onto the sides of the drilled hole and onto the surrounding surface of the sandstone by dusting the powder using a makeup brush after 5 min it was photo documented 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiments with uranine dye solution in the evaporation experiments we injected uranine solution into the bottom of both loose and compact materials and let the solution evaporate in porous media in all cases we observed after several hours days that the uranine solution forms two differently colored zones in porous media 1 a yellow color zone and 2 a distinctive dark orange zone fig 1 the yellow color zone 1 was colored by the solution and therefore represents the volume where uranine was carried by liquid water this flow is presumably due to capillary forces and hereafter we call 1 the capillary zone cz on the contrary the dark orange color 2 is a consequence of increased uranine concentration käss 1998 which can only be explained by evaporation within the media if the solution in the cz was adsorbed to the material s particles we would see a gradual color change as adsorption increases with solution concentration appelo and postma 2013 therefore the increased uranine concentration clearly indicates evaporation within the porous material the vaporization plane vp dividing the cz below from the dry surface layer dsl above fig 1 we hence state that the yellow color zone represents the cz the dark orange zone stands for the vp and the non colored area points to the dsl where water moves in the form of vapor only and thus not transporting any dye to further prove that the yellow zone is equivalent to the cz and the non colored zone equivalent to the dsl we checked the presence of water cohesion forces by tilting the glass container after experiment exp 2 with sand at an angle of 45 the particles above the vp were loose and separated from the rest of the material fig 2 this demonstrated the lack of cohesion forces in the dsl as capillary menisci were not present in the dry medium note that the described drying process change in vp location is slow and that any measurable change takes hours therefore seconds long tilting of the container does not change the location of the vp to further identify the differences between the three zones we used a microscope below the vp the particles appeared shiny as water formed very thin films fig 2b at the vp one could distinguish some particles being covered with uranine solution films of a dark orange color fig 2c above the vp the sand particles appeared dim and dry partly covered with what appears to be fines disintegrated from the particles fig 2d the spatial distribution of the dark orange zone and the yellow zone can change over time which could be due to e g an increased water supply below the vp or an increased potential evaporation above the vp there are two basic scenarios either the vp moves toward the surface progresses fig 3 a or it retreats into the material fig 3b in the first scenario the observed color correctly reflects the current situation as the uranine solution moves to the previously dry not colored portions and the former dark orange zone of the vp dissolves into the advancing capillary solution still remnants of the former vp may be visible in the cz especially if the former vp was stabilized for a longer time in the second case when the cz shrinks and the dsl expands into the region formerly occupied by cz the dark orange zone either thickens and or several dark orange strips are formed below the former vp fig 3b in this case the actual vp is represented by the lowest dark orange strip while the other dark orange strips are remnants of the retreating vp this was tested by tilting the samples to summarize uranine can partly overprint previous stages of moisture distribution however in the case of drying it is necessary to interpret the dark orange zone in the context of its former positions and the change of conditions uranine solution can thus reveal some information about the evolution of the moisture system whether the cz was retreating or progressing towards the surface in all the cases presented above the cz was observed while the sample was still wet see table 2 in suppl mat in some cases it can be advantageous to observe the results of the experiment after a complete drying of the sample so that the cz and vp are not present in the sample anymore the former spatial distributions of the cz and vp can still be imprinted into the material in particular clear visualization of the former cz and vp occurs if the vp is present at a constant depth for a relatively long time this is the case documented in fig 4 a where the entire sandstone core was initially wet through its bottom with uranine solution subsequently it was allowed to evaporate in an open environment until it became completely dry until the weight of the sample was in steady state and then was cut in half because of the high initial saturation of the sample and the relatively fast evaporation the vp was thus at the very surface of the sample during most of the drying process and hence the imprinting of the cz yellow zone and the vp dark orange zone close to the surface however when the vp changed its position relatively quickly its imprinting into the material was not apparent the inside of the core in fig 4a or was limited variously colored zone between the former and current vps in fig 3b when using a material with some precipitated uranine already present the observations should also be interpreted with caution as this influences the resulting color this is visible from fig 4b where after wetting the cut dry surface with drops of distilled water a new spatially limited area of capillary water was established as the distilled water was spreading sideways and thus dissolving the precipitated uranine in the material along the way the boundaries of the wet zone continuously changed its color from yellow to light orange therefore only the border of the area of this water spread was forming a distinctive light orange line even though evaporation must have taken place from the entire area wetted by the distilled water see fig 4b we tested whether it is possible to visualize the vp in the special case of a sandstone core with a hydrophobic layer uranine visualized that the hydrophobic layer at the top of the core a few mm thick slavík et al 2017 hindered the upward movement of the solution so that the capillary flow was not permitted to reach the very top of the core resulting in an uneven geometry of the vp fig 5 a in comparison in the same sandstone material except without the hydrophobic layer the vp was smooth and uniform fig 5b thanks to the knowledge of the current thickness of the cz as indicated by the orange color one can calculate the water content of the wet part of the sample which otherwise would not be possible fig 6 for further details see tables 3 and 4 in suppl mat therefore uranine visualization of the vp is effective even in materials where the vp has an intricate geometry e g heterogeneous materials fractured zones materials with hydrophobic portions etc the concentration of uranine in all the previously described experiments was between 1 3 and 3 0 g l depending on the color of the porous material used ideally the concentration should be kept low because of the possible clogging of pores by precipitated dye however it needs to be high enough so that its yellow color will be detectable on the material 3 2 comparison of uranine and bb solutions we injected bb solution into the bottom of the glass containers filled with dry sand and allowed the material to become wet at a certain level as the solution was moving upwards it started to evaporate subsequently we compared bb s behavior with the behavior of uranine despite performed under the same conditions the amounts of solutions injected the sand used and the same experimental procedures including limited packing of the material the height of the colored zones was not identical uranine colored the sand up to 8 cm in high while bb only up to 7 5 cm high over the same time period fig 7 more importantly we observed that bb does not exactly visualize the wetting front as wet parts were visually detectable above the bb line unlike with uranine similar behaviors have been reported by several studies that used bb as a tracer where the dye patterns did not exactly match the wetting front during infiltration flury and flühler 1995 devitt and smith 2002 kasteel et al 2002 this can be explained by stronger retardation of the bb therefore even though bb can be successfully used as a tracer in evaporation drying experiments when the material is saturated and let to dry i e when the vp is receding it is not always able to indicate the current wetting front and vp 3 3 experiments with uranine powder uranine can be used in the form of a dry red powder to visualize the dsl and cz after dusting it onto the surface of a porous material with the dsl and cz present two different color zones can be recognized 1 a dark orange zone and 2 a red color zone fig 8 the dark orange zone 1 is the result of dissolution of the originally dry red powder into pore water and the red color zone 2 indicates that no dissolution of the dry red powder occurs as the material remains dry in this area fig 8a b therefore the spatial distribution of the colors describes the spatial distribution of moisture within the porous media the dark orange zone represents the cz whereas the red color zone represents the dsl unlike the uranine solution application dusting with uranine powder does not explicitly highlight the vp the vp can only be assumed at the border between the two differently colored parts fig 8a b representing the cz and dsl unlike with the use of uranine solution the powder visualizes a single time frame and therefore does not allow one to study the moisture system s history thus it is not possible to distinguish whether the vp is retreating or if it is progressing towards the surface in fact there might be no vp at all in the case that the wetting front is progressing or when there is a lack of potential evaporation at the surface the change in color due to dissolution took 2 5 min according to the moisture content and or the thickness of the powder layer applied for the correct use of the uranine powder dusting method the spread of the powder must be uniform to reach quite a constant thickness otherwise there is a risk that the powder will not dissolve uniformly and thus an apparent but false dry area will be observed fig 8c 3 4 method utilization and comparison with other methods in the laboratory the use of uranine is applicable in almost any conceivable flow and evaporation experiments the decision whether to use it in the solution or powder form depends on the purpose of the experiment the advantage of using a solution is its ability to visualize the flow history as the dye is already present in the transported liquid and zones locations changes can be photo documented repeatedly for long time periods in addition to that if the solution transport throughout the media is well photo documented the water flow velocity is easily computable and any possible preferential flow can be detected this utilization is based on the properties that uranine has in common with other dyes used in the vadose zone e g bb rhodamine b or pyranine flury and wai 2003 gaspar 1987 wilson et al 2016 we would like to underscore the use of uranine dye solution for visualization of evaporation and its ability to rapidly reflect the dynamics of the water system however there are cases when it is not convenient or advisable to use uranine solution perhaps the most significant disadvantage of the use of uranine solution is in the study of evaporation in the field which has limited applicability as the solution needs to be added to the environment this changes the hydraulic field and is also demanding of time as the evaporation processes might be relatively slow other drawbacks of using solution are the possible clogging of the pores and possible density changes due to different concentrations of the original liquid in the pore space and injected into the solution another disadvantage of uranine application is its property to photodegrade käss 1998 gaigalas et al 2004 with a photodecomposition decay coefficient k 9 5 10 2 3 9 10 1 under sunny conditions dimensionless for details see review by smart and laidlaw 1977 therefore it is essential to prevent or minimize the exposure of uranine to light during experiments the use of the powder can overcome some of the drawbacks of using uranine solution as it can be applied without altering the hydraulic field and its use is relatively quick when the powder is used it is sufficient to dust it onto the surface and within minutes the color zones are displayed the use of powder is especially practical in the field where it can effectively visualize the dsl and cz however repeated use of uranine powder is not possible in situ in drilled or burrowed holes if the holes are not sealed by a material with similar properties between readings because the open hole affects the evaporation rate and therefore repeated readings of the vp depth would be different from ambient conditions we suggest using uranine dye on all ranges of evaporation experiments from the mm to m scale uranine solution can be especially practical to use in wetting evaporation experiments as it indicates the current wetting front and forms a distinctive visualization of the vp the use of uranine solution to visualize preferential pathways in the field is a well known and widespread practice wilson et al 2016 however we are not aware of any study using uranine to visualize sub surface evaporation from cracks or other preferential pathways we believe that the use of uranine offers a simple method for such studies and possibly enables differentiation between evaporation and transpiration as plant roots uptake the uranine solution palmquist 1939 and thus not causing a higher concentration of uranine in the soil the powder use can find applications in studies focused on near sub surface water movements in rock outcrops buildings and sculptures made of porous rocks when we compare the use of uranine to visualize sub surface evaporation dynamics with other methods we find that even though they are often more precise they are also more expensive and not so easily accessible for details see table 1 in suppl mat this is the case for nuclear magnetic resonance x ray tomography neutron radiography confocal microscopy and gamma ray densitometry these methods are also not possible to use effectively in the field easily employable and inexpensive methods such as the electrical resistivity tomography the heat based methods and tensiometry are less precise overall in comparison with other methods the use of uranine dye is both an easy to use and cost effective 140 usd per kg method with a fair resolution note that the electrical resistivity tomography at this research stage remains to be the only inexpensive and non destructive method which is relevant when working on heritage sites or protected areas of rock outcrops mol and viles 2013 3 5 need for future development when using uranine to visualize evaporation one can only observe a 2d view of the moisture distribution at the surface in order to gain knowledge about the insides of the material destructive approach digging drilling excavation is needed for both the solution and the powder methods figs 4 and 8b c this hinders the wider use of uranine in studying moisture at protected natural rock outcrops or in building structures and statues where any destructive approach is not acceptable here we presented the visualization of the vp in the 80 mm wide burrowed drilled holes and so far we are limited by the hole being sufficiently wide to ensure a clear view of the line between the cz and dsl therefore significant progress in miniaturization of this invasive method is needed concerning the use of uranine solution we observed that if the vp is fixed for a relatively long time precipitation of uranine occurs even though we did not observe any role of this clogging upon the evaporation rate we believe that more research is needed to quantify this in relationship to the water flow dynamics here we have presented experiments conducted in porous materials with the porosity of sand and thus another area that requires further research is the use of uranine in evaporation studies within materials of different pore sizes such as clays or gravels additionally we suggest conducting more research on the role of uranine solution concentration on evaporation rates as well as a study comparing the use of uranine to other commonly used dyes not mentioned in this paper such as rhodamine b or pyranine 4 conclusion this paper has presented several examples where uranine dye was used to visualize the vaporization plane capillary zone and the dry surface layer the uranine solution visualizes the vaporization plane by forming a distinctive dark orange zone caused by evaporation of the pore water and hence increased uranine concentration the use of uranine also enables one to distinguish the zones of vapor and capillary flow thanks either to the visualization of the vaporization plane by the uranine solution or by application of the uranine powder on porous materials when compared to the brilliant blue dye uranine solution has lower retardation and better visualizes both the capillary zone and the vaporization plane thus it should be the dye of choice for all kinds of evaporation experiments uranine dye can find use in various laboratory evaporation experiments and field studies of sub surface evaporation from both soil and rock outcrops even though this method is destructive in compact materials if miniaturized it might be used to detect the vaporization plane and the salt enriched zone in cultural heritage sites overall the presented

7006,the vaporization plane in porous media separates the region of capillary flow from the dry surface layer where the water transports only in its gas phase knowledge of the depth and geometry of the vaporization plane is critical for estimating water flux in the soil atmosphere interphase for understanding evaporating processes in general and for prediction of locations of damaging salt crystallization etc however detection of the vaporization plane is a challenging task this paper explores the use of sodium fluorescein dye uranine a popular hydrological tracer to visualize the vaporization plane in porous media uranine was used in the forms of solution or powder on sand sandstone and autoclaved aerated concrete in both laboratory and field experiments the property of uranine solution to change its color according to its concentration can be used to i visualize the vaporization plane by forming a distinctive dark orange zone where the pore water evaporates and ii to distinguish the zone of vapor flow from the zone where capillary flow is present similarly uranine powder when applied onto a porous material clearly visualizes the dry surface layer and the capillary zone divided by the vaporization plane this technique can also visualize a complex shaped vaporization plane in hydrophobic materials in comparison with other techniques such as sensible heat balance or heat pulse methods the use of uranine is accurate cost effective and straightforward abbreviations vp vaporization plane dsl dry surface layer cz capillary zone bb brilliant blue aa autoclaved aerated keywords evaporation capillary water drying front evaporation front capillary zone dry surface layer 1 introduction evaporation is a key process in the land atmosphere water balance additionally the near surface flow in porous media is an important topic for natural and engineering sciences such as agriculture soil science hydrology or studies of rock weathering building structures decay or endolithic biology evaporation from coarse porous media can be conceptually divided into three stages idso et al 1974 hillel 2004 or et al 2013 in the third stage a critical suction is reached in the subsurface and the so called vaporization plane vp is formed separating the region of the capillary zone cz with its capillary flow from the dry surface layer dsl where water flows only in the gas phase shokri et al 2009 mcallister et al 2016 in the cz where saturation is above the critical suction water flows via a network of partly saturated pores due to the pressure head gradient and its flow is usually described by richards 1931 equation in the dsl the water vapor movement is conceptually given by fick s law bittelli et al 2008 knowledge of the dsl thickness and the geometry of the vp are critical for estimating the water flux in the soil atmosphere interface and thus for understanding evaporation processes in general shokri and or 2011 bruthans et al 2018 an understanding of moisture dynamics in porous media is also crucial for the prediction of material decay for both building structures and natural outcrops fidríková et al 2013 mol and viles 2013 water represents one of the main degradation factors capable of seriously reducing the durability of materials falchi et al 2015 as well as being one of the most critical factors facilitating the growth of mold and microbes that can pose health hazards to people viitanen et al 2010 detection of the vp is particularly important in studying a material s decay by salt weathering as dissolved salts are transported by the capillary water and precipitated within the material they form crystals huinink et al 2004 with the resulting increased pressure caused by the crystallization leading to the material damage rijniers et al 2005 therefore the location of salt crystallization in the vp is closely related to material decay detection of the vp could also potentially be used in the soil science of semi arid regions where salinization of the soil is an important issue and an understanding of salt accumulation can lead to better agriculture practices kurtzman et al 2016 the vp can be located by several direct and indirect methods see table 1 in suppl mat as heat balance is an important factor controlling evaporation gupta 1974 mikhailov 1975 heat pulse or sensible heat balance methods can be used for its determination trautz et al 2014 these heat based methods are limited by needle spacing and they are required to be installed at precisely defined depth intervals xiao et al 2012 the vp can also be found by measuring the water content these methods are easy to employ and inexpensive the electric and magnetic based methods are either not accurate enough time domain reflectometry method topp et al 1982 or they are influenced by the amount of dissolved solids protimeters mol and viles 2010 identification of the vp is usually not possible by measuring the pressure head with tensiometers as the suction is out of measuring limits more demanding methods include nuclear magnetic resonance imaging reis et al 2003 sněhota et al 2010 lehoux et al 2016 x ray tomography rad et al 2015 acoustic emission grapsas and shokri 2014 neutron radiography deinert et al 2004 sacha et al 2015 confocal microscopy xu et al 2008 gamma ray densitometry shahidzadeh bonn et al 2007 and electrical resistivity tomography daily et al 1992 mol and viles 2010 the techniques used for detection of the vp within porous media require either special devices and or have a low spatial resolution for details about the methods and their limits see table 1 in suppl mat an easy to use and cost effective method with good resolution has to date been lacking in hydrological science the use of dyes is an attainable means to tackle the disadvantages of the methods mentioned above in several evaporation studies brilliant blue fcf dye tracer has been used to visualize the vp lehmann and or 2009 shokri et al 2009 however this has been found unsuitable for tracing the travel time of water because of its sorption properties kasteel et al 2002 concerning other uses of dyes uranine sodium fluorescein dye has recently been used to visualize the complex pattern of hydrophobicity in the biologically initiated rock crust on sandstones slavík et al 2017 and even the vp within sandstone bruthans et al 2018 the aim of this study was to test the use of uranine dye in solution and powder forms to visualize the vp cz and dsl in porous media the following steps were taken to reach the aim that is to test if this new method is viable in different porous media and under various boundary conditions in the first step we tested dissolved uranine dye to visualize the vp cz and dsl zones in sand sandstone and autoclaved concrete as examples of common natural and building materials correct distinction of the zones was verified by testing the material cohesion and by examining the presence of liquid water by a microscope at first tests were done under semi steady state of vp cz and dsl location later under transient conditions increased water supply from below or increased potential evaporation resulting in migration of the zones to test if the technique can trace former distribution of vp cz and dsl in already dried material specimens with uranine solution were dried completely and subsequently cut and inspected finally the technique was tested on sandstone samples with hydrophobic layer i e in complex environment in terms of capillary flow in the second step we compared the uranine and brilliant blue dyes ability to visualize the vp cz and dsl in sand in the third step uranine in the form of powder was tested in lab and field experiments to visualize the three zones in sandstone finally the applicability of the method using uranine solution or powder comparison with other methods and the need for future development of the proposed technique was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 dyes in the experiments presented herein we have used mainly uranine dye c20h10na2o5 and in one experiment brilliant blue fcf dye hereafter bb both obtained from sigma aldrich in powder form uranine is a dark red powder when dry and the color of a uranine water solution changes with decreasing concentration from red to orange to yellow and finally to light green käss 1998 fig 1 in suppl mat uranine unlike bb has the ability to fluoresce i e adsorb shorter wavelength light and emit at a longer wavelength at lower concentrations bb is always blue in color dark blue in dry powder form and lighter blue in water solution uranine discovered in 1871 is a manufactured organic compound usually used as a dye with numerous applications ranging from medicinal use can med assoc j 1959 mathew 2014 to forensics budowle et al 2000 and cosmetics in the natural sciences uranine is used in biochemical research as a common fluorophore in microscopy lakowicz 2006 and as a fluorescent probe in cytogenetic techniques noga and udomkusonsri 2002 in the earth sciences uranine is used as a rather conservative tracer in tracer tests and for the visualization of the preferential pathway s of groundwater flow for its relatively low reactive low sorbing properties in comparison with other organic dyes gaspar 1987 wilson et al 2016 even though sorption was observed to be significant on soils gerke et al 2008 for a summary of the available literature on uranine s main physical and chemical properties see gerke et al 2013 bb is an organic compound which besides being a food coloring is often used as a tracer in soil profile scale studies for the visualization of flow pathways in soils e g kasteel et al 2002 of the non fluorescent tracers flury and flühler 1995 concluded bb to be the best tracer to use because of its mobility visibility and low toxicity for bb s main physical and chemical properties see flury and flühler 1995 sorption characteristics of the dyes are important for migration of dye solutions in capillary form there are several adsorption studies of bb e g ketelsen and meyer windel 1999 germán heins and flury 2000 kasteel et al 2002 mon et al 2006 morris et al 2008 and uranine e g smart and laidlaw 1977 sabatini and austin 1991 kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 gerke et al 2008 gerke et al 2015 however as these studies were done for different types of soils and under different settings comparisons of these findings and predictions of a tracer s behavior in a particular experiment is difficult even though there is a study comparing the two dyes in their ability to stain preferential pathways vlček et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there has never been a study purposefully comparing sorption under neutral ph of the two dyes in the same material nevertheless based on the literature reviewed we expect bb to sorb more than uranine the basic properties of uranine and bb are shown in table 1 2 1 2 porous materials to test if the technique is applicable for various porous materials several common natural and building materials were used sand sandstone sandstone with natural hydrophobic layer and autoclaved aerated aa concrete the sand and gravel the later used as a drain in a bottom of experimental setup only used in the experiments were from the kaznejov quarry czech rep certified sieves were used to determine the grain sizes of the loose materials both dominating in quartz 0 2 2 mm for the sand and 2 4 mm for the gravel the sandstone used both with and without the hydrophobic layer was a medium fine grained quartz sandstone from the bohemian cretaceous basin czech rep with grain sizes from 0 25 to 0 5 mm for details see bruthans et al 2018 we used aa concrete with the commercial name ytong p2 500 having a dry bulk density of 475 25 kg m3 and pore diameters 3 5 mm field observations were done at the exposures of fine to coarse grained quartz sandstone from the bohemian cretaceous basin czech rep 60 70 km ne from prague further details about the materials used are given in table 2 in suppl mat 2 2 methods porosity of the compact materials used was measured by high pressure mercury porosimetry using an autopore iv 9520 instrument micromeritics usa and the skeletal true density ρhe was determined by means of a gas pycnometer instrument for more details see supplementary material by slavík et al 2017 porosity of the sand was calculated from the dry bulk density dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 hrs of the sample with known volume capillary water absorption cwa of cores of the compact materials was measured using a sauter fh 50 n tensiometer d 0 01 n capacity 50 n the bottom base of the core was put in contact with the water surface and the weight of the core was recorded at one second intervals until the maximum moisture content was reached by capillary uptake decrease of the water level during measurement was negligible 1 mm the cwa

395 mm there were three cups in the laboratory environment two of which had controlled wind speed at the cup surface 2 5 0 5 m s and 1 0 0 3 m s and the last was in the environment with ambient air motion the water table was kept between 5 and 15 mm from the top of the cups a portable digital levenhuk dtx 500 mobi microscope magnification 20 200 was used to obtain detailed visualization of the uranine solution in the pore space the wind speeds were measured with thermal anemometer model ta 410 xy airflow by greisinger electronic gmbh all experiments were photo documented 2 3 experimental setup we carried out both laboratory and field experiments the design of the presented experiments and the solution concentrations used are based on several preliminary experiments and here we show only the final experimental setups which are demonstrating specific settings of boundary initial conditions the results of the preliminary experiments nevertheless fully correspond to the results presented in this paper the uranine and bb dyes were applied in the form of water solutions which were prepared in the lab by dissolving the respective dye powder in distilled water concentrations are given below and in table 2 in suppl mat uranine was also used in the form of a dry powder both in the lab and the field in all the laboratory experiments ambient temperature and relative humidity of the air and or potential evaporation were measured for overview on all tests and further specifications concerning individual experiments see table 2 and fig 2 in suppl mat 2 3 1 experiments with dye solutions the porous material was first dried in the laboratory environment 19 21 c 35 40 relative humidity until no change in sample weight occurred within a 24 hrs interval there were three reasons for this experimental setting i for the samples to be in equilibrium with the surrounding environment to eliminate any uncontrolled moisture uptake from the water vapor in laboratory atmosphere ii to reach more or less the same moisture of all the samples and iii because the organisms colonizing the sandstone core in exp 1e see further would not survive oven drying unless stated otherwise the experiments were carried out in the same laboratory environment to ensure homogenization of the sand and its minimal compaction the material was carefully placed into glass containers while being continuously mixed with a metal rod changes in the color of the samples resulting from the solution s transport were photo documented the samples were saturated via the entire bottom boundary with dye solutions this approach was chosen for four reasons i in order to make the experiments more rapid in case of full saturation and subsequent drying the experiment would take longer time ii it enables uniform absorption of solution via the respected surface area and its more or less uniform movement throughout the sample and iii this setting helps in clear visual distinction of the three zones if we first saturated the sample and let it evaporate there would be uranine precipitated in the dsl and thus the vp would not be seen as a visually distinctive line and iv saturation via a bottom boundary and evaporation via upper boundary replicates moisture distribution in many natural settings e g bruthans et al 2018 concerning the volumes of dye solutions injected we used just enough solution for the vp to form inside a sample that is to form the three zones in a sample at the same time dsl vp and cz by injecting the limited volume of solution we avoided cz to rise by capillary forces all the way up to the surface 2 3 1 1 experiment 1a this experiment was conducted to test if dissolved uranine dye correctly visualizes the vp cz and dsl in sand a glass container 7 15 15 cm sealed from all sides except the top boundary where evaporation took place was uniformly filled with sand above a 1 cm thick basal layer of gravel serving as a drain that helped to redistribute the injected solution in the middle of the container a plastic tube was vertically placed to enable injection of the solution into the gravel at the bottom the experiment was carried out under a constant wind speed condition 1 0 0 3 m s maintained by an electrical fan at the top boundary uranine solution 2 g l was injected through the plastic tube into the gravel 90 ml one time only after the injection the plastic tube was plugged with a plastic stopper to avoid evaporation from the drain after the experiment and documentation of vp by uranine s color the containers were tilted 45 to separate the dry loose sand from wet capillary held sand to verify the vp position for details see fig 2 in suppl mat 2 3 1 2 experiment 1b this experiment was performed to test if dissolved uranine dye visualizes the vp cz and dsl in compact materials a sandstone core and an aa concrete core 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter were placed into two pvc cups closed all around except the top boundaries to avoid evaporation from the cores sides and bottoms uranine solution 1 3 3 g l 20 30 ml for details see table 2 in suppl mat was injected into the bottom one time only of the cups making sure that it is absorbed by the sample through its bottom boundary only 2 3 1 3 experiment 1c to test if the zones are traceable under transient conditions increased water supply from below or increased potential evaporation resulting in migration of the zones experiment 1c was carried out using the same experimental settings as exp 1a using two glass containers 7 15 15 cm wind speed conditions were controlled throughout the experiment maintained by electrical fans to sustain the desired potential evaporation in both containers under wind speed of 1 0 3 m s uranine solution 2 g l was injected through the plastic tubes into the gravel 90 ml which were plugged by stoppers after the injection once the solution stopped moving upwards 7 days the two containers were treated in different ways in the first container windspeed of the fan was increased to 2 5 0 5 m s to push the vp down after the documentation of the vp by uranine s color the container was tilted 45 to verify the vp position see exp 1a for reasoning in the second container more uranine solution was injected to the bottom 120 ml 2 g l to push the vp further up after the solution stopped moving upwards after another xx days it was photo documented and the container was tilted to verify the vp position 2 3 1 4 experiment 1d to test if the technique can trace former distribution of vp cz and dsl in already dried material a sandstone core 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter was placed into an open plastic container enabling evaporation from all the sides except the bottom filled with a 2 cm layer of uranine solution at its base 2 6 g l the uranine solution moved upwards due to capillary uptake the core was periodically weighted 1 2 days and after three weeks when the material had dried no measurable change in sample weight during 24hrs occurred the sample was cut in half photo documented and subsequently the cut surface was made wet by 1 ml of distilled water to partly remobilize the precipitated uranine and in 15 min photo documented again 2 3 1 5 experiment 1e to test the uranine solution on materials with uneven capillary flow and complex vp geometry a sandstone core was used 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter with naturally developed biologically initiated rock crust consisting of hydrophobic organic matter for details see slavík et al 2017 who studied the same material on its upper base of uneven surface the core was placed into a pvc cup like in exp 1b and uranine was repeatedly added into the bottom of the cup 1 3 g l see table 3 in suppl mat a sandstone core of the same size and under the same experimental settings but without crust was used for comparison at the sandstone core s upper base a pit 20 mm deep and 30 mm in diameter was hollowed out to i enable comparison with the similar surface of the sample with the crust ii to observe dye precipitation once water reaches the surface iii to test whether the solution is moving uniformly throughout the core the weight of the cores was monitored 2 3 1 6 experiment 2 in experiment 2 we compared the effectiveness of the uranine and bb dye solutions to visualize the vp cz and dsl in sand bb dye had been already used in evaporation studies e g lehmann and or 2009 shokri et al 2009 two 400 ml glass beakers were uniformly packed with sand into one 10 ml of 1 3 g l uranine solution was injected 10 ml of 0 4 g l bb solution was injected into the other beaker concentrations of both dyes were determined from preliminary tests to ensure ideal visibility both injections were performed by a medical needle that run via the middle of the sample to the very bottom the samples were left in the laboratory environment to evaporate for 18 hrs after the experiment and documentation of vp by uranine s color the containers were tilted 45 to verify the vp position see exp 1a for reasoning 2 3 2 experiments with uranine powder 2 3 2 1 experiment 3a the laboratory experiment 3a was testing uranine powder to visualize the vp cz and dsl zones in sandstone a sandstone core 50 mm thick 70 mm in diameter was placed into an open plastic container filled with 2 cm of water at its base after 5 min the core was taken out of the water and uranine powder was dusted onto the sandstone core s surface using a makeup brush after 2 min it was photo documented 2 3 2 2 experiment 3b in the field holes were drilled 80 mm diameter 60 mm depth with a core drill bit into the natural sandstone body perpendicular to the rock surface in various directions from vertical to horizontal drilling was done without the use of water or air flushing to avoid wetting or drying of the environment drilling took several tens of seconds and care was taken not to heat the drill bit considerably to avoid evaporation once the drilling was finished uranine powder was immediately applied onto the sides of the drilled hole and onto the surrounding surface of the sandstone by dusting the powder using a makeup brush after 5 min it was photo documented 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiments with uranine dye solution in the evaporation experiments we injected uranine solution into the bottom of both loose and compact materials and let the solution evaporate in porous media in all cases we observed after several hours days that the uranine solution forms two differently colored zones in porous media 1 a yellow color zone and 2 a distinctive dark orange zone fig 1 the yellow color zone 1 was colored by the solution and therefore represents the volume where uranine was carried by liquid water this flow is presumably due to capillary forces and hereafter we call 1 the capillary zone cz on the contrary the dark orange color 2 is a consequence of increased uranine concentration käss 1998 which can only be explained by evaporation within the media if the solution in the cz was adsorbed to the material s particles we would see a gradual color change as adsorption increases with solution concentration appelo and postma 2013 therefore the increased uranine concentration clearly indicates evaporation within the porous material the vaporization plane vp dividing the cz below from the dry surface layer dsl above fig 1 we hence state that the yellow color zone represents the cz the dark orange zone stands for the vp and the non colored area points to the dsl where water moves in the form of vapor only and thus not transporting any dye to further prove that the yellow zone is equivalent to the cz and the non colored zone equivalent to the dsl we checked the presence of water cohesion forces by tilting the glass container after experiment exp 2 with sand at an angle of 45 the particles above the vp were loose and separated from the rest of the material fig 2 this demonstrated the lack of cohesion forces in the dsl as capillary menisci were not present in the dry medium note that the described drying process change in vp location is slow and that any measurable change takes hours therefore seconds long tilting of the container does not change the location of the vp to further identify the differences between the three zones we used a microscope below the vp the particles appeared shiny as water formed very thin films fig 2b at the vp one could distinguish some particles being covered with uranine solution films of a dark orange color fig 2c above the vp the sand particles appeared dim and dry partly covered with what appears to be fines disintegrated from the particles fig 2d the spatial distribution of the dark orange zone and the yellow zone can change over time which could be due to e g an increased water supply below the vp or an increased potential evaporation above the vp there are two basic scenarios either the vp moves toward the surface progresses fig 3 a or it retreats into the material fig 3b in the first scenario the observed color correctly reflects the current situation as the uranine solution moves to the previously dry not colored portions and the former dark orange zone of the vp dissolves into the advancing capillary solution still remnants of the former vp may be visible in the cz especially if the former vp was stabilized for a longer time in the second case when the cz shrinks and the dsl expands into the region formerly occupied by cz the dark orange zone either thickens and or several dark orange strips are formed below the former vp fig 3b in this case the actual vp is represented by the lowest dark orange strip while the other dark orange strips are remnants of the retreating vp this was tested by tilting the samples to summarize uranine can partly overprint previous stages of moisture distribution however in the case of drying it is necessary to interpret the dark orange zone in the context of its former positions and the change of conditions uranine solution can thus reveal some information about the evolution of the moisture system whether the cz was retreating or progressing towards the surface in all the cases presented above the cz was observed while the sample was still wet see table 2 in suppl mat in some cases it can be advantageous to observe the results of the experiment after a complete drying of the sample so that the cz and vp are not present in the sample anymore the former spatial distributions of the cz and vp can still be imprinted into the material in particular clear visualization of the former cz and vp occurs if the vp is present at a constant depth for a relatively long time this is the case documented in fig 4 a where the entire sandstone core was initially wet through its bottom with uranine solution subsequently it was allowed to evaporate in an open environment until it became completely dry until the weight of the sample was in steady state and then was cut in half because of the high initial saturation of the sample and the relatively fast evaporation the vp was thus at the very surface of the sample during most of the drying process and hence the imprinting of the cz yellow zone and the vp dark orange zone close to the surface however when the vp changed its position relatively quickly its imprinting into the material was not apparent the inside of the core in fig 4a or was limited variously colored zone between the former and current vps in fig 3b when using a material with some precipitated uranine already present the observations should also be interpreted with caution as this influences the resulting color this is visible from fig 4b where after wetting the cut dry surface with drops of distilled water a new spatially limited area of capillary water was established as the distilled water was spreading sideways and thus dissolving the precipitated uranine in the material along the way the boundaries of the wet zone continuously changed its color from yellow to light orange therefore only the border of the area of this water spread was forming a distinctive light orange line even though evaporation must have taken place from the entire area wetted by the distilled water see fig 4b we tested whether it is possible to visualize the vp in the special case of a sandstone core with a hydrophobic layer uranine visualized that the hydrophobic layer at the top of the core a few mm thick slavík et al 2017 hindered the upward movement of the solution so that the capillary flow was not permitted to reach the very top of the core resulting in an uneven geometry of the vp fig 5 a in comparison in the same sandstone material except without the hydrophobic layer the vp was smooth and uniform fig 5b thanks to the knowledge of the current thickness of the cz as indicated by the orange color one can calculate the water content of the wet part of the sample which otherwise would not be possible fig 6 for further details see tables 3 and 4 in suppl mat therefore uranine visualization of the vp is effective even in materials where the vp has an intricate geometry e g heterogeneous materials fractured zones materials with hydrophobic portions etc the concentration of uranine in all the previously described experiments was between 1 3 and 3 0 g l depending on the color of the porous material used ideally the concentration should be kept low because of the possible clogging of pores by precipitated dye however it needs to be high enough so that its yellow color will be detectable on the material 3 2 comparison of uranine and bb solutions we injected bb solution into the bottom of the glass containers filled with dry sand and allowed the material to become wet at a certain level as the solution was moving upwards it started to evaporate subsequently we compared bb s behavior with the behavior of uranine despite performed under the same conditions the amounts of solutions injected the sand used and the same experimental procedures including limited packing of the material the height of the colored zones was not identical uranine colored the sand up to 8 cm in high while bb only up to 7 5 cm high over the same time period fig 7 more importantly we observed that bb does not exactly visualize the wetting front as wet parts were visually detectable above the bb line unlike with uranine similar behaviors have been reported by several studies that used bb as a tracer where the dye patterns did not exactly match the wetting front during infiltration flury and flühler 1995 devitt and smith 2002 kasteel et al 2002 this can be explained by stronger retardation of the bb therefore even though bb can be successfully used as a tracer in evaporation drying experiments when the material is saturated and let to dry i e when the vp is receding it is not always able to indicate the current wetting front and vp 3 3 experiments with uranine powder uranine can be used in the form of a dry red powder to visualize the dsl and cz after dusting it onto the surface of a porous material with the dsl and cz present two different color zones can be recognized 1 a dark orange zone and 2 a red color zone fig 8 the dark orange zone 1 is the result of dissolution of the originally dry red powder into pore water and the red color zone 2 indicates that no dissolution of the dry red powder occurs as the material remains dry in this area fig 8a b therefore the spatial distribution of the colors describes the spatial distribution of moisture within the porous media the dark orange zone represents the cz whereas the red color zone represents the dsl unlike the uranine solution application dusting with uranine powder does not explicitly highlight the vp the vp can only be assumed at the border between the two differently colored parts fig 8a b representing the cz and dsl unlike with the use of uranine solution the powder visualizes a single time frame and therefore does not allow one to study the moisture system s history thus it is not possible to distinguish whether the vp is retreating or if it is progressing towards the surface in fact there might be no vp at all in the case that the wetting front is progressing or when there is a lack of potential evaporation at the surface the change in color due to dissolution took 2 5 min according to the moisture content and or the thickness of the powder layer applied for the correct use of the uranine powder dusting method the spread of the powder must be uniform to reach quite a constant thickness otherwise there is a risk that the powder will not dissolve uniformly and thus an apparent but false dry area will be observed fig 8c 3 4 method utilization and comparison with other methods in the laboratory the use of uranine is applicable in almost any conceivable flow and evaporation experiments the decision whether to use it in the solution or powder form depends on the purpose of the experiment the advantage of using a solution is its ability to visualize the flow history as the dye is already present in the transported liquid and zones locations changes can be photo documented repeatedly for long time periods in addition to that if the solution transport throughout the media is well photo documented the water flow velocity is easily computable and any possible preferential flow can be detected this utilization is based on the properties that uranine has in common with other dyes used in the vadose zone e g bb rhodamine b or pyranine flury and wai 2003 gaspar 1987 wilson et al 2016 we would like to underscore the use of uranine dye solution for visualization of evaporation and its ability to rapidly reflect the dynamics of the water system however there are cases when it is not convenient or advisable to use uranine solution perhaps the most significant disadvantage of the use of uranine solution is in the study of evaporation in the field which has limited applicability as the solution needs to be added to the environment this changes the hydraulic field and is also demanding of time as the evaporation processes might be relatively slow other drawbacks of using solution are the possible clogging of the pores and possible density changes due to different concentrations of the original liquid in the pore space and injected into the solution another disadvantage of uranine application is its property to photodegrade käss 1998 gaigalas et al 2004 with a photodecomposition decay coefficient k 9 5 10 2 3 9 10 1 under sunny conditions dimensionless for details see review by smart and laidlaw 1977 therefore it is essential to prevent or minimize the exposure of uranine to light during experiments the use of the powder can overcome some of the drawbacks of using uranine solution as it can be applied without altering the hydraulic field and its use is relatively quick when the powder is used it is sufficient to dust it onto the surface and within minutes the color zones are displayed the use of powder is especially practical in the field where it can effectively visualize the dsl and cz however repeated use of uranine powder is not possible in situ in drilled or burrowed holes if the holes are not sealed by a material with similar properties between readings because the open hole affects the evaporation rate and therefore repeated readings of the vp depth would be different from ambient conditions we suggest using uranine dye on all ranges of evaporation experiments from the mm to m scale uranine solution can be especially practical to use in wetting evaporation experiments as it indicates the current wetting front and forms a distinctive visualization of the vp the use of uranine solution to visualize preferential pathways in the field is a well known and widespread practice wilson et al 2016 however we are not aware of any study using uranine to visualize sub surface evaporation from cracks or other preferential pathways we believe that the use of uranine offers a simple method for such studies and possibly enables differentiation between evaporation and transpiration as plant roots uptake the uranine solution palmquist 1939 and thus not causing a higher concentration of uranine in the soil the powder use can find applications in studies focused on near sub surface water movements in rock outcrops buildings and sculptures made of porous rocks when we compare the use of uranine to visualize sub surface evaporation dynamics with other methods we find that even though they are often more precise they are also more expensive and not so easily accessible for details see table 1 in suppl mat this is the case for nuclear magnetic resonance x ray tomography neutron radiography confocal microscopy and gamma ray densitometry these methods are also not possible to use effectively in the field easily employable and inexpensive methods such as the electrical resistivity tomography the heat based methods and tensiometry are less precise overall in comparison with other methods the use of uranine dye is both an easy to use and cost effective 140 usd per kg method with a fair resolution note that the electrical resistivity tomography at this research stage remains to be the only inexpensive and non destructive method which is relevant when working on heritage sites or protected areas of rock outcrops mol and viles 2013 3 5 need for future development when using uranine to visualize evaporation one can only observe a 2d view of the moisture distribution at the surface in order to gain knowledge about the insides of the material destructive approach digging drilling excavation is needed for both the solution and the powder methods figs 4 and 8b c this hinders the wider use of uranine in studying moisture at protected natural rock outcrops or in building structures and statues where any destructive approach is not acceptable here we presented the visualization of the vp in the 80 mm wide burrowed drilled holes and so far we are limited by the hole being sufficiently wide to ensure a clear view of the line between the cz and dsl therefore significant progress in miniaturization of this invasive method is needed concerning the use of uranine solution we observed that if the vp is fixed for a relatively long time precipitation of uranine occurs even though we did not observe any role of this clogging upon the evaporation rate we believe that more research is needed to quantify this in relationship to the water flow dynamics here we have presented experiments conducted in porous materials with the porosity of sand and thus another area that requires further research is the use of uranine in evaporation studies within materials of different pore sizes such as clays or gravels additionally we suggest conducting more research on the role of uranine solution concentration on evaporation rates as well as a study comparing the use of uranine to other commonly used dyes not mentioned in this paper such as rhodamine b or pyranine 4 conclusion this paper has presented several examples where uranine dye was used to visualize the vaporization plane capillary zone and the dry surface layer the uranine solution visualizes the vaporization plane by forming a distinctive dark orange zone caused by evaporation of the pore water and hence increased uranine concentration the use of uranine also enables one to distinguish the zones of vapor and capillary flow thanks either to the visualization of the vaporization plane by the uranine solution or by application of the uranine powder on porous materials when compared to the brilliant blue dye uranine solution has lower retardation and better visualizes both the capillary zone and the vaporization plane thus it should be the dye of choice for all kinds of evaporation experiments uranine dye can find use in various laboratory evaporation experiments and field studies of sub surface evaporation from both soil and rock outcrops even though this method is destructive in compact materials if miniaturized it might be used to detect the vaporization plane and the salt enriched zone in cultural heritage sites overall the presented

7007,flood coincidence risk analysis is of great significance for reservoir operation and flood control traditional research only focuses on the coincidence of flood peak actually when half or more than half of flood hydrographs of two rivers are overlapping the flood event should be defined as flood coincidence thus during the flood coincidence analysis the whole hydrograph information should be considered this study proposes a flood hydrograph coincidence analysis method in which flood magnitudes of two flood hydrographs and flood interval time are taken as three reference variables the pearson type iii distribution and the mixed von mises distribution were selected as the marginal distributions for flood magnitudes and flood interval time respectively then three dimensional copula functions were used to establish the joint distribution of these variables selecting the upper yangtze river in china as a study the characteristics of flood interval time were analyzed and the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrograph for different return periods were calculated results showed that the selected marginal and joint distributions fitted the observed flood data well for floods occurring in the jinsha river min river and jialing river the coincidence probabilities between any of those rivers were higher the coincidence probabilities between the wu river and the other three rivers mentioned above were lower the calculated coincidence probabilities by the proposed method were compared with those by the traditional statistical method results indicated that those values were nearly the same and the proposed method reflected the actual coincidence situation keywords flood hydrograph coincidence joint distribution flood magnitudes flood interval time the upper yangtze river 1 introduction flood events have become more and more frequent and continue to affect more people worldwide than any other natural hazard blöschl et al 2017 they destroy houses and buildings and carry soil away from valuable farmland they also lead to the loss of life and property therefore it is valuable to investigate the characteristics of floods especially nowadays that climate change and global warming is a worldwide problem and has a serious impact on the global hydrological cycle at various spatial and temporal scales labat et al 2004 one of the serious consequences of climate change is more frequent hydrological extreme events such as floods dankers and feyen 2008 river flooding is mainly caused by the coincidence of high flood peaks and large flood volumes the coincidence of flood flows of the mainstream and its tributaries may determine peak flow chen et al 2012 therefore it is important to assess the coincidence risk of flood on the mainstream and its tributaries for example in 1954 the entire yangtze river basin suffered from tremendous flooding and the floods of the jinsha min and jialing rivers had occurred simultaneously many times which led to loss of life property and agricultural productivity at present the problem of flood coincidence is mainly studied by two approaches one is the traditional method by counting the flood coincidence events from the observed data series and calculating their corresponding probabilities xiao 2001 guo et al 2011 dai et al 2012 this is called statistical analysis method in this study however the traditional approach only focuses on historical floods and it cannot be used to calculate the coincidence probability for t year design floods occurring in the river basins with the increase of cascade reservoirs the demand for flood information also increases and the traditional method cannot provide adequate information in order to analyze t year design floods the other method based on the joint distribution function was introduced for calculating the coincidence probabilities prohaska et al 2008 2010 prohaska et al 2008 2010 2012 used a two dimensional normal distribution to calculate the coincidence probability of a t year design flood however the normal distribution was required as the marginal distribution for the two components of the two dimensional model in general the flood magnitude does not follow the normal distribution copula function provides an alternative method for establishing the joint distribution dupuis 2007 the advantages of using copulas to model joint distributions are 1 flexibility in choosing arbitrary marginal and structure of dependence 2 extension to more than two variables and 3 separate analysis of marginal distributions and dependence structure salvadori et al 2007 serinaldi et al 2009 in recent years copulas have been widely used for multivariate hydrologic analyses for example they have been used for drought frequency analysis kao and govindaraju 2010 song and singh 2010a b chen et al 2013a xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2017 montaseri et al 2018 flood frequency analysis favre et al 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 chen et al 2010 2013b reddy et al 2012 bezak et al 2014 sraj et al 2015 guo et al 2018 lilienthal et al 2018 rainfall frequency analysis ashkar and aucoin 2011 zhang and singh 2007a and multivariate simulation aghakouchak et al 2010a b bačová mitková and halmová 2014 chen et al 2015b 2016 papaioannou et al 2016 poduje and haberlandt 2017 copula functions have also been used to analyze flood coincidence events for example klein et al 2010 and schulte and schumann 2016 used copulas to analyze the coincidence of flood volumes however these researchers considered only flood volumes and neglected flood occurrence times actually the flood coincidence is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of large floods on different rivers therefore the flood occurrence time is an important factor for analyzing flood coincidence chen et al 2012 and zhang et al 2013 used copulas to analyze the flood coincidence by considering the flood magnitude and occurrence time simultaneously however this work neglected the whole flood hydrograph information of a flood event and only the occurrence time of flood peak was considered sometimes the flood peaks in two or more rivers do not occur on the same day or in the same period but most of the flood hydrographs are concurrent for example in 1998 the entire yangtze river basin suffered from the largest flood since 1954 the flood was caused by continuous high rainstorm which led to the rapid increase of flood magnitudes the flood event continued for more than two months and the flood peak occurred eight times because of the long duration and multiple consecutive peaks in a flood event the flood of the upper yangtze river had coincidences many times therefore the coincidence of flood peak cannot fully describe the whole information of a flood event the 1998 flood event should be considered as the coincidence of flood hydrographs in the yangtze river basin which has not been studied before for studying the flood hydrograph coincidence of rivers the flood interval times and magnitudes of two or more rivers are needed to discuss together the joint distribution of these variables was considered in this study if the interval times of the flood hydrographs in any two rivers are long enough the flood hydrograph coincidence event cannot occur on the contrary if the flood interval time is short the coincidence probabilities of the flood hydrographs are large therefore the flood hydrograph is related to the flood interval time and flood magnitudes which is a multivariate problem in this study a copula function was selected as a tool for solving the multivariate problems the objective of this study was therefore to propose a new method to estimate the probabilities of flood hydrograph coincidences the trivariate copula of flood magnitudes of two hydrographs and flood interval time was established for the flood hydrograph coincidence analysis the upper yangtze river was selected as a case study the annual maximum am 15 day flood volume was sampled from the mainstream and its tributaries in the upper yangtze river basin first the flood interval time between the two flood hydrographs was analyzed second the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities were calculated by the proposed method finally results of the proposed method and the traditional method were compared and analyzed 2 methodology 2 1 definition of flood hydrograph coincidence suppose that there are two rivers namely a and b and their flood hydrographs are shown in fig 1 let v a and v b represent the flood magnitudes or volumes of am n day hydrographs for rivers a and b respectively t 1 and t 2 are the beginning time of the flood hydrographs for rivers a and b respectively then the flood interval time between the two floods occurring in rivers a and b can be expressed as 1a t d t 2 t 1 where t d can be either greater than zero or less than zero when t d 0 the flood occurrence time of river a is earlier than that of river b and when t d 0 the flood occurrence time of river b is earlier than that of river a in this study when half or more than half of flood duration of rivers a and b each are overlapping the two flood events are defined as flood coincidence thus the flood coincidence events can be defined by the values of td when variable td is within the range described below we can define these flood events as flood hydrograph coincidences 1b t d n 2 n 2 n is even t d n 1 2 n 1 2 n is odd number the flood hydrograph coincidence is graphed in fig 1 assume that the time of a flood hydrograph a is within the range of t 1 t 1 n assuming that n is even number when the occurrence time of a flood hydrograph b belongs to the range of t 1 n 2 t 1 3n 2 or the corresponding interval time td belongs to the range of n 2 n 2 the flood hydrographs are considered as flood hydrograph coincidence the coincidence probabilities of the two flood hydrographs can be calculated based on the

function of d correlated random variables x 1 x 2 xd with their respective marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 fd xd then it is possible to write an d dimensional cumulative distribution function

and metaelliptical families have been widely used for hydrological frequency analysis the archimedeam copula family can be classified into symmetric and asymmetric ones the dependence of the symmetric archimedeam copulas is the same for all variables the dependencies of asymmetric archimedeam copula functions are different corresponding to different pairs but they can only simulate the dependencies among d 1 variables chen et al 2013 however the metaelliptical family can model arbitrary pairwise dependencies between variables though a correlation matrix kao and govindaraju 2008 within the metaelliptical family the gaussian copula is the most widely used genest et al 2006 2008 he et al 2018 hasan and preece 2017 yu 2017 gaussian copula a member of metaelliptical family can be computed and simulated easily and also be swiftly extended to arbitrary dimensions moreover it can be uniquely defined by the correlation matrix of marginal distributions salarpour et al 2016 only pairwise correlations are calculated therefore trivariate gaussian copula belonging to the metaelliptical family was used to establish the joint distribution of flood magnitudes of two rivers and flood interval time the trivariate gaussian normal copula is a distribution over the unit cube 0 1 3 it is constructed from a multivariate normal distribution over ρ 3 by using the probability integral transform for a given correlation matrix ρ 1 1 3 3 the gaussian copula with parameter matrix ρ can be written as 3 c ρ u 1 u 2 u 3 φ ρ φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 2 φ 1 u 3 where φ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution and φ ρ is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equaling the correlation matrix ρ u 1 is the cdf of flood interval time and u 2 and u 3 are the cdfs of flood magnitudes of two rivers the correlation coefficient ρ can be written as a matrix in the following 4 ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 1 ρ 3 ρ 2 ρ 3 1 where ρ 1 is the correlation between the flood interval time and the flood magnitude of the first river ρ 2 is the correlation between the flood interval time and the flood magnitude of the second river and ρ 3 is the dependence between the magnitudes of the two rivers 2 2 2 marginal distribution function of flood interval time the flood interval time can be described by the directional statistics method the flood interval time td should be converted to an angle of a circle by 5 t d t d l 1 π 0 t d 2 π where l is the range of flood interval time the von mises distribution is frequently used to describe unimodal data on the circumference of a circle when multimodal data appear on a circle a mixed von mises distribution is often used to analyze the data and its parameters are often estimated by the mle method the probability density function of the von mises distribution can be expressed as fisher 1993 6 f t d 1 2 π i 0 k exp k cos t d μ 0 t d 2 π 0 μ 2 π k 0 where i 0 k is the modified bessel function of order zero and the first kind given by 7 i 0 k 1 2 π 0 2 π exp k cos θ d θ the distribution is clustered and symmetric around μ which is a measure of the mean direction and parameter k is a measure of concentration when k 0 the von mises distribution becomes a uniform distribution the von mises distribution is only a unimodal distribution however the flood interval time series often obeys a multimodal distribution in this situation fitting the data with a mixture of n von mises distribution would be a better choice the probability density function for a mixture of n von mises distributions takes on the following form 8 f t d p i 1 n p i f t d μ i k i where p i is the mixing proportion μ i is the mean direction and k i is the concentration parameter the maximum likelihood estimation mle method was used to estimate parameters of the mixed von mises distribution the marginal distribution of the flood interval time u 1 where u 1 f t d was built using the mixed von mises distribution 2 2 3 marginal distributions of flood magnitudes for the annual maximum am flood series the pearson type iii p3 distribution has been recommended by the chinese ministry of water resources mwr 1993 as a uniform procedure for flood frequency analysis in china the probability density function of the p3 distribution can be written as 9 f x 1 β α γ α x a 0 α 1 exp x a 0 β α 0 β 0 a 0 x where xi is the flood magnitude of river i α β and a 0 are the shape scale and location parameters respectively and γ α is the gamma function the principle of maximum entropy method pome was used to estimate parameters of the p3 distribution singh 1998 used the pome to estimate parameters of the p3 distribution and demonstrated the efficiency of this method in addition pome as a parameter estimation method can be used to estimate the parameters of all distributions and was studied by singh 1998 chen et al 2017 2018 chen and singh 2017 2018 the marginal distributions of flood magnitudes u 2 and u 3 where u 2 f x 2 and u 3 f x 3 were established using p3 distribution above 2 2 4 computation of empirical probabilities in order to evaluate the performance of the marginal and joint distributions the empirical probabilities are needed the formulas of the empirical probabilities for univariate and trivariate distributions are given as follows for the univariate case the empirical probabilities were estimated for each flood variable by using the weibull plotting position formula makkonen 2008 the reason the weibull plotting was selected is that for the p iii distribution the weibull formula is an unbiased plotting position formula and would be the best selection shabri 2002 mehdi and mehdi 2011 10 f emp x i i n 1 where x i is the observed data n is the sample size and f emp x i is the empirical exceedance probability of the i th observed data xi for a multivariate case the empirical trivariate joint distribution was expressed as zhang and singh 2007a b 11 f emp x i y i z i j 1 n 1 u j 1 u i 1 u j 2 u i 2 u j 3 u i 3 0 44 n 0 12 where x i y i z i are the observed data n is the sample size and f emp x i y i z i is the empirical probability of the joint distribution 2 2 5 goodness of fit of distributions the root mean square error rmse is a frequently used measure of the difference between predicted values by a plotting position and the values of the observed data these individual differences are also called residuals and rmse serves to aggregate them into a single measure of predictive power therefore rmse was selected to evaluate the performance of the marginal and joint distributions the smaller the rmse is the better the distribution fits the rmse can be expressed as 12 rmse i 1 n f x i f emp x i 2 n for marginal distributions i 1 n c ρ u i 1 u i 2 u i 3 f emp x i y i z i 2 n for joint distributions where n is the sample size f x i and c ρ u i 1 u i 2 u i 3 are the theoretical probability of the marginal and joint distributions respectively f emp x i and f emp x i y i z i are the empirical probability of the marginal and joint distributions respectively the kolmogorov smirnov k s and the anderson darling tests were used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the marginal distributions grimaldi and serinaldi 2006a b zhang and singh 2007a b for the joint distributions the k s and cramér von mises cvm tests were employed genest et al 2006 2008 2009 2 3 estimation of flood hydrograph coincidence a methodology is presented here for calculating the flood coincidence risk as flood events are characterized by flood magnitudes and flood interval time both of the two factors should be considered according to the definition of the flood hydrograph coincidence when half or more than half of flood hydrographs of two rivers are overlapping the two flood events are defined as a flood coincidence therefore the flood magnitude and flood interval time should be considered simultaneously both flood interval time and flood magnitudes were selected as reference variables for risk analysis the mixed von mises distribution and the pearson type iii distribution were selected as the marginal distributions for the flood interval time and flood magnitude respectively 13 u 1 t f 1 t d u 2 v 1 f 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 f 3 v 2 where td represents the flood interval time v 1 and v 2 represent the flood magnitudes of the am n day hydrographs respectively u 1 t represents the cdf of variable td and u 2 v 1 and u 3 v 2 represent the cdfs of variables v 1 and v 2 respectively we can now construct the joint distribution of those three variables the joint distribution is defined as c u 1 t u 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities of the rivers were defined as 14 p f p t 1 t d t 2 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 2 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 2 v 2 v 2 p t d t 2 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 u 1 t 2 u 1 t 1 c u 1 t 2 u 2 v 1 c u 1 t 2 u 3 v 2 c u 1 t 1 u 2 v 1 c u 1 t 1 u 3 v 2 c u 1 t 2 u 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 c u 1 t 1 u 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 where p f represents the risk of flood hydrograph coincidence t 1 and t 2 represent the lower and upper limits of flood interval time respectively c represents the joint distribution function of variables and can be calculated by eq 3 3 study area the upper reach of the yangtze river was selected as a case study a schematic of the regional main rivers and gauging stations is shown in fig 2 the reason for choosing the yangtze river is that it comprises a complex of tributaries and these tributaries are distributed in different areas for example the min river and the jialing river are the sinistral tributaries and the wu river is the dextral tributaries chen et al 2013b 2015a it is of great importance to study this river zhang et al 2015 in the upper yangtze river floods often cause considerable destruction of property and loss of life among the most recent major flood events are those of 1954 1961 1966 1998 2010 and 2016 for example in 2016 the entire yangtze river basin suffered from tremendous flooding which led to the number of affected people as about 60 74 million and the economic loss of 146 9 billion chinese yuan the flood was caused by unusually high precipitation between june and august and summer is the main flooding season because of the heavy monsoon rainfall chen et al 2012 2016 the jinsha river min river jialing river and wu river were studied in this paper some basic features of the investigated data are listed in table 1 the drainage area of the upper yangtze river is very large the duration of the flood is long and usually can last for more than 15 days thus the am 15 day flood hydrograph was sampled and is discussed hereafter spearman s rho correlation coefficients were used to describe the correlation of flood magnitudes between rivers in the yangtze river basin and results are shown in table 2 it is seen from that the correlation of the jinsha river and the min river is the largest and the dependence of the min river and the wu river is the smallest the correlation of the jinsha river and the jialing river is also smaller only 0 02 but the correlation of the jialing river and the min river with a value of 0 25 is significant the correlations described here are to demonstrate that flood magnitudes of those two rivers are dependent with each other and the joint distribution cannot be established using the independent model therefore the copula function was used hereafter for the coincidence analysis 4 results and discussions 4 1 estimation of joint distribution the parameters of marginal distributions of flood interval time and magnitudes were estimated as shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively the empirical frequencies of the marginal distributions were calculated by eq 10 the theoretical probabilities of the mixture von mises and p3 distribution were calculated by eqs 8 and 9 respectively the fitting curves of the marginal distributions are shown in figs 3 and 5 respectively in order to compare the fitting results more comprehensively the q q plot quantile quantile plot was used for the observed data as shown in figs 4 and 6 respectively it is seen from the figures that the marginal distributions fitted the empirical distributions well in addition the performance of the marginal distributions was evaluated by the rmse values and the kolmogorov smirnov and anderson darling tests the goodness of fit measure results of the marginal distributions are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively results indicate that the hypothesis that the flood interval time and magnitudes respectively obey the mixture von mises and p3 distributions is not rejected the parameter matrix ρ of the three dimension gaussian copula was estimated using the linear correlation coefficient and the estimated parameters are given in table 5 the theoretical probabilities and the empirical probabilities were calculated by eqs 3 and 11 respectively these probabilities are shown in fig 7 which indicates that the theoretical curves fitted the empirical probabilities well the rmse values k s and cramér von mises tests were also used to identify the copula function and results are given in table 5 as well since the rmse values rmse are small enough the gaussian copula distribution can be used to construct the joint distributions according to the results of the k s p value and cramér von mises tests p value the hypothesis that the joint distributions follow the gaussian copula function is not rejected 4 2 analysis of flood hydrograph coincidences this study focused on the 15 day flood hydrograph between any of the two rivers in the study area because of the flood coincidence related to the flood interval time the flood interval time was selected as reference variable for flood coincidence analysis first the characteristic of flood interval time was studied in this paper second based on this information the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs were calculated and analyzed 4 2 1 flood hydrograph coincidence considering only flood interval time 4 2 1 1 flood hydrograph coincidence analysis considering only the flood interval time based on the proposed method the flood interval time was calculated before analyzing the flood coincidence the mixed von mises distribution was used to fit the flood interval time and the fitting results are shown in figs 3 and 4 for the am 15 day flood hydrograph the flood events were considered as flood hydrograph coincidence when their corresponding flood interval times were within the range of 8 8 the coincidence probabilities for any of the two rivers in the upper yangtze river basin are shown in table 6 it is seen from the table that the coincidence probability of the jinsha and min river reached 30 the coincidence probability of the jinsha and jialing river reached 26 79 and the coincidence probability of the min and jialing river reached 20 87 these coincidence probabilities are significant the main reasons for the higher probability are summarized as follows a the distance between these rivers is short b they are located on the sinistral bank and have similar climatic factors c floods are mainly formed by rainfall in the yangtze river and the min river and jialing river belong to the same rainfall zones and d the occurrence times of large floods are generally in the same time period namely july and august on the contrary the coincidence probabilities between the wu river and other three rivers are lower which were 7 29 10 78 and 8 08 respectively the main reason for the lower probability are summarized as follows a the distance between the wu river and other three rivers is far b they belong to different rainfall zones and in a normal year rainfall on the sinistral and dextral banks of the yangtze river does not happen simultaneously and c the occurrence times of flood events are different for the flood coincidence events the order of the flood in any of the two rivers can be discussed using the proposed method according to the definition of the flood coincidence when their corresponding flood interval times are within the range of 0 8 the flood occurring in river a is earlier than that of river b on the contrary when their corresponding flood interval times are within the range of 8 0 the flood occurring in river a is later than that of river b for example the flood coincidence probability of the min river and the jinsha river was 30 and the probability that the flood of the min river occurred earlier than that of the jinsha river was about 23 when only the flood occurrence time was taken into account the flood coincidence probabilities for any other two rivers can be seen directly from table 6 4 2 1 2 comparison with the traditional method based on observed data the number of flood coincidence events was accounted for and results are shown in fig 8 the coincidence probability between two rivers was also calculated using the proposed method and the calculated results are given in fig 8 as well it is seen that based on the observed data the number of the flood coincidence events for the jinsha and min rivers was 22 and the calculated value by the proposed method was 23 for the jinsha river and the jialing river the observed and calculated values were 18 and 17 respectively for the min river and the jialing river the observed and calculated values were 15 and 13 respectively since the wu river is on the dextral bank of the yangtze river the number of the flood coincidences for the wu river and any other three rivers were less based on the observed data the number of the flood coincidences for the wu river and other three rivers were 8 5 and 1 respectively and the calculated values based on the proposed model were 5 6 and 5 respectively the deviation between the proposed method and the traditional method for the wu river and jialing river had a maximum value of 4 the main reasons are as follows a the natural flow was applied for analyzing flood coincidence events since reservoirs have been built the observed data from the gauging stations were affected by the reservoir operations the release flow after the reservoir operation is needed to return to the natural flow in this process the transformation error cannot be avoided b there is an error when fitting the observed data c the length of the observed data of those two rivers is relatively short and d the rmse value of distribution is smaller but the rmse values in the range of 8 8 are bigger although there is some deviation in this study the analysis results and the proposed method are still reliable 4 2 2 flood hydrograph coincidence analysis considering both the flood interval time and flood magnitudes there are some dependences among the flood magnitudes of any of the two rivers and flood interval time in the upper yangtze river and its tributaries according to the copula method we can establish the joint distribution of the flood magnitudes of any of the two rivers and the flood interval time the coincidence probabilities of t year design flood for any of the two rivers were calculated by eq 14 and results are listed in table 7 when the return period t was decreasing the coincidence probabilities were increasing therefore the results are feasible from this point of view for example if the return periods for any of the two rivers are the same with a value of 1000 years the hydrograph coincidence probability of the 1000 year design flood for the jinsha river and the min river is 9 10 6 if the flood hydrographs on the two rivers are independent of each other considering the flood interval time of those rivers the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities should be expressed by 15 p f u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 u t d where u 1 v 1 and u 2 v 2 are the exceedance probabilities for a given flood magnitude v 1 and v 2 respectively and u t d is the probability of t d t d 8 8 when we analyzed the coincidence probability of two 1000 year design flood hydrographs the coincidence probability should be p f 0 001 0 001 u t d 3 1 0 7 because there is a correlation between the flood hydrograph of the jinsha river and the min river the calculated results should be within the range of 3 10 7 3 10 4 the calculated result of the proposed method was 9 10 6 and within this range therefore the calculated result is reasonable for the 20 year 10 year and 5 year floods in the min river and the jialing river their hydrograph coincidence probabilities were 1 11 10 3 3 61 10 3 and 1 84 10 2 respectively if their flood hydrographs are independent their coincidence probabilities should be 5 22 10 4 2 09 10 3 and 8 35 10 3 respectively these probabilities are much smaller than the values calculated by the proposed method this is because that the correlation between the min river and jialing river is large as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficient was 0 28 thus the dependences among the three variables cannot be neglected during the flood hydrograph coincidence analysis if the correlation of rivers were not considered the estimated flood hydrograph coincidence risk would be smaller and incorrect these independent models given in eq 15 cannot correctly evaluate the risk of flood hydrograph coincidence and would underestimate the risk therefore the correlation of rivers must be considered for the analysis of flood hydrograph coincidence table 7 gives only the coincidence probabilities of flood design hydrographs with the same return periods actually the two hydrographs with different return periods can also be calculated for example the coincidence probabilities of a 10 year design flood hydrograph of the jinsha river and a 5 year design flood hydrograph of the jialing river is 5 63 10 3 for the 1000 year design flood hydrograph of the jinsha river and a 100 year design flood hydrograph of the jialing river the coincidence probability is 3 3 10 6 4 3 discussion flood coincidence risk analysis is of great importance for reservoir operation and flood control according to the coincidence results of flood hydrograph in the upper yangtze river this study can provide some very useful information for reservoir operation when the flood hydrographs of two rivers occur simultaneously the reservoir located on this river can store excess water for reducing the inflow of the three gorges reservoir tgr this measure can reduce the flood control pressure for the downstream area of tgr these reservoirs include the xiluodu reservoir and xiangjiaba reservoir on the jinsha river the pubugou reservoir on the min river the tingzikou reservoir on the jialing river and the goupitan reservoir on the wu river for example if the flood hydrographs of the jinsha and min river occur simultaneously the pubugou reservoir can co operate with the tgr to storage the excess flood for the xiluodu and xiangjiaba reservoirs they can also store the excess flood for reducing the inflow of the tgr therefore the study of flood hydrograph coincidence not only analyzes flood characteristics but also provides some information for multi reservoir cooperation 5 conclusions this study proposes a new method to estimate the probabilities of flood hydrograph coincidences the trivariate copula of flood interval time and flood magnitudes was established for analysis of the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs the upper yangtze river was selected as a case study the annual maximum am 15 day flood volume was sampled from the mainstream and its tributaries in the upper yangtze river basin the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs were calculated by the proposed method the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 flood coincidences studied by many researchers mainly focused on flood peak and neglected the flood hydrograph information sometimes the flood peaks in two or more rivers do not occur on the same day or in the same period but most of the flood hydrographs are concurrent these situations should also be considered for flood risk analysis by establishing the marginal distributions and the joint distributions the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs were calculated and analyzed results show that the marginal and joint distribution can fit the flood data well comparing the calculated coincidence probabilities with observed ones results indicate that those values are nearly the same and the proposed method can reflect the actual coincidences the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities of any return period can be obtained directly by the proposed method in which the dependences among flood magnitudes and interval time is considered if correlations of this kind are not considered the estimated flood coincidence risk can be smaller and incorrect therefore the correlation should not be neglected in flood coincidence risk analysis the proposed method was used to analyze flood hydrograph coincidence for the upper yangtze river results demonstrate that only considering the flood interval time the coincidence probability of the jinsha and min river reaches 30 the coincidence probability of the jinsha and jialing river reaches 26 79 and that of the min and jialing river reaches 20 87 on the contrary the coincidence probabilities between the wu river and other three rivers mentioned above are lower which are 7 29 10 78 and 8 08 respectively by the proposed method the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities of any return period can be obtained directly the study of flood hydrograph coincidence not only analyzes flood characteristics but also provides information for multi reservoir cooperation acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 national natural science foundation of china 51679094

7007,flood coincidence risk analysis is of great significance for reservoir operation and flood control traditional research only focuses on the coincidence of flood peak actually when half or more than half of flood hydrographs of two rivers are overlapping the flood event should be defined as flood coincidence thus during the flood coincidence analysis the whole hydrograph information should be considered this study proposes a flood hydrograph coincidence analysis method in which flood magnitudes of two flood hydrographs and flood interval time are taken as three reference variables the pearson type iii distribution and the mixed von mises distribution were selected as the marginal distributions for flood magnitudes and flood interval time respectively then three dimensional copula functions were used to establish the joint distribution of these variables selecting the upper yangtze river in china as a study the characteristics of flood interval time were analyzed and the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrograph for different return periods were calculated results showed that the selected marginal and joint distributions fitted the observed flood data well for floods occurring in the jinsha river min river and jialing river the coincidence probabilities between any of those rivers were higher the coincidence probabilities between the wu river and the other three rivers mentioned above were lower the calculated coincidence probabilities by the proposed method were compared with those by the traditional statistical method results indicated that those values were nearly the same and the proposed method reflected the actual coincidence situation keywords flood hydrograph coincidence joint distribution flood magnitudes flood interval time the upper yangtze river 1 introduction flood events have become more and more frequent and continue to affect more people worldwide than any other natural hazard blöschl et al 2017 they destroy houses and buildings and carry soil away from valuable farmland they also lead to the loss of life and property therefore it is valuable to investigate the characteristics of floods especially nowadays that climate change and global warming is a worldwide problem and has a serious impact on the global hydrological cycle at various spatial and temporal scales labat et al 2004 one of the serious consequences of climate change is more frequent hydrological extreme events such as floods dankers and feyen 2008 river flooding is mainly caused by the coincidence of high flood peaks and large flood volumes the coincidence of flood flows of the mainstream and its tributaries may determine peak flow chen et al 2012 therefore it is important to assess the coincidence risk of flood on the mainstream and its tributaries for example in 1954 the entire yangtze river basin suffered from tremendous flooding and the floods of the jinsha min and jialing rivers had occurred simultaneously many times which led to loss of life property and agricultural productivity at present the problem of flood coincidence is mainly studied by two approaches one is the traditional method by counting the flood coincidence events from the observed data series and calculating their corresponding probabilities xiao 2001 guo et al 2011 dai et al 2012 this is called statistical analysis method in this study however the traditional approach only focuses on historical floods and it cannot be used to calculate the coincidence probability for t year design floods occurring in the river basins with the increase of cascade reservoirs the demand for flood information also increases and the traditional method cannot provide adequate information in order to analyze t year design floods the other method based on the joint distribution function was introduced for calculating the coincidence probabilities prohaska et al 2008 2010 prohaska et al 2008 2010 2012 used a two dimensional normal distribution to calculate the coincidence probability of a t year design flood however the normal distribution was required as the marginal distribution for the two components of the two dimensional model in general the flood magnitude does not follow the normal distribution copula function provides an alternative method for establishing the joint distribution dupuis 2007 the advantages of using copulas to model joint distributions are 1 flexibility in choosing arbitrary marginal and structure of dependence 2 extension to more than two variables and 3 separate analysis of marginal distributions and dependence structure salvadori et al 2007 serinaldi et al 2009 in recent years copulas have been widely used for multivariate hydrologic analyses for example they have been used for drought frequency analysis kao and govindaraju 2010 song and singh 2010a b chen et al 2013a xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2017 montaseri et al 2018 flood frequency analysis favre et al 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 chen et al 2010 2013b reddy et al 2012 bezak et al 2014 sraj et al 2015 guo et al 2018 lilienthal et al 2018 rainfall frequency analysis ashkar and aucoin 2011 zhang and singh 2007a and multivariate simulation aghakouchak et al 2010a b bačová mitková and halmová 2014 chen et al 2015b 2016 papaioannou et al 2016 poduje and haberlandt 2017 copula functions have also been used to analyze flood coincidence events for example klein et al 2010 and schulte and schumann 2016 used copulas to analyze the coincidence of flood volumes however these researchers considered only flood volumes and neglected flood occurrence times actually the flood coincidence is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of large floods on different rivers therefore the flood occurrence time is an important factor for analyzing flood coincidence chen et al 2012 and zhang et al 2013 used copulas to analyze the flood coincidence by considering the flood magnitude and occurrence time simultaneously however this work neglected the whole flood hydrograph information of a flood event and only the occurrence time of flood peak was considered sometimes the flood peaks in two or more rivers do not occur on the same day or in the same period but most of the flood hydrographs are concurrent for example in 1998 the entire yangtze river basin suffered from the largest flood since 1954 the flood was caused by continuous high rainstorm which led to the rapid increase of flood magnitudes the flood event continued for more than two months and the flood peak occurred eight times because of the long duration and multiple consecutive peaks in a flood event the flood of the upper yangtze river had coincidences many times therefore the coincidence of flood peak cannot fully describe the whole information of a flood event the 1998 flood event should be considered as the coincidence of flood hydrographs in the yangtze river basin which has not been studied before for studying the flood hydrograph coincidence of rivers the flood interval times and magnitudes of two or more rivers are needed to discuss together the joint distribution of these variables was considered in this study if the interval times of the flood hydrographs in any two rivers are long enough the flood hydrograph coincidence event cannot occur on the contrary if the flood interval time is short the coincidence probabilities of the flood hydrographs are large therefore the flood hydrograph is related to the flood interval time and flood magnitudes which is a multivariate problem in this study a copula function was selected as a tool for solving the multivariate problems the objective of this study was therefore to propose a new method to estimate the probabilities of flood hydrograph coincidences the trivariate copula of flood magnitudes of two hydrographs and flood interval time was established for the flood hydrograph coincidence analysis the upper yangtze river was selected as a case study the annual maximum am 15 day flood volume was sampled from the mainstream and its tributaries in the upper yangtze river basin first the flood interval time between the two flood hydrographs was analyzed second the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities were calculated by the proposed method finally results of the proposed method and the traditional method were compared and analyzed 2 methodology 2 1 definition of flood hydrograph coincidence suppose that there are two rivers namely a and b and their flood hydrographs are shown in fig 1 let v a and v b represent the flood magnitudes or volumes of am n day hydrographs for rivers a and b respectively t 1 and t 2 are the beginning time of the flood hydrographs for rivers a and b respectively then the flood interval time between the two floods occurring in rivers a and b can be expressed as 1a t d t 2 t 1 where t d can be either greater than zero or less than zero when t d 0 the flood occurrence time of river a is earlier than that of river b and when t d 0 the flood occurrence time of river b is earlier than that of river a in this study when half or more than half of flood duration of rivers a and b each are overlapping the two flood events are defined as flood coincidence thus the flood coincidence events can be defined by the values of td when variable td is within the range described below we can define these flood events as flood hydrograph coincidences 1b t d n 2 n 2 n is even t d n 1 2 n 1 2 n is odd number the flood hydrograph coincidence is graphed in fig 1 assume that the time of a flood hydrograph a is within the range of t 1 t 1 n assuming that n is even number when the occurrence time of a flood hydrograph b belongs to the range of t 1 n 2 t 1 3n 2 or the corresponding interval time td belongs to the range of n 2 n 2 the flood hydrographs are considered as flood hydrograph coincidence the coincidence probabilities of the two flood hydrographs can be calculated based on the joint distribution f v a v b t d 2 2 establishment of trivariate joint distribution 2 2 1 copula function following sklar 1959 and nelsen 2006 if f 1 2 d x 1 x 2 xd is a multivariate distribution function of d correlated random variables x 1 x 2 xd with their respective marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 fd xd then it is possible to write an d dimensional cumulative distribution function cdf with univariate margins f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 fd xd as follows bezak et al 2017 2 f x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d c u 1 u 2 u d where fk xk uk for k 1 d with uk u 0 1 recently the archimedeam and metaelliptical families have been widely used for hydrological frequency analysis the archimedeam copula family can be classified into symmetric and asymmetric ones the dependence of the symmetric archimedeam copulas is the same for all variables the dependencies of asymmetric archimedeam copula functions are different corresponding to different pairs but they can only simulate the dependencies among d 1 variables chen et al 2013 however the metaelliptical family can model arbitrary pairwise dependencies between variables though a correlation matrix kao and govindaraju 2008 within the metaelliptical family the gaussian copula is the most widely used genest et al 2006 2008 he et al 2018 hasan and preece 2017 yu 2017 gaussian copula a member of metaelliptical family can be computed and simulated easily and also be swiftly extended to arbitrary dimensions moreover it can be uniquely defined by the correlation matrix of marginal distributions salarpour et al 2016 only pairwise correlations are calculated therefore trivariate gaussian copula belonging to the metaelliptical family was used to establish the joint distribution of flood magnitudes of two rivers and flood interval time the trivariate gaussian normal copula is a distribution over the unit cube 0 1 3 it is constructed from a multivariate normal distribution over ρ 3 by using the probability integral transform for a given correlation matrix ρ 1 1 3 3 the gaussian copula with parameter matrix ρ can be written as 3 c ρ u 1 u 2 u 3 φ ρ φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 2 φ 1 u 3 where φ 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution and φ ρ is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equaling the correlation matrix ρ u 1 is the cdf of flood interval time and u 2 and u 3 are the cdfs of flood magnitudes of two rivers the correlation coefficient ρ can be written as a matrix in the following 4 ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 1 ρ 3 ρ 2 ρ 3 1 where ρ 1 is the correlation between the flood interval time and the flood magnitude of the first river ρ 2 is the correlation between the flood interval time and the flood magnitude of the second river and ρ 3 is the dependence between the magnitudes of the two rivers 2 2 2 marginal distribution function of flood interval time the flood interval time can be described by the directional statistics method the flood interval time td should be converted to an angle of a circle by 5 t d t d l 1 π 0 t d 2 π where l is the range of flood interval time the von mises distribution is frequently used to describe unimodal data on the circumference of a circle when multimodal data appear on a circle a mixed von mises distribution is often used to analyze the data and its parameters are often estimated by the mle method the probability density function of the von mises distribution can be expressed as fisher 1993 6 f t d 1 2 π i 0 k exp k cos t d μ 0 t d 2 π 0 μ 2 π k 0 where i 0 k is the modified bessel function of order zero and the first kind given by 7 i 0 k 1 2 π 0 2 π exp k cos θ d θ the distribution is clustered and symmetric around μ which is a measure of the mean direction and parameter k is a measure of concentration when k 0 the von mises distribution becomes a uniform distribution the von mises distribution is only a unimodal distribution however the flood interval time series often obeys a multimodal distribution in this situation fitting the data with a mixture of n von mises distribution would be a better choice the probability density function for a mixture of n von mises distributions takes on the following form 8 f t d p i 1 n p i f t d μ i k i where p i is the mixing proportion μ i is the mean direction and k i is the concentration parameter the maximum likelihood estimation mle method was used to estimate parameters of the mixed von mises distribution the marginal distribution of the flood interval time u 1 where u 1 f t d was built using the mixed von mises distribution 2 2 3 marginal distributions of flood magnitudes for the annual maximum am flood series the pearson type iii p3 distribution has been recommended by the chinese ministry of water resources mwr 1993 as a uniform procedure for flood frequency analysis in china the probability density function of the p3 distribution can be written as 9 f x 1 β α γ α x a 0 α 1 exp x a 0 β α 0 β 0 a 0 x where xi is the flood magnitude of river i α β and a 0 are the shape scale and location parameters respectively and γ α is the gamma function the principle of maximum entropy method pome was used to estimate parameters of the p3 distribution singh 1998 used the pome to estimate parameters of the p3 distribution and demonstrated the efficiency of this method in addition pome as a parameter estimation method can be used to estimate the parameters of all distributions and was studied by singh 1998 chen et al 2017 2018 chen and singh 2017 2018 the marginal distributions of flood magnitudes u 2 and u 3 where u 2 f x 2 and u 3 f x 3 were established using p3 distribution above 2 2 4 computation of empirical probabilities in order to evaluate the performance of the marginal and joint distributions the empirical probabilities are needed the formulas of the empirical probabilities for univariate and trivariate distributions are given as follows for the univariate case the empirical probabilities were estimated for each flood variable by using the weibull plotting position formula makkonen 2008 the reason the weibull plotting was selected is that for the p iii distribution the weibull formula is an unbiased plotting position formula and would be the best selection shabri 2002 mehdi and mehdi 2011 10 f emp x i i n 1 where x i is the observed data n is the sample size and f emp x i is the empirical exceedance probability of the i th observed data xi for a multivariate case the empirical trivariate joint distribution was expressed as zhang and singh 2007a b 11 f emp x i y i z i j 1 n 1 u j 1 u i 1 u j 2 u i 2 u j 3 u i 3 0 44 n 0 12 where x i y i z i are the observed data n is the sample size and f emp x i y i z i is the empirical probability of the joint distribution 2 2 5 goodness of fit of distributions the root mean square error rmse is a frequently used measure of the difference between predicted values by a plotting position and the values of the observed data these individual differences are also called residuals and rmse serves to aggregate them into a single measure of predictive power therefore rmse was selected to evaluate the performance of the marginal and joint distributions the smaller the rmse is the better the distribution fits the rmse can be expressed as 12 rmse i 1 n f x i f emp x i 2 n for marginal distributions i 1 n c ρ u i 1 u i 2 u i 3 f emp x i y i z i 2 n for joint distributions where n is the sample size f x i and c ρ u i 1 u i 2 u i 3 are the theoretical probability of the marginal and joint distributions respectively f emp x i and f emp x i y i z i are the empirical probability of the marginal and joint distributions respectively the kolmogorov smirnov k s and the anderson darling tests were used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the marginal distributions grimaldi and serinaldi 2006a b zhang and singh 2007a b for the joint distributions the k s and cramér von mises cvm tests were employed genest et al 2006 2008 2009 2 3 estimation of flood hydrograph coincidence a methodology is presented here for calculating the flood coincidence risk as flood events are characterized by flood magnitudes and flood interval time both of the two factors should be considered according to the definition of the flood hydrograph coincidence when half or more than half of flood hydrographs of two rivers are overlapping the two flood events are defined as a flood coincidence therefore the flood magnitude and flood interval time should be considered simultaneously both flood interval time and flood magnitudes were selected as reference variables for risk analysis the mixed von mises distribution and the pearson type iii distribution were selected as the marginal distributions for the flood interval time and flood magnitude respectively 13 u 1 t f 1 t d u 2 v 1 f 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 f 3 v 2 where td represents the flood interval time v 1 and v 2 represent the flood magnitudes of the am n day hydrographs respectively u 1 t represents the cdf of variable td and u 2 v 1 and u 3 v 2 represent the cdfs of variables v 1 and v 2 respectively we can now construct the joint distribution of those three variables the joint distribution is defined as c u 1 t u 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities of the rivers were defined as 14 p f p t 1 t d t 2 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 2 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 2 v 2 v 2 p t d t 2 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 1 v 2 v 2 p t d t 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 u 1 t 2 u 1 t 1 c u 1 t 2 u 2 v 1 c u 1 t 2 u 3 v 2 c u 1 t 1 u 2 v 1 c u 1 t 1 u 3 v 2 c u 1 t 2 u 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 c u 1 t 1 u 2 v 1 u 3 v 2 where p f represents the risk of flood hydrograph coincidence t 1 and t 2 represent the lower and upper limits of flood interval time respectively c represents the joint distribution function of variables and can be calculated by eq 3 3 study area the upper reach of the yangtze river was selected as a case study a schematic of the regional main rivers and gauging stations is shown in fig 2 the reason for choosing the yangtze river is that it comprises a complex of tributaries and these tributaries are distributed in different areas for example the min river and the jialing river are the sinistral tributaries and the wu river is the dextral tributaries chen et al 2013b 2015a it is of great importance to study this river zhang et al 2015 in the upper yangtze river floods often cause considerable destruction of property and loss of life among the most recent major flood events are those of 1954 1961 1966 1998 2010 and 2016 for example in 2016 the entire yangtze river basin suffered from tremendous flooding which led to the number of affected people as about 60 74 million and the economic loss of 146 9 billion chinese yuan the flood was caused by unusually high precipitation between june and august and summer is the main flooding season because of the heavy monsoon rainfall chen et al 2012 2016 the jinsha river min river jialing river and wu river were studied in this paper some basic features of the investigated data are listed in table 1 the drainage area of the upper yangtze river is very large the duration of the flood is long and usually can last for more than 15 days thus the am 15 day flood hydrograph was sampled and is discussed hereafter spearman s rho correlation coefficients were used to describe the correlation of flood magnitudes between rivers in the yangtze river basin and results are shown in table 2 it is seen from that the correlation of the jinsha river and the min river is the largest and the dependence of the min river and the wu river is the smallest the correlation of the jinsha river and the jialing river is also smaller only 0 02 but the correlation of the jialing river and the min river with a value of 0 25 is significant the correlations described here are to demonstrate that flood magnitudes of those two rivers are dependent with each other and the joint distribution cannot be established using the independent model therefore the copula function was used hereafter for the coincidence analysis 4 results and discussions 4 1 estimation of joint distribution the parameters of marginal distributions of flood interval time and magnitudes were estimated as shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively the empirical frequencies of the marginal distributions were calculated by eq 10 the theoretical probabilities of the mixture von mises and p3 distribution were calculated by eqs 8 and 9 respectively the fitting curves of the marginal distributions are shown in figs 3 and 5 respectively in order to compare the fitting results more comprehensively the q q plot quantile quantile plot was used for the observed data as shown in figs 4 and 6 respectively it is seen from the figures that the marginal distributions fitted the empirical distributions well in addition the performance of the marginal distributions was evaluated by the rmse values and the kolmogorov smirnov and anderson darling tests the goodness of fit measure results of the marginal distributions are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively results indicate that the hypothesis that the flood interval time and magnitudes respectively obey the mixture von mises and p3 distributions is not rejected the parameter matrix ρ of the three dimension gaussian copula was estimated using the linear correlation coefficient and the estimated parameters are given in table 5 the theoretical probabilities and the empirical probabilities were calculated by eqs 3 and 11 respectively these probabilities are shown in fig 7 which indicates that the theoretical curves fitted the empirical probabilities well the rmse values k s and cramér von mises tests were also used to identify the copula function and results are given in table 5 as well since the rmse values rmse are small enough the gaussian copula distribution can be used to construct the joint distributions according to the results of the k s p value and cramér von mises tests p value the hypothesis that the joint distributions follow the gaussian copula function is not rejected 4 2 analysis of flood hydrograph coincidences this study focused on the 15 day flood hydrograph between any of the two rivers in the study area because of the flood coincidence related to the flood interval time the flood interval time was selected as reference variable for flood coincidence analysis first the characteristic of flood interval time was studied in this paper second based on this information the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs were calculated and analyzed 4 2 1 flood hydrograph coincidence considering only flood interval time 4 2 1 1 flood hydrograph coincidence analysis considering only the flood interval time based on the proposed method the flood interval time was calculated before analyzing the flood coincidence the mixed von mises distribution was used to fit the flood interval time and the fitting results are shown in figs 3 and 4 for the am 15 day flood hydrograph the flood events were considered as flood hydrograph coincidence when their corresponding flood interval times were within the range of 8 8 the coincidence probabilities for any of the two rivers in the upper yangtze river basin are shown in table 6 it is seen from the table that the coincidence probability of the jinsha and min river reached 30 the coincidence probability of the jinsha and jialing river reached 26 79 and the coincidence probability of the min and jialing river reached 20 87 these coincidence probabilities are significant the main reasons for the higher probability are summarized as follows a the distance between these rivers is short b they are located on the sinistral bank and have similar climatic factors c floods are mainly formed by rainfall in the yangtze river and the min river and jialing river belong to the same rainfall zones and d the occurrence times of large floods are generally in the same time period namely july and august on the contrary the coincidence probabilities between the wu river and other three rivers are lower which were 7 29 10 78 and 8 08 respectively the main reason for the lower probability are summarized as follows a the distance between the wu river and other three rivers is far b they belong to different rainfall zones and in a normal year rainfall on the sinistral and dextral banks of the yangtze river does not happen simultaneously and c the occurrence times of flood events are different for the flood coincidence events the order of the flood in any of the two rivers can be discussed using the proposed method according to the definition of the flood coincidence when their corresponding flood interval times are within the range of 0 8 the flood occurring in river a is earlier than that of river b on the contrary when their corresponding flood interval times are within the range of 8 0 the flood occurring in river a is later than that of river b for example the flood coincidence probability of the min river and the jinsha river was 30 and the probability that the flood of the min river occurred earlier than that of the jinsha river was about 23 when only the flood occurrence time was taken into account the flood coincidence probabilities for any other two rivers can be seen directly from table 6 4 2 1 2 comparison with the traditional method based on observed data the number of flood coincidence events was accounted for and results are shown in fig 8 the coincidence probability between two rivers was also calculated using the proposed method and the calculated results are given in fig 8 as well it is seen that based on the observed data the number of the flood coincidence events for the jinsha and min rivers was 22 and the calculated value by the proposed method was 23 for the jinsha river and the jialing river the observed and calculated values were 18 and 17 respectively for the min river and the jialing river the observed and calculated values were 15 and 13 respectively since the wu river is on the dextral bank of the yangtze river the number of the flood coincidences for the wu river and any other three rivers were less based on the observed data the number of the flood coincidences for the wu river and other three rivers were 8 5 and 1 respectively and the calculated values based on the proposed model were 5 6 and 5 respectively the deviation between the proposed method and the traditional method for the wu river and jialing river had a maximum value of 4 the main reasons are as follows a the natural flow was applied for analyzing flood coincidence events since reservoirs have been built the observed data from the gauging stations were affected by the reservoir operations the release flow after the reservoir operation is needed to return to the natural flow in this process the transformation error cannot be avoided b there is an error when fitting the observed data c the length of the observed data of those two rivers is relatively short and d the rmse value of distribution is smaller but the rmse values in the range of 8 8 are bigger although there is some deviation in this study the analysis results and the proposed method are still reliable 4 2 2 flood hydrograph coincidence analysis considering both the flood interval time and flood magnitudes there are some dependences among the flood magnitudes of any of the two rivers and flood interval time in the upper yangtze river and its tributaries according to the copula method we can establish the joint distribution of the flood magnitudes of any of the two rivers and the flood interval time the coincidence probabilities of t year design flood for any of the two rivers were calculated by eq 14 and results are listed in table 7 when the return period t was decreasing the coincidence probabilities were increasing therefore the results are feasible from this point of view for example if the return periods for any of the two rivers are the same with a value of 1000 years the hydrograph coincidence probability of the 1000 year design flood for the jinsha river and the min river is 9 10 6 if the flood hydrographs on the two rivers are independent of each other considering the flood interval time of those rivers the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities should be expressed by 15 p f u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 u t d where u 1 v 1 and u 2 v 2 are the exceedance probabilities for a given flood magnitude v 1 and v 2 respectively and u t d is the probability of t d t d 8 8 when we analyzed the coincidence probability of two 1000 year design flood hydrographs the coincidence probability should be p f 0 001 0 001 u t d 3 1 0 7 because there is a correlation between the flood hydrograph of the jinsha river and the min river the calculated results should be within the range of 3 10 7 3 10 4 the calculated result of the proposed method was 9 10 6 and within this range therefore the calculated result is reasonable for the 20 year 10 year and 5 year floods in the min river and the jialing river their hydrograph coincidence probabilities were 1 11 10 3 3 61 10 3 and 1 84 10 2 respectively if their flood hydrographs are independent their coincidence probabilities should be 5 22 10 4 2 09 10 3 and 8 35 10 3 respectively these probabilities are much smaller than the values calculated by the proposed method this is because that the correlation between the min river and jialing river is large as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficient was 0 28 thus the dependences among the three variables cannot be neglected during the flood hydrograph coincidence analysis if the correlation of rivers were not considered the estimated flood hydrograph coincidence risk would be smaller and incorrect these independent models given in eq 15 cannot correctly evaluate the risk of flood hydrograph coincidence and would underestimate the risk therefore the correlation of rivers must be considered for the analysis of flood hydrograph coincidence table 7 gives only the coincidence probabilities of flood design hydrographs with the same return periods actually the two hydrographs with different return periods can also be calculated for example the coincidence probabilities of a 10 year design flood hydrograph of the jinsha river and a 5 year design flood hydrograph of the jialing river is 5 63 10 3 for the 1000 year design flood hydrograph of the jinsha river and a 100 year design flood hydrograph of the jialing river the coincidence probability is 3 3 10 6 4 3 discussion flood coincidence risk analysis is of great importance for reservoir operation and flood control according to the coincidence results of flood hydrograph in the upper yangtze river this study can provide some very useful information for reservoir operation when the flood hydrographs of two rivers occur simultaneously the reservoir located on this river can store excess water for reducing the inflow of the three gorges reservoir tgr this measure can reduce the flood control pressure for the downstream area of tgr these reservoirs include the xiluodu reservoir and xiangjiaba reservoir on the jinsha river the pubugou reservoir on the min river the tingzikou reservoir on the jialing river and the goupitan reservoir on the wu river for example if the flood hydrographs of the jinsha and min river occur simultaneously the pubugou reservoir can co operate with the tgr to storage the excess flood for the xiluodu and xiangjiaba reservoirs they can also store the excess flood for reducing the inflow of the tgr therefore the study of flood hydrograph coincidence not only analyzes flood characteristics but also provides some information for multi reservoir cooperation 5 conclusions this study proposes a new method to estimate the probabilities of flood hydrograph coincidences the trivariate copula of flood interval time and flood magnitudes was established for analysis of the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs the upper yangtze river was selected as a case study the annual maximum am 15 day flood volume was sampled from the mainstream and its tributaries in the upper yangtze river basin the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs were calculated by the proposed method the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 flood coincidences studied by many researchers mainly focused on flood peak and neglected the flood hydrograph information sometimes the flood peaks in two or more rivers do not occur on the same day or in the same period but most of the flood hydrographs are concurrent these situations should also be considered for flood risk analysis by establishing the marginal distributions and the joint distributions the coincidence probabilities of flood hydrographs were calculated and analyzed results show that the marginal and joint distribution can fit the flood data well comparing the calculated coincidence probabilities with observed ones results indicate that those values are nearly the same and the proposed method can reflect the actual coincidences the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities of any return period can be obtained directly by the proposed method in which the dependences among flood magnitudes and interval time is considered if correlations of this kind are not considered the estimated flood coincidence risk can be smaller and incorrect therefore the correlation should not be neglected in flood coincidence risk analysis the proposed method was used to analyze flood hydrograph coincidence for the upper yangtze river results demonstrate that only considering the flood interval time the coincidence probability of the jinsha and min river reaches 30 the coincidence probability of the jinsha and jialing river reaches 26 79 and that of the min and jialing river reaches 20 87 on the contrary the coincidence probabilities between the wu river and other three rivers mentioned above are lower which are 7 29 10 78 and 8 08 respectively by the proposed method the flood hydrograph coincidence probabilities of any return period can be obtained directly the study of flood hydrograph coincidence not only analyzes flood characteristics but also provides information for multi reservoir cooperation acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 national natural science foundation of china 51679094

7008,whether the spatial variation and influence of rock fragment contents rfcs on soil hydraulic parameters shps should be jointly considered in the soil water simulation have been less investigated in previous studies in this study we tested whether considering these factors were necessary in the soil water simulation on a representative stony soil hillslope located in taihu lake basin china five schemes of shps in hydrus 3d model were established they were i multirfhet spatially varied shps extracted from durner s multimodal retention function based on the observed soil water retention

rosrfchet spatially varied shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs results indicated when the spatial variation and influence of rfcs on shps were both considered multirfhet and rosrfchet acceptable accuracies nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse 0 58 for multirfhet and 0 17 for rosrfchet were achieved in simulating the soil water storage sws variation since the multirfhet required the calibration by the observed soil water retention data rosrfchet was a good alternative in the simulation on the contrary the shps acquired without considering neither the rfcs nor the spatial variation yielded unacceptable simulation results nse general 0 this demonstrated that spatial variation and influence of rfcs on shps should be included in the sws simulation on this stony soil hillslope although it had limited effect in subsurface flow simulation keywords rock fragment stony soils dual porosity hydrus 3d model 1 introduction with superiority in time and economic costs and in deriving continuous hydrological processes over space and time three dimensional 3d physically based modeling has been widely adopted in hydrological researches e g herbst et al 2006 vereecken et

affecting the model simulation e g model structure input parameters and dependent variables have also been investigated and determined fu et al 2015 vereecken et al 2015 among these sources uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters shps was recognized as one of the major obstacles for achieving the optimal simulations chirico et al 2007 baroni et al 2017 traditional approaches in acquiring the shps include direct measurement and indirect estimation direct laboratory or field measurements of shps are costly and time consuming thus restrict the availability of high spatial resolution shp data for model simulation chirico et al 2007 vereecken et al 2010 thereby indirect methods especially the pedotransfer functions ptfs have been developed to estimate the shps from easily measurable soil physical and chemical properties wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 for example the hypres wösten et al 1999 and vereecken vereecken et al 1989 however previous studies have demonstrated that applying existing ptfs always introduced substantial uncertainty when they were used outside the datasets they developed chirico et al 2007 liao et al 2014 reliable approaches are needed to cost effectively estimate the shps in areas with different geological pedological and meteorological backgrounds for example the stony soil areas stony soils are soils containing over 30 in volume of rock fragments soil particles 2 mm as defined by tetegan et al 2011 due to soil development processes and actions of mankind as well as soil erosion stony soils are worldwide distributed for example in western europe stony soils account for 30 of soil resources and account for 60 in the mediterranean region poesen and lavee 1994 in china mountains composed of stony soils account for 18 of the national area ma and shao 2008 therefore comprehensively and accurately revealing the hydrological processes of upstream stony soil hillslope is critical for the protection of the downstream ecosystems rock fragment content rfc affected the shps and consequently affected the hydrological processes in stony soils cousin et al 2003 ma et al 2010 coppola et al 2013 as rock fragments could reduce pore volume available for containing water and increase the tortuosity of water flow the water content and hydraulic conductivities of stony soils generally decreased with increasing rfc baetens et al 2009 hlaváčiková et al 2016 rock fragments have an obvious influence on the stony soils water retention especially in the low suction region ravina and magier 1984 baetens et al 2009 the widely used van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 cannot characterize the low suction region of the soil water retention characteristic of stony soils vereecken et al 2010 assouline and or 2013 recently several dual porosity functions have been developed for structured soils šimůnek et al 2003 arora et al 2011 and can be used to derive shps of stony soils ma and shao 2008 the one proposed by durner 1994 multimodal retention function abbreviated as multirf in this study is promising since it requires less parameters that are relatively easy to be obtained šimůnek et al 2003 parajuli et al 2017 besides as existing ptfs did not consider the rfc empirical functions to modify the ptfs have been built to predict the shps in stony soils based on the shps of fine earth and rfcs bouwer and rice 1984 brakensiek et al 1986 however doubts emerged with the applications of these empirical functions e g ma et al 2010 novák et al 2011 investigations are still needed to verify performances of the dual porosity functions and modified ptfs in the soil water simulations for stony soils the spatial variations of shps also affect the simulation of soil water dynamics the shps show spatial variations at different scales and detailed characterizing these variations is a crucial challenge over large areas herbst et al 2006 baroni et al 2017 as the discrepancy between scales at which shps were measured or predicted and at which hydrological model ran the upscaling procedure was inevitable and thus the uncertainty of spatial variations of shps generated vereecken et al 2007 to date many scientists have focused on revealing the uncertainty of spatial variation of shps on simulating hydrological process e g herbst et al 2006 fiori and russo 2007 for example sciuto and diekkrüger 2010 investigated the impacts of the shps spatial variations on the water balance and found the spatial resolution has a larger impact on the soil moisture than the aggregation of the soil properties baroni et al 2017 quantified the impact of different types of uncertainties that arose from the unresolved soil spatial variability on simulated hydrological states and fluxes however previous studies were generally conducted through virtual experiment only a few of them based on exact characterizing the actual spatial variation of shps of the study regions e g jin et al 2015 fang et al 2016 the objectives of this study were to test the hypotheses that considering i the influence of rock fragments on shps and ii the spatial variation of shps improve the soil water simulation on the stony soil hillslope specifically the multirf was adopted to extract the shps by fitting observed soil water retention data we also investigated whether adjusting the rosetta derived shps by rfc and adopting spatial variation of shps would be necessary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study hillslope this study was conducted on a hillslope 31 21 n 119 03 e has an area of about 0 4 ha in the hilly

de lehaie the data of both the tea and bamboo hillslopes were used to assess the relationships between the shps and soil terrain properties however soil water dynamics were only simulated on the tea

installed to monitor the soil water content and matrix potential respectively the averages of the measured values of the three ec 5 and mps 6 sensors were respectively used as the final soil water content and matrix potential data at each site and depth the rock fragments on this hillslope are usually small 1 cm in diameter and comparatively homogenously distributed in the soil therefore although these sensors were installed in the fine textured soils their measuring volumes included both the fine textured soils and rock fragments the final measured data by these sensors could reflect the soil water content and matrix potential of the stony soils sensors were calibrated for each soil depth and before installation before installing these sensors soil profiles were opened and three soil horizons a b and c were observed within each profile liao et al 2016 after all sensors were installed the profiles were carefully backfilled a weather station decagon devices inc pullman wa usa was established to record the meteorological data fig 1 two rain gauges were equipped respectively above and below the canopy of the tea plant to monitor the gross rainfall and throughfall on the tea hillslope fig 5 as the ratio about 75 of the monitored throughfall to the gross rainfall 1821 mm during from 29 march 2016 to 28 march 2017 was in the ranges of previous studies which with approximate leaf area index e g siles et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 thus we think the monitored throughfall by one rain gauge was acceptable all measurements soil water content matrix potentials and meteorological data were collected every 5 min the daily averaged of these measured data were used in the following analyses soil samples at 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm depth intervals were collected using a hand auger at 39 sites on the tea hillslope and at the four automatic monitoring sites on the bamboo hillslope fig 1 three subsamples were collected for each depth interval at each site and then fully mixed these samples were air dried weighted ground and sieved through a 2 mm polyethylene sieve particles 2 mm were weighed to determine the rfc soils passed through the 2 mm polyethylene sieve were used to determine the contents of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm as well as the contents of soil organic matter som liao et al 2016 in addition the depths to bedrock db of all 43 sites 39 on the tea hillslope 4 on the bamboo hillslope were determined when taking soil samples using a hand auger fig 1 a high resolution 1 m digital elevation model dem was derived from a 1 1000 contour map terrain attributes including elevation slope plane curvature plc profile curvature prc and topographic wetness index twi were determined from this dem in arcgis 10 0 esri redlands ca the statistics of terrain attributes and soil properties of the tea hillslope are shown in table 1 2 3 the predictions of shps scheme i spatially varied shps extracted from the multirf based on the observed soil water retention data multirfhet twelve groups of soil water retention data were derived in this study fig 2 they were tg01 10 10 indicated the 10 cm depth tg02 10 tg02 30 tg03 10 tg04 10 tg04 30 bf01 10 bf02 10 bf02 30 bf03 30 bf04 10 bf04 30 the sensors at tg01 30 tg03 30 bf01 30 and bf03 10 were damaged in this study the multirf proposed by durner 1994 was adopted to fit the observed soil water retention data using the nonlinear least squares optimization program retc van genuchten et al 1991 the multirf was constructed by a linear superposition of subcurves of the van genuchten van genuchten 1980 type 1 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r i 1 k w i 1 1 α i h n i m i where se is the effective water content h m is the pressure head and θr m3 m 3 and θs m3 m 3 is the residual and saturated water contents respectively k is the number of subsystems that form the total pore size distribution and wi is empirical weighing coefficients for the subsystem i and αi m 1 ni mi 1 1 ni are the van genuchten curve shape parameters of the subsystem i in this study the complicated pore structures of stony soils can be generally characterized by two pore systems fine earth and rock fragments seven shps were then obtained the residual and saturated soil water content θr and θs the van genuchten curve shape parameters of the fine earth of soil αm and nm the volumetric fraction of the rock fragments wf and the van genuchten curve shape parameters of the rock fragments αf and nf the wf was derived by transforming the rfc from gravimetric to volumetric as the αm nm and αf were found approximate among these twelve observation data they were set identically as the averaged values with αm 3 00 m 1 nm 1 48 and αf 1 00 m 1 respectively to reduce the prediction uncertainty and complexity this disposal was reasonable and feasibility as the soil texture were homogenous on the tea hillslope which meant the soil water retention characteristics of the fine textured soils were approximate to some degree the stepwise multiple linear regression was used in statistical product and service solutions 19 0 spss 19 0 spss inc il usa to construct the regression model between the shps θr θs nf and the soil properties rfc sand silt clay om and topographic attributes slope elevation twi plc prc db the significance entry level for an independent variable was set as p 0 15 the soil properties on different sampling sites were interpolated with a resolution of 1 m using ordinary kriging in arcgis 10 0 the spatial distributions of shps at 10 and 30 cm depths were obtained based on the regression models and the maps of soil properties and terrain attributes the k means clustering algorithm jain 2010 was applied with the maps of shps as inputs to classify the shps at 10 and 30 cm depths in the k means clustering algorithm cluster centers are initially chosen randomly from the set of input observation vectors i e the vectors of shps an iterative approach was applied by minimizing the objective function ξ k between the input vector and the centroid vector 2 ξ k i 1 k j 1 n i x ij u i 2 where k is the number of clusters determined a priori ni is the number of data objects belonging to the cluster i x ij is the vector of attributes of the j data object of the cluster i ui is the mean value of the attributes for the data objects in the cluster i and describes the euclidean distance between two data objects in this study hartigan and wong s 1979 algorithm was used to run the k means clustering and the elbow criterion twarakavi et al 2010 was used to estimate an optimal number of clusters in our study 12 clusters were sufficient to present the spatial variance of the shps at both 10 and 30 cm depths as adding one additional cluster did not add sufficient information based on the elbow criterion twarakavi et al 2010 the attributes at the cluster centroid were determined as the shps on the corresponding cluster in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks were measured on each cluster at 10 and 30 cm depths by tension infiltrometer scheme ii spatially uniformed shps derived from rosetta roshom the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 was adopted to predict the shps at the 39 soil sampling sites based on the contents of sand silt and clay the maps of rosetta derived shps were generated by spatial interpolating the shps at these 39 sites using ordinary kriging in arcgis 10 0 the arithmetic means of these maps of shps were used as the spatially uniformed shps in this scheme scheme iii spatially varied shps derived from rosetta roshet the maps of rosetta derived shps in scheme ii were used to obtain the 12 clusters using the k means clustering for 10 and 30 cm depths as the shps predicted by rosetta were more spatially homogenous than those fitted by multirf 12 clusters were adequate to capture the spatial variation the attributes at the cluster centroid were determined as the shps on the corresponding cluster scheme iv spatial uniformed shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs rosrfchom the influences of rfc were considered by adjusting the maps of rosetta predicted shps θr θs and ks in scheme ii by empirical functions proposed by ravina and magier 1984 and brakensiek et al 1986 denoted as rosetta rfc 3 θ t 1 w f θ m w f θ f 4 k st 1 w f k sm where θt m3 m 3 and kst m d 1 are the adjusted residual saturated soil water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the stony soils respectively wf is the volumetric fraction of the rock fragments m3 m 3 θm m3 m 3 and ksm m d 1 are the rosetta predicted residual saturated soil water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix part respectively θf m3 m 3 is the residual saturated soil water contents of the rock fragments set as 0 00 and 0 25 m3 m 3 respectively then the maps of shps derived from rosetta and adjusted with rfc were generated for different depths on the study hillslope the arithmetic means of these maps were used as the spatially uniformed shps in this scheme scheme v spatial varied shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs rosrfchet the maps of shps derived from rosetta rfc in scheme iv were used to obtain the 12 clusters using the k means clustering for 10 and 30 cm depths twelve clusters were also adequate to capture the spatial variation of the shps derived from rosetta rfc the attributes at the cluster centroid were determined as the shps on the corresponding cluster 2 4 the simulation by hydrus 3d model the hydrus 3d model šimůnek et al 2012 was used in this study the model domain was generated by importing the x y z values respectively convert from longitude altitude and elevation of the surface 20 cm depths and bedrock layer on the study hillslope the z values of the 20 cm depth and bedrock layers were derived by subtracting 20 cm and the db from the surface dem respectively two sub layers were then obtained the topsoil 0 20 cm representing horizon a and the subsoil from 20 cm to the bedrock representing the horizon b the average spacing between nodes in horizontal direction was set as 0 4 m and the total finite elements mesh contained 86 850 nodes arranged in ten mesh layers and resulting in 151 524 3 d elements in the form of triangular prisms the topsoil consisted of the top six mesh layers whereas the remaining lower four mesh layers belonged to the subsoil and the lowest one mesh layer represented the bedrock the spatial distributions of shps at 10 and 30 cm depths in these five schemes were used to represent the shps in the topsoil and subsoil in the scheme of multirfhet the composite hydraulic conductivity function proposed by durner et al 1999 was used to describe the soil hydraulic conductivities in hydrus 3d model the bedrock shps were assumed as θr 0 05 m3 m 3 θs 0 30 m3 m 3 α 1 02 m 1 n 6 05 ks 0 08 m d 1 and l 0 5 referred to heilweil and solomon 2004 and katsura et al 2006 with the similar lithology an atmospheric boundary condition with daily throughfall and potential evapotranspiration etp was imposed on the surface of the model domain fig 1 the upslope boundary and the left side of the domain were treated as zero flux boundaries since the upslope was the top of the mountain and the left side had a trench opened to separate the hillslope with the surrounding area fig 1 a seepage face boundary condition was assigned to the downslope boundary near a pond and the right side of the domain isolated by a trench fig 1 this allowed water to leave the domain through sections of the boundary that were above the field capacity pressure head 0 18 m a free drainage boundary condition was specified for the bottom the bedrock as the groundwater table was deep 8 m and the bedrock had high water permeability fig 1 initial conditions were defined as a soil water content of 0 25 m3 m 3 the etp was determined as crop reference evapotranspiration et0 multiplied by a crop coefficient of the tea assumed to a constant equal to 1 according to stephens and carr 1991 and kigalu 2007 the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was applied to calculate et0 based on the monitored daily maximum minimum and mean temperature the etp was partitioned into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp based on beer s law ritchie 1972 5 e p et p e k l a i 6 t p et p e p where k is the extinction coefficient and lai is the leaf area index in this study k was set to 0 55 according to white et al 2000 the lai was assumed to be a constant equal to 6 through the little varied monthly observed data by lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa the tp was employed for simulating the root water uptake according to the s shaped water stress response function van genuchten 1987 the soil water potential at which root water uptake was reduced by 50 p50 in the water stress response function was usually set from 10 m to 50 m however as high rfc in the soils a lower p50 value 8 m was suggested by zhu et al 2009 the exponent in the water stress response function p was set to the recommended value of 3 the root length density was measured using the standard auger method smit et al 2013 total 600 days of observed data from 7 august 2015 to 28 march 2017 were used to run the model the first 234 days were set as spin up period and the simulation results of the latter 365 days from 29 march 2016 to 28 march 2017 were validated by the observed data as no finite element node was exactly corresponded to the depth 10 or 30 cm where soil water content was measured the soil water storage sws calculated by soil water contents at 10 and 30 cm depths at these four sites were used to validate the simulated sws the root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to evaluate the simulation accuracies 3 results 3 1 the fitted and predicted shps the multirf well fitted the observed soil water retention data at different depths and sites on the study tea hillslope and the adjacent bamboo hillslope table 2 fig 2 the rmse values were generally below 0 02 m3 m 3 and the nse values were generally above 0 90 table 2 therefore the shps derived from the multirf were treated as the observed shps the fitted θr θs wf and nf varied at different depths and sites table 2 implying that large spatial variances of shps on this study hillslope for example the largest wf was found at tg02 30 0 60 m3 m 3 while the smallest wf was found at bf02 10 0 18 m3 m 3 the largest nf value was 22 29 at bf02 10 while the smallest nf was 1 48 and at bf04 30 the shps derived from rosetta and rosetta rfc had relatively poor performances in fitting the observed soil water retention data fig 2 the rmse values were generally above 0 04 m3 m 3 and the nse values were generally below zero however shps derived from rosetta rfc were generally better than those derived from rosetta fig 2 the θr values derived from rosetta and rosetta rfc were similar ranging from 0 06 to 0 08 m3 m 3 and generally smaller than these derived from the multirf ranging from 0 08 to 0 22 m3 m 3 however the θs predicted by rosetta rfc were closer to those derived from the multirf than those predicted by rosetta fig 2 smaller curvatures were found for the soil water retention curves derived from rosetta and rosetta rfc than those derived from the multirf fig 2 the mean α was 0 53 m 1 for both the rosetta and rosetta rfc and ranged from 0 44 to 0 69 m 1 and the mean n was 1 66 and ranged from 1 62 to 1 70 3 2 the spatial distributions of shps local ptfs were developed by constructing the regression models between the shps derived from the multirf θr θs and nf and the soil properties and topographic attributes table 3 these regression equations well predicted the θr θs and nf with both the determination coefficient r2 and nse above 0 68 the independent variables for predicting the θr were silt clay and elevation for predicting the θs were sand clay som rfc and db and for predicting the nf were twi clay and som based on these regression models maps of shps derived from the multirf were generated fig 3 great spatial variation can be observed for these shps the spatial mean θr values were both 0 11 m3 m 3 at 10 and 30 cm depths while the coefficients of variations cvs of the θr were 28 1 and 18 6 at these two depths respectively the spatial means of θs was 0 43 m3 m 3and 0 42 m3 m 3 at 10 and 30 cm depths respectively while the cvs for these two depths were 15 3 and 17 5 the spatial means of wf at 10 and 30 cm depths were 0 34 m3 m 3 and 0 36 m3 m 3 respectively while the cvs for these two depths were 18 15 and 24 77 the nf value was generally smaller than 8 00 the cvs of nf were 46 0 and 32 1 at 10 and 30 cm depths respectively the shps of multirfhet in different clusters were shown in table 4 and the spatial distributions of the clusters were shown in fig 4 a and b the 12 clustered shps for roshet and rosrfchet and their spatial distributions at different depths were shown in table 5 and fig 4c f negligible distinctions of the shps among clusters and at different depths were observed for roshet table 5 the θr θs and n were about 0 07 m3 m 3 0 45 m3 m 3 and 1 67 respectively in different clusters and at these two depths the mean α was 0 52 m 1 and ranged from 0 46 to 0 61 m 1 at 10 cm depth and was 0 50 m 1 and ranged from 0 45 to 0 59 m 1 at 30 cm depth at both depths the mean ks was 0 21 m d 1 and ranged from 0 18 to 0 24 m d 1 however for rosrfchet obvious differences of some shps were observed among different clusters and at different depths table 5 the θs ranged from 0 33 to 0 40 m3 m 3 and from 0 30 to 0 40 m3 m 3 at 10 and 30 cm depths respectively while the ks ranged from 0 10 to 0 20 m d 1 and from 0 13 to 0 15 m d 1 3 3 the simulated sws performances of hydrus 3d based on shps derived from these five schemes varied on this study hillslope fig 5 the simulated swss by multirfhet were close to the observations at these four sites with the nse 0 58 and the rmse 16 50 mm both of the roshom and roshet generally overestimated the swss especially during the wet period the nse values of these two schemes at sites tg01 tg02 and tg04 were 0 the swss at sites tg01 and tg04 were overestimated by the rosrfchom and rosrfchet while were well simulated at sites tg02 and tg03 low nse values 0 30 were found for both rosrfchom and rosrfchet at sites tg01 and tg04 at site tg03 the nse values of these two schemes were 0 80 while at tg02 the nse value was 0 60 for rosrfchet but 0 for rosrfchom 3 4 the accumulative boundary flux slight differences were also found among the accumulative boundary fluxes derived from different schemes fig 6 for all five schemes the accumulative free drainage fluxes and evapotranspiration rates were two major sink terms of the water balance which individually accounted for about 50 of the accumulative precipitation 1821 00 mm the smallest accumulative drainage flux 896 00 mm and the largest accumulative evapotranspiration 860 00 mm were found for the roshom and roshet while the accumulative drainage flux around 928 00 mm and evapotranspiration around 840 00 mm were approximate for rosrfchom rosrfchet and multirfhet 4 discussion 4 1 the influences of rfc the shps were well extracted by the multirf fig 2 and the observed swss were well simulated fig 5 by adopting multirfhet in hydrus 3d model as comprehensively considering the pore systems of stony soils the fine earth and the rock fragments the multirf can better characterize the shps in low suction region than the traditional single porosity models durner 1994 šimůnek et al 2003 dettmann et al 2014 fig 2 as shps in multirfhet were calibrated by the observed soil water retention data performances in simulating the sws were obviously better than the other schemes fig 5 however since the soil at tg03 was fine textured wf 0 25 m3 m 3 sand 9 0 the nse of multirfhet in simulating sws was lower than those of rosrfchom and rosrfchet fig 5 this indicated that the multirf may overestimate the influence of rfc for the fine textured soils when the rosetta predicted shps were adjusted by rfc improved accuracies were observed in fitting the soil water retention data and simulating the sws variations figs 2 and 5 for all the depths and sites rmse values in fitting the soil water retention data decreased and nse values increased when adopting the shps derived from rosetta rfc the changed rmse and nse values were significantly correlated with wf p 0 05 which indicated the improved performance by considering rfc were more obvious for the coarse textured soils this is due to that rosetta was constructed without considering the rock fragments thus shps of stony soils were overestimated when predicted by the rosetta after adjusted by rfc based on the empirical equations the predicted shps θr θs and ks decreased and thus the accuracies in fitting the soil water retention data were improved additionally comparing the roshom with rosrfchom and roshet with rosrfchet the nse values all improved and the rmse values all reduced fig 5 however for tg03 with relative fine textured soils the improvements of prediction accuracies were less obvious coppola et al 2013 also demonstrated that better simulations of the average evolution of water content were achieved when the ptfs predicted shps were scaled for stoniness therefore it is necessary to incorporate the rfc as a predictor for the construction of ptfs and the measurements of rfc should be included in the soil survey especially in hilly areas baetens et al 2009 even so imperfect performances were still observed when using the rosetta predicted and rfc adjusted shps as inputs to fit the soil water retention data and simulate the sws variations figs 2 and 5 for example the nse values in simulating the sws variations were below 0 25 at tg01 and tg04 for rosrfchom and rosrfchet fig 5 this indicated that the empirical functions proposed by ravina and magier 1984 and brakensiek et al 1986 may not be effective in all cases which has also been reported by novák et al 2011 and coppola et al 2013 when using the rosetta rfc to fit the soil water retention curves influences of rfc on the curve parameters α and n were not considered this can be a reason for the imperfect performances of rosetta rfc baetens et al 2009 ma et al 2010 4 2 the influence of spatial variation of shps adopting the spatial varied shps can improve the simulation of the sws only when the influence of rfc was considered rosrfchom and rosrfchet fig 5 since the spatial variations of shps predicted by rosetta was low table 5 this improvement was not presented between roshet and roshom fig 5 however comparing the simulation accuracies by rosrfchet with those by rosrfchom obvious improvements were observed at sites tg01 and tg02 reduce the rmse by 47 9 and 48 6 respectively this can be attributed to distinct differences between the shps derived from rosrfchet and rosrfchom at these two sites and the shps derived from rosrfchet may be closer to the actual shps for tg03 as the shps derived from rosrfchom and rosrfchet may be both close to the real values the simulation accuracies were both high for tg04 as the shps derived from rosrfchom and rosrfchet both deviated from the actual shps the simulation accuracies were both low numerous previous studies have emphasized the influence of the spatial variation of shps on simulated hydrological states and fluxes e g herbst et al 2006 fiori and russo 2007 fang et al 2016 baroni et al 2017 many approaches have been proposed to precisely scale and characterize the spatial variation of shps e g vereecken et al 2007 fang et al 2016 however only a few studies were devoted to improving the simulation accuracy by exactly characterizing the actual spatial variation of shps based on the existing scaling approaches for example jin et al 2015 found the simulation by soil and water assessment tool with spatially clustered shps had more accurate performance than using the average soil properties fang et al 2016 employed the information entropy concept for the scale dependent parameterization of soil hydraulic conductivity and found it can improve model performance both in terms of soil water content and runoff simulation the optimal performances of multirfhet fig 5 demonstrated that the k means clustering was appropriate to cluster and simplify the shps spatial distribution this could significantly reduce the simulation times that were needed to run the model with finer resolution of shps the k means clustering has been also used in previous studies for example twarakavi et al 2010 used k means clustering algorithm to determine the optimal number of soil hydraulic classes zhang et al 2016 proposed a combination of k means clustering of kriged soil texture data ptfs and model inversion to parameterize the vadose zone hydraulic properties 4 3 determining proper approaches when the observed soil water retention data were available the multirfhet which calibrated by the observed data and considered the spatial variation of shps yielded the best simulation of sws variations fig 5 when the observed soil water retention data were unavailable the rosrfchet which both considered the influence of rfc on shps and the spatial variation of shps also had acceptable accuracies in sws simulation and could be an alternative fig 5 relative to the multirfhet the rosrfchet is more time efficient and economical as it is not necessary to be calibrated by observed soil water retention data as the influence of rfc on shps and the spatial variation of shps were neither considered in roshom roshet and rosrfchom these schemes were incapable to simulate the sws variations on the stony soil hillslope nse values generally 0 fig 5 considering the spatial variation of shps and effects of rfc on shps had limited influences on the subsurface flow simulation although they had critical influences on sws simulation this was consistent with the study by coppola et al 2013 the reasons for comparatively small differences of the boundary fluxes among different schemes maybe i the sws differences of different schemes only accounted for a small portion of the soil water balance comparing with the precipitation and evapotranspiration on this study hillslope and ii the spatial variations of shps were not strong enough to show obvious effect on the subsurface flow simulation since the study hillslope was comparatively small 0 4 ha therefore in other areas with low precipitation or evapotranspiration but high spatial variations of shps the changed sws may account for large portion in the water balance and thus spatial variation and rfc may show strong effects on subsurface flow simulation to improve the simulation of subsurface flow accurate inputs of precipitation and evapotranspiration can be more important precipitation is usually monitored by raingauge for the evapotranspiration numerous studies have reported its significant influences on the hydrological modelling e g ivanov et al 2010 vereecken et al 2015 feng et al 2017 to acquire the accurate evapotranspiration parameters we should either equip with more advanced monitoring systems e g eddy covariance flux tower and large aperture scintillometer or use more advanced algorithms data to calculate estimate the evapotranspiration rate wang and dickinson 2012 5 conclusions in this study whether considering rfc and spatial variation of shps were necessary in simulating soil water dynamics were investigated on a representative stony soil hillslope results shown adopting the multirfhet which was calibrated by the observed soil water retention data and considered the spatial variation of shps achieved the best accuracies in simulating the sws for this high rfc soil however rosrfchet which considered the influence of rfc and the spatial variation of shps could be the most proper choice in sws simulation since it did not need the observed soil water retention data and calibration the roshom roshet and rosrfchom which did not both consider the influence of rfc on shps and the spatial variation of shps yield unacceptable simulations this demonstrated that for stony soils rfc impacts and spatial variation of shps should be both considered in simulating soil water dynamics however this consideration had limited effects in subsurface flow simulation findings of this study will facilitate the hydrological modeling in stony soils and supplement the knowledge of the influences of rfc meanwhile the results of this study will also be beneficial for the agricultural development and management in the hilly areas in which large amount of rock fragments were always contained in the soils acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the national natural

7008,whether the spatial variation and influence of rock fragment contents rfcs on soil hydraulic parameters shps should be jointly considered in the soil water simulation have been less investigated in previous studies in this study we tested whether considering these factors were necessary in the soil water simulation on a representative stony soil hillslope located in taihu lake basin china five schemes of shps in hydrus 3d model were established they were i multirfhet spatially varied shps extracted from durner s multimodal retention function based on the observed soil water retention data ii roshom spatially uniformed shps derived from rosetta iii roshet spatially varied shps derived from rosetta iv rosrfchom spatially uniformed shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs v rosrfchet spatially varied shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs results indicated when the spatial variation and influence of rfcs on shps were both considered multirfhet and rosrfchet acceptable accuracies nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse 0 58 for multirfhet and 0 17 for rosrfchet were achieved in simulating the soil water storage sws variation since the multirfhet required the calibration by the observed soil water retention data rosrfchet was a good alternative in the simulation on the contrary the shps acquired without considering neither the rfcs nor the spatial variation yielded unacceptable simulation results nse general 0 this demonstrated that spatial variation and influence of rfcs on shps should be included in the sws simulation on this stony soil hillslope although it had limited effect in subsurface flow simulation keywords rock fragment stony soils dual porosity hydrus 3d model 1 introduction with superiority in time and economic costs and in deriving continuous hydrological processes over space and time three dimensional 3d physically based modeling has been widely adopted in hydrological researches e g herbst et al 2006 vereecken et al 2015 baroni et al 2017 numerous models have been developed and applied in different areas over the last decades e g fiori and russo 2007 fang et al 2016 baroni et al 2017 sources of uncertainties affecting the model simulation e g model structure input parameters and dependent variables have also been investigated and determined fu et al 2015 vereecken et al 2015 among these sources uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters shps was recognized as one of the major obstacles for achieving the optimal simulations chirico et al 2007 baroni et al 2017 traditional approaches in acquiring the shps include direct measurement and indirect estimation direct laboratory or field measurements of shps are costly and time consuming thus restrict the availability of high spatial resolution shp data for model simulation chirico et al 2007 vereecken et al 2010 thereby indirect methods especially the pedotransfer functions ptfs have been developed to estimate the shps from easily measurable soil physical and chemical properties wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 for example the hypres wösten et al 1999 and vereecken vereecken et al 1989 however previous studies have demonstrated that applying existing ptfs always introduced substantial uncertainty when they were used outside the datasets they developed chirico et al 2007 liao et al 2014 reliable approaches are needed to cost effectively estimate the shps in areas with different geological pedological and meteorological backgrounds for example the stony soil areas stony soils are soils containing over 30 in volume of rock fragments soil particles 2 mm as defined by tetegan et al 2011 due to soil development processes and actions of mankind as well as soil erosion stony soils are worldwide distributed for example in western europe stony soils account for 30 of soil resources and account for 60 in the mediterranean region poesen and lavee 1994 in china mountains composed of stony soils account for 18 of the national area ma and shao 2008 therefore comprehensively and accurately revealing the hydrological processes of upstream stony soil hillslope is critical for the protection of the downstream ecosystems rock fragment content rfc affected the shps and consequently affected the hydrological processes in stony soils cousin et al 2003 ma et al 2010 coppola et al 2013 as rock fragments could reduce pore volume available for containing water and increase the tortuosity of water flow the water content and hydraulic conductivities of stony soils generally decreased with increasing rfc baetens et al 2009 hlaváčiková et al 2016 rock fragments have an obvious influence on the stony soils water retention especially in the low suction region ravina and magier 1984 baetens et al 2009 the widely used van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 cannot characterize the low suction region of the soil water retention characteristic of stony soils vereecken et al 2010 assouline and or 2013 recently several dual porosity functions have been developed for structured soils šimůnek et al 2003 arora et al 2011 and can be used to derive shps of stony soils ma and shao 2008 the one proposed by durner 1994 multimodal retention function abbreviated as multirf in this study is promising since it requires less parameters that are relatively easy to be obtained šimůnek et al 2003 parajuli et al 2017 besides as existing ptfs did not consider the rfc empirical functions to modify the ptfs have been built to predict the shps in stony soils based on the shps of fine earth and rfcs bouwer and rice 1984 brakensiek et al 1986 however doubts emerged with the applications of these empirical functions e g ma et al 2010 novák et al 2011 investigations are still needed to verify performances of the dual porosity functions and modified ptfs in the soil water simulations for stony soils the spatial variations of shps also affect the simulation of soil water dynamics the shps show spatial variations at different scales and detailed characterizing these variations is a crucial challenge over large areas herbst et al 2006 baroni et al 2017 as the discrepancy between scales at which shps were measured or predicted and at which hydrological model ran the upscaling procedure was inevitable and thus the uncertainty of spatial variations of shps generated vereecken et al 2007 to date many scientists have focused on revealing the uncertainty of spatial variation of shps on simulating hydrological process e g herbst et al 2006 fiori and russo 2007 for example sciuto and diekkrüger 2010 investigated the impacts of the shps spatial variations on the water balance and found the spatial resolution has a larger impact on the soil moisture than the aggregation of the soil properties baroni et al 2017 quantified the impact of different types of uncertainties that arose from the unresolved soil spatial variability on simulated hydrological states and fluxes however previous studies were generally conducted through virtual experiment only a few of them based on exact characterizing the actual spatial variation of shps of the study regions e g jin et al 2015 fang et al 2016 the objectives of this study were to test the hypotheses that considering i the influence of rock fragments on shps and ii the spatial variation of shps improve the soil water simulation on the stony soil hillslope specifically the multirf was adopted to extract the shps by fitting observed soil water retention data we also investigated whether adjusting the rosetta derived shps by rfc and adopting spatial variation of shps would be necessary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study hillslope this study was conducted on a hillslope 31 21 n 119 03 e has an area of about 0 4 ha in the hilly area of taihu lake basin china fig 1 green tea camellia sinensis l o kuntze is the dominated plant on the study hillslope the adjacent hillslope is dominated by moso bamboo phyllostachysedulis carr h de lehaie the data of both the tea and bamboo hillslopes were used to assess the relationships between the shps and soil terrain properties however soil water dynamics were only simulated on the tea hillslope since a trench were opened along the boundary of tea and bamboo hillslopes to separate them into two hydrological units the downslope boundary of the tea hillslope was near a pond detailed descriptions of this study hillslope can be found in liao et al 2016 2 2 data collection automatic monitoring systems were installed at four sites on the tea hillslope tg01 tg02 tg03 and tg04 and four sites on the bamboo hillslope bf01 bf02 bf03 and bf04 fig 1 at each site and each depth 10 and 30 cm three ec 5 paired with three mps 6 sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa were circled installed to monitor the soil water content and matrix potential respectively the averages of the measured values of the three ec 5 and mps 6 sensors were respectively used as the final soil water content and matrix potential data at each site and depth the rock fragments on this hillslope are usually small 1 cm in diameter and comparatively homogenously distributed in the soil therefore although these sensors were installed in the fine textured soils their measuring volumes included both the fine textured soils and rock fragments the final measured data by these sensors could reflect the soil water content and matrix potential of the stony soils sensors were calibrated for each soil depth and before installation before installing these sensors soil profiles were opened and three soil horizons a b and c were observed within each profile liao et al 2016 after all sensors were installed the profiles were carefully backfilled a weather station decagon devices inc pullman wa usa was established to record the meteorological data fig 1 two rain gauges were equipped respectively above and below the canopy of the tea plant to monitor the gross rainfall and throughfall on the tea hillslope fig 5 as the ratio about 75 of the monitored throughfall to the gross rainfall 1821 mm during from 29 march 2016 to 28 march 2017 was in the ranges of previous studies which with approximate leaf area index e g siles et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 thus we think the monitored throughfall by one rain gauge was acceptable all measurements soil water content matrix potentials and meteorological data were collected every 5 min the daily averaged of these measured data were used in the following analyses soil samples at 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm depth intervals were collected using a hand auger at 39 sites on the tea hillslope and at the four automatic monitoring sites on the bamboo hillslope fig 1 three subsamples were collected for each depth interval at each site and then fully mixed these samples were air dried weighted ground and sieved through a 2 mm polyethylene sieve particles 2 mm were weighed to determine the rfc soils passed through the 2 mm polyethylene sieve were used to determine the contents of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm as well as the contents of soil organic matter som liao et al 2016 in addition the depths to bedrock db of all 43 sites 39 on the tea hillslope 4 on the bamboo hillslope were determined when taking soil samples using a hand auger fig 1 a high resolution 1 m digital elevation model dem was derived from a 1 1000 contour map terrain attributes including elevation slope plane curvature plc profile curvature prc and topographic wetness index twi were determined from this dem in arcgis 10 0 esri redlands ca the statistics of terrain attributes and soil properties of the tea hillslope are shown in table 1 2 3 the predictions of shps scheme i spatially varied shps extracted from the multirf based on the observed soil water retention data multirfhet twelve groups of soil water retention data were derived in this study fig 2 they were tg01 10 10 indicated the 10 cm depth tg02 10 tg02 30 tg03 10 tg04 10 tg04 30 bf01 10 bf02 10 bf02 30 bf03 30 bf04 10 bf04 30 the sensors at tg01 30 tg03 30 bf01 30 and bf03 10 were damaged in this study the multirf proposed by durner 1994 was adopted to fit the observed soil water retention data using the nonlinear least squares optimization program retc van genuchten et al 1991 the multirf was constructed by a linear superposition of subcurves of the van genuchten van genuchten 1980 type 1 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r i 1 k w i 1 1 α i h n i m i where se is the effective water content h m is the pressure head and θr m3 m 3 and θs m3 m 3 is the residual and saturated water contents respectively k is the number of subsystems that form the total pore size distribution and wi is empirical weighing coefficients for the subsystem i and αi m 1 ni mi 1 1 ni are the van genuchten curve shape parameters of the subsystem i in this study the complicated pore structures of stony soils can be generally characterized by two pore systems fine earth and rock fragments seven shps were then obtained the residual and saturated soil water content θr and θs the van genuchten curve shape parameters of the fine earth of soil αm and nm the volumetric fraction of the rock fragments wf and the van genuchten curve shape parameters of the rock fragments αf and nf the wf was derived by transforming the rfc from gravimetric to volumetric as the αm nm and αf were found approximate among these twelve observation data they were set identically as the averaged values with αm 3 00 m 1 nm 1 48 and αf 1 00 m 1 respectively to reduce the prediction uncertainty and complexity this disposal was reasonable and feasibility as the soil texture were homogenous on the tea hillslope which meant the soil water retention characteristics of the fine textured soils were approximate to some degree the stepwise multiple linear regression was used in statistical product and service solutions 19 0 spss 19 0 spss inc il usa to construct the regression model between the shps θr θs nf and the soil properties rfc sand silt clay om and topographic attributes slope elevation twi plc prc db the significance entry level for an independent variable was set as p 0 15 the soil properties on different sampling sites were interpolated with a resolution of 1 m using ordinary kriging in arcgis 10 0 the spatial distributions of shps at 10 and 30 cm depths were obtained based on the regression models and the maps of soil properties and terrain attributes the k means clustering algorithm jain 2010 was applied with the maps of shps as inputs to classify the shps at 10 and 30 cm depths in the k means clustering algorithm cluster centers are initially chosen randomly from the set of input observation vectors i e the vectors of shps an iterative approach was applied by minimizing the objective function ξ k between the input vector and the centroid vector 2 ξ k i 1 k j 1 n i x ij u i 2 where k is the number of clusters determined a priori ni is the number of data objects belonging to the cluster i x ij is the vector of attributes of the j data object of the cluster i ui is the mean value of the attributes for the data objects in the cluster i and describes the euclidean distance between two data objects in this study hartigan and wong s 1979 algorithm was used to run the k means clustering and the elbow criterion twarakavi et al 2010 was used to estimate an optimal number of clusters in our study 12 clusters were sufficient to present the spatial variance of the shps at both 10 and 30 cm depths as adding one additional cluster did not add sufficient information based on the elbow criterion twarakavi et al 2010 the attributes at the cluster centroid were determined as the shps on the corresponding cluster in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks were measured on each cluster at 10 and 30 cm depths by tension infiltrometer scheme ii spatially uniformed shps derived from rosetta roshom the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 was adopted to predict the shps at the 39 soil sampling sites based on the contents of sand silt and clay the maps of rosetta derived shps were generated by spatial interpolating the shps at these 39 sites using ordinary kriging in arcgis 10 0 the arithmetic means of these maps of shps were used as the spatially uniformed shps in this scheme scheme iii spatially varied shps derived from rosetta roshet the maps of rosetta derived shps in scheme ii were used to obtain the 12 clusters using the k means clustering for 10 and 30 cm depths as the shps predicted by rosetta were more spatially homogenous than those fitted by multirf 12 clusters were adequate to capture the spatial variation the attributes at the cluster centroid were determined as the shps on the corresponding cluster scheme iv spatial uniformed shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs rosrfchom the influences of rfc were considered by adjusting the maps of rosetta predicted shps θr θs and ks in scheme ii by empirical functions proposed by ravina and magier 1984 and brakensiek et al 1986 denoted as rosetta rfc 3 θ t 1 w f θ m w f θ f 4 k st 1 w f k sm where θt m3 m 3 and kst m d 1 are the adjusted residual saturated soil water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the stony soils respectively wf is the volumetric fraction of the rock fragments m3 m 3 θm m3 m 3 and ksm m d 1 are the rosetta predicted residual saturated soil water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix part respectively θf m3 m 3 is the residual saturated soil water contents of the rock fragments set as 0 00 and 0 25 m3 m 3 respectively then the maps of shps derived from rosetta and adjusted with rfc were generated for different depths on the study hillslope the arithmetic means of these maps were used as the spatially uniformed shps in this scheme scheme v spatial varied shps derived from rosetta and adjusted by rfcs rosrfchet the maps of shps derived from rosetta rfc in scheme iv were used to obtain the 12 clusters using the k means clustering for 10 and 30 cm depths twelve clusters were also adequate to capture the spatial variation of the shps derived from rosetta rfc the attributes at the cluster centroid were determined as the shps on the corresponding cluster 2 4 the simulation by hydrus 3d model the hydrus 3d model šimůnek et al 2012 was used in this study the model domain was generated by importing the x y z values respectively convert from longitude altitude and elevation of the surface 20 cm depths and bedrock layer on the study hillslope the z values of the 20 cm depth and bedrock layers were derived by subtracting 20 cm and the db from the surface dem respectively two sub layers were then obtained the topsoil 0 20 cm representing horizon a and the subsoil from 20 cm to the bedrock representing the horizon b the average spacing between nodes in horizontal direction was set as 0 4 m and the total finite elements mesh contained 86 850 nodes arranged in ten mesh layers and resulting in 151 524 3 d elements in the form of triangular prisms the topsoil consisted of the top six mesh layers whereas the remaining lower four mesh layers belonged to the subsoil and the lowest one mesh layer represented the bedrock the spatial distributions of shps at 10 and 30 cm depths in these five schemes were used to represent the shps in the topsoil and subsoil in the scheme of multirfhet the composite hydraulic conductivity function proposed by durner et al 1999 was used to describe the soil hydraulic conductivities in hydrus 3d model the bedrock shps were assumed as θr 0 05 m3 m 3 θs 0 30 m3 m 3 α 1 02 m 1 n 6 05 ks 0 08 m d 1 and l 0 5 referred to heilweil and solomon 2004 and katsura et al 2006 with the similar lithology an atmospheric boundary condition with daily throughfall and potential evapotranspiration etp was imposed on the surface of the model domain fig 1 the upslope boundary and the left side of the domain were treated as zero flux boundaries since the upslope was the top of the mountain and the left side had a trench opened to separate the hillslope with the surrounding area fig 1 a seepage face boundary condition was assigned to the downslope boundary near a pond and the right side of the domain isolated by a trench fig 1 this allowed water to leave the domain through sections of the boundary that were above the field capacity pressure head 0 18 m a free drainage boundary condition was specified for the bottom the bedrock as the groundwater table was deep 8 m and the bedrock had high water permeability fig 1 initial conditions were defined as a soil water content of 0 25 m3 m 3 the etp was determined as crop reference evapotranspiration et0 multiplied by a crop coefficient of the tea assumed to a constant equal to 1 according to stephens and carr 1991 and kigalu 2007 the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was applied to calculate et0 based on the monitored daily maximum minimum and mean temperature the etp was partitioned into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp based on beer s law ritchie 1972 5 e p et p e k l a i 6 t p et p e p where k is the extinction coefficient and lai is the leaf area index in this study k was set to 0 55 according to white et al 2000 the lai was assumed to be a constant equal to 6 through the little varied monthly observed data by lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne usa the tp was employed for simulating the root water uptake according to the s shaped water stress response function van genuchten 1987 the soil water potential at which root water uptake was reduced by 50 p50 in the water stress response function was usually set from 10 m to 50 m however as high rfc in the soils a lower p50 value 8 m was suggested by zhu et al 2009 the exponent in the water stress response function p was set to the recommended value of 3 the root length density was measured using the standard auger method smit et al 2013 total 600 days of observed data from 7 august 2015 to 28 march 2017 were used to run the model the first 234 days were set as spin up period and the simulation results of the latter 365 days from 29 march 2016 to 28 march 2017 were validated by the observed data as no finite element node was exactly corresponded to the depth 10 or 30 cm where soil water content was measured the soil water storage sws calculated by soil water contents at 10 and 30 cm depths at these four sites were used to validate the simulated sws the root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to evaluate the simulation accuracies 3 results 3 1 the fitted and predicted shps the multirf well fitted the observed soil water retention data at different depths and sites on the study tea hillslope and the adjacent bamboo hillslope table 2 fig 2 the rmse values were generally below 0 02 m3 m 3 and the nse values were generally above 0 90 table 2 therefore the shps derived from the multirf were treated as the observed shps the fitted θr θs wf and nf varied at different depths and sites table 2 implying that large spatial variances of shps on this study hillslope for example the largest wf was found at tg02 30 0 60 m3 m 3 while the smallest wf was found at bf02 10 0 18 m3 m 3 the largest nf value was 22 29 at bf02 10 while the smallest nf was 1 48 and at bf04 30 the shps derived from rosetta and rosetta rfc had relatively poor performances in fitting the observed soil water retention data fig 2 the rmse values were generally above 0 04 m3 m 3 and the nse values were generally below zero however shps derived from rosetta rfc were generally better than those derived from rosetta fig 2 the θr values derived from rosetta and rosetta rfc were similar ranging from 0 06 to 0 08 m3 m 3 and generally smaller than these derived from the multirf ranging from 0 08 to 0 22 m3 m 3 however the θs predicted by rosetta rfc were closer to those derived from the multirf than those predicted by rosetta fig 2 smaller curvatures were found for the soil water retention curves derived from rosetta and rosetta rfc than those derived from the multirf fig 2 the mean α was 0 53 m 1 for both the rosetta and rosetta rfc and ranged from 0 44 to 0 69 m 1 and the mean n was 1 66 and ranged from 1 62 to 1 70 3 2 the spatial distributions of shps local ptfs were developed by constructing the regression models between the shps derived from the multirf θr θs and nf and the soil properties and topographic attributes table 3 these regression equations well predicted the θr θs and nf with both the determination coefficient r2 and nse above 0 68 the independent variables for predicting the θr were silt clay and elevation for predicting the θs were sand clay som rfc and db and for predicting the nf were twi clay and som based on these regression models maps of shps derived from the multirf were generated fig 3 great spatial variation can be observed for these shps the spatial mean θr values were both 0 11 m3 m 3 at 10 and 30 cm depths while the coefficients of variations cvs of the θr were 28 1 and 18 6 at these two depths respectively the spatial means of θs was 0 43 m3 m 3and 0 42 m3 m 3 at 10 and 30 cm depths respectively while the cvs for these two depths were 15 3 and 17 5 the spatial means of wf at 10 and 30 cm depths were 0 34 m3 m 3 and 0 36 m3 m 3 respectively while the cvs for these two depths were 18 15 and 24 77 the nf value was generally smaller than 8 00 the cvs of nf were 46 0 and 32 1 at 10 and 30 cm depths respectively the shps of multirfhet in different clusters were shown in table 4 and the spatial distributions of the clusters were shown in fig 4 a and b the 12 clustered shps for roshet and rosrfchet and their spatial distributions at different depths were shown in table 5 and fig 4c f negligible distinctions of the shps among clusters and at different depths were observed for roshet table 5 the θr θs and n were about 0 07 m3 m 3 0 45 m3 m 3 and 1 67 respectively in different clusters and at these two depths the mean α was 0 52 m 1 and ranged from 0 46 to 0 61 m 1 at 10 cm depth and was 0 50 m 1 and ranged from 0 45 to 0 59 m 1 at 30 cm depth at both depths the mean ks was 0 21 m d 1 and ranged from 0 18 to 0 24 m d 1 however for rosrfchet obvious differences of some shps were observed among different clusters and at different depths table 5 the θs ranged from 0 33 to 0 40 m3 m 3 and from 0 30 to 0 40 m3 m 3 at 10 and 30 cm depths respectively while the ks ranged from 0 10 to 0 20 m d 1 and from 0 13 to 0 15 m d 1 3 3 the simulated sws performances of hydrus 3d based on shps derived from these five schemes varied on this study hillslope fig 5 the simulated swss by multirfhet were close to the observations at these four sites with the nse 0 58 and the rmse 16 50 mm both of the roshom and roshet generally overestimated the swss especially during the wet period the nse values of these two schemes at sites tg01 tg02 and tg04 were 0 the swss at sites tg01 and tg04 were overestimated by the rosrfchom and rosrfchet while were well simulated at sites tg02 and tg03 low nse values 0 30 were found for both rosrfchom and rosrfchet at sites tg01 and tg04 at site tg03 the nse values of these two schemes were 0 80 while at tg02 the nse value was 0 60 for rosrfchet but 0 for rosrfchom 3 4 the accumulative boundary flux slight differences were also found among the accumulative boundary fluxes derived from different schemes fig 6 for all five schemes the accumulative free drainage fluxes and evapotranspiration rates were two major sink terms of the water balance which individually accounted for about 50 of the accumulative precipitation 1821 00 mm the smallest accumulative drainage flux 896 00 mm and the largest accumulative evapotranspiration 860 00 mm were found for the roshom and roshet while the accumulative drainage flux around 928 00 mm and evapotranspiration around 840 00 mm were approximate for rosrfchom rosrfchet and multirfhet 4 discussion 4 1 the influences of rfc the shps were well extracted by the multirf fig 2 and the observed swss were well simulated fig 5 by adopting multirfhet in hydrus 3d model as comprehensively considering the pore systems of stony soils the fine earth and the rock fragments the multirf can better characterize the shps in low suction region than the traditional single porosity models durner 1994 šimůnek et al 2003 dettmann et al 2014 fig 2 as shps in multirfhet were calibrated by the observed soil water retention data performances in simulating the sws were obviously better than the other schemes fig 5 however since the soil at tg03 was fine textured wf 0 25 m3 m 3 sand 9 0 the nse of multirfhet in simulating sws was lower than those of rosrfchom and rosrfchet fig 5 this indicated that the multirf may overestimate the influence of rfc for the fine textured soils when the rosetta predicted shps were adjusted by rfc improved accuracies were observed in fitting the soil water retention data and simulating the sws variations figs 2 and 5 for all the depths and sites rmse values in fitting the soil water retention data decreased and nse values increased when adopting the shps derived from rosetta rfc the changed rmse and nse values were significantly correlated with wf p 0 05 which indicated the improved performance by considering rfc were more obvious for the coarse textured soils this is due to that rosetta was constructed without considering the rock fragments thus shps of stony soils were overestimated when predicted by the rosetta after adjusted by rfc based on the empirical equations the predicted shps θr θs and ks decreased and thus the accuracies in fitting the soil water retention data were improved additionally comparing the roshom with rosrfchom and roshet with rosrfchet the nse values all improved and the rmse values all reduced fig 5 however for tg03 with relative fine textured soils the improvements of prediction accuracies were less obvious coppola et al 2013 also demonstrated that better simulations of the average evolution of water content were achieved when the ptfs predicted shps were scaled for stoniness therefore it is necessary to incorporate the rfc as a predictor for the construction of ptfs and the measurements of rfc should be included in the soil survey especially in hilly areas baetens et al 2009 even so imperfect performances were still observed when using the rosetta predicted and rfc adjusted shps as inputs to fit the soil water retention data and simulate the sws variations figs 2 and 5 for example the nse values in simulating the sws variations were below 0 25 at tg01 and tg04 for rosrfchom and rosrfchet fig 5 this indicated that the empirical functions proposed by ravina and magier 1984 and brakensiek et al 1986 may not be effective in all cases which has also been reported by novák et al 2011 and coppola et al 2013 when using the rosetta rfc to fit the soil water retention curves influences of rfc on the curve parameters α and n were not considered this can be a reason for the imperfect performances of rosetta rfc baetens et al 2009 ma et al 2010 4 2 the influence of spatial variation of shps adopting the spatial varied shps can improve the simulation of the sws only when the influence of rfc was considered rosrfchom and rosrfchet fig 5 since the spatial variations of shps predicted by rosetta was low table 5 this improvement was not presented between roshet and roshom fig 5 however comparing the simulation accuracies by rosrfchet with those by rosrfchom obvious improvements were observed at sites tg01 and tg02 reduce the rmse by 47 9 and 48 6 respectively this can be attributed to distinct differences between the shps derived from rosrfchet and rosrfchom at these two sites and the shps derived from rosrfchet may be closer to the actual shps for tg03 as the shps derived from rosrfchom and rosrfchet may be both close to the real values the simulation accuracies were both high for tg04 as the shps derived from rosrfchom and rosrfchet both deviated from the actual shps the simulation accuracies were both low numerous previous studies have emphasized the influence of the spatial variation of shps on simulated hydrological states and fluxes e g herbst et al 2006 fiori and russo 2007 fang et al 2016 baroni et al 2017 many approaches have been proposed to precisely scale and characterize the spatial variation of shps e g vereecken et al 2007 fang et al 2016 however only a few studies were devoted to improving the simulation accuracy by exactly characterizing the actual spatial variation of shps based on the existing scaling approaches for example jin et al 2015 found the simulation by soil and water assessment tool with spatially clustered shps had more accurate performance than using the average soil properties fang et al 2016 employed the information entropy concept for the scale dependent parameterization of soil hydraulic conductivity and found it can improve model performance both in terms of soil water content and runoff simulation the optimal performances of multirfhet fig 5 demonstrated that the k means clustering was appropriate to cluster and simplify the shps spatial distribution this could significantly reduce the simulation times that were needed to run the model with finer resolution of shps the k means clustering has been also used in previous studies for example twarakavi et al 2010 used k means clustering algorithm to determine the optimal number of soil hydraulic classes zhang et al 2016 proposed a combination of k means clustering of kriged soil texture data ptfs and model inversion to parameterize the vadose zone hydraulic properties 4 3 determining proper approaches when the observed soil water retention data were available the multirfhet which calibrated by the observed data and considered the spatial variation of shps yielded the best simulation of sws variations fig 5 when the observed soil water retention data were unavailable the rosrfchet which both considered the influence of rfc on shps and the spatial variation of shps also had acceptable accuracies in sws simulation and could be an alternative fig 5 relative to the multirfhet the rosrfchet is more time efficient and economical as it is not necessary to be calibrated by observed soil water retention data as the influence of rfc on shps and the spatial variation of shps were neither considered in roshom roshet and rosrfchom these schemes were incapable to simulate the sws variations on the stony soil hillslope nse values generally 0 fig 5 considering the spatial variation of shps and effects of rfc on shps had limited influences on the subsurface flow simulation although they had critical influences on sws simulation this was consistent with the study by coppola et al 2013 the reasons for comparatively small differences of the boundary fluxes among different schemes maybe i the sws differences of different schemes only accounted for a small portion of the soil water balance comparing with the precipitation and evapotranspiration on this study hillslope and ii the spatial variations of shps were not strong enough to show obvious effect on the subsurface flow simulation since the study hillslope was comparatively small 0 4 ha therefore in other areas with low precipitation or evapotranspiration but high spatial variations of shps the changed sws may account for large portion in the water balance and thus spatial variation and rfc may show strong effects on subsurface flow simulation to improve the simulation of subsurface flow accurate inputs of precipitation and evapotranspiration can be more important precipitation is usually monitored by raingauge for the evapotranspiration numerous studies have reported its significant influences on the hydrological modelling e g ivanov et al 2010 vereecken et al 2015 feng et al 2017 to acquire the accurate evapotranspiration parameters we should either equip with more advanced monitoring systems e g eddy covariance flux tower and large aperture scintillometer or use more advanced algorithms data to calculate estimate the evapotranspiration rate wang and dickinson 2012 5 conclusions in this study whether considering rfc and spatial variation of shps were necessary in simulating soil water dynamics were investigated on a representative stony soil hillslope results shown adopting the multirfhet which was calibrated by the observed soil water retention data and considered the spatial variation of shps achieved the best accuracies in simulating the sws for this high rfc soil however rosrfchet which considered the influence of rfc and the spatial variation of shps could be the most proper choice in sws simulation since it did not need the observed soil water retention data and calibration the roshom roshet and rosrfchom which did not both consider the influence of rfc on shps and the spatial variation of shps yield unacceptable simulations this demonstrated that for stony soils rfc impacts and spatial variation of shps should be both considered in simulating soil water dynamics however this consideration had limited effects in subsurface flow simulation findings of this study will facilitate the hydrological modeling in stony soils and supplement the knowledge of the influences of rfc meanwhile the results of this study will also be beneficial for the agricultural

7009,the presented paper describes spatial and temporal variations in extended stable isotope datasets of hydrogen and oxygen δ 2h and δ 18o in the sava river water that were used to estimate the mean residence time mrt of stream water using an exponential flow model the re examining mrt was 2 years in the slovenian part of the sava river and was in a good agreement with previous estimates and with the mrt estimated in the sava river at ostružnica near belgrade serbia a mrt 2 2 years was observed in the danube river at vinča also near belgrade the spatial distribution of δ 18o in precipitation over the sava river basin srb was mapped based on the long term weighted mean annual δ 18o values and established relationship with various geographical controls latitude longitude and altitude the

the following recharge and discharge processes flow and the interconnections between aquifers and the sources and mechanism of pollution aggarwal et al 2006a b for this purpose a volunteer database on isotopic composition of river water termed the global network of isotopes in rivers gnir was launched in 2007 by the international atomic energy agency iaea vitvar et al 2007 halder et al 2015 the gnir database supplements the existing iaea global network of isotopes in precipitations gnip monitoring programme established in 1961 http isohis iaea org the gnip has been traditionally used to provide information about the isotopic labeling of different local water sources typically based on local meteoric water lines these datasets can be further used to develop various statistical and geostatistical tools that when combined with geographical information system gis tools can be used to map the spatial variability in isotopic composition among the different components of the water cycle e g bowen 2010 dutton et al 2005 west et al 2008 2014 depending on the spatial coverage and temporal extent of the data available various interpolation techniques can be used to map and model the geospatial distribution of stable isotopes in precipitation these approaches usually take into account different geographical and meteorological controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation e g bowen and wilkinson 2002 bowen and revenaugh 2003 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 dutton et al 2005 lykoudis et al 2009 bowen 2010 giustini et al 2016 however existing large scale models do not capture the finer scale regional complexity and variability this is especially the case in catchments that cover a wide set of geographic and climatic conditions such as the sava river basin srb for the surface waters bowen et al 2011 developed a simple steady state water balance model for surface water isotopic composition using gis they then used this model to evaluate the isotopic relationships between surface water and drinking water across the contiguous united states relatively accurate models for surface water isotope composition can also be developed in the absence of densely distributed surface water monitoring data and can be applied in poorly sampled regions while in the case when monitoring data are available the models can be improved through the incorporation of residual correction bowen et al 2011 in this paper a hydrological research of the surface water in the srb is presented using stable isotopes of h and o the srb plays an important role in groundwater systems in slovenia croatia bosnia and herzegovina and serbia the results of the study can be widened from regional to continental scale since the sava river is the major tributary of the danube river which is a main source of groundwater in the central europe and its main water supply body previous hydrological investigations in the srb were mainly performed in slovenia and near belgrade in serbia while isotopes in precipitation were monitored at different locations mostly within the frame of short term research projects e g vreča et al 2006 golobočanin et al 2007 ogrinc et al 2008 vreča and malenšek 2016 long term isotope data records 20 years in precipitation are available only for ljubljana vreča et al 2014 and for zagreb krajcar bronić et al 1998 vreča et al 2006 as a part of the gnip the isotopic variations in precipitation follow approximately the sinusoidal seasonal pattern where winter months are dominated by colder air masses that bring more 2h and 18o depleted rain and snow and summer months with 2h and 18o enriched precipitation the correlation between δ 2h and δ 18o in ljubljana in slovenia zagreb in croatia and belgrade in serbia are high i e r2 0 98 r2 0 96 and r2 0 97 respectively and local meteoric water lines lmwl vreča et al 2006 2014 golobočanin et al 2007 are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 assuming that precipitation in the mediterranean area is characterized by higher d excess values of up to 25 compared to 10 that are typical of atlantic air masses cruz san et al 1992 rozanski et al 1993 the influence of the atlantic air masses predominates in ljubljana zagreb and belgrade the influence of mediterranean air masses is also important and can contribute more than 20 of precipitation in the north western part of the srb vreča et al 2006 in comparison to precipitation surface water δ 2h and δ 18o values are generally less variable they do exhibit seasonal differences being generally 18o depleted during the winter while 18o enriched precipitation affected summer δ 18o surface water values the spatial variability in δ 18o values across slovenia is consistent with the recharge regimes determined in the sava river catchment hrvatin 1998 changing from alpine high mountain in the upper parts with lower δ 18o values to dinaric alpine in the lower parts of the catchments where δ 18o values are higher and reflect reduced precipitation in this area ogrinc et al 2008 poor correlations between δ 18o values and river discharge r2 0 03 or temperature r2 0 01 were obtained suggesting that the factors influencing the δ 18o values of surface waters are multivariate and more complex the mean residence time mrt of the main sava river stream water in slovenia was similar at all sampling locations with a mean value of 1 32 years and can be characterized as being relatively short indicating a negligible evaporation effect however the 18o enriched isotopic content below šabac in the sava s lower course is a consequence of increased evaporation from the reservoir due to climate conditions and the low river flow and velocity and or growth rate of the phytoplankton biomass the fraction of water lost by evaporation was estimated to be between 10 and 25 miljević et al 2008 although some hydrological investigations have already been performed in the srb they were limited in area or in time periods the study therefore is a follow up of the above mentioned research focusing on extended isotope datasets from the sava river and model the spatial distribution of stable isotopes in the srb using various geographical controls latitude longitude and altitude as predictor variables the study had the following objectives 1 to compare δ2h and δ18o values in the sava river surface water at selected locations from its source to the confluence with the danube river in serbia 2 to compare surface water mrt at sampling locations on the sava river with prolonged isotope datasets in slovenia 3 to estimate the mrt of the sava and danube rivers at belgrade in serbia using the temporal variability of δ 18o values in precipitation and surface water 4 to investigate geographical controls on δ 18o values in precipitation and its spatial variations over the srb and 5 to investigate the relationship between precipitation and surface water δ 18o composition overall the study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of routinely applied water stable isotopes as key tracers in hydrological studies with an emphasis on their application in water management in relation to climatic and human impacts 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the main characteristics of the sava watershed are summarized in this paragraph according to the report of the international sava river basin commission isrbc 2016 the sava river is one of the largest tributaries of the danube river located at the junction area between the southern alps the dinaric mountains and the pannonian plain the river is 945 km long and drains a total of 95 719 km2 of surface area contributing 12 of the danube watershed area and 25 of the total discharge it flows through four countries while the basin area is shared among six countries 12 of the drainage area belongs to slovenia 26 to croatia 39 3 to bosnia and herzegovina 15 5 to serbia 7 1 to montenegro and 0 2 to albania the general elevation of the srb varies between approx 70 m a s l at the mouth in belgrade serbia and 2 864 m a s l at source triglav julian alps the mean elevation of the basin is approx 545 m a s l and according to fao classification the dominant slope in the basin is moderately steep with a mean gradient of 15 8 the sava catchment is situated within a broad region where the moderate climate of the northern hemisphere prevails in the upper part of the srb in slovenia alpine climate prevails while major parts are covered by a warm temperate fully humid climate characterized by warm summers and classified as a cfb climate c warm temperate f no dry season b warm summer according to the köppen geiger climate classification system kottek et al 2006 the mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 7 c rateče slovenia to 12 6 c belgrade serbia similarly precipitation is highly variable and long term average annual precipitation ranges from 600 mm to 2300 mm with an average annual amount of about 1100 mm the highest levels of precipitation were observed in the upper part of the srb in julian alps and at upper parts of the catchments of the tributaries kupa piva tara una vrbas drina and lim rivers areas experiencing the lowest amount of precipitation are the lowland areas of slavonia srem semberija and the kolubara river catchment the average discharge of the sava river is 93 m3 s in ljubljana 318 m3 s at zagreb and 1620 m3 s in belgrade the backwater effect of the iron gate dam djerdap i on the danube river located cca 225 km downstream from belgrade can be also noticed during the low flow as far upstream as to the town of šabac located 105 km upstream from belgrade fourty one important groundwater bodies in the srb were identified with 21 of them located in slovenia 44 in croatia 21 in bosna and herzegovina 13 in serbia and 1 in montenegro in slovenia almost two thirds of the total groundwater storage capacity is located in the srb hydropower generation agriculture and industry can be identified as the main drivers causing hydrological alterations 2 2 sampling and analysis surface water samples were collected at four long term water monitoring locations in slovenia selected based on previous investigation ogrinc et al 2008 and include the following locations the source of the sava river zelenci altitude 830 m otoče altitude 415 m dolsko altitude 265 m and jesenice na dolenjskem near croatian border altitude 140 m in slovenia in serbia two stations were selected one on the sava river at ostružnica altitude 76 m cca 17 km upstream from belgrade and one on the danube river at vinča altitude 74 m cca 25 km downstream from belgrade fig 1 grab surface water samples were taken monthly at approximately the same time of the day from 2007 to 2010 precipitation samples were collected as monthly composite samples of daily precipitation from the rain gauge at the meteorological station of belgrade at zeleno brdo in addition two surface water sampling campaigns were performed within the scope of the globaqua project navarro ortega et al 2015 and cover the period of high and low water discharge in september 2014 and 2015 respectively here results obtained from 10 locations from the sava river source in slovenia to the confluence with the danube river in serbia are discussed fig 1 these are the first data on δ 18o values covering the whole srb and were also used to test the predicted spatial distribution of δ 18o in surface water isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen was determined in collected water and precipitation samples after equilibration with reference co2 the isotopic composition of oxygen was measured epstein and mayeda 1953 on a multiflow continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv instruments while reduction on cr at 800 c was used to determine the isotopic composition of hydrogen in water gehre et al 1996 using a varian mat 250 mass spectrometer stable isotope results for h and o are reported using conventional delta δ notation δ 2h and δ 18o respectively in per mil relative to vsmow the precision of the measurements was 1 for δ 2h and 0 1 for δ 18o 2 3 additional input data precipitation isotope data for slovenia austria croatia and italy were obtained from the gnip wiser accessed 18 5 2015 iaea wmo 1998 more details on slovenian and serbian precipitation data can be obtained from previous studies vreča et al 2006 golobočanin et al 2007 ogrinc et al 2008 vreča and malenšek 2016 acceptance criteria was at least a three years long isotope record the locations of the stations are presented in fig 1 while in table 1 are the average δ 18o values altitude and data recording periods discharges and meteorological data were obtained from the slovenian environmental agency sea and from the republic hydrometeorological service of serbia gis maps with hydrological subunits for the srb were provided by the sea and the international sava river basin commission danubegis 2 4 data analysis basic descriptive statistics i e mean minimum and maximum value were calculated to determine spatial and or temporal variations of isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen in river water weighted averages were computed for isotopic time series of river water and precipitation using average monthly discharge and cumulated monthly precipitation amount respectively seasonal trends in δ 18o in precipitation and surface water of the sava river at selected locations in slovenia and at belgrade and of the danube river at belgrade were modeled using periodic regression analysis to fit seasonal sine wave curves to annual δ 18o variations via least squares optimization defined as rodgers et al 2005 1 δ 18 o δ 18 o ave a cos c t θ where δ 18o and δ 18oave are the modeled and the mean weighted annual measured δ 18o values respectively a is the measured δ 18o annual amplitude c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations 0 017247 rad day 1 t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period and θ is the phase lag or time of the annual peak δ 18o in rad the mean residence time mrt was estimated using the commonly used exponential model in which precipitation inputs are assumed to mix rapidly with resident water using the following equation maloszewski et al 1983 rodgers et al 2005 2 mrt c 1 a z 2 a z 1 2 1 0 5 where az1 is the amplitude of precipitation az2 is the amplitude of the surface water outputs and c is the radial frequency of the annual fluctuation as defined in eq 1 in order to investigate the spatial distribution patterns of δ 18o in precipitation over the srb and its relationship with river water composition a multilinear regression model as proposed by liu et al 2010 was established based on the latitude longitude and altitude as dependent variables as follows 3 δ 18 o a latitude b longitude c altitude m d with the regression coefficients a b c and d which express the contribution of the independent variable to the prediction of the dependent variable the model describes the reported data in the form of yearly means of monthly measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotope characterization of surface river water the isotopic composition at the sampling location jesenice na dolenjskem was similar to that determined in the sava river at ostružnica more than 700 km downstream fig 2 alternatively the differences in δ 2h and δ 18o values between the sava river at ostružnica and the danube river at vinča were statistically significant at a significance level 0 01 using two tailed tests for the period of observation 2007 2010 the difference in the isotopic content can be attributed to the integrated isotopic signal of the large different drainage basins the δ values weighted according to the discharge values were 64 3 for δ 2h and 9 3 0 4 for δ 18o for the sava river and 70 7 and 10 0 0 3 respectively for the danube river table 2 clear seasonal variations were also observed in both the sava and danube rivers the δ 2h and δ 18o values for the sava river reveal a higher isotopic composition during late summer months august september 2004 2010 δ 2h 61 δ 18o 9 0 and a lower composition during spring april may 2004 2010 δ 2h 66 δ 18o 9 9 fig 3 the lower mean temperature of the danube river water by 0 7 c compared to the sava river water is likely one of the reasons for the difference in isotopic composition according to halder et al 2015 s classification the srb belongs to a group were most 18o depleted water is presented in april suggesting winter precipitation run off as a spring freshet these rivers are characterized by relatively low seasonal amplitudes in δ 18o values further a good correlation r2 0 55 between δ 18o values and the river discharge was obtained this is characteristic for a moderate climate with direct surface run off dominated systems halder et al 2015 at vinča on the danube river seasonal variations were similarly pronounced but with a tendency towards more negative isotopic values during the summer july august δ 2h 82 δ 18o 10 1 comparing to the sava river at ostružnica fig 3 this shift in the isotopic cycle could be a consequence of snow melt contribution occurring in spring higher elevation and latitude in the alpine drainage basin icpdr 2008 a similar distribution of lower δ 2h and δ 18o values was also observed at the source of the sava river at zelenci during the whole sampling period indicating that also at this location the origin of water reflects snow melt and elevation effect fig 2 however these effects are already lost in the upper part of the srb before reaching ljubljana this observation could be related to the torrential character of the sava river in the alpine region with steep topographic relief 400 2864 m and thin soils 0 50 cm allowing water to be collected from a larger drainage area the correlations between the river water isotopic compositions and climatic parameters r2 0 95 reveal a good agreement between discharge weighted δ values and annual mean water temperature for the sava river at ostružnica whereas they were low r2 0 43 for the danube river at vinča alternatively a good agreement between the river and precipitation data especially in the case of the sava river was observed and is comparable with previous study golobočanin et al 2007 this observation agrees with other studies that have shown that spatial and temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation were directly reflected in the majority of the river water kendall and coplen 2001 dutton et al 2005 rodgers et al 2005 halder et al 2015 reckerth et al 2017 however seasonal response in river water typically shows a specific time shift and attenuation of the amplitude the close match between mean annual recharge and mean annual precipitation within 10 for δ 2h and 2 for δ 18o is the same where the topography is more subdued rainfall is higher and evaporation is less important kendall and coplen 2001 however both δ 2h and δ 18o values for the danube river at vinča are slightly lower than those in precipitation fig 3 this result could be explained by the large scale mean annual isotopic signatures of precipitation deriving from higher elevations preserved in the danube river water other processes influencing the deviation of δ 18o values in the danube river from local precipitation can be attributed to catchment processes and the contribution from groundwater that is high in the danube river basin reckerth et al 2017 3 2 mean residence time in the sava and danube rivers first the mrt at sampling locations with extended isotope datasets in the slovenian part of the main stream of the sava river were checked for this calculation eq 2 an amplitude of 2 92 from a previous study ogrinc et al 2008 was used the calculated results table 2 reveal a similar mrt obtained for the sampling period 2004 2006 ogrinc et al 2008 the same approach was then used to calculate the mrt in the sava river at ostružnica and in the danube river at vinča fig 3 shows the fitted model data generated by eq 1 for the annual δ 18o variations in precipitation at belgrade and in surface water for the sava and danube rivers during 2007 2010 precipitation data are relatively well described using the seasonal sine wave model r2 0 56 producing a model amplitude of 3 32 comparable with other studies rodgers et al 2005 ogrinc et al 2008 šanda et al 2017 in terms of the surface water sampling location modeled δ 18o values oversimplify the patterns of variation however the results are statistically robust p 0 05 with generally strong correlations between observed and modelled values further lower annual δ 18o amplitude values in surface water compared to those for precipitation were estimated the modelled results were then translated into estimates of the water mrt using eq 2 a mrt of 1 6 years estimated at ostružnica is similar to mrt calculated at the sava river source at zelenci 1 8 years while at vinča the mrt is higher and estimated to be 2 2 years table 2 the estimated mrt for the danube river agrees with that obtained by rank et al 1998 at vienna in their study the mrt was estimated based on long term tritium data however newer calculations using the complete tritium record for the danube river data at vienna suggest that the mrt is substantially older than previous estimates aggarwal et al 2010 a more recent interpretation shows that the mrt has two principal components a fast component that represents water with a short mrt 1 year resulting from recent precipitation and fast run off and a slow old component representing discharges of older groundwater to the river this is not the case for the sava river since the sava river has a fast specific run off and generally represents the source of groundwater in the srb longer mrts coincide with lower mean δ18o values in the surface water found at zelenci probably indicating the greater influence of depleted winter precipitation inputs alternatively a shorter mrt was observed in the lower parts of the sava river in slovenia for example at jesenice na dolenjskem a similar observation was observed by dóša et al 2011 for the váh river below the slovak tatra mountains and by soulsby et al 2010 in the scottish upper dee river in both studies a shorter mrt in stream water 13 months 600 days respectively than in headwaters 19 months 2 years was reported they ascribed this difference to geological and soil conditions the relatively shorter stream water mrt was also determined in the lowland mandava catchment and its tributaries šanda et al 2017 the authors claim that the shorter mrt in lowland catchments may be attributed to river terraces and alluvia which allow the transport of the water from area adjacent to the river this could be also the case in the lowland catchment of the srb a possible explanation of the higher mrt observed at ostružnica could be related to the influence of the danube river due to the backwater effect of the iron gate dam djerdap i 3 3 spatial distribution of δ18o in precipitation over the sava river basin given the complexity of the isotopic composition in the srb especially in the light of the limited number of stations reporting isotopic data and their non uniform spatial distribution in the srb domain the latitude longitude and altitude as proposed by liu et al 2010 was used to determine the geographical controls of δ 18o values in precipitation the relationship between long term weighted mean annual δ 18o values and the three geographical parameters was derived based on data from all 13 stations located within or close to the srb table 1 a multiple linear regression considering all the stations revealed the following relationship 4 δ 18 o 0 787 latitude 0 359 longitude 0 002 altitude m 33 898 the obtained model indicates a good level of prediction r 0 97 and the predictor variables explained 93 of the variability of the dependent variable δ 18o value the independent variables latitude longitude altitude statistically significantly predict the dependent variable f 3 9 42 52 p 0 001 all three variables added statistically significance to the prediction p 0 01 the latitude alone explained 64 3 longitude 43 5 and altitude 66 9 of the variability of the dependent variable these results indicate that altitude effects contribute the most to the geographical control of δ 18o distribution in the srb a similar observation occurs in the δ 18o distribution in precipitation in italy giustini et al 2016 only one station villacher alpe with the highest altitude shows a significantly higher measured δ 18o value compared to the calculated one 10 7 vs 12 0 apart from villacher alpe all residuals are 0 6 the negative anomaly at villacher alpe could be attributed to the combined effect of isotopically negative values in snow and steep topographic gradients that deliver the 18o depleted isotopic signature eq 4 was then used to map the spatial distribution of δ 18o in precipitation over the srb fig 4 while the generation of gridded geographical control factors is based on the usgs gtopo30 digital elevation model the predictive capability of eq 4 and its applicability in hydrological studies was further tested by comparing calculated isotope values with long term average δ 18o values in surface water samples from the sava river available for ten locations in slovenia ogrinc et al 2008 and one at the confluence in belgrade serbia golobočanin et al 2007 covering a wide set of geographic and climatic conditions fig 1 this comparison assumes river water reflects the composition of precipitation as expected a correlation exists fig 5 a r2 0 22 n 10 between the average δ 18o values measured in the river water samples and the predicted δ 18o values in the mean annual precipitation using the geographical control factors of the sampling location the predicted model tends to overestimate i e give positive residuals surface water δ 18o at locations with lower δ 18o values from 0 1 to 0 5 obviously this surface water carries the isotopic signal of the upstream contributing areas that are influenced by the high topographic relief of the region and the high elevation precipitation that is 18o depleted genereux and hooper 1998 kendall and coplen 2001 dutton et al 2005 as it has been also previously mentioned and in correspondence with the short mrt the sava river water is likely result of the river banks covering a larger drainage area therefore for each of the surface water sampling locations the drainage areas were determined and the average predicted δ 18o values in precipitation were calculated this approach resulted in an improved correlation between the measured and predicted δ 18o surface water values fig 5a r2 0 61 n 10 with the exception of belgrade differences between the two values are within 0 5 and fall within the standard deviation of long term δ 18o measurements indicating that the main source of the river water derives from local precipitation moreover the systematic over prediction bias for stations with low δ 18o was essentially eliminated a higher residual of 0 6 between observed and calculated δ 18o values was also present in the sava surface water at belgrade the 18o enriched isotopic content of river water below šabac 105 km before the confluence with danube in the sava s lower course in serbia could be a consequence of increased evaporation occurring in the reservoir due to weather conditions and the low flow and velocity the fraction of water lost by evaporation was estimated to be between 10 and 20 miljević et al 2008 another explanation for the lower δ 18o values observed in the sava river water is due to the backwater effect of the iron gate dam djerdap i where the mixing with the danube river can occur this effect is noticeable as far up as at šabac similar δ 18o values determined in the sava river surface water during the 2014 and 2015 sampling campaign were compared with the predicted averages values in contributing areas a good correlation was observed between measured and predicted δ 18o values fig 5b r2 0 87 n 11 with residuals 0 6 in september 2014 during high water levels reflecting the average composition of precipitation over the entire basin conversely the correlation between the two δ 18o values was lower in 2015 fig 5b r2 0 82 n 11 with residuals up to 1 and all predicted values higher then measured higher residuals were observed at the lower four sampling locations of the srb where the sava river flow and velocity decreases and could be related to evaporation effect in contrast to the year 2014 in september 2015 sampling was performed during baseflow conditions nevertheless these residuals are relatively small and fall within 1 overall the results demonstrate that spatial variations in the precipitation isotopic composition is the dominant factor controlling the variation in surface water isotope ratios across the srb 4 conclusions an extended evaluation of the spatiotemporal variability of water isotopes in the sava river basin srb revealed that seasonal variations in the stable isotopic composition of rivers were closely related to precipitation however the seasonal isotopic variability in river water was lower than that of precipitation indicating that the isotopic composition of river water was more representative of the groundwater and water used by plants and organisms within the watershed a short mean resident time mrt of between 1 0 and 1 8 years indicates a relatively rapid response of surface water to precipitation and also to the water originating from the larger drainage areas adjacent to the river banks a comparison of the modelled isotope values with measured isotope values of surface waters from different locations within the catchment which cover a wide range of geographic and climatic conditions reveal that modelled stable isotope values compare well with the data from surface river water especially if the characteristics of the upstream contribution area are taken into account in addition the results indicate a relatively high power to estimate the isotopic composition of the unsampled surface waters by describing the δ 18o distribution of a single event under extreme conditions like low and high water discharge in the srb the approach used in this study is useful when determining the origin of water at different locations in the sava river catchment for a more accurate prediction the precipitation amount distributions as a control on the spatiotemporal distribution of run off generation within the catchment should be taken into account nevertheless these results are a first attempt to depict the isotope ratios of surface water at the transboundary regional scale and could increase

7009,the presented paper describes spatial and temporal variations in extended stable isotope datasets of hydrogen and oxygen δ 2h and δ 18o in the sava river water that were used to estimate the mean

gnir database supplements the existing iaea global network of isotopes in precipitations gnip monitoring programme established in 1961 http isohis iaea org the gnip has been traditionally used to provide information about the isotopic labeling of different local water sources typically based on local meteoric water lines these datasets can be further used to develop various statistical and geostatistical tools that when combined with geographical information system gis tools can be used to map the spatial variability in isotopic composition among the different components of the water cycle e g bowen 2010 dutton et al 2005 west et al 2008 2014 depending on the spatial coverage and temporal extent of the data available various interpolation techniques can be used to map and model the geospatial distribution of stable isotopes in precipitation these approaches usually take into account different geographical and meteorological controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation e g bowen and wilkinson 2002 bowen and revenaugh 2003 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 dutton et al 2005 lykoudis et al 2009 bowen 2010 giustini et al 2016 however existing large scale models do not capture the finer scale regional complexity and variability this is especially the case in catchments that cover a wide set of geographic and climatic conditions such as the sava river basin srb for the surface waters bowen et al 2011 developed a simple steady state water balance model for surface water isotopic composition using gis they then used this model to evaluate the isotopic relationships between surface water and drinking water across the contiguous united states relatively accurate models for surface water isotope composition can also be developed in the absence of densely distributed surface water monitoring data and can be applied in poorly sampled regions while in the case when monitoring data are available the models can be improved through the incorporation of residual correction bowen et al 2011 in this paper a hydrological research of the surface water in the srb is presented using stable isotopes of h and o the srb plays an important role in groundwater systems in slovenia croatia bosnia and herzegovina and serbia the results of the study can be widened from regional to continental scale since the sava river is the major tributary of the danube river which is a main source of groundwater in the central europe and its main water supply body previous hydrological investigations in the srb were mainly performed in slovenia and near belgrade in serbia while isotopes in precipitation were monitored at different locations mostly within the frame of short term research projects e g vreča et al 2006 golobočanin et al 2007 ogrinc et al 2008 vreča and malenšek 2016 long term isotope data records 20 years in precipitation are available only for ljubljana vreča et al 2014 and for zagreb krajcar bronić et al 1998 vreča et al 2006 as a part of the gnip the isotopic variations in precipitation follow approximately the sinusoidal seasonal pattern where winter months are dominated by colder air masses that bring more 2h and 18o depleted rain and snow and summer months with 2h and 18o enriched precipitation the correlation between δ 2h and δ 18o in ljubljana in slovenia zagreb in croatia and belgrade in serbia are high i e r2 0 98 r2 0 96 and r2 0 97 respectively and local meteoric water lines lmwl vreča et al 2006 2014 golobočanin et al 2007 are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 assuming that precipitation in the mediterranean area is characterized by higher d excess values of up to 25 compared to 10 that are typical of atlantic air masses cruz san et al 1992 rozanski et al 1993 the influence of the atlantic air masses predominates in ljubljana zagreb and belgrade the influence of mediterranean air masses is also important and can contribute more than 20 of precipitation in the north western part of the srb vreča et al 2006 in comparison to precipitation surface water δ 2h and δ 18o values are generally less variable they do exhibit seasonal differences being generally 18o depleted during the winter while 18o enriched precipitation affected summer δ 18o surface water values the spatial variability in δ 18o values across slovenia is consistent with the recharge regimes determined in the sava river catchment hrvatin 1998 changing from alpine high mountain in the upper parts with lower δ 18o values to dinaric alpine in the lower parts of the catchments where δ 18o values are higher and reflect reduced precipitation in this area ogrinc et al 2008 poor correlations between δ 18o values and river discharge r2 0 03 or temperature r2 0 01 were obtained suggesting that the factors influencing the δ 18o values of surface waters are multivariate and more complex the mean residence time mrt of the main sava river stream water in slovenia was similar at all sampling locations with a mean value of 1 32 years and can be characterized as being relatively short indicating a negligible evaporation effect however the 18o enriched isotopic content below šabac in the sava s lower course is a consequence of increased evaporation from the reservoir due to climate conditions and the low river flow and velocity and or growth rate of the phytoplankton biomass the fraction of water lost by evaporation was estimated to be between 10 and 25 miljević et al 2008 although some hydrological investigations have already been performed in the srb they were limited in area or in time periods the study therefore is a follow up of the above mentioned research focusing on extended isotope datasets from the sava river and model the spatial distribution of stable isotopes in the srb using various geographical controls latitude longitude and altitude as predictor variables the study had the following objectives 1 to compare δ2h and δ18o values in the sava river surface water at selected locations from its source to the confluence with the danube river in serbia 2 to compare surface water mrt at sampling locations on the sava river with prolonged isotope datasets in slovenia 3 to estimate the mrt of the sava and danube rivers at belgrade in serbia using the temporal variability of δ 18o values in precipitation and surface water 4 to investigate geographical controls on δ 18o values in precipitation and its spatial variations over the srb and 5 to investigate the relationship between precipitation and surface water δ 18o composition overall the study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of routinely applied water stable isotopes as key tracers in hydrological studies with an emphasis on their application in water management in relation to climatic and human impacts 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the main characteristics of the sava watershed are summarized in this paragraph according to the report of the international sava river basin commission isrbc 2016 the sava river is one of the largest tributaries of the danube river located at the junction area between the southern alps the dinaric mountains and the pannonian plain the river is 945 km long and drains a total of 95 719 km2 of surface area contributing 12 of the danube watershed area and 25 of the total discharge it flows through four countries while the basin area is shared among six countries 12 of the drainage area belongs to slovenia 26 to croatia 39 3 to bosnia and herzegovina 15 5 to serbia 7 1 to montenegro and 0 2 to albania the general elevation of the srb varies between approx 70 m a s l at the mouth in belgrade serbia and 2 864 m a s l at source triglav julian alps the mean elevation of the basin is approx 545 m a s l and according to fao classification the dominant slope in the basin is moderately steep with a mean gradient of 15 8 the sava catchment is situated within a broad region where the moderate climate of the northern hemisphere prevails in the upper part of the srb in slovenia alpine climate prevails while major parts are covered by a warm temperate fully humid climate characterized by warm summers and classified as a cfb climate c warm temperate f no dry season b warm summer according to the köppen geiger climate classification system kottek et al 2006 the mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 7 c rateče slovenia to 12 6 c belgrade serbia similarly precipitation is highly variable and long term average annual precipitation ranges from 600 mm to 2300 mm with an average annual amount of about 1100 mm the highest levels of precipitation were observed in the upper part of the srb in julian alps and at upper parts of the catchments of the tributaries kupa piva tara una vrbas drina and lim rivers areas experiencing the lowest amount of precipitation are the lowland areas of slavonia srem semberija and the kolubara river catchment the average discharge of the sava river is 93 m3 s in ljubljana 318 m3 s at zagreb and 1620 m3 s in belgrade the backwater effect of the iron gate dam djerdap i on the danube river located cca 225 km downstream from belgrade can be also noticed during the low flow as far upstream as to the town of šabac located 105 km upstream from belgrade fourty one important groundwater bodies in the srb were identified with 21 of them located in slovenia 44 in croatia 21 in bosna and herzegovina 13 in serbia and 1 in montenegro in slovenia almost two thirds of the total groundwater storage capacity is located in the srb hydropower generation agriculture and industry can be identified as the main drivers causing hydrological alterations 2 2 sampling and analysis surface water samples were collected at four long term water monitoring locations in slovenia selected based on previous investigation ogrinc et al 2008 and include the following locations the source of the sava river zelenci altitude 830 m otoče altitude 415 m dolsko altitude 265 m and jesenice na dolenjskem near croatian border altitude 140 m in slovenia in serbia two stations were selected one on the sava river at ostružnica altitude 76 m cca 17 km upstream from belgrade and one on the danube river at vinča altitude 74 m cca 25 km downstream from belgrade fig 1 grab surface water samples were taken monthly at approximately the same time of the day from 2007 to 2010 precipitation samples were collected as monthly composite samples of daily precipitation from the rain gauge at the meteorological station of belgrade at zeleno brdo in addition two surface water sampling campaigns were performed within the scope of the globaqua project navarro ortega et al 2015 and cover the period of high and low water discharge in september 2014 and 2015 respectively here results obtained from 10 locations from the sava river source in slovenia to the confluence with the danube river in serbia are discussed fig 1 these are the first data on δ 18o values covering the whole srb and were also used to test the predicted spatial distribution of δ 18o in surface water isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen was determined in collected water and precipitation samples after equilibration with reference co2 the isotopic composition of oxygen was measured epstein and mayeda 1953 on a multiflow continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv instruments while reduction on cr at 800 c was used to determine the isotopic composition of hydrogen in water gehre et al 1996 using a varian mat 250 mass spectrometer stable isotope results for h and o are reported using conventional delta δ notation δ 2h and δ 18o respectively in per mil relative to vsmow the precision of the measurements was 1 for δ 2h and 0 1 for δ 18o 2 3 additional input data precipitation isotope data for slovenia austria croatia and italy were obtained from the gnip wiser accessed 18 5 2015 iaea wmo 1998 more details on slovenian and serbian precipitation data can be obtained from previous studies vreča et al 2006 golobočanin et al 2007 ogrinc et al 2008 vreča and malenšek 2016 acceptance criteria was at least a three years long isotope record the locations of the stations are presented in fig 1 while in table 1 are the average δ 18o values altitude and data recording periods discharges and meteorological data were obtained from the slovenian environmental agency sea and from the republic hydrometeorological service of serbia gis maps with hydrological subunits for the srb were provided by the sea and the international sava river basin commission danubegis 2 4 data analysis basic descriptive statistics i e mean minimum and maximum value were calculated to determine spatial and or temporal variations of isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen in river water weighted averages were computed for isotopic time series of river water and precipitation using average monthly discharge and cumulated monthly precipitation amount respectively seasonal trends in δ 18o in precipitation and surface water of the sava river at selected locations in slovenia and at belgrade and of the danube river at belgrade were modeled using periodic regression analysis to fit seasonal sine wave curves to annual δ 18o variations via least squares optimization defined as rodgers et al 2005 1 δ 18 o δ 18 o ave a cos c t θ where δ 18o and δ 18oave are the modeled and the mean weighted annual measured δ 18o values respectively a is the measured δ 18o annual amplitude c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations 0 017247 rad day 1 t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period and θ is the phase lag or time of the annual peak δ 18o in rad the mean residence time mrt was estimated using the commonly used exponential model in which precipitation inputs are assumed to mix rapidly with resident water using the following equation maloszewski et al 1983 rodgers et al 2005 2 mrt c 1 a z 2 a z 1 2 1 0 5 where az1 is the amplitude of precipitation az2 is the amplitude of the surface water outputs and c is the radial frequency of the annual fluctuation as defined in eq 1 in order to investigate the spatial distribution patterns of δ 18o in precipitation over the srb and its relationship with river water composition a multilinear regression model as proposed by liu et al 2010 was established based on the latitude longitude and altitude as dependent variables as follows 3 δ 18 o a latitude b longitude c altitude m d with the regression coefficients a b c and d which express the contribution of the independent variable to the prediction of the dependent variable the model describes the reported data in the form of yearly means of monthly measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotope characterization of surface river water the isotopic composition at the sampling location jesenice na dolenjskem was similar to that determined in the sava river at ostružnica more than 700 km downstream fig 2 alternatively the differences in δ 2h and δ 18o values between the sava river at ostružnica and the danube river at vinča were statistically significant at a significance level 0 01 using two tailed tests for the period of observation 2007 2010 the difference in the isotopic content can be attributed to the integrated isotopic signal of the large different drainage basins the δ values weighted according to the discharge values were 64 3 for δ 2h and 9 3 0 4 for δ 18o for the sava river and 70 7 and 10 0 0 3 respectively for the danube river table 2 clear seasonal variations were also observed in both the sava and danube rivers the δ 2h and δ 18o values for the sava river reveal a higher isotopic composition during late summer months august september 2004 2010 δ 2h 61 δ 18o 9 0 and a lower composition during spring april may 2004 2010 δ 2h 66 δ 18o 9 9 fig 3 the lower mean temperature of the danube river water by 0 7 c compared to the sava river water is likely one of the reasons for the difference in isotopic composition according to halder et al 2015 s classification the srb belongs to a group were most 18o depleted water is presented in april suggesting winter precipitation run off as a spring freshet these rivers are characterized by relatively low seasonal amplitudes in δ 18o values further a good correlation r2 0 55 between δ 18o values and the river discharge was obtained this is characteristic for a moderate climate with direct surface run off dominated systems halder et al 2015 at vinča on the danube river seasonal variations were similarly pronounced but with a tendency towards more negative isotopic values during the summer july august δ 2h 82 δ 18o 10 1 comparing to the sava river at ostružnica fig 3 this shift in the isotopic cycle could be a consequence of snow melt contribution occurring in spring higher elevation and latitude in the alpine drainage basin icpdr 2008 a similar distribution of lower δ 2h and δ 18o values was also observed at the source of the sava river at zelenci during the whole sampling period indicating that also at this location the origin of water reflects snow melt and elevation effect fig 2 however these effects are already lost in the upper part of the srb before reaching ljubljana this observation could be related to the torrential character of the sava river in the alpine region with steep topographic relief 400 2864 m and thin soils 0 50 cm allowing water to be collected from a larger drainage area the correlations between the river water isotopic compositions and climatic parameters r2 0 95 reveal a good agreement between discharge weighted δ values and annual mean water temperature for the sava river at ostružnica whereas they were low r2 0 43 for the danube river at vinča alternatively a good agreement between the river and precipitation data especially in the case of the sava river was observed and is comparable with previous study golobočanin et al 2007 this observation agrees with other studies that have shown that spatial and temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation were directly reflected in the majority of the river water kendall and coplen 2001 dutton et al 2005 rodgers et al 2005 halder et al 2015 reckerth et al 2017 however seasonal response in river water typically shows a specific time shift and attenuation of the amplitude the close match between mean annual recharge and mean annual precipitation within 10 for δ 2h and 2 for δ 18o is the same where the topography is more subdued rainfall is higher and evaporation is less important kendall and coplen 2001 however both δ 2h and δ 18o values for the danube river at vinča are slightly lower than those in precipitation fig 3 this result could be explained by the large scale mean annual isotopic signatures of precipitation deriving from higher elevations preserved in the danube river water other processes influencing the deviation of δ 18o values in the danube river from local precipitation can be attributed to catchment processes and the contribution from groundwater that is high in the danube river basin reckerth et al 2017 3 2 mean residence time in the sava and danube rivers first the mrt at sampling locations with extended isotope datasets in the slovenian part of the main stream of the sava river were checked for this calculation eq 2 an amplitude of 2 92 from a previous study ogrinc et al 2008 was used the calculated results table 2 reveal a similar mrt obtained for the sampling period 2004 2006 ogrinc et al 2008 the same approach was then used to calculate the mrt in the sava river at ostružnica and in the danube river at vinča fig 3 shows the fitted model data generated by eq 1 for the annual δ 18o variations in precipitation at belgrade and in surface water for the sava and danube rivers during 2007 2010 precipitation data are relatively well described using the seasonal sine wave model r2 0 56 producing a model amplitude of 3 32 comparable with other studies rodgers et al 2005 ogrinc et al 2008 šanda et al 2017 in terms of the surface water sampling location modeled δ 18o values oversimplify the patterns of variation however the results are statistically robust p 0 05 with generally strong correlations between observed and modelled values further lower annual δ 18o amplitude values in surface water compared to those for precipitation were estimated the modelled results were then translated into estimates of the water mrt using eq 2 a mrt of 1 6 years estimated at ostružnica is similar to mrt calculated at the sava river source at zelenci 1 8 years while at vinča the mrt is higher and estimated to be 2 2 years table 2 the estimated mrt for the danube river agrees with that obtained by rank et al 1998 at vienna in their study the mrt was estimated based on long term tritium data however newer calculations using the complete tritium record for the danube river data at vienna suggest that the mrt is substantially older than previous estimates aggarwal et al 2010 a more recent interpretation shows that the mrt has two principal components a fast component that represents water with a short mrt 1 year resulting from recent precipitation and fast run off and a slow old component representing discharges of older groundwater to the river this is not the case for the sava river since the sava river has a fast specific run off and generally represents the source of groundwater in the srb longer mrts coincide with lower mean δ18o values in the surface water found at zelenci probably indicating the greater influence of depleted winter precipitation inputs alternatively a shorter mrt was observed in the lower parts of the sava river in slovenia for example at jesenice na dolenjskem a similar observation was observed by dóša et al 2011 for the váh river below the slovak tatra mountains and by soulsby et al 2010 in the scottish upper dee river in both studies a shorter mrt in stream water 13 months 600 days respectively than in headwaters 19 months 2 years was reported they ascribed this difference to geological and soil conditions the relatively shorter stream water mrt was also determined in the lowland mandava catchment and its tributaries šanda et al 2017 the authors claim that the shorter mrt in lowland catchments may be attributed to river terraces and alluvia which allow the transport of the water from area adjacent to the river this could be also the case in the lowland catchment of the srb a possible explanation of the higher mrt observed at ostružnica could be related to the influence of the danube river due to the backwater effect of the iron gate dam djerdap i 3 3 spatial distribution of δ18o in precipitation over the sava river basin given the complexity of the isotopic composition in the srb especially in the light of the limited number of stations reporting isotopic data and their non uniform spatial distribution in the srb domain the latitude longitude and altitude as proposed by liu et al 2010 was used to determine the geographical controls of δ 18o values in precipitation the relationship between long term weighted mean annual δ 18o values and the three geographical parameters was derived based on data from all 13 stations located within or close to the srb table 1 a multiple linear regression considering all the stations revealed the following relationship 4 δ 18 o 0 787 latitude 0 359 longitude 0 002 altitude m 33 898 the obtained model indicates a good level of prediction r 0 97 and the predictor variables explained 93 of the variability of the dependent variable δ 18o value the independent variables latitude longitude altitude statistically significantly predict the dependent variable f 3 9 42 52 p 0 001 all three variables added statistically significance to the prediction p 0 01 the latitude alone explained 64 3 longitude 43 5 and altitude 66 9 of the variability of the dependent variable these results indicate that altitude effects contribute the most to the geographical control of δ 18o distribution in the srb a similar observation occurs in the δ 18o distribution in precipitation in italy giustini et al 2016 only one station villacher alpe with the highest altitude shows a significantly higher measured δ 18o value compared to the calculated one 10 7 vs 12 0 apart from villacher alpe all residuals are 0 6 the negative anomaly at villacher alpe could be attributed to the combined effect of isotopically negative values in snow and steep topographic gradients that deliver the 18o depleted isotopic signature eq 4 was then used to map the spatial distribution of δ 18o in precipitation over the srb fig 4 while the generation of gridded geographical control factors is based on the usgs gtopo30 digital elevation model the predictive capability of eq 4 and its applicability in hydrological studies was further tested by comparing calculated isotope values with long term average δ 18o values in surface water samples from the sava river available for ten locations in slovenia ogrinc et al 2008 and one at the confluence in belgrade serbia golobočanin et al 2007 covering a wide set of geographic and climatic conditions fig 1 this comparison assumes river water reflects the composition of precipitation as expected a correlation exists fig 5 a r2 0 22 n 10 between the average δ 18o values measured in the river water samples and the predicted δ 18o values in the mean annual precipitation using the geographical control factors of the sampling location the predicted model tends to overestimate i e give positive residuals surface water δ 18o at locations with lower δ 18o values from 0 1 to 0 5 obviously this surface water carries the isotopic signal of the upstream contributing areas that are influenced by the high topographic relief of the region and the high elevation precipitation that is 18o depleted genereux and hooper 1998 kendall and coplen 2001 dutton et al 2005 as it has been also previously mentioned and in correspondence with the short mrt the sava river water is likely result of the river banks covering a larger drainage area therefore for each of the surface water sampling locations the drainage areas were determined and the average predicted δ 18o values in precipitation were calculated this approach resulted in an improved correlation between the measured and predicted δ 18o surface water values fig 5a r2 0 61 n 10 with the exception of belgrade differences between the two values are within 0 5 and fall within the standard deviation of long term δ 18o measurements indicating that the main source of the river water derives from local precipitation moreover the systematic over prediction bias for stations with low δ 18o was essentially eliminated a higher residual of 0 6 between observed and calculated δ 18o values was also present in the sava surface water at belgrade the 18o enriched isotopic content of river water below šabac 105 km before the confluence with danube in the sava s lower course in serbia could be a consequence of increased evaporation occurring in the reservoir due to weather conditions and the low flow and velocity the fraction of water lost by evaporation was estimated to be between 10 and 20 miljević et al 2008 another explanation for the lower δ 18o values observed in the sava river water is due to the backwater effect of the iron gate dam djerdap i where the mixing with the danube river can occur this effect is noticeable as far up as at šabac similar δ 18o values determined in the sava river surface water during the 2014 and 2015 sampling campaign were compared with the predicted averages values in contributing areas a good correlation was observed between measured and predicted δ 18o values fig 5b r2 0 87 n 11 with residuals 0 6 in september 2014 during high water levels reflecting the average composition of precipitation over the entire basin conversely the correlation between the two δ 18o values was lower in 2015 fig 5b r2 0 82 n 11 with residuals up to 1 and all predicted values higher then measured higher residuals were observed at the lower four sampling locations of the srb where the sava river flow and velocity decreases and could be related to evaporation effect in contrast to the year 2014 in september 2015 sampling was performed during baseflow conditions nevertheless these residuals are relatively small and fall within 1 overall the results demonstrate that spatial variations in the precipitation isotopic composition is the dominant factor controlling the variation in surface water isotope ratios across the srb 4 conclusions an extended evaluation of the spatiotemporal variability of water isotopes in the sava river basin srb revealed that seasonal variations in the stable isotopic composition of rivers were closely related to precipitation however the seasonal isotopic variability in river water was lower than that of precipitation indicating that the isotopic composition of river water was more representative of the groundwater and water used by plants and organisms within the watershed a short mean resident time mrt of between 1 0 and 1 8 years indicates a relatively rapid response of surface water to precipitation and also to the water originating from the larger drainage areas adjacent to the river banks a comparison of the modelled isotope values with measured isotope values of surface waters from different locations within the catchment which cover a wide range of geographic and climatic conditions reveal that modelled stable isotope values compare well with the data from surface river water especially if the characteristics of the upstream contribution area are taken into account in addition the results indicate a relatively high power to estimate the isotopic composition of the unsampled surface waters by describing the δ 18o distribution of a single event under extreme conditions like low and high water discharge in the srb the approach used in this study is useful when determining the origin of water at different locations in the sava river catchment for a more accurate prediction the precipitation amount distributions as a control on the spatiotemporal distribution of run off generation within the catchment should be taken into account nevertheless these results are a first attempt to depict the isotope ratios of surface water at the transboundary regional scale and could increase
