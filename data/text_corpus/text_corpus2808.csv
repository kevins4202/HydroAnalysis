14040,a carbon black modified polylactic acid pla sorbent was 3d printed from a commercially available conductive pla filament on a personal 3d printer the internal porosity of the sorbent was controlled through software controlled infill print densities from 15 to 50 the 3d printed sorbent was evaluated for its ability to remove model voc contaminants benzene toluene and ethyl benzene from water where the pseudo second order rate constants for voc sorption were found to increase with a decrease of internal pore size of the sorbent infill density the ability to 3d print carbon based sorbents for on demand point of use water purification presents a potentially useful mechanism for in home or emergency purification situations where consumption of clean water is not possible keywords fused deposition modeling 3d printing activated carbon volatile organic compounds water purification 1 introduction fused deposition modeling fdm is type of additive manufacturing am that has moved into the home consumer marketplace over the past 10 years with the advent of low cost desktop 3d printers in fdm a molten thermoplastic filament is passed through a heated moveable extruder at a temperature slightly above the melting point of the thermoplastic to render a 3d object on a substrate through a layer by layer deposition process recently commercial modifications of polylactic acid pla filaments have been developed to include metals wood fibers magnetic particulates and conductive carbon based materials within the conductive carbon filaments pla carbon black and pla graphene are commercially available filaments sold by proto pasta inc and graphene 3d labs inc respectively the use of 3d printed materials for the realization of porous filtration sorbents and chromatographic separation columns has also been the subject of several recent publications 1 3 the ability to control the size shape position and orientation of a sorbent in a porous bed is attractive because control of the design space is greatly enhanced in comparison to conventional packed bed sorbents using spherical particles to dictate mass transfer though a printed sorbent is similar to a porous monolith an organized mesostructure for the printed bed can be engineered using cad programs while the microstructures in a monolith are dictated by random polymerization processes a cad approach offers not only the ability to better understand and model porous flow but also to potentially revolutionize chromatographic column production and enhance resolution 4 the following communication

pipetting 60 μl of benzene toluene and ethyl benzene into 500 ml of distilled deionized water the resulting aqueous solution of 105 ppm benzene 104 ppm toluene and 103 ppm ethyl benzene is below the aqueous solubility limit for each voc the 3d printed cylindrical sorbents were placed in individual 60 ml epa ptfe silicone lined screwcap vials kimble chase and 50 ml aliquots of the aqueous voc

safety data sheet 6 and daniel et al 7 proto pasta pla carbon black fiber contains 21 83 carbon black the volume resistivity of molded resin before 3d printing is 15 ω cm and resistance of a 10 cm length of 1 75 mm diameter filament is 2 3 kω due to software limitations of the ultimakercura version required for the monoprice mini pro 3d printer a simple grid pattern infill was used a clear visual difference was noticeable between the lower infill densities 15 20 and the higher fill densities 40 50 based upon the 3d layer slices fig 2 experimentally it was also apparent that the displacement of air for the sorbents with smaller cavities higher fill densities was problematic visible light microscopy images fig 3 support this observation as the pore areas range from 1 2 mm2 30 0 5 mm2 40 to 0 2 mm2 50 since water is drawn through the sorbent by the action of vortex spinbar stirring the smaller sorbent porosity can be problematic if the fill density is increased much past 50 unless a significant reduction in surface tension of the solvent can be realized or pressure is used to pump water through the sorbent bed 3 2 extraction and kinetics of voc removal from water control experiments using only a stirbar without a 3d printed sorbent and a stirbar pressed into nonconductive pla did not remove benzene toluene or ethyl benzene over the course of 5 h however for the conductive carbon black pla the percent extraction values in table 1 over the course of 5 h show that a significant reduction in each of the vocs was observed the measured extraction efficiency order

capacity at equilibrium and at time t min respectively 8 9 from the slope and y intercept of plots of t q t vs t the pseudo second order rate constant k g mg 1 min 1 was calculated strong linear plots r 2 0 995 were obtained for toluene and ethyl benzene while slightly less linear plots were observed for benzene 0 960 r 2 0 999 a linear relationship was found between the rate constants as a function of fill density for toluene and ethyl benzene fig 4 indicating that increased surface areas at the higher fill densities are advantageous for faster removal of vocs from water however the rate constants for benzene were lower and did not follow any definite trend with fill density competitive solute solute and solute sorbent interactions for sorbent capacity may have affected benzene sorption in a mixture as opposed to a single component system for the cylinder sorbent design in fig 1 measured sorbent masses increased 0 3 g per 10 increase in fill density and as each cylinder required the same mass for printing the outer solid wall of the cylinder and walled stir bar cavity this reduction of mass effectively resulted in an increase of interior conductive pla for extraction

14041,nitrate is a chemical species usually present in water lakes and rivers and in high concentration can be dangerous to the human health in this work palladium coated alumina pellets associated to a copper plate electrode were tested in an electrochemical dual chamber cell dcc for the treatment of solutions containing high nitrate concentration the tests evaluated how pd catalyst current density and ph have an effect on the reduction reaction and on the formation of nitrite ammonium and gaseous compounds it was possible to observe that the pd catalyst has an influence on the products formed with an increase on the gaseous compounds production the current density plays also an important role on the treatment considering that by applying 1 1 ma cm 2 59 of nitrate reduction was observed while with 1 5 ma cm 2 the reduction was 64 the highest selectivity to gaseous compounds and lower selectivity to nitrite were obtained using alumina pellets coated with 2 5 wt of pd a current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 and with ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 in these conditions a nitrate reduction of 49 was obtained with a selectivity of 64 to gaseous compounds 1 to nitrite and 35 to ammonium the main novelty of this work is the reduction cell design by the use of a dual chamber cell and with the catalyst in pellets form this cell would be suitable for scaling up the process keywords electrocatalytic process nitrate reduction palladium catalyst copper electrode 1 introduction the groundwater pollution by nitrate ion no3 aq which is provided mainly by fertilizers in the agriculture 1 is a global problem the nitrate ion can cause problems to the human health 2 and in general the nitrogen compounds can cause eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems 3 there are several methods to treat water contaminated with no3 aq as for example the biological treatment 4 7 membrane separation processes as reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed 8 9 and bioelectrochemical processes 10 11 however these treatment processes present some disadvantages 12 in the biological process there is sludge generation and in the ro and ed technologies there is the generation of a concentrate nitrate brine that requires a post treatment 13 one post treatment that can be used to treat the ro and ed concentrate solution is the electroreduction the main products formed from the nitrate electroreduction are nitrite ammonium and nitrogen gas 14 the no3 aq electroreduction depends on the current density applied the ions present in solution the solution ph the cathode potential and the electrode material the copper metal cu present catalytic properties 15 to nitrate reduction being this metal appointed as an efficient electrode to nitrate reduction 16 according to de vooys et al 17 nitrate is reduced to nitrite in the active sites of copper the reduction products can either disaggregate from the metal sites being able to stay in solution or be again adsorbed in the copper or another metal surface like palladium pd the no2 aq reduction on copper surface presents smaller activity and selectivity when compared to the one occurring in palladium in fact in palladium sites the nitrite ion is reduced to ammonium or nitrogen the basic principles of the catalytic nitrate reduction with a bimetallic catalyst supported on alumina al2o3 using gaseous hydrogen 18 19 as reducing agent can be employed to avoid the formation of nitrite and ammonium marchesini et al 20 have achieved good nitrate reduction results by applying a catalyst treatment using platinum pt indium in or palladium pd supported in alumina and bubbling h2 gas in the solution by employing the electrocatalytic process 21 22 to reduce the nitrate ion there is the possibility of avoiding the injection of hydrogen gas in the process by using the hydrogen generated in the cathode eq 1 1 2h2o l 2e h2 g 2oh aq in this reaction there is also the oh aq formation that can affect the nitrate reduction leading to a competition between nitrate reduction and oh aq formation the catalyst reactions with pd cu and pd are presented in eq s 2 3 and 4 23 2 n o 3 a q h 2 g p d c u n o 2 a q h 2 o l 3 2 n o 2 a q 3 h 2 g 2 h p d n 2 g 4 h 2

electrocatalytic dual chamber cell dcc separated by a cation exchange membrane the use of alumina pellets with different palladium loads 1 2 5 and 5 associated to a copper plate electrode was evaluated the electrocatalytic process is conducted commonly in two ways using the supported catalyst dispersed in the nitrate solution 24 25 or by adding the catalyst to the cathode electrode 26 28 if the supported catalyst is used dispersed on the solution a further separation step is needed at this work it was evaluated the use of pd catalyst in pellets form conditioned in a polyester fabric bag and placed next to a cu electrode looking for a process operationally easier furthermore the use of the copper electrode in the form of a plate together with the catalyst decreases the cost of synthesis if compared to a bimetallic catalyst for example 2 experimental fig 1 presents the methodology used in this work 2 1 materials based on the nitrate values of concentrated brines obtained from membrane desalination plants 29 a nitrate solution 600 mg l 1 was prepared using sodium nitrate nano3 reagen brazil a sodium sulfate solution 1400 mg l 1 was also prepared na2so4 labsynth brazil palladium chloride p a pdcl2 neon brazil was used in the pellet s synthesis distilled and deionized water was used in the preparation of the solutions alumina ketjen ck300 with 198 m² g 1 surface area and 0 5 ml g 1 pore volume was used as a support in the pellet s synthesis 2 2 electrocatalytic cell and nitrate reduction conditions the nitrate reduction tests were accomplished using a two compartment electrocatalytic cell fig 2 separated by a 16 cm² cation exchange membrane hdx 100 supplied by hidrodex this membrane prevents the nitrate which has been already reduced in the cathode to be re oxidized in the anode the cathodic compartment was filled with 170 ml of the nano3 solution while the anodic compartment was fed with 170 ml of the na2so4 solution both solutions were magnetically stirred a copper plate electrode 15 cm² was used associated with palladium coated alumina pellets in the cathodic compartment the palladium catalyst 0 50 g inside a 100 polyester fabric bag with geometric area of 30 cm² was placed in the cell near to the copper electrode ti 70tio230ruo2 with geometric area of 15 cm² was used as anode the experiments were conducted in galvanostatic mode being performed by fixing the current density through of a power source on 1 1 or 1 5 ma cm 2 the nitrate reduction was evaluated with or without pd catalyst and with or without cathodic solution ph adjustment the ph adjustment was performed by adding h2so4 3 m to the cathodic solution with a burette the ph value was measured using a phtek phmeter model ph 3b all tests were carried out for 6 h at room temperature the cathode potential was also monitored during the tests by means of an ag agcl reference electrode immersed in a luggin capillary and disposed near to the cu electrode surface in some experiments without ph adjustment a gas scrubber with hcl 0 05 m was used to collect the gas that escape during the reaction the dcc cell was sealed and the gas produced was directed to a compartment containing the hcl solution with a vacuum pump if ammonia is formed during the experiments the chemical reaction equation 5 that occurs in the acid solution converts the nh3 g into ammonium the analysis of the acid solution that could contain ammonium ion was performed by ion chromatography 5 hcl aq nh3 g nh4 aq cl aq the cyclic voltammetry data were obtained using a three electrode cell and a potentiostat galvanostat autolab model pgctat 302 n ag agcl saturated was used as a reference electrode copper as working electrode and platinum as counter electrode 2 3 preparation and characterization of pd pellets different load rates 1 2 5 and 5 of pd supported on alumina pellets pd ɣal2o3 were prepared by the wet impregnation method 31 a the metal precursor pdcl2 0 056 m was mixed with hcl 0 1 m in a beaker flask b the alumina pellets were put into the beaker flask with magnetic stirring and heated to 80 c being kept in this temperature until all water was totally evaporated c the pellets were calcinated in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 4 h d the pellets were activated by hydrazine 1 m at 40 c for 1 h e the catalysts were washed with deionized water three times f finally the pellets were dried for 12 h at 80 c and stored for the experiments the synthetized pellets were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd the sem images show the morphologies of the different samples and they were obtained using a jeol scanning electron microscope model jsm 35c the xrd patterns of the fibers were obtained with an xd d1 shimadzu equipment using cukα radiation at 30 kv and 40 ma the scan rate was 1 min 1 in the range 2θ 5 90 2 4 analytical methods the nitrate nitrite and ammonium ion concentration were obtained by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 chromatograph with ionpac cs12a and as22 columns for cations and anions respectively the results of nitrate reduction were expressed as conversion rate x and selectivity s of product formed which are defined as presented on eq 6 and 7 6 x n o 3 1 c t c o x 100 selectivity is defined as the percentage of the total nitrate converted in nitrites nitrogen or ammonia the selectivity is related to the catalyst ability to reduce nitrate or nitrite to nitrogen gaseous compounds and it is calculated by the next equations eq 7 and 8 7 s c a c o c t x 100 8 s c g 100 s n o 2 s n h 4 where co is the nitrate concentration n mg l 1 at the beginning of the reduction process ca is the concentration of products nitrites or ammonium in n mg l 1 at time t and ct is the concentration n mg l 1 of nitrates at time t in this case 6 h the concentration values of n gaseous compounds cgc were obtained by mass balance from the initial no3 aq concentration it was subtracted the nitrate remaining in solution the no2 aq and nh4 aq formed and it was considered that the other formed species are gaseous compounds it is important to highlight that the calculations of products formation were carried out considering that according to cathode potential and cathodic solution ph values observed during the tests the formation of nitrogen oxides is not probable 32 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyclic voltammetry fig 3 shows the cyclic voltammetry curve obtained for the 600 mg l 1 nitrate solution it is possible to observe one peak at 1 5 ma cm 2 which indicates the occurrence of the no3 aq reduction so the tests were performed using this current density value of 1 5 ma cm 2 and with a current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 defined previously by beltrame et al 30 and wang et al 34 with and without cathodic solution ph adjustment and catalyst use in order to ensure that the peak formed belongs to the reduction of nitrate a voltammetry was carried out in sodium hydroxide solution naoh l with the same ph of the nitrate solution verified during the voltammetry 9 0 it can be seen that in the naoh l solution there was no peak formation indicating that the values found when using the nitrate solution correspond to the reduction of no3 aq the galvanostatic operation mode was chosen because this kind of operation is preferred in industrial applications 3 2 experiments without ph adjustment fig 4 a presents the nitrate reduction and products formed with a current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 without cathodic solution ph adjustment and without catalyst it is possible to identify that the nitrate was reduced 59 and the main product formed was the nitrite ion the same behavior was obtained using the current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 fig 4b however in this case there was a higher nitrate reduction 67 than with 1 1 ma cm 2 the gaseous compounds formation was also higher when applied 1 5 ma cm 2 to both experiments the cathodic solution ph was measured and equal to 12 the cathode potential was measured and the obtained values were 0 6 vh and 0 4 vh to 1 1 ma cm 2 and 1 5 ma cm 2 respectively according to the pourbaix diagram 35 these values indicate the formation of nitrogen ammonia or nitrite by measuring the potential of the electrode over the time a variation of approximately 100 mv between the initial and final values was observed in both current densities ammonium was not detected in the gas scrubber so the ammonia was not formed during the experiments without ph adjustment the no formation of ammonia and ammonium is probably due to the low values of current densities employed based on these results it is possible to notice that 1 5 ma cm 2 promote higher nitrate reduction and gaseous compounds formation than 1 1 ma cm 2 moreover for both current density values there was nitrite generation in large quantities and this fact can be associated to the use of copper as cathode 36 37 a material selective to nitrite formation a possible way to increase the gaseous compounds selectivity is by using catalysts 38 40 in this case palladium 17 41 can be used as a catalyst associated to the copper electrode aiming to obtain a higher selectivity to gaseous compounds 3 3 experiments with catalyst and without ph adjustment in a first moment tests were carried out with three different palladium loads 1 wt 2 5 wt and 5 wt pd in the pellet s catalyst table 1 shows the obtained results to nitrate removal and selectivity to nitrogen compounds for the experiments carried out with the current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 without cathodic solution ph adjustment and different palladium loads as it is shown in table 1 by using the copper electrode without pd pellets and with 1 wt of pd pellet the same nitrate reduction 59 occurred and the values of nitrite and ammonium formed were similar by this result it can be inferred that 1 wt of pd is a low value to reduce the nitrite ion to nitrogen gas in these conditions and the system is reacting limited by the available h2 the selectivity to gaseous compounds was increased with 2 5 wt and 5 wt pd and this probably occurs due to the active sites available in the palladium that promote the nitrite reduction eqs 3 and 4 when the catalyst with 2 5 wt and with 5 wt pd were used the selectivity to gaseous compounds was similar considering this result pd alumina pellets with 2 5 wt pd can be a suitable choice to obtain a good selectivity to gaseous compounds with a lower catalyst synthesis cost therefore the next tests will be carried out with the catalyst containing 2 5 wt pd about the possible subproducts that can be formed when the 2 5 wt pd pellets was used the value obtained to the cathode potential was 0 8 vh and according to pourbaix diagram 35 this value indicated the non oxide formation some aspects of this synthetized catalyst are discussed with basis on xrd patterns and sem image by the xrd is observed that the peaks corresponding to ɣal2o3 phase can be seen at 2θ values of 36 7 40 0 45 7 and 66 7 42 45 on fig 5 the signal assigned to the presence of the metallic pd species appear in b patterns at around 39 7 42 it was not observed phase degradation on ɣal2o3 after the synthesis and no peaks of palladium oxide were detectable in the sample fresh and used suggesting that the pd was present in the reduced form in the catalyst by the sem image fig 6 it can be observed various brightly particles and these can be associated to pd present in the alumina support furthermore there was a good distribution of pd particles in the support indicating that the method of catalyst preparation was efficient table 2 shows the obtained results to nitrate removal and selectivity to nitrogen compounds for the experiments carried out with the current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 without cathodic solution ph adjustment and 2 5 wt palladium load on ɣal2o3 as it can be observed in table 2 using the copper plate electrode with 2 5 wt pd pellets and applying 1 5 ma cm 2 the selectivity to gaseous compounds was 35 while to nitrite and ammonium was 31 and 34 respectively comparing to the obtained data to 1 1 ma cm 2 and reported in table 1 selectivity of 41 to gaseous compounds 51 to nitrite and 8 to ammonium it can be observe that the selectivity to gaseous compounds and to nitrite was lower while to ammonium was higher with a current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 this behavior can be attributed to the higher hydrogen amount formed in higher current densities 24 the higher production of reducing agent h2 associated to 1 5 ma cm 2 when compared to 1 1 ma cm 2 and the active sites of palladium may have favored the larger nitrite reduction 3 4 experiments with ph adjustment and catalyst in all experiments without ph adjustment the cathodic solution ph goes up from 6 5 12 0 in the first experimental hour and this value is kept up to the end of the 6 h of experiment in the anode compartment the solution ph decreases from 6 0 2 0 this behavior is due to the reactions that occur in the electrodes in the cathodic compartment there is the formation of oh being h formed in anodic one 46 in addition in the nitrate reduction there is oh formation increasing the ph over the time by mol of nitrate converted the electrocatalytic experiments can be performed in diverse ph values wang et al 34 conducted electrocatalytic tests for nitrate reduction with modified palladium sn and activated carbon in the ratio of 4 1 as cathode the cell was divided using a nafion 117 membrane and it was operated at constant current and ph 7 6 in 4 h of experiment conducted with 24 5 n mg l 1 of no3 aq and current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 96 of nitrate was removed and converted mainly to ammonium and nitrogen yang et al 41 carried out the catalyst reduction of nitrate on pd cu tio2 catalyst and showed that in alkaline ph the activity to nitrate reduction is high while the activity to nitrite reduction occur in acid ph to study the influence of ph in the catalyst nitrate reduction pintar and batista 47 studied the chemical reduction of no3 aq in two steps firstly in high ph above 11 the authors used pd cu ɣal2o3 to reduce the nitrate ion to nitrite in the second reactor the reduction was accomplished with pd ɣal2o3 in ph 4 5 and the selective reduction was to nitrogen there are several methods and acids for adjusting ph berndt et al 48 for example used h2so4 or hcl to adjusted the ph to 6 0 on their experiments with palladium based on the reported considerations about the importance of ph adjustment experiments with copper plate electrode with and without pd catalyst 1 1 ma cm 2 and 1 5 ma cm 2 as applied current densities and with cathodic solution ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 were accomplished fig 7 a and b shows the nitrate reduction data obtained using the current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 without catalyst and with ph adjustment it is evident comparing the fig 7a and b that by adjusting the ph the nitrate reduction decreases in alkaline conditions without ph adjustment fig 4 the no3 aq reduction was 59 at 6 h of experiment and in acid condition with ph adjustment fig 7 only 33 of the nitrate was reduced the same behavior occurs with 1 5 ma cm 2 where the nitrate reduction with ph adjustment was 46 while with alkaline solution the nitrate reduction was 67 this decrease in nitrate reduction was also obtained in the work of yang et al 41 and prasad et al 16 prasad et al 16 studied the ph effect in the electrolytic nitrate removal from a groundwater containing 190 mg l 1 of nitrate and obtained almost 20 of no3 aq reduction in ph 6 and 30 in ph 10 so the increase of ph also increased the nitrate reduction the observed decrease in the nitrate reduction in acid conditions can be associated to the sulfate anion so4 2 added to the solution huang et al 49 studied the influence of anions concentration in the nitrate electrochemical reduction showing that anions cl hco3 and so4 2 can influence the nitrate reduction still according to de vooys et al 17 the nitrate reduction can be smaller in presence of so4 2 because the sulfate can hinder the nitrate adsorption in the cu or pd active sites the ammonium formation was higher than the production of gaseous compounds in both current densities used fig 7a and b comparing the results with and without ph adjustment the main difference in the formed products was to nitrite and ammonium ions in alkaline ph the nitrite formation was favored while in acid solution there was a higher ammonium production a higher activity of the nitrite reducing catalyst can be favored at ph values where the metal pd is positively charged h favoring the nitrite ion adsorption which are negatively charged in the metal still the surface can be covered with different chemical species mainly h at low ph and oh in alkaline media while the hydroxyl ions can be adsorbed at the active sites of the catalyst and limit the reduction of the nitrogen compounds the presence of h can increase the nitrite reduction 50 51 lastly aiming to avoid the nh4 aq formation the 2 5 wt pd pellets catalyst were used for 1 1 and 1 5 ma cm 2 with ph adjustment table 3 shows the obtained results to nitrate removal and selectivity to nitrogen compounds for the experiments carried out with the current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 and 1 5 ma cm 2 with cathodic solution ph adjustment and 2 5 wt palladium load on ɣal2o3 with the solution ph adjustment table 3 using a current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 and 2 5 wt pd pellets catalyst a higher formation of gaseous compounds was observed when the results are compared to ones obtained with alkaline solution table 2 the cathode potential value using 1 1 ma cm 2 and 2 5 wt pd pellets was 0 6 vh that according the pourbaix diagram 35 indicated the ammonium formation it is observed by results with 1 1 ma cm 2 that the ammonium formation increased when the ph was adjusted without significant differences in the gaseous compounds formation applying 1 5 ma cm 2 with catalyst and adjusting the ph the nitrite formation was practically null and the selectivity to gaseous compounds was 64 the better selectivity to gaseous compounds applying 1 5 ma cm 2 could be attributed to the higher cathode hydrogen generation than with 1 1 ma cm 2 comparing the products formed with 1 5 ma cm 2 in acid condition table 3 with the alkaline ones table 2 it is possible to say that the use of catalyst in acid condition favored the gaseous compounds formation considering that the oh concentration in solution is not high the adsorption of nitrite in active sites of palladium can be favored what produces an increase of gaseous compounds mikami et al 52 studied the kinetic and adsorption on the hydrogenation of no3 aq and observed that in ph values higher than 7 the no2 aq is less adsorbed on the catalyst surface since the oh could inhibit the nitrite adsorption on the catalyst the final cathode potential obtained by the experimental parameters of using pellets with 2 5 wt pd current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 and ph adjustment was 0 8 vh indicating the possible formation of ammonium 35 zhang et al 24 studied the electrocatalytic reduction of 50 n mg l 1 of nitrate with pd cu ɣal2o3 dispersed in the cathodic compartment the ɣal2o3 was impregnated with pd and cu and graphite was used as cathode and anode applying a current density of 2 ma cm 2 the authors found a closed selectivity to gaseous compound 69 9 than the obtained in this work 64 fig 8 presents a scheme about the interaction of cu and pd with the nitrate ion and the formed products the scheme resumes the obtained results where the cu electrode acts to reduce the nitrate to nitrite ion and the pd catalyst reduces the nitrite to ammonium and gaseous compounds mainly nitrogen gas according to shin et al 39 the selectivity to n2 g depends on the nitrite reduction on the pd surface the hydrogen generated in the copper electrode surface diffuses to the surface of the pd catalyst where the pd is able to dissociate the hydrogen in two adsorbed atoms causing the reduction of the no3 aq to no2 aq and the no2 aq to nh4 aq or n2 g depending on the environmental conditions 30 in the cell used in this work the metal copper provides the electrochemical reduction while the palladium pellets act by catalytic chemical reduction final power density was calculated to all current densities and cell potential used at this work and it was obtained a value of 103 10 w m² there was low variance in the values obtained and the average obtained indicates a low energy consumption during the electroreduction process 4 conclusion this work shows that the electrocatalytic method with copper plate electrode and pd coated alumina pellets can be used to reduce nitrate ion in water with high nitrate concentrations and can be a novelty alternative to the electrocatalytic method that usually uses the supported catalyst dispersed in the nitrate solution the highest gaseous compounds formation was obtained with a current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 with 2 5 wt pd coated alumina pellets and with ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 in these conditions it was obtained a selectivity of 64 to gaseous compounds and only 1 to nitrite in fact the use of a dual chamber cell with copper electrode associated to pd catalyst in form of pellets is a promising process to the reduction of nitrate ion

14041,nitrate is a chemical species usually present in water lakes and rivers and in high concentration can be dangerous to the human health in this work palladium coated alumina pellets associated to a copper plate electrode were tested in an electrochemical dual chamber cell dcc for the treatment of solutions containing high nitrate concentration the tests evaluated how pd catalyst current density and ph have an effect on the reduction reaction and on the formation of nitrite ammonium and gaseous compounds it was possible to observe that the pd catalyst has an influence on the products formed with an increase on the gaseous compounds production the current density plays also an important role on the treatment considering that by applying 1 1 ma cm 2 59 of nitrate reduction was observed while with 1 5 ma cm 2 the reduction was 64 the highest selectivity to gaseous compounds and lower selectivity to nitrite were obtained using alumina pellets coated with 2 5 wt of pd a current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 and with ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 in these conditions a nitrate reduction of 49 was obtained with a selectivity of 64 to gaseous compounds 1 to nitrite and 35 to ammonium the main novelty of this work is the reduction cell design by the use of a dual chamber cell and with the catalyst in pellets form this cell would be suitable for scaling up the process keywords electrocatalytic process nitrate reduction palladium catalyst copper electrode 1 introduction the groundwater pollution by nitrate ion no3 aq which is provided mainly by fertilizers in the agriculture 1 is a global problem the nitrate ion can cause problems to the human health 2 and in general the nitrogen compounds can cause eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems 3 there are several methods to treat water contaminated with no3 aq as for example the biological treatment 4 7 membrane separation processes as reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed 8 9 and bioelectrochemical processes 10 11 however these treatment processes present some disadvantages 12 in the biological process there is sludge generation and in the ro and ed technologies there is the generation of a concentrate nitrate brine that requires a post treatment 13 one post treatment that can be used to treat the ro and ed concentrate solution is the electroreduction the main products formed from the nitrate electroreduction are nitrite ammonium and nitrogen gas 14 the no3 aq electroreduction depends on the current density applied the ions present in solution the solution ph the cathode potential and the electrode material the copper metal cu present catalytic properties 15 to nitrate reduction being this metal appointed as an efficient electrode to nitrate reduction 16 according to de vooys et al 17 nitrate is reduced to nitrite in the active sites of copper the reduction products can either disaggregate from the metal sites being able to stay in solution or be again adsorbed in the copper or another metal surface like palladium pd the no2 aq reduction on copper surface presents smaller activity and selectivity when compared to the one occurring in palladium in fact in palladium sites the nitrite ion is reduced to ammonium or nitrogen the basic principles of the catalytic nitrate reduction with a bimetallic catalyst supported on alumina al2o3 using gaseous hydrogen 18 19 as reducing agent can be employed to avoid the formation of nitrite and ammonium marchesini et al 20 have achieved good nitrate reduction results by applying a catalyst treatment using platinum pt indium in or palladium pd supported in alumina and bubbling h2 gas in the solution by employing the electrocatalytic process 21 22 to reduce the nitrate ion there is the possibility of avoiding the injection of hydrogen gas in the process by using the hydrogen generated in the cathode eq 1 1 2h2o l 2e h2 g 2oh aq in this reaction there is also the oh aq formation that can affect the nitrate reduction leading to a competition between nitrate reduction and oh aq formation the catalyst reactions with pd cu and pd are presented in eq s 2 3 and 4 23 2 n o 3 a q h 2 g p d c u n o 2 a q h 2 o l 3 2 n o 2 a q 3 h 2 g 2 h p d n 2 g 4 h 2

electrocatalytic dual chamber cell dcc separated by a cation exchange membrane the use of alumina pellets with different palladium loads 1 2 5 and 5 associated to a copper plate electrode was evaluated the electrocatalytic process is conducted commonly in two ways using the supported catalyst dispersed in the nitrate solution 24 25 or by adding the catalyst to the cathode electrode 26 28 if the supported catalyst is used dispersed on the solution a further separation step is needed at this work it was evaluated the use of pd catalyst in pellets form conditioned in a polyester fabric bag and placed next to a cu electrode looking for a process operationally easier furthermore the use of the copper electrode in the form of a plate together with the catalyst decreases the cost of synthesis if compared to a bimetallic catalyst for example 2 experimental fig 1 presents the methodology used in this work 2 1 materials based on the nitrate values of concentrated brines obtained from membrane desalination plants 29 a nitrate solution 600 mg l 1 was prepared using sodium nitrate nano3 reagen brazil a sodium sulfate solution 1400 mg l 1 was also prepared na2so4 labsynth brazil palladium chloride p a pdcl2 neon brazil was used in the pellet s synthesis distilled and deionized water was used in the preparation of the solutions alumina ketjen ck300 with 198 m² g 1 surface area and 0 5 ml g 1 pore volume was used as a support in the pellet s synthesis 2 2 electrocatalytic cell and nitrate reduction conditions the nitrate reduction tests were accomplished using a two compartment electrocatalytic cell fig 2 separated by a 16 cm² cation exchange membrane hdx 100 supplied by hidrodex this membrane prevents the nitrate which has been already reduced in the cathode to be re oxidized in the anode the cathodic compartment was filled with 170 ml of the nano3 solution while the anodic compartment was fed with 170 ml of the na2so4 solution both solutions were magnetically stirred a copper plate electrode 15 cm² was used associated with palladium coated alumina pellets in the cathodic compartment the palladium catalyst 0 50 g inside a 100 polyester fabric bag with geometric area of 30 cm² was placed in the cell near to the copper electrode ti 70tio230ruo2 with geometric area of 15 cm² was used as anode the experiments were conducted in galvanostatic mode being performed by fixing the current density through of a power source on 1 1 or 1 5 ma cm 2 the nitrate reduction was evaluated with or without pd catalyst and with or without cathodic solution ph adjustment the ph adjustment was performed by adding h2so4 3 m to the cathodic solution with a burette the ph value was measured using a phtek phmeter model ph 3b all tests were carried out for 6 h at room temperature the cathode potential was also monitored during the tests by means of an ag agcl reference electrode immersed in a luggin capillary and disposed near to the cu electrode surface in some experiments without ph adjustment a gas scrubber with hcl 0 05 m was used to collect the gas that escape during the reaction the dcc cell was sealed and the gas produced was directed to a compartment containing the hcl solution with a vacuum pump if ammonia is formed during the experiments the chemical reaction equation 5 that occurs in the acid solution converts the nh3 g into ammonium the analysis of the acid solution that could contain ammonium ion was performed by ion chromatography 5 hcl aq nh3 g nh4 aq cl aq the cyclic voltammetry data were obtained using a three electrode cell and a potentiostat galvanostat autolab model pgctat 302 n ag agcl saturated was used as a reference electrode copper as working electrode and platinum as counter electrode 2 3 preparation and characterization of pd pellets different load rates 1 2 5 and 5 of pd supported on alumina pellets pd ɣal2o3 were prepared by the wet impregnation method 31 a the metal precursor pdcl2 0 056 m was mixed with hcl 0 1 m in a beaker flask b the alumina pellets were put into the beaker flask with magnetic stirring and heated to 80 c being kept in this temperature until all water was totally evaporated c the pellets were calcinated in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 4 h d the pellets were activated by hydrazine 1 m at 40 c for 1 h e the catalysts were washed with deionized water three times f finally the pellets were dried for 12 h at 80 c and stored for the experiments the synthetized pellets were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd the sem images show the morphologies of the different samples and they were obtained using a jeol scanning electron microscope model jsm 35c the xrd patterns of the fibers were obtained with an xd d1 shimadzu equipment using cukα radiation at 30 kv and 40 ma the scan rate was 1 min 1 in the range 2θ 5 90 2 4 analytical methods the nitrate nitrite and ammonium ion concentration were obtained by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 chromatograph with ionpac cs12a and as22 columns for cations and anions respectively the results of nitrate reduction were expressed as conversion rate x and selectivity s of product formed which are defined as presented on eq 6 and 7 6 x n o 3 1 c t c o x 100 selectivity is defined as the percentage of the total nitrate converted in nitrites nitrogen or ammonia the selectivity is related to the catalyst ability to reduce nitrate or nitrite to nitrogen gaseous compounds and it is calculated by the next equations eq 7 and 8 7 s c a c o c t x 100 8 s c g 100 s n o 2 s n h 4 where co is the nitrate concentration n mg l 1 at the beginning of the reduction process ca is the concentration of products nitrites or ammonium in n mg l 1 at time t and ct is the concentration n mg l 1 of nitrates at time t in this case 6 h the concentration values of n gaseous compounds cgc were obtained by mass balance from the initial no3 aq concentration it was subtracted the nitrate remaining in solution the no2 aq and nh4 aq formed and it was considered that the other formed species are gaseous compounds it is important to highlight that the calculations of products formation were carried out considering that according to cathode potential and cathodic solution ph values observed during the tests the formation of nitrogen oxides is not probable 32 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyclic voltammetry fig 3 shows the cyclic voltammetry curve obtained for the 600 mg l 1 nitrate solution it is possible to observe one peak at 1 5 ma cm 2 which indicates the occurrence of the no3 aq reduction so the tests were performed using this current density value of 1 5 ma cm 2 and with a current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 defined previously by beltrame et al 30 and wang et al 34 with and without cathodic solution ph adjustment and catalyst use in order to ensure that the peak formed belongs to the reduction of nitrate a voltammetry was carried out in sodium hydroxide solution naoh l with the same ph of the nitrate solution verified during the voltammetry 9 0 it can be seen that in the naoh l solution there was no peak formation indicating that the values found when using the nitrate solution correspond to the reduction of no3 aq the galvanostatic operation mode was chosen because this kind of operation is preferred in industrial applications 3 2 experiments without ph adjustment fig 4 a presents the nitrate reduction and products formed with a current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 without cathodic solution ph adjustment and without catalyst it is possible to identify that the nitrate was reduced 59 and the main product formed was the nitrite ion the same behavior was obtained using the current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 fig 4b however in this case there was a higher nitrate reduction 67 than with 1 1 ma cm 2 the gaseous compounds formation was also higher when applied 1 5 ma cm 2 to both experiments the cathodic solution ph was measured and equal to 12 the cathode potential was measured and the obtained values were 0 6 vh and 0 4 vh to 1 1 ma cm 2 and 1 5 ma cm 2 respectively according to the pourbaix diagram 35 these values indicate the formation of nitrogen ammonia or nitrite by measuring the potential of the electrode over the time a variation of approximately 100 mv between the initial and final values was observed in both current densities ammonium was not detected in the gas scrubber so the ammonia was not formed during the experiments without ph adjustment the no formation of ammonia and ammonium is probably due to the low values of current densities employed based on these results it is possible to notice that 1 5 ma cm 2 promote higher nitrate reduction and gaseous compounds formation than 1 1 ma cm 2 moreover for both current density values there was nitrite generation in large quantities and this fact can be associated to the use of copper as cathode 36 37 a material selective to nitrite formation a possible way to increase the gaseous compounds selectivity is by using catalysts 38 40 in this case palladium 17 41 can be used as a catalyst associated to the copper electrode aiming to obtain a higher selectivity to gaseous compounds 3 3 experiments with catalyst and without ph adjustment in a first moment tests were carried out with three different palladium loads 1 wt 2 5 wt and 5 wt pd in the pellet s catalyst table 1 shows the obtained results to nitrate removal and selectivity to nitrogen compounds for the experiments carried out with the current density of 1 1 ma cm 2 without cathodic solution ph adjustment and different palladium loads as it is shown in table 1 by using the copper electrode without pd pellets and with 1 wt of pd pellet the same nitrate reduction 59 occurred and the values of nitrite and ammonium formed were similar by this result it can be inferred that 1 wt of pd is a low value to reduce the nitrite ion to nitrogen gas in these conditions and the system is reacting limited by the available h2 the selectivity to gaseous compounds was increased with 2 5 wt and 5 wt pd and this probably occurs due to the active sites available in the palladium that promote the nitrite reduction eqs 3 and 4 when the catalyst with 2 5 wt and with 5 wt pd were used the selectivity to gaseous compounds was similar considering this result pd alumina pellets with 2 5 wt pd can be a suitable choice to obtain a good selectivity to gaseous compounds with a lower catalyst synthesis cost therefore the next tests will be carried out with the catalyst containing 2 5 wt pd about the possible subproducts that can be formed when the 2 5 wt pd pellets was used the value obtained to the cathode potential was 0 8 vh and according to pourbaix diagram 35 this value indicated the non oxide formation some aspects of this synthetized catalyst are discussed with basis on xrd patterns and sem image by the xrd is observed that the peaks corresponding to ɣal2o3 phase can be seen at 2θ values of 36 7 40 0 45 7 and 66 7 42 45 on fig 5 the signal assigned to the presence of the metallic pd species appear in b patterns at around 39 7 42 it was not observed phase degradation on ɣal2o3 after the synthesis and no peaks of palladium oxide were detectable in the sample fresh and used suggesting that the pd was present in the reduced form in the catalyst by the sem image fig 6 it can be observed various brightly particles and these can be associated to pd present in the alumina support furthermore there was a good distribution of pd particles in the support indicating that the method of catalyst preparation was efficient table 2 shows the obtained results to nitrate removal and selectivity to nitrogen compounds for the experiments carried out with the current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 without cathodic solution ph adjustment and 2 5 wt palladium load on ɣal2o3 as it can be observed in table 2 using the copper plate electrode with 2 5 wt pd pellets and applying 1 5 ma cm 2 the selectivity to gaseous compounds was 35 while to nitrite and ammonium was 31 and 34 respectively comparing to the obtained data to 1 1 ma cm 2 and reported in table 1 selectivity of 41 to gaseous compounds 51 to nitrite and 8 to ammonium it can be observe that the selectivity to gaseous compounds and to nitrite was lower while to ammonium was higher with a current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 this behavior can be attributed to the higher hydrogen amount formed in higher current densities 24 the higher production of reducing agent h2 associated to 1 5 ma cm 2 when compared to 1 1 ma cm 2 and the active sites of palladium may have favored the larger nitrite reduction 3 4 experiments with ph adjustment and catalyst in all experiments without ph adjustment the cathodic solution ph goes up from 6 5 12 0 in the first experimental hour and this value is kept up to the end of the 6 h of experiment in the anode compartment the solution ph decreases from 6 0 2 0 this behavior is due to the

to dissociate the hydrogen in two adsorbed atoms causing the reduction of the no3 aq to no2 aq and the no2 aq to nh4 aq or n2 g depending on the environmental conditions 30 in the cell used in this work the metal copper provides the electrochemical reduction while the palladium pellets act by catalytic chemical reduction final power density was calculated to all current densities and cell potential used at this work and it was obtained a value of 103 10 w m² there was low variance in the values obtained and the average obtained indicates a low energy consumption during the electroreduction process 4 conclusion this work shows that the electrocatalytic method with copper plate electrode and pd coated alumina pellets can be used to reduce nitrate ion in water with high nitrate concentrations and can be a novelty alternative to the electrocatalytic method that usually uses the supported catalyst dispersed in the nitrate solution the highest gaseous compounds formation was obtained with a current density of 1 5 ma cm 2 with 2 5 wt pd coated alumina pellets and with ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 in these conditions it was obtained a selectivity of 64 to gaseous compounds and only 1 to nitrite in fact the use of a dual chamber cell with copper electrode associated to pd catalyst in form of pellets is a promising process to the reduction of nitrate ion

14042,comparative study of reactive blue 194 rb194 degradation using activated carbon catalyzed ozonation acco as a hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes ho aops and single ozonation o3 processes was investigated in this study furthermore the effect of chloride ion cl on the dye reduction and mineralization was evaluated at different ph values acco was more successful in the reduction of uv254 absorbance and chemical oxygen demand cod removal in acco the dye reduction was marginally increased with adding nacl concentration from 5 to 50 g l while in o3 process no significant differences were found in acco higher dye removal rate could be attributed to the production of reactive chlorine species the results exhibited that temperature elevation promoted color aromaticity and cod removal in the acco process regeneration of activated carbon by ozone modified surface characterization through addition of acidic oxygen groups in summary the acco process can be

which categorized as xenobiotic compounds 2 in reactive dyeing chromatic alkaline wastewaters with high concentrations of dissolved solids especially chloride ions cl and high temperature are discharged into the environment 3 reactive dyes are highly soluble and recalcitrant and hardly removed using biological processes 4 advanced oxidation processes aops have recently received remarkable attention in water and wastewater purification for degrading refractory pollutants 5 also increasing quality requirements for water reuse and intensified discharge regulations have ramped up implementation of aops for wastewater treatment in industrial scale 6 however high concentrations of cl in reactive dye wastewaters considered a major obstacle for the practical application of aops

absorption by dye molecules has mentioned as a major weakness for uv h2o2 process in dye wastewater which results blocking generation of ho 23 in electro fenton and ultrasound processes sludge management large energy requirement and the required long reaction time are other suggested drawbacks 24 25 in spite of successful dye mineralization through catalytic ozonation using iron slag wastes 26 ni containing layered double hydroxide nanocatalyst 27 silica supported cu 28 zinc slag waste 29 or acid activated clays 30 in different aqueous solutions but there is still insufficient information with the effect of cl on dye mineralization mechanisms in catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation is expanded to dominate the limitations of single ozonation e g inefficient treatment of saturated organic compounds through promoting ho generation and decreasing ozone consumption 31 32 among the various catalysts activated carbon ac has attracted a great deal of notice because of its wide availability low cost no metal leaching and high porous surface area 33 34 activated carbon catalyzed ozonation acco could improve oxidation of organic compounds through initiating promoting role of ac in the radical type chain reactions of ozone decomposition and formation of ho 35 36 furthermore this technique provides the benefit of continuous reactions of oxidizing agents with adsorbed compounds on ac 37 however there is increasing concern over the stability and reusability of ac previous studies revealed that ac offer poor catalytic stabilities owing to the changes in the surface chemistry and masking of active sites by degradation intermediates 38 39 although the stability of ac has been surveyed in some batch studies however few cycles tests cannot be decisive in the determination of the longevity of a catalyst after all probable depletion of adsorption sites can be achieved by in situ facile scalable and cost effectiveness ozone regeneration then to address the aforementioned disparities a pilot scale acco process in comparison with single ozonation were used to investigate the effect of various cl concentration on the degradation of reactive blue 194 rb194 dye in addition cl impact on the dye removal and mineralization was evaluated at different ph values and temperatures then in the second phase the stability of ac over the long term of trials and regeneration efficiency by ozonation were examined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and morphological textural analyses by scanning electron microscopy sem and brunauer emmett teller bet 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents rb194 containing 40 sodium sulfate ohyoung co south korea was provided via a local textile company the main characteristics of the dye are presented in table 1 bituminous coal based granular activated carbon gac was obtained from jacobi carbons co sweden aquasorb 101 8 30 mesh particle size and 864 1 m2 g bet surface area and it was used as received all other analytical grade chemicals and reagents used in the experiments including nacl and tert butyl alcohol tba were purchased from merck 2 2 preparation of synthetic dye solutions reactive dyes are found in hydrolyzed form in textile dyeing wastewater then the hydrolyzed stock solutions 6000 mg l were prepared according to the procedure used by pereira et al 2003 40 the different concentrations of rb194 10 200 mg l were prepared from this solution using double distilled water and the intended ph was adjusted either by sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide nacl was added to the dye samples at the range of 5 50 g l the amount of all variables in the synthesized samples were prepared close to the corresponding extends reported for real reactive dye wastewaters in textile industries 2 3 reactor configuration and operation experimental set up fig 1 was conducted in two bench scale glass reactors with 2 5 m in high and 4 6 cm in inner diameter at the acco process the column packed with 2 6 l gac and 1 2 l dye solution whereas the o3 column was loaded with 2 5 l of the same solution ozone was generated by an ozone generator jahad research center iran with 5 0 0 2 g h capacity and oxygen feeding new life elite airsep co usa inlet ozone gas was continuously fed through a porous diffuser at the bottom of the reactors at constant flow rate of 1 5 l min providing constant ozone concentration of about 178 8 mg l the outlet ozone in the gas phase was quenched in a gas washing bottle filled by ki solution each ozonation run lasted 40 min and dye samples were withdrawn at specified time intervals from the reactors samples obtained from acco process were passed through a 0 45 μm millipore filters to remove gac particles merck kgaa darmstadt germany all samples were analyzed for color uv254 chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc nitrate and sulfate in acco the prepared solutions were respectively ozonized from low to high concentrations of the dye and nacl also after each run in acco the gac bed was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and partially dried by flowing air to prepare for the next run in order to identify the mechanism of rb194 reactions molecular or radical some experiments were performed in the presence of tba 1 100 m ratio of rb194 to tba as a radical scavenger to distinguish the impact of adsorption in acco process separate experiments were performed with aeration instead of ozonation moreover the effect of temperature on acco and o3 processes was examined by introducing the entire columns in a thermostatic water bath at 25 35 and 50 2 4 cod measurement in the presence of nacl cl is one of the inorganic substances that can interfere in cod measurement by reaction with potassium dichromate eq 5 41 5 6 c l c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 2 c r 3 3 c l 2 7 h 2 o to estimate the cod error rate in the saline environment the cod of a standard solution 150 mg l was measured at different nacl concentrations up to 1 beside salt free samples by the closed reflux colorimetric method as described by standard methods 42 cod digestion vials could neutralize chloride interference at nacl concentrations up to 0 05 by the contained mercuric sulfate the inconsistency among the measured cod values within the salty cod1 and salt free samples cod2 showed linear correlation r2 0 96 with the percentage of salinity according to eq 6 6 c o d 1 c o d 2 c o d 1 0 s 0 05 0 775 s 0 0161 s 0 05 then for cod determination in the samples the dye samples were diluted to salinity of lower than 1 although by this equation we were able to calculate the real amount of cod at the presence of nacl but further dilution in hypersaline samples could cause great errors so cod content was measured only in samples with moderate salinity nacl 27 5 g l 2 5 in situ regeneration of multi used gac feasibility of ozonation in regeneration of gac was investigated in acco so the acco reactor the gac used for treatment of about 132 liters of dye samples which is equal to 110 runs was filled with distilled water and ozonized for 10 h at inlet ozone gas concentration of 178 8 mg l in order to prevent re adsorption of the desorbed substances distilled water was refreshed every 2 hs once again the regenerated gac was applied in the acco 2 6 analytical methods reduction of rb194 was followed by measuring maximum absorption of wavelength at 600 nm and uv254 absorbance with a spectrophotometer optizen2120 uv plus mecasys co korea separate calibrations were performed for each process to offset the effect of filtration interference on color measurement nitrate and sulfate ions were measured according to the standard methods for water and wastewater examinations toc of samples after ozonation was measured to further evaluation of rb194 mineralization anatoc co germany the concentration of inlet and outlet ozone in the gaseous phase o 3 in and o 3 out were determined by adsorption in 2 ki solution with following titration against sodium thiosulfate the results were used to calculate the ozone utilization efficiency oue eq 7 7 ozon utilization efficiency o u e o 3 i n o 3 o u t o 3 o u t 100 the surface morphology and chemistry of gac were examined by sem using a philips xl30 electron microscope and ftir by a bruker tensor 27 spectrophotometer the textural properties of gac were appraised by nitrogen adsorption at 77 k belsorp mini ii japan the specific surface area total pore volume and mean pore diameter of gac were determined using bet analysis mesopore volume and external surface area were obtained using barret joyner halenda bjh method the total pore volume was determined by the amount of adsorbed liquid nitrogen at a relative pressure of 0 990 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nacl concentration on rb194 reduction the main objective of this study was to evaluate of the impact of salinity on color removal by acco and o3 from synthetic solutions then in a set of experiments the influence of nacl concentration from 5 to 50 g l was examined on the performance of acco and o3 at neutral ph and constant dye concentration of 200 mg l fig 2 a in acco the dye removal was slightly increased with increasing nacl concentration while in o3 process no significant differences were found in reduction of dye with increasing the salinity of samples o3 resulted in disappearance of about 85 of the initial dye at 5 min and complete color reduction were achieved in 10 min in acco after 5 min contact time color removal of 61 and 84 was obtained corresponding to the nacl concentrations of 5 and 50 g l respectively but complete color removal by o3 occurred after 20 min furthermore to discriminate the proportional contribution of oxidation and adsorption in the removal of color by acco some similar experiment were conducted with sole virgin gac fig 2 a a sharp decrease in color concentration at earlier reaction time could be attributed to the presence of a high amount of gac in the column it seems that rb194 has a relative high affinity toward gac but only about 45 of the initial dye concentration was disappeared after 40 min contact time therefore the role of gac by adsorption in the overall performance of acco process could not be ignored and the removal of color interacts with adsorption and oxidation mutually evaluation of the results showed that the disappearance of rb194 follows pseudo first order kinetic d c d t k c k min 1 is the apparent rate constant of rb194 removal that is attained by linear fitting of the plots of ln c c0 against time t the highest removal rate constant by acco 0 295 min 1 was measured at 50 g l of nacl that is 2 6 times higher than the value obtained at 5 g l of nacl fig 2a as was pointed out earlier cl converts ho to less reactive chlorine radicals cl2 cl and cloh that could participate at oxidation reactions more selectivity 8 43 these radicals show an excessive affinity for contaminants with electron rich functional groups which can offset the scavenging effect of cl 44 45 chromophoric azo bond of rb194 is an electron rich group which is more susceptible to direct electron transfer attack by chlorine radicals 46 thus at high salinity with greater amounts of produced chlorine radicals the chromophore band is broken off and the color is disappeared more rapidly 47 it is likely therefore that the nature and degradation mechanisms of contaminants are accountable for the different overall effect of cl also this phenomenon could be due to the aggregation of dye through compulsion by salt ions which increases adsorption rate of gac 48 at neutral ph the selective and fast attack of the molecular ozone into the dye chromophore causes decolorization over short periods of time it has been concluded that ozone attacks the chromophores of the dyes regardless of whether the dyes are in a synthetic solution or in a complicated wastewater matrix and the required ozone doses are almost equal 49 while faria et al 2009 50 found no major enhancement with activated carbon catalyzed ozonation compared to single ozonation in decolorization of different dye solutions our study showed that longer reaction time was for complete dye removal by acco process this discrepancy could be attributed to surface changes of gac during consecutive application in the acco process which will be discussed later to evaluate the treatment efficiencies of the processes uv254 absorbance variations by acco and o3 processes were plotted at different nacl concentrations fig 2b indeed uv254 absorbance is used as a surrogate for refractory olefins and aromatic compounds to evaluate the degradation of dye analysis of the results revealed that the data fitted pseudo second order kinetic at the both processes in acco uv254 abatement followed the similar trend as dye removal at different nacl concentrations and complete removal of aromatic fragments was achieved after 40 min chlorine radicals show tendency to react with olefinic compounds and aromatics rings substituted with methoxy hydroxy or amino groups 51 however in o3 process uv254 absorbance was decreased maximum 59 after 40 min and its removal was not affected by the salinity lower reduction of uv254 absorbance in o3 reveals that a fraction of intermediates is not prone to direct oxidation by ozone then complete removal of aromatic moieties by acco can be attributed to the synergistic effects of ozone and gac 3 2 effect of initial ph on rb194 degradation the scavenging act of cl highly depends on ph and increasing in ph may reciprocate it 52 therefore the simultaneous impact of both salinity and ph were investigated on the removal efficiency of acco at semi acidic ph 5 neutral ph 7 and alkaline ph 12 phs fig 3 a since salinity did not affect the o3 process the effect of ph in this process was only evaluated in one salinity 27 5 g l in acco dye removal rate maximized at semi acidic ph and nacl concentration of 50 g l k 0 3465 min 1 although ho reacts rapidly with cl and produces cloh cl formation is only significant at low ph 53 at acidic condition cloh is rapidly converted to cl and then to cl2 through the protonation reactions 44 cloh is always remarked as a radical having lower oxidation capability than cl2 or cl whereas cl reacts with pollutants via similar rate constants to those of cl2 54 under those circumstances cl2 and cl should be the main chlorine containing radical rather than cloh contributing to the degradation of target pollutant in the acco system in the existence of cl thereupon accelerating effect of cl could be more favorable at acidic ph to specify ho participation in the reaction mechanism of the acco degradation of rb194 was evaluated using tba at nacl concentration of 27 5 g l rb194 average removal in the presence of the tba was decreased about 12 at ph 5 and 12 respectively while the performance of the system was stable at neutral ph then at neutral ph the reaction is driven by cloh radicals since the rate constant of the ho with cl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 is greater than that with tba 6 108 m 1s 1 55 rb194 with high affinity to the chlorine radicals rapidly consumes them and prevents the possibility of the reverse reaction of ho with cl the formation of cl radicals in acidic medium is also proved by the reduction of process efficiency because tba has the property of removing cl radicals but does not affect cl2 radicals due to the freezing of the reaction of ho with cl in alkaline ph the decrease in the rb194 removal at the presence of tba indicates that the ho radicals are responsible for color degradation in o3 process alkaline ph promoted formation of ho eqs 9 11 56 which leads to decrease in k because ho is less selective than molecular ozone in attacking to the chromophore 57 of note based on the negative effect of tba on color removal the possible oxidation via ho at this ph ph 12 could be proved 9 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 10 o 3 h o 2 o h 2 o 3 11 o 3 h 2 o o h o 2 o h in the evaluation of uv254 absorbance abatement by acco and o3 a clear advantage of alkaline ph could be identified fig 3b for all that ho failed to break down the chromophores it did better in degradation of refractory aromatic compounds that mainly responsible for uv254 absorption fig 3c shows that ozone is less effective in cod removal at acidic ph due to reaction of cl with ozone according to following equations 58 59 12 o 3 c l o 2 c l o 13 2 h c l c l o c l 2 h 2 o 14 c l 2 h 2 o h c l h o c l it is supposed that these free chloride species can react with unsaturated bonds of organics intermediates and leading to formation of halogenated organic compounds aox that contribute in the amount of residual cod 60 due to the low concentration of ho in neutral ph the probability of generating chlorine species and thus producing aox is low although due to the hydrophobic nature of the aox they could be rapidly decomposed by molecular ozone 61 62 in acco although more ho radicals are formed under alkaline condition but the residual cod value was more than that for either neutral or acidic conditions due to the generation of more intermediates at alkaline condition 63 64 3 3 correlation of uv254 absorbance abatement with color and cod removal correlations of uv254 abatement with color and cod removal at different ph values and mediate saline samples 27 5 g l nacl are shown in fig 4 a and b uv254 absorbance reduction was highly correlated with color removal at both acco r2 0 97 and o3 r2 0 85 processes however linear correlation between cod and uv254 removal was not significant in both acco and o3 at ph 12 and 5 respectively such behavior may owe to the predominance of ho radicals in acco at ph 12 and cl2 and hocl in o3 at ph 5 overall the results demonstrated that acco more efficiently reduced uv254 absorbance color and cod in saline environment 3 4 effect of temperature the effect of temperature was examined on color and uv254 absorbance reduction cod removal and ozone utilization rate fig 5 ozone is more stable and soluble and efficiently transferred at low temperature while upper temperatures demonstrates higher ozone decomposition and ho generation rates 65 67 the result exhibited that upper temperature promoted color and aromaticity reduction and cod removal in acco process higher temperature increases the diffusion of dye molecules and improves of their movement into the gac pores giannakoudakis et al 2016 showed that increase in temperature of solution from 25 to 65 c was associated with the greater absorption capacity of reactive black 5 into the gac pores 68 also in o3 reactor the color and uv254 elimination displayed a similar increasing trend at higher temperatures but the amount of residual cod increased even by 20 at 50 c it could be concluded that refractory organic substances which cannot be measured with cod analysis might be decomposed by ho radicals to the cod detectable organics 69 also increase in the reaction rate of cl with generated ho radicals might lead to the formation of aox in elevated temperatures the addition of chlorine radicals to the aromatic ring with oh and nh2 electron donating groups of rb194 could lead to the generation of chlorinated aromatic intermediates rather than mineralization 47 70 fig 5d shows oue in acco and o3 at 25 and 50 the oue of acco at 25 remained constant at about 99 over the time however in o3 reactor it was 94 in the first minutes and decreased to 74 over the time the introduction of reactors to 50 water bath decreased oue for both processes this result may be explained by the fact that the solubility of ozone would reduce with elevated temperature resulting to the reduction of ozone mass transfer 65 66 overall the catalyzed ozonation have advantage of higher color degradation than single ozonation since the dyeing wastewater commonly has high temperatures 3 5 determination of rb194 mineralization rate the trend of toc removal for dye concentration of 65 mg l and at neutral ph and salinity of 5 g l is presented in fig 6 a in o3 process the amount of toc decreased by 38 after 20 min contact time and did not change much afterward however in acco process in the first minutes of the reaction 58 of the toc was declined and followed an upward trend resulting in a slight increase in the toc content perhaps the degradation of dye has attributed to the formation of refractory intermediates especially aox rather than complete degradation 71 also ozonation of gac may release soluble organics into the bulk solution and leads to an increase in toc amount ozonation increases oxygen containing groups on gac surface that can be attacked by ozone and release toc it has been reported that heat treated carbon nanotubes with low oxygen groups could show lower toc release 72 the concentration profiles of the nitrate and sulfate ions built up owing to the mineralization of rb194 are shown in fig 6b and c the concentration of these ions increased in acco process at the first minute of the reaction and then remained constant in o3 process a progressive trend was observed for the anions and resulted significant difference at alkaline ph probably due to the shift of oxidants to ho radicals production of the higher concentrations of nitrate in both processes could be suggested by the cleavage of heterocyclic nitrogen and dissociation of sulfonic acid groups in rb194 3 6 vitality and regeneration of gac the robustness of gac was investigated after 85 normal distinctive runs by re examination of samples with similar dye concentration fig 7 at the startup of acco color removal efficiency of 94 was obtained for 65 mg l of rb194 at salinity of 5 g l and acidic ph at 5 min contact time but color removal efficiency of the same sample dropped by 24 after 65 run then the multi used gac bed was regenerated with ozone the regenerated gac demonstrated color removal efficiency of 88 for the same sample surface properties of gac used in acco were investigated by ftir spectra fig 8 the ftir spectra displayed similar shapes in various peak intensity with three principle broad bands at around 3740 1550 and 1092 cm 1 which could be credited to the stretching vibrations of oh cc or co and co bonds respectively 73 75 the result could be attributed to o3 induced gasification of some carbon atoms in the carbon skeleton of gac that are transformed to surface oxygen functional groups the ozone regeneration process may go through the formation of hydroxyl radicals which subsequently initiate the oxidation reaction and introduce a large amount of oxygen containing surface complexes on the surface of activated carbon also o3 induced reactions may involve the direct reaction route of o3 with the cc bond for cooh formation the presence of these oxygen functional groups demonstrates an acidic and hydrophilic nature of the gac where also dye molecules might be anchored 73 76 77 unlike to the regenerated gac the multi used gac showed a slight difference in ftir features in comparison with the virgin one scavenging of oh by cl inhibits the oxidation of surface groups that could prevent the inactivation of the gac through change in surface chemistry then textural alteration of gac was investigated that was presented in the following paragraphs the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms for the virgin and ozonized gac are presented in fig 9 a as stated by the iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry classification the isotherm curves for ozonized gac were regarded as a hybrid type of i and iv with narrow hysteresis loops of h2 type over the p p0 range of 0 6 1 0 which were the geometry of narrow ink bottle mesopore suggesting the pore blocking effect 78 as shown in fig 9b ozonation had a significant effect on the pore shapes slit shape of mesopores of the virgin gac regarding the different isotherm curve type iv and the shape of hysteresis loops h4 regeneration of gac by ozone could oxidize carbon atoms in the carbon skeleton that are transformed to the surface oxygen functional groups some textural and porosity properties of gac samples calculated from physisorption of nitrogen data at 77 k are shown in table 2 in multi used gac specific surface area reduced about 223 55 m2 g in comparison with the virgin gac and regeneration did not significantly recover it the reduction in bet surface area could be an outcome of two factors 1 damage of the pore structure and probable blocking of the pores entry and or 2 adsorption of contaminants intermediates into the pores these results confirm the findings of surface morphological images by sem in which a uniform spherical pores of ozonized gac are displayed that have a hive like pattern fig 10 a and b in the regenerated gac the total mesopore volume was increased dramatically and then the mean pore diameter has briefly decreased the probability collapse of adjacent pore walls that reported in many studies could not be seen and the gac has not been damaged during ozonation fig 10c implies that the virgin gac with fuzzy surface and arbitrary heterogeneous pores have been converted into circular or oval pores with ozonation also fig 10d indicates successful adsorption of the dye all special architecture of the gac samples are also consistent with the results were shown of bjh pore size distribution fig 9b and nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig 9a higher activity of the regenerated acidified gac by the oxygen functional groups than the multi used gac with taking into account the unmarked expand of the surface area by regeneration may be due to the change in surface chemical properties although basic sites of carbonic catalysts are recognized as initiators of ozone decomposition but acidic surface groups on regenerated gac could have effective role in catalytic ozonation cao et al 2014 found that acidic surface group on gac remarkably did better than the basic sites in the degradation of oxalic acid using ozone 79 some of the acid functional groups like phenolic groups can produce h2o2 ho2 or ho2 o2 via reaction with ozone 80 these species diffuse to the bulk solution with a longer lifetime and generate ho in the radical type series reaction of ozone decay 79 also hydrophilic surface of regenerated gac could result in enhanced elimination of adsorbed hydrophilic rb194 through the surface catalytic reaction fan et al 2014 showed that atrazine with hydrophobic nature was associated with reduced absorption capacity on ozonized multi walled carbon nanotubes 81 the increased electrophilic reaction between ozone and the negatively charged gac ph phpzc also can be accounted for a higher removal rate of dye through oxidation in bulk solution 79 some deactivation of catalytic activity could be related to the failure of ozonation in cut out of the whole adsorbates from the gac surface and or strong electrostatic force between negatively charged gac and the anionic reactive dyes ph phpzc of note aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids the intermediates formed in the ozonation of aromatic compounds or aox adsorbed on gac surface could hardly diffuse from gac surface to the bulk solution due to their hydrophobic and non polar nature 82 4 conclusions this study was set out to determine the impact of chloride ions on removal of rb194 by acco and o3 processes in sole ozonation increasing of nacl concentration showed negligible effect on dye removal whereas enhanced the color removal efficiency by acco such better color removal correlated with the production of chlorine radicals which contribute to the dye bleaching via high selectivity towards electron rich constitutes moreover acidic condition significantly enhanced the performance of the acco at high salinity due to higher yield of chlorine radicals in the process uv254 absorbance reduction was also used as a simple surrogate parameter to evaluate the degradation of the dye elimination of uv254 absorbance was directly proportional to the amount of color and cod removal at the both processes but acco more effectively mitigated uv254 absorbance than single ozonation the results revealed an overall downtrend in performance of acco after 68 runs however color removal was enhanced by using the ozone regenerated gac and the efficiency was almost closer to the virgin gac the more provided oxygen functional groups by ozone at the surface of the regenerated gac afforded hydrophilic nature for adsorption of dye molecules and enhanced the catalytic activity of gac then acco could be considered as a promising technology for color removal from saline textile wastewater declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have

26 ni containing layered double hydroxide nanocatalyst 27 silica supported cu 28 zinc slag waste 29 or acid activated clays 30 in different aqueous solutions but there is still insufficient information with the effect of cl on dye mineralization mechanisms in catalytic ozonation catalytic ozonation is expanded to dominate the limitations of single ozonation e g inefficient treatment of saturated organic compounds through promoting ho generation and decreasing ozone consumption 31 32 among the various catalysts activated carbon ac has attracted a great deal of notice because of its wide availability low cost no metal leaching and high porous surface area 33 34 activated carbon catalyzed ozonation acco could improve oxidation of organic compounds through initiating promoting role of ac in the radical type chain reactions of ozone decomposition and formation of ho 35 36 furthermore this technique provides the benefit of continuous reactions of oxidizing agents with adsorbed compounds on ac 37 however there is increasing concern over the stability and reusability of ac previous studies revealed that ac offer poor catalytic stabilities owing to the changes in the surface chemistry and masking of active sites by degradation intermediates 38 39 although the stability of ac has been surveyed in some batch studies however few cycles tests cannot be decisive in the determination of the longevity of a catalyst after all probable depletion of adsorption sites can be achieved by in situ facile scalable and cost effectiveness ozone regeneration then to address the aforementioned disparities a pilot scale acco process in comparison with single ozonation were used to investigate the effect of various cl concentration on the degradation of reactive blue 194 rb194 dye in addition cl impact on the dye removal and mineralization was evaluated at different ph values and temperatures then in the second phase the stability of ac over the long term of trials and regeneration efficiency by ozonation were examined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and morphological textural analyses by scanning electron microscopy sem and brunauer emmett teller bet 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents rb194 containing 40 sodium sulfate ohyoung co south korea was provided via a local textile company the main characteristics of the dye are presented in table 1 bituminous coal based granular activated carbon gac was obtained from jacobi carbons co sweden aquasorb 101 8 30 mesh particle size and 864 1 m2 g bet surface area and it was used as received all other analytical grade chemicals and reagents used in the experiments including nacl and tert butyl alcohol tba were purchased from merck 2 2 preparation of synthetic dye solutions reactive dyes are found in hydrolyzed form in textile dyeing wastewater then the hydrolyzed stock solutions 6000 mg l were prepared according to the procedure used by pereira et al 2003 40 the different concentrations of rb194 10 200 mg l were prepared from this solution using double distilled water and the intended ph was adjusted either by sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide nacl was added to the dye samples at the range of 5 50 g l the amount of all variables in the synthesized samples were prepared close to the corresponding extends reported for real reactive dye wastewaters in textile industries 2 3 reactor configuration and operation experimental set up fig 1 was conducted in two bench scale glass reactors with 2 5 m in high and 4 6 cm in inner diameter at the acco process the column packed with 2 6 l gac and 1 2 l dye solution whereas the o3 column was loaded with 2 5 l of the same solution ozone was generated by an ozone generator jahad research center iran with 5 0 0 2 g h capacity and oxygen feeding new life elite airsep co usa inlet ozone gas was continuously fed through a porous diffuser at the bottom of the reactors at constant flow rate of 1 5 l min providing constant ozone concentration of about 178 8 mg l the outlet ozone in the gas phase was quenched in a gas washing bottle filled by ki solution each ozonation run lasted 40 min and dye samples were withdrawn at specified time intervals from the reactors samples obtained from acco process were passed through a 0 45 μm millipore filters to remove gac particles merck kgaa darmstadt germany all samples were analyzed for color uv254 chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc nitrate and sulfate in acco the prepared solutions were respectively ozonized from low to high concentrations of the dye and nacl also after each run in acco the gac bed was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and partially dried by flowing air to prepare for the next run in order to identify the mechanism of rb194 reactions molecular or radical some experiments were performed in the presence of tba 1 100 m ratio of rb194 to tba as a radical scavenger to distinguish the impact of adsorption in acco process separate experiments were performed with aeration instead of ozonation moreover the effect of temperature on acco and o3 processes was examined by introducing the entire columns in a thermostatic water bath at 25 35 and 50 2 4 cod measurement in the presence of nacl cl is one of the inorganic substances that can interfere in cod measurement by reaction with potassium dichromate eq 5 41 5 6 c l c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 2 c r 3 3 c l 2 7 h 2 o to estimate the cod error rate in the saline environment the cod of a standard solution 150 mg l was measured at different nacl concentrations up to 1 beside salt free samples by the closed reflux colorimetric method as described by standard methods 42 cod digestion vials could neutralize chloride interference at nacl concentrations up to 0 05 by the contained mercuric sulfate the inconsistency among the measured cod values within the salty cod1 and salt free samples cod2 showed linear correlation r2 0 96 with the percentage of salinity according to eq 6 6 c o d 1 c o d 2 c o d 1 0 s 0 05 0 775 s 0 0161 s 0 05 then for cod determination in the samples the dye samples were diluted to salinity of lower than 1 although by this equation we were able to calculate the real amount of cod at the presence of nacl but further dilution in hypersaline samples could cause great errors so cod content was measured only in samples with moderate salinity nacl 27 5 g l 2 5 in situ regeneration of multi used gac feasibility of ozonation in regeneration of gac was investigated in acco so the acco reactor the gac used for treatment of about 132 liters of dye samples which is equal to 110 runs was filled with distilled water and ozonized for 10 h at inlet ozone gas concentration of 178 8 mg l in order to prevent re adsorption of the desorbed substances distilled water was refreshed every 2 hs once again the regenerated gac was applied in the acco 2 6 analytical methods reduction of rb194 was followed by measuring maximum absorption of wavelength at 600 nm and uv254 absorbance with a spectrophotometer optizen2120 uv plus mecasys co korea separate calibrations were performed for each process to offset the effect of filtration interference on color measurement nitrate and sulfate ions were measured according to the standard methods for water and wastewater examinations toc of samples after ozonation was measured to further evaluation of rb194 mineralization anatoc co germany the concentration of inlet and outlet ozone in the gaseous phase o 3 in and o 3 out were determined by adsorption in 2 ki solution with following titration against sodium thiosulfate the results were used to calculate the ozone utilization efficiency oue eq 7 7 ozon utilization efficiency o u e o 3 i n o 3 o u t o 3 o u t 100 the surface morphology and chemistry of gac were examined by sem using a philips xl30 electron microscope and ftir by a bruker tensor 27 spectrophotometer the textural properties of gac were appraised by nitrogen adsorption at 77 k belsorp mini ii japan the specific surface area total pore volume and mean pore diameter of gac were determined using bet analysis mesopore volume and external surface area were obtained using barret joyner halenda bjh method the total pore volume was determined by the amount of adsorbed liquid nitrogen at a relative pressure of 0 990 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nacl concentration on rb194 reduction the main objective of this study was to evaluate of the impact of salinity on color removal by acco and o3 from synthetic solutions then in a set of experiments the influence of nacl concentration from 5 to 50 g l was examined on the performance of acco and o3 at neutral ph and constant dye concentration of 200 mg l fig 2 a in acco the dye removal was slightly increased with increasing nacl concentration while in o3 process no significant differences were found in reduction of dye with increasing the salinity of samples o3 resulted in disappearance of about 85 of the initial dye at 5 min and complete color reduction were achieved in 10 min in acco after 5 min contact time color removal of 61 and 84 was obtained corresponding to the nacl concentrations of 5 and 50 g l respectively but complete color removal by o3 occurred after 20 min furthermore to discriminate the proportional contribution of oxidation and adsorption in the removal of color by acco some similar experiment were conducted with sole virgin gac fig 2 a a sharp decrease in color concentration at earlier reaction time could be attributed to the presence of a high amount of gac in the column it seems that rb194 has a relative high affinity toward gac but only about 45 of the initial dye concentration was disappeared after 40 min contact time therefore the role of gac by adsorption in the overall performance of acco process could not be ignored and the removal of color interacts with adsorption and oxidation mutually evaluation of the results showed that the disappearance of rb194 follows pseudo first order kinetic d c d t k c k min 1 is the apparent rate constant of rb194 removal that is attained by linear fitting of the plots of ln c c0 against time t the highest removal rate constant by acco 0 295 min 1 was measured at 50 g l of nacl that is 2 6 times higher than the value obtained at 5 g l of nacl fig 2a as was pointed out earlier cl converts ho to less reactive chlorine radicals cl2 cl and cloh that could participate at oxidation reactions more selectivity 8 43 these radicals show an excessive affinity for contaminants with electron rich functional groups which can offset the scavenging effect of cl 44 45 chromophoric azo bond of rb194 is an electron rich group which is more susceptible to direct electron transfer attack by chlorine radicals 46 thus at high salinity with greater amounts of produced chlorine radicals the chromophore band is broken off and the color is disappeared more rapidly 47 it is likely therefore that the nature and degradation mechanisms of contaminants are accountable for the different overall effect of cl also this phenomenon could be due to the aggregation of dye through compulsion by salt ions which increases adsorption rate of gac 48 at neutral ph the selective and fast attack of the molecular ozone into the dye chromophore causes decolorization over short periods of time it has been concluded that ozone attacks the chromophores of the dyes regardless of whether the dyes are in a synthetic solution or in a complicated wastewater matrix and the required ozone doses are almost equal 49 while faria et al 2009 50 found no major enhancement with activated carbon catalyzed ozonation compared to single ozonation in decolorization of different dye solutions our study showed that longer reaction time was for complete dye removal by acco process this discrepancy could be attributed to surface changes of gac during consecutive application in the acco process which will be discussed later to evaluate the treatment efficiencies of the processes uv254 absorbance variations by acco and o3 processes were plotted at different nacl concentrations fig 2b indeed uv254 absorbance is used as a surrogate for refractory olefins and aromatic compounds to evaluate the degradation of dye analysis of the results revealed that the data fitted pseudo second order kinetic at the both processes in acco uv254 abatement followed the similar trend as dye removal at different nacl concentrations and complete removal of aromatic fragments was achieved after 40 min chlorine radicals show tendency to react with olefinic compounds and aromatics rings substituted with methoxy hydroxy or amino groups 51 however in o3 process uv254 absorbance was decreased maximum 59 after 40 min and its removal was not affected by the salinity lower reduction of uv254 absorbance in o3 reveals that a fraction of intermediates is not prone to direct oxidation by ozone then complete removal of aromatic moieties by acco can be attributed to the synergistic effects of ozone and gac 3 2 effect of initial ph on rb194 degradation the scavenging act of cl highly depends on ph and increasing in ph may reciprocate it 52 therefore the simultaneous impact of both salinity and ph were investigated on the removal efficiency of acco at semi acidic ph 5 neutral ph 7 and alkaline ph 12 phs fig 3 a since salinity did not affect the o3 process the effect of ph in this process was only evaluated in one salinity 27 5 g l in acco dye removal rate maximized at semi acidic ph and nacl concentration of 50 g l k 0 3465 min 1 although ho reacts rapidly with cl and produces cloh cl formation is only significant at low ph 53 at acidic condition cloh is rapidly converted to cl and then to cl2 through the protonation reactions 44 cloh is always remarked as a radical having lower oxidation capability than cl2 or cl whereas cl reacts with pollutants via similar rate constants to those of cl2 54 under those circumstances cl2 and cl should be the main chlorine containing radical rather than cloh contributing to the degradation of target pollutant in the acco system in the existence of cl thereupon accelerating effect of cl could be more favorable at acidic ph to specify ho participation in the reaction mechanism of the acco degradation of rb194 was evaluated using tba at nacl concentration of 27 5 g l rb194 average removal in the presence of the tba was decreased about 12 at ph 5 and 12 respectively while the performance of the system was stable at neutral ph then at neutral ph the reaction is driven by cloh radicals since the rate constant of the ho with cl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 is greater than that with tba 6 108 m 1s 1 55 rb194 with high affinity to the chlorine radicals rapidly consumes them and prevents the possibility of the reverse reaction of ho with cl the formation of cl radicals in acidic medium is also proved by the reduction of process efficiency because tba has the property of removing cl radicals but does not affect cl2 radicals due to the freezing of the reaction of ho with cl in alkaline ph the decrease in the rb194 removal at the presence of tba indicates that the ho radicals are responsible for color degradation in o3 process alkaline ph promoted formation of ho eqs 9 11 56 which leads to decrease in k because ho is less selective than molecular ozone in attacking to the chromophore 57 of note based on the negative effect of tba on color removal the possible oxidation via ho at this ph ph 12 could be proved 9 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 10 o 3 h o 2 o h 2 o 3 11 o 3 h 2 o o h o 2 o h in the evaluation of uv254 absorbance abatement by acco and o3 a clear advantage of alkaline ph could be identified fig 3b for all that ho failed to break down the chromophores it did better in degradation of refractory aromatic compounds that mainly responsible for uv254 absorption fig 3c shows that ozone is less effective in cod removal at acidic ph due to reaction of cl with ozone according to following equations 58 59 12 o 3 c l o 2 c l o 13 2 h c l c l o c l 2 h 2 o 14 c l 2 h 2 o h c l h o c l it is supposed that these free chloride species can react with unsaturated bonds of organics intermediates and leading to formation of halogenated organic compounds aox that contribute in the amount of residual cod 60 due to the low concentration of ho in neutral ph the probability of generating chlorine species and thus producing aox is low although due to the hydrophobic nature of the aox they could be rapidly decomposed by molecular ozone 61 62 in acco although more ho radicals are formed under alkaline condition but the residual cod value was more than that for either neutral or acidic conditions due to the generation of more intermediates at alkaline condition 63 64 3 3 correlation of uv254 absorbance abatement with color and cod removal correlations of uv254 abatement with color and cod removal at different ph values and mediate saline samples 27 5 g l nacl are shown in fig 4 a and b uv254 absorbance reduction was highly correlated with color removal at both acco r2 0 97 and o3 r2 0 85 processes however linear correlation between cod and uv254 removal was not significant in both acco and o3 at ph 12 and 5 respectively such behavior may owe to the predominance of ho radicals in acco at ph 12 and cl2 and hocl in o3 at ph 5 overall the results demonstrated that acco more efficiently reduced uv254 absorbance color and cod in saline environment 3 4 effect of temperature the effect of temperature was examined on color and uv254 absorbance reduction cod removal and ozone utilization rate fig 5 ozone is more stable and soluble and efficiently transferred at low temperature while upper temperatures demonstrates higher ozone decomposition and ho generation rates 65 67 the result exhibited that upper temperature promoted color and aromaticity reduction and cod removal in acco process higher temperature increases the diffusion of dye molecules and improves of their movement into the gac pores giannakoudakis et al 2016 showed that increase in temperature of solution from 25 to 65 c was associated with the greater absorption capacity of reactive black 5 into the gac pores 68 also in o3 reactor the color and uv254 elimination displayed a similar increasing trend at higher temperatures but the amount of residual cod increased even by 20 at 50 c it could be concluded that refractory organic substances which cannot be measured with cod analysis might be decomposed by ho radicals to the cod detectable organics 69 also increase in the reaction rate of cl with generated ho radicals might lead to the formation of aox in elevated temperatures the addition of chlorine radicals to the aromatic ring with oh and nh2 electron donating groups of rb194 could lead to the generation of chlorinated aromatic intermediates rather than mineralization 47 70 fig 5d shows oue in acco and o3 at 25 and 50 the oue of acco at 25 remained constant at about 99 over the time however in o3 reactor it was 94 in the first minutes and decreased to 74 over the time the introduction of reactors to 50 water bath decreased oue for both processes this result may be explained by the fact that the solubility of ozone would reduce with elevated temperature resulting to the reduction of ozone mass transfer 65 66 overall the catalyzed ozonation have advantage of higher color degradation than single ozonation since the dyeing wastewater commonly has high temperatures 3 5 determination of rb194 mineralization rate the trend of toc removal for dye concentration of 65 mg l and at neutral ph and salinity of 5 g l is presented in fig 6 a in o3 process the amount of toc decreased by 38 after 20 min contact time and did not change much afterward however in acco process in the first minutes of the reaction 58 of the toc was declined and followed an upward trend resulting in a slight increase in the toc content perhaps the degradation of dye has attributed to the formation of refractory intermediates especially aox rather than complete degradation 71 also ozonation of gac may release soluble organics into the bulk solution and leads to an increase in toc amount ozonation increases oxygen containing groups on gac surface that can be attacked by ozone and release toc it has been reported that heat treated carbon nanotubes with low oxygen groups could show lower toc release 72 the concentration profiles of the nitrate and sulfate ions built up owing to the mineralization of rb194 are shown in fig 6b and c the concentration of these ions increased in acco process at the first minute of the reaction and then remained constant in o3 process a progressive trend was observed for the anions and resulted significant difference at alkaline ph probably due to the shift of oxidants to ho radicals production of the higher concentrations of nitrate in both processes could be suggested by the cleavage of heterocyclic nitrogen and dissociation of sulfonic acid groups in rb194 3 6 vitality and regeneration of gac the robustness of gac was investigated after 85 normal distinctive runs by re examination of samples with similar dye concentration fig 7 at the startup of acco color removal efficiency of 94 was obtained for 65 mg l of rb194 at salinity of 5 g l and acidic ph at 5 min contact time but color removal efficiency of the same sample dropped by 24 after 65 run then the multi used gac bed was regenerated with ozone the regenerated gac demonstrated color removal efficiency of 88 for the same sample surface properties of gac used in acco were investigated by ftir spectra fig 8 the ftir spectra displayed similar shapes in various peak intensity with three principle broad bands at around 3740 1550 and 1092 cm 1 which could be credited to the stretching vibrations of oh cc or co and co bonds respectively 73 75 the result could be attributed to o3 induced gasification of some carbon atoms in the carbon skeleton of gac that are transformed to surface oxygen functional groups the ozone regeneration process may go through the formation of hydroxyl radicals which subsequently initiate the oxidation reaction and introduce a large amount of oxygen containing surface complexes on the surface of activated carbon also o3 induced reactions may involve the direct reaction route of o3 with the cc bond for cooh formation the presence of these oxygen functional groups demonstrates an acidic and hydrophilic nature of the gac where also dye molecules might be anchored 73 76 77 unlike to the regenerated gac the multi used gac showed a slight difference in ftir features in comparison with the virgin one scavenging of oh by cl inhibits the oxidation of surface groups that could prevent the inactivation of the gac through change in surface chemistry then textural alteration of gac was investigated that was presented in the following paragraphs the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms for the virgin and ozonized gac are presented in fig 9 a as stated by the iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry classification the isotherm curves for ozonized gac were regarded as a hybrid type of i and iv with narrow hysteresis loops of h2 type over the p p0 range of 0 6 1 0 which were the geometry of narrow ink bottle mesopore suggesting the pore blocking effect 78 as shown in fig 9b ozonation had a significant effect on the pore shapes slit shape of mesopores of the virgin gac regarding the different isotherm curve type iv and the shape of hysteresis loops h4 regeneration of gac by ozone could oxidize carbon atoms in the carbon skeleton that are transformed to the surface oxygen functional groups some textural and porosity properties of gac samples calculated from physisorption of nitrogen data at 77 k are shown in table 2 in multi used gac specific surface area reduced about 223 55 m2 g in comparison with the virgin gac and regeneration did not significantly recover it the reduction in bet surface area could be an outcome of two factors 1 damage of the pore structure and probable blocking of the pores entry and or 2 adsorption of contaminants intermediates into the pores these results confirm the findings of surface morphological images by sem in which a uniform spherical pores of ozonized gac are displayed that have a hive like pattern fig 10 a and b in the regenerated gac the total mesopore volume was increased dramatically and then the mean pore diameter has briefly decreased the probability collapse of adjacent pore walls that reported in many studies could not be seen and the gac has not been damaged during ozonation fig 10c implies that the virgin gac with fuzzy surface and arbitrary heterogeneous pores have been converted into circular or oval pores with ozonation also fig 10d indicates successful adsorption of the dye all special architecture of the gac samples are also consistent with the results were shown of bjh pore size distribution fig 9b and nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig 9a higher activity of the regenerated acidified gac by the oxygen functional groups than the multi used gac with taking into account the unmarked expand of the surface area by regeneration may be due to the change in surface chemical properties although basic sites of carbonic catalysts are recognized as initiators of ozone decomposition but acidic surface groups on regenerated gac could have effective role in catalytic ozonation cao et al 2014 found that acidic surface group on gac remarkably did better than the basic sites in the degradation of oxalic acid using ozone 79 some of the acid functional groups like phenolic groups can produce h2o2 ho2 or ho2 o2 via reaction with ozone 80 these species diffuse to the bulk solution with a longer lifetime and generate ho in the radical type series reaction of ozone decay 79 also hydrophilic surface of regenerated gac could result in enhanced elimination of adsorbed hydrophilic rb194 through the surface catalytic reaction fan et al 2014 showed that atrazine with hydrophobic nature was associated with reduced absorption capacity on ozonized multi walled carbon nanotubes 81 the increased electrophilic reaction between ozone and the negatively charged gac ph phpzc also can be accounted for a higher removal rate of dye through oxidation in bulk solution 79 some deactivation of catalytic activity could be related to the failure of ozonation in cut out of the whole adsorbates from the gac surface and or strong electrostatic force between negatively charged gac and the anionic reactive dyes ph phpzc of note aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids the intermediates formed in the ozonation of aromatic compounds or aox adsorbed on gac surface could hardly diffuse from gac surface to the bulk solution due to their hydrophobic and non polar nature 82 4 conclusions this study was set out to determine the impact of chloride ions on removal of rb194 by acco and o3 processes in sole ozonation increasing of nacl concentration showed negligible effect on dye removal whereas enhanced the color removal efficiency by acco such better color removal correlated with the production of chlorine radicals which contribute to the dye bleaching via high selectivity towards electron rich constitutes moreover acidic condition significantly enhanced the performance of the acco at high salinity due to higher yield of chlorine radicals in the process uv254 absorbance reduction was also used as a simple surrogate parameter to evaluate the degradation of the dye elimination of uv254 absorbance was directly proportional to the amount of color and cod removal at the both processes but acco more effectively mitigated uv254 absorbance than single ozonation the results revealed an overall downtrend in performance of acco after 68 runs however color removal was enhanced by using the ozone regenerated gac and the efficiency was almost closer to the virgin gac the more provided oxygen functional groups by ozone at the surface of the regenerated gac afforded hydrophilic nature for adsorption of dye molecules and enhanced the catalytic activity of gac then acco could be considered as a promising technology for color removal from saline textile wastewater declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have

14043,in the present research electrocoagulation ec process was applied as a selected pretreatment to evaluate its effectiveness and operating cost regarding simultaneous calcium and turbidity removal in order to mitigate the scaling and colloidal fouling potential of reverse osmosis ro technology the effects of the main parameters namely initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on ec process were assessed and optimized by employing response surface methodology rsm a reasonable correlation between the experimental and predicted data was found through analysis of variance anova the highest calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies of 36 and 93 5 respectively and the minimal operating cost of 1 58 us m3 were obtained at the optimum time of 35 5 min and current density of 3 85 ma cm2 with the selected constant initial calcium concentration of 250 mg l and initial turbidity of 85 ntu in the present study the applicability of two pretreatments including hybrid ec filtration and filtration only to ro membrane fouling was also compared the ro recovery of the hybrid ec filtration pretreatment improved about 25 in comparison to that of the filtration only pretreatment which demonstrated the effective capability of the ec process in scaling and colloidal fouling mitigation keywords electrocoagulation reverse osmosis calcium and turbidity removal response surface methodology optimization 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro as a cost effective membrane process in comparison to other desalination technologies has faced with the restrictive problem of fouling 1 4 membrane fouling causes a decline in permeate flux and an increase in feed pressure consequently it results in higher operating and maintenance costs due to greater energy consumption and membrane cleaning replacement 2 5 7 fouling which results from the accumulation of inorganic or organic materials on the surface or in the pores of a membrane could be categorized into scaling as well as organic colloidal and biological fouling 4 8 9 the presence of calcium ions in feed water can increase the potential of membrane scaling due to the precipitation of low solubility salts especially caco3 and caso4 2h2o 10 colloidal and suspended matters might also form a cake layer on the membrane surface which increases the hydraulic resistance of the membrane 11 turbidity must be less than 1 ntu in ro feed water for prevention of colloidal fouling 3 8 to enhance the quality of ro feed water appropriate pretreatments should be considered the conventional approaches for reduction of scaling and colloidal fouling involve injecting antiscalants adding acid control of calcium carbonate precipitation softening with ion exchange chemical precipitation lime and soda ash and coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation and filtration 9 12 16 increased risk of ro membrane biofouling due to phosphate based antiscalants consumption 3 13 utilization of high amounts of acids salts generation of brine solutions and the requirement for disposal of a large volume of sludge are the demerits of the mentioned treatment technologies 12 16 17 electrocoagulation ec as a promising pretreatment has been proven to be effective in the removal of various types of pollutants to reduce ro membrane fouling 2 10 13 researchers have focused on ec process due to the absence of chemicals less sludge production versatility simplicity of operation compact size and low investment and operating costs 10 18 20 several studies have investigated the capability of ec to remove hardness 13 21 24 and turbidity 25 27 separately however on the basis of our literature review only zhao et al 10 explored ec performance in simultaneous hardness turbidity and cod removal from a specific produced water to enhance the ro feed water the performance of ec and its operating cost in the treatment of various solutions containing both hardness and turbidity have not been investigated so far furthermore in most of the conducted studies the impact of ec pretreatment on ro fouling was evaluated by comparing ec pretreated water and the raw water to the best of our knowledge the effects of the hybrid ec filtration and filtration only pretreatments on ro performance have not been compared therefore the principal aim of this work is to assess the efficiency and operating cost of the ec process as an alternative pretreatment of ro in simultaneous treatment of calcium and turbidity which are influential components on scaling and colloidal fouling respectively in different waters to achieve this goal response surface methodology rsm was utilized to investigate the impact of the main parameters initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on the ec process as well as to optimize the three responses namely calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies along with operating cost moreover the effects of the two pretreatments hybrid ec filtration and filtration only on ro membrane fouling were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic water samples in this study synthetic water samples were prepared to simulate brackish water containing various calcium and turbidity concentrations to provide turbidity contaminated water approximately 5 g of kaolin powder passed through no 200 sieve was dissolved in 1 l of tap water the kaolin suspension was allowed to settle for 50 min to obtain a stable dispersion of the particles this stock kaolin was diluted to prepare water with initial turbidity within the range of 20 150 ntu the initial calcium concentration of the prepared turbid water was adjusted to the range of 100 400 mg l by adding the required amount of cacl2 the electrical conductivity of the solution was also increased using 0 017 m nacl 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure ec experiments were accomplished in a batch cell with a working volume of 1 l ec cell was equipped with 10 aluminum plate electrodes with an effective area of 451 cm2 connected to a dc power supply pw4053r model micro in galvanostatic mode the electrodes were fitted at a space of 1 cm in a monopolar parallel configuration the ec supernatant was used for calcium and turbidity concentration measurements after 30 min of settlement of the suspended matters the weight loss of the electrodes was measured for operating cost estimation in all the experiments the effect of the hybrid ec filtration pretreatment on ro membrane fouling was compared with that of the filtration only pretreatment by analyzing the flux decline trends for this purpose approximately 1 l of each sample synthetic raw water and the ec pretreated water at optimum operating conditions was filtered using a polypropylene cartridge filter of 5 μm for ro experiments the commercial flat sheet membrane tw30 1812 50 dow with an active area of 80 cm2 was loaded into a cross flow plate and frame module the tests were performed in batch mode at the constant operating pressure of 7 bar and the initial permeate flux of 22 l m2h before each run the ro membrane was rinsed with deionized water the data associated with the collected permeate water was recorded as a function of filtration time using a digital balance for flux calculation 2 3 analytical methods and cost estimation evaluation of ec performance was accomplished by the calculation of calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies calcium concentration was measured using the edta titration method 28 turbidity measurement was carried out by a turbidity meter hach model 2100 n the electrical conductivity value was determined using a conductivity meter wtw model 340 the percentage removal of calcium and turbidity was calculated according to eq 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y y 0 y y 0 100 where yo and y are the initial and final calcium concentration mg l turbidity ntu respectively based on the literature review the operating cost of ec is mainly affected by electrical energy and electrode consumption in the form of the following equation 29 31 2 ct acenergy bcelectrodes where ct is the operating cost of the ec process in us m3 cenergy and celectrodes are the energy consumed in kwh m3 and electrode consumed in kg al m3 respectively the coefficients of a and b are the unit prices equivalent to 0 024 us kwh and 2 78 us kg respectively in iran in 2017 the electrical energy consumption is expressed as eq 3 32 33 3 e 0 t v i d t where e electrical energy consumption kwh m3 v voltage v i current intensity a and t electrolysis time h 2 4 experimental design and model development central composite design ccd as the most used design method for the generation of second order response surface model 34 was utilized to determine the

to the model 37 38 in this research high r2 coefficient values were obtained 95 25 97 27 and 96 09 for calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating cost respectively in addition the predicted r2 and adjusted r2 values differing with less than 0 2 were in reasonable agreement the c v and adequate precision were calculated as 7 69 and 19 047 2 16 and 22 474 as well as

displayed in fig 1 a c all these obtained reports indicate the adequacy of the models as well as a desirable relationship between the experimental and predicted results 3 2 effects of the operating parameters on the ec process 3 2 1 initial calcium concentration turbidity initial calcium concentration had a significant influence on calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 a by increasing the initial calcium concentration at various times the calcium removal efficiency decreased for example a noticeable decrease of about 28 was obtained for calcium removal efficiency at the time of 35 min the average of the considered time range when the initial calcium concentration increased from 175 mg l to 325 mg l initial calcium concentration also had a negative effect on turbidity removal efficiency fig 3 a according to fig 3 a turbidity removal percentage declined from about 86 to 76 and 94 to 89 at the constant initial turbidity values of 52 5 ntu and 117 5 ntu respectively by changing the initial calcium concentration from 175 mg l to 325 mg l the decrease in removal rates of calcium and turbidity could be due to the insufficiency of complexion sites compared with aqueous calcium the effect of initial turbidity on calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies as well as operating cost is shown in figs 2 b 3 a and b as well as 4 a respectively fig 2 b reveals that an increase of initial turbidity resulted in a gradual decrease of calcium removal rate maximum decrease of about 8 was attained at the constant current density of 3 85 ma cm2 when the initial turbidity increased from 52 5 ntu to 117 5 ntu a higher turbidity removal efficiency was obtained with higher initial turbidity fig 3 a and b fig 3 a shows that at constant initial calcium concentrations of 175 mg l and 325 mg l by increasing the initial turbidity from 52 5 ntu to 117 5 ntu turbidity removal efficiency improved approximately 10 and 17 respectively this result is probably due to the higher amount of aluminum hydroxides as coagulants thus the additional coagulants may produce turbidity and consequently cause a slight drop in turbidity removal rate at lower initial turbidity merzouk et al 26 investigated the effect of initial turbidity concentration ranged from 100 800 mg l as silica gel on turbidity removal rate it was found that low initial turbidity concentrations 100 300 mg l as silica gel had no significant effect on removal efficiency while a significant reduction in removal rate occurred for higher concentrations a gradual increase in operating cost from about 1 9 us m3 to 2 1 us m3 at the time of 35 min also occurred by increasing initial turbidity fig 4 a 3 2 2 time current density the effect of time on calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating cost is seen in figs 2 a and c 3 c as well as 4 a and b according to fig 2 a and c increasing the time from 22 5 min to 47 5 min had a positive impact on calcium removal efficiency calcium removal efficiency steadily improved from approximately 39 52 and 28 36 when the values of initial calcium concentration were 175 mg l and 325 mg l respectively fig 2 a extending the treatment time could enhance the calcium removal efficiency due to greater generation of metal hydroxide flocs according to faradays law eq 9 the influence of time on turbidity removal efficiency follows an unsteady approach involving slight changes fig 3 c as shown in fig 3 c at lower current density 3 85 ma cm2 turbidity removal efficiency showed a minimal improvement of about 4 with the increase of time from 22 5 min to 47 5 min conversely it experienced a reducing trend of nearly 7 at higher current density 7 15 ma cm2 bukhari 27 also demonstrated that increasing time up to 20 min resulted in higher turbidity removal efficiency however the decrease of removal rate was obtained at a higher time the increasing rate of operating cost due to increasing time is illustrated in fig 4 a and b as time increased with the average constant current density of 5 5 ma cm2 operating cost raised dramatically from about 1 5 us m3 to 2 7 us m3 fig 4 b increasing time could induce an increase in operating cost associated with electrical energy and electrode consumption based on eqs 3 and 9 respectively 9 x i t m z f where x the coagulants generated by anodic dissolution g i current a t treatment time s m atomic mass mal 26 98 g mol z electron number zal 3 and f faradays constant 96 485 c mol 30 33 39 current density had a considerable effect on all the responses calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating cost greater removal of calcium occurred with higher current density shown in fig 2 b and c for instance according to fig 2 c the maximum calcium removal efficiency of 46 was obtained at the current density of 7 15 ma cm2 several research groups stated that the significant improvement in pollutant removal efficiency at higher current density was due to the increase in the production rate of coagulants faradays law and hydrogen bubble as well as the decrease in bubble size 18 26 30 31 current density had a reverse influence on the turbidity removal rate fig 3 b and c as seen in fig 3 b by increasing the current density from 3 85 ma cm2 to 7 15 ma cm2 slight reductions of about 3 and 9 were obtained for turbidity removal efficiency with the initial turbidity of 117 5 ntu and 52 5 ntu respectively these declining removal rates are likely related to the excess production of aluminum hydroxides which subsequently increases the turbidity of the aqueous solution similar results were reported by merzouk et al 26 which demonstrated that increasing current density from 11 55 ma cm2 to 91 5 ma cm2 led to a decrease in turbidity removal efficiency conversely a study evaluated the effectiveness of ec process in turbidity removal and showed the positive effect of increasing current density from 16 3 ma cm2 to 57 5 ma cm2 on turbidity removal rate 40 in another research an enhancement trend of turbidity removal efficiency was achieved by increasing current density up to 5 56 ma cm2 followed by a declining rate with further increase in current density 10 also aoudj et al 41 revealed that turbidity removal efficiency was not significantly influenced by current the influence of current density on operating cost is shown in fig 4 b as an example with the assumption of the constant time of 35 min an increase in current density from 3 85 ma cm2 to 7 15 ma cm2 caused an enormous rise of approximately 66 in operating cost from 1 5 us m3 to 2 5 us m3 in many studies the similar pattern of operating cost as a function of current density was exhibited regarding the removal of different pollutants such as nitrate 18 algae 31 and fluoride 33 3 3 performance of ec on ro fouling under optimum conditions the ultimate objective of this study is the evaluation of the ec performance on ro fouling at optimum conditions for this purpose the effects of 4 main parameters including initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on three responses calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating costs were optimized through ccd the optimum conditions were determined with the aim of achieving maximum calcium removal efficiency maximum turbidity removal efficiency and minimum operating cost in addition calcium concentration and turbidity were considered the constant values of 250 mg l and 85 ntu the average of the selected range respectively according to these conditions calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies as well as operating cost were achieved 36 93 5 and 1 58 us m3 respectively at the optimum conditions predicted by ccd time 35 5 min and current density 3 85 ma cm2 the experimental and predicted responses were in good agreement confirming the validity of the models to investigate whether ec pretreatment could efficiently reduce membrane fouling ro experiments were performed to compare the synthetic raw water containing the calcium concentration of 250 mg l and turbidity of 85 ntu with hybrid ec filtration and filtration only pretreatments under the optimum conditions as shown in table 4 the residual calcium and turbidity of the ec pretreated water were 160 mg l and 5 5 ntu corresponding to 36 and 93 5 removal efficiency respectively the residual turbidity of the ec pretreated water after filtration reduced to 0 2 ntu however the residual turbidity of the ro feed water with filtration only pretreatment was 5 ntu these results indicate that filtration and ec pretreatments are alone inefficient to achieve the desirable residual turbidity less than 1 ntu in order to evaluate the effects of the two pretreatments hybrid ec filtration and filtration only on ro fouling the normalized flux is presented as a function of filtration time fig 5 as seen in fig 5 both pretreatments experienced an initial rapid drop around 40 min and a milder reduction rate up to 180 min this initial decrease is related to the pore plugging of the membrane probably caused by the formation of calcium carbonate precipitation the normalized flux decline for the hybrid ec filtration pretreatment was lesser than that of the filtration only pretreatment after a duration of 180 min the normalized flux reached 0 71 and 0 57 for the hybrid ec filtration and filtration only pretreatments respectively equivalent to an improvement of 25 in ro recovery 4 conclusions in the present study ec was applied as a pretreatment of ro system for simultaneous calcium and turbidity removal to reduce membrane scaling and fouling the effective parameters including initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on ec performance and its operating cost were investigated using rsm based on the anova reports high values of r2 were achieved 95 25 97 27 and 96 09 for calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating cost respectively in addition the values of c v and adequate precision were obtained 10 and 4 respectively these results indicate that the experimental data was satisfactorily fitted to the empirical model the 3d surface plots demonstrated that calcium removal efficiency increased by the decrease of initial calcium concentration and initial turbidity as well as increase of time and current density the percentage removal of turbidity was enhanced as initial turbidity increased whereas initial calcium concentration and current density had a negative influence on the removal rate in addition time had a positive effect on turbidity removal efficiency at lower current density and a negative influence at higher current density the ec operating cost dramatically increased by the increase of initial turbidity time and current density the maximum calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies and minimum operating cost were 36 93 5 and 1 58 us m3 respectively at the optimum time of 35 5 min and the current density of 3 85 ma cm2 considering the constant initial calcium concentration of 250 mg l and the initial turbidity of 85 ntu the effects of the two pretreatments hybrid ec filtration and filtration only on ro fouling were examined by analyzing the normalized flux as a function of filtration time the ro recovery associated with the hybrid ec filtration was enhanced 25 compared with that of the filtration only pretreatment which indicated that ec could efficiently reduce scaling and fouling declaration of competing interest there

14043,in the present research electrocoagulation ec process was applied as a selected pretreatment to evaluate its effectiveness and operating cost regarding simultaneous calcium and turbidity removal in order to mitigate the scaling and colloidal fouling potential of reverse osmosis ro technology the effects of the main parameters namely initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on ec process were assessed and optimized by employing response surface methodology rsm a reasonable correlation between the experimental and predicted data was found through analysis of variance anova the highest calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies of 36 and 93 5 respectively and the minimal operating cost of 1 58 us m3 were obtained at the optimum time of 35 5 min and current density of 3 85 ma cm2 with the selected constant initial calcium concentration of 250 mg l and initial turbidity of 85 ntu in the present study the applicability of two pretreatments including hybrid ec filtration and filtration only to ro membrane fouling was also compared the ro recovery of the hybrid ec filtration pretreatment improved about 25 in comparison to that of the filtration only pretreatment which demonstrated the effective capability of the ec process in scaling and colloidal fouling mitigation keywords electrocoagulation reverse osmosis calcium and turbidity removal response surface methodology optimization 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro as a cost effective membrane process in comparison to other desalination technologies has faced with the restrictive problem of fouling 1 4 membrane fouling causes a decline in permeate flux and an increase in feed pressure consequently it results in higher operating and maintenance costs due to greater energy consumption and membrane cleaning replacement 2 5 7 fouling which results from the accumulation of inorganic or organic materials on the surface or in the pores of a membrane could be categorized into scaling as well as organic colloidal and biological fouling 4 8 9 the presence of calcium ions in feed water can increase the potential of membrane scaling due to the precipitation of low solubility salts especially caco3 and caso4 2h2o 10 colloidal and suspended matters might also form a cake layer on the membrane surface which increases the hydraulic resistance of the membrane 11 turbidity must be less than 1 ntu in ro feed water for prevention of colloidal fouling 3 8 to enhance the quality of ro feed water appropriate pretreatments should be considered the conventional approaches for reduction of scaling and colloidal fouling involve injecting antiscalants adding acid control of calcium carbonate precipitation softening with ion exchange chemical precipitation lime and soda ash and coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation and filtration 9 12 16 increased risk of ro membrane biofouling due to phosphate based antiscalants consumption 3 13 utilization of high amounts of acids salts generation of brine solutions and the requirement for disposal of a large volume of sludge are the demerits of the mentioned treatment technologies 12 16 17 electrocoagulation ec as a promising pretreatment has been proven to be effective in the removal of various types of pollutants to reduce ro membrane fouling 2 10 13 researchers have focused on ec process due to the absence of chemicals less sludge production versatility simplicity of operation compact size and low investment and operating costs 10 18 20 several studies have investigated the capability of ec to remove hardness 13 21 24 and turbidity 25 27 separately however on the basis of our literature review only zhao et al 10 explored ec performance in simultaneous hardness turbidity and cod removal from a specific produced water to enhance the ro feed water the performance of ec and its operating cost in the treatment of various solutions containing both hardness and turbidity have not been investigated so far furthermore in most of the conducted studies the impact of ec pretreatment on ro fouling was evaluated by comparing ec pretreated water and the raw water to the best of our knowledge the effects of the hybrid ec filtration and filtration only pretreatments on ro performance have not been compared therefore the principal aim of this work is to assess the efficiency and operating cost of the ec process as an alternative pretreatment of ro in simultaneous treatment of calcium and turbidity which are influential components on scaling and colloidal fouling respectively in different waters to achieve this goal response surface methodology rsm was utilized to investigate the impact of the main parameters initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on the ec process as well as to optimize the three responses namely calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies along with operating cost moreover the effects of the two pretreatments hybrid ec filtration and filtration only on ro membrane fouling were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic water samples in this study synthetic water samples were prepared to simulate brackish water containing various calcium and turbidity concentrations to provide turbidity contaminated water approximately 5 g of kaolin powder passed through no 200 sieve was dissolved in 1 l of tap water the kaolin suspension was allowed to settle for 50 min to obtain a stable dispersion of the particles this stock kaolin was diluted to prepare water with initial turbidity within the range of 20 150 ntu the initial calcium concentration of the prepared turbid water was adjusted to the range of 100 400 mg l by adding the required amount of cacl2 the electrical conductivity of the solution was also increased using 0 017 m nacl 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure ec experiments were accomplished in a batch cell with a working volume of 1 l ec cell was equipped with 10 aluminum plate electrodes with an effective area of 451 cm2 connected to a dc power supply pw4053r model micro in galvanostatic mode the electrodes were fitted at a space of 1 cm in a monopolar parallel configuration the ec supernatant was used for calcium and turbidity concentration measurements after 30 min of settlement of the suspended matters the weight loss of the electrodes was measured for operating cost estimation in all the experiments the effect of the hybrid ec filtration pretreatment on ro membrane fouling was compared with that of the filtration only pretreatment by analyzing the flux decline trends for this purpose approximately 1 l of each sample synthetic raw water and the ec pretreated water at optimum operating conditions was filtered using a polypropylene cartridge filter of 5 μm for ro experiments the commercial flat sheet membrane tw30 1812 50 dow with an active area of 80 cm2 was loaded into a cross flow plate and frame module the tests were performed in batch mode at the constant operating pressure of 7 bar and the initial permeate flux of 22 l m2h before each run the ro membrane was rinsed with deionized water the data associated with the collected permeate water was recorded as a function of filtration time using a digital balance for flux calculation 2 3 analytical methods and cost estimation evaluation of ec performance was accomplished by the calculation of calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies calcium concentration was measured using the edta titration method 28 turbidity measurement was carried out by a turbidity meter hach model 2100 n the electrical conductivity value was determined using a conductivity meter wtw model 340 the percentage removal of calcium and turbidity was calculated according to eq 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y y 0 y y 0 100 where yo and y are the initial and final calcium concentration mg l turbidity ntu respectively based on the literature review the operating cost of ec is mainly affected by electrical energy and electrode consumption in the form of the following equation 29 31 2 ct acenergy bcelectrodes where ct is the operating cost of the ec process in us m3 cenergy and celectrodes are the energy consumed in kwh m3 and electrode consumed in kg al m3 respectively the coefficients of a and b are the unit prices equivalent to 0 024 us kwh and 2 78 us kg respectively in

parameters on the ec process 3 2 1 initial calcium concentration turbidity initial calcium concentration had a significant influence on calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 a by increasing the initial calcium concentration at various times the calcium removal efficiency decreased for example a noticeable decrease of about 28 was obtained for calcium removal efficiency at the time of 35 min the average of the considered time range when the initial calcium concentration increased from 175 mg l to 325 mg l initial calcium concentration also had a negative effect on

respectively by changing the initial calcium concentration from 175 mg l to 325 mg l the decrease in removal rates of calcium and turbidity could be due to the insufficiency of complexion sites

approximately 66 in operating cost from 1 5 us m3 to 2 5 us m3 in many studies the similar pattern of operating cost as a function of current density was exhibited regarding the removal of different pollutants such as nitrate 18 algae 31 and fluoride 33 3 3 performance of ec on ro fouling under optimum conditions the ultimate objective of this study is the evaluation of the ec performance on ro fouling at optimum conditions for this purpose the effects of 4 main parameters including initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on three responses calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating costs were optimized through ccd the optimum conditions were determined with the aim of achieving maximum calcium removal efficiency maximum turbidity removal efficiency and minimum operating cost in addition calcium concentration and turbidity were considered the constant values of 250 mg l and 85 ntu the average of the selected range respectively according to these conditions calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies as well as operating cost were achieved 36 93 5 and 1 58 us m3 respectively at the optimum conditions predicted by ccd time 35 5 min and current density 3 85 ma cm2 the experimental and predicted responses were in good agreement confirming the validity of the models to investigate whether ec pretreatment could efficiently reduce membrane fouling ro experiments were performed to compare the synthetic raw water containing the calcium concentration of 250 mg l and turbidity of 85 ntu with hybrid ec filtration and filtration only pretreatments under the optimum conditions as shown in table 4 the residual calcium and turbidity of the ec pretreated water were 160 mg l and 5 5 ntu corresponding to 36 and 93 5 removal efficiency respectively the residual turbidity of the ec pretreated water after filtration reduced to 0 2 ntu however the residual turbidity of the ro feed water with filtration only pretreatment was 5 ntu these results indicate that filtration and ec pretreatments are alone inefficient to achieve the desirable residual turbidity less than 1 ntu in order to evaluate the effects of the two pretreatments hybrid ec filtration and filtration only on ro fouling the normalized flux is presented as a function of filtration time fig 5 as seen in fig 5 both pretreatments experienced an initial rapid drop around 40 min and a milder reduction rate up to 180 min this initial decrease is related to the pore plugging of the membrane probably caused by the formation of calcium carbonate precipitation the normalized flux decline for the hybrid ec filtration pretreatment was lesser than that of the filtration only pretreatment after a duration of 180 min the normalized flux reached 0 71 and 0 57 for the hybrid ec filtration and filtration only pretreatments respectively equivalent to an improvement of 25 in ro recovery 4 conclusions in the present study ec was applied as a pretreatment of ro system for simultaneous calcium and turbidity removal to reduce membrane scaling and fouling the effective parameters including initial calcium concentration initial turbidity time and current density on ec performance and its operating cost were investigated using rsm based on the anova reports high values of r2 were achieved 95 25 97 27 and 96 09 for calcium removal efficiency turbidity removal efficiency and operating cost respectively in addition the values of c v and adequate precision were obtained 10 and 4 respectively these results indicate that the experimental data was satisfactorily fitted to the empirical model the 3d surface plots demonstrated that calcium removal efficiency increased by the decrease of initial calcium concentration and initial turbidity as well as increase of time and current density the percentage removal of turbidity was enhanced as initial turbidity increased whereas initial calcium concentration and current density had a negative influence on the removal rate in addition time had a positive effect on turbidity removal efficiency at lower current density and a negative influence at higher current density the ec operating cost dramatically increased by the increase of initial turbidity time and current density the maximum calcium and turbidity removal efficiencies and minimum operating cost were 36 93 5 and 1 58 us m3 respectively at the optimum time of 35 5 min and the current density of 3 85 ma cm2 considering the constant initial calcium concentration of 250 mg l and the initial turbidity of 85 ntu the effects of the two pretreatments hybrid ec filtration and filtration only on ro fouling were examined by analyzing the normalized flux as a function of filtration time the ro recovery associated with the hybrid ec filtration was enhanced 25 compared with that of the filtration only pretreatment which indicated that ec could efficiently reduce scaling and fouling declaration of competing interest there

excreted to soils sewage and waters in an unaltered or metabolized form after their administration the behavior of phc in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp depends on many properties including

tests were carried out using lettuce lactuca sativa seeds as the test organism the seeds were immersed in 0 1 sodium hypochlorite naocl solution during 20 min to sterilize them afterwards they were washed with 200 ml of mineral water under stirring for 10 min this procedure was repeated 3 times the tests were all performed in quadruplicate besides the initial and treated solutions four dilutions of each solution were prepared 70 50 30 and 10 in volume and mineral water was used as the control for each solution 2 ml were poured on a filter paper disc that covered the bottom of a 10 cm petri

hypocotyl is the stem of a germinating seedling found below the cotyledons and above the radicle outliers were removed using the chauvenet principle and the germination index gi was calculated eq 4

apparatus the experiments were performed in a batch mode light emitting diode led photoreactor from delpho instruments model multi fotons 320ra fig 1 equipped with magnetic stirring the reactor chamber is comprised of a polished aluminum cylinder containing 320 leds they are arranged in 8 groups of 40 leds 4 rows with 10 leds each the first 7 groups contain monochromatic leds 365 400 470 515 568 624 and 650 nm and the final one contain white leds visible continuous emission spectrum their nominal maximum electrical power is 68 mw each information given by the manufacturer all the necessary operational parameters are conveniently adjusted in the reactor front panel 2 4 1 experimental procedure all experiments were performed in batch mode using a 200 ml borosilicate beaker without graduation centered in the reactor chamber the beaker was continuously stirred to ensure its content homogenization a single solution containing the five drugs 10 mg l 1 each was used throughout the experiments the initial ph was set to 6 5 0 1 with sodium hydroxide nitric acid the response surface methodology rsm was used to estimate the best reactional conditions 34 iron iii oxalic acid and hydrogen peroxide were added according to the experimental design the photochemistry of ferric and ferrous complexes in the presence of oxalic acid has been extensively studied 19 22 23 35 the traditional photo fenton process relies on the fe oh 2 photochemistry that complex is stable in the 2 5 3 5 ph range and absorbs near ultraviolet light 36 ferrioxalate complexes avoid the precipitation of ferric iron at near neutral ph and increase the absorption of photons up to 580 nm 22 the relative amount of iron iii to oxalate is a critical parameter the yield of iron ii formation decreases as the iron oxalate molar ratio increases as the amount of oxalate is not enough for complexing all iron present on the other hand low iron oxalate molar ratios increase the competition between oxalate and the target pollutant for the hydroxyl radicals therefore the stoichiometric molar ratio of the ferrioxalate complex which is 1 3 iron oxalate was used 37 the reaction was performed at room temperature with 365 nm leds variable power after a pre defined period of time the reactor was turned off and the ph of the beaker content was adjusted to 10 0 0 1 to interrupt degradation finally cellulose acetate membranes pore diameter 0 45 μm were used to vacuum filter the samples which were then analyzed 2 4 2 response surface methodology rsm the best operational conditions were estimated in a multivariate manner using the rsm approach this methodology encompasses three steps in the first one a preliminary 2 k factorial design k factors 2 levels with three replicates in the central point was performed to determine a the experimental error standard error b the statistical significance of the tested factors and c the direction of the optimal region second a series of experiments were performed along with the path of steepest ascent or descent until a maximum or minimum point is reached finally that extreme point is used as the central one of another experimental design with at least three levels once the polynomial that explains the observed responses is obtained the optimal condition can be estimated 38 initially three independent factors were studied led power as a percentage of the nominal one hydrogen peroxide and iron iii concentrations table s1 presents the levels of each factor and their codification as several responses needed to be simultaneously optimized the degradation of the five drugs a joint response variable was set in the form of a desirability function 39 a desirability function was derived based on derringer and suich 39 the aim of the concept is to find the best operational conditions when multiple responses must be considered as the degradation of the five drugs is to be maximized eq 5 was used in which d i y ˆ i is the desirability function for each response variable y ˆ i l i is the lowest acceptable value for the response 24 u i is the highest value for the response 100 and s is the weight 1 finally the geometric mean of the individual desirabilities was calculated the global desirability d 5 d i y ˆ i x 0 i f y ˆ i x l i y ˆ i x l i u i l i s i f l i y ˆ i x u i 1 i f y ˆ i x u i second four experiments were performed along with the path of steepest ascent as the degradation always increased along the path and reached the brazilian legal effluent discharge limit for total iron fe2 fe3 the c f e 3 factor latter was fixed at 15 mg l 1 40 next a central composite design ccd was performed with the other two factors the central point in triplicate of the ccd was the last one in the path of steepest ascent c f e 3 15 mg l 1 table s2 presents the new levels and their codification all statistical analyses were performed with the aid of the statistica software version 10 the degradation kinetic constants of all drugs were estimated at the optimized degradation conditions adjusting a pseudo first order kinetic model to the experimental data using the least squares method the whole optimization procedure is summarized by the flowchart shown in fig 2 2 4 3 optimal condition experiments during the photo fenton process hydroxyl radicals h o are generated and act as the main oxidizing agent on the degradation of the drugs eq 6 represents the oxidation kinetics of each studied drug by the photo fenton process where c f represents the drug concentration k is the degradation rate constant and c h o the concentration of hydroxyl radicals 6 d c f d t k c f c h o eq 6 indicates a second order degradation rate however since the drug concentration c f during the reaction is significantly higher than that of the hydroxyl radicals c h o eq 6 can be simplified to a pseudo first order rate equation eq 7 in which k k c h o 41 43 7 d c f d t k c f 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization from the results of the preliminary 23 factorial design table s3 three pieces of information were obtained a the estimated experimental error was 0 76 a sufficient low value to proceed with the optimization routine b the studied variables within tested levels and their first order interactions were all statistically significantly 95 confidence interval as depicted by the pareto s chart fig 3 on that chart bars that cross the reference red line are statistically significant c the steepest ascent direction was the one that increased all three factors the reaction time in this preliminary design was 15 min one can observe in the pareto s chart that within tested levels only the three factors and the interaction between c f e 3 and led power were indeed significant the interactions involving c h 2 o 2 were barely significant moreover among the factors c h 2 o 2 had the least importance which increased in the order c h 2 o 2 led power c f e 3 that is a somewhat unexpected behavior as hydrogen peroxide is a fundamental reagent of the fenton s reaction eq 2 probably the range of tested c h 2 o 2 was already in the vicinity of the optimal value where the response variable remains almost the same in this way the c h 2 o 2 importance would be underestimated the c f e 3 is by far the most important factor this finding confirms the paramount role of the fe2 fe3 couple in the process eqs 1 2 next as the photo fenton reaction eq 2 needs photons led power is the second most important factor as the three factors all had positive effects one can say that increasing them from level 1 to level 1 also increases the response desirability function as degradation for run 4 table s3 was approximately 90 in 15 min for the continuity of the optimization process the reaction time was reduced to 5 min four experiments were performed along the path of steepest ascent table s4 presents the respective results as shown in table s4 the greatest degradation was achieved with c f e 3 15 0 mg l 1 as this is the total iron concentration legally allowed to be discharged in brazil 40 this concentration was fixed and a ccd was performed using the conditions of run 4 as the central point table s5 presents the obtained results a polynomial function eq 8 was adjusted least squares to the results presented in table s5 x 1 and x 2 are the codified factors led power and c h 2 o 2 mg l 1 respectively and y ˆ is the desirability the anova analysis of variance table s6 showed that the regression was statistically significant 95 confidence limit with mqr mqr f6 4 and r2 0 959 for a maximum explicable variation r2 of 0 999 44 8 y ˆ x 0 444 0 057 x 1 0 025 x 2 0 054 x 1 2 0 052 x 2 2 0 048 x 1 2 x 2 0 083 x 1 x 2 2 finally by calculating the maximum of eq 8 the optimal codified degradation conditions were obtained ①led power 0 49 65 i e 0 65 40 leds 68 mw 1 768 w ② c h 2 o 2 0 07 47 6 mg l 1 ③ c f e 3 15 0 mg l 1 fixed the contour plot of the surface described by eq 8 and the optimal point can be observed in fig 4 by the end of the optimization procedure one can observe that the optimal hydrogen peroxide concentration was indeed within the initial tested range 15 60 mg l 1 strengthening the allegedly hypothesis regarding the underestimation of the c h 2 o 2 effect moreover the careful choice of initial conditions for performing the preliminary 23 factorial design together with the rsm approach nicely guided the experiments towards the degradation system optimization 3 2 optimal condition experiments the estimated rate constants and the respective determination coefficients r2 for each drug are given in fig 5 one can observe that the joint degradation of the five drugs was quite similar pseudo first order kinetics fast degradation approximately 80 during the first 10 min and virtually identical rate constants those results confirm the low selectivity of hydroxyl radicals trovó et al 45 investigated the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals including paracetamol 15 mg l 1 in aqueous solutions via black light photoreactor 15 w using potassium ferrioxalate as an iron source the results showed complete oxidation after 10 min on the other hand the mineralization degree was significantly lower than the drugs degradation during the same period of time 25 min cod and doc removals were 40 and 30 respectively fig 6 that indicates that relatively large concentrations of degradation products were formed which are likely more resistant to the attack of hydroxyl radicals souza et al 23 observed similar doc removal approximately 55 when they degraded aqueous solutions containing 20 mg l 1 diclofenac by solar photo fenton process 37 9 w with ferrioxalate 1 3 iron oxalate molar ratio at ph 5 0 during 90 min according to vogel et al 29 during degradation processes it may occur adsorption effects on reactor walls catalysts biomass volatilization of organic compounds sedimentation complexation precipitation or water evaporation in the reaction medium those factors can directly affect the concentrations of the substances present in a sample therefore it cannot be concluded that degradation indeed occurred only by the results of doc and or cod analysis it is possible to obtain important information on degradation processes by combining toc or doc and cod measurements into a third parameter the moc the moc can help in predicting the end of the reaction and is an alternative way to monitor the conversion of environmentally harmful carbon species into safer ones 29 by calculating the moc it was possible to follow the oxidation of the compounds in the reaction medium fig 5 the initial moc was 2 7 and after 25 min of treatment it increased to 1 9 eq 3 that indicates that the organic compounds were indeed oxidized and is in accordance with the low mineralization degree observed since the final moc was much below 4 the oxidation number referring to the complete oxidation of the organic carbon present organic carbon to co2 one can also observe fig 5 that mineralization linearly increased k 6 3 10 1 mg c l 1min 1 r2 0 992 if such behavior continues after 25 min it can be estimated that the complete mineralization of the compounds would occur after approximately 80 min of reaction pérez estrada et al 46 used the solar photo fenton process 92 4 w without ferrioxalate to degrade aqueous dcf they reported that under the applied conditions hydrogen peroxide concentration maintained between 200 and 400 mg l 1 fe2 0 0 05 mmol l 1 dcf 0 50 mg l 1 near neutral ph range the complete removal of dcf was achieved after 60 min and mineralization after 100 min trovó et al 43 performed degradation studies on caffeine containing aqueous solutions h2o2 0 42 0 mg l 1 fe2 0 10 0 mg l 1 caf 0 52 0 mg l 1 6 ph 8 using the photo fenton process high pressure mercury vapor lamp 400 w they reported rapid initial degradation 98 5 during the first 20 min and complete mineralization after 120 min of reaction the rate constant was 0 014 min 1 3 3 phytotoxicity test as mineralization is directly related to the chosen oxidation process applied conditions and treatment time quite often it is not achieved therefore the formation of oxidation by products more dangerous than the original pollutant is a matter of concern 47 schmitt jansen et al 48 exposed a diclofenac solution 50 mg l 1 to sunlight the results showed that phytotoxicity scenedesmus vacuolatus increased after 53 h of exposure isidori et al 49 and dellagreca et al 50 reported that some anti inflammatory drugs and their degradation photoproducts were toxic in acute and chronic bioassays with algae and microcrustaceans however in this study both the initial pharmaceuticals solution and the treated one after 20 min showed no phytotoxicity lactuca sativa 4 conclusion once optimized experimental design response surface methodology the degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetics for all studied pharmaceutical compounds fast degradation was achieved after 25 min the concentrations of all of the studied drugs were below the detection limit of the method however low mineralization was observed 30 the results showed the feasibility of degrading diclofenac paracetamol salicylic acid ketoprofen and caffeine using the ferrioxalate mediated photo fenton process at near neutral conditions also small amounts of luminous power are enough to drive the process moreover the proposed degradation method did not generate ecotoxicity towards lactuca sativa therefore the use of leds is a proper choice for saving resources as the photo fenton process depends on several variables carefully designed and optimized experiments are of fundamental importance for maximizing degradation

tests were carried out using lettuce lactuca sativa seeds as the test organism the seeds were immersed in 0 1 sodium hypochlorite naocl solution during 20 min to sterilize them afterwards they were washed with 200 ml of mineral water under stirring for 10 min this procedure was repeated 3 times the tests were all performed in quadruplicate besides the initial and treated solutions four dilutions of each solution were prepared 70 50 30 and 10 in volume and mineral water was used as the control for each solution 2 ml were poured on a filter paper disc that covered the bottom of a 10 cm petri dish ten seeds were placed on each dish the dishes were then closed and incubated in the dark for 120 h at 24 1 c the germinated seeds were counted g and their hypocotyl length l measured the hypocotyl is the stem of a germinating seedling found below the cotyledons and above the radicle outliers were removed using the chauvenet principle and the germination index gi was calculated eq 4 where gs is the number of germinated seeds of a sample and ls is the hypocotyl length of this sample gc and lc are the corresponding parameters in the control 30 32 4 g i g s l s g c l c 100 the gi was finally used to estimate the half maximal effective concentration ec 50 referring to the dilution in which the gi is reduced in 50 the adjusted spearman karber method was used 33 2 4 experimental apparatus the experiments were performed in a batch mode light emitting diode led photoreactor from delpho instruments model multi fotons 320ra fig 1 equipped with magnetic stirring the reactor chamber is comprised of a polished aluminum cylinder containing 320 leds they are arranged in 8 groups of 40 leds 4 rows with 10 leds each the first 7 groups contain monochromatic leds 365 400 470 515 568 624 and 650 nm and the final one contain white leds visible continuous emission spectrum their nominal maximum electrical power is 68 mw each information given by the manufacturer all the necessary operational parameters are conveniently adjusted in the reactor front panel 2 4 1 experimental procedure all experiments were performed in batch mode using a 200 ml borosilicate beaker without graduation centered in the reactor chamber the beaker was continuously stirred to ensure its content homogenization a single solution containing the five drugs 10 mg l 1 each was used throughout the experiments the initial ph was set to 6 5 0 1 with sodium hydroxide nitric acid the response surface methodology rsm was used to estimate the best reactional conditions 34 iron iii oxalic acid and hydrogen peroxide were added according to the experimental design the photochemistry of ferric and ferrous complexes in the presence of oxalic acid has been extensively studied 19 22 23 35 the traditional photo fenton process relies on the fe oh 2 photochemistry that complex is stable in the 2 5 3 5 ph range and absorbs near ultraviolet light 36 ferrioxalate complexes avoid the precipitation of ferric iron at near neutral ph and increase the absorption of photons up to 580 nm 22 the relative amount of iron iii to oxalate is a critical parameter the yield of iron ii formation decreases as the iron oxalate molar ratio increases as the amount of oxalate is not enough for complexing all iron present on the other hand low iron oxalate molar ratios increase the competition between oxalate and the target pollutant for the hydroxyl radicals therefore the stoichiometric molar ratio of the ferrioxalate complex which is 1 3 iron oxalate was used 37 the reaction was performed at room temperature with 365 nm leds variable power after a pre defined period of time the reactor was turned off and the ph of the beaker content was adjusted to 10 0 0 1 to interrupt degradation finally cellulose acetate membranes pore diameter 0 45 μm were used to vacuum filter the samples which were then analyzed 2 4 2 response surface methodology rsm the best operational conditions were estimated in a multivariate manner using the rsm approach this methodology encompasses three steps in the first one a preliminary 2 k factorial design k factors 2 levels with three replicates in the central point was performed to determine a the experimental error standard error b the statistical significance of the tested factors and c the direction of the optimal region second a series of experiments were performed along with the path of steepest ascent or descent until a maximum or minimum point is reached finally that extreme point is used as the central one of another experimental design with at least three levels once the polynomial that explains the observed responses is obtained the optimal condition can be estimated 38 initially three independent factors were studied led power as a percentage of the nominal one hydrogen peroxide and iron iii concentrations table s1 presents the levels of each factor and their codification as several responses needed to be simultaneously optimized the degradation of the five drugs a joint response variable was set in the form of a desirability function 39 a desirability function was derived based on derringer and suich 39 the aim of the concept is to find the best operational conditions when multiple responses must be considered as the degradation of the five drugs is to be maximized eq 5 was used in which d i y ˆ i is the desirability function for each response variable y ˆ i l i is the lowest acceptable value for the response 24 u i is the highest value for the response 100 and s is the weight 1 finally the geometric mean of the individual desirabilities was calculated the global desirability d 5 d i y ˆ i x 0 i f y ˆ i x l i y ˆ i x l i u i l i s i f l i y ˆ i x u i 1 i f y ˆ i x u i second four experiments were performed along with the path of steepest ascent as the degradation always increased along the path and reached the brazilian legal effluent discharge limit for total iron fe2 fe3 the c f e 3 factor latter was fixed at 15 mg l 1 40 next a central composite design ccd was performed with the other two factors the central point in triplicate of the ccd was the last one in the path of steepest ascent c f e 3 15 mg l 1 table s2 presents the new levels and their codification all statistical analyses were performed with the aid of the statistica software version 10 the degradation kinetic constants of all drugs were estimated at the optimized degradation conditions adjusting a pseudo first order kinetic model to the experimental data using the least squares method the whole optimization procedure is summarized by the flowchart shown in fig 2 2 4 3 optimal condition experiments during the photo fenton process hydroxyl radicals h o are generated and act as the main oxidizing agent on the degradation of the drugs eq 6 represents the oxidation kinetics of each studied drug by the photo fenton process where c f represents the drug concentration k is the degradation rate constant and c h o the concentration of hydroxyl radicals 6 d c f d t k c f c h o eq 6 indicates a second order degradation rate however since the drug concentration c f during the reaction is significantly higher than that of the hydroxyl radicals c h o eq 6 can be simplified to a pseudo first order rate equation eq 7 in which k k c h o 41 43 7 d c f d t k c f 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization from the results of the preliminary 23 factorial design table s3 three pieces of information were obtained a the estimated experimental error was 0 76 a sufficient low value to proceed with the optimization routine b the studied variables within tested levels and their first order interactions were all statistically significantly 95 confidence interval as depicted by the pareto s chart fig 3 on that chart bars that cross the reference red line are statistically significant c the steepest ascent direction was the one that increased all three factors the reaction time in this preliminary design was 15 min one can observe in the pareto s chart that within tested levels only the three factors and the interaction between c f e 3 and led power were indeed significant the interactions involving c h 2 o 2 were barely significant moreover among the factors c h 2 o 2 had the least importance which increased in the order c h 2 o 2 led power c f e 3 that is a somewhat unexpected behavior as hydrogen peroxide is a fundamental reagent of the fenton s reaction eq 2 probably the range of tested c h 2 o 2 was already in the vicinity of the optimal value where the response variable remains almost the same in this way the c h 2 o 2 importance would be underestimated the c f e 3 is by far the most important factor this finding confirms the paramount role of the fe2 fe3 couple in the process eqs 1 2 next as the photo fenton reaction eq 2 needs photons led power is the second most important factor as the three factors all had positive effects one can say that increasing them from level 1 to level 1 also increases the response desirability function as degradation for run 4 table s3 was approximately 90 in 15 min for the continuity of the optimization process the reaction time was reduced to 5 min four experiments were performed along the path of steepest ascent table s4 presents the respective results as shown in table s4 the greatest degradation was achieved with c f e 3 15 0 mg l 1 as this is the total iron concentration legally allowed to be discharged in brazil 40 this concentration was fixed and a ccd was performed using the conditions of run 4 as the central point table s5 presents the obtained results a polynomial function eq 8 was adjusted least squares to the results presented in table s5 x 1 and x 2 are the codified factors led power and c h 2 o 2 mg l 1 respectively and y ˆ is the desirability the anova analysis of variance table s6 showed that the regression was statistically significant 95 confidence limit with mqr mqr f6 4 and r2 0 959 for a maximum explicable variation r2 of 0 999 44 8 y ˆ x 0 444 0 057 x 1 0 025 x 2 0 054 x 1 2 0 052 x 2 2 0 048 x 1 2 x 2 0 083 x 1 x 2 2 finally by calculating the maximum of eq 8 the optimal codified degradation conditions were obtained ①led power 0 49 65 i e 0 65 40 leds 68 mw 1 768 w ② c h 2 o 2 0 07 47 6 mg l 1 ③ c f e 3 15 0 mg l 1 fixed the contour plot of the surface described by eq 8 and the optimal point can be observed in fig 4 by the end of the optimization procedure one can observe that the optimal hydrogen peroxide concentration was indeed within the initial tested range 15 60 mg l 1 strengthening the allegedly hypothesis regarding the underestimation of the c h 2 o 2 effect moreover the careful choice of initial conditions for performing the preliminary 23 factorial design together with the rsm approach nicely guided the experiments towards the degradation system optimization 3 2 optimal condition experiments the estimated rate constants and the respective determination coefficients r2 for each drug are given in fig 5 one can observe that the joint degradation of the five drugs was quite similar pseudo first order kinetics fast degradation approximately 80 during the first 10 min and virtually identical rate constants those results confirm the low selectivity of hydroxyl radicals trovó et al 45 investigated the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals including paracetamol 15 mg l 1 in aqueous solutions via black light photoreactor 15 w using potassium ferrioxalate as an iron source the results showed complete oxidation after 10 min on the other hand the mineralization degree was significantly lower than the drugs degradation during the same period of time 25 min cod and doc removals were 40 and 30 respectively fig 6 that indicates that relatively large concentrations of degradation products were formed which are likely more resistant to the attack of hydroxyl radicals souza et al 23 observed similar doc removal approximately 55 when they degraded aqueous solutions containing 20 mg l 1 diclofenac by solar photo fenton process 37 9 w with ferrioxalate 1 3 iron oxalate molar ratio at ph 5 0 during 90 min according to vogel et al 29 during degradation processes it may occur adsorption effects on reactor walls catalysts biomass volatilization of organic compounds sedimentation complexation precipitation or water evaporation in the reaction medium those factors can directly affect the concentrations of the substances present in a sample therefore it cannot be concluded that degradation indeed occurred only by the results of doc and or cod analysis it is possible to obtain important information on degradation processes by combining toc or doc and cod measurements into a third parameter the moc the moc can help in predicting the end of the reaction and is an alternative way to monitor the conversion of environmentally harmful carbon species into safer ones 29 by calculating the moc it was possible to follow the oxidation of the compounds in the reaction medium fig 5 the initial moc was 2 7 and after 25 min of treatment it increased to 1 9 eq 3 that indicates that the organic compounds were indeed oxidized and is in accordance with the low mineralization degree observed since the final moc was much below 4 the oxidation number referring to the complete oxidation of the organic carbon present organic carbon to co2 one can also observe fig 5 that mineralization linearly increased k 6 3 10 1 mg c l 1min 1 r2 0 992 if such behavior continues after 25 min it can be estimated that the complete mineralization of the compounds would occur after approximately 80 min of reaction pérez estrada et al 46 used the solar photo fenton process 92 4 w without ferrioxalate to degrade aqueous dcf they reported that under the applied conditions hydrogen peroxide concentration maintained between 200 and 400 mg l 1 fe2 0 0 05 mmol l 1 dcf 0 50 mg l 1 near neutral ph range the complete removal of dcf was achieved after 60 min and mineralization after 100 min trovó et al 43 performed degradation studies on caffeine containing aqueous solutions h2o2 0 42 0 mg l 1 fe2 0 10 0 mg l 1 caf 0 52 0 mg l 1 6 ph 8 using the photo fenton process high pressure mercury vapor lamp 400 w they reported rapid initial degradation 98 5 during the first 20 min and complete mineralization after 120 min of reaction the rate constant was 0 014 min 1 3 3 phytotoxicity test as mineralization is directly related to the chosen oxidation process applied conditions and treatment time quite often it is not achieved therefore the formation of oxidation by products more dangerous than the original pollutant is a matter of concern 47 schmitt jansen et al 48 exposed a diclofenac solution 50 mg l 1 to sunlight the results showed that phytotoxicity scenedesmus vacuolatus increased after 53 h of exposure isidori et al 49 and dellagreca et al 50 reported that some anti inflammatory drugs and their degradation photoproducts were toxic in acute and chronic bioassays with algae and microcrustaceans however in this study both the initial pharmaceuticals solution and the treated one after 20 min showed no phytotoxicity lactuca sativa 4 conclusion once optimized experimental design response surface methodology the degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetics for all studied pharmaceutical compounds fast degradation was achieved after 25 min the concentrations of all of the studied drugs were below the detection limit of the method however low mineralization was observed 30 the results showed the feasibility of degrading diclofenac paracetamol salicylic acid ketoprofen and caffeine using the ferrioxalate mediated photo fenton process at near neutral conditions also small amounts of luminous power are enough to drive the process moreover the proposed degradation method did not generate ecotoxicity towards lactuca sativa therefore the use of leds is a proper choice for saving resources as the photo fenton process depends on several variables carefully designed and optimized experiments are of fundamental importance for maximizing degradation
