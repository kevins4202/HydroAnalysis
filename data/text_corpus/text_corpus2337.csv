supply data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction elevated arsenic as concentration in groundwater of natural origin is recognized as a severe environmental problem in many parts of the world and exposure to as contamination through drinking water has been identified as a serious public health concern owing to its potential risk to human health kapaj et al 2006 nordstrom 2002 nriagu et al 2007 arsenic contamination of drinking water supplies reported from more than 70 countries is a serious health hazard to an estimated 150 million people world wide bhattacharya et al 2004 ravenscroft et al 2011 bangladesh is one of the most severely affected countries where manually operated suction mode hand tubewells are the major means of drinking water supplies according to the latest national census bbs 2011 conducted by the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs 89 1 of the total households of the country use tubewells as the source for their drinking water supply more than 90 of these tubewells are installed by tubewell drillers as initiatives of the local community at an affordable cost a nationwide hydro chemical survey conducted by british geological survey and department of public health engineering sampled 3534 tubewells from 61 of 64 districts of the country bgs 2001 compared to the who guideline value 10 μg l and bangladesh drinking water standard bdws of 50 μg l as concentration exceeded in 51 and 28 of the surveyed tubewells their results also indicate that 10 50 m is the mostly exploited depth range and about 85 of the total wells were within the depth range of 80 m this is easily exploitable by the local tubewell drillers using the hand percussion sludger method a cost effective local technology which uses readily available inexpensive equipment after all these years since as discovery in bangladesh in 1993 the mitigation scenario is still far from the real need of safe water supplies exposure to as contamination through drinking water estimated by the bgs dphe study with respect to who guideline and bdws was 57 million and 35 million this estimation was done based on a population of 125 5 million in 1999 later a second survey conducted in 2009 by bbs unicef bbs 2011 indicated the exposures as 53 and 22 million with respect to who guideline and bdws despite numerous efforts towards as mitigation about 20 million people are still exposed to as contamination through drinking water bbs unicef 2015 jamil et al 2019 considering 50 ppb of bangladesh standard this number would be double if who guideline of 10 ppb is taken into consideration from this study area matlab a social survey and mapping done in 96 villages hossain et al 2014 found that only 18 of the operating tubewells provide as safe water a wide variability of the access to as safe water between 0 and 90 percent was also observed during this survey which reflects the variation in socio economic condition unplanned installations and largely the lack of knowledge in hydrogeological suitability for chemical hazards important factors to be considered are a toxicity that is severity of health effects b concentration to which the population is exposed and c the period of exposure arsenic toxicity from a prolonged exposure is a serious health concern and continuous consumption can lead to arsenicosis skin alterations cardiovascular diseases and eventually to a variety of cancers smith and steinmaus 2009 and also could be associated with increased mortality argos et al 2010 besides as excess intake of manganese mn could also be a health concern although it is an essential element required for the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins and in general mn intake mainly occurs via food earlier in the 1993 and 2004 versions of who guideline who 2004 1993 the value for mn was set at 0 5 mg l and 0 4 mg l respectively findings from different studies focusing on health effects for children from excessive mn in drinking water have drawn attention adverse effects of elevated mn on fetal growth birth outcome children s intellectual development bouchard et al 2011 khan et al 2011 and even increased child mortality barrett 2007 brown and foos 2009 grazuleviciene et al 2009 kile et al 2009 ljung et al 2009 menezes filho et al 2009 wasserman et al 2006 2008 wood 2009 highlighted the importance of achieving low mn in drinking water roels et al 2012 also reported an inverse relation between mn in groundwater used for drinking and cognitive performance of the children it is noteworthy that mn intake from food is larger than that from water while but strictly adjusted to the need the uptake from water is not controlled frisbie et al 2015 based on many studies conducted on health effects of mn and population drinking water with elevated mn in over 50 different countries frisbie et al 2015 emphasized the urgency of the need for re evaluation of who guideline for some toxic inorganic substances including mn especially as bangladesh has more than 60 million people drinking water in excess of 0 4 mg l mn rahman et al 2013 2015 different alternative safe drinking water options distributed among the people of as affected areas have been evaluated by hossain et al 2015 the risk of as contamination mostly lies with shallow tubewells bhattacharya et al 2002b hossain et al 2014 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 van geen et al 2002 von brömssen et al 2007 deep hand tubewells installed as an as mitigation option mostly by government and ngos are usually drilled up to a depth of about 250 m the numbers of deep wells are still very low compared to as exposure and the actual need to ensure as safe water access the most important reason is the installation cost which is beyond the affordability of local communities especially for the poor and disadvantaged section of society in the context of safe drinking water supplies when managing arsenic is still far from a reality elevated mn in groundwater has made the situation even more critical in addition to as bgs dphe studies bgs 2001 included mn as an element of health concern their survey results available from tubewells ranging from 7 to 362 m depth provide a very low 0 001 mg l mn content to as high as 9 98 mg l compared with who guideline who 2004 58 of their results are within and remaining 42 exceed the guideline value of 0 4 mg l distinctly different regional patterns for as and mn fig 1 a and b have also been indicated by bgs dphe survey hasan et al 2007 investigated three different physiographic settings of bangladesh namely ganges flood plain gfp meghna flood plain mfp and ganges delta plain gdp on the basis of hydrochemical characterization of groundwater samples collected from the shallow tubewells within the depth range of 80 m in their studies none of these three units was found suitable when both as and mn are considered together for the installation of shallow drinking water tubewells red and off white sands could be a good source for tapping as safe water biswas et al 2012 hossain et al 2014 von brömssen et al 2007 but elevated mn in those aquifers is a concern in the context of the drinking water safety plan who 2004 moreover these oxidized sediments are not available in all as affected places throughout the country johnston et al 2014 discussed enhancing arsenic mitigation in bangladesh based on the findings from institutional psychological and technical investigations with the reference of groundwater models and field studies they indicated that in the great majority of the as affected areas although the risk of as contamination in deep groundwater is small mn fe and salinity could pose water quality problems in central and northern bangladesh exceedance of mn by health based value of 0 4 mg l is frequent bbs 2011 who 2011 high concentration of mn between 2 and 5 mg l from as safe deep tubewells installed at depths from 190 to 240 m in sreenagar of munshiganj district in south central bangladesh has been reported by hug et al 2011 elevated mn along with as has also been reported from murshidabad west bengal india sankar et al 2014 in the context of mitigation management plan red stained platform was found to be useful for identifying high as tubewells whereas expected black discoloration for mn was found to be masked by red discoloration caused from fe oxides annaduzzaman et al 2018 depth specific piezometer nests were installed at 15 locations in the matlab area spread over 410 km2 fig 2 for monitoring the behavior of groundwater system mainly hydraulic heads and water chemistry hossain 2015 hossain et al 2014 in terms of relative depth these monitoring wells were grouped into shallow intermediate and deep piezometers in most of the nests four shallow wells were installed within the depth range of 70 m one was completed deeper in the intermediate depth at about 115 m and deep well was put at a depth of about 235 m based on observations of low as and mn from those piezometers installed at intermediate depths designated as intermediate deep aquifers ida hossain 2015 245 drinking water tubewells herein termed as intermediate deep tubewells idtw were installed to expand the exploration around the piezometer nests at a targeted depth of 120 m for exploiting as safe and low mn water to provide water supply in the study area this study pioneers the exploration and exploitation of the intermediate resources between shallow and deep systems for the first time in the country the aim of this study is to create and share results on the suitability of ida in the context of as mn and other relevant water quality parameters so that the potentiality of this unexploited aquifer can be used as a new horizon for the installation of hand tubewells for safe drinking water along with as and mn pattern this study makes hydrochemical characterization of the intermediate deep system focusing the redox sensitive parameters major ions and trace elements taking detailed water chemistry into account as well as the depth to groundwater required for abstraction of groundwater through conventional hand tubewells this article focuses on how this strategy could be helpful for scaling up safe water access 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the matlab region divided into north and south supplementary fig s1 is situated within the chandpur district in southeastern bangladesh between 23015 0 and 23030 0 n latitude and 90034 0 and 90049 0 e longitude covers an area of 410 km2 with a total population of more than half a million agriculture is the main land use pattern and the principal means of livelihood some basic demographic information are provided in supplementary table s1 considering the rainfall records for the period from 1981 to 2012 the total annual rainfall at the nearest chandpur station is 2175 mm bbs 2013 geomophologically the study area is classified as deltaic plains constituted by meghna flood plain in the west and chandina deltaic plain in the east bakr 1977 morgan and mcintire 1959 the river meghna and its tributaries formed deposits composed of clay silt and sand with similar lithologic characteristics found in the more oxidized and compacted chandina formation 2 2 intervention areas planned for tubewell installation promising results observed for as and mn in the intermediate depth monitoring piezometers and expecting a similar hydro chemical buffer zone within a reasonable distance from the piezometers drinking water tubewells were installed at a targeted depth of 120 m within the adjacent mauzas the smallest mappable unit a mauza is a type of administrative unit that corresponds to specific land area and includes all kinds of land use pattern within that area which may include settlements agricultural lands water bodies forests etc mauza maps are important for delineating and or demarcating the ownerships of land and also for the collection of revenue a mauza includes one or more villages and the demographic census are conducted village wise although villages are not mappable units secondary information collected analyzed and mapped for the whole study area matlab region focusing current safe water access and the livelihood favored the installation of idtw mainly in north matlab the occurrence of red and off white sediments which can be easily identified and targeted for installation of as safe tubewells are also rare in north matlab excepting the southern fringe although those wells produce water with elevated mn the highlighted areas in fig 2 show the intervention areas that were given priority for social mapping and collection of other relevant demographic information for optimizing the sites for tubewell installation 2 3 site selection for tubewell installation within the selected intervention areas social mapping was done to collect information on the number of households hh livelihood status rich medium poor and ultra poor available water option and whether they are as safe or not etc locations of the clusters of hh locally called bari khan et al 2009 together with water option information were plotted on google image fig s2 average population per hh in rural areas of bangladesh is 4 36 and 4 6 in matlab bbs 2011 spatial distribution of the baris along with the collected information on current safe water access and the targeted number of beneficiaries were taken into consideration for optimizing the sites for tubewell installation in selecting the final sites for well installation priority was given to the areas of high demand poor people s inability and identified patients if any a field visit was done to find the most suitable location for the tubewell so that all hhs within the targeted beneficiaries can easily access the tubewell for collecting water table s2 provides a list of the targeted nests and the number of villages around the respective nests along with the number of beneficiaries hh and population in total 245 tubewells were installed among which 220 sites were selected in a planned manner around nine piezometer nests in north matlab another 25 sites were selected randomly among which 21 were installed in south matlab total number of targeted beneficiaries was 19 699 people from 3308 hhs exact location of the selected sites in each village intervened were recorded using hand held gps 2 4 installation of tubewells sediment sample collection and characterization for the installation of tubewells borings were done with a target depth of 120 m in all selected sites rotary reverse circulation drilling technology with which local tubewell drillers are acquainted was used locally this drilling method used for the drinking water tubewell installation is known as the donkey drilling method with an objective for recording the vertical profile of clay and sand for delineating aquifer and aquitard sediment samples were collected from each 1 5 m section throughout the entire depth up to 120 m sediment samples were then visually examined for the characterization of mainly grain size and also the color taking the local practice of boring and installation into account size of the sediment grains were determined with the aid of visual inspection for documenting color visually observed colors of the wet samples were recorded as additional information they were also compared with the munsell color chart and each sediment was assigned with unique color code for sediment colors black white off white and red as perceived and used by the local tubewell drillers as detailed out in hossain et al 2014 2017 2 5 monitoring of groundwater level groundwater levels vary seasonally and with the abstraction of water from the aquifer system monitoring of groundwater conditions for an area during the dry season is more important since the use of this resource increases with irrigation this can result in loss of domestic water supply wells and unavailability or reduced availability of surface water depth to groundwater is crucial during the driest period of the year and is considered as an essential parameter to design and decide the type of the tubewell to be installed to ensure water supply of an area throughout the year hydraulic head measurements from the intermediate depth piezometers at the end of the 2011 dry period were converted to produce two maps depth to groundwater from the surface and groundwater elevation above mean sea level fig s4 2 6 groundwater sampling and analysis following the procedure as described by bhattacharya et al 2002a groundwater samples from 243 idtw were collected during april may 2012 to ensure the results from representative samples of the actual groundwater flow each well was purged before measurements of on site parameters and collection of water samples temperature electrical conductivity ec ph and redox potential eh were measured using the portable field meters which were calibrated once daily before taking the measurements details of sampling accuracy and precision of the results and replicate analysis are available in supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrostratigraphy within the targeted depth of 120 m three aquifers and two aquitards were encountered variations in the geometry of the aquifers and aquitards with respect to depth and thickness were observed in different intervention areas based on the analysis of all the borelogs a generalized description of all the hydrostratigraphic units with depth and thickness is presented in table 1 the depth ranges indicate the minimum and maximum depth from ground surface at which different units were encountered topsoil with an average thickness of 5 6 m exists in most places excepting a few locations in the central part of the study area these villages are kashimnagar maisadi and char latardi village around nest 10 similar condition was also observed in rarikandi village in the intervention area of nest 6 targeted sand layer where the well filters were installed mostly consists of medium sands which are light grey in color spatial variability of the depth to aquifers and aquitards along with the thickness of the respective hydrostratigraphic units calculated from all borelogs are presented in fig s3 and table s3 3 2 depth to groundwater and groundwater flow in the study area depth to groundwater during the dry periods of the year was observed to be mostly within depth of 7 m from ground surface fig s4a this depth is within the suction limit of conventional hand tubewell known as nr 6 pump which allows easy pumping of water by the end users this observation was an added consideration for emphasizing the use of the north matlab area for the installation of idtw groundwater flows towards the southeast fig s4b which roughly follows the slope of surface topography in the study area in addition hydraulic separation of ida from the shallow contaminated aquifers evident from the long term monitoring of hydraulic heads conducted by a parallel study hossain 2015 favor the sustainability of these ida for the installation of safe drinking water tubewells 3 3 arsenic and manganese and their spatial variability following the description of intervention areas outlined in fig 2 and supplementary table s2 the results for as and mn are presented in table 2 which gives a statistical summary of the success of hit rate within each intervention area around the respective monitoring piezometer nest among the 243 idtws 240 wells 98 8 were found to be as safe arsenic concentration in groundwater abstracted from 222 idtw 91 4 were found within the who guideline who 2011 value of 10 μg l among which as concentration was below the detection limit bdl of 3 91 μg l in 198 wells 81 5 taking the detection limit as the concentration of all the bdl samples mean and median values for as stands as 6 2 and 3 9 μg l respectively bangladesh drinking water standard bdws for as of 50 μg l exceeded only in three tubewells around nests 6 and 13 manganese concentration in groundwater collected from 217 tubewells 89 3 is within the former who guideline of 0 4 mg l table 2 considering both as and mn more than 81 n 197 of the wells comply with the who guideline values although most of the idtws installed are as safe and low in mn some wells installed in the south matlab area and along the southern fringes of the north matlab area fig 3 b d contain elevated amount of mn exceeded by a little margin compared to previous who guideline mean and median value of mn for such tubewells stand 0 8 and 0 6 mg l respectively fig 3c and d provide the spatial distribution of as and mn over the study area at a depth of 120 m where the idtws were installed 3 4 ph eh and redox sensitive parameters ida groundwaters are characterized with relatively low eh mn doc hco3 nh4 n and po4 p table 3 and fig 4 groundwater phs in the idtw were circum neutral with a mean and median value of 6 9 and 6 8 respectively the measured eh in these groundwater was found to be significantly lower compared to the eh observed in shallow tubewells installed in dark grey black sediments in the same area hossain et al 2014 where the redox potential favours reductive dissolution of iron hydro oxy oxides to release as into the groundwater system while the current eh ph values fall close to the arsenite arsenate boundary in an eh ph diagram it is odd that more reducing conditions in the dark grey sediments gave higher values however it should be remembered that eh measurements are often questionable due to slow kinetics degree of redox equilibrium microbial involvement etc hossain et al 2014 studied the detailed groundwater chemistry of the shallow aquifers of the same study area in that study doc and hco3 of ida groundwaters were also low even lower than reported for the as safe groundwaters produced from red offwhite brown oxidized sediments a wide range of iron concentration fe total was observed with a median value of 2 3 mg l however the concentration of fe was somewhat moderate compared to those observed from water of reduced and oxidized sediments hossain et al 2014 sulphate so4 concentration in general is low in the matlab groundwaters in ida water it is somewhat in between those in black and red sediments po4 p was found to be very low although low eh indicates highly anoxic water low doc and hco3 were probably not favourable for driving the release of as in groundwater through a reductive dissolution process 3 5 major ions trace elements and water quality sodium chloride and bicarbonate constitute the major ion composition of ida groundwaters reflected from the box and whiskers plot fig 4 table 4 provides the mean and median values for all major ions calculated from wells installed cluster wise in different intervention areas and a very similar result in mean and median values indicate a similar hydrochemical buffer in the intervention area s around the respective nest with a very low concentration of sulphate groundwater samples are predominantly na cl hco3 to na ca mg cl hco3 type fig 5 spatial variation in water types was evident from the results of aquachem model outputs used for the construction of box plot and piper diagram variability in water types resulted from the major ion composition indicate the variation in the local hydrogeological condition although the two important water quality parameters as and mn concentration remained within a very narrow range within safe limits in compliance to drinking water guidelines and standards in the upstream area in the northwest and north central around nests 7 13 and 12 na cl hco3 is the dominant water type gradually this changes to a mixed type na ca mg cl hco3 to na ca mg hco3 in the middle areas by the enhancement of ca and mg due to probable dissolution of calcite and dolomite and changes again to na ca cl and na ca cl hco3 most likely due to the influence of relict sea water von brömssen et al 2007 in the southeast the mean and median concentrations of chloride cl are 250 and 220 mg l which are very much within the range of the bangladesh drinking water standard of 150 600 mg l chloride has been listed as a parameter not of health concern at levels found in drinking water in who 2011 although the standard value listed by us epa epa 2003 and eu council european council 1998 is 250 mg l nitrate was found to be very low in concentration contributions of na ca mg k and hco3 to the total dissolved solids tds in ida groundwaters has been observed to be lower than that in the shallow aquifers in the same study area hossain et al 2014 most of the wells had fluoride concentrations below the who drinking water guideline of 1 5 mg l with a mean value of 0 38 mg l for b a mean concentration of 0 22 mg l was observed many of the other trace elements such as cd co cr mo ni pb zr were low in concentration in most of the samples for compliance with drinking water quality a comparison with guidelines and standards table 5 provides details of all major ions and trace elements measured for ida groundwaters which indicate these waters are good for consumption 3 6 scaling up of safe water access eventually installation of all the idtw in a systematic approach taking the relevant social aspects into account created an improvement in the safe water access scenario providing as safe water to 19 536 people in some areas before intervention the condition was so severe that there was no as safe tubewell in 17 villages and in another area there was only one as safe tubewell in 5 villages with a total population of 1641 based on the number of as safe tubewells for a certain number of populations such as one as safe tubewell accessible by 50 100 500 and above 500 people a significant improvement in safe water access fig 6 has been achieved through the installation of idtw 4 conclusions the discovery of the pattern of as safe and low mn groundwater from the newly explored aquifers ida has emerged as a potential source for the installation of safe drinking water tubewells availability of similar hydrogeochemical and geological conditions at this depth range could be targeted by local tubewell drillers at almost half the cost of deep tubewell installation and hence seems quite encouraging for the local community considering their affordability for installation of tubewell by their own initiative a similar approach and strategy appears to be replicable in wider areas in bangladesh for scaling up safe water access and also in other places having the similar geological environment besides the technical aspects this finding also holds significance in policy and implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

installation cost which is beyond the affordability of local communities especially for the poor and disadvantaged section of society in the context of safe drinking water supplies when managing arsenic is still far from a reality elevated mn in groundwater has made the situation even more critical in addition to as bgs dphe studies bgs 2001 included mn as an element of health concern their survey results available from tubewells ranging from 7 to 362 m depth provide a very low 0 001 mg l mn content to as high as 9 98 mg l compared with who guideline who 2004 58 of their results are within and remaining 42 exceed the guideline value of 0 4 mg l distinctly different regional patterns for as and mn fig 1 a and b have also been indicated by bgs dphe survey hasan et al 2007 investigated three different physiographic settings of bangladesh namely ganges flood plain gfp meghna flood plain mfp and ganges delta plain gdp on the basis of hydrochemical characterization of groundwater samples collected from the shallow tubewells within the depth range of 80 m in their studies none of these three units was found suitable when both as and mn are considered together for the installation of shallow drinking water tubewells red and off white sands could be a good source for tapping as safe water biswas et al 2012 hossain et al 2014 von brömssen et al 2007 but elevated mn in those aquifers is a concern in the context of the drinking water safety plan who 2004 moreover these oxidized sediments are not available in all as affected places throughout the country johnston et al 2014 discussed enhancing arsenic mitigation in bangladesh based on the findings from institutional psychological and technical investigations with the reference of groundwater models and field studies they indicated that in the great majority of the as affected areas although the risk of as contamination in deep groundwater is small mn fe and salinity could pose water quality problems in central and northern bangladesh exceedance of mn by health based value of 0 4 mg l is frequent bbs 2011 who 2011 high concentration of mn between 2 and 5 mg l from as safe deep tubewells installed at depths from 190 to 240 m in sreenagar of munshiganj district in south central bangladesh has been reported by hug et al 2011 elevated mn along with as has also been reported from murshidabad west bengal india sankar et al 2014 in the context of mitigation management plan red stained platform was found to be useful for identifying high as tubewells whereas expected black discoloration for mn was found to be masked by red discoloration caused from fe oxides annaduzzaman et al 2018 depth specific piezometer nests were installed at 15 locations in the matlab area spread over 410 km2 fig 2 for monitoring the behavior of groundwater system mainly hydraulic heads and water chemistry hossain 2015 hossain et al 2014 in terms of relative depth these monitoring wells were grouped into shallow intermediate and deep piezometers in most of the nests four shallow wells were installed within the depth range of 70 m one was completed deeper in the intermediate depth at about 115 m and deep well was put at a depth of about 235 m based on observations of low as and mn from those piezometers installed at intermediate depths designated as intermediate deep aquifers ida hossain 2015 245 drinking water tubewells herein termed as intermediate deep tubewells idtw were installed to expand the exploration around the piezometer nests at a targeted depth of 120 m for exploiting as safe and low mn water to provide water supply in the study area this study pioneers the exploration and exploitation of the intermediate resources between shallow and deep systems for the first time in the country the aim of this study is to create and share results on the suitability of ida in the context of as mn and other relevant water quality parameters so that the potentiality of this unexploited aquifer can be used as a new horizon for the installation of hand tubewells for safe drinking water along with as and mn pattern this study makes hydrochemical characterization of the intermediate deep system focusing the redox sensitive parameters major ions and trace elements taking detailed water chemistry into account as well as the depth to groundwater required for abstraction of groundwater through conventional hand tubewells this article focuses on how this strategy could be helpful for scaling up safe water access 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the matlab region divided into north and south supplementary fig s1 is situated within the chandpur district in southeastern bangladesh between 23015 0 and 23030 0 n latitude and 90034 0 and 90049 0 e longitude covers an area of 410 km2 with a total population of more than half a million agriculture is the main land use pattern and the principal means of livelihood some basic demographic information are provided in supplementary table s1 considering the rainfall records for the period from 1981 to 2012 the total annual rainfall at the nearest chandpur station is 2175 mm bbs 2013 geomophologically the study area is classified as deltaic plains constituted by meghna flood plain in the west and chandina deltaic plain in the east bakr 1977 morgan and mcintire 1959 the river meghna and its tributaries formed deposits composed of clay silt and sand with similar lithologic characteristics found in the more oxidized and compacted chandina formation 2 2 intervention areas planned for tubewell installation promising results observed for as and mn in the intermediate depth monitoring piezometers and expecting a similar hydro chemical buffer zone within a reasonable distance from the piezometers drinking water tubewells were installed at a targeted depth of 120 m within the adjacent mauzas the smallest mappable unit a mauza is a type of administrative unit that corresponds to specific land area and includes all kinds of land use pattern within that area which may include settlements agricultural lands water bodies forests etc mauza maps are important for delineating and or demarcating the ownerships of land and also for the collection of revenue a mauza includes one or more villages and the demographic census are conducted village wise although villages are not mappable units secondary information collected analyzed and mapped for the whole study area matlab region focusing current safe water access and the livelihood favored the installation of idtw mainly in north matlab the occurrence of red and off white sediments which can be easily identified and targeted for installation of as safe tubewells are also rare in north matlab excepting the southern fringe although those wells produce water with elevated mn the highlighted areas in fig 2 show the intervention areas that were given priority for social mapping and collection of other relevant demographic information for optimizing the sites for tubewell installation 2 3 site selection for tubewell installation within the selected intervention areas social mapping was done to collect information on the number of households hh livelihood status rich medium poor and ultra poor available water option and whether they are as safe or not etc locations of the clusters of hh locally called bari khan et al 2009 together with water option information were plotted on google image fig s2 average population per hh in rural areas of bangladesh is 4 36 and 4 6 in matlab bbs 2011 spatial distribution of the baris along with the collected information on current safe water access and the targeted number of beneficiaries were taken into consideration for optimizing the sites for tubewell installation in selecting the final sites for well installation priority was given to the areas of high demand poor people s inability and identified patients if any a field visit was done to find the most suitable location for the tubewell so that all hhs within the targeted beneficiaries can easily access the tubewell for collecting water table s2 provides a list of the targeted nests and the number of villages around the respective nests along with the number of beneficiaries hh and population in total 245 tubewells were installed among which 220 sites were selected in a planned manner around nine piezometer nests in north matlab another 25 sites were selected randomly among which 21 were installed in south matlab total number of targeted beneficiaries was 19 699 people from 3308 hhs exact location of the selected sites in each village intervened were recorded using hand held gps 2 4 installation of tubewells sediment sample collection and characterization for the installation of tubewells borings were done with a target depth of 120 m in all selected sites rotary reverse circulation drilling technology with which local tubewell drillers are acquainted was used locally this drilling method used for the drinking water tubewell installation is known as the donkey drilling method with an objective for recording the vertical profile of clay and sand for delineating aquifer and aquitard sediment samples were collected from each 1 5 m section throughout the entire depth up to 120 m sediment samples were then visually examined for the characterization of mainly grain size and also the color taking the local practice of boring and installation into account size of the sediment grains were determined with the aid of visual inspection for documenting color visually observed colors of the wet samples were recorded as additional information they were also compared with the munsell color chart and each sediment was assigned with unique color code for sediment colors black white off white and red as perceived and used by the local tubewell drillers as detailed out in hossain et al 2014 2017 2 5 monitoring of groundwater level groundwater levels vary seasonally and with the abstraction of water from the aquifer system monitoring of groundwater conditions for an area during the dry season is more important since the use of this resource increases with irrigation this can result in loss of domestic water supply wells and unavailability or reduced availability of surface water depth to groundwater is crucial during the driest period of the year and is considered as an essential parameter to design and decide the type of the tubewell to be installed to ensure water supply of an area throughout the year hydraulic head measurements from the intermediate depth piezometers at the end of the 2011 dry period were converted to produce two maps depth to groundwater from the surface and groundwater elevation above mean sea level fig s4 2 6 groundwater sampling and analysis following the procedure as described by bhattacharya et al 2002a groundwater samples from 243 idtw were collected during april may 2012 to ensure the results from representative samples of the actual groundwater flow each well was purged before measurements of on site parameters and collection of water samples temperature electrical conductivity ec ph and redox potential eh were measured using the portable field meters which were calibrated once daily before taking the measurements details of sampling accuracy and precision of the results and replicate analysis are available in supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrostratigraphy within the targeted depth of 120 m three aquifers and two aquitards were encountered variations in the geometry of the aquifers and aquitards with respect to depth and thickness were observed in different intervention areas based on the analysis of all the borelogs a generalized description of all the hydrostratigraphic units with depth and thickness is presented in table 1 the depth ranges indicate the minimum and maximum depth from ground surface at which different units were encountered topsoil with an average thickness of 5 6 m exists in most places excepting a few locations in the central part of the study area these villages are kashimnagar maisadi and char latardi village around nest 10 similar condition was also observed in rarikandi village in the intervention area of nest 6 targeted sand layer where the well filters were installed mostly consists of medium sands which are light grey in color spatial variability of the depth to aquifers and aquitards along with the thickness of the respective hydrostratigraphic units calculated from all borelogs are presented in fig s3 and table s3 3 2 depth to groundwater and groundwater flow in the study area depth to groundwater during the dry periods of the year was observed to be mostly within depth of 7 m from ground surface fig s4a this depth is within the suction limit of conventional hand tubewell known as nr 6 pump which allows easy pumping of water by the end users this observation was an added consideration for emphasizing the use of the north matlab area for the installation of idtw groundwater flows towards the southeast fig s4b which roughly follows the slope of surface topography in the study area in addition hydraulic separation of ida from the shallow contaminated aquifers evident from the long term monitoring of hydraulic heads conducted by a parallel study hossain 2015 favor the sustainability of these ida for the installation of safe drinking water tubewells 3 3 arsenic and manganese and their spatial variability following the description of intervention areas outlined in fig 2 and supplementary table s2 the results for as and mn are presented in table 2 which gives a statistical summary of the success of hit rate within each intervention area around the respective monitoring piezometer nest among the 243 idtws 240 wells 98 8 were found to be as safe arsenic concentration in groundwater abstracted from 222 idtw 91 4 were found within the who guideline who 2011 value of 10 μg l among which as concentration was below the detection limit bdl of 3 91 μg l in 198 wells 81 5 taking the detection limit as the concentration of all the bdl samples mean and median values for as stands as 6 2 and 3 9 μg l respectively bangladesh drinking water standard bdws for as of 50 μg l exceeded only in three tubewells around nests 6 and 13 manganese concentration in groundwater collected from 217 tubewells 89 3 is within the former who guideline of 0 4 mg l table 2 considering both as and mn more than 81 n 197 of the wells comply with the who guideline values although most of the idtws installed are as safe and low in mn some wells installed in the south matlab area and along the southern fringes of the north matlab area fig 3 b d contain elevated amount of mn exceeded by a little margin compared to previous who guideline mean and median value of mn for such tubewells stand 0 8 and 0 6 mg l respectively fig 3c and d provide the spatial distribution of as and mn over the study area at a depth of 120 m where the idtws were installed 3 4 ph eh and redox sensitive parameters ida groundwaters are characterized with relatively low eh mn doc hco3 nh4 n and po4 p table 3 and fig 4 groundwater phs in the idtw were circum neutral with a mean and median value of 6 9 and 6 8 respectively the measured eh in these groundwater was found to be significantly lower compared to the eh observed in shallow tubewells installed in dark grey black sediments in the same area hossain et al 2014 where the redox potential favours reductive dissolution of iron hydro oxy oxides to release as into the groundwater system while the current eh ph values fall close to the arsenite arsenate boundary in an eh ph diagram it is odd that more reducing conditions in the dark grey sediments gave higher values however it should be remembered that eh measurements are often questionable due to slow kinetics degree of redox equilibrium microbial involvement etc hossain et al 2014 studied the detailed groundwater chemistry of the shallow aquifers of the same study area in that study doc and hco3 of ida groundwaters were also low even lower than reported for the as safe groundwaters produced from red offwhite brown oxidized sediments a wide range of iron concentration fe total was observed with a median value of 2 3 mg l however the concentration of fe was somewhat moderate compared to those observed from water of reduced and oxidized sediments hossain et al 2014 sulphate so4 concentration in general is low in the matlab groundwaters in ida water it is somewhat in between those in black and red sediments po4 p was found to be very low although low eh indicates highly anoxic water low doc and hco3 were probably not favourable for driving the release of as in groundwater through a reductive dissolution process 3 5 major ions trace elements and water quality sodium chloride and bicarbonate constitute the major ion composition of ida groundwaters reflected from the box and whiskers plot fig 4 table 4 provides the mean and median values for all major ions calculated from wells installed cluster wise in different intervention areas and a very similar result in mean and median values indicate a similar hydrochemical buffer in the intervention area s around the respective nest with a very low concentration of sulphate groundwater samples are predominantly na cl hco3 to na ca mg cl hco3 type fig 5 spatial variation in water types was evident from the results of aquachem model outputs used for the construction of box plot and piper diagram variability in water types resulted from the major ion composition indicate the variation in the local hydrogeological condition although the two important water quality parameters as and mn concentration remained within a very narrow range within safe limits in compliance to drinking water guidelines and standards in the upstream area in the northwest and north central around nests 7 13 and 12 na cl hco3 is the dominant water type gradually this changes to a mixed type na ca mg cl hco3 to na ca mg hco3 in the middle areas by the enhancement of ca and mg due to probable dissolution of calcite and dolomite and changes again to na ca cl and na ca cl hco3 most likely due to the influence of relict sea water von brömssen et al 2007 in the southeast the mean and median concentrations of chloride cl are 250 and 220 mg l which are very much within the range of the bangladesh drinking water standard of 150 600 mg l chloride has been listed as a parameter not of health concern at levels found in drinking water in who 2011 although the standard value listed by us epa epa 2003 and eu council european council 1998 is 250 mg l nitrate was found to be very low in concentration contributions of na ca mg k and hco3 to the total dissolved solids tds in ida groundwaters has been observed to be lower than that in the shallow aquifers in the same study area hossain et al 2014 most of the wells had fluoride concentrations below the who drinking water guideline of 1 5 mg l with a mean value of 0 38 mg l for b a mean concentration of 0 22 mg l was observed many of the other trace elements such as cd co cr mo ni pb zr were low in concentration in most of the samples for compliance with drinking water quality a comparison with guidelines and standards table 5 provides details of all major ions and trace elements measured for ida groundwaters which indicate these waters are good for consumption 3 6 scaling up of safe water access eventually installation of all the idtw in a systematic approach taking the relevant social aspects into account created an improvement in the safe water access scenario providing as safe water to 19 536 people in some areas before intervention the condition was so severe that there was no as safe tubewell in 17 villages and in another area there was only one as safe tubewell in 5 villages with a total population of 1641 based on the number of as safe tubewells for a certain number of populations such as one as safe tubewell accessible by 50 100 500 and above 500 people a significant improvement in safe water access fig 6 has been achieved through the installation of idtw 4 conclusions the discovery of the pattern of as safe and low mn groundwater from the newly explored aquifers ida has emerged as a potential source for the installation of safe drinking water tubewells availability of similar hydrogeochemical and geological conditions at this depth range could be targeted by local tubewell drillers at almost half the cost of deep tubewell installation and hence seems quite encouraging for the local community considering their affordability for installation of tubewell by their own initiative a similar approach and strategy appears to be replicable in wider areas in bangladesh for scaling up safe water access and also in other places having the similar geological environment besides the technical aspects this finding also holds significance in policy and implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

11686,fully 3d and multidimensional geological models are key for energy mining and water resources assessment and management which has a great economic impact 3d geological models provide critical information regarding geometric properties of the geological bodies of interest such as ore deposits or reservoirs allowing inference of volumes and availability to be exploited however defining a useful methodology to create a fully digital 3d geological model of volcanic islands is still very challenging due to the intrinsic complexity observed in the structure of volcanic systems two dimensional geological maps associated vertical geological cross sectional diagrams and borehole and water mining tunnels galleries logs were examined on el hierro island a geological modelling procedure using the software geomodeller obtained the first 3d geological model of el hierro volcanic island as a basis for volcanic formation definitions and geometric analysis surface volume and center of mass estimations of the differentiated sub units allowed a better understanding of the spatial distribution and evolution of the volcanic cycles of el hierro island over time the 3d model provided geometry information correlatable with volcanic activity cycles and lava pyroclast deposition mechanisms that ultimately defines the geometry of the volcanic units this information provides new variables valuable for the investigation of the existing relationships between rift zones and giant lateral collapses in addition the obtained 3d geological model of a volcanic island will support the building of the first hydrogeological and geothermal model of el hierro island allowing advancement of sustainability of isolated systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords 3d geological model el hierro island canary islands rift zones giant landslides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the largest unfrozen freshwater reservoir on earth underpinning human development and important ecosystems eamus et al 2016 gleeson et al 2020 it supplies approximately two billion people with drinking water worldwide morris et al 2003 and satisfies 40 of the global irrigation demand siebert et al 2010 groundwater resources in arid and semi arid regions are suffering from depletion due to increasing demands and limited recharge rates scanlon et al 2006 in these regions where surface water resources are scarce or absent islanders are forced to rely up to 95 on groundwater resources to provide fresh water for human consumption agriculture and livestock duncan 2012 this combination of factors is what has made efficient management of freshwater resources and policy establishment a major challenge for the authorities of these islands tribble 2008 white and falkland 2010 furthermore heterogeneity and anisotropy in volcanic oceanic islands have been recognized as major factors conditioning resource assessment and planning custodio et al 2016 santamarta et al 2014 although most volcanic rock formations are considered poorly permeable productive aquifers can be found in quaternary volcanic rocks when an alternation of fissured lavas and porous pyroclasts are found margat and van der gun 2013 volcanic formations possess characteristic geometries compared with sedimentary deposits due to the endogenous processes which generate them solidification of magma lava and pyroclastic deposition these volcanic structures developed in volcanic zones are linked to lava composition and type of eruption thus conditioning groundwater flow regimes singhal and gupta 2010 significant volcanic structures that condition groundwater flow in volcanic islands include extensive layering produced by successive eruptions dykes extending several kilometres volcanic edifices submarine basalts and massive landslides custodio 2020 the central part of volcanic islands is characterized by a swarm of vertical dykes low permeability cutting across the lava flows and acting as barriers against groundwater flow towards the sea thereby forming water compartments at different heights lachassagne et al 2014 therefore the heterogeneity inherent to volcanic island geology is required to understand groundwater flow in such environments in particular these heterogeneities have been considered critical in hydrogeological studies of volcanic islands worldwide in the atlantic ocean including the macaronesia archipelagos such as azores garcía gil et al 2022 madeira prada et al 2005 canary islands garcía gil et al 2022 cape verde lopes et al 2022 and the lesser antilles hemmings et al 2015 in the pacific ocean such as the hawaiian islands lachassagne et al 2014 the galapagos islands violette et al 2014 and most of the islands of oceania hughes et al 2022 and in the indian ocean in islands such as comoros comte et al 2016 reunion join et al 2016 and mauritius povinec et al 2012 hydrogeological characterization of volcanic aquifers in oceanic islands requires sophisticated technical and methodological instruments including the use of remote sensors el rayes et al 2020 specific mathematical models herrera and custodio 2014 and geostatistical methods derived from pseudo regional hydraulic tests poncela et al 2022 historically hydrogeologists have coped with heterogeneity in natural porous media using spatially distributed numerical modelling anderson et al 2015 distributed models can be valuable tools because they have the ability to take the subsurface heterogeneity into account and provide distributed output variables dehotin and braud 2008 however spatially distributed models require 3d geological models to provide spatial discretization of the numerical model domain thus accounting for existing heterogeneities numerical models in hydrogeology have progressively incorporated 3d geological models for the evaluation of groundwater capacity and vulnerability to depict aquifers and their properties at local regional or national scales maccormack et al 2019 turner et al 2021 using 3d geological modelling as a basis for hydrogeological research in volcanic environments has been proven to provide a significant improvement of groundwater resource assessments as it allows reducing geometry and parametrization uncertainty of the aquifers gill et al 2011 although the geology of volcanoes has been extensively researched in previous works bonforte et al 2022 cas et al 2018 macdonald et al 1983 schmincke 2004 references on 3d geological model building are scarce and limited to the island of weh to our knowledge nugraha and o sullivan 2019 weh is a young volcanic island located in the northern part of the great sumatra fault system indonesia the authors developed a 3d geological model with the commercial software leapfrog to define a geothermal reservoir of the jaboi geothermal area the obtained geological model resulted to be a very useful 3d visualization tool and compiled all of the geological and geothermal exploration data obtained to date geological structures rock types water level and surface manifestations in this paper we present the first 3d geological model of el hierro volcanic island as a basis for hydrogeological and geothermal research the main objective of this work is to propose and apply a methodology to build a fully digital 3d geological model of the volcanic island consistent with a 20 year old set of paper geological maps by the geological survey of spain igme csic and other datasets described below the second objective of this work is to provide suitable metadata about the 3d geological model of el hierro island making it available to potential users and informing them about its specifications and its uncertainties the methodology presented to develop a 3d geological model of volcanic islands will support the building of the first hydrogeological and geothermal model of el hierro island this will allow reproduction of groundwater flow and transport processes of solutes and heat at an insular scale the simulations obtained from this model will improve the hydrogeological knowledge of this volcanic island and thus advance knowledge about aquifer vulnerability in volcanic islands in addition to creating strategies for adaptation to climate change reproducing heat transport in the subsurface will allow to investigate the shallow geothermal potential and its renewability due to groundwater advection of heat will be investigated 2 study area the canary islands archipelago is the emerged part of the canary volcanic province which is composed of seven main islands and several islets as well as the associated seamounts the archipelago is found in the eastern atlantic ocean region 28 n 16 w 100 km from the african coast fig 1 the island of el hierro is the youngest most western and southern island of the canary archipelago it has a total emerged area of 268 7 km2 and a maximum altitude of 1501 m a s l meters above mean sea level a total of 58 of its surface is environmentally protected and in 2000 the whole island became a unesco biosphere reserve in addition the entire island of el hierro was also classed as a unesco global geopark in 2014 a very characteristic morphological feature of oceanic volcanic islands is its shape a truncated triangular pyramid with three alignments corresponding to a classic 120 spaced volcanic rift system coalescing in its central sector where it reaches its maximum altitude island summit without a doubt the most outstanding geological relief on the island is the impressive el golfo valley officially recognized as one of the global geosites igme 2022 it originated almost instantly after the mobilization of some 180 km3 of the northern flank of the island both in its subaerial and submarine portion producing a 14 5 km wide depression limited by a semi circular escarpment which has a maximum height of 1100 m in its central sector the hydrogeology of el hierro and its groundwater supply systems have been extensively studied by santamarta 2017 and santamarta and rodríguez martín 2020 describing the geological structures involved in the movement and storage of water in the island aquifer comparing it with the hawaiian islands the oldest subaerial rocks of el hierro are dated at 1 12 myr guillou et al 1996 and the geology is representative of a volcanic oceanic island in its initial phase of shield development most of the island is covered by cinder cones and recent lava flows as surface expressions of emission vents fed by aligned dyke swarms the steep topographic hillsides are scarcely affected by erosive gullies the internal structure of the island is formed by overlapping volcanic edifices that successively developed and collapsed the collapses of the volcanic edifices are caused by giant landslides located between volcanic rift arms resulting in horseshoe shaped embayments troll and carracedo 2016 based on stratigraphic and radiometric data abdel monem et al 1972 guillou et al 1996 perez torrado et al 2011 three large superimposed volcanoes have been identified as result of subaerial activity in the island the tiñor the el golfo and the recent rift volcano fig 1 the tiñor volcano 1 12 0 88 myr is the first subaerial volcanic edifice and its outcrops are found in the northeast part of the island as well as the las playas inlet three main construction phases have been distinguished defining three lithological sub units fig 1 the lower section the tabular section and the ventejís volcanic group while the first two phases correspond to fluid lavas transitioning from steeply dipping to sub horizontal flows the third phase corresponds to the most explosive activity stage of the edifice presenting emission vents with well preserved wide craters troll and carracedo 2016 the lower and tabular sections are constituted by alkaline basaltic emissions intensely affected by phyllonian rocks and alternating with intercalated pyroclastic levels lapilli and volcanic slag the latter intercalations increase towards the end of the lithostratigraphic unit in the ventejís area where a complex stratovolcano is observed igme 1997a the tiñor edifice growth was rapid and uninterrupted this is characteristic of the first stages of any volcanic island development and it typically results in major flank instability due to accompaniament by magmatic and pore fluid pressurisation triggered by the dyke emplacement elsworth and voight 1995 the tiñor volcano cycle ended with a giant landslide where the western flank of the tiñor edifice collapsed currently the associated landslide scar is hidden by the subsequent emissions of the el golfo edifice and by the volcanism of the rifts fig 2 a cross section 1 and fig 2b cross section 2 the el golfo edifice 545 175 kyr arose approximately 350 kyr after the western flank of the tiñor edifice collapsed it developed entirely in the brunhes epoch nestled in the slide of the tiñor edifice forming an angular unconformity that overlaps the remains of the tiñor volcano thus extending the island to the west morphological differences and local unconformities in the el golfo volcanic edifice allow identification of three sub units fig 1 the lower section the upper middle section and the upper section the lower section is mainly composed of strombolian pyroclasts with subordinate presence of basaltic lava flows materials related to explosive eruptions with surtseyan cinder cones and tuff rings this section is cut by northeast east south east and west northwest trending dyke swarms which also configure the current volcanic vent systems the upper middle section of the el golfo edifice shows no clear discordance with the lower section indicating continuous emission the materials of the upper middle section also include basaltic lava flows but in this case with less dense dyke swarms and the presence of subordinated pyroclastic cones igme 1997a the upper section of the el golfo edifice consists of different block and ash deposits trachybasalts trachytes and differentiated lava flows which probably represents the last stages of the volcanic activity troll and carracedo 2016 during the final stages of the el golfo edifice construction a giant landslide occurred 176 kyr in the sw sector igme 1997c this is evidenced by a wide arc formed in the sw sector of the island the absence of the el golfo materials and the large pile of lavas released during the later ridge volcanism in the el julan area fig 2d cross section 4 furthermore the study carried out on the continental shelf by holcomb and searle 1991 shows the existence of avalanche deposits on the seafloor the third and last main volcano edifice of the island involves the recent rift volcanism 158 kyr which is made up of rift series lavas as the last volcanic stage in the island s growth it consists of strombolian cones located along the three arms of the rift resulting from simultaneous activity and lava emissions that cover the two previous volcano edifices the recent rift volcanism is the unit that occupies the largest area of the island it consists of basaltic lava flows that are mainly located over the el golfo edifice igme 1997b in the final eruptive phases of the rift volcanism during the upper pleistocene the ascending magma injection thrust into the upper part of the island produced a severe lithostatic breakdown this led to the destabilization and collapse of the el golfo edifice including the overlapping lava flows of the volcanism of the ridges generating a large horseshoe shaped embayment between the northern and western rift arms igme 1997c manconi et al 2009 this giant landslide profoundly altered the physiognomy of the island and is the most important morphological feature of el hierro fig 2c cross section 3 the collapse scar starts at an altitude of 1500 m a s l and ends up at 3200 m a s l and the mobilized materials are deposited 65 km off the coastline of the island covering 1500 km2 of seafloor masson et al 2002 troll and carracedo 2016 coetaneous to this event another landslide took place in the eastern part of the island affecting the las playas section gee et al 2001 masson et al 2002 the subsequent erosive action on the escarpment generated a large volume of detrital deposits at its base after the landslide at the el golfo area not the volcano different lava flows filled the formed depression whose emission centers were located on the steep slopes of the depression close to or within the structural axis where the greatest eruptive activity was concentrated at that time this volcanism was dominantly effusive with massive lava emissions that flowed towards the coastline filling the valley and reaching a thickness of 300 m in some places igme 1997c at the same time at the ends of the rift arms there were emissions of lava flows that overflowed the paleo cliffs of the tiñor and el golfo edifices giving rise to small coastal platforms called low islands these emissions have been assigned to sub recent and recent times and illustrate the continuous growth of the island around the structural axes igme 1997a igme 1997b recent sedimentary materials include colluvium deposits consisting of coarse detrital materials angular blocks cobbles and sands these materials are mostly associated with the las playas and el golfo escarpments located at the foot of these basaltic reliefs igme 1997c regarding the island s hydrogeology igme 1997c troll and carracedo 2016 the materials belonging to the tiñor edifice are made up of hard rocks of low permeability which have a low hydraulic conductivity and low storativity however these hard rocks are affected by a dense dyke swarm comprising fractured rocks that may show moderate to good secondary permeability depending on the fracturing degree and thus presenting high anisotropy the materials corresponding to el golfo volcano edifice present a high permeability due to their favourable low degree of alteration and compaction and they constitute the main aquifer of the island the materials associated with the activity in the rifts that correspond to the volcanism of the ridges the volcanism at el golfo area and the sub recent and recent emissions have not undergone alteration and will also tend to present high permeability 3 methodology 3 1 input data for the el hierro 3d geological model the datasets on geological information of el hierro island are mainly available as 2d maps and associated vertical geological cross sectional diagrams and borehole water mining tunnels galleries logs fig 3 most of this dataset proceeds from petrological geochronological abdel monem et al 1972 fúster et al 1993 and palaeomagnetic data guillou et al 1996 széréméta et al 1999 the data was obtained from geological sections showing the collapse scars and deep gullies the wells boreholes and water mining tunnel geological profiles in el golfo and the recent rift volcanoes concretely to build the presented 3d geological model of el hierro a total of five geological maps four 20 year old sets of paper geological maps at 1 25 000 scale from the spanish geological survey igme 1997a igme 1997b igme 1997c igme 1997d and one from troll and carracedo 2016 were considered the documentation associated with these maps included seven and five cross sections respectively which were also used for building the 3d model figs 2g and 3 in addition lithological profile descriptions of 15 773 m from 37 waterworks and boreholes were used as input in the 3d model fig 3 those included two high diameter 5 m canary wells 213 m total perforation 14 boreholes 2047 m 10 galleries 8139 m and 11 well galleries 5 374 m in the canary islands it is typical to find high diameter wells that go deep vertically or with a given angle until the perforation reaches the groundwater level and then the drilling turns horizontal or dips to low angles 5 all the direction changes and inclinations of the galleries and well galleries are available and described in the 3d geological model fig 3c the fourth primary source used to create the 3d geological model was the digital terrain model dtm the dtms obtained from the spain national geographic institute ign were created from the lidar point cloud with a density of 0 5 points per square meter with a root mean square error rmse in the z axis under 0 20 m 1 sigma cnig 2020 they consisted in a raster dataset with a horizontal cell resolution of 25 m and represented the land surface without any vegetation or buildings 3 2 el hierro 3d geological model workflow the workflow for building the 3d geological model of el hierro was initiated once all available input data existing and new data were collected and processed fig 3 by data compilation in the geomodeller software platform gibson et al 2013 this software makes use of the implicit geological modelling approach for the modelling of complex geological structures the code uses geological observations and or cartographic data to generate 3 d geological surfaces and volumes specifically it incorporates an algorithm calcagno et al 2008 lajaunie et al 1997 which applies cokriging to geological interfaces and orientation data obtained from structural fields to interpolate a continuous 3d potential field scalar function describing both the geology and geometry the software uses its own concept of geological pile to allow the aggregation of these boundaries and maintain stratigraphic relationships and fault network chronology the definition of a geological pile involves a given topology of the interfaces to characterize their spatial architecture without considering their chronological order after defining the fault geometry with specific potential fields the software calculates fault displacements from universal kriging calculations of the discontinuities finally the defined geological pile establishes spatial relationships between each individual model of each series to complete the 3 d model the geologic modelling procedure inside the geomodeller environment is synthetized in the following steps first a resolution of 10 m was adopted for the model and its domain was set by a bounding box of 29 25 6 km containing the whole island down to 3000 m b m s l meters below mean sea level then the dtm was prepared and imported into geomodeller to characterize the upper surface of the geological model after that the geological pile was defined to accomplish its modelling considering that the objective of the 3d geological model is to address groundwater management and geothermal potential estimations this project targeted the mapping of different hydrostratigraphic units to discretize rock porosity and permeability distributions the sequence of lithological formations to be created included the volcanic materials that allowed description and interpretation of the main three volcanos this geological pile allowed inclusion of mapping units and relevant known structures in a generalized geological model the different formation classification schemes used in each separate geological map sheet covered all the island and its harmonization to obtain at a single sequence the result of this harmonization is the units and sub units shown in fig 1 the geological pile definition was followed by preparation of surface geological data the maps were obtained in digital format fig 4 a the geological maps were georeferenced and then imported into geomodeller to manually digitalize the formation interfaces of the geological pile intersecting the topography orientation data and faults the vertical pre existing cross sections found in the literature and described above were edited to distinguish subsurface interfaces and orientations of the units defined in the geological pile of geomodeller fig 2 the adapted vertical cross section diagrams were cut and the start and end locations for the cross section were georeferenced before being imported into geomodeller fig 4b the cross sections provided interpretations of the three main volcano edifices including the pronounced faulting related to giant landslides once imported the correspondence between each topographic surface profile calculated by geomodeller and the topography represented on the georeferenced cross section was verified the 12 cross sections extracted from the literature fig 2g and adapted for the 3d model were distributed throughout the domain the next step was 3d projection of all borehole well and gallery geological profiles logs fig 4c these projections identifying the defined geological pile units were correlated by making use of 59 additional auxiliary cross sections fig 2g that ensured a fully 3d model interpolation robustness the final task before computing the 3d model consisted of checking through exhaustive 3d visualization the consistency between all surface and subsurface interface and orientation points borehole and gallery projections to be 3d interpolated 3 3 geometric analysis of el hierro main 3d geological units the obtained 3d geological model results for every sub unit were exported in the form of a 40 40 m horizontal x y grid data framework to understand the distribution of mass in the geological units the exported data set were used to calculate the center of mass of each subunit according to 1 r x r y r z r 1 m i 1 n m i r x i y i z i were r is the position vector of the center of mass with coordinates x r y r z r r is the position vector of the i th particle in the geological sub units of n particles m i is the mass of the i th particle and m is the total mass of the particles which was assumed constant since a density distribution map of the subunits was not available although giant landslides have affected the main volcano edifices of the island the centers of mass were calculated to evaluate possible similitudes and differences between geological bodies and discuss possible emission points of the volcanic materials in addition to centers of masses the slope distribution for each top shell of the different geological subunits was calculated this was calculated in the arcmap 10 esri 2011 environment the coordinate of the top shell points of each subunit was converted into rasters to run the slope tool spatial analyst v which allowed identification of the steepness at each cell of a raster surface calculated using the average maximum technique burrough et al 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 3d geological model and historical evolution of el hierro volcanic island a resume of the main geometrical parameters of the obtained 3d reconstruction of el hierro island is shown in table 1 the most spread materials are those related to the ridge volcanism with an extension of 182 5 km2 67 8 of the island surface followed by el golfo lower and middle sub units with 152 5 and 141 7 km2 respectively 56 7 and 52 7 respectively the tiñor edifice s sub units presented three to two times smaller than the ridge volcanism in terms of volume the middle and lower sub units of the el golfo edifice presented the largest values of 69 3 and 51 8 km3 representing 52 0 of the emerged island volume the following 29 8 of the emerged volume is mainly constituted by rifts materials associated with ridge volcanism 40 1 km3 and volcanism of el golfo 29 3 km3 sub units an additional 16 7 of the emerged volume is constituted by the tiñor edifice sub units in total the accumulated volume in all these described sub units accounts for 98 5 of the merged volume of the island the surface volume ratio showed a clear cyclicity along the material stacking at the main volcano edifices of tiñor and el golfo in the first stages the ratio was relatively large 0 23 0 53 and this drastically decreased to 0 05 0 09 in the last stages of volcanic activity of the main edifices in the last rifts cycle stages where mapped lava flow materials are shallow and local similar ratios below 0 10 were observed the obtained fully 3d geological model is shown in fig 5 a as 3d projected with opaque surfaces in geological sub units and transparent for the water body fig 5b presents the 3d wireframe view and fig 5c as a fence diagram with some cross sections intersecting the most important borehole and water gallery geological profiles the geometry of the geological sub units inside the island can be described according to the geological history of the island fig 6 the first main volcano edifice tiñor after its collapse and before las playas landslide is shown in fig 6a the paleorelief of the tiñor edifice was actuated as an underpin surface for the subsequent el golfo lava flows of the lower and middle sections the el golfo edifice is believed to have developed a 20 km diameter volcanic shield custodio 2020 before its multiple collapses through three major landslides el golfo el julan and las playas landslides the geological model allowed to fully 3d reconstruct its geometries fig 6b thanks to the 3d geological model and according to table 1 after its collapse the el golfo edifice still represented 52 6 of the emerged island volume which is 3 1 times the tiñor edifice fig 6c shows the ridge volcanism sub unit which was also affected by the later landslides this figure also shows how the stacking of these sub units configures the final scar of the giant landslide that destroyed the largest volcanic shield of the island to date and the circumstances previous to the volcanism of el golfo was emplaced in the decompressed area fig 6d finally fig 6e shows the recent and sub recent lava flow emissions together with minor sedimentary deposits 4 2 unravelling volcanism cycles from the 3d geological model of the el hierro island the calculated center of mass of each geological sub unit identified in the 3d geological model is shown in table 1 the elevation z coordinate of the center of mass of the sub units clearly shows the staking evolution within the major volcanic cycles with a positive increase of 99 412 m after the major collapse of each edifice the total accumulated increase of each edifice was 387 694 and 509 m for the tiñor el golfo and rifts edifices respectively the spatial descriptions of center of mass of the main sub units are shown in fig 7 the spatial changes of the center of mass of the tiñor edifice sub units show a clear linear 5 km drift ne with a 39 eastward deviation from the north fig 7a in addition vertical profiles in fig 7b and c show how the mass center of mass of the lower and tabular sub units presents similar horizontal coordinates while the center of mass of the ventejís sub unit increases those coordinates the rest of the centers of mass of the main geological sub units of the el golfo and rifts edifices are concentrated towards the west close to the three rift arms coalescence where the major elevations of the island are found differences among the centers of mass of these sub units fig 7d can be explained by the main el golfo landslide scar concave morphology which similarly affected the ridge volcanism and upper middle sub units vertical fault plane but not the lower section low angle fault plane fig 7e shows a linear dependency of the center of mass with respect to the x coordinate including the ridge volcanism sub unit although this sub unit is considered to be part of another volcanic cycle rifts edifice its geometry suggests a close relationship with the el golfo cycle the alignment of the centers of mass of the tiñor edifice geological units is consistent with the ne ridge arm of the island thus suggesting that el hierro was initially a single rift system this is consistent with the general growth model of volcanic islands fiske and jackson 1972 the geological model suggests that in the first stages of island growth the volcanic edifice did not grow along the three armed configuration becerril et al 2015 the collapse of the tiñor edifice seems to represent the opening of the eastern and southern ridge arm thus adopting the current 120 three armed configuration this would explain the greater extension of the largest volcanic shield developed during the el golfo cycle finally the temporal evolution of center of mass coordinate changes of the main geological sub units is shown in fig 7g this figure clearly shows the fluctuation in elevation and the horizontal coordinate changes over time in a logarithmic scale base 10 although increments change solidary between them elevation is clearly less affected one order of magnitude lower the cause of this fluctuation cannot be clearly identified and is only speculated upon with the stacking of the volcanic materials and maybe fluctuations of the hot spot relative position the lack of increments change solidary between the x coordinate and the rest of them which could be related to a southern displacement of the volcanic activity towards the southern ridge arm corroborated by the last eruption episode in la restinga jurado et al 2020 and offshore ridge mapping gee et al 2001 this southern migration of the volcanic activity has also been observed in la palma island close to el hierro island in space and time development carracedo et al 2001 the 3d geological model of el hierro island allowed investigation of spatial distribution of the sloping aprons of the top surfaces of the main sub units fig 8 a the slopes are clearly conditioned by the giant landslides where slopes present values between 16 and 35 on average and up to 39 37 and 23 in the lower tabular and ventejis sub units respectively of the tiñor edifice aside from the landslide scars each sub unit presents a different spatial distribution however the upper middle section el golfo edifice and ridge volcanism rifts edifice present a very similar pattern the pearson coefficient indicates a positive correlation fig 8b with a variation of slopes between these sub units in 34 of the evaluated slopes n 300 boxplot diagrams of the sloping aprons of the main sub units fig 8c indicate a cyclicity of the volcanic activity in the island the median slopes in the lower section of the cycles goes from 10 0 tiñor edifice down to 9 2 in the middle section and rises up again at the end of the cycle in the ventejis sub unit this cycle in the sloping aprons is reinitiated in the lower section el golfo edifice and apparently finishes with the ridge volcanism sub unit thus including the rifts edifice under this interpretation the volcanism of the el golfo sub unit would correspond to the start of a new cycle i e the first stages of a new edifice the lower slopes could be related to lava flows of a fluid nature with low angles of deposition the lower the viscosity the lower the slope the deposition of pyroclasts will tend to present higher slopes with respect to the local domain therefore analysis of the slopes could help to infer the disposition genesis 5 conclusions the presented 3d geological model of el hierro volcanic island defined a useful methodology to build fully digital 3d geological models of volcanic islands and is the first model of el hierro island in addition the proposed methodology provides a valuable geometrical insight of the volcano stratigraphic units these units can help to better understand volcanic activity cycles that in the end constrain its heterogeneity and subsequently groundwater flow and water resources availability the 3d geological model allowed the spatial description of the centers of mass of the main sub units of the tiñor edifice suggesting that el hierro was initially a single rift system the distribution of these centers of mass in the tiñor edifice contrasted with those of the el golfo and rifts edifice sub units which were found to concentrate at the coalescence of the three rift arms this suggests that the collapse of the tiñor edifice was followed by the opening of the eastern and southern ridge arm that configures the current 120 three armed morphology this opening of the three rift arms would explain the greater extension of the largest volcanic shield developed during the el golfo cycle moreover the spatio temporal analysis of the centers of mass showed a cyclic pattern of the main geological sub units where fluctuations in elevation and lateral displacements over time were found to coincide with the main volcanic cycles associated with volcanic edifice stacking finally the spatial and temporal distribution analysis of the sloping aprons of the top surfaces in each main sub unit were found to be clearly conditioned by giant landslides and volcanic activity cycles of the island respectively the 3d information provided by the 3d geological model provides new variables to study the relationships between rift zones and giant lateral collapses the 3d model is expected to serve as a basis for the first hydrogeological and geothermal model of el hierro island thus allowing reproduction of groundwater flow and heat transport processes at an insular scale this will improve the hydrogeological and geothermal knowledge of this volcanic island thus advancing renewable resource management which is of great importance in remote islands with scarce water resources and

11686,fully 3d and multidimensional geological models are key for energy mining and water resources assessment and management which has a great economic impact 3d geological models provide critical information regarding geometric properties of the geological bodies of interest such as ore deposits or reservoirs allowing inference of volumes and availability to be exploited however defining a useful methodology to create a fully digital 3d geological model of volcanic islands is still very challenging due to the intrinsic complexity observed in the structure of volcanic systems two dimensional geological maps associated vertical geological cross sectional diagrams and borehole and water mining tunnels galleries logs were examined on el hierro island a geological modelling procedure using the software geomodeller obtained the first 3d geological model of el hierro volcanic island as a basis for volcanic formation definitions and geometric analysis surface volume and center of mass estimations of the differentiated sub units allowed a better understanding of the spatial distribution and evolution of the volcanic cycles of el hierro island over time the 3d model provided geometry information correlatable with volcanic activity cycles and lava pyroclast deposition mechanisms that ultimately defines the geometry of the volcanic units this information provides new variables valuable for the investigation of the existing relationships between rift zones and giant lateral collapses in addition the obtained 3d geological model of a volcanic island will support the building of the first hydrogeological and geothermal model of el hierro island allowing advancement of sustainability of isolated systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords 3d geological model el hierro island canary islands rift zones giant landslides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the largest unfrozen freshwater reservoir on earth underpinning human development and important ecosystems eamus et al 2016 gleeson et al 2020 it supplies approximately two billion people with drinking water worldwide morris et al 2003 and satisfies 40 of the global irrigation demand siebert et al 2010 groundwater resources in arid and semi arid regions are suffering from depletion due to increasing demands and limited recharge rates scanlon et al 2006 in these regions where surface water resources are scarce or absent islanders are forced to rely up to 95 on groundwater resources to provide fresh water for human consumption agriculture and livestock duncan 2012 this combination of factors is what has made efficient management of freshwater resources and policy establishment a major challenge for the authorities of these islands tribble 2008 white and falkland 2010 furthermore heterogeneity and anisotropy in volcanic oceanic islands have been recognized as major factors conditioning resource assessment and planning custodio et al 2016 santamarta et al 2014 although most volcanic rock formations are considered poorly permeable productive aquifers can be found in quaternary volcanic rocks when an alternation of fissured lavas and porous pyroclasts are found margat and van der gun 2013 volcanic formations possess characteristic geometries compared with sedimentary deposits due to the endogenous processes which generate them solidification of magma lava and pyroclastic deposition these volcanic structures developed in volcanic zones are linked to lava composition and type of eruption thus conditioning groundwater flow regimes singhal and gupta 2010 significant volcanic structures that condition groundwater flow in volcanic islands include extensive layering produced by successive eruptions dykes extending several kilometres volcanic edifices submarine basalts and massive landslides custodio 2020 the central part of volcanic islands is characterized by a swarm of vertical dykes low permeability cutting across the lava flows and acting as barriers against groundwater flow towards the sea thereby forming water compartments at different heights lachassagne et al 2014 therefore the heterogeneity inherent to volcanic island geology is required to understand groundwater flow in such environments in particular these heterogeneities have been considered critical in hydrogeological studies of volcanic islands worldwide in the atlantic ocean including the macaronesia archipelagos such as azores garcía gil et al 2022 madeira prada et al 2005 canary islands garcía gil et al 2022 cape verde lopes et al 2022 and the lesser antilles hemmings et al 2015 in the pacific ocean such as the hawaiian islands lachassagne et al 2014 the galapagos islands violette et al 2014 and most of the islands of oceania hughes et al 2022 and in the indian ocean in islands such as comoros comte et al 2016 reunion join et al 2016 and mauritius povinec et al 2012 hydrogeological characterization of volcanic aquifers in oceanic islands requires sophisticated technical and methodological instruments including the use of remote sensors el rayes et al 2020 specific mathematical models herrera and custodio 2014 and geostatistical methods derived from pseudo regional hydraulic tests poncela et al 2022 historically hydrogeologists have coped with heterogeneity in natural porous media using spatially distributed numerical modelling anderson et al 2015 distributed models can be valuable tools because they have the ability to take the subsurface heterogeneity into account and provide distributed output variables dehotin and braud 2008 however spatially distributed models require 3d geological models to provide spatial discretization of the numerical model domain thus accounting for existing heterogeneities numerical models in hydrogeology have progressively incorporated 3d geological models for the evaluation of groundwater capacity and vulnerability to depict aquifers and their properties at local regional or national scales maccormack et al 2019 turner et al 2021 using 3d geological modelling as a basis for hydrogeological research in volcanic environments has been proven to provide a significant improvement of groundwater resource assessments as it allows reducing geometry and parametrization uncertainty of the aquifers gill et al 2011 although the geology of volcanoes has been extensively researched in previous works bonforte et al 2022 cas et al 2018 macdonald et al 1983 schmincke 2004 references on 3d geological model building are scarce and limited to the island of weh to our knowledge nugraha and o sullivan 2019 weh is a young volcanic island located in the northern part of the great sumatra fault system indonesia the authors developed a 3d geological model with the commercial software leapfrog to define a geothermal reservoir of the jaboi geothermal area the obtained geological model resulted to be a very useful 3d visualization tool and compiled all of the geological and geothermal exploration data obtained to date geological structures rock types water level and surface manifestations in this paper we present the first 3d geological model of el hierro volcanic island as a basis for hydrogeological and geothermal research the main objective of this work is to propose and apply a methodology to build a fully digital 3d geological model of the volcanic island consistent with a 20 year old set of paper geological maps by the geological survey of spain igme csic and other datasets described below the second objective of this work is to provide suitable metadata about the 3d geological model of el hierro island making it available to potential users and informing them about its specifications and its uncertainties the methodology presented to develop a 3d geological model of volcanic islands will support the building of the first hydrogeological and geothermal model of el hierro island this will allow reproduction of groundwater flow and transport processes of solutes and heat at an insular scale the simulations obtained from this model will improve the hydrogeological knowledge of this volcanic island and thus advance knowledge about aquifer vulnerability in volcanic islands in addition to creating strategies for adaptation to climate change reproducing heat transport in the subsurface will allow to investigate the shallow geothermal potential and its renewability due to groundwater advection of heat will be investigated 2 study area the canary islands archipelago is the emerged part of the canary volcanic province which is composed of seven main islands and several islets as well as the associated seamounts the archipelago is found in the eastern atlantic ocean region 28 n 16 w 100 km from the african coast fig 1 the island of el hierro is the youngest most western and southern island of the canary archipelago it has a total emerged area of 268 7 km2 and a maximum altitude of 1501 m a s l meters above mean sea level a total of 58 of its surface is environmentally protected and in 2000 the whole island became a unesco biosphere reserve in addition the entire island of el hierro was also classed as a unesco global geopark in 2014 a very characteristic morphological feature of oceanic volcanic islands is its shape a truncated triangular pyramid with three alignments corresponding to a classic 120 spaced volcanic rift system coalescing in its central sector where it reaches its maximum altitude island summit without a doubt the most outstanding geological relief on the island is the impressive el golfo valley officially recognized as one of the global geosites igme 2022 it originated almost instantly after the mobilization of some 180 km3 of the northern flank of the island both in its subaerial and submarine portion producing a 14 5 km wide depression limited by a semi circular escarpment which has a maximum height of 1100 m in its central sector the hydrogeology of el hierro and its groundwater supply systems have been extensively studied by santamarta 2017 and santamarta and rodríguez martín 2020 describing the geological structures involved in the movement and storage of water in the island aquifer comparing it with the hawaiian islands the oldest subaerial rocks of el hierro are dated at 1 12 myr guillou et al 1996 and the geology is representative of a volcanic oceanic island in its initial phase of shield development most of the island is covered by cinder cones and recent lava flows as surface expressions of emission vents fed by aligned dyke swarms the steep topographic hillsides are scarcely affected by erosive gullies the internal structure of the island is formed by overlapping volcanic edifices that successively developed and collapsed the collapses of the volcanic edifices are caused by giant landslides located between volcanic rift arms resulting in horseshoe shaped embayments troll and carracedo 2016 based on stratigraphic and radiometric data abdel monem et al 1972 guillou et al 1996 perez torrado et al 2011 three large superimposed volcanoes have been identified as result of subaerial activity in the island the tiñor the el golfo and the recent rift volcano fig 1 the tiñor volcano 1 12 0 88 myr is the first subaerial volcanic edifice and its outcrops are found in the northeast part of the island as well as the las playas inlet three main construction phases have been distinguished defining three lithological sub units fig 1 the lower section the tabular section and the ventejís volcanic group while the first two phases correspond to fluid lavas transitioning from steeply dipping to sub horizontal flows the third phase corresponds to the most explosive activity stage of the edifice presenting emission vents with well preserved wide craters troll and carracedo 2016 the lower and tabular sections are constituted by alkaline basaltic emissions intensely affected by phyllonian rocks and alternating with intercalated pyroclastic levels lapilli and volcanic slag the latter intercalations increase towards the end of the lithostratigraphic unit in the ventejís area where a complex stratovolcano is observed igme 1997a the tiñor edifice growth was rapid and uninterrupted this is characteristic of the first stages of any volcanic island development and it typically results in major flank instability due to accompaniament by magmatic and pore fluid pressurisation triggered by the dyke emplacement elsworth and voight 1995 the tiñor volcano cycle ended with a giant landslide where the western flank of the tiñor edifice collapsed currently the associated landslide scar is hidden by the subsequent emissions of the el golfo edifice and by the volcanism of the rifts fig 2 a cross section 1 and fig 2b cross section 2 the el golfo edifice 545 175 kyr arose approximately 350 kyr after the western flank of the tiñor edifice collapsed it developed entirely in the brunhes epoch nestled in the slide of the tiñor edifice forming an angular unconformity that overlaps the remains of the tiñor volcano thus extending the island to the west morphological differences and local unconformities in the el golfo volcanic edifice allow identification of three sub units fig 1 the lower section the upper middle section and the upper section the lower section is mainly composed of strombolian pyroclasts with subordinate presence of basaltic lava flows materials related to explosive eruptions with surtseyan cinder cones and tuff rings this section is cut by northeast east south east and west northwest trending dyke swarms which also configure the current volcanic vent systems the upper middle section of the el golfo edifice shows no clear discordance with the lower section indicating continuous emission the materials of the upper middle section also include basaltic lava flows but in this case with less dense dyke swarms and the presence of subordinated pyroclastic cones igme 1997a the upper section of the el golfo edifice consists of different block and ash deposits trachybasalts trachytes and differentiated lava flows which probably represents the last stages of the volcanic activity troll and carracedo 2016 during the final stages of the el golfo edifice construction a giant landslide occurred 176 kyr in the sw sector igme 1997c this is evidenced by a wide arc formed in the sw sector of the island the absence of the el golfo materials and the large pile of lavas released during the later ridge volcanism in the el julan area fig 2d cross section 4 furthermore the study carried out on the continental shelf by holcomb and searle 1991 shows the existence of avalanche deposits on the seafloor the third and last main volcano edifice of the island involves the recent rift volcanism 158 kyr which is made up of rift series lavas as the last volcanic stage in the island s growth it consists of strombolian cones located along the three arms of the rift resulting from simultaneous activity and lava emissions that cover the two previous volcano edifices the recent rift volcanism is the unit that occupies the largest area of the island it consists of basaltic lava flows that are mainly located over the el golfo edifice igme 1997b in the final eruptive phases of the rift volcanism during the upper pleistocene the ascending magma injection thrust into the upper part of the island produced a severe lithostatic breakdown this led to the destabilization and collapse of the el golfo edifice including the overlapping lava flows of the volcanism of the ridges generating a large horseshoe shaped embayment between the northern and western rift arms igme 1997c manconi et al 2009 this giant landslide profoundly altered the physiognomy of the island and is the most important morphological feature of el hierro fig 2c cross section 3 the collapse scar starts at an altitude of 1500 m a s l and ends up at 3200 m a s l and the mobilized materials are deposited 65 km off the coastline of the island covering 1500 km2 of seafloor masson et al 2002 troll and carracedo 2016 coetaneous to this event another landslide took place in the eastern part of the island affecting the las playas section gee et al 2001 masson et al 2002 the subsequent erosive action on the escarpment generated a large volume of detrital deposits at its base after the landslide at the el golfo area not the volcano different lava flows filled the formed depression whose emission centers were located on the steep slopes of the depression close to or within the structural axis where the greatest eruptive activity was concentrated at that time this volcanism was dominantly effusive with massive lava emissions that flowed towards the coastline filling the valley and reaching a thickness of 300 m in some places igme 1997c at the same time at the ends of the rift arms there were emissions of lava flows that overflowed the paleo cliffs of the tiñor and el golfo edifices giving rise to small coastal platforms called low islands these emissions have been assigned to sub recent and recent times and illustrate the continuous growth of the island around the structural axes igme 1997a igme 1997b recent sedimentary materials include colluvium deposits consisting of coarse detrital materials angular blocks cobbles and sands these materials are mostly associated with the las playas and el golfo escarpments located at the foot of these basaltic reliefs igme 1997c regarding the island s hydrogeology igme 1997c troll and carracedo 2016 the materials belonging to the tiñor edifice are made up of hard rocks of low permeability which have a low hydraulic conductivity and low storativity however these hard rocks are affected by a dense dyke swarm comprising fractured rocks that may show moderate to good secondary permeability depending on the fracturing degree and thus presenting high anisotropy the materials corresponding to el golfo volcano edifice present a high permeability due to their favourable low degree of alteration and compaction and they constitute the main aquifer of the island the materials associated with the activity in the rifts that correspond to the volcanism of the ridges the volcanism at el golfo area and the sub recent and recent emissions have not undergone alteration and will also tend to present high permeability 3 methodology 3 1 input data for the el hierro 3d geological model the datasets on geological information of el hierro island are mainly available as 2d maps and associated vertical geological cross sectional diagrams and borehole water mining tunnels galleries logs fig 3 most of this dataset proceeds from petrological geochronological abdel monem et al 1972 fúster et al 1993 and palaeomagnetic data guillou et al 1996 széréméta et al 1999 the data was obtained from geological sections showing the collapse scars and deep gullies the wells boreholes and water mining tunnel geological profiles in el golfo and the recent rift volcanoes concretely to build the presented 3d geological model of el hierro a total of five geological maps four 20 year old sets of paper geological maps at 1 25 000 scale from the spanish geological survey igme 1997a igme 1997b igme 1997c igme 1997d and one from troll and carracedo 2016 were considered the documentation associated with these maps included seven and five cross sections respectively which were also used for building the 3d model figs 2g and 3 in addition lithological profile descriptions of 15 773 m from 37 waterworks and boreholes were used as input in the 3d model fig 3 those included two high diameter 5 m canary wells 213 m total perforation 14 boreholes 2047 m 10 galleries 8139 m and 11 well galleries 5 374 m in the canary islands it is typical to find high diameter wells that go deep vertically or with a given angle until the perforation reaches the groundwater level and then the drilling turns horizontal or dips to low angles 5 all the direction changes and inclinations of the galleries and well galleries are available and described in the 3d geological model fig 3c the fourth primary source used to create the 3d geological model was the digital terrain model dtm the dtms obtained from the spain national geographic institute ign were created from the lidar point cloud with a density of 0 5 points per square meter with a root mean square error rmse in the z axis under 0 20 m 1 sigma cnig 2020 they consisted in a raster dataset with a horizontal cell resolution of 25 m and represented the land surface without any vegetation or buildings 3 2 el hierro 3d geological model workflow the workflow for building the 3d geological model of el hierro was initiated once all available input data existing and new data were collected and processed fig 3 by data compilation in the geomodeller software platform gibson et al 2013 this software makes use of the implicit geological modelling approach for the modelling of complex geological structures the code uses geological observations and or cartographic data to generate 3 d geological surfaces and volumes specifically it incorporates an algorithm calcagno et al 2008 lajaunie et al 1997 which applies cokriging to geological interfaces and orientation data obtained from structural fields to interpolate a continuous 3d potential field scalar function describing both the geology and geometry the software uses its own concept of geological pile to allow the aggregation of these boundaries and maintain stratigraphic relationships and fault network chronology the definition of a geological pile involves a given topology of the interfaces to characterize their spatial architecture without considering their chronological order after defining the fault geometry with specific potential fields the software calculates fault displacements from universal kriging calculations of the discontinuities finally the defined geological pile establishes spatial relationships between each individual model of each series to complete the 3 d model the geologic modelling procedure inside the geomodeller environment is synthetized in the following steps first a resolution of 10 m was adopted for the model and its domain was set by a bounding box of 29 25 6 km containing the whole island down to 3000 m b m s l meters below mean sea level then the dtm was prepared and imported into geomodeller to characterize the upper surface of the geological model after that the geological pile was defined to accomplish its modelling considering that the objective of the 3d geological model is to address groundwater management and geothermal potential estimations this project targeted the mapping of different hydrostratigraphic units to discretize rock porosity and permeability distributions the sequence of lithological formations to be created included the volcanic materials that allowed description and interpretation of the main three volcanos this geological pile allowed inclusion of mapping units and relevant known structures in a generalized geological model the different formation classification schemes used in each separate geological map sheet covered all the island and its harmonization to obtain at a single sequence the result of this harmonization is the units and sub units shown in fig 1 the geological pile definition was followed by preparation of surface geological data the maps were obtained in digital format fig 4 a the geological maps were georeferenced and then imported into geomodeller to manually digitalize the formation interfaces of the geological pile intersecting the topography orientation data and faults the vertical pre existing cross sections found in the literature and described above were edited to distinguish subsurface interfaces and orientations of the units defined in the geological pile of geomodeller fig 2 the adapted vertical cross section diagrams were cut and the start and end locations for the cross section were georeferenced before being imported into geomodeller fig 4b the cross sections provided interpretations of the three main volcano edifices including the pronounced faulting related to giant landslides once imported the correspondence between each topographic surface profile calculated by geomodeller and the topography represented on the georeferenced cross section was verified the 12 cross sections extracted from the literature fig 2g and adapted for the 3d model were distributed throughout the domain the next step was 3d projection of all borehole well and gallery geological profiles logs fig 4c these projections identifying the defined geological pile units were correlated by making use of 59 additional auxiliary cross sections fig 2g that ensured a fully 3d model interpolation robustness the final task before computing the 3d model consisted of checking through exhaustive 3d visualization the consistency between all surface and subsurface interface and orientation points borehole and gallery projections to be 3d interpolated 3 3 geometric analysis of el hierro main 3d geological units the obtained 3d geological model results for every sub unit were exported in the form of a 40 40 m horizontal x y grid data framework to understand the distribution of mass in the geological units the exported data set were used to calculate the center of mass of each subunit according to 1 r x r y r z r 1 m i 1 n m i r x i y i z i were r is the position vector of the center of mass with coordinates x r y r z r r is the position vector of the i th particle in the geological sub units of n particles m i is the mass of the i th particle and m is the total mass of the particles which was assumed constant since a density distribution map of the subunits was not available although giant landslides have affected the main volcano edifices of the island the centers of mass were calculated to evaluate possible similitudes and differences between geological bodies and discuss possible emission points of the volcanic materials in addition to centers of masses the slope distribution for each top shell of the different geological subunits was calculated this was calculated in the arcmap 10 esri 2011 environment the coordinate of the top shell points of each subunit was converted into rasters to run the slope tool spatial analyst v which allowed identification of the steepness at each cell of a raster surface calculated using the average maximum technique burrough et al 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 3d geological model and historical evolution of el hierro volcanic island a resume of the main geometrical parameters of the obtained 3d reconstruction of el hierro island is shown in table 1 the most spread materials are those related to the ridge volcanism with an extension of 182 5 km2 67 8 of the island surface followed by el golfo lower and middle sub units with 152 5 and 141 7 km2 respectively 56 7 and 52 7 respectively the tiñor edifice s sub units presented three to two times smaller than the ridge volcanism in terms of volume the middle and lower sub units of the el golfo edifice presented the largest values of 69 3 and 51 8 km3 representing 52 0 of the emerged island volume the following 29 8 of the emerged volume is mainly constituted by rifts materials associated with ridge volcanism 40 1 km3 and volcanism of el golfo 29 3 km3 sub units an additional 16 7 of the emerged volume is constituted by the tiñor edifice sub units in total the accumulated volume in all these described sub units accounts for 98 5 of the merged volume of the island the surface volume ratio showed a clear cyclicity along the material stacking at the main volcano edifices of tiñor and el golfo in the first stages the ratio was relatively large 0 23 0 53 and this drastically decreased to 0 05 0 09 in the last stages of volcanic activity of the main edifices in the last rifts cycle stages where mapped lava flow materials are shallow and local similar ratios below 0 10 were observed the obtained fully 3d geological model is shown in fig 5 a as 3d projected with opaque surfaces in geological sub units and transparent for the water body fig 5b presents the 3d wireframe view and fig 5c as a fence diagram with some cross sections intersecting the most important borehole and water gallery geological profiles the geometry of the geological sub units inside the island can be described according to the geological history of the island fig 6 the first main volcano edifice tiñor after its collapse and before las playas landslide is shown in fig 6a the paleorelief of the tiñor edifice was actuated as an underpin surface for the subsequent el golfo lava flows of the lower and middle sections the el golfo edifice is believed to have developed a 20 km diameter volcanic shield custodio 2020 before its multiple collapses through three major landslides el golfo el julan and las playas landslides the geological model allowed to fully 3d reconstruct its geometries fig 6b thanks to the 3d geological model and according to table 1 after its collapse the el golfo edifice still represented 52 6 of the emerged island volume which is 3 1 times the tiñor edifice fig 6c shows the ridge volcanism sub unit which was also affected by the later landslides this figure also shows how the stacking of these sub units configures the final scar of the giant landslide that destroyed the largest volcanic shield of the island to date and the circumstances previous to the volcanism of el golfo was emplaced in the decompressed area fig 6d finally fig 6e shows the recent and sub recent lava flow emissions together with minor sedimentary deposits 4 2 unravelling volcanism cycles from the 3d geological model of the el hierro island the calculated center of mass of each geological sub unit identified in the 3d geological model is shown in table 1 the elevation z coordinate of the center of mass of the sub units clearly shows the staking evolution within the major volcanic cycles with a positive increase of 99 412 m after the major collapse of each edifice the total accumulated increase of each edifice was 387 694 and 509 m for the tiñor el golfo and rifts edifices respectively the spatial descriptions of center of mass of the main sub units are shown in fig 7 the spatial changes of the center of mass of the tiñor edifice sub units show a clear linear 5 km drift ne with a 39 eastward deviation from the north fig 7a in addition vertical profiles in fig 7b and c show how the mass center of mass of the lower and tabular sub units presents similar horizontal coordinates while the center of mass of the ventejís sub unit increases those coordinates the rest of the centers of mass of the main geological sub units of the el golfo and rifts edifices are concentrated towards the west close to the three rift arms coalescence where the major elevations of the island are found differences among the centers of mass of these sub units fig 7d can be explained by the main el golfo landslide scar concave morphology which similarly affected the ridge volcanism and upper middle sub units vertical fault plane but not the lower section low angle fault plane fig 7e shows a linear dependency of the center of mass with respect to the x coordinate including the ridge volcanism sub unit although this sub unit is considered to be part of another volcanic cycle rifts edifice its geometry suggests a close relationship with the el golfo cycle the alignment of the centers of mass of the tiñor edifice geological units is consistent with the ne ridge arm of the island thus suggesting that el hierro was initially a single rift system this is consistent with the general growth model of volcanic islands fiske and jackson 1972 the geological model suggests that in the first stages of island growth the volcanic edifice did not grow along the three armed configuration becerril et al 2015 the collapse of the tiñor edifice seems to represent the opening of the eastern and southern ridge arm thus adopting the current 120 three armed configuration this would explain the greater extension of the largest volcanic shield developed during the el golfo cycle finally the temporal evolution of center of mass coordinate changes of the main geological sub units is shown in fig 7g this figure clearly shows the fluctuation in elevation and the horizontal coordinate changes over time in a logarithmic scale base 10 although increments change solidary between them elevation is clearly less affected one order of magnitude lower the cause of this fluctuation cannot be clearly identified and is only speculated upon with the stacking of the volcanic materials and maybe fluctuations of the hot spot relative position the lack of increments change solidary between the x coordinate and the rest of them which could be related to a southern displacement of the volcanic activity towards the southern ridge arm corroborated by the last eruption episode in la restinga jurado et al 2020 and offshore ridge mapping gee et al 2001 this southern migration of the volcanic activity has also been observed in la palma island close to el hierro island in space and time development carracedo et al 2001 the 3d geological model of el hierro island allowed investigation of spatial distribution of the sloping aprons of the top surfaces of the main sub units fig 8 a the slopes are clearly conditioned by the giant landslides where slopes present values between 16 and 35 on average and up to 39 37 and 23 in the lower tabular and ventejis sub units respectively of the tiñor edifice aside from the landslide scars each sub unit presents a different spatial distribution however the upper middle section el golfo edifice and ridge volcanism rifts edifice present a very similar pattern the pearson coefficient indicates a positive correlation fig 8b with a variation of slopes between these sub units in 34 of the evaluated slopes n 300 boxplot diagrams of the sloping aprons of the main sub units fig 8c indicate a cyclicity of the volcanic activity in the island the median slopes in the lower section of the cycles goes from 10 0 tiñor edifice down to 9 2 in the middle section and rises up again at the end of the cycle in the ventejis sub unit this cycle in the sloping aprons is reinitiated in the lower section el golfo edifice and apparently finishes with the ridge volcanism sub unit thus including the rifts edifice under this interpretation the volcanism of the el golfo sub unit would correspond to the start of a new cycle i e the first stages of a new edifice the lower slopes could be related to lava flows of a fluid nature with low angles of deposition the lower the viscosity the lower the slope the deposition of pyroclasts will tend to present higher slopes with respect to the local domain therefore analysis of the slopes could help to infer the disposition genesis 5 conclusions the presented 3d geological model of el hierro volcanic island defined a useful methodology to build fully digital 3d geological models of volcanic islands and is the first model of el hierro island in addition the proposed methodology provides a valuable geometrical insight of the volcano stratigraphic units these units can help to better understand volcanic activity cycles that in the end constrain its heterogeneity and subsequently groundwater flow and water resources availability the 3d geological model allowed the spatial description of the centers of mass of the main sub units of the tiñor edifice suggesting that el hierro was initially a single rift system the distribution of these centers of mass in the tiñor edifice contrasted with those of the el golfo and rifts edifice sub units which were found to concentrate at the coalescence of the three rift arms this suggests that the collapse of the tiñor edifice was followed by the opening of the eastern and southern ridge arm that configures the current 120 three armed morphology this opening of the three rift arms would explain the greater extension of the largest volcanic shield developed during the el golfo cycle moreover the spatio temporal analysis of the centers of mass showed a cyclic pattern of the main geological sub units where fluctuations in elevation and lateral displacements over time were found to coincide with the main volcanic cycles associated with volcanic edifice stacking finally the spatial and temporal distribution analysis of the sloping aprons of the top surfaces in each main sub unit were found to be clearly conditioned by giant landslides and volcanic activity cycles of the island respectively the 3d information provided by the 3d geological model provides new variables to study the relationships between rift zones and giant lateral collapses the 3d model is expected to serve as a basis for the first hydrogeological and geothermal model of el hierro island thus allowing reproduction of groundwater flow and heat transport processes at an insular scale this will improve the hydrogeological and geothermal knowledge of this volcanic island thus advancing renewable resource management which is of great importance in remote islands with scarce water resources and

11687,the ongoing covid 19 contagious disease caused by sars cov 2 has disrupted global public health businesses and economies due to widespread infection with 676 41 million confirmed cases and 6 77 million deaths in 231 countries as of february 07 2023 to control the rapid spread of sars cov 2 it is crucial to determine the potential determinants such as meteorological factors and their roles this study examines how covid 19 cases and deaths changed over time while assessing meteorological characteristics that could impact these disparities from the onset of the pandemic we used data spanning two years across all eight administrative divisions this is the first of its kind showing a connection between meteorological conditions vaccination and covid 19 incidences in bangladesh we further employed several techniques including simple exponential smoothing ses auto regressive integrated moving average arima auto regressive integrated moving average with explanatory variables

administrative divisions of bangladesh spanning march 8 2020 to january 31 2023 from available online servers the meteorological data include rainfall mm relative humidity average temperature c surface pressure kpa dew point c and maximum wind speed m s the observed wind speed and surface pressure show a significant negative impact on covid 19 cases 0 89 95 confidence interval ci 1 62 to 0 21 and 1 31 95 ci 2 32 to 0 29 respectively similarly the observed wind speed and surface pressure show a significant negative impact on covid 19 deaths 0 87 95 ci 1 54 to 0 21 and 3 11 95 ci 4 44 to 1 25 respectively the impact of meteorological factors is almost similar when vaccination information is included in the model however the impact of vaccination in both cases and deaths model is significantly negative for cases 1 19 95 ci 2 35 to 0 38 and for deaths 1 55 95 ci 2 88 to 0 43 accordingly vaccination effectively reduces the number of new covid 19 cases and fatalities in

area bangladesh is a south asian developing country situated at 20 34 north latitude and 92 41 east longitude fig 1 it is a densely populated country bounded by the bay of bengal in the south region the observed average temperature in bangladesh was around 26 c with a range between 15 c and 34 c throughout the year and a yearly average rainfall equal to 2200 mm mm the relative humidity is observed higher from june to october in bangladesh supplementary figure sf1 map a shows that higher temperature exists along central to southern parts of bangladesh while lower temperature was found along northern parts adjoining the north borderline of bangladesh and south eastern parts bordering myanmar the highest and lowest temperature observed in bhola 26 1995 c and lalmonirhat 21 3966 c districts respectively possible causes can be that bhola is located adjoining the bay of bengal whereas lalmonirhat is located in the northern part near the foothills of the himalayan hill ranges rimi et al 2019 rainfall in map b depicts an inverse scenario with respect to temperature due to lower rainfall along central and most of the southern parts the air temperature observed relatively higher on the contrary higher rainfall in northern bangladesh and the majority parts of the chittagong hill tracts lead to relatively lower air temperature rainfall in cox s bazar 410 0638 mm and narail 138 9112 mm districts noticed higher and lower respectively monsoon weather from the south western of the bay of bengal causes higher rainfall in cox s bazar district rahman et al 2015 map c shows higher wind speeds found across central south western and north western bangladesh lower speed found across the northeastern and south eastern parts the highest wind speed identified in the narail district 9 044 m s thus due to the highest wind movement narail showed the lowest rainfall sylhet district showed the lowest wind speed 4 7948 m s as the greater sylhet division has tripura hills on its south part these hills work as a barrier to higher wind speed map d shows higher relative humidity along the central southern central and north eastern parts of bangladesh whereas lower humidity is noticed

pressure at 0 51 table 2 we found a trend between observed and predicted covid 19 cases using the ses model with r2 rmse and mae values of 95 49 622 17 and 268 32 respectively table 3 and fig 3 we identified the trend between observed and predicted covid 19 deaths using arimax and arimax vaccination models with r2 rmse and mae values of 96 71 and 96 66 531 42 and 639 51 and 245 49 and 329 18 respectively we also observed a substantial growing trend between observed and predicted covid 19 deaths in the arima and prophet models with r2 rmse and mae values of 96 69 and 38 86 532 94 and 2290 63 and 240 23 and 1588 01 respectively table 3 the arimax model with vaccination variable shows all other models in terms of accuracy with better r2 rmse and mae values the model showed a higher coefficient of determination and smaller errors than the arima arimax prophet and benchmark ses models the covid 19 deaths are predicted to rise significantly in the next 15 days according to both forecasted models the forecasting of the regional daily deaths of covid 19 for each model is shown in fig 3 we also found a consistent trend between observed and predicted covid 19 confirmed deaths in the ses model with r2 rmse and mae values of 97 55 7 35 and 4 47 respectively table 3 and fig 4 we also noticed a substantial growing trend between observed and predicted covid 19 cases using the arimax and arimax vaccination models with r2 rmse and mae values of 97 67 and 97 65 7 16 and 7 29 and 4 36 and 4 45 respectively moreover we detected a substantial growing trend between observed and predicted covid 19 cases and deaths in the arima and prophet models with r2 rmse and mae values of 97 66 and 70 45 7 18 and 25 17 and 4 32 and 18 46 respectively table 3 the arimax model with vaccination variable outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy with better r2 rmse and mae values the model showed a higher coefficient of determination and smaller errors than the arima arimax prophet and benchmark ses models the covid 19 cases are predicted to rise significantly in the next 15 days according to both forecasted models the forecasting of the regional daily cases of covid 19 for each model is shown in fig 4 table 4 shows that the average wind speed and surface pressure have a significantly negative relation withcovid 19 daily confirmed cases 0 89 95 ci 1 62 to 0 21 and 1 31 95 ci 2 32 to 0 29 respectively a 100 dose improvement in vaccination coverage is associated with 1 19 95 ci 2 35 0 38 times reduction in covid 19 incidence table 5 shows that the wind speed 0 87 95 ci 1 54 to 0 21 and surface pressure 1 51 95 ci 2 88 0 01 have a significantly negative relation withcovid 19 daily confirmed deaths these findings are similar when we include the effect of vaccination in the model with meteorological variables 4 discussion this study investigated the correlation between meteorological parameters and pandemic outcomes in bangladesh by considering many potential predictors our findings showed a substantial linkage between climatic factors and daily covid 19 confirmed cases and deaths the outcomes of the arimax model and trend study imply that daily covid 19 positive cases and deaths are linked to wind speed and surface pressure rainfall shows a positive correlation with both confirmed cases and deaths of covid 19 several research conducted to ascertain whether meteorological variables correlate with the expansion of sars cov 2 confirm the existence of the relationship kumar et al 2022 sarkodie and owusu 2021a vadiati et al 2022 research on the relationship between meteorological characteristics and infectious diseases including avian influenza a h5n1 sars cov and mers cov reported the significance of metrological factors on the transmission of previous epidemics pandemics sarkodie and owusu 2021b for example sarkodie and owusu 2021b found a negative correlation between metrological parameters e g wind speed solar radiation and humidity on the covid 19 pandemic in iran sarkodie and owusu 2021b shi et al 2020 reported meteorological parameters are correlated with the transmission of sars cov 2 infection in china few studies in different countries also supported the related results such as in malaysia suhaimi et al 2020 germany sarkodie and owusu 2021b norway menebo 2020 and indonesia sarkodie and owusu 2021b our findings showed that temperature is linked with covid 19 mortality which is consistent with previous research studies and confirmed the conclusion of other investigations christophiet al 2021 found the chance of increasing daily numbers of sars cov 2003 pandemic was 18 times higher on days with a lower environmental temperature than on days with a higher temperature temperature greater than 24 6 c used as the reference standard christophi et al 2021 sars cov in different climatic conditions and reported high temperature and rh showed a synergistic role in sars cov virus inactivation whereas low temperature and rh increased viral lifetime sabarathinam et al 2022 as a result the environmental parameters of tropical countries e g chile malaysia egypt and thailand were found not suitable for the long term existence of the virus based on the sars cov 2 data from 166 country sites it can be concluded that temperature adversely correlated with daily cases and fatalities of covid 19 y f wu et al 2020 the incidence of covid 19 in china reduces as the temperature rises f y wu et al 2020 in another study shi et al 2020 reported an increase in temperature and rh are connected with a decrease in covid 19 transmission in 100 chinese cities however lots of findings showed higher temperature humidity and uv radiation did not affect covid 19 incidence luo et al 2020 yao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 jinjarak et al 2020 analyzed the covid 19 death rates associated with meteorological variables in these current findings we found a negative relation between rainfall and covid 19 daily cases and deaths however several studies found a positive connection between rainfall and the transmission of influenza gomez barroso et al 2017 mahamat a dussart p bouix a carvalho l eltges f matheus s miller m a quenel p 2013 the data suggested that the influenza virus or short range transmission was prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions droplets or aerosols formed during coughing snoring speaking singing or breathing can transfer viruses into the air bi et al 2007 aerosol virus survival and infectivity are affected by ambient stress temperature jayaweera et al 2020 hence sars cov 2can be active for 3 h in spray form 5 μm but shows higher viability on plastic surfaces and stainless metals copper body cartons and glassware for up to 72 h in droplets 5 μm van doremalen et al 2020 the results indicated the viability of sars cov 2 reduced substantially due to the evaporation of the droplets at high temperatures similar to our findings another study reported rainfall has a negative association with the spread of covid 19 in india and pakistan m s m s hossain et al 2021 the precipitation rate responsible for the aggregation and washout process of aerosols in the environment and sars cov 2 rna correlated with the longevity of the virus in the atmosphere hence inactive to disperse further another mechanism might be that people often stay in residence on drizzling days and this could decrease the proliferation of covid 19 however due to covid 19 variants of the coronavirus are ongoing not a clear association between vaccination exposure with an increase or decrease in the number of cases therefore it is still necessary to study and follow up on this issue to learn how meteorological factors and vaccination is related to reducing the spread of covid 19 the growing of covid 19 incidence and fatality in bangladesh could be attributable to various factors including the enhanced number of asymptomatic patients silent spreader of covid 19 confirmed by lab testing the introduction of dexamethasone and additional medical treatment improvements for serious patients the experience of public health related occupations improved public consciousness and protection against covid 19 infections to control the spread of covid 19 vaccination plays a significant role particularly in declining new cases and death rates mortuza et al 2019 rimi et al 2019 our findings support that an increase in covid 19 vaccination reduces daily cases and deaths covid 19 vaccines are negatively correlated with the number of icu patients another public health study found every 10 upgrade of vaccines is related to8 reduction in mortality rates suthar et al 2022 5 limitations of the study the publicly available data may contain underreported statistics ofcovid 19 positive patients and deaths which may affect our investigations the original scenario of meteorological effects and vaccination may differ due to variability in air pollution human immunity individual migrations and mobility behavior and habits economic and lifestyle and cultural conditions which may affect covid 19 mortality and incidence by acting as confounders in addition our study was based on metrological outdoor data however sars cov 2 transmission can be affected quite differently by indoor air conditions these criteria should be included while evaluating the combined meteorological indicators and covid 19 in future studies 6 recommendation the manufacturers of vaccines could take precautions to avoid meteorological influences while maintaining or improving the effectiveness lin et al 2020 studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccinations when given in sequential doses by different manufacturers using the same technology should be conducted by researchers working with meteorological data additionally tests involving the mixing or subsequent administration of vaccinations in various meteorological variations ought to be conducted to see if they may provide a wide range of cross protection against recently developing varieties haga et al 2022 to quickly resolve this issue enough financing rigorous research and extensive assessments are needed the conflicting results on the impact of weather on the covid 19 outbreak however highlight the need for additional study on multiple vaccination application settings and longer time series datasets additional studies could be undertaken to examine the association between meteorological variables and covid 19 verified cases as well as the daily testing rate and other social and environmental factors as control parameters datasets for human serum antibody levels and sars cov 2 vaccination are still lacking therefore additional research could be done to explore the factors affecting vaccination donzelli et al 2022 7 conclusion this research is the first to analyze the linkage between meteorological factors and covid 19 daily cases and deaths in bangladesh using two years of data across all eight administrative divisions covid 19 positive reports and deaths are substantially correlatedwith climatic parameters such as rainfall relative humidity temperature wind speed surface pressure and dew point either positively or negatively further investigations are required to understand the covid 19 daily patterns and pathogenicity of the virus at the host level the analysis of our results demonstrates that covid 19 vaccination successfully reduces the daily cases and deaths in bangladesh our findings are useful to better understand monitor and control the transmission of sars cov 2

11687,the ongoing covid 19 contagious disease caused by sars cov 2 has disrupted global public health businesses and economies due to widespread infection with 676 41 million confirmed cases and 6 77 million deaths in 231 countries as of february 07 2023 to control the rapid spread of sars cov 2 it is crucial to determine the potential determinants such as meteorological factors and their roles this study examines how covid 19 cases and deaths changed over time while assessing meteorological characteristics that could impact these disparities from the onset of the pandemic we used data spanning two years across all eight administrative divisions this is the first of its kind showing a connection between meteorological conditions vaccination and covid 19 incidences in bangladesh we further employed several techniques including simple exponential smoothing ses auto regressive integrated moving average arima auto regressive integrated moving average with explanatory variables arimax and automatic forecasting time series model prophet we further analyzed the effects of covid 19 vaccination on daily cases and deaths data on covid 19 cases collected include eight administrative divisions of bangladesh spanning march 8 2020 to january 31 2023 from available online servers the meteorological data include rainfall mm relative humidity average temperature c surface pressure kpa dew point c and maximum wind speed m s the observed wind speed and surface pressure show a significant negative impact on covid 19 cases 0 89 95 confidence interval ci 1 62 to 0 21 and 1 31 95 ci 2 32 to 0 29 respectively similarly the observed wind speed and surface pressure show a significant negative impact on covid 19 deaths 0 87 95 ci 1 54 to 0 21 and 3 11 95 ci 4 44 to 1 25 respectively the impact of meteorological factors is almost similar when vaccination information is included in the model however the impact of vaccination in both cases and deaths model is significantly negative for cases 1 19 95 ci 2 35 to 0 38 and for deaths 1 55 95 ci 2 88 to 0 43 accordingly vaccination effectively reduces the number of new covid 19 cases and fatalities in bangladesh thus these results could assist future researchers and policymakers in the assessment of pandemics by making thorough efforts that account for covid 19 vaccinations and meteorological

meteorological conditions with vaccination data on covid 19 incidence in bangladesh prata et al 2020 in this study we examine the changes in covid 19 cases and deaths over time in bangladesh using time series models while documenting the characteristics of meteorological factors and vaccination campaigns that could impact these changes from the beginning of the pandemic 2 methodology 2 1 study area bangladesh is a south asian developing country situated at 20 34 north latitude and 92 41 east longitude fig 1 it is a densely populated country bounded by the bay of bengal in the south region the observed average temperature in bangladesh was around 26 c with a range between 15 c and 34 c throughout the year and a yearly average rainfall equal to 2200 mm mm the relative humidity is observed higher from june to october in bangladesh supplementary figure sf1 map a shows that higher temperature exists along central to southern parts of bangladesh while lower temperature was found along northern parts adjoining the north borderline of bangladesh and south eastern parts bordering myanmar the highest and lowest temperature observed in bhola 26 1995 c and lalmonirhat 21 3966 c districts respectively possible causes can be that bhola is located adjoining the bay of bengal whereas lalmonirhat is located in the northern part near the foothills of the himalayan hill ranges rimi et al 2019 rainfall in map b depicts an inverse scenario with respect to temperature due to lower rainfall along central and most of the southern parts the air temperature observed relatively higher on the contrary higher rainfall in northern bangladesh and the majority parts of the chittagong hill tracts lead to relatively lower air temperature rainfall in cox s bazar 410 0638 mm and narail 138 9112 mm districts noticed higher and lower respectively monsoon weather from the south western of the bay of bengal causes higher rainfall in cox s bazar district rahman et al 2015 map c shows higher wind speeds found across central south western and north western bangladesh lower speed found across the northeastern and south eastern parts the highest wind speed identified in the narail district 9 044 m s thus due to the highest wind movement narail showed the lowest rainfall sylhet district showed the lowest wind speed 4 7948 m s as the greater sylhet division has tripura hills on its south part these hills work as a barrier to higher wind speed map d shows higher relative humidity along the central southern central and north eastern parts of bangladesh whereas lower humidity is noticed majorly in north western and south eastern parts mortuza et al 2019 the highest and lowest relative humidity are found in lakshmipur 81 8055 and rajshahi 77 7943 districts respectively 2 2 daily covid

series models ses arima arimax and prophet to analyze the trend of covid 19 cases and deaths the time series models were selected based on the variables using the time series models with the reported covid 19 data we predicted the covid 19 new cases for the next 30 days we also used the ses model as a standard to compare the accuracy of other models previously these models were used among confirmed covid 19 affected patients in over 192 countries chyon et al 2022 2 4 1 ses model simple exponential smoothing the simple exponential smoothing model most commonly used model for analyzing time series data de livera et al 2011 ses is a simple tool that uses data as fluctuating around a steady mean tseng and shih 2020 the r package fpp2 is used for running the ses model in this study chaurasia and pal 2020 2 4 2 arima model auto regressive integrated moving average we used the arima which is a statistical data oriented analysis that uses the structure of the data itself to forecast the trend of daily covid 19 cases and deaths adhikari and agrawal 2013 for running the arima model the r package forecast is used in this study de livera et al 2011 the equation of this model

the long term existence of the virus based on the sars cov 2 data from 166 country sites it can be concluded that temperature adversely correlated with daily cases and fatalities of covid 19 y f wu et al 2020 the incidence of covid 19 in china reduces as the temperature rises f y wu et al 2020 in another study shi et al 2020 reported an increase in temperature and rh are connected with a decrease in covid 19 transmission in 100 chinese cities however lots of findings showed higher temperature humidity and uv radiation did not affect covid 19 incidence luo et al 2020 yao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 jinjarak et al 2020 analyzed the covid 19 death rates associated with meteorological variables in these current findings we found a negative relation between rainfall and covid 19 daily cases and deaths however several studies found a positive connection between rainfall and the transmission of influenza gomez barroso et al 2017 mahamat a dussart p bouix a carvalho l eltges f matheus s miller m a quenel p 2013 the data suggested that the influenza virus or short range transmission was prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions droplets or aerosols formed during coughing snoring speaking singing or breathing can transfer viruses into the air bi et al 2007 aerosol virus survival and infectivity are affected by ambient stress temperature jayaweera et al 2020 hence sars cov 2can be active for 3 h in spray form 5 μm but shows higher viability on plastic surfaces and stainless metals copper body cartons and glassware for up to 72 h in droplets 5 μm van doremalen et al 2020 the results indicated the viability of sars cov 2 reduced substantially due to the evaporation of the droplets at high temperatures similar to our findings another study reported rainfall has a negative association with the spread of covid 19 in india and pakistan m s m s hossain et al 2021 the precipitation rate responsible for the aggregation and washout process of aerosols in the environment and sars cov 2 rna correlated with the longevity of the virus in the atmosphere hence inactive to disperse further another mechanism might be that people often stay in residence on drizzling days and this could decrease the proliferation of covid 19 however due to covid 19 variants of the coronavirus are ongoing not a clear association between vaccination exposure with an increase or decrease in the number of cases therefore it is still necessary to study and follow up on this issue to learn how meteorological factors and vaccination is related to reducing the spread of covid 19 the growing of covid 19 incidence and fatality in bangladesh could be attributable to various factors including the enhanced number of asymptomatic patients silent spreader of covid 19 confirmed by lab testing the introduction of dexamethasone and additional medical treatment improvements for serious patients the experience of public health related occupations improved public consciousness and protection against covid 19 infections to control the spread of covid 19 vaccination plays a significant role particularly in declining new cases and death rates mortuza et al 2019 rimi et al 2019 our findings support that an increase in covid 19 vaccination reduces daily cases and deaths covid 19 vaccines are negatively correlated with the number of icu patients another public health study found every 10 upgrade of vaccines is related to8 reduction in mortality rates suthar et al 2022 5 limitations of the study the publicly available data may contain underreported statistics ofcovid 19 positive patients and deaths which may affect our investigations the original scenario of meteorological effects and vaccination may differ due to variability in air pollution human immunity individual migrations and mobility behavior and habits economic and lifestyle and cultural conditions which may affect covid 19 mortality and incidence by acting as confounders in addition our study was based on metrological outdoor data however sars cov 2 transmission can be affected quite differently by indoor air conditions these criteria should be included while evaluating the combined meteorological indicators and covid 19 in future studies 6 recommendation the manufacturers of vaccines could take precautions to avoid meteorological influences while maintaining or improving the effectiveness lin et al 2020 studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccinations when given in sequential doses by different manufacturers using the same technology should be conducted by researchers working with meteorological data additionally tests involving the mixing or subsequent administration of vaccinations in various meteorological variations ought to be conducted to see if they may provide a wide range of cross protection against recently developing varieties haga et al 2022 to quickly resolve this issue enough financing rigorous research and extensive assessments are needed the conflicting results on the impact of weather on the covid 19 outbreak however highlight the need for additional study on multiple vaccination application settings and longer time series datasets additional studies could be undertaken to examine the association between meteorological variables and covid 19 verified cases as well as the daily testing rate and other social and environmental factors as control parameters datasets for human serum antibody levels and sars cov 2 vaccination are still lacking therefore additional research could be done to explore the factors affecting vaccination donzelli et al 2022 7 conclusion this research is the first to analyze the linkage between meteorological factors and covid 19 daily cases and deaths in bangladesh using two years of data across all eight administrative divisions covid 19 positive reports and deaths are substantially correlatedwith climatic parameters such as rainfall relative humidity temperature wind speed surface pressure and dew point either positively or negatively further investigations are required to understand the covid 19 daily patterns and pathogenicity of the virus at the host level the analysis of our results demonstrates that covid 19 vaccination successfully reduces the daily cases and deaths in bangladesh our findings are useful to better understand monitor and control the transmission of sars cov 2

11688,middle ganga basin mgb is lifeline for millions of inhabitants relying heavily on the groundwater this has resulted in depletion of water quality and quantity at a very rapid scale the present study has emphasized on hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the middle ganga basin covering an area of 99 058 sq km around 400 water samples were evaluated to determine the geochemical evolution of the shallow groundwater in mgb the weighted average water quality index wawqi shows 20 2 of the groundwater are unsuitable for drinking purposes the ca hco3 water facies dominates in northern region in the interfluves of ghaghara and west rapti rivers whereas more evolved water types such as mg hco3 na hco3 are found in the interfluves area of ghaghara ganga yamuna and gomati rivers the occurrence of more mineralized water with increasing residence time in the flow direction suggests geogenic control and evolution follow the chebotarev sequence the saline water type is observed in and around the settlement reflecting the in situ enrichment due to stagnation and anthropogenic activities hierarchical cluster analysis classified the regional groundwater data into three distinct major groups g1 g2 and g3 factor 1 is attributed to anthropogenic inputs and associated with subgroup g2b and group g3 factor 2 is attributable to the geogenic factors and is associated with subgroups g1a g1b and g2a the various bivariate plots confirm the dominance of silicate weathering over carbonate weathering in the study area geochemical mass balance modeling suggests calcite and dolomite are in saturation to oversaturation conditions restricting their further dissolution and primary silicate minerals controlling the groundwater chemistry our work reveals hydrogeochemical evolution on a regional scale in the shallow groundwater which will help to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies graphical abstract figure various chemometric and multivariate statistical analysis resulting into development of a conceptual model delineating the middle ganga basin mgb into three different zones based on general relief residence time tds and major water facies image 1 keywords multivariate statistical analysis hydrogeochemical evolution geochemical mass balance modeling middle ganga basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indo gangetic plain is one of the most important transboundary water resources and the most exploited aquifer system in the world panda and wahr 2016 bonsor et al 2017 however the rampant abstraction of groundwater over the years for irrigation domestic purposes and industrial uses has led to the overexploitation of aquifers in this region rodell et al 2009 macdonald et al 2016 similar major alluvial aquifer systems of the world have also undergone water table declination as a result of unchecked groundwater extraction konikow and kendy 2005 gautam et al 2020 joshi et al 2021 studies indicate about 40 of global agrarian and 70 of indian agrarian is dependent on groundwater and hence it is a major consumer of this precious natural resource gandhi and namboodiri 2009 rodell et al 2018 a rapid fall in the groundwater table has led to reduced base flow of streams and rivers saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifer and destruction of aquatic life worldwide thomas and famiglietti 2019 joshi et al 2021 moreover due to rapid urbanization and industrialization the deterioration of groundwater quality is a major threat along with the quantity depletion macdonald et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 shekhar et al 2020 nijesh et al 2021 pant et al 2021 therefore a regular and systematic groundwater quality monitoring and assessment is essential to track the contamination of groundwater and the factors influencing it in order to develop a sustainable aquifer management strategy bonsor et al 2017 the unusual shift in the rainfall pattern aided with huge abstraction of groundwater has caused water table decline in last 30 years in many parts of the northern india this quantification loss of groundwater is often emphasized over the groundwater quality degradation in terms of major heavy metals and organic pollutants macdonald et al 2016 2016de graaf et al 2017 the ganga alluvial plain is heavily inhabited i e 10 of the global population and the livelihood of the major population in the middle ganga basin mgb is dependent on agriculture world bank 2011 with the introduction of surface water irrigation in the 19th century agrochemicals in the 20th century urban development and groundwater irrigation the indo gangetic plain has witnessed an intensified agricultural activity mukherjee and kuroda 2003 the use of groundwater for irrigation in the gangetic plain increased manifold after the green revolution program launched by the government of india in the sixties kumar et al 2005 baweja et al 2017 due to poor irrigation practices several parts of the gangetic plain has undergone soil and groundwater salinization due to excessive use of groundwater for irrigation kamra et al 2002 nijesh et al 2021 apart from the usage in agriculture the consumption of groundwater has risen steadily in the recent years because of high population growth and industrialization in this region ambast et al 2006 further to increase the crop yield the use of fertilizers and pesticides has increasedall over the country including ganga alluvial plain kamra et al 2002 as a result india ranks second largest consumer of fertilizers in the world after china the excessive application of fertilizers and pesticides in association with large scale pumping and induced irrigation return flow may enable pollutants mobilization to shallow aquifers due to vertical connectivity lapworth et al 2017 this would induce secondary reactions in the aquifer minerals resulting in the mobilization of toxic contaminants and thereby affecting the human health other sources of contaminants to the groundwater are the rampant discharge of partially or untreated sewage and industrial effluents into surface water bodies which finally seeps into the ground and contaminate the shallow aquifers appelo and postma 2005 lapworth et al 2017 2018 overall elevated inorganic solutes e g chloride fluoride nitrate uranium arsenic etc above the recommended levels are reported from the various parts of the indo gangetic plain chakraborti et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 yadav et al 2020 kumar et al 2021a 2021b nijesh et al 2021 pant et al 2021 pal et al 2022 gupta et al 2022 maurya and saxena 2022 singh et al 2022 gautam et al 2022 khan et al 2022 several studies till now have been majorly focused on a smaller scale in the middle ganga basin janardhana raju et al 2011 nandimandalam 2012 pant et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a 2021b therefore shallow groundwater which is heavily utilized for domestic purposes needs special attention to comprehend the geogenic and anthropogenic control on the contamination of groundwater on a regional scale which remains a paradox till date the chemical characterization of groundwater is a function of various factors such as silicate weathering carbonate dissolution ion and reverse ion exchange reactions redox condition evaporation contamination due to anthropogenic activities etc a better understanding of the various factors influencing the water chemistry geochemical processes occurring within aquifer in different geological and hydrogeological setup across the world has been rigorously studied through numerous statistical techniques like hydrochemical scatter plots simple linear regression trilinear plots multiple regression analysis multivariate statistical analysis msa geospatial and remote sensing methods mathematical and geochemical modeling estimation of mineral phase equilibrium and many more cloutier et al 2008 kumar et al 2021a 2021b ansari et al 2022 pant et al 2021 cloutier et al 2008 studied the sedimentary rock aquifer of canada to decipher the factors responsible for the hydrogeochemical evolution through msa while king et al 2014 used this method to assess the alluvial aquifer stream connectivity in australia likewise in the ganga river basin geochemical processes occurring within aquifer and hydrogeochemical evolution has been studied successfully by numerous researchers through the use of msa various graphical plots and correlation matrix pant et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a 2021b gautam et al 2022 singh et al 2022 khan et al 2022 geospatial techniques are useful in visualization of spatial and temporal data and has been utilized worldwide with success to decipher groundwater potential zones to understand the seasonal variation in the contaminants in different hydrogeological setup etc nijesh et al 2021 pant et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a 2021b abate et al 2022 farid et al 2022 therefore a geochemical multivariate statistical and a geospatial study was applied in the present study for the improved understanding of the shallow groundwater in the middle ganga basin with the following objectives i groundwater quality characterization and evaluation of potability of groundwater for municipal supply requirements using wawqi ii understanding the regional scale hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater and iii assessment of geospatial variability of inorganic contaminants in groundwater on a regional scale overall this study is idiosyncratic to investigate the governing mechanisms driving the geochemical evolution of groundwater on a regional scale in the phreatic aquifer of the middle ganga basin which is drained by river ganga and its major five tributaries covering an area of 99 058 km2 this study will act as a baseline for hydrogeochemical studies in a similar alluvial setting worldwide 2 study area the present work encompasses an area of 99 058 km2 lying between 78 40 e to 86 10 e longitudes and 24 00 n to 28 40 n latitudes it falls in the middle ganga basin including 29 districts of uttar pradesh state india the ganga plain is located in an active tectonic setting and the bulk of the sediments filled in this foreland basin originates from the himalayas which is subject to periodic tectonism and climatic variability shukla and janardhana raju 2008 geomorphologically the mgb is characterized by bhangar khadar khola and bhur and the drainage pattern varies from surface feature such as river meanders channel incision producing river terraces and numerous abandoned channels singh 1996 rivers such as ganga ghaghara yamuna gomti sai rapti and their tributaries drain the major portion of the study area fig 1 the highland rivers such as ganga ghaghara and yamuna are dominated by carbonate weathering sarin et al 1989 the river system of the ganga plain is mainly characterized by narrow valleys which are separated by large interfluves sinha et al 2005 thus whole area can be divided into many major interfluves of which the northern region is in the interfluve of ghaghara and west rapti which has comparatively higher relief and is adjacent to the foothills of the himalayas this region is covered mainly by tarai zone the characteristic lithology of this zone is hard clays and kankar mehta and adyalkar 1962 the ganga and ghaghara river interfluve is characterized by mainly older alluvium and gentler slope while the ganga and yamuna interfluve is characterized by both older and younger alluvium deposits singh 1996 the humid subtropical climate is the characteristic feature of the study area and is defined by the three seasons march to may is summer november to february is winter while the monsoon season is from june to september the summers are hot and dry with an average day temperature of 40 5 c followed by a rainy period the winters are usually dry and cold and the lowest temperature can dip as low as 2 to 6 c the mean annual rainfall for the year 2015 was 574 mm lowest in fatehpur district 108 8 mm while highest in the bahraich district 895 2 mm fig 2 c the mean annual evapotranspiration of the study area was 1484 mm central ground water board cgwb 2016 the southwest monsoon system is responsible for more than 80 of rainfall in the area and the river discharge generally peaks during the monsoon which then gradually decreases with time the general regional slope is from west to east and most of the rivers in the middle ganga basin follow a southeasterly direction singh 1996 2 1 hydrogeology hydrogeological characterization of the study area reveals two units viz unconsolidated zone alluvial plain and the consolidated hard rock zone cgwb 2016 the major part of the study area is covered by the alluvial sediments while the southernmost part is distinguished by vindhyan and precambrian formations the alluvial plain is further classified into two units the younger alluvium which is confined to the present day flood plain area while the older alluvium that occupies a comparatively higher portion and covers the major part of the region the unconsolidated zone is both porous and permeable and can be potentially exploited for groundwater based on lithological characteristics the ganga plain aquifers can be classified into four types the first i e shallow aquifer is extending between depths of 0 0 150 m bgl the second aquifer varies from 160 to 210 m bgl third aquifer is from 250 to 360 m bgl deep and the fourth aquifer is situated at depth between 380 and 600 mbgl cgwb 2020 the shallow aquifer is in unconfined condition and mostly supplies water for drinking and irrigation through private and public tube wells while the deeper second to fourth aquifers are in confined condition and are utilized only to a limited extent the presence of vindhyan sandstone limestone and shale underlain by precambrian rocks characterizes the southernmost part of the region cgwb 2012 13 these precambrian strata are hard compact and devoid of any primary porosity groundwater is primarily found in the secondary porosity in these rocks various pumping tests conducted has reported the mean transmissivity value of alluvial aquifer in the indo gangetic plain as 3000 m2 d while hydraulic conductivity varies from 5 to 100 m day the specific yield reported for top 200 m alluvial aquifer varies from 0 1 to 0 15 cgwb 2010 bonsor et al 2017 the hydraulic conductivity of alluvial phreatic aquifer is more than that of precambrian hard rocks in the study area 3 materials and methods the groundwater samples were collected from the entire ganga plain in the post monsoon 2015 by central groundwater board cgwb mainly from the hand pumps tapping the phreatic aquifer at each sampling sites the wells were purged few minutes before collecting a representative sample it was then collected and filtered through micro separations filter paper nylon syringe 0 45 μm filters and stored at 4 c in hdpe bottles with watertight caps following the norms of apha 2005 for major anions a separate set of water samples for major cations from the same sites were collected and preserved after treating with ultra pure hno3 to bring down the ph 2 in order to diminish the bacterial activities for the present study 381 groundwater samples from the shallow aquifer were selected and analyzed to characterize the groundwater quality and to understand the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in mgb the various physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples such as ph tds ec co3 2 hco3 cl f no3 so4 2 po4 3 and sio2 were examined as per apha 2005 the ph and ec were measured in situ by portable waterproof hanna hi98191 instrument the concentration of hco3 co3 2 mg2 and ca2 were determined by the titrimetric method using suitable reagents and cl was analyzed by mohr s method the k and na were analyzed using a flame photometer while f no3 so4 2 po4 3 and sio2 were analyzed by uv spectrophotometer before the analyses of the sample instruments were calibrated as per the standard norms the minimum detectable limit mdl of various ions by this method is about 1 mg l except for fluoride which is about 0 2 mg l the charge balance error cbe tz meq l 0 9925 tz meq l 0 0077 r2 0 99 was found well below 5 pant et al 2021 the concentrations of various hydrochemical parameters were compared with bis 2012 and who 2011 for this study the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm usgs earth explorer the various thematic maps were prepared using arcgis 10 5 and statistical parameters were evaluated in microsoft excel and ibm spss geochemist s workbench software was used for the calculation of saturation index si of various minerals the equation for si is given as 1 s i log k i a p k s p where kiap is the dissociated mineral s ion activity product ksp is defined as the solubility product of a mineral si 0 implies that the mineral is in equilibrium with the groundwater the negative value of si reflects that the groundwater is undersaturated for that particular mineral and a positive value of si shows that the groundwater is oversaturated the mineral stability diagram was prepared in diagrammes software 3 1 weighted arithmetic water quality index this method assesses the threats to the water quality and develops better groundwater organization techniques to control contamination for drinking and irrigation uses for the present study eleven parameters ph co3 2 hco3 f so4 2 cl no3 th tds ca2 and mg2 have been chosen to calculate weighted arithmetic water quality index wawqi wawqi technique utilizes only those parameters which are of particular interest and in this work we have used the parameters that affect the groundwater quality based on the major ion chemistry the following steps have been taken to calculate 1 proportionality constant k is obtained by 2 k 1 i 1 n s i where s i is the permissible limit of each parameter for which wawqi has to be estimated 2 calculation of water quality rating q n 3 q n v n v 0 s i v 0 x 100 where v n is the observed value of each variable in each sample s i is the permissible limit of each variable and v 0 is the ideal value of each variable which is 0 except for the ph 7 4 a unit parameter w n for each parameter 4 w n k s i after getting the value of qn and wn wawqi can be calculated by using the formula written below 5 w a w q i w n q n w n 4 1 statistical approach the chemical properties of all 381 water samples were subjected to descriptive statistical analyses the lowest maximum average and standard deviation of each variable was calculated on 13 parameters hierarchical cluster analysis hca and factor analysis fa was done table 4 the ca and fa were applied to log transformed and standardized data for all variables except ph since the various variables were skewed guler et al 2002 hence the log variables are closer to a normal distribution and all observations standardized to their standard z scores which got almost the same weight in the dataset the ca subdivided the samples into statistically distinct hydrogeochemical groups that may be significant to the hydrogeological or environmental settings of the study area the most distinctive groups were created using ward s linkage and the euclidean distance method for similarity evaluation guler et al 2002 each member of a group is more similar to its peers than to anyone outside of the group for each ca group heatmap of spearman s correlation matrix was created in r studio the factor analysis was carried out to reduce the dataset dimensions into new uncorrelated variables and to yield the general relationship between initial variables in the chemical dataset and to make easier geochemical interpretation of the multivariate patterns the comprehensive interpretation of the new variables referred to as factors provides vision into the main hydrogeochemical processes that determine the distribution pattern of groundwater chemistry the principal component method and the varimax rotation that minimizes the variation among the variables under each factor is used to extract the factors only factors with eigenvalues exceeding 1 are retained according to the guttman kaiser criterion cloutier et al 2008 king et al 2014 the factor scores representing the contribution of each factor at each site are computed to identify the main controlling factor s 5 results and discussion the following sections deals with the hydrochemical assessment and evolution of groundwater on a regional scale 5 1 groundwater level and flow direction the depth to water level for pre and post monsoon 2015 varied from 0 42 to 30 m bgl and 0 63 22 m bgl respectively fig 2 a b the water table contour map fig 2 c shows the groundwater flow direction follows the regional topography of ganga plain which is from north west to south east singh 1996 a narrow patch in the central region shows an increase in the groundwater level for post monsoon season is indicative of monsoonal recharge fig 2b however hotspots around the urban to semi urban regions highlights the influence of over pumping of shallow groundwater in the densely populated and intensive agricultural regions of the study area 5 2 groundwater quality the general statistics of the groundwater samples n 381 are given in table 1 the ph ranged from 7 0 to 9 1 and mean of 8 0 indicative of alkaline groundwater 5 8 of the samples exceeded the ph acceptable value set by who 2011 and bis 2012 fluoride concentration in 4 2 of the total samples was beyond the permissible limit and 7 6 of the groundwater samples are exceeding the permissible limit of nitrate bis 2012 bicarbonate and sodium are the major anion and cation respectively and the abundance of cation follows an order of na ca2 mg2 k while that of anion is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f according to the davis and de wiest 1966 classification based on tds 96 4 of the groundwater samples are fit for drinking purposes table 2 the classification of water samples based on the total hardness sawyer and mccarty 1978 indicate that 11 3 of the water samples fall in the soft to a moderately hard category 64 6 of the samples fall in the hard type and 24 1 of the samples are of very hard water type table 2 the wawqi calculated for drinking purposes varied from 8 2 to 186 9 with a mean value of 37 7 the wawqi classification is given in table 3 which shows that maximum groundwater samples are appropriate for drinking purposes out of the 381 samples 304 79 8 samples belong to excellent to good water quality while the remaining samples 77 20 2 show poor to unsuitable water type 5 3 statistical analysis the hierarchical cluster factor and spearman s correlation analysis are used to understand the spatial variability and hydrogeochemical processes driving the groundwater chemistry 5 3 1 cluster analysis a dendrogram is used to classify the samples into clusters or groups and one can specify a larger or fewer number of clusters by sliding the phenon line up or down respectively on the dendrogram ghesquière et al 2015 pant et al 2021 based on the 13 physico chemical parameters cluster analysis classified the samples into 3 groups i e g1 g2 and g3 and 4 subgroups g1a g1b g2a and g2b fig 3 a g1 with two subgroups g1a n 101 and g1b n 131 g2 with two subgroups g2a n 31 and g2b n 16 and g3 n 102 the inspection of the dendrogram provides some indication of the dissimilarity level between the groups and subgroups the linkage distance between g1 and the other two groups is elevated at 25 indicating that g1 is hydrogeochemically different from the other two groups whereas g2 and g3 are related at a linkage distance of 16 showing more coherence the stiff diagram fig 3b of the median chemical composition of groundwater indicates that g1a and g1b showed a similar extent of mineralization however g1b samples are more enriched with na k and mg2 in comparison to g1a the g2a and g2b have similar shapes however the extent of mineralization is significantly greater for g2b enriched in cl and so4 2 g3 samples show more close association with the subgroup g2b with a high extent of mineralization g3 and g2 samples may belong to the same family of water type with advanced hydrochemical evolution however g3 samples have an extremely higher proportion of ca2 than the g2b subgroup while in g2b na k mg2 is largely greater than ca2 concentration as compared to g3 all these differences indicate active variation in hydrochemical processes in the study area 5 3 2 factor analysis factor analysis reduces a large dataset into a lesser number of factors or principal components pc based on the kaiser principle five components with eigenvalues greater than one are identified and these are responsible for 78 34 variation in the dataset table 4 pc1 explains 26 48 of the overall variation and is positively loaded with cl so4 2 na and no3 pc1 can be treated as a salinization factor cloutier et al 2008 due to this association the majority of the samples from g3 group and g2b subgroup belong to this factor fig 4 a anthropogenic inputs are due to agriculture domestic waste chemical fertilizers and manure akpataku et al 2020 the 20 49 of the total variance is explained by pc2 which is in positive weightings for hco3 mg2 na and k and defined as a natural component based on the loading scores of ions which is a result of the silicate and carbonate weathering this component contributes to the mineralization of samples from groups g1 and g2b and to some extent group g3 fig 4a pc3 is in positive loading with ph and co3 2 but negative loading with ca2 and explains 15 78 of the total variance suggesting the loss of ca2 while alkalinity increases due to carbonate precipitation the group g2 samples recorded the highest factorial scores for pc3 component fig 4b which is also reflected in the water facies for this group as mg hco3 and na hco3 pc4 and pc5 explain 7 87 and 7 72 of the total variation respectively table 4 pc4 is in positive loading with f and negative loading with k while pc5 is in positive loading with sio2 these two component might indicate processes related to water rock interactions the samples from all the groups were affected by these two factors fig 4c and d 5 3 3 spearman correlation spearman s matrix is a non parametric method of correlation the heat map of the g1a subgroup fig 5 a shows ec has a significant correlation with the ions such as hco3 mg2 na ca2 k and with sio2 showing the control of these ions on the groundwater chemistry of this subgroup the hco3 is correlated with all the major cations such as mg2 ca2 and na which is generally due to carbonic acid driven hydrolysis of minerals such as silicate and carbonate akpataku et al 2020 it is also reflected in the water types i e ca hco3 and mg hco3 and na hco3 the g1b subgroup shows ec dependency on ions such as hco3 mg2 na and to some extent on cl while hco3 shows correlation with mg2 and na and is well manifested by water type of this subgroup as mg hco3 and na hco3 the no3 is negatively correlated with hco3 and the median ph value of this subgroup is 7 9 as an indication of an alkaline condition enhancing the denitrification process akpataku et al 2020 the g2a subgroup shows slight dependence of ph on co3 2 ion concentration in the subgroups g2a g2b and group g3 the ec value shows a strong positive correlation with mg2 na so4 2 hco3 cl and no3 ions fig 5c d and e the hco3 ion is positively correlated with so4 2 mg2 na and cl ions the cl show strong correlation with so4 2 which is mainly due to human inputs through irrigation return flow urban and animal waste menció et al 2016 akpataku et al 2020 nijesh et al 2021 5 4 hydrogeochemical facies the most common water type in the study region is mg hco3 followed by ca hco3 na hco3 and a few water samples belonging to saline water facies such as na k cl and mg ca cl fig 6 a the spatial variability map reveals that mg hco3 which is about 45 of the total water types and is spread over the entire study area fig 6b generally mg hco3 water type is attributed to recharge areas along with ca hco3 but no such trend is observed as it is well spread throughout the study area the widespread occurrence of calcareous nodules and dolomite throughout the study area in the form of thin lenses in the older alluvium has been widely reported which is responsible for the formation of mg hco3 type water janardhana raju et al 2011 saba et al 2016 nijesh et al 2021 the ca hco3 is the second most abundant facies about 25 of the total samples belong to this water type lying between the interfluve of ghaghara and west rapti this interfluve represents the northern portion of the study area which is closer to the foothills of the himalayas fig 6b geomorphologically this area has higher relief than the other parts of the study area therefore the groundwater close to the foothill of the himalayas fig 1 would have lower residence time to evolve and rainwater quickly recharges the shallow aquifers additionally minimum water rock interaction leads to this type of water facies about 23 of the total water facies is na hco3 in the present study area which is considered a more evolved water type as compared to ca hco3 and mg hco3 the spatial distribution map shows that these facies mainly occur in the lower reaches of the rivers ganga ghaghara and yamuna interfluves it is due to rock water interaction as a result of more residence time in the flow direction aided with ion exchange reactions attributes to a more evolved water type the saline water type such as na cl ca mg cl is mainly scattered in and around the settlement and agricultural field reflecting the influence of water stagnation and anthropogenic activities hydrochemical facies reveals that ca hco3 has the lowest tds value range while na cl is the most evolved water type with maximum tds values in the study area fig 6c aquifers with bicarbonate type water facies are characterized by low mineralization low alkalinity due to short residence time and recent recharge through the precipitation toscano et al 2020 groundwater with the shortest residence time is generally bicarbonated and then sulfated and the water with the highest residence time is chlorinated in the flow direction this evolution sequence is called chebotarev sequence chebotarev 1955 in the case of cationic composition ca2 is maximum with the shortest residence time followed by mg2 and finally na group wise facies distribution suggests that the ca hco3 facies mostly fall in the g1a and g1b subgroups in which the g1a subgroup is dominated by ca hco3 type and thought to be the least evolved subgroup among all g1a samples mainly lie in the northern portion of the study area in the interfluves of ghaghara and west rapti river this region lies in the tarai region which is adjacent to the himalayan foothills figs 1 and 7 this region is characterized by higher relief and is made of hard clays and kankar mehta and adyalkar 1962 the higher elevation and relief are inducive for the fast recharge and steep slope allow comparatively faster movement of groundwater and minimal influence of anthropogenic impacts the mg hco3 type of water is present in all the groups of which g1b and g3 alone constitute more than 65 of this water type the more evolved water type na hco3 is mainly observed in the g3 group the ca mg cl and na cl water types are observed mainly in g2b subgroup and g3 group which is scattered in and around the settlement and agricultural field reflecting the influence of water stagnation and anthropogenic activities moreover spatial variability of groundwater fig 6 b facies mainly changes from ca mg hco3 to na hco3 thus the groundwater chemistry evolved along the flow path in the distal part of the basin 5 5 rock water interactions and solute acquisition process water rock interaction anthropogenic impacts or a combination of both can cause several hydrogeochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry gibbs 1970 depicted the three primary mechanisms influencing the principal ion chemistry of groundwater comprising rock water interaction evaporation and atmospheric rainfall fig 7 a and b as per the gibbs plot all the groups mainly fall under the rock dominance category however few samples with lower tds from subgroups g1a and g2a fall toward the zone of rainwater chemistry this is in coherence with their major water types discussed in the previous sections low salinity of such water type indicates recently infiltrated waters from recharge areas with limited mixing frape et al 1984 gascoyne and kamineni 1994 subgroup g1b shows exclusively dominance of geology the subgroup g2b and the group g3 are with higher tds and shifted from water rock domain towards the evaporation control zone and showing the influence of anthropogenic activities it corresponds to mixed intermediate or advanced water types rajmohan and elango 2004 subramani et al 2010 thus the results of ca fa stiff piper and gibbs infer that groundwater chemistry of g1a resulted from quick recharge g1b has undergone some modifications g2a and g2b show further evolution while group g3 is the most evolved group among all the spatial distribution of water facies also corroborates with these findings fig 6b 5 5 1 mineral weathering and dissolution the carbonic acid driven weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals in the aquifer matrix of the study area can be described by following equations 6 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 7 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 2 h 2 c o 3 9 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 2 n a 4 h 4 s i o 4 2 h c o 3 8 c a c o 3 2 h 2

understand the weathering fig 8a indicates that the geochemical nature of a few samples particularly from the group g1 and subgroup g2a are affected by carbonates dissolution along with gypsum the stoichiometry of the carbonate and gypsum weathering reactions requires that carbonate derived hco3 so4 2 be equal to carbonate derived ca2 mg2 pant et al 2021 when bicarbonate originates from calcite the ca2 hco3 molar ratio is 1 2 while from dolomite the ca2 mg2 hco3 molar ratio is 1 4 mackenzie and garrels 1971 holland 1978 for the present study it has been observed that there is an excess of anions over ca2 mg2 for all the groups fig 8a b and c indicating the control of silicate minerals weathering on hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the study area however excess ca2 mg2 in a few samples belonging to group g3 show additional sources of alkaline earth cations that might be due to carbonate dissolution or reverse ion exchange the groundwater samples falling along the line tz 2 na k fig 8d and the excess of na over cl fig 8e support that silicate minerals weathering is more prominent than carbonate minerals dissolution stallard and edmond 1983 sarin et al 1989 with an average of 2 07 and a median of 1 27 the na cl value suggests that atmospheric precipitation plays a minor role in groundwater solutes with weathering of rock accounting for the majority of solutes zhang et al 1995 about 60 of the total groundwater samples show molar ratio of na cl 1 fig 8e indicating excess sodium due to weathering of silicate bearing rocks and dissolution of alkaline saline soil which further contributes na to the groundwater rajmohan and elango 2004 kumar et al 2018 chatterjee and singh 2022 it is also evident by the high concentration of silica up to 104 mg l table 1 that silicate weathering plays an important role in the liberation of na into the groundwater the majority of rivers draining the study area originate in the higher himalayas which has schist gneiss and leucogranite as the main lithology and is responsible for the increased concentration of silicate minerals singh et al 2006 in addition to this tributaries of yamuna drain the peninsular craton which is dominated by several types of granites resulting in a higher sodium ion concentration singh et al 2008 the dominance of silicate weathering and the abundance of ca2 and mg2 ions in the groundwater samples can be attributed to ca2 and mg2 bearing silicates such as ca feldspar biotite and carbonate calcite and dolomite weathering whereas the na and k derived from alkali silicate weathering verma et al 2015 in the plot of tds vs na cl fig 8e samples from subgroup g2b and group g3 with high mineralization tds 500 mg l it has been observed for g3 38 of the samples have na cl 1 indicative of excess chloride source from human inputs through agricultural practices sewage pollution and leachate percolation nijesh et al 2021 5 5 2 cation exchange most of the groups showing an excess of hco3 and so4 2 over ca2 and mg2 in fig 8a and b indicates ion exchange process cerling et al 1989 this can be explained by the reaction below eq 10 10 n a c l a y c a 2 m g 2 g w 2 n a g w c a 2 m g 2 c l a y the plot of na cl vs ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 fig 8f samples falling along the line with a slope of 1 show the cation exchange process in the aquifer system this plot signifies the amount of na k gained or lost with respect to cl is balanced with ca2 mg2 lost or gained with respect to hco3 so4 2 respectively for most of the groups an ion exchange reaction is observed however few samples of group g3 fall in the domain of reverse ion exchange which might have increased ca2 and mg2 concentration for this group in addition to this ion exchange and reverse ion exchange occurring in the study area can also be inferred by chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 schoeller 1967 evaluated with equations 11 and 12 all values expressed in meq l 11 c a i 1 c l n a k c l 12 c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 h c o 3 c o 3 n o 3 both indices are positive when there is an exchange of na or k from groundwater with mg2 or ca2 from the aquifer matrix showing reverse ion exchange while negative values indicate an exchange of ca2 or mg2 from groundwater with na or k from the aquifer matrix indicating ion exchange rajmohan and elango 2004 for g2a and g2b highest negative average values are obtained for both the indices followed by g1b and g1a indicating the dominance of ion exchange for these groups while for group g3 least negative average values are observed for both the indices and few groundwater samples showing positive values indicating reverse ion exchange for these samples which increases the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions 5 6 geochemical mass balance modeling the saturation index for different minerals indicates that dolomite and calcite show a positive saturation index for 100 and 96 of the samples respectively supplementary fig 1 the positive values indicative of saturation to over saturation conditions and their further dissolution is prohibited minerals such as gypsum fluorite halite and kainite the groundwater is undersaturated and more dissolution of these minerals into the groundwater with increasing residence time will increase the concentration of respective minerals for silica polymorphs quartz and chalcedony the si values are near equilibrium to oversaturation suggesting that these minerals are prone to deposit while si values for amorphous silica indicate undersaturation thermodynamic equilibrium conditions the mineral stability diagrams help to depict the main silicate weathering processes and as well as the clay minerals in equilibrium with groundwater supplementary figs 2a 2c quartz muscovite biotite and feldspars are the main primary silicate minerals identified in the ganga plain encompassing the study area and their weathering forms such as illite and smectite as major clay minerals huyghe et al 2011 phase relationship of groundwater and coexisting minerals indicate groundwater mineralization under the control of thermodynamic equilibrium with chlorite kaolinite mica minerals and alkali feldspars supplementary figs 2a 2c ca plagioclase illite and smectite minerals appear less stable in their equilibrium with groundwater which may dissolve to a certain extent supplementary fig 2a suggests subgroups g1a and g1b are confined to the chlorite field while subgroups g2a and g2b mainly fall in the biotite field however g2a falls in both chlorite and biotite fields the most varied group among all is g3 falling in the chlorite biotite and k feldspar mineral stability field reflecting the control of both primary and secondary silicate minerals in this group supplementary fig 2b shows g1a and g1b falls mostly in the chlorite domain the subgroups g2a and g2b fall in both chlorite and biotite fields again most varied among all is g3 falling in kaolinite chlorite and biotite mineral stability fields supplementary fig 2c indicates subgroups g1a and g1b falling in the kaolinite field among the g2 g2a falls mostly in the kaolinite field and very few of the samples of this subgroup fall in the albite domain while g2b mostly falls in the albite field group g3 falls both in the kaolinite and albite mineral stability fields 5 7 development of a conceptual model based on the hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and geospatial aspects a model fig 9 was conceptualized which divided the whole region into three zones the zone 1 is representative of interfluve of ghaghara and west rapti which is in the proximity of the himalayan foothills this zone is characterized by ca hco3 water type and groundwater samples are mainly from subgroup g1a zone 2 which is a broad interfluve zone of ganga and ghaghara has undergone more mineralization as reflected in the water chemistry and group types this zone is also covered by both older and younger alluvium lastly zone 3 which is the interfluve of ganga and yamuna and is the most evolved among all the zones this might be due to increased local anthropogenic activities as suggested by the water types of this zone however this might also be due to the different sources of sediments transported by the rivers to these three zones majority of the rivers originating from the himalayas are rich in mica while those draining the peninsular and feeding yamuna are rich in orthoclase and devoid of mica shukla and janardhana raju 2008 6 conclusion the present investigation is a part of mgb and the chemometric result confirms that groundwater is slightly alkaline in nature and major cation dominance is in the order of na ca2 mg2 k while that of anion is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f the ca grouped the groundwater samples into five different sub groups viz g1a g1b g2a g2b and g3 the msa and various hydrochemical proxies suggests that subgroup g1a is the least evolved among all subgroups and most of the samples of this subgroup belong to ca hco3 water type which is attributed to recent recharge with less residence time and minimum water rock interaction and is mostly located in the northern region of the study area group g3 and subgroup g2b are the most varied showing water types such as mg hco3 na hco3 and na cl as a result of increase in rock water interaction in the flow direction and through anthropogenic inputs thus hydrogeochemical characterization of phreatic groundwater follows the chebotarev sequence in the flow direction on a regional scale which confirms the dominance lithological control on groundwater chemistry while local variations are due to human induced activities the role of silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions are more dominant over carbonate weathering in the evolution of groundwater ghaghara and west rapti interfluve show carbonate weathering as manifested by ca hco3 water type while ganga and ghaghara is manifested by more rock water interaction and silicate weathering dominance as evident from mg hco3 and na hco3 water types the conceptual model based division of study area into 3 zones can be linked to the variation of different sediments sources deposited by major rivers forming multi storied alluvial aquifer systems and also due to local anthropogenic activities overall the region relies heavily on groundwater for irrigation and drinking needs and both its quantity and quality are deteriorating therefore present study will be helpful to policy makers and establishment of groundwater management strategies on a regional scale however for better insight into the groundwater dynamics aquifer connectivity recharge sources and residence time on such a large scale requires use of environmental isotopes 18o 2h and 3h which is one of the

11688,middle ganga basin mgb is lifeline for millions of inhabitants relying heavily on the groundwater this has resulted in depletion of water quality and quantity at a very rapid scale the present study has emphasized on hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the middle ganga basin covering an area of 99 058 sq km around 400 water samples were evaluated to determine the geochemical evolution of the shallow groundwater in mgb the weighted average water quality index wawqi shows 20 2 of the groundwater are unsuitable for drinking purposes the ca hco3 water facies dominates in northern region in the interfluves of ghaghara and west rapti rivers whereas more evolved water types such as mg hco3 na hco3 are found in the interfluves area of ghaghara ganga yamuna and gomati rivers the occurrence of more mineralized water with increasing residence time in the flow direction suggests geogenic control and evolution follow the chebotarev sequence the saline water type is observed in and around the settlement reflecting the in situ enrichment due to stagnation and anthropogenic activities hierarchical cluster analysis classified the regional groundwater data into three distinct major groups g1 g2 and g3 factor 1 is attributed to anthropogenic inputs and associated with subgroup g2b and group g3 factor 2 is attributable to the geogenic factors and is associated with subgroups g1a g1b and g2a the various bivariate plots confirm the dominance of silicate weathering over carbonate weathering in the study area geochemical mass balance modeling suggests calcite and dolomite are in saturation to oversaturation conditions restricting their further dissolution and primary silicate minerals controlling the groundwater chemistry our work reveals hydrogeochemical evolution on a regional scale in the shallow groundwater which will help to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies graphical abstract figure various chemometric and multivariate

introduction indo gangetic plain is one of the most important transboundary water resources and the most exploited aquifer system in the world panda and wahr 2016 bonsor et al 2017 however the rampant abstraction of groundwater over the years for irrigation domestic purposes and industrial uses has led to the overexploitation of aquifers in this region rodell et al 2009 macdonald et al 2016 similar major alluvial aquifer systems of the world have also undergone water table declination as a result of unchecked groundwater extraction konikow and kendy 2005 gautam et al 2020 joshi et al 2021 studies indicate about 40 of global agrarian and 70 of indian agrarian is dependent on groundwater and hence it is a major consumer of this precious natural resource gandhi and namboodiri 2009 rodell et al 2018 a rapid fall in the groundwater table has led to reduced base flow of streams and rivers saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifer and destruction of aquatic life worldwide thomas and famiglietti 2019 joshi et al 2021 moreover due to rapid urbanization and industrialization the deterioration of groundwater quality is a major threat along with the quantity depletion macdonald et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 shekhar et al 2020 nijesh et al 2021 pant et al 2021 therefore a regular and systematic groundwater quality monitoring and assessment is essential to track the contamination of groundwater and the factors influencing it in order to develop a sustainable aquifer management strategy bonsor et al 2017 the unusual shift in the rainfall pattern aided with huge abstraction of groundwater has caused water table decline in last 30 years in many parts of the northern india this quantification loss of groundwater is often emphasized over the groundwater quality degradation in terms of major heavy metals and organic pollutants macdonald et al 2016 2016de graaf et al 2017 the ganga alluvial plain is heavily inhabited i e 10 of the global population and the livelihood of the major population in the middle ganga basin mgb is dependent on agriculture world bank 2011 with the introduction of surface water irrigation in the 19th century agrochemicals in the 20th century urban development and groundwater irrigation the indo gangetic plain has witnessed an intensified agricultural activity mukherjee and kuroda 2003 the use of groundwater for irrigation in the gangetic plain increased manifold after the green revolution program launched by the government of india in the sixties kumar et al 2005 baweja et al 2017 due to poor irrigation practices several parts of the gangetic plain has undergone soil and groundwater salinization due to excessive use of groundwater for irrigation kamra et al 2002 nijesh et al 2021 apart from the usage in agriculture the consumption of groundwater has risen steadily in the recent years because of high population growth and industrialization in this region ambast et al 2006 further to increase the crop yield the use of fertilizers and pesticides has increasedall over the country including ganga alluvial plain kamra et al 2002 as a result india ranks second largest consumer of fertilizers in the world after china the excessive application of fertilizers and pesticides in association with large scale pumping and induced irrigation return flow may enable pollutants mobilization to shallow aquifers due to vertical connectivity lapworth et al 2017 this would induce secondary reactions in the aquifer minerals resulting in the mobilization of toxic contaminants and thereby affecting the human health other sources of contaminants to the groundwater are the rampant discharge of partially or untreated sewage and industrial effluents into surface water bodies which finally seeps into the ground and contaminate the shallow aquifers appelo and postma 2005 lapworth et al 2017 2018 overall elevated inorganic solutes e g chloride fluoride nitrate uranium arsenic etc above the recommended levels are reported from the various parts of the indo gangetic plain chakraborti et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 yadav et al 2020 kumar et al 2021a 2021b nijesh et al 2021 pant et al 2021 pal et al 2022 gupta et al 2022 maurya and saxena 2022 singh et al 2022 gautam et al 2022 khan et al 2022 several studies till now have been majorly focused on a smaller scale in the middle ganga basin janardhana raju et al 2011 nandimandalam 2012 pant et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a 2021b therefore shallow groundwater which is heavily utilized for domestic purposes needs special attention to comprehend the geogenic and anthropogenic control on the contamination of groundwater on a regional scale which remains a paradox till date the chemical characterization of groundwater is a function of various factors such as silicate weathering carbonate dissolution ion and reverse ion exchange reactions redox condition evaporation contamination due to anthropogenic activities etc a better understanding of the various factors influencing the water chemistry geochemical processes occurring within aquifer in different geological and hydrogeological setup across the world has been rigorously studied through numerous statistical techniques like hydrochemical scatter plots simple linear regression trilinear plots multiple regression analysis multivariate statistical analysis msa geospatial and remote sensing methods mathematical and geochemical modeling estimation of mineral phase equilibrium and many more cloutier et al 2008 kumar et al 2021a 2021b ansari et al 2022 pant et al 2021 cloutier et al 2008 studied the sedimentary rock aquifer of canada to decipher the factors responsible for the hydrogeochemical evolution through msa while king et al 2014 used this method to assess the alluvial aquifer stream connectivity in australia likewise in the ganga river basin geochemical processes occurring within aquifer and hydrogeochemical evolution has been studied successfully by numerous researchers through the use of msa various graphical plots and correlation matrix pant et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a 2021b gautam et al 2022 singh et al 2022 khan et al 2022 geospatial techniques are useful in visualization of spatial and temporal data and has been utilized worldwide with success to decipher groundwater potential zones to understand the seasonal variation in the contaminants in different hydrogeological setup etc nijesh et al 2021 pant et al 2021 kumar et al 2021a 2021b abate et al 2022 farid et al 2022 therefore a geochemical multivariate statistical and a geospatial study was applied in the present study for the improved understanding of the shallow groundwater in the middle ganga basin with the following objectives i groundwater quality characterization and evaluation of potability of groundwater for municipal supply requirements using wawqi ii understanding the regional scale hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater and iii assessment of geospatial variability of inorganic contaminants in groundwater on a regional scale overall this study is idiosyncratic to investigate the governing mechanisms driving the geochemical evolution of groundwater on a regional scale in the phreatic aquifer of the middle ganga basin which is drained by river ganga and its major five tributaries covering an area of 99 058 km2 this study will act as a baseline for hydrogeochemical studies in a similar alluvial setting worldwide 2 study area the present work encompasses an area of 99 058 km2 lying between 78 40 e to 86 10 e longitudes and 24 00 n to 28 40 n latitudes it falls in the middle ganga basin including 29 districts of uttar pradesh state india the ganga plain is located in an active tectonic setting and the bulk of the sediments filled in this foreland basin originates from the himalayas which is subject to periodic tectonism and climatic variability shukla and janardhana raju 2008 geomorphologically the mgb is characterized by bhangar khadar khola and bhur and the drainage pattern varies from surface feature such as river meanders channel incision producing river terraces and numerous abandoned channels singh 1996 rivers such as ganga ghaghara yamuna gomti sai rapti and their tributaries drain the major portion of the study area fig 1 the highland rivers such as ganga ghaghara and yamuna are dominated by carbonate weathering sarin et al 1989 the river system of the ganga plain is mainly characterized by narrow valleys which are separated by large interfluves sinha et al 2005 thus whole area can be divided into many major interfluves of which the northern region is in the interfluve of ghaghara and west rapti which has comparatively higher relief and is adjacent to the foothills of the himalayas this region is covered mainly by tarai zone the characteristic lithology of this zone is hard clays and kankar mehta and adyalkar 1962 the ganga and ghaghara river interfluve is characterized by mainly older alluvium and gentler slope while the ganga and yamuna interfluve is characterized by both older and younger alluvium deposits singh 1996 the humid subtropical climate is the characteristic feature of the study area and is defined by the three seasons march to may is summer november to february is winter while the monsoon season is from june to september the summers are hot and dry with an average day temperature of 40 5 c followed by a rainy period the winters are usually dry and cold and the lowest temperature can dip as low as 2 to 6 c the mean annual rainfall for the year 2015 was 574 mm lowest in fatehpur district 108 8 mm while highest in the bahraich district 895 2 mm fig 2 c the mean annual evapotranspiration of the study area was 1484 mm central ground water board cgwb 2016 the southwest monsoon system is responsible for more than 80 of rainfall in the area and the river discharge generally peaks during the monsoon which then gradually decreases with time the general regional slope is from west to east and most of the rivers in the middle ganga basin follow a southeasterly direction singh 1996 2 1 hydrogeology hydrogeological characterization of the study area reveals two units viz unconsolidated zone alluvial plain and the consolidated hard rock zone cgwb 2016 the major part of the study area is covered by the alluvial sediments while the southernmost part is distinguished by vindhyan and precambrian formations the alluvial plain is further classified into two units the younger alluvium which is confined to the present day flood plain area while the older alluvium that occupies a comparatively higher portion and covers the major part of the region the unconsolidated zone is both porous and permeable and can be potentially exploited for groundwater based on lithological characteristics the ganga plain aquifers can be classified into four types the first i e shallow aquifer is extending between depths of 0 0 150 m bgl the second aquifer varies from 160 to 210 m bgl third aquifer is from 250 to 360 m bgl deep and the fourth aquifer is situated at depth between 380 and 600 mbgl cgwb 2020 the shallow aquifer is in unconfined condition and mostly supplies water for drinking and irrigation through private and public tube wells while the deeper second to fourth aquifers are in confined condition and are utilized only to a limited extent the presence of vindhyan sandstone limestone and shale underlain by precambrian rocks characterizes the southernmost part of the region cgwb 2012 13 these precambrian strata are hard compact and devoid of any primary porosity groundwater is primarily found in the secondary porosity in these rocks various pumping tests conducted has reported the mean transmissivity value of alluvial aquifer in the indo gangetic plain as 3000 m2 d while hydraulic conductivity varies from 5 to 100 m day the specific yield reported for top 200 m alluvial aquifer varies from 0 1 to 0 15 cgwb 2010 bonsor et al 2017 the hydraulic conductivity of alluvial phreatic aquifer is more than that of precambrian hard rocks in the study area 3 materials and methods the groundwater samples were collected from the entire ganga plain in the post monsoon 2015 by central groundwater board cgwb mainly from the hand pumps tapping the phreatic aquifer at each sampling sites the wells were purged few minutes before collecting a representative sample it was then collected and filtered through micro separations filter paper nylon syringe 0 45 μm filters and stored at 4 c in hdpe bottles with watertight caps following the norms of apha 2005 for major anions a separate set of water samples for major cations from the same sites were collected and preserved after treating with ultra pure hno3 to bring down the ph 2 in order to diminish the bacterial activities for the present study 381 groundwater samples from the shallow aquifer were selected and analyzed to characterize the groundwater quality and to understand the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in mgb the various physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples such as ph tds ec co3 2 hco3 cl f no3 so4 2 po4 3 and sio2 were examined as per apha 2005 the ph and ec were measured in situ by portable waterproof hanna hi98191 instrument the concentration of hco3 co3 2 mg2 and ca2 were determined by the titrimetric method using suitable reagents and cl was analyzed by mohr s method the k and na were analyzed using a flame photometer while f no3 so4 2 po4 3 and sio2 were analyzed by uv spectrophotometer before the analyses of the sample instruments were calibrated as per the standard norms the minimum detectable limit mdl of various ions by this method is about 1 mg l except for fluoride which is about 0 2 mg l the charge balance error cbe tz meq l 0 9925 tz meq l 0 0077 r2 0 99 was found well below 5 pant et al 2021 the concentrations of various hydrochemical parameters were compared with bis 2012 and who 2011 for this study the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm usgs earth explorer the various thematic maps were prepared using arcgis 10 5 and statistical parameters were evaluated in microsoft excel and ibm spss geochemist s workbench software was used for the calculation of saturation index si of various minerals the equation for si is given as 1 s i log k i a p k s p where kiap is the dissociated mineral s ion activity product ksp is defined as the solubility product of a mineral si 0 implies that the mineral is in equilibrium with the groundwater the negative value of si reflects that the groundwater is undersaturated for that particular mineral and a positive value of si shows that the groundwater is oversaturated the mineral stability diagram was prepared in diagrammes software 3 1 weighted arithmetic water quality index this method assesses the threats to the water quality and develops better groundwater organization techniques to control contamination for drinking and irrigation uses for the present study eleven parameters ph co3 2 hco3 f so4 2 cl no3 th tds ca2 and mg2 have been chosen to calculate weighted arithmetic water quality index wawqi wawqi technique utilizes only those parameters which are of particular interest and in this work we have used the parameters that affect the groundwater quality based on the major ion chemistry the following steps have been taken to calculate 1 proportionality constant k is obtained by 2 k 1 i 1 n s i where s i is the permissible limit of each parameter for which wawqi has to be estimated 2 calculation of water quality rating q n 3 q n v n v 0 s i v 0 x 100 where v n is the observed value of each variable in each sample s i is the permissible limit of each variable and v 0 is the ideal value of each variable which is 0 except for the ph 7 4 a unit parameter w n for each parameter 4 w n k s i after getting the value of qn and wn wawqi can be calculated by using the formula written below 5 w a w q i w n q n w n 4 1 statistical approach the chemical properties of all 381 water samples were subjected to descriptive statistical analyses the lowest maximum average and standard deviation of each variable was calculated on 13 parameters hierarchical cluster analysis hca and factor analysis fa was done table 4 the ca and fa were applied to log transformed and standardized data for all variables except ph since the various variables were skewed guler et al 2002 hence the log variables are closer to a normal distribution and all observations standardized to their standard z scores which got almost the same weight in the dataset the ca subdivided the samples into statistically distinct hydrogeochemical groups that may be significant to the hydrogeological or environmental settings of the study area the most distinctive groups were created using ward s linkage and the euclidean distance method for similarity evaluation guler et al 2002 each member of a group is more similar to its peers than to anyone outside of the group for each ca group heatmap of spearman s correlation matrix was created in r studio the factor analysis was carried out to reduce the dataset dimensions into new uncorrelated variables and to yield the general relationship between initial variables in the chemical dataset and to make easier geochemical interpretation of the multivariate patterns the comprehensive interpretation of the new variables referred to as factors provides vision into the main hydrogeochemical processes that determine the distribution pattern of groundwater chemistry the principal component method and the varimax rotation that minimizes the variation among the variables under each factor is used to extract the factors only factors with eigenvalues exceeding 1 are retained according to the guttman kaiser criterion cloutier et al 2008 king et al 2014 the factor scores representing the contribution of each factor at each site are computed to identify the main controlling factor s 5 results and discussion the following sections deals with the hydrochemical assessment and evolution of groundwater on a regional scale 5 1 groundwater level and flow direction the depth to water level for pre and post monsoon 2015 varied from 0 42 to 30 m bgl and 0 63 22 m bgl respectively fig 2 a b the water table contour map fig 2 c shows the groundwater flow direction follows the regional topography of ganga plain which is from north west to south east singh 1996 a narrow patch in the central region shows an increase in the groundwater level for post monsoon season is indicative of monsoonal recharge fig 2b however hotspots around the urban to semi urban regions highlights the influence of over pumping of shallow groundwater in the densely populated and intensive agricultural regions of the study area 5 2 groundwater quality the general statistics of the groundwater samples n 381 are given in table 1 the ph ranged from 7 0 to 9 1 and mean of 8 0 indicative of alkaline groundwater 5 8 of the samples exceeded the ph acceptable value set by who 2011 and bis 2012 fluoride concentration in 4 2 of the total samples was beyond the permissible limit and 7 6 of the groundwater samples are exceeding the permissible limit of nitrate bis 2012 bicarbonate and sodium are the major anion and cation respectively and the abundance of cation follows an order of na ca2 mg2 k while that of anion is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f according to the davis and de wiest 1966 classification based on tds 96 4 of the groundwater samples are fit for drinking purposes table 2 the classification of water samples based on the total hardness sawyer and mccarty 1978 indicate that 11 3 of the water samples fall in the soft to a moderately hard category 64 6 of the samples fall in the hard type and 24 1 of the samples are of very hard water type table 2 the wawqi calculated for drinking purposes varied from 8 2 to 186 9 with a mean value of 37 7 the wawqi classification is given in table 3 which shows that maximum groundwater samples are appropriate for drinking purposes out of the 381 samples 304 79 8 samples belong to excellent to good water quality while the remaining samples 77 20 2 show poor to unsuitable water type 5 3 statistical analysis the hierarchical cluster factor and spearman s correlation analysis are used to understand the spatial variability and hydrogeochemical processes driving the groundwater chemistry 5 3 1 cluster analysis a dendrogram is used to classify the samples into clusters or groups and one can specify a larger or fewer number of clusters by sliding the phenon line up or down respectively on the dendrogram ghesquière et al 2015 pant et al 2021 based on the 13 physico chemical parameters cluster analysis classified the samples into 3 groups i e g1 g2 and g3 and 4 subgroups g1a g1b g2a and g2b fig 3 a g1 with two subgroups g1a n 101 and g1b n 131 g2 with two subgroups g2a n 31 and g2b n 16 and g3 n 102 the inspection of the dendrogram provides some indication of the dissimilarity level between the groups and subgroups the linkage distance between g1 and the other two groups is elevated at 25 indicating that g1 is hydrogeochemically different from the other two groups whereas g2 and g3 are related at a linkage distance of 16 showing more coherence the stiff diagram fig 3b of the median chemical composition of groundwater indicates that g1a and g1b showed a similar extent of mineralization however g1b samples are more enriched with na k and mg2 in comparison to g1a the g2a and g2b have similar shapes however the extent of mineralization is significantly greater for g2b enriched in cl and so4 2 g3 samples show more close association with the subgroup g2b with a high extent of mineralization g3 and g2 samples may belong to the same family of water type with advanced hydrochemical evolution however g3 samples have an extremely higher proportion of ca2 than the g2b subgroup while in g2b na k mg2 is largely greater than ca2 concentration as compared to g3 all these differences indicate active variation in hydrochemical processes in the study area 5 3 2 factor analysis factor analysis reduces a large dataset into a lesser number of factors or principal components pc based on the kaiser principle five components with eigenvalues greater than one are identified and these are responsible for 78 34 variation in the dataset table 4 pc1 explains 26 48 of the overall variation and is positively loaded with cl so4 2 na and no3 pc1 can be treated as a salinization factor cloutier et al 2008 due to this association the majority of the samples from g3 group and g2b subgroup belong to this factor fig 4 a anthropogenic inputs are due to agriculture domestic waste chemical fertilizers and manure akpataku et al 2020 the 20 49 of the total variance is explained by pc2 which is in positive weightings for hco3 mg2 na and k and defined as a natural component based on the loading scores of ions which is a result of the silicate and carbonate weathering this component contributes to the mineralization of samples from groups g1 and g2b and to some extent group g3 fig 4a pc3 is in positive loading with ph and co3 2 but negative loading with ca2 and explains 15 78 of the total variance suggesting the loss of ca2 while alkalinity increases due to carbonate precipitation the group g2 samples recorded the highest factorial scores for pc3 component fig 4b which is also reflected in the water facies for this group as mg hco3 and na hco3 pc4 and pc5 explain 7 87 and 7 72 of the total variation respectively table 4 pc4 is in positive loading with f and negative loading with k while pc5 is in positive loading with sio2 these two component might indicate processes related to water rock interactions the samples from all the groups were affected by these two factors fig 4c and d 5 3 3 spearman correlation spearman s matrix is a non parametric method of correlation the heat map of the g1a subgroup fig 5 a shows ec has a significant correlation with the ions such as hco3 mg2 na ca2 k and with sio2 showing the control of these ions on the groundwater chemistry of this subgroup the hco3 is correlated with all the major cations such as mg2 ca2 and na which is generally due to carbonic acid driven hydrolysis of minerals such as silicate and carbonate akpataku et al 2020 it is also reflected in the water types i e ca hco3 and mg hco3 and na hco3 the g1b subgroup shows ec dependency on ions such as hco3 mg2 na and to some extent on cl while hco3 shows correlation with mg2 and na and is well manifested by water type of this subgroup as mg hco3 and na hco3 the no3 is negatively correlated with hco3 and the median ph value of this subgroup is 7 9 as an indication of an alkaline condition enhancing the denitrification process akpataku et al 2020 the g2a subgroup shows slight dependence of ph on co3 2 ion concentration in the subgroups g2a g2b and group g3 the ec value shows a strong positive correlation with mg2 na so4 2 hco3 cl and no3 ions fig 5c d and e the hco3 ion is positively correlated with so4 2 mg2 na and cl ions the cl show strong correlation with so4 2 which is mainly due to human inputs through irrigation return flow urban and animal waste menció et al 2016 akpataku et al 2020 nijesh et al 2021 5 4 hydrogeochemical facies the most common water type in the study region is mg hco3 followed by ca hco3 na hco3 and a few water samples belonging to saline water facies such as na k cl and mg ca cl fig 6 a the spatial variability map reveals that mg hco3 which is about 45 of the total water types and is spread over the entire study area fig 6b generally mg hco3 water type is attributed to recharge areas along with ca hco3 but no such trend is observed as it is well spread throughout the study area the widespread occurrence of calcareous nodules and dolomite throughout the study area in the form of thin lenses in the older alluvium has been widely reported which is responsible for the formation of mg hco3 type water janardhana raju et al 2011 saba et al 2016 nijesh et al 2021 the ca hco3 is the second most abundant facies about 25 of the total samples belong to this water type lying between the interfluve of ghaghara and west rapti this interfluve represents the northern portion of the study area which is closer to the foothills of the himalayas fig 6b geomorphologically this area has higher relief than the other parts of the study area therefore the groundwater close to the foothill of the himalayas fig 1 would have lower residence time to evolve and rainwater quickly recharges the shallow aquifers additionally minimum water rock interaction leads to this type of water facies about 23 of the total water facies is na hco3 in the present study area which is considered a more evolved water type as compared to ca hco3 and mg hco3 the spatial distribution map shows that these facies mainly occur in the lower reaches of the rivers ganga ghaghara and yamuna interfluves it is due to rock water interaction as a result of more residence time in the flow direction aided with ion exchange reactions attributes to a more evolved water type the saline water type such as na cl ca mg cl is mainly scattered in and around the settlement and agricultural field reflecting the influence of water stagnation and anthropogenic activities hydrochemical facies reveals that ca hco3 has the lowest tds value range while na cl is the most evolved water type with maximum tds values in the study area fig 6c aquifers with bicarbonate type water facies are characterized by low mineralization low alkalinity due to short residence time and recent recharge through the precipitation toscano et al 2020 groundwater with the shortest residence time is generally bicarbonated and then sulfated and the water with the highest residence time is chlorinated in the flow direction this evolution sequence is called chebotarev sequence chebotarev 1955 in the case of cationic composition ca2 is maximum with the shortest residence time followed by mg2 and finally na group wise facies distribution suggests that the ca hco3 facies mostly fall in the g1a and g1b subgroups in which the g1a subgroup is dominated by ca hco3 type and thought to be the least evolved subgroup among all g1a samples mainly lie in the northern portion of the study area in the interfluves of ghaghara and west rapti river this region lies in the tarai region which is adjacent to the himalayan foothills figs 1 and 7 this region is characterized by higher relief and is made of hard clays and kankar mehta and adyalkar 1962 the higher elevation and relief are inducive for the fast recharge and steep slope allow comparatively faster movement of groundwater and minimal influence of anthropogenic impacts the mg hco3 type of water is present in all the groups of which g1b and g3 alone constitute more than 65 of this water type the more evolved water type na hco3 is mainly observed in the g3 group the ca mg cl and na cl water types are observed mainly in g2b subgroup and g3 group which is scattered in and around the settlement and agricultural field reflecting the influence of water stagnation and anthropogenic activities moreover spatial variability of groundwater fig 6 b facies mainly changes from ca mg hco3 to na hco3 thus the groundwater chemistry evolved along the flow path in the distal part of the basin 5 5 rock water interactions and solute acquisition process water rock interaction anthropogenic impacts or a combination of both can cause several hydrogeochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry gibbs 1970 depicted the three primary mechanisms influencing the principal ion chemistry of groundwater comprising rock water interaction evaporation and atmospheric rainfall fig 7 a and b as per the gibbs plot all the groups mainly fall under the rock dominance category however few samples with lower tds from subgroups g1a and g2a fall toward the zone of rainwater chemistry this is in coherence with their major water types discussed in the previous sections low salinity of such water type indicates recently infiltrated waters from recharge areas with limited mixing frape et al 1984 gascoyne and kamineni 1994 subgroup g1b shows exclusively dominance of geology the subgroup g2b and the group g3 are with higher tds and shifted from water rock domain towards the evaporation control zone and showing the influence of anthropogenic activities it corresponds to mixed intermediate or advanced water types rajmohan and elango 2004 subramani et al 2010 thus the results of ca fa stiff piper and gibbs infer that groundwater chemistry of g1a resulted from quick recharge g1b has undergone some modifications g2a and g2b show further evolution while group g3 is the most evolved group among all the spatial distribution of water facies also corroborates with these findings fig 6b 5 5 1 mineral weathering and dissolution the carbonic acid driven weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals in the aquifer matrix of the study area can be described by following equations 6 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 7 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 2 h 2 c o 3 9 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 2 n a 4 h 4 s i o 4 2 h c o 3 8 c a c o 3 2 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 2 h c o 3 9 c a m g c o 3 2 2 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 4 h c o 3 bivariate plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 co3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 vs hco3 co3 2 and ca2 vs hco3 co3 2 are presented in fig 8 a b and c to understand the weathering fig 8a indicates that the geochemical nature of a few samples particularly from the group g1 and subgroup g2a are affected by carbonates dissolution along with gypsum the stoichiometry of the carbonate and gypsum weathering reactions requires that carbonate derived hco3 so4 2 be equal to carbonate derived ca2 mg2 pant et al 2021 when bicarbonate originates from calcite the ca2 hco3 molar ratio is 1 2 while from dolomite the ca2 mg2 hco3 molar ratio is 1 4 mackenzie and garrels 1971 holland 1978 for the present study it has been observed that there is an excess of anions over ca2 mg2 for all the groups fig 8a b and c indicating the control of silicate minerals weathering on hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the study area however excess ca2 mg2 in a few samples belonging to group g3 show additional sources of alkaline earth cations that might be due to carbonate dissolution or reverse ion exchange the groundwater samples falling along the line tz 2 na k fig 8d and the excess of na over cl fig 8e support that silicate minerals weathering is more prominent than carbonate minerals dissolution stallard and edmond 1983 sarin et al 1989 with an average of 2 07 and a median of 1 27 the na cl value suggests that atmospheric precipitation plays a minor role in groundwater solutes with weathering of rock accounting for the majority of solutes zhang et al 1995 about 60 of the total groundwater samples show molar ratio of na cl 1 fig 8e indicating excess sodium due to weathering of silicate bearing rocks and dissolution of alkaline saline soil which further contributes na to the groundwater rajmohan and elango 2004 kumar et al 2018 chatterjee and singh 2022 it is also evident by the high concentration of silica up to 104 mg l table 1 that silicate weathering plays an important role in the liberation of na into the groundwater the majority of rivers draining the study area originate in the higher himalayas which has schist gneiss and leucogranite as the main lithology and is responsible for the increased concentration of silicate minerals singh et al 2006 in addition to this tributaries of yamuna drain the peninsular craton which is dominated by several types of granites resulting in a higher sodium ion concentration singh et al 2008 the dominance of silicate weathering and the abundance of ca2 and mg2 ions in the groundwater samples can be attributed to ca2 and mg2 bearing silicates such as ca feldspar biotite and carbonate calcite and dolomite weathering whereas the na and k derived from alkali silicate weathering verma et al 2015 in the plot of tds vs na cl fig 8e samples from subgroup g2b and group g3 with high mineralization tds 500 mg l it has been observed for g3 38 of the samples have na cl 1 indicative of excess chloride source from human inputs through agricultural practices sewage pollution and leachate percolation nijesh et al 2021 5 5 2 cation exchange most of the groups showing an excess of hco3 and so4 2 over ca2 and mg2 in fig 8a and b indicates ion exchange process cerling et al 1989 this can be explained by the reaction below eq 10 10 n a c l a y c a 2 m g 2 g w 2 n a g w c a 2 m g 2 c l a y the plot of na cl vs ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 fig 8f samples falling along the line with a slope of 1 show the cation exchange process in the aquifer system this plot signifies the amount of na k gained or lost with respect to cl is balanced with ca2 mg2 lost or gained with respect to hco3 so4 2 respectively for most of the groups an ion exchange reaction is observed however few samples of group g3 fall in the domain of reverse ion exchange which might have increased ca2 and mg2 concentration for this group in addition to this ion exchange and reverse ion exchange occurring in the study area can also be inferred by chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 schoeller 1967 evaluated with equations 11 and 12 all values expressed in meq l 11 c a i 1 c l n a k c l 12 c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 h c o 3 c o 3 n o 3 both indices are positive when there is an exchange of na or k from groundwater with mg2 or ca2 from the aquifer matrix showing reverse ion exchange while negative values indicate an exchange of ca2 or mg2 from groundwater with na or k from the aquifer matrix indicating ion exchange rajmohan and elango 2004 for g2a and g2b highest negative average values are obtained for both the indices followed by g1b and g1a indicating the dominance of ion exchange for these groups while for group g3 least negative average values are observed for both the indices and few groundwater samples showing positive values indicating reverse ion exchange for these samples which increases the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions 5 6 geochemical mass balance modeling the saturation index for different minerals indicates that dolomite and calcite show a positive saturation index for 100 and 96 of the samples respectively supplementary fig 1 the positive values indicative of saturation to over saturation conditions and their further dissolution is prohibited minerals such as gypsum fluorite halite and kainite the groundwater is undersaturated and more dissolution of these minerals into the groundwater with increasing residence time will increase the concentration of respective minerals for silica polymorphs quartz and chalcedony the si values are near equilibrium to oversaturation suggesting that these minerals are prone to deposit while si values for amorphous silica indicate undersaturation thermodynamic equilibrium conditions the mineral stability diagrams help to depict the main silicate weathering processes and as well as the clay minerals in equilibrium with groundwater supplementary figs 2a 2c quartz muscovite biotite and feldspars are the main primary silicate minerals identified in the ganga plain encompassing the study area and their weathering forms such as illite and smectite as major clay minerals huyghe et al 2011 phase relationship of groundwater and coexisting minerals indicate groundwater mineralization under the control of thermodynamic equilibrium with chlorite kaolinite mica minerals and alkali feldspars supplementary figs 2a 2c ca plagioclase illite and smectite minerals appear less stable in their equilibrium with groundwater which may dissolve to a certain extent supplementary fig 2a suggests subgroups g1a and g1b are confined to the chlorite field while subgroups g2a and g2b mainly fall in the biotite field however g2a falls in both chlorite and biotite fields the most varied group among all is g3 falling in the chlorite biotite and k feldspar mineral stability field reflecting the control of both primary and secondary silicate minerals in this group supplementary fig 2b shows g1a and g1b falls mostly in the chlorite domain the subgroups g2a and g2b fall in both chlorite and biotite fields again most varied among all is g3 falling in kaolinite chlorite and biotite mineral stability fields supplementary fig 2c indicates subgroups g1a and g1b falling in the kaolinite field among the g2 g2a falls mostly in the kaolinite field and very few of the samples of this subgroup fall in the albite domain while g2b mostly falls in the albite field group g3 falls both in the kaolinite and albite mineral stability fields 5 7 development of a conceptual model based on the hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and geospatial aspects a model fig 9 was conceptualized which divided the whole region into three zones the zone 1 is representative of interfluve of ghaghara and west rapti which is in the proximity of the himalayan foothills this zone is characterized by ca hco3 water type and groundwater samples are mainly from subgroup g1a zone 2 which is a broad interfluve zone of ganga and ghaghara has undergone more mineralization as reflected in the water chemistry and group types this zone is also covered by both older and younger alluvium lastly zone 3 which is the interfluve of ganga and yamuna and is the most evolved among all the zones this might be due to increased local anthropogenic activities as suggested by the water types of this zone however this might also be due to the different sources of sediments transported by the rivers to these three zones majority of the rivers originating from the himalayas are rich in mica while those draining the peninsular and feeding yamuna are rich in orthoclase and devoid of mica shukla and janardhana raju 2008 6 conclusion the present investigation is a part of mgb and the chemometric result confirms that groundwater is slightly alkaline in nature and major cation dominance is in the order of na ca2 mg2 k while that of anion is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f the ca grouped the groundwater samples into five different sub groups viz g1a g1b g2a g2b and g3 the msa and various hydrochemical proxies suggests that subgroup g1a is the least evolved among all subgroups and most of the samples of this subgroup belong to ca hco3 water type which is attributed to recent recharge with less residence time and minimum water rock interaction and is mostly located in the northern region of the study area group g3 and subgroup g2b are the most varied showing water types such as mg hco3 na hco3 and na cl as a result of increase in rock water interaction in the flow direction and through anthropogenic inputs thus hydrogeochemical characterization of phreatic groundwater follows the chebotarev sequence in the flow direction on a regional scale which confirms the dominance lithological control on groundwater chemistry while local variations are due to human induced activities the role of silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions are more dominant over carbonate weathering in the evolution of groundwater ghaghara and west rapti interfluve show carbonate weathering as manifested by ca hco3 water type while ganga and ghaghara is manifested by more rock water interaction and silicate weathering dominance as evident from mg hco3 and na hco3 water types the conceptual model based division of study area into 3 zones can be linked to the variation of different sediments sources deposited by major rivers forming multi storied alluvial aquifer systems and also due to local anthropogenic activities overall the region relies heavily on groundwater for irrigation and drinking needs and both its quantity and quality are deteriorating therefore present study will be helpful to policy makers and establishment of groundwater management strategies on a regional scale however for better insight into the groundwater dynamics aquifer connectivity recharge sources and residence time on such a large scale requires use of environmental isotopes 18o 2h and 3h which is one of the

11689,detailed geochemical and stable isotopic δdh2o δ18oh2o and δ13cdic study of groundwater samples n 74 from a semi arid region in western india was carried out to constrain their solute sources and sub surface weathering processes na cl and hco3 dominate major ion chemistry this type of chemistry points to a significant solute supply from the salt affected soils and bedrock dissolution the average δ18o and δd in our groundwater samples are similar to their corresponding values in precipitation samples spatial variability of the δ18o and δd data depicts the impact of continental effect and variable extent of evaporation in this region the δ18o δd cross plot yields a lower slope 5 2 0 5 than that of the global meteoric water line 8 confirming the significant impact of evaporation on groundwater hydrology δ13cdic values vary between 7 3 and 16 4 average 9 7 1 7 and first order binary mixing calculation shows that about 75 16 of the dic in these samples are supplied via carbonate dissolution range 35 100 inverse model calculations involving elemental ratios of major ions show that the solutes are mainly supplied through salt affected soils 30 22 with sub ordinate contributions from rain 31 13 silicate 23 12 and carbonate 15 13 these estimates are consistent with the formation of salt affected soils via evaporative water loss in semi arid regions and the faster dissolution kinetics of these soil salts the outcomes of this study underscore distinctly different compositions of semi arid groundwater reservoirs which has implications for drinking and irrigation usage graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater stable isotopes geochemistry weathering inverse modelling salt affected soils data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the predominant water resource for domestic and agricultural needs particularly in arid and semi arid regions with limited surface water availability in these regions the groundwater recharge rate is lower than its withdrawal rate moridi et al 2018 resulting in the depletion of the water table and drying up of aquifers in longer timescales van der kamp and hayashi 1998 in india groundwater withdrawals are more than 25 of global withdrawals shen et al 2008 mukherjee and singh 2018 more than 60 of irrigated agriculture and 85 of drinking water supplies in rural regions of india depend on groundwater resources world bank report 2010 identifying the sources and origin of groundwater and understanding geochemical processes regulating groundwater quality are of fundamental importance for the sustainable management of this resource in these regions in this regard chemical and isotopic studies of groundwater are primarily useful in assessing hydrological aspects e g recharge and groundwater flow groundwater quality solute sources and factors regulating their chemistry e g catchment rock type aquifer type land use land cover and water rock interaction clark and fritz 1997 edmunds and shand 2009 herczeg and leaney 2011 these fundamental hydrochemical investigations provide valuable insights and have motivated researchers to work on groundwater treatment and modelling to find novel effective and cost effective solutions to groundwater contamination goswami and kumar 2018 siddique et al 2020 high f in groundwaters has been reported in different countries and india ali et al 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 mandal et al 2021 in the western parts of india high f were reported from the states of rajasthan and gujarat hussain et al 2010 datta et al 1999 previously we reported high fluoride levels in a semi arid region in western india mandal et al 2021 and evaluated the non carcinogenic risk to the region s local population in this study we present the major ion chemistry and stable isotopic composition of groundwater samples from the same region to infer their solute sources and sub surface weathering processes the groundwater resource from these regions has often been linked to two societal issues lowering the groundwater table and groundwater contamination e g salinity fluoride and nitrate consistently we reported the extent of potential health risks to the 2 3 million local population because of the high fluoride in these reservoirs mandal et al 2021 additionally this region has been reported to have large exposure to saline alkaline sodic non calcic soils dhiman and keshari 2006 however the role of leaching of these salt affected soils with fast dissolution kinetics on groundwater chemistry has received limited attention recently khatri et al 2020 investigated the groundwater water quality index in a small pocket nine villages in the satlasana sub district mehsana from the aquifer mentioned above however available studies from this region dhiman and keshari 2006 khatri et al 2020 have not attempted in great detail about the sources and origin of solutes in these regional aquifers with depleting water tables bradley and phadtare 1989 karunakalage et al 2021 this study aims to i quantify the solute sources and intensity of water rock interaction in these semi arid aquifers from western india by using major ions data and their inverse modelling ii trace groundwater origin from the water isotope data δ18o and δd and identify the role of evaporation in altering isotopic signatures and iii identify sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic from stable carbon isotopes of dic δ13cdic and delineate silicate versus carbonate weathering processes this comprehensive study provides baseline chemical and hitherto unavailable isotopic data on regional groundwater in turn this can help validate groundwater quality models and provide a detailed scientific understanding of groundwater geochemistry required for the sustainable management of this resource 2 study area this study is part of our ongoing research on groundwater geochemistry in western india mandal et al 2021 the present study has mainly been conducted in a hot and arid region mehsana district gujarat covering an area of 4371 km2 fig 1 the monthly rainfall around this region at deesa varies between 0 1 mm april and 216 mm july with an annual rainfall of 580 mm cgwb report 2014 the southwest monsoon season june july august and september accounts for 80 of the annual rainfall the temperature of this area ranges from 10 c to 41 c the air humidity is low 35 during march and high 77 during august the evapotranspiration rates vary between 3 3 and 8 2 mm day 1 cgwb report 2014 kulkarni 1985 and phadtare 1981 reported the geology of this area briefly this area is mainly composed of quaternary alluvium with sub ordinate exposures of meta sediments sandstone and conglomerate and clay deposits further salt affected soils have also been reported in this region chinchmalatpure 2017 the salinity and sodicity of these soils are mainly linked to solute supply by continental weathering delivery of oceanic salts na cl by wind and rainfall and the capillary rise of ions from sub soil salt beds and excessive use of water for irrigation choudhary and kharche 2018 exposures of calcareous sandy loamy and non calcic red brown soils are also reported in the region dhiman and keshari 2006 cgwb 2014 groundwater occurs under phreatic and confined conditions while its development depends on aquifer geometry and yield characteristics cgwb 2014 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the study area s north eastern part primarily composed of metasediments and intrusive is through secondary porosity the typical depth 22 m 610 m and discharge 180 2496 l min 1 of the groundwater in this region have been reported by central groundwater board cgwb 2014 the depth of these groundwaters shows strong seasonality with 68 of the wells showing a rise in the water table of 0 32 m 9 46 m during the monsoon season cgwb 2014 the sub surface aquifer of this region is mainly comprised of precambrian hard rocks semi consolidated mesozoic and tertiary formations and unconsolidated quaternary alluvial deposits a major part of the study area is underlain by miocene alluvium and older sedimentary systems

were measured using the isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus using the co2 h2 equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 the precision and accuracy of the analyses were continuously monitored by using multiple aliquots of secondary laboratory standards iwin i δ18o 6 5 δd 39 8 iwin ii δ18o 11 01 δd 73 96 and iwin iii δ18o 15 07 δd 36 8 with respect to the vsmow prepared under a national programme on isotope fingerprinting of waters of india iwin deshpande and gupta 2012 the precisions for δ18o and δd measurements were better than 0 1 and 1 respectively the carbon isotopic δ13cdic analyses in the dissolved inorganic fractions of selected samples collected during 2019 were carried out before analyses these samples were poisoned with mercury chloride to eliminate bacterial growth stored in amber bottles sealed with a rubber septum and aluminum cap to avoid any gaseous exchange and wrapped with black paper to avoid direct contact with sunlight to avoid any bacterial growth the samples were kept in an ice box during field campaigns and preserved at 3 c during laboratory storage until analysis the δ13cdic of the samples was measured following established protocols bhavya et al 2017 briefly the samples were treated with ortho phosphoric acid and isotopes of the extracted co2 were measured using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 attached to a gas bench the analytical precision of δ13cdic for replicate standards was better than 0 1 sodium carbonate salt δ13c 11 4 0 1 calibrated against the nbs standard was used as an internal laboratory standard 3 2 inverse modelling of groundwater chemistry data in this study we have adopted an inverse modelling approach involving chemical data of groundwater samples and their possible major sources e g rain salt affected soils and weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals to apportion relative solute contributions from these sources the model used here is similar to that used by tripathy and das 2014 which has been successfully employed earlier for source apportionment of rivers tripathy and singh 2010 and coastal waters danish et al 2020 details of this model are part of our earlier publications tripathy and das 2014 briefly the inversion model follows a non linear optimization algorithm to find best fit that can explain the data and model parameters here the data parameters cl na ca na mg na and hco3 na are the measured compositions of the groundwater samples in contrast the model parameters are the composition of and relative contributions from four major sources the following mass balance equations relate the data and model parameters 1 c l n a i 1 4 c l n a i f i 2 c a n a i 1 4 c a n a i f i 3 m g n a i 1 4 m g n a i f i 4 h c o 3 n a i 1 4 h c o 3 n a i f i 5 1 i 1 4 f i where i 1 2 3 and 4 stand for the four major sources the term f i represents the relative supply of sodium from source i we have used na normalized ratios to avoid chemical changes due to water dilution and limited sodium sources in the watershed further we have excluded selected elements e g k no3 so4 2 due to their multiple sources including both natural and anthropogenic sources with limited chemical data the iterative algorithm starts from a set of a priori values for model parameters to find corresponding a posteriori values that can explain the mass balance equation between data and model parameters with the least residual we have used average a priori compositions for the major sources of rain chatterjee and singh 2012 silicates gaillardet et al 1999 carbonates moon et al 2007 and salt affected soils rengarajan et al 2009 in the model by compiling literature information this model yields a posteriori parameters with uncertainties including the relative fraction of solutes from each source 4 results chemical and stable isotopic data of the groundwater samples have been included in table 1 the fluoride content of these samples is from one of our earlier works mandal et al 2021 table 1 which focused on fluoride risk assessment and its geochemistry the piper plot fig 2 showed that the groundwater chemistry of our samples is mainly na cl hco3 type detailed analysis revealed that 50 of the samples fall in na cl dominated zone 15 in the na hco3 zone and 24 in the mixed type while only 5 fell in the ca cl and mg hco3 type zones grossly the trend is somewhat similar to the observation made by raychowdhury et al 2014 in the chaco pampean plain argentina this is however in contrast to the groundwater data of kumar et al 2018 from the ganga yamuna plain and mukherjee et al 2009 from the west bengal basin for example kumar et al 2018 reported 15 52 and 33 of the samples belonged to mg hco3 ca hco3 and na hco3 types respectively on average na k and ca2 mg2 account for 73 and 27 of the cationic charges tz μeq l respectively while the corresponding median values are 76 and 24 this indicates the dominance of alkali cations over alkaline earth cations to the overall charges likewise cl and hco3 dominate the anion charge tz μeq l followed by so4 2 with respective contributions of 41 45 and 9 the dissolved na content of these samples varies from 1521 to 45 352 μm with an average concentration of 14 400 8856 μm n 74 these na concentrations are about 60 times higher than the global average for rivers 240 μm however the average ca2 concentrations of these groundwater samples 975 864 μm n 74 are only 3 times higher than the global riverine ca2 concentrations the dominant anions in these samples are cl and hco3 which account for 45 and 42 of the total anionic content tz respectively average chloride concentrations 10 797 9081 μm are also two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for the local rainwater 30 μm and global rivers 167 μm meybeck and drever 2003 the alkalinity of these samples varies between 2000 and 17 633 μm with an average concentration of 7228 2947 μm these groundwater samples also have appreciable nitrate content 634 602 μm which accounts for 5 of the tz the saturation index with respect to calcite csi and dolomite dsi was calculated using the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 to know the thermodynamic tendency of these minerals to precipitate out from the groundwater calculations show that 55 and 85 of the samples are oversaturated with calcite 0 01 0 82 and dolomite 0 02 5 32 respectively in about 55 of the samples which are oversaturated with both calcite and dolomite the csi dsi ratios range from 0 04 to 4 5 with an average of 0 48 and median of 0 31 lower csi dsi values were observed in groundwater collected from the huhhot basin inner mogolia however relatively higher values were observed in the west bengal basin groundwaters mukherjee et al 2009 the δ18o and δd values range from 4 8 to 1 9 and from 35 to 17 respectively these values compare to the δ18o range of 3 7 to 21 5 and δd range of 30 to 92 reported for precipitation at a nearby site ahmedabad deshpande et al 2010 the average δ18o and δd values of our groundwater samples 3 5 0 6 and 23 9 3 8 respectively are similar to their corresponding amount weighted average values of 3 9 and 23 in precipitation samples collected during 2005 2008 deshpande et al 2010 our groundwater values compare to the range of δ18o 1 5 to 6 1 and δd 18 to 46 in groundwaters from kachchh district gujarat maurya et al 2019 δ18o 2 39 to 11 3 and δd 12 5 to 76 9 for the state of punjab krishan et al 2021 δ18o 3 3 to 8 7 and δd 37 to 60 for the ganga yamuna alluvium plain in northern india kumar et al 2018 and δ18o 0 5 to 6 1 and δd 15 to 43 in as rich groundwaters of the west bengal basin mukherjee et al 2009 the δ13cdic in our samples has a relatively narrow range 7 4 to 10 8 n 34 fig 3 except for four samples which vary between 11 9 to 16 4 the average δ13cdic when all samples considered is 9 6 1 7 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater origin understanding groundwater origin is critical to studies on groundwater resource management and groundwater contamination clark and fritz 1997 groundwater typically integrates the water isotope signals over its residence times a few years to decades or even higher and averages out minor major variations in individual isotope signals complexities in the hydrological processes operating in the atmosphere and groundwater environments e g advection mixing of vapour masses evaporation condensation mixing and dispersion can moderate the water isotope composition for individual precipitation events despite of similarity in the δ18o values between groundwater and precipitation on a relatively large scale district level the entire study area we observe a notable spatial variability between groundwater at the sub district level a gradual depletion in 18o was observed along the southwest to north east direction for the topmost four sub districts i e becharaji unjha kheralu and satlasana with δ18o values of 2 9 0 4 3 4 0 2 4 1 0 5 and 4 4 0 2 respectively a similar decrease in δ18o as a function of distance was reported for the first time in groundwater from western india by bhattacharya et al 1985 the above indicates the effect of infiltration of locally derived precipitation through the soil layers regulating the water isotope signature of the groundwater the decrease in δ18o of 1 5 observed between the averages of samples collected from becharaji 2 9 0 4 and satlasana 4 4 0 2 sub districts along a stretch of 100 km can intuitively be attributed to two possible reasons i response of the continental effect that might be occurring to the average precipitation at those places a progressive depletion in 18o as a function of distance is explained as the moisture front moves away from the coast the remaining vapour becomes progressively depleted with each rainout in the heavier isotope precipitation in the western part of india is dominated by and large by the southwest monsoon where the vapours originate from the arabian sea south southwest and travel along a north northeast direction ii evaporation of an h2o molecule taking place in the soil zone during its transit as a part of rainfall to a part of the groundwater the dxs values for becharaji unjha kheralu and satlasana are 3 5 1 3 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 and 7 3 0 8 respectively the lower dxs value see later discussion of the becharaji samples compared to the satlasana signifies more evaporation taking in the former groundwater samples however the average dxs values for the unjha and kheralu samples are similar to that of the becharaji samples indicating that the evaporation effect cannot be discerned at a lesser spatial scale from the dxs proxy therefore we conclude that both the above processes i e the continental effect and the evaporation effect might be responsible for the decrease in δ18o of 1 5 between the becharaji and satlasana groundwater samples δ18o δd cross plot fig 4 provides insight into the hydrological pathways as fractionation of the water isotopes behave in a predictable i e mass dependent way δ18o δd in precipitation from the humid and temperate regions of the world follow a linear regression δd 8 δ18o 10 known by global meteoric water line craig 1961 later refined by rozanski et al 1993 the slope of 8 represents the in cloud equilibrium fractionation process strongly dependent on temperature and the intercept of 10 the kinetic fractionation strongly dependent on humidity between ocean water and the vapour formed similarly regional precipitations follow a linear regression known by the local meteoric water line lmwl for our study the lmwl δd 7 7 δ18o 7 2 was taken from the extensive n 120 data set on water isotope in ahmedabad precipitation deshpande et al 2010 similarly the parameter d excess dxs δd 8 δ18o used to quantify the relative magnitude of kinetic fractionation is discussed in conjunction with water isotope data with progressive evaporation the residual water enriches itself in the heavier isotopes 18o and 2h however the relative enrichment of 18o being more than 2h results in dxs values less than 10 in the residual phase undergoing evaporation in a δ18o δd plot fig 4 95 of our groundwater samples fall below the gmwl suggestive of evaporation which shifts the δ18o δd signatures to positions below the gmwl four samples mm 8 mm 9 mm 10 and mvd 1 lie above the gmwl and have dxs values of 12 9 14 9 12 5 and 10 4 respectively these indicate that these four samples originated from rainfall s having a re evaporated component of moisture generally attributed to samples above gmwl two of the samples mu 1 and mvj 2 have negative dxs values of 2 5 and 5 5 except for these six samples the remaining samples have an average dxs value of 4 0 1 5 range 0 3 to 7 9 the spread in their dxs values can be explained simply by the evaporation of the meteoric signal to differential extents when all samples are considered in the δ18o δd an even lower slope of 5 2 was observed which is typical of evaporation in samples under low humidity conditions and the samples deviate from the gmwl a similar conclusion of extensive evaporation supported by lower slopes of 4 6 has been reported for groundwater samples gibson et al 1993 saka et al 2013 kumar et al 2018 for example in the indian context lower slopes of 4 81 δd 4 81 δ18o 19 2 and 5 02 δd 5 02 δ18o 17 53 were reported in shallow and middle depth groundwater samples collected from the ganga yamuna alluvial plain in northern india kumar et al 2018 these slopes are lower than the slope of 7 2 reported for the respective lmwl new delhi in addition to evaluating evaporative enrichment in groundwater from their δ18o and δ2h data recently the coupled use of water stable isotope and tritium 3h data was used in delineating the sources of recharge water krishan et al 2021 in groundwater collected from the state of punjab interestingly it was inferred that canal water is the important recharge source while evaporative enrichment is primarily responsible for increasing salinity hazard for shallow groundwater collected from the south west parts of the state krishan et al 2021 5 2 sources of solutes analyses correlation plots correlation matrix and elemental ratios of groundwater solute data provide preliminary clues to their sources and processes occurring in the sub surface aquifer environment table 2 represents the correlation matrix of hydrochemical parameters na and cl two out of the three dominant ions in the sampled groundwater exhibit a good correlation r2 0 78 n 74 suggestive of their common sources in the form of evaporites recycled salts and saline and sodic soils which all have been reported to exist in upper soils from the mehsana district dhiman and keshari 2006 interestingly na mg2 shows a linear relationship with cl so4 2 r2 0 8 fig 5 a with a slope of 0 88 and a large positive intercept of 5 7 me the slope suggests that na mg2 can account for 90 of the cl so4 2 this confirms the contribution of saline sodic alkaline salts of na and mg2 for most samples na cl equivalent ratios in the samples vary from 0 71 to 4 53 with an average of 1 69 σ 0 81 table s1 eleven of the total samples 15 show cl excess hereafter referred to as clxs i e na cl while the rest of them with na cl are termed as na excess naxs samples the chemistry data of the clxs samples indicate additional cl sources not supported by na as the counter ion the most likely reason for clxs samples in our sample set is the dissolution of mg2 salts of chlorides and sulfates present in soils interestingly these eleven samples exhibit a good correlation between the pairs of na cl r2 0 94 na so4 2 r2 0 62 mg2 cl r2 0 76 mg2 so4 2 r2 0 63 table s2 these are supported further by a linear relationship between na mg2 and cl so4 2 slope of 0 88 intercept 1594 μe r2 0 97 fig s2 and is typical characteristics of leaching of sodic saline alkaline salts present in soils to the groundwater in surface waters clxs is usually attributed to an anthropogenic origin mainly emanating from acid industry discharges and are unlikely to be the cause in our study area which is primarily rural about 85 of the samples exhibit na cl values 1 00 up to 4 53 this range of na cl variation in the sample set can be explained by increased contribution of na the decreased contribution of cl or a combination of both na cl 1 0 in surface or groundwater usually is interpreted as na to be derived from na silicates clark and fritz 1997 the role of silicate and carbonates in groundwater chemistry is conventionally inferred from the ca2 mg2 hco3 fig 5b equivalent plot if these alkali earth cations are predominantly derived from carbonic acid h2co3 mediated weathering of carbonates and or silicates and assuming congruent dissolution of silicates the data points all would fall in and around the 1 1 line most of the samples fall much below the 1 1 line signifying that hco3 is added to the groundwater at proportions higher than ca2 and mg2 a closer look into the plot reveals that one major group of samples lies between 1 1 and 1 2 lines and another between 1 2 and 1 10 lines hco3 excess therefore these observations require other cation s to balance the excess hco3 charge na being the most likely and dominant one in fact na na minus cl shows a moderate positive correlation r2 0 49 slope 0 64 y mx type of line against hco3 which hints towards their na and hco3 release by a common process or has a common source s a lower limit of hco3 associated with non calcitic dolomitic sources i e silicates or soil na salt sources such as na2co3 and nahco3 was estimated assuming all ca2 and mg2 is due to carbonate weathering and was subtracted from the total hco3 hco3non carbonate hco3total ca mg it is interesting to note that for the naxs samples na shows a very good correlation r2 0 8 y mx type of line against hco3non carbonate with a slope of 0 90 suggesting that hco3 that is not supported for by ca2 plus mg2 can account for 90 of the na that is not supported for by cl this has been interpreted to result from a combination of two pathways i weathering of albite which releases na and hco3 in equal proportions the presence of albite in soils from the mehsana district was confirmed by xrd dhiman and keshari 2006 and ii leaching weathering of alkaline soils can also release na and hco3 in equal proportions repeated cycles of wetting and evaporation in the soil zones of semi arid to arid regions are known to result in the formation of alkaline soils enriched in na2co3 sarin et al 1989 smedley et al 2003 shi 2004 mukherjee et al 2009 which can supply na and hco3 to shallow groundwater relative dominance of the two above processes in their contribution to na and hco3 is difficult to ascertain from the present major ion data however the observation that 90 of the high f samples 1 5 mg l 1 fall between the zone of 1 1 and 1 10 lines in the ca2 mg2 hco3 plot suggest that silicate weathering is also an important process for those samples silicates are known to be the major source of f in the region kulkarni 1985 dhiman and keshari 2006 furthermore support for the above mechanism to be operating in the aquifer environment was concluded from both the slope of 0 78 and a positive intercept of 1892 μe of the linear fit r2 0 79 between na cl so4 2 against hco3 non carbonate fig 5c the above is under the assumption that all so4 2 in groundwater is associated only with na e g as na2so4 and its contribution has been deducted from na assuming an equal association of sulfate to na and mg2 the respective slope and intercept values would change to 0 74 and 2517 μe in a linear fit r2 0 76 of na cl 0 5so4 against hco3 ca 0 5 mg summarizing the above discussions the role of saline alkaline sodic soils in contributing to na and mg2 with cl and so4 2 as the counter ions are evident ca is mainly derived from carbonates while the latter s role in mg contribution is comparatively less hco3 is contributed mainly by carbonates of na and alkaline earth cations with a subordinate contribution from the silicate weathering more in the next section which also supplies dissolved na to the groundwater 5 3 silicate versus carbonate weathering in groundwater environments inorganic and organic carbon forms play fundamental roles in weathering reactions the carbon cycle and the geochemical evolution of groundwater both stable and radioisotopes of carbon 13c and 14c have been used to trace the carbon cycle in groundwater clark and fritz 1997 in this study we have used isotopic ratio δ13cdic to infer the sources of carbon in groundwater and on the mechanistic pathways by which the δ13cdic has been accrued the δ13cdic in groundwater primarily depends on the weathering pathway e g silicate and or carbonate and the acid type e g carbonic and sulfuric involved in the weathering reactions isotopic composition of various dic sources their relative contributions to the dic concentration and the accompanied carbon isotope fractionations both equilibrium and kinetic during the transfer of carbon from one phase to another soil organic matter co2 g hco3 ultimately decide the δ13cdic in groundwater dic sources include carbonate minerals and soil co2 derived from soil organic matter decomposition weathering of silicates also contributes to groundwater dic which is also sourced from the soil co2 the initial δ13csoil co2 depends on the vegetation type with c3 and c4 having contrasting δ13c average values clark and fritz 1997 with partial pressures of soil co2 several times higher than the atmospheric pco2 diffusion of the soil co2 to the atmosphere occurs it is assisted by a kinetic fractionation of 4 4 leaving the residual soil co2 enriched in the heavier isotopes further transformation of soil co2 to hco3 involves a temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation of 9 at 20 c while enriching the hco3 phase in 13c therefore dic produced exclusively by silicate weathering with the underlying assumption that silicates do not contain any form of calcites and are mediated by carbonic acid will have δ13cdic higher by 13 4 compared to that of the vegetation in the case of carbonate weathering mediated by carbonic acid the δ13cdic will also depend on the δ13c of carbonates weathering of carbonates produces dic where half mole mole of it is derived from carbonate minerals and the remaining half from soil co2 thus δ13cdic derived from carbonate weathering will be the arithmetic mean of two δ13cs i of the carbonates with no fractionation involved in carbonate dissolution with carbonic acid ii of the vegetation assisted by a cumulative fractionation of 13 4 it is commonly observed in case studies with dominant c3 type of vegetation that a depleted 13c signature typifies silicate weathering whereas carbonate weathering by comparatively enriched 13c signature of the dic interpretation of the origin of δ13cdic values in groundwater can differ when there is a component of c4 vegetation in the overlying soil δ13c in soil carbonates and c3 c4 vegetation from two sedimentary profiles close to our study area in the gujarat alluvial plains have been studied in a very recent article basu et al 2018 and can be taken as the best representative one for better constraining the δ13c of various end members compared to using assumed values the δ13c soil carbonates analyzed by basu et al 2018 were found to vary between 0 to 8 8 average 3 6 2 3 while the corresponding values reported for c3 plants are 27 to 31 4 average 28 9 1 1 and the average reported for δ13c of c4 plants is 12 5 1 3 the δ13cdic in our groundwater samples has been modelled by considering i the various pathways by which δ13c is generated using the above end member values ii the processes by which it is moderated during its residence time as groundwater and iii assuming that the decomposition rates of c3 and c4 plant organic matter to produce soil co2 are similar thus δ13cof the soil co2 would depend on their relative biomass exposure and not on the complexities in their composition from the simple two end member mixing model the fraction of dic derived from carbonic acid mediated carbonate weathering f carb and from silicate weathering f sil for each groundwater sample gw are estimated from the equation below δ 13 c m i x g w f s i l δ 13 c s i l f c a r b δ 13 c c a r b f s i l f c a r b 1 two cases are considered i where the soil co2 is assumed to be solely derived from c3 plants ii soil co2 is derived from 90 c3 to 10 c4 plants it can be observed that silicate weathering with soil co2 derived from 100 c3 will result in δ13cdic of 15 5 while carbonate weathering will be 9 7 for the second case the corresponding values will be 13 9 and 8 9 it is to be noted that the most enriched 13cvalue in groundwater is observed for sample mb 9 with a δ13c value of 7 4 which is the same within the uncertainties in calculating δ13c of the carbonate end members say 8 9 and 9 7 therefore the carbonate end member value is revised to 7 4 the calculated values of fcar when the soil co2 is derived only from c3 plants case i vary from 35 to 100 with an average of 75 1σ 16 n 37 indicating that weathering of carbonates is the dominant process that supplies dic to the groundwater for case ii with a marginal contribution of c4 plants to the soil co2 the range and the average of fcar decrease to 19 100 and 69 1σ 20 n 37 respectively expectedly the least fcar value is observed for the four samples with depleted 13c signature wherein silicate weathering accounts for most of the dic in the range of 55 70 mvj 3 60 73 mvd 2 65 80 mb 3 and almost all dic for the sample mkd 9 δ13cdic released from the weathering process can be modified slightly by calcite precipitation in aquifer environments and many of the samples have a calcite saturation index csi 1 calcite precipitation will enrich the precipitated carbonate in 13c by about 1 8 faure 1986 no apparent correlation was observed from the δ13c csi plot fig s1 of the groundwater samples many of the samples have similar δ13c though their csi values differ by one unit hence a clear linkage between them was not discernible in reducing groundwater environments fermentation of organic matter followed by methane generation can produce co2 with enriched 13c the role of methanogenesis is typically identified by enriched 13c values in residual water δ13c 10 clark and fritz 1997 which is also not evident from our groundwater data alternatively methane oxidation will produce co2 with a depleted 13c signature resulting in low δ13c values of 30 which also has not been observed in our samples therefore the role of the above processes which can potentially affect the initial weathering signal of δ13cdic appears to be nominal in our samples 5 4 inverse modelling for source apportionment as discussed above the groundwater chemistry of this region is mainly regulated by solute supply through four major sources rain salt affected soils and weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals we have used an inversion approach involving chemical datasets to apportion relative contributions from these sources the inverse model used in this study is similar to that used by tripathy and das 2014 which has been successfully employed earlier for source apportionment of the river tripathy and singh 2010 and coastal waters danish et al 2020 details of this model are part of our earlier publications tripathy and das 2014 briefly the inversion model follows a non linear optimization algorithm to find best fit that can explain the data and model parameters here the data parameters are the measured compositions of the groundwater samples whereas the model parameters are the composition of and relative contributions from major sources the iterative algorithm starts from a set of a priori values for model parameters to find corresponding a posteriori values that can explain the mass balance equation between data and model parameters with least residual we have used average a priori compositions for the major sources rain chatterjee and singh 2012 silicates gaillardet et al 1999 carbonates moon et al 2007 and salt affected soils rengarajan et al 2009 in the model by compiling literature information results from the inverse modelling show that the average solute contributions are different for the possible major sources such as rain 31 13 silicate 23 12 carbonate 15 13 and salt affected soils 30 22 fig 6 depicts that the solute loads of these groundwater samples from the semi arid region in addition to rock dissolution and atmospheric supply are regulated by the dissolution of the salt affected soils the contribution of salt affected soils draws support from δ13c alkalinity ca2 mg2 plot fig 7 one of the samples with a high value of alkalinity ca2 mg2 ratio greater than 80 is excluded from the plot congruent weathering of silicates and or carbonates mediated by h2co3 would yield a maximum alkalinity ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 therefore higher values of alkalinity ca2 mg2 most likely point towards an alkaline salt affected soil end member in the plot about 80 of the samples have an alkalinity ca2 mg2 ratio greater than 2 and a median value of 3 82 lend additional support that high values of the ratio in our dataset point towards na associated alkalinity this observation is in clear contrast to that expected in tropical aquatic systems which are often found to be dominated by carbonate dissolution tripathy and singh 2010 however a few studies from peninsular india exist that document appreciable solute supply from saline alkaline soils rengarajan et al 2009 rai et al 2010 das et al 2011 in arid to semi arid regions these sodium rich soils form through excessive evaporation of rivers floods and groundwater through capillary actions during the lean phases these soils mainly composed of na cl hco3 and so4 2 are characterized by fast dissolution kinetics the high abundance of these soils in semi arid regions and their rapid dissolution during wet phases can explain the observed higher solute contribution from the salt affected soils fig 6 this additional solute source is responsible for groundwater chemistry of na cl hco3 type in semi arid regions which is distinctly different from typical ca mg hco3 chemistry for groundwater the na rich composition of semi arid groundwater may have a distinct effect on human health and agricultural activities na rich groundwater increases the blood pressure level in the body which can result in cardiac arrest blaustein et al 2012 high na has an adverse effect on agricultural activity it reduces water availability due to the formation of salts which affects the yield it also reduces the water infiltration rate reducing crop yield and quality hussain et al 2019 6 conclusion and future perspectives previously we reported high fluoride from a semi arid region in western india the region is known to have the occurrence of soil salts however their impact on groundwater chemistry was not investigated in earlier studies as a part of our extensive geochemical investigation of the groundwater of the same region here we investigated the major ions and δd δ18o and δ13cdic of seventy two groundwater samples the objectives are to quantify the solute sources and intensity of water rock interaction by using major ions data and their inverse modelling trace groundwater origin from the water isotope data and identify sources of dic and the sub surface weathering processes from δ13cdic and major ion data in these semi arid aquifers major ions data for these samples from a semi arid region show a significant solute supply from salt affected soils in the basin in addition to atmospheric deposition and bedrock weathering the dominancy of na k and cl in these samples also confirms the leaching of these soils with faster dissolution kinetics the δ13cdic of these samples varies between 7 4 and 16 4 comparison of these isotopic data with their possible sources indicates a supply of dissolved inorganic carbon via weathering of bedrocks and leaching of salt affected soils mass balance calculations of the major ions dataset using an inversion approach estimate that on average about one third of the solute load of the groundwater samples is supplied through the salt affected soils the relative contributions from rock dissolution such as silicate 23 12 and carbonate 15 13 weathering are significantly lower than that of the saline soils the dominancy of salt affected soils in regulating groundwater chemistry is mainly linked to high evaporation in these arid regions these samples also yield a lower slope 5 2 for the δd δ18o regression line than that of the gmwl line 8 supporting the significant impact of evaporation on the hydrology of this region future directions of research on groundwater of the region may include using cl and br isotopes δ37cl and δ81br to understand better the origin of salinity nitrogen δ15n and lithium δ7li isotopes to understand the influence of anthropogenic inputs in groundwater and 87sr 86sr to pinpoint the silicate versus carbonate weathering processes better in addition to chemical and isotopic tools the use of multivariate statistical analyses like principal component analysis factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to understand the dynamics of groundwater salinization techniques like predictive modelling and simulation which include machine learning and inverse modelling can serve as reliable tools the future of groundwater science is possibly lies in providing statistically optimal predictions with maximal precision especially when point measurements are sparse therefore statistical and machine learning techniques should be used to create salinity maps and address the proper management and

11689,detailed geochemical and stable isotopic δdh2o δ18oh2o and δ13cdic study of groundwater samples n 74 from a semi arid region in western india was carried out to constrain their solute sources and sub surface weathering processes na cl and hco3 dominate major ion chemistry this type of chemistry points to a significant solute supply from the salt affected soils and bedrock dissolution the average δ18o and δd in our groundwater samples are similar to their corresponding values in precipitation samples spatial variability of the δ18o and δd data depicts the impact of continental effect and variable extent of evaporation in this region the δ18o δd cross plot yields a lower slope 5 2 0 5 than that of the global meteoric water line 8 confirming the significant impact of evaporation on groundwater hydrology δ13cdic values vary between 7 3 and 16 4 average 9 7 1 7 and first order binary mixing calculation shows that about 75 16 of the dic in these samples are supplied via carbonate dissolution range 35 100 inverse model calculations involving elemental ratios of major ions show that the solutes are mainly supplied through salt affected soils 30 22 with sub ordinate contributions from rain 31 13 silicate 23 12 and carbonate 15 13 these estimates are consistent with the formation of salt affected soils via evaporative water loss in semi arid regions and the faster dissolution kinetics of these soil salts the outcomes of this study underscore distinctly different compositions of semi arid groundwater reservoirs which has implications for drinking and irrigation usage graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater stable isotopes geochemistry weathering inverse modelling salt affected soils data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the predominant water resource for domestic and agricultural needs particularly in arid and semi arid regions with limited surface water availability in these regions the groundwater recharge rate is lower than its withdrawal rate moridi et al 2018 resulting in the depletion of the water table and drying up of aquifers in longer timescales van der kamp and hayashi 1998 in india groundwater withdrawals are more than 25 of global withdrawals shen et al 2008 mukherjee and singh 2018 more than 60 of irrigated agriculture and 85 of drinking water supplies in rural regions of india depend on groundwater resources world bank report 2010 identifying the sources and origin of groundwater and understanding geochemical processes regulating groundwater quality are of fundamental importance for the sustainable management of this resource in these regions in this regard chemical and isotopic studies of groundwater are primarily useful in assessing hydrological aspects e g recharge and groundwater flow groundwater quality solute sources and factors regulating their chemistry e g catchment rock type aquifer type land use land cover and water rock interaction clark and fritz 1997 edmunds and shand 2009 herczeg and leaney 2011 these fundamental hydrochemical investigations provide valuable insights and have motivated researchers to work on groundwater treatment and modelling to find novel effective and cost effective solutions to groundwater contamination goswami and kumar 2018 siddique et al 2020 high f in groundwaters has been reported in different countries and india ali et al 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 mandal et al 2021 in the western parts of india high f were reported from the states of rajasthan and gujarat hussain et al 2010 datta et al 1999 previously we reported high fluoride levels in a semi arid region in western india mandal et al 2021 and evaluated the non carcinogenic risk to the region s local population in this study we present the major ion chemistry and stable isotopic composition of groundwater samples from the same region to infer their solute sources and sub surface weathering processes the groundwater resource from these regions has often been linked to two societal issues lowering the groundwater table and groundwater contamination e g salinity fluoride and nitrate consistently we reported the extent of potential health risks to the 2 3 million local population because of the high fluoride in these reservoirs mandal et al 2021 additionally this region has been reported to have large exposure to saline alkaline sodic non calcic soils dhiman and keshari 2006 however the role of leaching of these salt affected soils with fast dissolution kinetics on groundwater chemistry has received limited attention recently khatri et al 2020 investigated the groundwater water quality index in a small pocket nine villages in the satlasana sub district mehsana from the aquifer mentioned above however available studies from this region dhiman and keshari 2006 khatri et al 2020 have not attempted in great detail about the sources and origin of solutes in these regional aquifers with depleting water tables bradley and phadtare 1989 karunakalage et al 2021 this study aims to i quantify the solute sources and intensity of water rock interaction in these semi arid aquifers from western india by using major ions data and their inverse modelling ii trace groundwater origin from the water isotope data δ18o and δd and identify the role of evaporation in altering isotopic signatures and iii identify sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic from stable carbon isotopes of dic δ13cdic and delineate silicate versus carbonate weathering processes this comprehensive study provides baseline chemical and hitherto unavailable isotopic data on regional groundwater in turn this can help validate groundwater quality models and provide a detailed scientific understanding of groundwater geochemistry required for the sustainable management of this resource 2 study area this study is part of our ongoing research on groundwater geochemistry in western india mandal et al 2021 the present study has mainly been conducted in a hot and arid region mehsana district gujarat covering an area of 4371 km2 fig 1 the monthly rainfall around this region at deesa varies between 0 1 mm april and 216 mm july with an annual rainfall of 580 mm cgwb report 2014 the southwest monsoon season june july august and september accounts for 80 of the annual rainfall the temperature of this area ranges from 10 c to 41 c the air humidity is low 35 during march and high 77 during august the evapotranspiration rates vary between 3 3 and 8 2 mm day 1 cgwb report 2014 kulkarni 1985 and phadtare 1981 reported the geology of this area briefly this area is mainly composed of quaternary alluvium with sub ordinate exposures of meta sediments sandstone and conglomerate and clay deposits further salt affected soils have also been reported in this region chinchmalatpure 2017 the salinity and sodicity of these soils are mainly linked to solute supply by continental weathering delivery of oceanic salts na cl by wind and rainfall and the capillary rise of ions from sub soil salt beds and excessive use of water for irrigation choudhary and kharche 2018 exposures of calcareous sandy loamy and non calcic red brown soils are also reported in the region dhiman and keshari 2006 cgwb 2014 groundwater occurs under phreatic and confined conditions while its development depends on aquifer geometry and yield characteristics cgwb 2014 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the study area s north eastern part primarily composed of metasediments and intrusive is through secondary porosity the typical depth 22 m 610 m and discharge 180 2496 l min 1 of the groundwater in this region have been reported by central groundwater board cgwb 2014 the depth of these groundwaters shows strong seasonality with 68 of the wells showing a rise in the water table of 0 32 m 9 46 m during the monsoon season cgwb 2014 the sub surface aquifer of this region is mainly comprised of precambrian hard rocks semi consolidated mesozoic and tertiary formations and unconsolidated quaternary alluvial deposits a major part of the study area is underlain by miocene alluvium and older sedimentary systems consisting of coarse sand gravel kankar silt clay and clay stones 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analyses sampling details of the groundwater samples from the western indian region n 74 are included in an earlier study mandal et al 2021 briefly these samples were collected from hand pump bore wells and dug wells during two field campaigns conducted in 2015 and 2019 fig 1 for alkalinity and major ions samples were collected and stored in 125 ml hdpe bottles stable carbon isotopes δ13cdic in 60 ml amber colored glass bottles and water isotopes in 60 ml hdpe bottles the samples were collected and stored until analysis following standard protocols clark and fritz 1997 water ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds of the samples were analyzed in the field using the potable meter eutech pcd 650 concentrations of the alkalinity were measured by titration method using an auto titrator metrohm instrument measurements of major cations ca2 mg2 k na and anions so4 2 no3 cl f were done in filtered samples by ion chromatography thermofisher scientific with a precision better than 5 stable oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotopic compositions of the samples were measured using the isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus using the co2 h2 equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 the precision and accuracy of the analyses were continuously monitored by using multiple aliquots of secondary laboratory standards iwin i δ18o 6 5 δd 39 8 iwin ii δ18o 11 01 δd 73 96 and iwin iii δ18o 15 07 δd 36 8 with respect to the vsmow prepared under a national programme on isotope fingerprinting of waters of india iwin deshpande and gupta 2012 the precisions for δ18o and δd measurements were better than 0 1 and 1 respectively the carbon isotopic δ13cdic analyses in the dissolved inorganic fractions of selected samples collected during 2019 were carried out before analyses these samples were poisoned with mercury chloride to eliminate bacterial growth stored in amber bottles sealed with a rubber septum and aluminum cap to avoid any gaseous exchange and wrapped with black paper to avoid direct contact with sunlight to avoid any bacterial growth the samples were kept in an ice box during field campaigns and preserved at 3 c during laboratory storage until analysis the δ13cdic of the samples was measured following established protocols bhavya et al 2017 briefly the samples were treated with ortho phosphoric acid and isotopes of the extracted co2 were measured using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 attached to a gas bench the analytical precision of δ13cdic for replicate standards was better than 0 1 sodium carbonate salt δ13c 11 4 0 1 calibrated against the nbs standard was used as an internal laboratory standard 3 2 inverse modelling of groundwater chemistry data in this study we have adopted an inverse modelling approach involving chemical data of groundwater samples and their possible major sources e g rain salt affected soils and weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals to apportion relative solute contributions from these sources the model used here is similar to that used by tripathy and das 2014 which has been successfully employed earlier for source apportionment of rivers tripathy and singh 2010 and coastal waters danish et al 2020 details of this model are part of our earlier publications tripathy and das 2014 briefly the inversion model follows a non linear optimization algorithm to find best fit that can explain the data and model parameters here the data parameters cl na ca na mg na and hco3 na are the measured compositions of the groundwater samples in contrast the model parameters are the composition of and relative contributions from four major sources the following mass balance equations relate the data and model parameters 1 c l n a i 1 4 c l n a i f i 2 c a n a i 1 4 c a n a i f i 3 m g n a i 1 4 m g n a i f i 4 h c o 3 n a i 1 4 h c o 3 n a i f i 5 1 i 1 4 f i where i 1 2 3 and 4 stand for the four major sources the term f i represents the relative supply of sodium from source i we have used na normalized ratios to avoid chemical changes due to water dilution and limited sodium sources in the watershed further we have excluded selected elements e g k no3 so4 2 due to their multiple sources including both natural and anthropogenic sources with limited chemical data the iterative algorithm starts from a set of a priori values for model parameters to find corresponding a posteriori values that can explain the mass balance equation between data and model parameters with the least residual we have used average a priori compositions for the major sources of rain chatterjee and singh 2012 silicates gaillardet et al 1999 carbonates moon et al 2007 and salt affected soils rengarajan et al 2009 in the model by compiling literature information this model yields a posteriori parameters with uncertainties including the relative fraction of solutes from each source 4 results chemical and stable isotopic data of the groundwater samples have been included in table 1 the fluoride content of these samples is from one of our earlier works mandal et al 2021 table 1 which focused on fluoride risk assessment and its geochemistry the piper plot fig 2 showed that the groundwater chemistry of our samples is mainly na cl hco3 type detailed analysis revealed that 50 of the samples fall in na cl dominated zone 15 in the na hco3 zone and 24 in the mixed type while only 5 fell in the ca cl and mg hco3 type zones grossly the trend is somewhat similar to the observation made by raychowdhury et al 2014 in the chaco pampean plain argentina this is however in contrast to the groundwater data of kumar et al 2018 from the ganga yamuna plain and mukherjee et al 2009 from the west bengal basin for example kumar et al 2018 reported 15 52 and 33 of the samples belonged to mg hco3 ca hco3 and na hco3 types respectively on average na k and ca2 mg2 account for 73 and 27 of the cationic charges tz μeq l respectively while the corresponding median values are 76 and 24 this indicates the dominance of alkali cations over alkaline earth cations to the overall charges likewise cl and hco3 dominate the anion charge tz μeq l followed by so4 2 with respective contributions of 41 45 and 9 the dissolved na content of these samples varies from 1521 to 45 352 μm with an average concentration of 14 400 8856 μm n 74 these na concentrations are about 60 times higher than the global average for rivers 240 μm however the average ca2 concentrations of these groundwater samples 975 864 μm n 74 are only 3 times higher than the global riverine ca2 concentrations the dominant anions in these samples are cl and hco3 which account for 45 and 42 of the total anionic content tz respectively average chloride concentrations 10 797 9081 μm are also two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for the local rainwater 30 μm and global rivers 167 μm meybeck and drever 2003 the alkalinity of these samples varies between 2000 and 17 633 μm with an average concentration of 7228 2947 μm these groundwater samples also have appreciable nitrate content 634 602 μm which accounts for 5 of the tz the saturation index with respect to calcite csi and dolomite dsi was calculated using the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 to know the thermodynamic tendency of these minerals to precipitate out from the groundwater calculations show that 55 and 85 of the samples are oversaturated with calcite 0 01 0 82 and dolomite 0 02 5 32 respectively in about 55 of the samples which are oversaturated with both calcite and dolomite the csi dsi ratios range from 0 04 to 4 5 with an average of 0 48 and median of 0 31 lower csi dsi values were observed in groundwater collected from the huhhot basin inner mogolia however relatively higher values were observed in the west bengal basin groundwaters mukherjee et al 2009 the δ18o and δd values range from 4 8 to 1 9 and from 35 to 17 respectively these values compare to the δ18o range of 3 7 to 21 5 and δd range of 30 to 92 reported for precipitation at a nearby site ahmedabad deshpande et al 2010 the average δ18o and δd values of our groundwater samples 3 5 0 6 and 23 9 3 8 respectively are similar to their corresponding amount weighted average values of 3 9 and 23 in precipitation samples collected during 2005 2008 deshpande et al 2010 our groundwater values compare to the range of δ18o 1 5 to 6 1 and δd 18 to 46 in groundwaters from kachchh district gujarat maurya et al 2019 δ18o 2 39 to 11 3 and δd 12 5 to 76 9 for the state of punjab krishan et al 2021 δ18o 3 3 to 8 7 and δd 37 to 60 for the ganga yamuna alluvium plain in northern india kumar et al 2018 and δ18o 0 5 to 6 1 and δd 15 to 43 in as rich groundwaters of the west bengal basin mukherjee et al 2009 the δ13cdic in our samples has a relatively narrow range 7 4 to 10 8 n 34 fig 3 except for four samples which vary between 11 9 to 16 4 the average δ13cdic when all samples considered is 9 6 1 7 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater origin understanding groundwater origin is critical to studies on groundwater resource management and groundwater contamination clark and fritz 1997 groundwater typically integrates the water isotope signals over its residence times a few years to decades or even higher and averages out minor major variations in individual isotope signals complexities in the hydrological processes operating in the atmosphere and groundwater environments e g advection mixing of vapour masses evaporation condensation mixing and dispersion can moderate the water isotope composition for individual precipitation events despite of similarity in the δ18o values between groundwater and precipitation on a relatively large scale district level the entire study area we observe a notable spatial variability between groundwater at the sub district level a gradual depletion in 18o was observed along the southwest to north east direction for the topmost four sub districts i e becharaji unjha kheralu and satlasana with δ18o values of 2 9 0 4 3 4 0 2 4 1 0 5 and 4 4 0 2 respectively a similar decrease in δ18o as a function of distance was reported for the first time in groundwater from western india by bhattacharya et al 1985 the above indicates the effect of infiltration of locally derived precipitation through the soil layers regulating the water isotope signature of the groundwater the decrease in δ18o of 1 5 observed between the averages of samples collected from becharaji 2 9 0 4 and satlasana 4 4 0 2 sub districts along a stretch of 100 km can intuitively be attributed to two possible reasons i response of the continental effect that might be occurring to the average precipitation at those places a progressive depletion in 18o as a function of distance is explained as the moisture front moves away from the coast the remaining vapour becomes progressively depleted with each rainout in the heavier isotope precipitation in the western part of india is dominated by and large by the southwest monsoon where the vapours originate from the arabian sea south southwest and travel along a north northeast direction ii evaporation of an h2o molecule taking place in the soil zone during its transit as a part of rainfall to a part of the groundwater the dxs values for becharaji unjha kheralu and satlasana are 3 5 1 3 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 and 7 3 0 8 respectively the lower dxs value see later discussion of the becharaji samples compared to the satlasana signifies more evaporation taking in the former groundwater samples however the average dxs values for the unjha and kheralu samples are similar to that of the becharaji samples indicating that the evaporation effect cannot be discerned at a lesser spatial scale from the dxs proxy therefore we conclude that both the above processes i e the continental effect and the evaporation effect might be responsible for the decrease in δ18o of 1 5 between the becharaji and satlasana groundwater samples δ18o δd cross plot fig 4 provides insight into the hydrological pathways as fractionation of the water isotopes behave in a predictable i e mass dependent way δ18o δd in precipitation from the humid and temperate regions of the world follow a linear regression δd 8 δ18o 10 known by global meteoric water line craig 1961 later refined by rozanski et al 1993 the slope of 8 represents the in cloud equilibrium fractionation process strongly dependent on temperature and the intercept of 10 the kinetic fractionation strongly dependent on humidity between ocean water and the vapour formed similarly regional precipitations follow a linear regression known by the local meteoric water line lmwl for our study the lmwl δd 7 7 δ18o 7 2 was taken from the extensive n 120 data set on water isotope in ahmedabad precipitation deshpande et al 2010 similarly the parameter d excess dxs δd 8 δ18o used to quantify the relative magnitude of kinetic fractionation is discussed in conjunction with water isotope data with progressive evaporation the residual water enriches itself in the heavier isotopes 18o and 2h however the relative enrichment of 18o being more than 2h results in dxs values less than 10 in the residual phase undergoing evaporation in a δ18o δd plot fig 4 95 of our groundwater samples fall below the gmwl suggestive of evaporation which shifts the δ18o δd signatures to positions below the gmwl four samples mm 8 mm 9 mm 10 and mvd 1 lie above the gmwl and have dxs values of 12 9 14 9 12 5 and 10 4 respectively these indicate that these four samples originated from rainfall s having a re evaporated component of moisture generally attributed to samples above gmwl two of the samples mu 1 and mvj 2 have negative dxs values of 2 5 and 5 5 except for these six samples the remaining samples have an average dxs value of 4 0 1 5 range 0 3 to 7 9 the spread in their dxs values can be explained simply by the evaporation of the meteoric signal to differential extents when all samples are considered in the δ18o δd an even lower slope of 5 2 was observed which is typical of evaporation in samples under low humidity conditions and the samples deviate from the gmwl a similar conclusion of extensive evaporation supported by lower slopes of 4 6 has been reported for groundwater samples gibson et al 1993 saka et al 2013 kumar et al 2018 for example in the indian context lower slopes of 4 81 δd 4 81 δ18o 19 2 and 5 02 δd 5 02 δ18o 17 53 were reported in shallow and middle depth groundwater samples collected from the ganga yamuna alluvial plain in northern india kumar et al 2018 these slopes are lower than the slope of 7 2 reported for the respective lmwl new delhi in addition to evaluating evaporative enrichment in groundwater from their δ18o and δ2h data recently the coupled use of water stable isotope and tritium 3h data was used in delineating the sources of recharge water krishan et al 2021 in groundwater collected from the state of punjab interestingly it was inferred that canal water is the important recharge source while evaporative enrichment is primarily responsible for increasing salinity hazard for shallow groundwater collected from the south west parts of the state krishan et al 2021 5 2 sources of solutes analyses correlation plots correlation matrix and elemental ratios of groundwater solute data provide preliminary clues to their sources and processes occurring in the sub surface aquifer environment table 2 represents the correlation matrix of hydrochemical parameters na and cl two out of the three dominant ions in the sampled groundwater exhibit a good correlation r2 0 78 n 74 suggestive of their common sources in the form of evaporites recycled salts and saline and sodic soils which all have been reported to exist in upper soils from the mehsana district dhiman and keshari 2006 interestingly na mg2 shows a linear relationship with cl so4 2 r2 0 8 fig 5 a with a slope of 0 88 and a large positive intercept of 5 7 me the slope suggests that na mg2 can account for 90 of the cl so4 2 this confirms the contribution of saline sodic alkaline salts of na and mg2 for most samples na cl equivalent ratios in the samples vary from 0 71 to 4 53 with an average of 1 69 σ 0 81 table s1 eleven of the total samples 15 show cl excess hereafter referred to as clxs i e na cl while the rest of them with na cl are termed as na excess naxs samples the chemistry data of the clxs samples indicate additional cl sources not supported by na as the counter ion the most likely reason for clxs samples in our sample set is the dissolution of mg2 salts of chlorides and sulfates present in soils interestingly these eleven samples exhibit a good correlation between the pairs of na cl r2 0 94 na so4 2 r2 0 62 mg2 cl r2 0 76 mg2 so4 2 r2 0 63 table s2 these are supported further by a linear relationship between na mg2 and cl so4 2 slope of 0 88 intercept 1594 μe r2 0 97 fig s2 and is typical characteristics of leaching of sodic saline alkaline salts present in soils to the groundwater in surface waters clxs is usually attributed to an anthropogenic origin mainly emanating from acid industry discharges and are unlikely to be the cause in our study area which is primarily rural about 85 of the samples exhibit na cl values 1 00 up to 4 53 this range of na cl variation in the sample set can be explained by increased contribution of na the decreased contribution of cl or a combination of both na cl 1 0 in surface or groundwater usually is interpreted as na to be derived from na silicates clark and fritz 1997 the role of silicate and carbonates in groundwater chemistry is conventionally inferred from the ca2 mg2 hco3 fig 5b equivalent plot if these alkali earth cations are predominantly derived from carbonic acid h2co3 mediated weathering of carbonates and or silicates and assuming congruent dissolution of silicates the data points all would fall in and around the 1 1 line most of the samples fall much below the 1 1 line signifying that hco3 is added to the groundwater at proportions higher than ca2 and mg2 a closer look into the plot reveals that one major group of samples lies between 1 1 and 1 2 lines and another between 1 2 and 1 10 lines hco3 excess therefore these observations require other cation s to balance the excess hco3 charge na being the most likely and dominant one in fact na na minus cl shows a moderate positive correlation r2 0 49 slope 0 64 y mx type of line against hco3 which hints towards their na and hco3 release by a common process or has a common source s a lower limit of hco3 associated with non calcitic dolomitic sources i e silicates or soil na salt sources such as na2co3 and nahco3 was estimated assuming all ca2 and mg2 is due to carbonate weathering and was subtracted from the total hco3 hco3non carbonate hco3total ca mg it is interesting to note that for the naxs samples na shows a very good correlation r2 0 8 y mx type of line against hco3non carbonate with a slope of 0 90 suggesting that hco3 that is not supported for by ca2 plus mg2 can account for 90 of the na that is not supported for by cl this has been interpreted to result from a combination of two pathways i weathering of albite which releases na and hco3 in equal proportions the presence of albite in soils from the mehsana district was confirmed by xrd dhiman and keshari 2006 and ii leaching weathering of alkaline soils can also release na and hco3 in equal proportions repeated cycles of wetting and evaporation in the soil zones of semi arid to arid regions are known to result in the formation of alkaline soils enriched in na2co3 sarin et al 1989 smedley et al 2003 shi 2004 mukherjee et al 2009 which can supply na and hco3 to shallow groundwater relative dominance of the two above processes in their contribution to na and hco3 is difficult to ascertain from the present major ion data however the observation that 90 of the high f samples 1 5 mg l 1 fall between the zone of 1 1 and 1 10 lines in the ca2 mg2 hco3 plot suggest that silicate weathering is also an important process for those samples silicates are known to be the major source of f in the region kulkarni 1985 dhiman and keshari 2006 furthermore support for the above mechanism to be operating in the aquifer environment was concluded from both the slope of 0 78 and a positive intercept of 1892 μe of the linear fit r2 0 79 between na cl so4 2 against hco3 non carbonate fig 5c the above is under the assumption that all so4 2 in groundwater is associated only with na e g as na2so4 and its contribution has been deducted from na assuming an equal association of sulfate to na and mg2 the respective slope and intercept values would change to 0 74 and 2517 μe in a linear fit r2 0 76 of na cl 0 5so4 against hco3 ca 0 5 mg summarizing the above discussions the role of saline alkaline sodic soils in contributing to na and mg2 with cl and so4 2 as the counter ions are evident ca is mainly derived from carbonates while the latter s role in mg contribution is comparatively less hco3 is contributed mainly by carbonates of na and alkaline earth cations with a subordinate contribution from the silicate weathering more in the next section which also supplies dissolved na to the groundwater 5 3 silicate versus carbonate weathering in groundwater environments inorganic and organic carbon forms play fundamental roles in weathering reactions the carbon cycle and the geochemical evolution of groundwater both stable and radioisotopes of carbon 13c and 14c have been used to trace the carbon cycle in groundwater clark and fritz 1997 in this study we have used isotopic ratio δ13cdic to infer the sources of carbon in groundwater and on the mechanistic pathways by which the δ13cdic has been accrued the δ13cdic in groundwater primarily depends on the weathering pathway e g silicate and or carbonate and the acid type e g carbonic and sulfuric involved in the weathering reactions isotopic composition of various dic sources their relative contributions to the dic concentration and the accompanied carbon isotope fractionations both equilibrium and kinetic during the transfer of carbon from one phase to another soil organic matter co2 g hco3 ultimately decide the δ13cdic in groundwater dic sources include carbonate minerals and soil co2 derived from soil organic matter decomposition weathering of silicates also contributes to groundwater dic which is also sourced from the soil co2 the initial δ13csoil co2 depends on the vegetation type with c3 and c4 having contrasting δ13c average values clark and fritz 1997 with partial pressures of soil co2 several times higher than the atmospheric pco2 diffusion of the soil co2 to the atmosphere occurs it is assisted by a kinetic fractionation of 4 4 leaving the residual soil co2 enriched in the heavier isotopes further transformation of soil co2 to hco3 involves a temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation of 9 at 20 c while enriching the hco3 phase in 13c therefore dic produced exclusively by silicate weathering with the underlying assumption that silicates do not contain any form of calcites and are mediated by carbonic acid will have δ13cdic higher by 13 4 compared to that of the vegetation in the case of carbonate weathering mediated by carbonic acid the δ13cdic will also depend on the δ13c of carbonates weathering of carbonates produces dic where half mole mole of it is derived from carbonate minerals and the remaining half from soil co2 thus δ13cdic derived from carbonate weathering will be the arithmetic mean of two δ13cs i of the carbonates with no fractionation involved in carbonate dissolution with carbonic acid ii of the vegetation assisted by a cumulative fractionation of 13 4 it is commonly observed in case studies with dominant c3 type of vegetation that a depleted 13c signature typifies silicate weathering whereas carbonate weathering by comparatively enriched 13c signature of the dic interpretation of the origin of δ13cdic values in groundwater can differ when there is a component of c4 vegetation in the overlying soil δ13c in soil carbonates and c3 c4 vegetation from two sedimentary profiles close to our study area in the gujarat alluvial plains have been studied in a very recent article basu et al 2018 and can be taken as the best representative one for better constraining the δ13c of various end members compared to using assumed values the δ13c soil carbonates analyzed by basu et al 2018 were found to vary between 0 to 8 8 average 3 6 2 3 while the corresponding values reported for c3 plants are 27 to 31 4 average 28 9 1 1 and the average reported for δ13c of c4 plants is 12 5 1 3 the δ13cdic in our groundwater samples has been modelled by considering i the various pathways by which δ13c is generated using the above end member values ii the processes by which it is moderated during its residence time as groundwater and iii assuming that the decomposition rates of c3 and c4 plant organic matter to produce soil co2 are similar thus δ13cof the soil co2 would depend on their relative biomass exposure and not on the complexities in their composition from the simple two end member mixing model the fraction of dic derived from carbonic acid mediated carbonate weathering f carb and from silicate weathering f sil for each groundwater sample gw are estimated from the equation below δ 13 c m i x g w f s i l δ 13 c s i l f c a r b δ 13 c c a r b f s i l f c a r b 1 two cases are considered i where the soil co2 is assumed to be solely derived from c3 plants ii soil co2 is derived from 90 c3 to 10 c4 plants it can be observed that silicate weathering with soil co2 derived from 100 c3 will result in δ13cdic of 15 5 while carbonate weathering will be 9 7 for the second case the corresponding values will be 13 9 and 8 9 it is to be noted that the most enriched 13cvalue in groundwater is observed for sample mb 9 with a δ13c value of 7 4 which is the same within the uncertainties in calculating δ13c of the carbonate end members say 8 9 and 9 7 therefore the carbonate end member value is revised to 7 4 the calculated values of fcar when the soil co2 is derived only from c3 plants case i vary from 35 to 100 with an average of 75 1σ 16 n 37 indicating that weathering of carbonates is the dominant process that supplies dic to the groundwater for case ii with a marginal contribution of c4 plants to the soil co2 the range and the average of fcar decrease to 19 100 and 69 1σ 20 n 37 respectively expectedly the least fcar value is observed for the four samples with depleted 13c signature wherein silicate weathering accounts for most of the dic in the range of 55 70 mvj 3 60 73 mvd 2 65 80 mb 3 and almost all dic for the sample mkd 9 δ13cdic released from the weathering process can be modified slightly by calcite precipitation in aquifer environments and many of the samples have a calcite saturation index csi 1 calcite precipitation will enrich the precipitated carbonate in 13c by about 1 8 faure 1986 no apparent correlation was observed from the δ13c csi plot fig s1 of the groundwater samples many of the samples have similar δ13c though their csi values differ by one unit hence a clear linkage between them was not discernible in reducing groundwater environments fermentation of organic matter followed by methane generation can produce co2 with enriched 13c the role of methanogenesis is typically identified by enriched 13c values in residual water δ13c 10 clark and fritz 1997 which is also not evident from our groundwater data alternatively methane oxidation will produce co2 with a depleted 13c signature resulting in low δ13c values of 30 which also has not been observed in our samples therefore the role of the above processes which can potentially affect the initial weathering signal of δ13cdic appears to be nominal in our samples 5 4 inverse modelling for source apportionment as discussed above the groundwater chemistry of this region is mainly regulated by solute supply through four major sources rain salt affected soils and weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals we have used an inversion approach involving chemical datasets to apportion relative contributions from these sources the inverse model used in this study is similar to that used by tripathy and das 2014 which has been successfully employed earlier for source apportionment of the river tripathy and singh 2010 and coastal waters danish et al 2020 details of this model are part of our earlier publications tripathy and das 2014 briefly the inversion model follows a non linear optimization algorithm to find best fit that can explain the data and model parameters here the data parameters are the measured compositions of the groundwater samples whereas the model parameters are the composition of and relative contributions from major sources the iterative algorithm starts from a set of a priori values for model parameters to find corresponding a posteriori values that can explain the mass balance equation between data and model parameters with least residual we have used average a priori compositions for the major sources rain chatterjee and singh 2012 silicates gaillardet et al 1999 carbonates moon et al 2007 and salt affected soils rengarajan et al 2009 in the model by compiling literature information results from the inverse modelling show that the average solute contributions are different for the possible major sources such as rain 31 13 silicate 23 12 carbonate 15 13 and salt affected soils 30 22 fig 6 depicts that the solute loads of these groundwater samples from the semi arid region in addition to rock dissolution and atmospheric supply are regulated by the dissolution of the salt affected soils the contribution of salt affected soils draws support from δ13c alkalinity ca2 mg2 plot fig 7 one of the samples with a high value of alkalinity ca2 mg2 ratio greater than 80 is excluded from the plot congruent weathering of silicates and or carbonates mediated by h2co3 would yield a maximum alkalinity ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 therefore higher values of alkalinity ca2 mg2 most likely point towards an alkaline salt affected soil end member in the plot about 80 of the samples have an alkalinity ca2 mg2 ratio greater than 2 and a median value of 3 82 lend additional support that high values of the ratio in our dataset point towards na associated alkalinity this observation is in clear contrast to that expected in tropical aquatic systems which are often found to be dominated by carbonate dissolution tripathy and singh 2010 however a few studies from peninsular india exist that document appreciable solute supply from saline alkaline soils rengarajan et al 2009 rai et al 2010 das et al 2011 in arid to semi arid regions these sodium rich soils form through excessive evaporation of rivers floods and groundwater through capillary actions during the lean phases these soils mainly composed of na cl hco3 and so4 2 are characterized by fast dissolution kinetics the high abundance of these soils in semi arid regions and their rapid dissolution during wet phases can explain the observed higher solute contribution from the salt affected soils fig 6 this additional solute source is responsible for groundwater chemistry of na cl hco3 type in semi arid regions which is distinctly different from typical ca mg hco3 chemistry for groundwater the na rich composition of semi arid groundwater may have a distinct effect on human health and agricultural activities na rich groundwater increases the blood pressure level in the body which can result in cardiac arrest blaustein et al 2012 high na has an adverse effect on agricultural activity it reduces water availability due to the formation of salts which affects the yield it also reduces the water infiltration rate reducing crop yield and quality hussain et al 2019 6 conclusion and future perspectives previously we reported high fluoride from a semi arid region in western india the region is known to have the occurrence of soil salts however their impact on groundwater chemistry was not investigated in earlier studies as a part of our extensive geochemical investigation of the groundwater of the same region here we investigated the major ions and δd δ18o and δ13cdic of seventy two groundwater samples the objectives are to quantify the solute sources and intensity of water rock interaction by using major ions data and their inverse modelling trace groundwater origin from the water isotope data and identify sources of dic and the sub surface weathering processes from δ13cdic and major ion data in these semi arid aquifers major ions data for these samples from a semi arid region show a significant solute supply from salt affected soils in the basin in addition to atmospheric deposition and bedrock weathering the dominancy of na k and cl in these samples also confirms the leaching of these soils with faster dissolution kinetics the δ13cdic of these samples varies between 7 4 and 16 4 comparison of these isotopic data with their possible sources indicates a supply of dissolved inorganic carbon via weathering of bedrocks and leaching of salt affected soils mass balance calculations of the major ions dataset using an inversion approach estimate that on average about one third of the solute load of the groundwater samples is supplied through the salt affected soils the relative contributions from rock dissolution such as silicate 23 12 and carbonate 15 13 weathering are significantly lower than that of the saline soils the dominancy of salt affected soils in regulating groundwater chemistry is mainly linked to high evaporation in these arid regions these samples also yield a lower slope 5 2 for the δd δ18o regression line than that of the gmwl line 8 supporting the significant impact of evaporation on the hydrology of this region future directions of research on groundwater of the region may include using cl and br isotopes δ37cl and δ81br to understand better the origin of salinity nitrogen δ15n and lithium δ7li isotopes to understand the influence of anthropogenic inputs in groundwater and 87sr 86sr to pinpoint the silicate versus carbonate weathering processes better in addition to chemical and isotopic tools the use of multivariate statistical analyses like principal component analysis factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to understand the dynamics of groundwater salinization techniques like predictive modelling and simulation which include machine learning and inverse modelling can serve as reliable tools the future of groundwater science is possibly lies in providing statistically optimal predictions with maximal precision especially when point measurements are sparse therefore statistical and machine learning techniques should be used to create salinity maps and address the proper management and
