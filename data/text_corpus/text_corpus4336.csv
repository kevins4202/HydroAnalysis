transformation during the wave breaking process are presented keywords breaking waves two phase flow model wave structure interaction conical structure volume of fluid method 1 introduction solitary waves were first discovered by john scott russell in 1834 while carrying out experiments to determine the most efficient design for canal boats russell 1844 the solitary wave is often used to study nearshore wave propagation and coastal effects synolakis and bernard 2006 however little attention has been paid to investigate three dimensional 3d breaking solitary waves over complex topography due to wave nonlinearities and complexity which are very important in ocean engineering and coastal defences the challenge is further increased in the post breaking process with air entrainment and jet splashing cycles kiger and duncan 2012 many experimental investigations of breaking solitary waves were carried out which provided important details in understanding the run up height of water waves on shores and their hydrodynamic loads on coastal structures laboratory measurements were carried out to study the run up of non breaking and breaking solitary waves on a 1 19 85 sloping beach synolakis 1986 the empirical run up relations for non breaking waves were derived and improved our understanding of the run up process water surface profiles during the wave run up process were presented and it was found that the maximum run up of the incident wave depends on its breaking characteristics there were also laboratory measurements to study the overturning of a solitary wave over a reef yasuda et al 1997 the shoaling effect of wave breaking by reefs was investigated instead of slopes and it was found that the size of the overturning jet changes depending on the relative height of the submerged reef detailed experimental investigation of the splash up of breaking solitary waves on a 1 15 sloping beach and vertical walls was performed in li 2000 detailed profiles for the overturning jet and subsequent splash up were presented in that study two different wave breaking types were found from the experiments if the plunging jet impinges on a dry slope no splash up occurs and the breaking wave simply collapses if the plunging jet impinges on a water surface the splash up is observed and a reflected jet is generated with both clockwise and counter clockwise vortices for the dynamics of the early stages of the solitary wave run up at a steep beach jensen et al 2003 it was found that the steepening wave front neither develops into plunging nor spilling breakers due to the steep beach through particle image velocimetry measurements the velocity and acceleration patterns of a collapsing breaker was investigated in jensen et al 2005 and it was found that the jet is mainly formed at the crest of the wave in plunging breakers whereas the jet is formed over the whole height of the wave in collapsing breakers non breaking and breaking solitary wave run up has been studied intensively by different numerical approaches such as using the shallow water equations titov and synolakis 1995 li and raichlen 2002 the boussinesq equations zelt 1991 the shallow water equations with the incorporation of boussinesq terms stansby 2003 borthwick et al 2006 a fully nonlinear potential flow model grilli et al 1997 a single phase navier stokes model lin et al 1999 lo and shao 2002 or a two phase navier stokes model guignard et al 2001 xie 2012 the depth averaged models might be difficult to model the water surface profile during wave overturning and breaking the discrepancy is due to the hydrostatic pressure assumption and the lack of the treatment of the bottom friction effect as discussed in lin et al 1999 and li and raichlen 2002 the fully nonlinear potential flow method can simulate the physics of wave shoaling on the beach and provide detailed information like the shape of plunging jet breaking index and velocity field during wave breaking but it is not able to calculate the maximum run up and energy dissipation as the computation terminates when the plunging jet impinges on the water surface for three dimensional breaking solitary waves a laboratory experiment was carried out in briggs et al 1995 for the run up of solitary waves on a conical island liu et al 1995 presented an early numerical study of a solitary wave run up over a conical island based on the two dimensional shallow water wave equations and good agreement between the numerical model and the laboratory data for the water surface displacement and maximum run up heights was obtained later an analytical method kanoglu and synolakis 1998 was developed for determining the wave evolution for piecewise linear topographies which allowed predicting the run up of solitary waves on a conical island since then this experiment is considered as a benchmark problem for validating numerical models for free surface flows such as shallow water equations titov and synolakis 1998 bradford and sanders 2002 hubbard and dodd 2002 wei et al 2006 valiani and begnudelli 2006 synolakis et al 2008 boussinesq type equations chen et al 2000 lynett et al 2002 fuhrman and madsen 2008 depth integrated non hydrostatic model yamazaki et al 2009 fang et al 2015 three dimensional single phase hydrodynamic model chen 2004 and the commercial cfd code flow 3d based wave boundary condition choi et al 2007 and the internal mass source wavemaker approach chen and hsiao 2016 and the two phase open source code openfoam higuera et al 2013 however none of them studied a breaking solitary wave for a submerged conical frustum which is an important wave structure interaction phenomenon in coastal and ocean engineering applications the objective of this study is to investigate the kinematics and dynamics of 3d breaking solitary waves over surface piercing and submerged conical structures including wave pre breaking overturning and post breaking processes which have rarely been studied in previous investigations the two phase flow model developed by xie 2015 which solves the flow in the air and water simultaneously is validated first for simulating 3d breaking waves over an emergent conical island before it is applied to a fully submerged conical frustum and physical details and insights of the flow during wave overturning are elucidated the organization of this paper is as follows the description of the mathematical model for two phase flow of breaking waves is described in section 2 the numerical method is presented in section 3 the results for 3d breaking of solitary waves over conical structures are presented and discussed in section 4 the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations in this study the large eddy simulation les approach stoesser 2014 is employed and the governing equations for the incompressible newtonian two phase flow are based on the spatially filtered navier stokes equations given as 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u t u ρ g τ sgs where the overbar denotes the spatial filtering over the mesh in cartesian coordinates x y z t is the time u u v w is the filtered velocity vector p is the filtered pressure g is the gravitational acceleration vector ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively the term τ sgs ρ u u u u is the sub grid scale sgs stress tensor and the anisotropic part of the sgs term is modelled by an eddy viscosity model of the form smagorinsky 1963 3 τ sgs 1 3 trace τ sgs i 2 μ t s where i is the unit tensor and s is the strain rate tensor of the resolved field μ t is the turbulent eddy viscosity defined as 4 μ t ρ c s δ 2 s and s 2 s s where the cut off length scale is δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 and the smagorinsky coefficient c s 0 1 is used in the present study the symbol for spatial filtering is dropped hereinafter for simplicity in order to solve the momentum equation the fluid property is closed with the constitutive relations for the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid as given by 5 ρ f ρ w 1 f ρ a 6 μ f μ w 1 f μ a where the superscripts w and a denote water and air respectively f is the volume fraction defined as 7 f 1 if only fluid water is present 0 if only fluid air is present the air water interface is then within the cells where 0 f 1 and the volume fraction f has a zero material derivative 8 d f d t f t u f 0 these equations complete the mathematical description of the two phase flow model used in the present study 2 2 initial and boundary conditions in order to completely solve the problem it is necessary to define the boundary conditions of the computational domain the solitary waves are generated from the inlet where the time history of the velocity fields is prescribed as dirichlet boundary condition xie 2012 as the vof method is used here to capture the air water interface the time history of the water surface elevation is transformed to the volume fraction distribution at the inlet where the cell above the interface is f 0 and the cell below the interface is f 1 while the cell containing the interface is calculated by its local height on the solid boundary the wall model cabot and moin 2000 is used for the near wall treatment in the les for the outlet a radiative boundary condition is applied as both fluids i e air and water are solved simultaneously in the present two phase flow model the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are implemented and they do not need to be specified explicitly at the air water interface in the computation the initial flow field at t 0 has to be prescribed and more details can be found in xie 2015 3 numerical method for the sake of brevity only a brief description of the numerical method is presented here and more details of the numerical method for the in house two phase flow code xdolphin3d can be found in previous works xie 2012 2015 xie and stoesser 2020 in this study the governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method on a staggered cartesian grid the advection terms are discretized by a high resolution scheme xie 2012 which combines high order accuracy with monotonicity whereas the gradients in pressure and diffusion terms are obtained by central difference schemes in order to deal with complex geometries in cartesian grids the cut cell method in 3d xie and stoesser 2020 is utilized in the finite volume discretization the advective and diffusive fluxes at cell faces as well as cell volume are modified in cut cells the piso algorithm issa 1986 is employed in the present study for the pressure velocity coupling and a backward finite difference discretization is used for the time derivative which leads to an implicit scheme for the governing equations in this study the air water interface is captured by a high resolution vof scheme cicsam compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes ubbink 1997 which does not need to reconstruct the interface after each time step the present model has been validated against available experimental data for overturning waves over a sloping beach and a reef xie 2012 periodic breaking waves in the surf zone xie 2013 2017 breaking solitary waves over a slope xie 2014 focusing wave over a fixed structure yan et al 2019 and breaking waves over complex topography xie 2015 in which the overturning jet air entrainment and splash up have been captured during wave breaking in addition the code has also been validated and applied for some les studies of open channel flows over rough surfaces xie et al 2013a b 2014 and free surface flows with moving bodies xie and stoesser 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 3d solitary waves over a surface piercing conical island 4 1 1 experimental and computational setup physical model studies for a solitary wave run up on a conical island were conducted at the coastal and hydraulic laboratory engineer research and development center u s army corps of engineers briggs et al 1995 fig 1 shows the schematic of the laboratory setup where a conical island was constructed in the centre of a 25 m long and 30 m wide wave basin the conical island is 0 625 m high with diameters of 7 2 m at the toe and 2 2 m at the crest and the slope is 1 4 27 capacitance wave gauges were used to measure the water surface elevations and the maximum run up heights were recorded in 20 locations around the perimeter of the island the details of the experiment can be found in briggs et al 1995 and liu et al 1995 three incident wave cases for h d 0 05 0 1 0 2 with the water depth d 0 32 m are considered in the present study but only the results for the steepest wave case h d 0 2 are presented here for the sake of brevity the computational domain is identical to the experimental setup and is discretized by a 250 250 30 nonuniform grid with minimum meshes of δ x δ y 0 072 m uniformly distributed in the island region and δ z 0 01 m in the vicinity of the water surface it is noted that this grid resolution is sufficient to give representative flow features in comparison with other researchers although the mesh might not be refined for detailed les study a mesh convergence study has also been carried out in a fine 500 500 60 mesh which doubles the grid resolution in each direction and the results are shown in next section the initial time step is δ t 0 01 s and changed with the cfl condition due to the interface capture scheme the computation is run up to 20 s which is similar to previous studies in the simulation the solitary wave is generated at the inlet by specifying the water surface elevation and velocity field based on the analytical solution dean and dalrymple 1984 the no slip boundary condition is specified on the bottom top and both side walls of the domain and along the island the radiative boundary condition is applied at the outlet to let the wave propagate out of the computational domain this simulation was run in serial and the cpu time was approximately 24 h 4 1 2 comparisons between laboratory measurements and numerical results fig 2 shows the wave run up on the island as photographs from the experiment left column and as predicted by the numerical simulation right column which allows a qualitative comparison of simulation with experiment the run up height increases significantly on the lee side of the island due to the collision of two trapped waves in general the pictures suggest that an acceptable agreement between the experiment and numerical simulation is obtained fig 3 a plots experimentally measured and computed wave surface displacements at five representative gauges obtained by both sets of meshes gauge 3 is located half a wave length upstream from the toe of the island gauge 6 is located on the front side of the toe of the island and gauges 9 16 and 22 are on the front side and rear face of the island near the still water shoreline see fig 1 for the location of wave gauges it can be seen that there is a only slight difference between two meshes which both reasonably agree with the experimental measurements thus only the results obtained with the 250 250 30 grid are presented and discussed hereinafter primary wave height and shape are both well predicted by the simulation however the secondary depression wave is slightly underestimated compared to the experimental measurements in particular at gauge 9 there is some phase shift at gauge 16 where earlier arrival of the wave is predicted by the numerical simulation on the side of the island it is noted that wave breaking is observed during the experiment at final stages of transformation near the shoreline and also on the lee side of the island due to the collision of two trapped waves for h d 0 2 and previous numerical models overestimated the wave height at this location as the wave breaking process was not taken into account nevertheless the current simulation exhibits good agreement of the wave height for gauge 22 due to use of the two phase flow model and also the consideration of energy dissipation of breaking waves from the les model there appears to be a slight phase difference for the wave surface displacement on the lee side of the island at gauge 22 which is where the simulation predicts later arrival of the wave in comparison to the experiment this has also been found in previous numerical studies using different models such as the shallow water equation hubbard and dodd 2002 bradford and sanders 2002 boussinesq model fuhrman and madsen 2008 non hydrostatic 3d model yamazaki et al 2009 and the openfoam higuera et al 2013 fig 3 b plots computed maximum run up heights blue line together with experimental data red circles shallow water model liu et al 1995 and a 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model choi et al 2007 this allows a quantitative assessment of the simulation s ability to predict the wave run up the local coordinate 270 corresponds to the front face of the island see fig 1 a the vertical run up heights defined by the minimum shoreline depth of 0 002 m are converted to the horizontal direction and are normalized by the radius of the initial shore line very satisfying agreement between the present numerical simulations and experimental measurements is obtained the run up height is greater on the front side of the island and decreases as the wave bends towards the lee side of the island compared to other cases for h d 0 05 0 1 not shown here the higher incident wave h d 0 2 produces higher run up heights on the front side of the island as more kinetic energy is contained in the higher incident wave which is converted into potential energy in form of the run up height it can be seen from fig 3 b that similar results are obtained from the present model and the 3d rans model and they predicted better results than the shallow water model especially on the front side of the island 4 1 3 wave island dynamics fig 4 presents snapshots of water surface elevations for the h d 0 2 incident wave case in the vicinity of the conical island at four selected instants in time the crest line is nearly parallel to the wave generator before reaching the island once the wave approaches the island the crest line bends due to wave refraction and diffraction by the island when the wave reaches the maximum run up height on the front face of the island fig 4 a the wave is at its peak in the middle of the shoreline after that two trapped waves form and propagate along each side of the shoreline of the island fig 4 b as the wave moves faster due to greater depth the incident wave in the offshore region away from the island reaches the middle of the island whilst the wave on the island shore is left behind due to its slower speed after the wave runs up the front face of the island the wave starts to run down and generates a cylindrical wave pattern fig 4 c which is similar to the one observed by liu et al 1995 the two trapped waves wrap around the island and move towards the lee side eventually the two trapped waves collide with each other on the lee side of the island and a significant run up height is observed fig 4 d which is consistent with the experimental measurements briggs et al 1995 at this moment the incident wave is moving offshore while the trapped waves are moving alongshore the depression wave due to the wave running down the island can also be observed in fig 4 d 4 1 4 velocity fields detailed velocity fields in selected planes and cross sections are shown in the following providing insights into the wave kinematics during the run up of the solitary wave which cannot be obtained from depth integrated 2d models two different instants in time t 6 7 s i e when the wave reaches the maximum run up height on the front face of the island and t 9 0 s i e when the two trapped waves wrap around the island are considered fig 5 shows velocity vectors in horizontal z planes the front and rear sides of the island are shown for t 6 7 s and t 9 0 s respectively three z planes corresponding to the bottom middle and surface layers of the wave are shown at t 6 7 s the wave in the offshore region moves in the same direction as the incident wave whereas the wave near the water line bends around the island due to the island s bathymetry high velocities are observed in the surface layer on the front of the island due to the wave run up at t 9 0 s the wave moves to the rear side of the island and it can be seen that the direction of the offshore wave has been changed an angle from the direction of the incident wave due to wave refraction and diffraction by the island high velocities are observed in the surface layer as the trapped wave moves towards the lee side of the island it is worth noting that the horizontal velocities are higher near the surface than near the bottom which is similar to the results obtained with the commercial code flow 3d choi et al 2007 fig 6 shows the velocity fields in selected longitudinal y planes y 0 m is the cross section in the axis of symmetry y 3 6 m is located at the toe of the island and y 1 8 m is in the middle of the two the vertical acceleration of the flow around the island is seen from these planes at t 6 7 s high velocities are observed near the shore line in the central plane due to the wave run up recirculation of air flow can be seen above the crest of the wave as the air is driven by the water at t 9 0 s the wave starts to run down the front of the island and high velocities are observed in the trapped waves in the middle plane 4 2 3d overturning waves over a submerged conical frustum in this section the kinematics and dynamics of three dimensional breaking waves of an overturning wave over a submerged conical frustum is considered which to the best of the author s knowledge has not been studied previously 4 2 1 computational setup the computational setup is similar to that described in section 4 1 but for a smaller fully submerged conical frustum with the same slope 1 4 fig 7 shows the schematic of the computational setup where the origin of the coordinates is located at the still water level in the centre of the conical frustum and all lengths are normalized by the water depth d 0 32 m the conical frustum is 0 256 m high with diameters of 2 56 m at the toe and 0 512 m at the top and the slope is 1 4 the incident planar solitary wave with h d 0 5 is considered here the computational domain which has a length of 4 48 m width of 2 56 m and height of 0 64 m is discretized by a 350 80 70 grid in the normalized streamwise x x d spanwise y y d and vertical z z d directions respectively the mesh resolution is selected based on our experience to capture the air water interface during wave breaking and also to resolve the large scale turbulence it is worth noting that the mesh might not be fine enough to resolve the wall boundary layer which is not the focus of the present study the grid is uniform in the x and y directions and nonuniform finer meshes in the vicinity of the water surface in the z direction with minimum meshes of δ x 0 0128 m δ y 0 032 m and δ z 0 0064 m this simulation was run in serial and the cpu time was approximately 24 h 4 2 2 water surface profiles and kinematics fig 8 shows a sequence of snapshots at selected instants in time of water surface profiles during wave overturning over a submerged conical frustum the colour contour on the water surface represents the distribution of normalized velocity components u v and w respectively when the wave approaches the submerged frustum at t 1 0 s fig 8 a there is only a small change in the shape of the incident planar wave and the crest line is nearly straight and parallel to the y axis the velocity component u has a similar magnitude on the front and the rear face of the wave with a higher value in the vicinity of the wave crest the velocity component w is nearly symmetrical with respect to the crest line which follows the elliptical water particle trajectory both u and w velocities resemble the feature of 3d planar waves the velocity component v is very small compared with the u and w components due to the change of bottom topography and wave scattering by the submerged frustum it can be seen that the water moves towards both sides in front of the frustum whereas it moves towards the central plane in the rear side of the frustum when the wave arrives at the crest of the submerged frustum at t 1 4 s fig 8 b there is a significant change in the wave shape which leads to a three dimensional wave profile the streamwise velocity u is highest in the central plane and gradually decreases on either side and the maximum value increases from 0 4 c t 1 0 s to 0 6 c t 1 4 s where c g d h is the wave phase speed the vertical velocity w becomes asymmetrical and the magnitude in the positive direction is twice that in the negative direction the spanwise velocity v increases from 0 02 c t 1 0 s to 0 1 c t 1 4 s during the wave passing the frustum which can be clearly seen on the front face of the wave all these phenomena are related to focusing of the wave over the submerged frustum because the wave in the central plane propagates faster due to wave focusing after the frustum the wave crest plunges forward to overturn when passing the crest of the submerged frustum at t 1 8 s a three dimensional overturning wave can be observed in fig 8 c during wave overturning it is shown that the streamwise velocity u in the plunging jet is higher than the wave phase speed c which is consistent with the common sense criterion that u c 1 during wave breaking far from the central plane the streamwise velocity is less than the wave phase speed c and the wave propagates forward without breaking the vertical velocity w is positive on the front face of the wave and negative on the rear face and the tip of the plunging jet at this moment the overturning wave starts to curl down as it can be seen from the sign of the vertical velocity during wave overturning the spanwise velocity v in the plunging jet is very small and the highest spanwise velocity is located near the toe of the plunging jet on both sides at t 2 0 s fig 8 d the plunging jet curls down and impinges on the water surface ahead to generate the splash up and an air cavity is enclosed beneath the overturning jet during the wave splash up the breaking region gets wider as time increases when more of the wave plunges forward and it is apparent that u c 1 in the plunging jet and the subsequent splash up the vertical velocity w is different from that during wave overturning as the plunging jet moves downwards until it touches down the air water interface and it move upwards during the splash up process contrast to the spanwise velocity v in the plunging jet during wave overturning it changes significantly during wave splash up the shoulders of the plunging jet move away from the tip whereas the top of the plunging jet moves towards the central plane fig 9 shows detailed views of the overturning wave during and after wave breaking perspective side and front views are shown in the top bottom left and bottom right respectively a typical three dimensional overturning jet can be seen in fig 9 a during wave breaking and the width of the overturning jet is about half of the top diameter of the submerged frustum a tube is formed beneath the overturning wave during the splash up as shown in fig 9 b and the width of the overturning jet increases as more of the wave plunges forward it is worth noting that in a 3d overturning wave the air in the tube might escape in the spanwise directions which is different from a 2d case 4 2 3 velocity fields fig 10 shows the evolution of velocity vectors in two longitudinal y planes at three selected instants in time the velocity vectors are normalized by the wave phase speed c 2 17 m s the velocities in the central plane y 0 are shown on the top whereas the velocities near the edge of the computational domain y 3 9 are presented on the bottom when the wave approaches the submerged frustum fig 10 a there is nearly no change of the water surface between the centre and edge and thus the flow patterns in two planes are very similar apart from the area near the frustum recirculation of air flow can be clearly seen above the crest of the wave as the air is driven by the water when the wave arrives at the crest of the frustum fig 10 b due to wave focusing after the frustum the wave in the central plane moves faster and this is evident by comparing the water surface profiles and the velocities near the centre of the frustum up to this stage there is no significant change in the flow pattern near the edge plane during wave overturning over the submerged conical frustum fig 10 c large velocity vectors are observed beneath the plunging jet as the air tries to escape from the enclosed cavity the velocity vectors in the wave crest are nearly horizontal during wave breaking in contrast to the central plane the wave near the edge plane is moving with lower speed without wave breaking fig 11 shows velocity vectors in selected horizontal z planes in the water two instantaneous results when the wave approaches the frustum t 1 0 s and when the wave passes the frustum t 1 8 s are presented three z planes corresponding to the bottom z d 0 02 middle z d 0 14 and top z d 0 30 layers of the water are shown the wave is scattered by the submerged frustum as the water moves towards the sides in front of the frustum and towards the central plane in the lee side of the frustum it is worth noting that horizontal velocities increase from the bottom to the top layer of the water which might question the uniform horizontal velocity assumption in depth integrated models fig 12 shows velocity vectors of in selected cross sections or x planes from the front edge x 4 to the rear edge x 4 of the frustum during wave breaking at t 1 8 s the wave moves away from the frustum on the front side of the frustum x 4 to x 0 due to wave scattering whereas it moves towards the frustum on the rear side of the frustum x 2 and x 4 due to wave focusing the x 2 plane is near the crest of the wave and it is shown that large velocity vectors are located near the water surface as the wave overturns and curls down it is noted that the water moves upward on the front face of the wave x 4 whereas the water moves downwards on the back face of the wave x 4 to x 2 from the 3d velocity field it is shown that the velocities increase from the bottom to the water surface and large velocity vectors are located under the crest of the wave it is apparent that the wave is dominated by the longitudinal motion whilst spanwise motion is very weak the velocity is highest near the central plane and the maximum velocity vector is observed during wave overturning 4 2 4 energy dissipation and transfer the energy dissipation and transformation during the solitary wave run up on the conical island is quantified it is worth emphasizing that the total energy and its components are calculated for the entire computational domain rather than for a fixed volume of water over one wave length so the values of normalized energy may change according to the size of computational domain even if the size of frustum is constant the kinetic energy ke potential energy pe and total energy te are obtained as dean and dalrymple 1984 9 ke f 0 ρ u 2 v 2 w 2 2 d z d x d y 10 pe f 0 ρ g z d z d x d y f 0 ρ g z d z d x d y t 0 11 te pe ke in order to study the effect of the submerged frustum on water waves another simulation has been performed but for a flat bottom case no frustum fig 13 shows the time history of normalized energy for the overturning wave over the submerged conical frustum together with the corresponding energy when there is no frustum all energies increase up to t 1 0 s as the wave propagates into the computational domain and decrease after t 2 0 s as the wave leaves the domain when there is no frustum it is shown that the energies decrease slightly due to the viscous dissipation and the lines remain parallel hence there is no significant energy transfer between kinetic and potential energies with the submerged frustum present there is more energy dissipation compared to the case without frustum which is due to the wave breaking due to the bathymetry of the frustum kinetic energy is converted to potential energy when the wave approaches the frustum when the wave arrives at the top of the frustum potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy which attains its maximum value during wave breaking after wave breaking kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases slightly during the jet splash cycle 5 conclusions in this paper a large eddy simulation based two phase flow model has been employed to investigate 3d breaking solitary

nearshore wave propagation and coastal effects synolakis and bernard 2006 however little attention has been paid to investigate three dimensional 3d breaking solitary waves over complex topography due to wave nonlinearities and complexity which are very important in ocean engineering and coastal defences the challenge is further increased in the post breaking process with air entrainment and jet splashing cycles kiger and duncan 2012 many experimental investigations of breaking solitary waves were carried out which provided important details in understanding the run up height of water waves on shores and their hydrodynamic loads on coastal structures laboratory measurements were carried out to study the run up of non breaking and breaking solitary waves on a 1 19 85 sloping beach synolakis 1986 the empirical run up relations for non breaking waves were derived and improved our understanding of the run up process water surface profiles during the wave run up process were presented and it was found that the maximum run up of the incident wave depends on its breaking characteristics there were also laboratory measurements to study the overturning of a solitary wave over a reef yasuda et al 1997 the shoaling effect of wave breaking by reefs was investigated instead of slopes and it was found that the size of the overturning jet changes depending on the relative height of the submerged reef detailed experimental investigation of the splash up of breaking solitary waves on a 1 15 sloping beach and vertical walls was performed in li 2000 detailed profiles for the overturning jet and subsequent splash up were presented in that study two different wave breaking types were found from the experiments if the plunging jet impinges on a dry slope no splash up occurs and the breaking wave simply collapses if the plunging jet impinges on a water surface the splash up is observed and a reflected jet is generated with both clockwise and counter clockwise vortices for the dynamics of the early stages of the solitary wave run up at a steep beach jensen et al 2003 it was found that the steepening wave front neither develops into plunging nor spilling breakers due to the steep beach through particle image velocimetry measurements the velocity and acceleration patterns of a collapsing breaker was investigated in jensen et al 2005 and it was found that the jet is mainly formed at the crest of the wave in plunging breakers whereas the jet is formed over the whole height of the wave in collapsing breakers non breaking and breaking solitary wave run up has been studied intensively by different numerical approaches such as using the shallow water equations titov and synolakis 1995 li and raichlen 2002 the boussinesq equations zelt 1991 the shallow water equations with the incorporation of boussinesq terms stansby 2003 borthwick et al 2006 a fully nonlinear potential flow model grilli et al 1997 a single phase navier stokes model lin et al 1999 lo and shao 2002 or a two phase navier stokes model guignard et al 2001 xie 2012 the depth averaged models might be difficult to model the water surface profile during wave overturning and breaking the discrepancy is due to the hydrostatic pressure assumption and the lack of the treatment of the bottom friction effect as discussed in lin et al 1999 and li and raichlen 2002 the fully nonlinear potential flow method can simulate the physics of wave shoaling on the beach and provide detailed information like the shape of plunging jet breaking index and velocity field during wave breaking but it is not able to calculate the maximum run up and energy dissipation as the computation terminates when the plunging jet impinges on the water surface for three dimensional breaking solitary waves a laboratory experiment was carried out in briggs et al 1995 for the run up of solitary waves on a conical island liu et al 1995 presented an early numerical study of a solitary wave run up over a conical island based on the two dimensional shallow water wave equations and good agreement between the numerical model and the laboratory data for the water surface displacement and maximum run up heights was obtained later an analytical method kanoglu and synolakis 1998 was developed for determining the wave evolution for piecewise linear topographies which allowed predicting the run up of solitary waves on a conical island since then this experiment is considered as a benchmark problem for validating numerical models for free surface flows such as shallow water equations titov and synolakis 1998 bradford and sanders 2002 hubbard and dodd 2002 wei et al 2006 valiani and begnudelli 2006 synolakis et al 2008 boussinesq type equations chen et al 2000 lynett et al 2002 fuhrman and madsen 2008 depth integrated non hydrostatic model yamazaki et al 2009 fang et al 2015 three dimensional single phase hydrodynamic model chen 2004 and the commercial cfd code flow 3d based wave boundary condition choi et al 2007 and the internal mass source wavemaker approach chen and hsiao 2016 and the two phase open source code openfoam higuera et al 2013 however none of them studied a breaking solitary wave for a submerged conical frustum which is an important wave structure interaction phenomenon in coastal and ocean engineering applications the objective of this study is to investigate the kinematics and dynamics of 3d breaking solitary waves over surface piercing and submerged conical structures including wave pre breaking overturning and post breaking processes which have rarely been studied in previous investigations the two phase flow model developed by xie 2015 which solves the flow in the air and water simultaneously is validated first for simulating 3d breaking waves over an emergent conical island before it is applied to a fully submerged conical frustum and physical details and insights of the flow during wave overturning are elucidated the organization of this paper is as follows the description of the mathematical model for two phase flow of breaking waves is described in section 2 the numerical method is presented in section 3 the results for 3d breaking of solitary waves over conical structures are presented and discussed in section 4 the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations in this study the large eddy simulation les approach stoesser 2014 is employed and the governing equations for the incompressible newtonian two phase flow are based on the spatially filtered navier stokes equations given as 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u t u ρ g τ sgs where the overbar denotes the spatial filtering over the mesh in cartesian coordinates x y z t is the time u u v w is the filtered velocity vector p is the filtered pressure g is the gravitational acceleration vector ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively the term τ sgs ρ u u u u is the sub grid scale sgs stress tensor and the anisotropic part of the sgs term is modelled by an eddy viscosity model of the form smagorinsky 1963 3 τ sgs 1 3 trace τ sgs i 2 μ t s where i is the unit tensor and s is the strain rate tensor of the resolved field μ t is the turbulent eddy viscosity defined as 4 μ t ρ c s δ 2 s and s 2 s s where the cut off length scale is δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 and the smagorinsky coefficient c s 0 1 is used in the present study the symbol for spatial filtering is dropped hereinafter for simplicity in order to solve the momentum equation the fluid property is closed with the constitutive relations for the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid as given by 5 ρ f ρ w 1 f ρ a 6 μ f μ w 1 f μ a where the superscripts w and a denote water and air respectively f is the volume fraction defined as 7 f 1 if only fluid water is present 0 if only fluid air is present the air water interface is then within the cells where 0 f 1 and the volume fraction f has a zero material derivative 8 d f d t f t u f 0 these equations complete the mathematical description of the two phase flow model used in the present study 2 2 initial and boundary conditions in order to completely solve the problem it is necessary to define the boundary conditions of the computational domain the solitary waves are generated from the inlet where the time history of the velocity fields is prescribed as dirichlet boundary condition xie 2012 as the vof method is used here to capture the air water interface the time history of the water surface elevation is transformed to the volume fraction distribution at the inlet where the cell above the interface is f 0 and the cell below the interface is f 1 while the cell containing the interface is calculated by its local height on the solid boundary the wall model cabot and moin 2000 is used for the near wall treatment in the les for the outlet a radiative boundary condition is applied as both fluids i e air and water are solved simultaneously in the present two phase flow model the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are implemented and they do not need to be specified explicitly at the air water interface in the computation the initial flow field at t 0 has to be prescribed and more details can be found in xie 2015 3 numerical method for the sake of brevity only a brief description of the numerical method is presented here and more details of the numerical method for the in house two phase flow code xdolphin3d can be found in previous works xie 2012 2015 xie and stoesser 2020 in this study the governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method on a staggered cartesian grid the advection terms are discretized by a high resolution scheme xie 2012 which combines high order accuracy with monotonicity whereas the gradients in pressure and diffusion terms are obtained by central difference schemes in order to deal with complex geometries in cartesian grids the cut cell method in 3d xie and stoesser 2020 is utilized in the finite volume discretization the advective and diffusive fluxes at cell faces as well as cell volume are modified in cut cells the piso algorithm issa 1986 is employed in the present study for the pressure velocity coupling and a backward finite difference discretization is used for the time derivative which leads to an implicit scheme for the governing equations in this study the air water interface is captured by a high resolution vof scheme cicsam compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes ubbink 1997 which does not need to reconstruct the interface after each time step the present model has been validated against available experimental data for overturning waves over a sloping beach and a reef xie 2012 periodic breaking waves in the surf zone xie 2013 2017 breaking solitary waves over a slope xie 2014 focusing wave over a fixed structure yan et al 2019 and breaking waves over complex topography xie 2015 in which the overturning jet air entrainment and splash up have been captured during wave breaking in addition the code has also been validated and applied for some les studies of open channel flows over rough surfaces xie et al 2013a b 2014 and free surface flows with moving bodies xie and stoesser 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 3d solitary waves over a surface piercing conical island 4 1 1 experimental and computational setup physical model studies for a solitary wave run up on a conical island were conducted at the coastal and hydraulic laboratory engineer research and development center u s army corps of engineers briggs et al 1995 fig 1 shows the schematic of the laboratory setup where a conical island was constructed in the centre of a 25 m long and 30 m wide wave basin the conical island is 0 625 m high with diameters of 7 2 m at the toe and 2 2 m at the crest and the slope is 1 4 27 capacitance wave gauges were used to measure the water surface elevations and the maximum run up heights were recorded in 20 locations around the perimeter of the island the details of the experiment can be found in briggs et al 1995 and liu et al 1995 three incident wave cases for h d 0 05 0 1 0 2 with the water depth d 0 32 m are considered in the present study but only the results for the steepest wave case h d 0 2 are presented here for the sake of brevity the computational domain is identical to the experimental setup and is discretized by a 250 250 30 nonuniform grid with minimum meshes of δ x δ y 0 072 m uniformly distributed in the island region and δ z 0 01 m in the vicinity of the water surface it is noted that this grid resolution is sufficient to give representative flow features in comparison with other researchers although the mesh might not be refined for detailed les study a mesh convergence study has also been carried out in a fine 500 500 60 mesh which doubles the grid resolution in each direction and the results are shown in next section the initial time step is δ t 0 01 s and changed with the cfl condition due to the interface capture scheme the computation is run up to 20 s which is similar to previous studies in the simulation the solitary wave is generated at the inlet by specifying the water surface elevation and velocity field based on the analytical solution dean and dalrymple 1984 the no slip boundary condition is specified on the bottom top and both side walls of the domain and along the island the radiative boundary condition is applied at the outlet to let the wave propagate out of the computational domain this simulation was run in serial and the cpu time was approximately 24 h 4 1 2 comparisons between laboratory measurements and numerical results fig 2 shows the wave run up on the island as photographs from the experiment left column and as predicted by the numerical simulation right column which allows a qualitative comparison of simulation with experiment the run up height increases significantly on the lee side of the island due to the collision of two trapped waves in general the pictures suggest that an acceptable agreement between the experiment and numerical simulation is obtained fig 3 a plots experimentally measured and computed wave surface displacements at five representative gauges obtained by both sets of meshes gauge 3 is located half a wave length upstream from the toe of the island gauge 6 is located on the front side of the toe of the island and gauges 9 16 and 22 are on the front side and rear face of the island near the still water shoreline see fig 1 for the location of wave gauges it can be seen that there is a only slight difference between two meshes which both reasonably agree with the experimental measurements thus only the results obtained with the 250 250 30 grid are presented and discussed hereinafter primary wave height and shape are both well predicted by the simulation however the secondary depression wave is slightly underestimated compared to the experimental measurements in particular at gauge 9 there is some phase shift at gauge 16 where earlier arrival of the wave is predicted by the numerical simulation on the side of the island it is noted that wave breaking is observed during the experiment at final stages of transformation near the shoreline and also on the lee side of the island due to the collision of two trapped waves for h d 0 2 and previous numerical models overestimated the wave height at this location as the wave breaking process was not taken into account nevertheless the current simulation exhibits good agreement of the wave height for gauge 22 due to use of the two phase flow model and also the consideration of energy dissipation of breaking waves from the les model there appears to be a slight phase difference for the wave surface displacement on the lee side of the island at gauge 22 which is where the simulation predicts later arrival of the wave in comparison to the experiment this has also been found in previous numerical studies using different models such as the shallow water equation hubbard and dodd 2002 bradford and sanders 2002 boussinesq model fuhrman and madsen 2008 non hydrostatic 3d model yamazaki et al 2009 and the openfoam higuera et al 2013 fig 3 b plots computed maximum run up heights blue line together with experimental data red circles shallow water model liu et al 1995 and a 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model choi et al 2007 this allows a quantitative assessment of the simulation s ability to predict the wave run up the local coordinate 270 corresponds to the front face of the island see fig 1 a the vertical run up heights defined by the minimum shoreline depth of 0 002 m are converted to the horizontal direction and are normalized by the radius of the initial shore line very satisfying agreement between the present numerical simulations and experimental measurements is obtained the run up height is greater on the front side of the island and decreases as the wave bends towards the lee side of the island compared to other cases for h d 0 05 0 1 not shown here the higher incident wave h d 0 2 produces higher run up heights on the front side of the island as more kinetic energy is contained in the higher incident wave which is converted into potential energy in form of the run up height it can be seen from fig 3 b that similar results are obtained from the present model and the 3d rans model and they predicted better results than the shallow water model especially on the front side of the island 4 1 3 wave island dynamics fig 4 presents snapshots of water surface elevations for the h d 0 2 incident wave case in the vicinity of the conical island at four selected instants in time the crest line is nearly parallel to the wave generator before reaching the island once the wave approaches the island the crest line bends due to wave refraction and diffraction by the island when the wave reaches the maximum run up height on the front face of the island fig 4 a the wave is at its peak in the middle of the shoreline after that two trapped waves form and propagate along each side of the shoreline of the island fig 4 b as the wave moves faster due to greater depth the incident wave in the offshore region away from the island reaches the middle of the island whilst the wave on the island shore is left behind due to its slower speed after the wave runs up the front face of the island the wave starts to run down and generates a cylindrical wave pattern fig 4 c which is similar to the one observed by liu et al 1995 the two trapped waves wrap around the island and move towards the lee side eventually the two trapped waves collide with each other on the lee side of the island and a significant run up height is observed fig 4 d which is consistent with the experimental measurements briggs et al 1995 at this moment the incident wave is moving offshore while the trapped waves are moving alongshore the depression wave due to the wave running down the island can also be observed in fig 4 d 4 1 4 velocity fields detailed velocity fields in selected planes and cross sections are shown in the following providing insights into the wave kinematics during the run up of the solitary wave which cannot be obtained from depth integrated 2d models two different instants in time t 6 7 s i e when the wave reaches the maximum run up height on the front face of the island and t 9 0 s i e when the two trapped waves wrap around the island are considered fig 5 shows velocity vectors in horizontal z planes the front and rear sides of the island are shown for t 6 7 s and t 9 0 s respectively three z planes corresponding to the bottom middle and surface layers of the wave are shown at t 6 7 s the wave in the offshore region moves in the same direction as the incident wave whereas the wave near the water line bends around the island due to the island s bathymetry high velocities are observed in the surface layer on the front of the island due to the wave run up at t 9 0 s the wave moves to the rear side of the island and it can be seen that the direction of the offshore wave has been changed an angle from the direction of the incident wave due to wave refraction and diffraction by the island high velocities are observed in the surface layer as the trapped wave moves towards the lee side of the island it is worth noting that the horizontal velocities are higher near the surface than near the bottom which is similar to the results obtained with the commercial code flow 3d choi et al 2007 fig 6 shows the velocity fields in selected longitudinal y planes y 0 m is the cross section in the axis of symmetry y 3 6 m is located at the toe of the island and y 1 8 m is in the middle of the two the vertical acceleration of the flow around the island is seen from these planes at t 6 7 s high velocities are observed near the shore line in the central plane due to the wave run up recirculation of air flow can be seen above the crest of the wave as the air is driven by the water at t 9 0 s the wave starts to run down the front of the island and high velocities are observed in the trapped waves in the middle plane 4 2 3d overturning waves over a submerged conical frustum in this section the kinematics and dynamics of three dimensional breaking waves of an overturning wave over a submerged conical frustum is considered which to the best of the author s knowledge has not been studied previously 4 2 1 computational setup the computational setup is similar to that described in section 4 1 but for a smaller fully submerged conical frustum with the same slope 1 4 fig 7 shows the schematic of the computational setup where the origin of the coordinates is located at the still water level in the centre of the conical frustum and all lengths are normalized by the water depth d 0 32 m the conical frustum is 0 256 m high with diameters of 2 56 m at the toe and 0 512 m at the top and the slope is 1 4 the incident planar solitary wave with h d 0 5 is considered here the computational domain which has a length of 4 48 m width of 2 56 m and height of 0 64 m is discretized by a 350 80 70 grid in the normalized streamwise x x d spanwise y y d and vertical z z d directions respectively the mesh resolution is selected based on our experience to capture the air water interface during wave breaking and also to resolve the large scale turbulence it is worth noting that the mesh might not be fine enough to resolve the wall boundary layer which is not the focus of the present study the grid is uniform in the x and y directions and nonuniform finer meshes in the vicinity of the water surface in the z direction with minimum meshes of δ x 0 0128 m δ y 0 032 m and δ z 0 0064 m this simulation was run in serial and the cpu time was approximately 24 h 4 2 2 water surface profiles and kinematics fig 8 shows a sequence of snapshots at selected instants in time of water surface profiles during wave overturning over a submerged conical frustum the colour contour on the water surface represents the distribution of normalized velocity components u v and w respectively when the wave approaches the submerged frustum at t 1 0 s fig 8 a there is only a small change in the shape of the incident planar wave and the crest line is nearly straight and parallel to the y axis the velocity component u has a similar magnitude on the front and the rear face of the wave with a higher value in the vicinity of the wave crest the velocity component w is nearly symmetrical with respect to the crest line which follows the elliptical water particle trajectory both u and w velocities resemble the feature of 3d planar waves the velocity component v is very small compared with the u and w components due to the change of bottom topography and wave scattering by the submerged frustum it can be seen that the water moves towards both sides in front of the frustum whereas it moves towards the central plane in the rear side of the frustum when the wave arrives at the crest of the submerged frustum at t 1 4 s fig 8 b there is a significant change in the wave shape which leads to a three dimensional wave profile the streamwise velocity u is highest in the central plane and gradually decreases on either side and the maximum value increases from 0 4 c t 1 0 s to 0 6 c t 1 4 s where c g d h is the wave phase speed the vertical velocity w becomes asymmetrical and the magnitude in the positive direction is twice that in the negative direction the spanwise velocity v increases from 0 02 c t 1 0 s to 0 1 c t 1 4 s during the wave passing the frustum which can be clearly seen on the front face of the wave all these phenomena are related to focusing of the wave over the submerged frustum because the wave in the central plane propagates faster due to wave focusing after the frustum the wave crest plunges forward to overturn when passing the crest of the submerged frustum at t 1 8 s a three dimensional overturning wave can be observed in fig 8 c during wave overturning it is shown that the streamwise velocity u in the plunging jet is higher than the wave phase speed c which is consistent with the common sense criterion that u c 1 during wave breaking far from the central plane the streamwise velocity is less than the wave phase speed c and the wave propagates forward without breaking the vertical velocity w is positive on the front face of the wave and negative on the rear face and the tip of the plunging jet at this moment the overturning wave starts to curl down as it can be seen from the sign of the vertical velocity during wave overturning the spanwise velocity v in the plunging jet is very small and the highest spanwise velocity is located near the toe of the plunging jet on both sides at t 2 0 s fig 8 d the plunging jet curls down and impinges on the water surface ahead to generate the splash up and an air cavity is enclosed beneath the overturning jet during the wave splash up the breaking region gets wider as time increases when more of the wave plunges forward and it is apparent that u c 1 in the plunging jet and the subsequent splash up the vertical velocity w is different from that during wave overturning as the plunging jet moves downwards until it touches down the air water interface and it move upwards during the splash up process contrast to the spanwise velocity v in the plunging jet during wave overturning it changes significantly during wave splash up the shoulders of the plunging jet move away from the tip whereas the top of the plunging jet moves towards the central plane fig 9 shows detailed views of the overturning wave during and after wave breaking perspective side and front views are shown in the top bottom left and bottom right respectively a typical three dimensional overturning jet can be seen in fig 9 a during wave breaking and the width of the overturning jet is about half of the top diameter of the submerged frustum a tube is formed beneath the overturning wave during the splash up as shown in fig 9 b and the width of the overturning jet increases as more of the wave plunges forward it is worth noting that in a 3d overturning wave the air in the tube might escape in the spanwise directions which is different from a 2d case 4 2 3 velocity fields fig 10 shows the evolution of velocity vectors in two longitudinal y planes at three selected instants in time the velocity vectors are normalized by the wave phase speed c 2 17 m s the velocities in the central plane y 0 are shown on the top whereas the velocities near the edge of the computational domain y 3 9 are presented on the bottom when the wave approaches the submerged frustum fig 10 a there is nearly no change of the water surface between the centre and edge and thus the flow patterns in two planes are very similar apart from the area near the frustum recirculation of air flow can be clearly seen above the crest of the wave as the air is driven by the water when the wave arrives at the crest of the frustum fig 10 b due to wave focusing after the frustum the wave in the central plane moves faster and this is evident by comparing the water surface profiles and the velocities near the centre of the frustum up to this stage there is no significant change in the flow pattern near the edge plane during wave overturning over the submerged conical frustum fig 10 c large velocity vectors are observed beneath the plunging jet as the air tries to escape from the enclosed cavity the velocity vectors in the wave crest are nearly horizontal during wave breaking in contrast to the central plane the wave near the edge plane is moving with lower speed without wave breaking fig 11 shows velocity vectors in selected horizontal z planes in the water two instantaneous results when the wave approaches the frustum t 1 0 s and when the wave passes the frustum t 1 8 s are presented three z planes corresponding to the bottom z d 0 02 middle z d 0 14 and top z d 0 30 layers of the water are shown the wave is scattered by the submerged frustum as the water moves towards the sides in front of the frustum and towards the central plane in the lee side of the frustum it is worth noting that horizontal velocities increase from the bottom to the top layer of the water which might question the uniform horizontal velocity assumption in depth integrated models fig 12 shows velocity vectors of in selected cross sections or x planes from the front edge x 4 to the rear edge x 4 of the frustum during wave breaking at t 1 8 s the wave moves away from the frustum on the front side of the frustum x 4 to x 0 due to wave scattering whereas it moves towards the frustum on the rear side of the frustum x 2 and x 4 due to wave focusing the x 2 plane is near the crest of the wave and it is shown that large velocity vectors are located near the water surface as the wave overturns and curls down it is noted that the water moves upward on the front face of the wave x 4 whereas the water moves downwards on the back face of the wave x 4 to x 2 from the 3d velocity field it is shown that the velocities increase from the bottom to the water surface and large velocity vectors are located under the crest of the wave it is apparent that the wave is dominated by the longitudinal motion whilst spanwise motion is very weak the velocity is highest near the central plane and the maximum velocity vector is observed during wave overturning 4 2 4 energy dissipation and transfer the energy dissipation and transformation during the solitary wave run up on the conical island is quantified it is worth emphasizing that the total energy and its components are calculated for the entire computational domain rather than for a fixed volume of water over one wave length so the values of normalized energy may change according to the size of computational domain even if the size of frustum is constant the kinetic energy ke potential energy pe and total energy te are obtained as dean and dalrymple 1984 9 ke f 0 ρ u 2 v 2 w 2 2 d z d x d y 10 pe f 0 ρ g z d z d x d y f 0 ρ g z d z d x d y t 0 11 te pe ke in order to study the effect of the submerged frustum on water waves another simulation has been performed but for a flat bottom case no frustum fig 13 shows the time history of normalized energy for the overturning wave over the submerged conical frustum together with the corresponding energy when there is no frustum all energies increase up to t 1 0 s as the wave propagates into the computational domain and decrease after t 2 0 s as the wave leaves the domain when there is no frustum it is shown that the energies decrease slightly due to the viscous dissipation and the lines remain parallel hence there is no significant energy transfer between kinetic and potential energies with the submerged frustum present there is more energy dissipation compared to the case without frustum which is due to the wave breaking due to the bathymetry of the frustum kinetic energy is converted to potential energy when the wave approaches the frustum when the wave arrives at the top of the frustum potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy which attains its maximum value during wave breaking after wave breaking kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases slightly during the jet splash cycle 5 conclusions in this paper a large eddy simulation based two phase flow model has been employed to investigate 3d breaking solitary waves over emergent and submerged conical structures providing details of the wave overturning and post breaking processes in order to validate the model the propagation of a solitary wave over a

the submerged conical structure during wave propagation have been quantified this study demonstrates the capability of the present two phase flow model to predict 3d free surface flow and breaking waves over complex topography the model can act as a complementary approach to experimental investigations to gain further insight into the kinematics and dynamics of three dimensional breaking waves

21681,this paper studies the inclined take off control for a kind of morphing hybrid aerial underwater vehicles at the initial stage the hybrid aerial underwater vehicle could not achieve trim condition for the low speed then the altitude could have an obvious decrease during the take off process this could lead the vehicle to crashing into water to escape from the unbalanced stage an adaptive backstepping controller is designed to track the target angle of attack and the thrust is opened to maximum within limitation the radial basis function neural networks and parameter adaption are employed in order to deal with the time varying nonlinear variable sweep dynamics of the vehicle bisides the control input of the elevator deflection is easy to be saturated for the low initial velocity this is taken into account in the design of a constraint adaptive backstepping controller to prevent aggressive adaptions and to provide reliable input commands simulations are presented to

able to operate in air and in water respectively hybrid aerial underwater vehicles hauvs break through the single medium limitation which could operate in air and underwater seamlessly this unique capability results in a disruptive technology for both civil and military applications including air water search and rescue inspection repair and survey missions as demonstrated in the literatures

furthermore adaptive sliding mode controller and adaptive dynamic surface controller were developed with the added mass parameters uncertainty and external disturbances considered ma et al 2018 lu et al 2019 morphing hauvs especially the variable sweep wing configuration was adopted in mit lincoln lab fabian et al 2012 beihang university and imperial college london siddall et al 2017 however such morphing hauvs has not yet been realized in the success of the multidomain locomotion but partial success in water entry process or water exit process wang et al 2013 zufferey et al 2019 up to now there are few researches on the controller design for the multidomain locomotion of the morphing hauvs and the idea of this paper comes from the demand of the inclined take off control linear and nonlinear controllers had been designed for the variable sweep vehicles to keep stability during the morphing process wu et al 2017 ma et al 2018 however it has new demands for the inclined take off process of the morphing hauvs schematic illustration of the take off process is presented in fig 1 a morphing hauv whose folded wings shape is similar with a uav is accelerated underwater to achieve sufficient speed then it gets out of water and deploys wings to get lift for take off the velocity at the moment of fully water exit is the initial velocity for the inclined take off process determining the energy consumed underwater so low water exit speed is preferable for repeated water air transitions so the inclined take off controller in this paper is developed in the condition of low initial speed and insufficient aerial thrust this means that the vehicle may crash into water for lack of lift at the initial stage so the vehicle should keep at a pull up condition holding a big angle of attack aoa then it is a reasonable and preferable control strategy to track a target aoa and setting the thrust maximum within the limitiation and the risk of stall should be avoided feedback linearization and sliding mode control had been applied to achieve the take off control hu et al 2017 then minmum thrust which could guarrantee the successful take off had been calculated however the morphing process and parameters uncertainties were not considered especially the problem of control input saturation was not considered in this paper the radial basis function neural networks rbfnn and parameter adaption are employed to design an adaptive backstepping abs take off controller in order to deal with parameters uncertainty and external disturbances of the time varying morphing

which could be adjusted to arbitrary small of zero 3 2 the cabs controller the control input or the desired states may exceed the magnitude limitation these immoderate states or saturated control input would always lead to the tracking errors becoming larger which causes an aggressive adaptation in the adaptive laws so the saturation could make the closed loop unstable the saturation has not been considered in abs controller design in the cabs controller design the command filter which could incorporate magnitude limits on the control input and the desired states is used to eliminate the effects of the saturation as shown in fig 3 the definitions of tracking errors in the parameter adaptive laws are modified to compensate the effects of the command filter an additional advantage of the cabs controller is that it also eliminates the restriction to nonlinear systems of a lower triangular form so the term g 1 u does not have to be neglected during the controller design the tracking errors in eqn 8 are re defined as 30 z 1 x 1 y r z 2 x 2 x 2 r where x 2 r is the filtered state of α 1 the adaptive errors are modified as 31 z 1 z 1 χ 1 z 2 z 2 χ 2 where χ 1 χ 2 are the compensating variables for saturation when the desired state exceeds the filtered state χ i reduces z i until α 1 and u d have feasible values α 1 is modified into x 2 r 0 in order to compensate the error between the desired u 0 and the filtered u when u 0 bigger than u in the same way χ 1 is activated when x 2 r 0 bigger than x 2 r consequently the dynamic process of χ i is defined as 32 χ 1 k 1

errors which drive the adaptive laws are unaffected to guarantee the stability of the closed loop system 4 simulation results simulations are performed to verify the performance of the proposed controllers in the take off process the target aoa is set to be 10 to getting enough lift and to preventing stall caused by overshoot the thrust is set to be constant t 2000 n which would lead to a slow acceleration during the take off process the constraint on the elevator deflection is set to be 20 for the abs controller the control gains and adaptive gains are selected as k 1 2 k 2 20 σ 1 σ 2

process with initial velocity 15 m s and initial pitch angle 45 variation of the sweep angle is set to be η 90 e t for the rbfnn q 30 s 30 s γ 0 80 v 0 100 m s α 30 30 is set with 150 nodes the widths of the gaussian basis functions are set to be 0 5 initial weight values of the rbfnn are set to 0 as illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 the cabs controller has a better tracking ability than the abs controller for the abs controller the saturation is not considered in the controller design process so saturation lasts for the whole take off process which leads to severe change in the control input for the cabs controller the control input saturation only occurs in the initial stage then the saturation is eliminated during the take off process the biggest aoa approximates to 16 at the initial stage the change of aoa could not be controlled because the control input has been saturated as shown in fig 3 the change is mainly determined by the variable sweep dynamics and its initial conditions from the view of preventing stall the initial conditions should be limited in fig 6 the altitudes are increased from 0m to about 100m an obvious decrease occurs during 2 3s 4 7s which is caused by the low initial velocity and insufficient thrust this could lead to the vehicle crashing into the water if the decrease is bigger so it is preferred to have a big thrust so that the velocity could be increased fast to escape the unbalance stag in the condition that the thrust is limited the proposed take off strategy is reasonable to achieve lift to increasing the altitude fast the position and attitude of the hauv under the cabs controller during 0 5s is shown in fig 6 to present the inclined take off process clearly as shown in fig 7 the change of the velocities has the same trend which are accelerated from 15 m s to 55 m s for both controllers 5 conclusion this paper concentrates on the inclined take off control of a morphing hauv with insufficient aerial thrust the development of the proposed take off controllers are based on the vertical time varying morphing dynamics of the hauv the rbfnn and parameter adaption are employed to the abs take off controller in order to deal with the uncertainty of the variable sweep aerodynamic parameters and external disturbances furthermore the constraint of the elevator input is taken into account in the cabs take off controller to prevent the aggressive adaption and provide reliable input commands numerical simulations are performed that the cabs controller successfully overcomes the parameters uncertainty external disturbances and the control input saturation in future the water exit process and the inclined take off process would be researched together credit authorship contribution statement ma zongcheng conceptualization

21681,this paper studies the inclined take off control for a kind of morphing hybrid aerial underwater vehicles at the initial stage the hybrid aerial underwater vehicle could not achieve trim condition for the low speed then the altitude could have an obvious decrease during the take off process this could lead the vehicle to crashing into water to escape from the unbalanced stage an adaptive backstepping controller is designed to track the target angle of attack and the thrust is opened to maximum within limitation the radial basis function neural networks and parameter adaption are employed in order to deal with the time varying nonlinear variable sweep dynamics of the vehicle bisides the control input of the elevator deflection is easy to be saturated for the low initial velocity this is taken into account in the design of a constraint adaptive backstepping controller to prevent aggressive adaptions and to provide reliable input commands simulations are presented to varify the proposed controller keywords hauv inclined water exit take off control cabs 1 introduction aerial unmanned vehicles auvs and underwater autonomous vehicles uavs are greatly limited by being able to operate in air and in water respectively hybrid aerial underwater vehicles hauvs break through the single medium limitation which could operate in air and underwater seamlessly this unique capability results in a disruptive technology for both civil and military applications including air water search and rescue inspection repair and survey missions as demonstrated in the literatures kaja and akinsany 2014 yang et al 2015 siddall et al 2017 it is challenging that hauvs should accommodate the fluid inertia and drag encountered underwater without compromising the weight and lifting

which could be adjusted to arbitrary small of zero 3 2 the cabs controller the control input or the desired states may exceed the magnitude limitation these immoderate states or saturated control input would always lead to the tracking errors becoming larger which causes an aggressive adaptation in the adaptive laws so the saturation could make the closed loop unstable the saturation has not been considered in abs controller design in the cabs controller design the command filter which could incorporate magnitude limits on the control input and the desired states is used to eliminate the effects of the saturation as shown in fig 3 the definitions of tracking errors in the parameter adaptive laws are modified to compensate the effects of the command filter an additional advantage of the cabs controller is that it also eliminates the restriction to nonlinear systems of a lower triangular form so the term g 1 u does not have to be neglected during the controller design the tracking errors in eqn 8 are re defined as 30 z 1 x 1 y r z 2 x 2 x 2 r where x 2 r is the filtered state of α 1 the adaptive errors are modified as 31 z 1 z 1 χ 1 z 2 z 2 χ 2 where χ 1 χ 2 are the compensating variables for saturation when the desired state exceeds the filtered state χ i reduces z i until α 1 and u d have feasible values α 1 is modified into x 2 r 0 in order to compensate the error between the desired u 0 and the filtered u when u 0 bigger than u in the same way χ 1 is activated when x 2 r 0 bigger than x 2 r consequently the dynamic process of χ i is defined as 32 χ 1 k 1

errors which drive the adaptive laws are unaffected to guarantee the stability of the closed loop system 4 simulation results simulations are performed to verify the performance of the proposed controllers in the take off process the target aoa is set to be 10 to getting enough lift and to preventing stall caused by overshoot the thrust is set to be constant t 2000 n which would lead to a slow acceleration during the take off process the constraint on the elevator deflection is set to be 20 for the abs controller the control gains and adaptive gains are selected as k 1 2 k 2 20 σ 1 σ 2

of the gaussian basis functions are set to be 0 5 initial weight values of the rbfnn are set to 0 as illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 the cabs controller has a better tracking ability than the abs controller for the abs controller the saturation is not considered in the controller design process so saturation lasts for the whole take off process which leads to severe change in the control input for the cabs controller the control input saturation only occurs in the initial stage then the saturation is eliminated during the take off process the biggest aoa approximates to 16 at the initial stage the change of aoa could not be controlled because the control input has been saturated as shown in fig 3 the change is mainly determined by the variable sweep dynamics and its initial conditions from the view of preventing stall the initial conditions should be limited in fig 6 the altitudes are increased from 0m to about 100m an obvious decrease occurs during 2 3s 4 7s which is caused by the low initial velocity and insufficient thrust this could lead to the vehicle crashing into the water if the decrease is bigger so it is preferred to have a big thrust so that the velocity could be increased fast to escape the unbalance stag in the condition that the thrust is limited the proposed take off strategy is reasonable to achieve lift to increasing the altitude fast the position and attitude of the hauv under the cabs controller during 0 5s is shown in fig 6 to present the inclined take off process clearly as shown in fig 7 the change of the velocities has the same trend which are accelerated from 15 m s to 55 m s for both controllers 5 conclusion this paper concentrates on the inclined take off control of a morphing hauv with insufficient aerial thrust the development of the proposed take off controllers are based on the vertical time varying morphing dynamics of the hauv the rbfnn and parameter adaption are employed to the abs take off controller in order to deal with the uncertainty of the variable sweep aerodynamic parameters and external disturbances furthermore the constraint of the elevator input is taken into account in the cabs take off controller to prevent the aggressive adaption and provide reliable input commands numerical simulations are performed that the cabs controller successfully overcomes the parameters uncertainty external disturbances and the control input saturation in future the water exit process and the inclined take off process would be researched together credit authorship contribution statement ma zongcheng conceptualization

21682,mitigation of shipping noise is a topical issue in marine engineering because of the dramatic increase in the levels of anthropogenic underwater noise and its impact on marine life in recent years hydro acoustic research has focussed on the development of reliable methods for predicting underwater radiated noise urn due to cavitation which is known to be the dominant contribution to the overall radiated noise spectrum of ships above the cavitation inception threshold model scale measurements are currently considered the most reliable approach to study urn problems in marine engineering and are crucial for the verification and validation of numerical methods however their reliability is affected by several uncertainty sources for which suitable test procedures and post processing techniques are needed as a means to better understand the accuracy and reliability of underwater radiated noise measurements a round robin rr test programme for an open water propeller setup was organized within the community of practice noise of the hydrotesting forum with the aim of comparing results among several institutes i e university of genova unige university of newcastle unew nmri sspa kriso cnr inm and marin this paper reports an overview of the rr programme and compares the different approaches and results keywords propeller cavitation underwater noise model tests round robin 1 introduction the need for reducing levels of underwater noise in the oceans particularly in regions where ships and marine life come into proximity is a topical issue of marine engineering in this scenario a major challenge concerns the need to develop and validate reliable noise prediction and assessment tools to support cost effective evaluation of design about underwater radiated noise urn which is expected to become a key element in ensuring a ship s compliance with possible future mandatory regulations model scale tests are currently the most reliable approach for the prediction of the full scale urn nevertheless model scale tests are affected by several uncertainty sources which in many cases can significantly jeopardise their reliability as pointed out in tani et al 2019b a non exhaustive list includes i the effects of the acoustical response of the facility and reverberation see e g briancon et al 2013 and tani et al 2019c ii the influence of facility background noise iii the water quality iv the determination of the loading conditions i e advance ratio or mean thrust coefficient cavitation number v the correct simulation of the wake field and cavitation inception influencing cavitation extents and dynamics vi the procedure adopted to scale measured noise spectra to full scale see bark 1985 blake and sevik 1982 lövik 1981 vii the influence of instrumentation measurement procedures and setup within the research community on underwater noise measurements there is no universally adopted procedure for urn tests at model scale despite similar methods for installation test condition data acquisition and scaling being used the procedure adopted by each facility depends somewhat on the type size and available range of operating conditions this scenario has created the need to gain insight into the key aspects influencing the accuracy and reliability of urn measurements at model scale to evaluate the impact of different experimental facilities and test procedures on full scale noise predictions to this end the community of practice cop noise of the hydrotesting forum htf https www hydrotestingforum org which followed from the hydrotesting alliance european network of excellence has carried out a round robin rr test programme concerning the urn of a reference cavitating propeller the rr test programme involved different propeller scale factors and facility types and dimensions the present paper reports an overview of the rr programme along with a comparative analysis of the results in terms of cavitation extent and radiated noise the paper is organized as follows the description of the rr test programme is reported in section 2 together with an overview of the test facilities and the experimental setups the post processing procedure employed for noise data is documented in section 3 the results are discussed in section 4 focussing on cavitation in sub section 4 1 and noise in sub section 4 2 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 the round robin test campaign 2 1 propeller model the case study selected for the round robin programme is the five bladed fixed pitch propeller model of the research vessel the princess royal shown in fig 1 the detailed design parameters of the full scale propeller for each section along the radius are reported in table 1 while the complete blade section offset of the propeller is available in tani et al 2017 details of the previous experimental campaigns about this propeller model are reported in aktas et al 2016b lafeber and bosschers 2016 and tani et al 2019a four different propeller models have been used in the round robin campaign characterised by slightly different scale factors ranging from 3 to 3 5 as summarized in table 2 2 2 test matrix for the round robin campaign here presented an open water configuration i e uniform inflow was studied in order to address a relatively simple test case an arrangement with an inclined shaft was also included to address non stationary cavitation induced by oblique propeller inflow in the present paper only results of tests with the straight shaft configuration are reported and analysed for both shaft configurations straight and inclined shaft six operational conditions were considered these conditions are by different combinations of advance ratio j and cavitation number σ v as given in table 3 where 1 j v n d and 2 σ v p 0 ρ g h p v 0 5 ρ v 2 where v is the forward speed n and d are the propeller rotation rate and diameter ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the water head measured from the centre of the propeller disk p 0 and p v are the atmospheric pressure and vapour pressure respectively 2 3 facilities and testing procedures the previous sub section provides the description of the setup and operational conditions to be tested in the round robin campaign however due to differences in the characteristics of the facilities model propellers equipment and experimental approaches these test conditions were reproduced differently by each participant since the study of the effects of similar differences is one of the main aim of the round robin they are summarized hereafter according to the following categories facilities 2 3 1 cavitation testing procedures 2 3 2 water quality 2 3 3 hydrophone configurations 2 3 4 propeller arrangement 2 3 5 confined environment effects 2 3 6 2 3 1 facilities the round robin programme includes three major categories of testing facilities cavitation tunnels of small unige nmri unew and large size kriso sspa a free surface cavitation channel inm and a depressurised wave basin marin the main characteristics of the facilities and relevant dimensions are summarized in table 4 further details can be found in aktas et al 2016b felli et al 2010 hallander 2017 lafeber et al 2015 park et al 2016 sakamoto et al 2017 tani et al 2017 2 3 2 cavitation testing procedures when a propeller model is tested in a cavitation tunnel or in similar facilities its performances may be slightly different from a pure open water case resulting in a different correspondence between the advance ratio and the thrust and torque coefficients therefore defining the test conditions in terms of thrust coefficient or advance ratio may result in slightly different conditions round robin tests were undertaken at thrust coefficient identity i e k t 0 242 and k t 0 192 corresponding to j 0 4 and j 0 5 respectively as derived from towing tank measurements this approach was adopted by all the participants with the exception of sspa and kriso who performed the tests at j identity resulting in slightly higher propeller thrust in the case of tests carried out in the depressurised wave basin at marin both identities of the thrust coefficient and advance coefficient are satisfied simultaneously the operational conditions tested by each participant are described in terms of thrust coefficient k t and cavitation number based on the propeller tip tangential speed σ n in table 5 where 3 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 and 4 σ n σ v j 2 where t is propeller thrust slightly different values of the σ n were considered when the thrust coefficient identity resulted in an advance coefficient different from the nominal one as for instance for tests at cnr inm the lower value of k t for condition c1 in marin tests is due to an error in the setting of the rotation rate whereas the lower thrust measured by marin unige sspa and cnr inm for condition c3 is related to the thrust breakdown caused by the large cavitation extent for this condition this phenomenon is not observed by the other participants since in their cases only the nominal value at atmospheric condition was collected the required values of the propeller functioning parameters j or k t were achieved by different combinations of flow and propeller rotational speed according to the typical operational ranges of each facilities this together with the different scale factors used results in values of the reynolds number equation 5 ranging from a minimum of 1 11e 06 to a maximum of 2 32e 06 as reported in table 4 5 r e 0 7 c 0 7 v 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν where c 0 7 is the blade chord length at 0 7r r being the propeller radius and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid these differences implied also the adoption of special procedures for cavitation testing in some facilities to stimulate the transition to turbulent flow more specifically marin applied strips of carborundum grains on the leading edges of the propeller blades and sspa used a special paint to increase the surface roughness 2 3 3 water quality water quality accounts for the amount and size of cavitation nuclei that significantly influence cavitation inception and development and thus radiated noise korkut 1999 also the amount of dissolved gas may have a relevant effect on the bubble dynamics and collapse thus influencing the high frequency noise and acoustic wave propagation blake and sevik 1982 for the round robin programme all the participants with the exception of cnr inm assessed water quality measuring the amount of oxygen content unige unew nmri kriso or the total gas content marin sspa water quality parameters are summarized in table 6 a special solution consisting in an electrolysis grid is used at marin to generate a sufficient amount of nuclei for cavitation tests the grid is mounted about 1 8 m upstream of the propeller and its cross section is 0 4 0 4 m the wake disturbances induced by the grid are neglected being generally lower than 1 5 it must be noted that measurement of the solved gas content does not allow to derive the nuclei size spectrum hence it represents a qualitative indication of water quality actually a correlation exists between the nuclei size spectrum and the solved gas as stated also in billet et al 2002 but this correlation may depends on the characteristics of the facility meaning that a rigorous comparison of the water quality among different facilities is not possible on the basis of the solved gas content only 2 3 4 hydrophone configurations urn tests were performed using different hydrophone configurations according to facility characteristics and best related experience the locations of hydrophones with respect to the propeller are summarized in table 7 with the longitudinal coordinate positive downstream hydrophones mounted on streamlined supports or fins inside the test section were used by sspa hallander 2017 nmri sakamoto et al 2017 and cnr inm kriso and unew aktas et al 2016a placed hydrophones in acoustic water filled chambers of different sizes and characteristics a large anechoic chamber at kriso and a small steel cylinder at unew unige adopted a multi hydrophone configuration using two streamlined fins and one small acrylic glass chamber tani et al 2017 a different configuration was used in the depressurised wave basin of marin consisting of one hydrophone mounted on a mast raised from the bottom of the tank at 1 45 m below the free surface lafeber and lloyd 2017 marin s arrangement was the only one in which the propeller and the hydrophone were in relative motion 2 3 5 propeller arrangement propeller vortex dynamics is strongly influenced whether pushing or pulling configuration is adopted particularly for drift conditions felli and falchi 2018 this influence is supposed to affect the urn in order to minimise any uncertainty due to the adoption of different propeller arrangements it was decided to undertake all the tests with the propeller in pulling operation except for tests at cnr inm actually in this case it is planned to tests both the pulling and pushing configuration in order to investigate relevant effects however results are currently available only for the pushing configuration the most evident consequence of this is that hub vortex cavitation is present for tests at cnr inm while it is obviously not present in other facilities 2 3 6 confined environment effects the facility size and characteristics may affects noise propagation as well as the noise power emitted by the source these effects can be partially addressed by the use of transfer functions accounting for the facility specificity in the acoustic wave propagation for the present round robin programme four institutions adopted solutions accounting for confined environment effects unige sspa and cnr inm measured the transfer function following the ittc guidelines ittc 2017 whereas marin computed the lloyd s mirror effect using the method presented in ainslie 2010 free surface reflections being the major effect on noise propagation in the wave basin since noise is measured within the reverberation radius lafeber et al 2015 the approaches used by all the participants are summarized in table 8 2 4 post processing of noise data noise signals were acquired according to the standard procedure of each facility concerning the equipment used the sampling frequency and the acquisition time noise records were processed to obtain noise spectra in both narrowband and one third octave oto band representation to this end most participants employed methods based on the fast fourier transform fft each with its own choice of window type length and overlaps only unew directly acquired the signal in one third octave band using hardware filters the sound pressure levels spl are defined as follows 6 s p l 10 log 10 p r m s 2 p r e f 2 where p r m s is the root mean square of the sound pressure p t and p r e f 1 μ pa for underwater noise in order to identify the contribution of the cavitating propeller background noise correction is applied the background noise was measured by all the participants replacing the propeller with a dummy hub and running the facility at the same advance speed shaft rate and depressurisation level adopted for the tests with the propeller net noise levels are computed based on the signal to noise ratio s n r which is the difference between the total sound pressure levels s p l s n and the background sound pressure levels spl n snr 10 db no correction 7 s p l 10 log

spherical propagation correction which leads to radiated noise levels rnl as follows 9 r n l s p l s 20 log 10 r r r e f where r is the distance between the hydrophone and the propeller r r e f is the reference distance typically equal to 1 m alternatively distance normalization is implicitly accounted for using the transfer function t f to derive the source strength levels sl since the reference transmitting voltage response of the emitter is given at 1m 10 s l s p l s t f data processing proceeds in a slightly different manner in the dwb due to the changing distance between propeller and hydrophone during the measurement a data window is selected in which the propeller is close enough to the hydrophone such that reverberation effects are negligible this window is subsequently divided into 15 segments using 50 overlap for which the source level is determined by applying spherical spreading loss and correcting for the lloyd s mirror effect based on the window s position relative to the hydrophone the background noise correction is then also applied per segment with the final source level obtained by averaging the results from all segments a full description of the procedures used at marin for processing of urn measurements can be found in lloyd et al 2018 2 5 extrapolation to full scale in order to compare all the results of the round robin campaign noise spectra are scaled to a common condition as specified below d s 0 75 m n s 19 025 rps σ n s 1 06 where d s is the diameter of the full scale propeller and n s and σ n s are the propeller rotational speed and the

where δ f is the bandwidth must be subtracted 3 results in this section results of the round robin programme are analysed comparing measurements among the participants since all the institutions involved addressed the same physical problem ideally they should obtain the same results within reasonable measurement uncertainties consequently this expectation is verified and observed deviation from it are highlighted and discussed in order to identify possible causes in relation with the different facilities setups and equipment employed the analysis focusses at first on cavitation extents considering some examples of available observations successively in subsection 4 2 results of noise measurements are analysed in detail 3 1 cavitation extents before comparing propeller cavitation extents observed by the different participants cavitation patterns for all the loading conditions are presented for one participant only to exemplify the typical cavitation patterns for this purpose the cavitation observed at sspa is shown in fig 2 from the analysis of reported pictures it is possible to make general observations about cavitation patterns present for the loading conditions considered in the round robin programme 1 only suction side cavitation is present consisting of the leading edge vortex and sheet cavitation 2 sorting the operational conditions concerning the increased sheet cavitation extent the following result is obtained c4 c5 c1 c6 c2 and c3 3 sorting the operational conditions with respect to increasing vortex cavitation extent the following result is obtained c4 c3 c5 c1 c6 and c2 4 conditions c1 c2 c5 and c6 are characterised by similar cavitation phenomena and dynamics differing only for the extent of phenomena 5 condition c4 is characterised by the presence of a weak tip vortex very close to inception 6 condition c3 is characterised by rather large sheet cavitation generating cloud cavitation at trailing edge the cavitating core of the tip vortex is disrupted in place of it cloudy vertical structures are present featuring a somewhat unstable behaviour a smaller vortex is generated at the trailing edge of the sheet cavity where the cavity reaches the blade trailing edge these comments hold for tests carried out by all the participants with only the following few exceptions the differences between cavitation extents observed at nmri for j 0 4 c1 c2 and c3 and j 0 5 c4 c5 c6 seem reduced the tip vortex in condition c4 is more stable than in other institutions whereas the sheet cavity in condition c3 is reduced the reasons for these discrepancies may lie in the cavitation numbers adopted for tests which are slightly different from the nominal values see table 5 sheet cavitation observed at kriso for condition c3 is less extended than that observed by other participants while the tip vortex is larger the reason for this is that it was not possible to achieve the very low cavitation number of condition c3 at kriso using the setup adopted hence c3 condition at kriso is characterised by a higher about 50 cavitation number see table 5 hub vortex cavitation was observed for all the loading conditions at cnr inm as already mentioned this phenomenon is not observed in the results from the other facilities because of the adopted propeller configuration the direct comparison of cavitation patterns observed within the round robin programme is shown in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 for conditions c1 c3 and c4 respectively a fair agreement is observed in most cases besides the anomalies already mentioned differences for conditions c1 and c3 mainly concern the extent of the sheet cavitation toward the inner radii sheet cavitation for condition c1 starts around 0 7r for marin unew and sspa around 0 75r for kriso and 0 8 for unige nmri and cnr inm sheet cavitation for condition c3 starts at about 0 3r for marin and sspa 0 6r for unew and unige 0 65 for kriso 0 7 for cnr inm and 0 8 for nmri analysing differences in terms of chordwise elongation and thickness of sheet cavitation is even more difficult because of differences in the observation angles generally the chordwise extent of cavitation for condition c1 is approximately 10 of the chord at inner radii reaching 100 of the chord around 0 95r differently the radial positions where the sheet cavity reaches the trailing edge can be compared for condition c3 this occurs at about 0 65r for marin and sspa 0 7r for unige unew and cnr inm and 0 85r for kriso and nmri finally considering condition c4 a very small tip vortex is visible in the unige marin and unew observations similar cavitation was also present at sspa kriso and cnr inm even if it was not captured in photographs because of its intermittent nature the largest extent of tip vortex at nmri for this condition is due to the different cavitation number adopted from this qualitative analysis it can be concluded that the cavitation observed by the participants is very similar in terms of typology and dynamics with only a few exceptions for the condition with the largest cavitation i e c3 differences in terms of the extent of the sheet cavity are small but non negligible for most conditions the largest differences are observed for the condition with the largest cavitation i e c3 discrepancies mostly concern the extent of the sheet cavity at the inner radii as already remarked the largest discrepancies observed may be ascribed to the small differences in the operational conditions used among the various facilities for certain tests mainly in terms of cavitation number and to the different configuration used at cnr inm further differences especially those concerning the extent of sheet cavitation at inner propeller radii are likely related to the development of the boundary layer on the blades which may vary depending on the reynolds number adopted during tests and on the specific approach used for turbulence stimulation if applied furthermore cavitation at the leading edge may be influenced also by other effects such as the freestream turbulence in the facilities the blade geometry finishing and the water quality the latter is not expected to have significant effects for condition c3 since in this case cavitation is fully developed contributing in the creation of new cavitation nuclei recirculating in the flow this does not hold for the depressurised wave basin conversely different water quality may contribute to the small differences observed in the development of the weak tip vortex for condition c4 3 2 radiated noise the main results of the round robin programme are comparisons of noise measurements carried out by the different participants the comparison of one third octave noise spectra is reported in fig 6 these full scale spectra are obtained by scaling all the measurements according to the procedure described in section 3 as previously mentioned transfer functions are not available for all the participants therefore results include rnl and sl spectra depending on the availability of transfer functions or other corrections however all results will be referred as sl in the following since both quantities represent the same outcome obtained with different approximations on the confined environment effect some anomalous peaks are present in the spectra caused by the presence of significant tonal noise disturbances not cancelled by the background noise correction e g propeller singing structural vibrations shaft line noise this phenomenon may be explained considering that the intensity of some background noise components is larger when the propeller is present therefore the subtraction of the background noise measured without the propeller does not allow cancelling these noise disturbances disregarding the frequency bands containing peaks a band of variation of about 10 db of predicted noise levels is observed on average rising to about 20 db for conditions c3 and c4 results of this overall comparison depend on the considered frequency range high frequency noise above 2 3 khz higher levels were measured at sspa kriso and cnr inm while the lowest levels are in most cases those measured at unige and marin low frequency noise below 2 3 khz higher noise levels were measured at sspa unige and for some conditions nmri kriso and cnr inm the agreement in this frequency range is slightly better even if there are always some spectra deviating from the most common behaviour for most of the conditions tested similarities among the results obtained by the different participants can be observed however the magnitude of the spread measured noise levels is generally rather large as a reference the uncertainty levels estimated for ships noise predictions based on model tests are commonly expected to be 3 5 db according to ittc 2017 a spread of noise data within the round robin campaign comparable with the uncertainty on measurements could be reasonably accepted whereas a significantly larger spread requires further investigation noise spectra are characterised by complex shapes with many features that are not always directly related to the physics of the noise source analysed these include the tonal noise disturbances already mentioned propagation effects hydrophones responses and possible noise absorption caused by free bubbles amongst others nevertheless comparing most of the spectra with the theoretical spectra of cavitation noise see for example blake and sevik 1982 blake 1986 and fitzpatrick and strasberg 1956 some common features may be observed in many cases the continuous part of the cavitation noise spectrum is characterised by the presence of a hump at a medium low frequency whose amplitude and prominence depend on cavitation typology and dynamics this hump usually represents the peak in the broadband spectrum moving to higher frequencies noise levels vary with a certain constant power of the reciprocal of the frequency in some cases two different frequency ranges may be observed with different decay ratios the decay slope typically increases with increasing frequency it is possible to identify the main features of this theoretical cavitation noise spectra as illustrated in fig 7 the analysis of the main characteristics of this schematic spectrum may provide a more in depth insight into the physics of the problem the features that are more directly related to the dynamics of cavitation are the central frequency amplitude width and power content of the spectral hump and the energy content and decay ratio of the high frequency part of the spectrum the hump is associated with low frequency dynamics of cavities such as the pulsation of the tip vortex terwisga et al 2007 or the growth and initial stage of the collapse of cavities fitzpatrick and strasberg 1956 the high frequency spectrum and its characteristics are instead associated with the dynamics and the size of small cavitation bubbles shed by cavitation with the final stage of cavity collapse and with the generation of shock waves from a practical point of view a schematic representation based on piecewise linear functions as shown in the example in fig 7 is used to define the main characteristics of spectra for further analyses in this work the analysis is focused on the following parameters fpeak and slpeak frequency and level of the peak in the schematic spectrum khf decay ratio of the spectrum computed at 10 khz slhf power content between 3 khz and 12 5 khz computed integrating the power spectral density keeping in mind the approximations concerning the definition and fitting of the schematic spectrum onto the real spectra these parameters are analysed in fig 8 and fig 10 which are dedicated to the hump and the high frequency spectrum respectively results from unew are not included in present analysis because of the complex shape of spectra measured in this facility and because narrowband spectra which allow identifying the characteristics analysed are not available starting with the hump characteristics these may be reasonably associated with vortex dynamics for present cases actually when significant tip vortex cavitation is present without major collapses as in the round robin programme the volume pulsation of the vortex around the natural frequency may characterise the radiated noise spectrum producing the prominent peaks observed in current measurements the resonance frequency of a cavitating vortex may be analysed considering the dispersion relation for waves travelling on the cavity surfaces this relation under some hypotheses on the deformation mode generating noise may also provide a relationship between the resonance frequency of the vortex cavity and its dimensions see bosschers 2008 bosschers 2018 and pennings et al 2015 accordingly the analysis of the hump central frequency may provide interesting information on the size of tip vortex cavitation values reported on the left side of fig 8 show a rather good agreement between unige marin kriso sspa and cnr inm while the trend observed at nmri is completely different the anomalous behaviour of the hump in the nmri spectra may be due to the fact that the identified hump is probably not related to tip vortex noise whereas the spectral hump corresponding to vortex pulsation is not clearly detectable this conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the peak levels and other characteristics of the hump e g the width which present similar anomalous trends focussing on the other participants the following main comments may be made considering j 0 4 i e c1 c2 and c3 the hump centre frequency decreases from c1 to c2 where the minimum is observed while it increases for condition c3 this trend is consistent with cavitation extents since the dimensions of the cavitating vortices increase from c1 to c2 where the largest vortices are observed for condition c3 the main vortex is disrupted while a second weaker vortex is present causing the hump at a higher frequency with respect to c1 and c2 condition c3 at kriso was reproduced with a slightly higher cavitation number causing a different cavitation extent and dynamics as already discussed in section 4 1 the resulting vortex exhibits a cavitating core slightly larger compared to condition c2 without any secondary vortex this agrees rather well with the decrease of the hump frequency from condition c2 to c3 observed at kriso considering j 0 5 i e c4 c5 and c6 the maximum hump frequency is observed in correspondence to condition c4 which is consistent with the very small dimensions of the tip vortex for this condition moving to conditions c5 and c6 the hump frequency decreases again which is in good agreement with the increasing cavitating radius sorting the central frequency values for a given participant in decreasing order the result agrees with the tip vortex dimensions qualitatively observed in section 4 1 based on these observations and as long as the peak frequency may be considered representative of the vortex pulsation frequency the agreement observed in terms of vortex dynamics is better than that inferable from the overall comparison of noise spectra in fact in most cases the range of variation is below 100 hz with few exceptions observed in the measurements performed at kriso which are likely due to the small differences in the operational conditions as already remarked moving to the analysis of the peak levels the comparison is more complicated and the agreement within participants results is relatively worse nevertheless common trends are present minimum levels are observed for condition c4 for which the vortex is just past inception noise levels increase significantly from condition c4 to c5 and c6 except for c6 at kriso and nmri whose hump interpretation is doubtful as already remarked the trend is more complicated considering conditions with j 0 4 and lower differences are observed among conditions c1 c2 and c3 than among c4 c5 and c6 j 0 5 two main trends are observed considering unige and sspa measurements the peak level increases passing from c1 to c2 while it remains almost constant passing from c2 to c3 considering marin nmri and cnr inm results instead the peak level decreases passing from c1 to c2 while the level for c3 is again very similar to that observed for c1 sorting the peak levels for a given participant in increasing order the results are different depending on the selected participant and generally it is more difficult to correlate the obtained order with that of vortex dimensions the spread in results is in most cases of about 10 db except for condition c4 which shows larger variation due to incipient and intermittent cavitation this general value is significant but probably lower than the overall spread observed from the global analysis of the spectra in summary the interpretation of peak levels is more complex than peak frequency the complex trends observed for the peak levels may be due to different causes the identification of the spectral hump may be not correct in some cases its interpretation as the noise associated with tip vortex pulsation may be not completely correct or consistent on the other hand differences in noise levels may be related to other effects not concerning the characteristics of the noise source such as the acoustic response of the facility sensors etc in order to investigate the possible causes of differences in the spectral hump the available data on the central frequency and peak levels are compared assuming that the central frequency of the hump is only influenced by the size of cavitating vortices if the differences among peak levels are consistent with the differences among central frequency it could be concluded that global differences in the spectral hump are caused by different vortex diameters among the participants however the direct comparison of frequencies and noise levels is not meaningful thus a different approach is exploited as previously mentioned formulations exist describing the relation between the pulsation frequency of a cavitating vortex and its radius similarly semi empirical formulations for the amplitude of the vortex peak are available among these formulations those proposed in bosschers 2018 are considered in the present work defined as 13 r c c 1 n d σ n f p e a k and 14 r c c 2 d p p e a k ρ n 2 d 2 z 2 k where f b p n z is the blade passage frequency z the blades number p p e a k 10 s l p e a k 20 p r e f is the acoustic pressure correspondent to s l p e a k and r c the cavity radius the constants c 1 and c 2 and the exponent k should be found based on the fitting with experimental data in the present work k 3 is assumed according to the findings of bosschers 2018 the procedure needed to find constants c 1 and c 2 would require the use of a vortex model to compute r c based on the propeller blade loading and a significant amount of experimental data possibly including many more loading conditions than those considered in the round robin programme however such a procedure is not required for the aims of current analyses since interesting information may be derived simply from the analysis of relative trends consequently a different approach is used the vortex cavitating radii r c f p e a k corresponding to measured central frequencies are computed with equation 13 and the resulting values normalised dividing them by the maximum value over the dataset the result of this normalization does not depend on the constant c 1 whose knowledge is no more required analogously the radii r c s l p e a k are derived from equation 14 and normalised in the same way the resulting values of r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k for all the six loading conditions are reported in fig 9 further comments can be made from the direct comparison of r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k first the spread of central frequencies and peak level is analysed omitting the anomalous values observed in the measurements by nmri considering condition c1 as an example the values of r c f p e a k lie between about 45 and 60 of the maximum while the values of r c s l p e a k are between about 57 and 81 hence exhibiting a slightly larger spread however moving to condition c2 the ranges of these variations are from 63 to 100 for r c f p e a k and from 69 to 100 for r c s l p e a k extending this comparison to all the operational conditions it can be concluded that generally the spread among the data is similar for what concerns frequencies and peak levels apparently suggesting that these discrepancies may be caused by the same phenomena however the observed trends for r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k are in general not consistent comparing two different loading conditions for a given participant r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k show the opposite behaviour in some cases e g compare c1 and c2 for marin results c2 and c3 for kriso or the propeller loading has a significantly different effect on r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k e g compare c2 and c3 for unige and sspa similar discrepancies are observed comparing results among different participants for a given loading condition in summary this analysis indicates that the differences in terms of cavitation extents among the participants are appreciable and may contribute to the spread of noise data however other analyses should also be made to explain the spread of data as well as the inconsistency observed in terms of relative trends in order to complete the analysis of noise results the high frequency part of the spectrum is considered this portion of the spectrum is mainly related to the collapse of cavities for uniform inflow conditions the main cavities show an almost stationary behaviour hence collapses mainly concern the small cavities shed from both sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation therefore the intensity and frequency content of the high frequency noise should depend on the amount frequency and intensity of collapses which are related to cavitation extents and other aspects influencing bubble dynamics such as the presence of non condensable gas and fluid compressibility analysing the average decay ratio of the high frequency spectrum reported on the left side plot of fig 10 most values are between 10 and 20 db per decade in good agreement with data on cavitation noise available in the literature ceccio and brennen 1991 the spread of results is again appreciable and it seems difficult to detect common trends the analysis of the decay ratio at a given frequency allows only partial comparison of the characteristics of the high frequency noise spectrum as clearly visible in the examples shown in fig 7 this frequency i e 10 khz is either lower or higher than the frequency that divides the two spectral parts with different decay slopes of the schematized spectrum this fact complicates the interpretation of this quantity which is not probably an effective parameter to describe results according to the aims of the present work finally the right plot in fig 10 reports the sound pressure level computed over a wide frequency range defined in such a way as to represent the power content of the high frequency spectrum for all the participants the spread of values is significant differences of 10 db on average are observed for the conditions characterised by intermediate cavitation i e c1 c2 c5 and c6 while even 20 db differences are observed between the highest and lowest measured levels for conditions c3 and c4 the latter conditions being characterised by very large cavitation and incipient cavitation respectively are relatively more sensitive to possible differences among the experiments carried out by the participants therefore it is not completely surprising to observe a larger spread of results for such conditions however the magnitude of the spread of data for both intermediate and extreme cavitation cases is remarkable focussing instead on the trends concerning propeller loading conditions some similarities are detectable with only a few exceptions the main common features are the high frequency noise increases from condition c1 to c3 and from c4 to c6 the high frequency noise is higher for j 0 4 for which more sheet cavitation is present compared to j 0 5 maximum and minimum noise levels are measured for condition c3 and c4 respectively except nmri which is in good agreement with the observed cavitation patterns sorting the high frequency noise levels for a given participant in increasing order the results partially agree with the sheet cavitation extent in most cases noise levels for the intermediate cavitation conditions c1 c2 c5 and c6 are rather similar summarising the above comments the trend of the high frequency noise levels analysed for a given participant agrees rather well with the observed cavitation extent in general higher levels are measured when the propeller loading is higher with consequently larger sheet cavitation however comparing different participants results do not always correlate with observed cavitation extent the analyses presented focussing on noise levels for a single frequency band or on the level of the peak as in fig 8 allow appreciation of how noise levels vary with respect to propeller loading conditions for each participant it can be concluded that differences in noise levels found by each participant when modifying propeller loading conditions at least limited to intermediate cavitation conditions i e c1 c2 c5 and c6 are comparable and in many cases lower than the differences among the results obtained by the different participants for the same propeller loading condition 4 conclusions results of the round robin campaign on propeller noise measurements at model scale carried out by the noise community of practice of the hydrotesting forum are analysed cavitation patterns observed within the round robin programme are generally very similar in terms of phenomena extent and dynamics several discrepancies do exist however many reasons may contribute to these differences among which the most important are the small differences in the definition of the operational conditions and the development of the boundary layer on propeller blades furthermore possible differences in the geometries of propeller models could play a role and should be analysed in the future the analysis of noise results highlighted the significant spread of data even when trying to neglect the effects of unwanted noise components some important comments may be made based on the analysis of the main characteristics of the noise spectra namely the frequency and the peak level of the medium low frequency hump and the decay ratio and power content of the high frequency noise common trends were observed for all the considered characteristics a rather good agreement is present in terms of the centre frequency of the spectral hump which is most highly associated with the noise generated by tip vortex cavitation the values of the frequencies correlate rather well also with observed extents of vortex cavitation the peak levels of the medium low frequency hump correlate worse with cavitation extent even if the dependency of this quantity on propeller loading showed some similarities for each participant discrepancies are present and it is more difficult to recognise a common trend these comments are confirmed by the comparison of tip vortex cavitating radii derived from measured central frequency and peak levels of the spectral hump by means of semi empirical formulations the spread of results is similar but relative trends are in many cases not consistent the decay slope of the high frequency spectrum is rather different for each participant although most values lay within values reported in the literature for cavitation noise however due to the different frequency range available for each participant it is difficult to make a fair comparison of high frequency spectrum slope the power content of the high frequency noise is characterised by a significant spread even if some common trends are observed in terms of dependency of the noise levels on propeller loading conditions differences observed in terms of noise levels comparing all the propeller loading conditions characterised by moderate cavitation for a given participant are comparable or even lower than differences observed comparing measurements carried out by all the participants for a given loading condition in summary the comparison of results obtained within the round robin programme highlights the need for further studies aiming at explaining such large discrepancies in view of this the analyses reported here already provide some useful indications some differences among the experiments carried out by the participants to the round robin programme also exist in terms of the definition of propeller loading conditions and cavitation extents however these differences are not expected to cause the large discrepancies that are observed among the noise data observed cavitation is always characterised by the same dynamic behaviour and similar extents also the analysis of the central frequency of the spectral hump suggests that vortex dynamics are similar for most of the participants finally the overall analysis of the effects of the loading conditions on measured noise confirms that these effects are not sufficient to explain the large dispersion of data and the inconsistent trends observed based on these conclusions further aspects will be investigated in the future not only concerning the development of cavitation but also the generation propagation acquisition and processing of noise data including the following main aspects effects of water quality on noise generation and propagation effects of the acoustic response of the facility effects of the oblique flow effects of the adoption of different scaling laws to compare results of the round robin campaign credit authorship contribution statement giorgio tani

21682,mitigation of shipping noise is a topical issue in marine engineering because of the dramatic increase in the levels of anthropogenic underwater noise and its impact on marine life in recent years hydro acoustic research has focussed on the development of reliable methods for predicting underwater radiated noise urn due to cavitation which is known to be the dominant contribution to the overall radiated noise spectrum of ships above the cavitation inception threshold model scale measurements are currently considered the most reliable approach to study urn problems in marine engineering and are crucial for the verification and validation of numerical methods however their reliability is affected by several uncertainty sources for which suitable test procedures and post processing techniques are needed as a means to better understand the accuracy and reliability of underwater radiated noise measurements a round robin rr test programme for an open water propeller setup was organized within the community of practice noise of the hydrotesting forum with the aim of comparing results among several institutes i e university of genova unige university of newcastle unew nmri sspa kriso cnr inm and marin this paper reports an overview of the rr programme and compares the different approaches and results keywords propeller cavitation underwater noise model tests round robin 1 introduction the need for reducing levels of underwater noise in the oceans particularly in regions where ships and marine life come into proximity is a topical issue of marine engineering in this scenario a major challenge concerns the need to develop and validate reliable noise prediction and assessment tools to support cost effective evaluation of design about underwater radiated noise urn which is expected to become a key element in ensuring a ship s compliance with possible future mandatory regulations model scale tests are currently the most reliable approach for the prediction of the full scale urn nevertheless model scale tests are affected by several uncertainty sources which in many cases can significantly jeopardise their reliability as pointed out in tani et al 2019b a non exhaustive list includes i the effects of the acoustical response of the facility and reverberation see e g briancon et al 2013 and tani et al 2019c ii the influence of facility background noise iii the water quality iv the determination of the loading conditions i e advance ratio or mean thrust coefficient cavitation number v the correct simulation of the wake field and cavitation inception influencing cavitation extents and dynamics vi the procedure adopted to scale measured noise spectra to full scale see bark 1985 blake and sevik 1982 lövik 1981 vii the influence of instrumentation measurement procedures and setup within the research community on underwater noise measurements there is no universally adopted procedure for urn tests at model scale despite similar methods for installation test condition data acquisition and scaling being used the procedure adopted by each facility depends somewhat on the type size and available range of operating conditions this scenario has created the need to gain insight into the key aspects influencing the accuracy and reliability of urn measurements at model scale to evaluate the impact of different experimental facilities and test procedures on full scale noise predictions to this end the community of practice cop noise of the hydrotesting forum htf https www hydrotestingforum org which followed from the hydrotesting alliance european network of excellence has carried out a round robin rr test programme concerning the urn of a reference cavitating propeller the rr test programme involved different propeller scale factors and facility types and dimensions the present paper reports an overview of the rr programme along with a comparative analysis of the results in terms of cavitation extent and radiated noise the paper is organized as follows the description of the rr test programme is reported in section 2 together with an overview of the test facilities and the experimental setups the post processing procedure employed for noise data is documented in section 3 the results are discussed in section 4 focussing on cavitation in sub section 4 1 and noise in sub section 4 2 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 the round robin test campaign 2 1 propeller model the case study selected for the round robin programme is the five bladed fixed pitch propeller model of the research vessel the princess royal shown in fig 1 the detailed design parameters of the full scale propeller for each section along the radius are reported in table 1 while the complete blade section offset of the propeller is available in tani et al 2017 details of the previous experimental campaigns about this propeller model are reported in aktas et al 2016b lafeber and bosschers 2016 and tani et al 2019a four different propeller models have been used in the round robin campaign characterised by slightly different scale factors ranging from 3 to 3 5 as summarized in table 2 2 2 test matrix for the round robin campaign here presented an open water configuration i e uniform inflow was studied in order to address a relatively simple test case an arrangement with an inclined shaft was also included to address non stationary cavitation induced by oblique propeller inflow in the present paper only results of tests with the straight shaft configuration are reported and analysed for both shaft configurations straight and inclined shaft six operational conditions were considered these conditions are by different combinations of advance ratio j and cavitation number σ v as given in table 3 where 1 j v n d and 2 σ v p 0 ρ g h p v 0 5 ρ v 2 where v is the forward speed n and d are the propeller rotation rate and diameter ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the water head measured from the centre of the propeller disk p 0 and p v are the atmospheric pressure and vapour pressure respectively 2 3 facilities and testing procedures the previous sub section provides the description of the setup and operational conditions to be tested in the round robin campaign however due to differences in the characteristics of the facilities model propellers equipment and experimental approaches these test conditions were reproduced differently by each participant since the study of the effects of similar differences is one of the main aim of the round robin they are summarized hereafter according to the following categories facilities 2 3 1 cavitation testing procedures 2 3 2 water quality 2 3 3 hydrophone configurations 2 3 4 propeller arrangement 2 3 5 confined environment effects 2 3 6 2 3 1 facilities the round robin programme includes three major categories of testing facilities cavitation tunnels of small unige nmri unew and large size kriso sspa a free surface cavitation channel inm and a depressurised wave basin marin the main characteristics of the facilities and relevant dimensions are summarized in table 4 further details can be found in aktas et al 2016b felli et al 2010 hallander 2017 lafeber et al 2015 park et al 2016 sakamoto et al 2017 tani et al 2017 2 3 2 cavitation testing procedures when a propeller model is tested in a cavitation tunnel or in similar facilities its performances may be slightly different from a pure open water case resulting in a different correspondence between the advance ratio and the thrust and torque coefficients therefore defining the test conditions in terms of thrust coefficient or advance ratio may result in slightly different conditions round robin tests were undertaken at thrust coefficient identity i e k t 0 242 and k t 0 192 corresponding to j 0 4 and j 0 5 respectively as derived from towing tank measurements this approach was adopted by all the participants with the exception of sspa and kriso who performed the tests at j identity resulting in slightly higher propeller thrust in the case of tests carried out in the depressurised wave basin at marin both identities of the thrust coefficient and advance coefficient are satisfied simultaneously the operational conditions tested by each participant are described in terms of thrust coefficient k t and cavitation number based on the propeller tip tangential speed σ n in table 5 where 3 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 and 4 σ n σ v j 2 where t is propeller thrust slightly different values of the σ n were considered when the thrust coefficient identity resulted in an advance coefficient different from the nominal one as for instance for tests at cnr inm the lower value of k t for condition c1 in marin tests is due to an error in the setting of the rotation rate whereas the lower thrust measured by marin unige sspa and cnr inm for condition c3 is related to the thrust breakdown caused by the large cavitation extent for this condition this phenomenon is not observed by the other participants since in their cases only the nominal value at atmospheric condition was collected the required values of the propeller functioning parameters j or k t were achieved by different combinations of flow and propeller rotational speed according to the typical operational ranges of each facilities this together with the different scale factors used results in values of the reynolds number equation 5 ranging from a minimum of 1 11e 06 to a maximum of 2 32e 06 as reported in table 4 5 r e 0 7 c 0 7 v 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν where c 0 7 is the blade chord length at 0 7r r being the propeller radius and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid these differences implied also the adoption of special procedures for cavitation testing in some facilities to stimulate the transition to turbulent flow more specifically marin applied strips of carborundum grains on the leading edges of the propeller blades and sspa used a special paint to increase the surface roughness 2 3 3 water quality water quality accounts for the amount and size of cavitation nuclei that significantly influence cavitation inception and development and thus radiated noise korkut 1999 also the amount of dissolved gas may have a relevant effect on the bubble dynamics and collapse thus influencing the high frequency noise and acoustic wave propagation blake and sevik 1982 for the round robin programme all the participants with the exception of cnr inm assessed water quality measuring the amount of oxygen content unige unew nmri kriso or the total gas content marin sspa water quality parameters are summarized in table 6 a special solution consisting in an electrolysis grid is used at marin to generate a sufficient amount of nuclei for cavitation tests the grid is mounted about 1 8 m upstream of the propeller and its cross section is 0 4 0 4 m the wake disturbances induced by the grid are neglected being generally lower than 1 5 it must be noted that measurement of the solved gas content does not allow to derive the nuclei size spectrum hence it represents a qualitative indication of water quality actually a correlation exists between the nuclei size spectrum and the solved gas as stated also in billet et al 2002 but this correlation may depends on the characteristics of the facility meaning that a rigorous comparison of the water quality among different facilities is not possible on the basis of the solved gas content only 2 3 4 hydrophone configurations urn tests were performed using different hydrophone configurations according to facility characteristics and best related experience the locations of hydrophones with respect to the propeller are summarized in table 7 with the longitudinal coordinate positive downstream hydrophones mounted on streamlined supports or fins inside the test section were used by sspa hallander 2017 nmri sakamoto et al 2017 and cnr inm kriso and unew aktas et al 2016a placed hydrophones in acoustic water filled chambers of different sizes and characteristics a large anechoic chamber at kriso and a small steel cylinder at unew unige adopted a multi hydrophone configuration using two streamlined fins and one small acrylic glass chamber tani et al 2017 a different configuration was used in the depressurised wave basin of marin consisting of one hydrophone mounted on a mast raised from the bottom of the tank at 1 45 m below the free surface lafeber and lloyd 2017 marin s arrangement was the only one in which the propeller and the hydrophone were in relative motion 2 3 5 propeller arrangement propeller vortex dynamics is strongly influenced whether pushing or pulling configuration is adopted particularly for drift conditions felli and falchi 2018 this influence is supposed to affect the urn in order to minimise any uncertainty due to the adoption of different propeller arrangements it was decided to undertake all the tests with the propeller in pulling operation except for tests at cnr inm actually in this case it is planned to tests both the pulling and pushing configuration in order to investigate relevant effects however results are currently available only for the pushing configuration the most evident consequence of this is that hub vortex cavitation is present for tests at cnr inm while it is obviously not present in other facilities 2 3 6 confined environment effects the facility size and characteristics may affects noise propagation as well as the noise power emitted by the source these effects can be partially addressed by the use of transfer functions accounting for the facility specificity in the acoustic wave propagation for the present round robin programme four institutions adopted solutions accounting for confined environment effects unige sspa and cnr inm measured the transfer function following the ittc guidelines ittc 2017 whereas marin computed the lloyd s mirror effect using the method presented in ainslie 2010 free surface reflections being the major effect on noise propagation in the wave basin since noise is measured within the reverberation radius lafeber et al 2015 the approaches used by all the participants are summarized in table 8 2 4 post processing of noise data noise signals were acquired according to the standard procedure of each facility concerning the equipment used the sampling frequency and the acquisition time noise records were processed to obtain noise spectra in both narrowband and one third octave oto band representation to this end most participants employed methods based on the fast fourier transform fft each with its own choice of window type length and overlaps only unew directly acquired the signal in one third octave band using hardware filters the sound pressure levels spl are defined as follows 6 s p l 10 log 10 p r m s 2 p r e f 2 where p r m s is the root mean square of the sound pressure p t and p r e f 1 μ pa for underwater noise in order to identify the contribution of the cavitating propeller background noise correction is applied the background noise was measured by all the participants replacing the propeller with a dummy hub and running the facility at the same advance speed shaft rate and depressurisation level adopted for the tests with the propeller net noise levels are computed based on the signal to noise ratio s n r which is the difference between the total sound pressure levels s p l s n and the background sound pressure levels spl n snr 10 db no correction 7 s p l 10 log 10 p r m s 2 p r e f 2 3 db snr 10 db 8 s p l s 10 log 10 10 s p l s n 10 10 s p l n 10 snr 3 db results are discarded the obtained net noise levels spl s are scaled to a reference distance using a spherical propagation correction which leads to radiated noise levels rnl as follows 9 r n l s p l s 20 log 10 r r r e f where r is the distance between the hydrophone and the propeller r r e f is the reference distance typically equal to 1 m alternatively distance normalization is implicitly accounted for using the transfer function t f to derive the source strength levels sl since the reference transmitting voltage response of the emitter is given at 1m 10 s l s p l s t f data processing proceeds in a slightly different manner in the dwb due to the changing distance between propeller and hydrophone during the measurement a data window is selected in which the propeller is close enough to the hydrophone such that reverberation effects are negligible this window is subsequently divided into 15 segments using 50 overlap for which the source level is determined by applying spherical spreading loss and correcting for the lloyd s mirror effect based on the window s position relative to the hydrophone the background noise correction is then also applied per segment with the final source level obtained by averaging the results from all segments a full description of the procedures used at marin for processing of urn measurements can be found in lloyd et al 2018 2 5 extrapolation to full scale in order to compare all the results of the round robin campaign noise spectra are scaled to a common condition as specified below d s 0 75 m n s 19 025 rps σ n s 1 06 where d s is the diameter of the full scale propeller and n s and σ n s are the propeller rotational speed and the cavitation number corresponding to the maximum speed of the princess royal full scale noise spectra are obtained according to the ittc formulation ittc 2017 11 f s f m n s n m σ s σ m 12 s p l s s p l

used i e w 0 75 x 1 y 1 5 z 1 5 for constant bandwidth spectra w 1 x 1 y 2 z 1 for proportional bandwidth spectra for the latter if power spectral density levels are needed the quantity 10 log 10 δ f where δ f is the bandwidth must be subtracted 3 results in this section results of the round robin programme are analysed comparing measurements among the participants since all the institutions involved addressed the same physical problem ideally they should obtain the same results within reasonable measurement uncertainties consequently this expectation is verified and observed deviation from it are highlighted and discussed in order to identify possible causes in relation with the different facilities setups and equipment employed the analysis focusses at first on cavitation extents considering some examples of available observations successively in subsection 4 2 results of noise measurements are analysed in detail 3 1 cavitation extents before comparing propeller cavitation extents observed by the different participants cavitation patterns for all the loading conditions are presented for one participant only to exemplify the typical cavitation patterns for this purpose the cavitation observed at sspa is shown in fig 2 from the analysis of reported pictures it is possible to make general observations about cavitation patterns present for the loading conditions considered in the round robin programme 1 only suction side cavitation is present consisting of the leading edge vortex and sheet cavitation 2 sorting the operational conditions concerning the increased sheet cavitation extent the following result is obtained c4 c5 c1 c6 c2 and c3 3 sorting the operational conditions with respect to increasing vortex cavitation extent the following result is obtained c4 c3 c5 c1 c6 and c2 4 conditions c1 c2 c5 and c6 are characterised by similar cavitation phenomena and dynamics differing only for the extent of phenomena 5 condition c4 is characterised by the presence of a weak tip vortex very close to inception 6 condition c3 is characterised by rather large sheet cavitation generating cloud cavitation at trailing edge the cavitating core of the tip vortex is disrupted in place of it cloudy vertical structures are present featuring a somewhat unstable behaviour a smaller vortex is generated at the trailing edge of the sheet cavity where the cavity reaches the blade trailing edge these comments hold for tests carried out by all the participants with only the following few exceptions the differences between cavitation extents observed at nmri for j 0 4 c1 c2 and c3 and j 0 5 c4 c5 c6 seem reduced the tip vortex in condition c4 is more stable than in other institutions whereas the sheet cavity in condition c3 is reduced the reasons for these discrepancies may lie in the cavitation numbers adopted for tests which are slightly different from the nominal values see table 5 sheet cavitation observed at kriso for condition c3 is less extended than that observed by other participants while the tip vortex is larger the reason for this is that it was not possible to achieve the very low cavitation number of condition c3 at kriso using the setup adopted hence c3 condition at kriso is characterised by a higher about 50 cavitation number see table 5 hub vortex cavitation was observed for all the loading conditions at cnr inm as already mentioned this phenomenon is not observed in the results from the other facilities because of the adopted propeller configuration the direct comparison of cavitation patterns observed within the round robin programme is shown in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 for conditions c1 c3 and c4 respectively a fair agreement is observed in most cases besides the anomalies already mentioned differences for conditions c1 and c3 mainly concern the extent of the sheet cavitation toward the inner radii sheet cavitation for condition c1 starts around 0 7r for marin unew and sspa around 0 75r for kriso and 0 8 for unige nmri and cnr inm sheet cavitation for condition c3 starts at about 0 3r for marin and sspa 0 6r for unew and unige 0 65 for kriso 0 7 for cnr inm and 0 8 for nmri analysing differences in terms of chordwise elongation and thickness of sheet cavitation is even more difficult because of differences in the observation angles generally the chordwise extent of cavitation for condition c1 is approximately 10 of the chord at inner radii reaching 100 of the chord around 0 95r differently the radial positions where the sheet cavity reaches the trailing edge can be compared for condition c3 this occurs at about 0 65r for marin and sspa 0 7r for unige unew and cnr inm and 0 85r for kriso and nmri finally considering condition c4 a very small tip vortex is visible in the unige marin and unew observations similar cavitation was also present at sspa kriso and cnr inm even if it was not captured in photographs because of its intermittent nature the largest extent of tip vortex at nmri for this condition is due to the different cavitation number adopted from this qualitative analysis it can be concluded that the cavitation observed by the participants is very similar in terms of typology and dynamics with only a few exceptions for the condition with the largest cavitation i e c3 differences in terms of the extent of the sheet cavity are small but non negligible for most conditions the largest differences are observed for the condition with the largest cavitation i e c3 discrepancies mostly concern the extent of the sheet cavity at the inner radii as already remarked the largest discrepancies observed may be ascribed to the small differences in the operational conditions used among the various facilities for certain tests mainly in terms of cavitation number and to the different configuration used at cnr inm further differences especially those concerning the extent of sheet cavitation at inner propeller radii are likely related to the development of the boundary layer on the blades which may vary depending on the reynolds number adopted during tests and on the specific approach used for turbulence stimulation if applied furthermore cavitation at the leading edge may be influenced also by other effects such as the freestream turbulence in the facilities the blade geometry finishing and the water quality the latter is not expected to have significant effects for condition c3 since in this case cavitation is fully developed contributing in the creation of new cavitation nuclei recirculating in the flow this does not hold for the depressurised wave basin conversely different water quality may contribute to the small differences observed in the development of the weak tip vortex for condition c4 3 2 radiated noise the main results of the round robin programme are comparisons of noise measurements carried out by the different participants the comparison of one third octave noise spectra is reported in fig 6 these full scale spectra are obtained by scaling all the measurements according to the procedure described in section 3 as previously mentioned transfer functions are not available for all the participants therefore results include rnl and sl spectra depending on the availability of transfer functions or other corrections however all results will be referred as sl in the following since both quantities represent the same outcome obtained with different approximations on the confined environment effect some anomalous peaks are present in the spectra caused by the presence of significant tonal noise disturbances not cancelled by the background noise correction e g propeller singing structural vibrations shaft line noise this phenomenon may be explained considering that the intensity of some background noise components is larger when the propeller is present therefore the subtraction of the background noise measured without the propeller does not allow cancelling these noise disturbances disregarding the frequency bands containing peaks a band of variation of about 10 db of predicted noise levels is observed on average rising to about 20 db for conditions c3 and c4 results of this overall comparison depend on the considered frequency range high frequency noise above 2 3 khz higher levels were measured at sspa kriso and cnr inm while the lowest levels are in most cases those measured at unige and marin low frequency noise below 2 3 khz higher noise levels were measured at sspa unige and for some conditions nmri kriso and cnr inm the agreement in this frequency range is slightly better even if there are always some spectra deviating from the most common behaviour for most of the conditions tested similarities among the results obtained by the different participants can be observed however the magnitude of the spread measured noise levels is generally rather large as a reference the uncertainty levels estimated for ships noise predictions based on model tests are commonly expected to be 3 5 db according to ittc 2017 a spread of noise data within the round robin campaign comparable with the uncertainty on measurements could be reasonably accepted whereas a significantly larger spread requires further investigation noise spectra are characterised by complex shapes with many features that are not always directly related to the physics of the noise source analysed these include the tonal noise disturbances already mentioned propagation effects hydrophones responses and possible noise absorption caused by free bubbles amongst others nevertheless comparing most of the spectra with the theoretical spectra of cavitation noise see for example blake and sevik 1982 blake 1986 and fitzpatrick and strasberg 1956 some common features may be observed in many cases the continuous part of the cavitation noise spectrum is characterised by the presence of a hump at a medium low frequency whose amplitude and prominence depend on cavitation typology and dynamics this hump usually represents the peak in the broadband spectrum moving to higher frequencies noise levels vary with a certain constant power of the reciprocal of the frequency in some cases two different frequency ranges may be observed with different decay ratios the decay slope typically increases with increasing frequency it is possible to identify the main features of this theoretical cavitation noise spectra as illustrated in fig 7 the analysis of the main characteristics of this schematic spectrum may provide a more in depth insight into the physics of the problem the features that are more directly related to the dynamics of cavitation are the central frequency amplitude width and power content of the spectral hump and the energy content and decay ratio of the high frequency part of the spectrum the hump is associated with low frequency dynamics of cavities such as the pulsation of the tip vortex terwisga et al 2007 or the growth and initial stage of the collapse of cavities fitzpatrick and strasberg 1956 the high frequency spectrum and its characteristics are instead associated with the dynamics and the size of small cavitation bubbles shed by cavitation with the final stage of cavity collapse and with the generation of shock waves from a practical point of view a schematic representation based on piecewise linear functions as shown in the example in fig 7 is used to define the main characteristics of spectra for further analyses in this work the analysis is focused on the following parameters fpeak and slpeak frequency and level of the peak in the schematic spectrum khf decay ratio of the spectrum computed at 10 khz slhf power content between 3 khz and 12 5 khz computed integrating the power spectral density keeping in mind the approximations concerning the definition and fitting of the schematic spectrum onto the real spectra these parameters are analysed in fig 8 and fig 10 which are dedicated to the hump and the high frequency spectrum respectively results from unew are not included in present analysis because of the complex shape of spectra measured in this facility and because narrowband spectra which allow identifying the characteristics analysed are not available starting with the hump characteristics these may be reasonably associated with vortex dynamics for present cases actually when significant tip vortex cavitation is present without major collapses as in the round robin programme the volume pulsation of the vortex around the natural frequency may characterise the radiated noise spectrum producing the prominent peaks observed in current measurements the resonance frequency of a cavitating vortex may be analysed considering the dispersion relation for waves travelling on the cavity surfaces this relation under some hypotheses on the deformation mode generating noise may also provide a relationship between the resonance frequency of the vortex cavity and its dimensions see bosschers 2008 bosschers 2018 and pennings et al 2015 accordingly the analysis of the hump central frequency may provide interesting information on the size of tip vortex cavitation values reported on the left side of fig 8 show a rather good agreement between unige marin kriso sspa and cnr inm while the trend observed at nmri is completely different the anomalous behaviour of the hump in the nmri spectra may be due to the fact that the identified hump is probably not related to tip vortex noise whereas the spectral hump corresponding to vortex pulsation is not clearly detectable this conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the peak levels and other characteristics of the hump e g the width which present similar anomalous trends focussing on the other participants the following main comments may be made considering j 0 4 i e c1 c2 and c3 the hump centre frequency decreases from c1 to c2 where the minimum is observed while it increases for condition c3 this trend is consistent with cavitation extents since the dimensions of the cavitating vortices increase from c1 to c2 where the largest vortices are observed for condition c3 the main vortex is disrupted while a second weaker vortex is present causing the hump at a higher frequency with respect to c1 and c2 condition c3 at kriso was reproduced with a slightly higher cavitation number causing a different cavitation extent and dynamics as already discussed in section 4 1 the resulting vortex exhibits a cavitating core slightly larger compared to condition c2 without any secondary vortex this agrees rather well with the decrease of the hump frequency from condition c2 to c3 observed at kriso considering j 0 5 i e c4 c5 and c6 the maximum hump frequency is observed in correspondence to condition c4 which is consistent with the very small dimensions of the tip vortex for this condition moving to conditions c5 and c6 the hump frequency decreases again which is in good agreement with the increasing cavitating radius sorting the central frequency values for a given participant in decreasing order the result agrees with the tip vortex dimensions qualitatively observed in section 4 1 based on these observations and as long as the peak frequency may be considered representative of the vortex pulsation frequency the agreement observed in terms of vortex dynamics is better than that inferable from the overall comparison of noise spectra in fact in most cases the range of variation is below 100 hz with few exceptions observed in the measurements performed at kriso which are likely due to the small differences in the operational conditions as already remarked moving to the analysis of the peak levels the comparison is more complicated and the agreement within participants results is relatively worse nevertheless common trends are present minimum levels are observed for condition c4 for which the vortex is just past inception noise levels increase significantly from condition c4 to c5 and c6 except for c6 at kriso and nmri whose hump interpretation is doubtful as already remarked the trend is more complicated considering conditions with j 0 4 and lower differences are observed among conditions c1 c2 and c3 than among c4 c5 and c6 j 0 5 two main trends are observed considering unige and sspa measurements the peak level increases passing from c1 to c2 while it remains almost constant passing from c2 to c3 considering marin nmri and cnr inm results instead the peak level decreases passing from c1 to c2 while the level for c3 is again very similar to that observed for c1 sorting the peak levels for a given participant in increasing order the results are different depending on the selected participant and generally it is more difficult to correlate the obtained order with that of vortex dimensions the spread in results is in most cases of about 10 db except for condition c4 which shows larger variation due to incipient and intermittent cavitation this general value is significant but probably lower than the overall spread observed from the global analysis of the spectra in summary the interpretation of peak levels is more complex than peak frequency the complex trends observed for the peak levels may be due to different causes the identification of the spectral hump may be not correct in some cases its interpretation as the noise associated with tip vortex pulsation may be not completely correct or consistent on the other hand differences in noise levels may be related to other effects not concerning the characteristics of the noise source such as the acoustic response of the facility sensors etc in order to investigate the possible causes of differences in the spectral hump the available data on the central frequency and peak levels are compared assuming that the central frequency of the hump is only influenced by the size of cavitating vortices if the differences among peak levels are consistent with the differences among central frequency it could be concluded that global differences in the spectral hump are caused by different vortex diameters among the participants however the direct comparison of frequencies and noise levels is not meaningful thus a different approach is exploited as previously mentioned formulations exist describing the relation between the pulsation frequency of a cavitating vortex and its radius similarly semi empirical formulations for the amplitude of the vortex peak are available among these formulations those proposed in bosschers 2018 are considered in the present work defined as 13 r c c 1 n d σ n f p e a k and 14 r c c 2 d p p e a k ρ n 2 d 2 z 2 k where f b p n z is the blade passage frequency z the blades number p p e a k 10 s l p e a k 20 p r e f is the acoustic pressure correspondent to s l p e a k and r c the cavity radius the constants c 1 and c 2 and the exponent k should be found based on the fitting with experimental data in the present work k 3 is assumed according to the findings of bosschers 2018 the procedure needed to find constants c 1 and c 2 would require the use of a vortex model to compute r c based on the propeller blade loading and a significant amount of experimental data possibly including many more loading conditions than those considered in the round robin programme however such a procedure is not required for the aims of current analyses since interesting information may be derived simply from the analysis of relative trends consequently a different approach is used the vortex cavitating radii r c f p e a k corresponding to measured central frequencies are computed with equation 13 and the resulting values normalised dividing them by the maximum value over the dataset the result of this normalization does not depend on the constant c 1 whose knowledge is no more required analogously the radii r c s l p e a k are derived from equation 14 and normalised in the same way the resulting values of r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k for all the six loading conditions are reported in fig 9 further comments can be made from the direct comparison of r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k first the spread of central frequencies and peak level is analysed omitting the anomalous values observed in the measurements by nmri considering condition c1 as an example the values of r c f p e a k lie between about 45 and 60 of the maximum while the values of r c s l p e a k are between about 57 and 81 hence exhibiting a slightly larger spread however moving to condition c2 the ranges of these variations are from 63 to 100 for r c f p e a k and from 69 to 100 for r c s l p e a k extending this comparison to all the operational conditions it can be concluded that generally the spread among the data is similar for what concerns frequencies and peak levels apparently suggesting that these discrepancies may be caused by the same phenomena however the observed trends for r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k are in general not consistent comparing two different loading conditions for a given participant r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k show the opposite behaviour in some cases e g compare c1 and c2 for marin results c2 and c3 for kriso or the propeller loading has a significantly different effect on r c f p e a k and r c s l p e a k e g compare c2 and c3 for unige and sspa similar discrepancies are observed comparing results among different participants for a given loading condition in summary this analysis indicates that the differences in terms of cavitation extents among the participants are appreciable and may contribute to the spread of noise data however other analyses should also be made to explain the spread of data as well as the inconsistency observed in terms of relative trends in order to complete the analysis of noise results the high frequency part of the spectrum is considered this portion of the spectrum is mainly related to the collapse of cavities for uniform inflow conditions the main cavities show an almost stationary behaviour hence collapses mainly concern the small cavities shed from both sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation therefore the intensity and frequency content of the high frequency noise should depend on the amount frequency and intensity of collapses which are related to cavitation extents and other aspects influencing bubble dynamics such as the presence of non condensable gas and fluid compressibility analysing the average decay ratio of the high frequency spectrum reported on the left side plot of fig 10 most values are between 10 and 20 db per decade in good agreement with data on cavitation noise available in the literature ceccio and brennen 1991 the spread of results is again appreciable and it seems difficult to detect common trends the analysis of the decay ratio at a given frequency allows only partial comparison of the characteristics of the high frequency noise spectrum as clearly visible in the examples shown in fig 7 this frequency i e 10 khz is either lower or higher than the frequency that divides the two spectral parts with different decay slopes of the schematized spectrum this fact complicates the interpretation of this quantity which is not probably an effective parameter to describe results according to the aims of the present work finally the right plot in fig 10 reports the sound pressure level computed over a wide frequency range defined in such a way as to represent the power content of the high frequency spectrum for all the participants the spread of values is significant differences of 10 db on average are observed for the conditions characterised by intermediate cavitation i e c1 c2 c5 and c6 while even 20 db differences are observed between the highest and lowest measured levels for conditions c3 and c4 the latter conditions being characterised by very large cavitation and incipient cavitation respectively are relatively more sensitive to possible differences among the experiments carried out by the participants therefore it is not completely surprising to observe a larger spread of results for such conditions however the magnitude of the spread of data for both intermediate and extreme cavitation cases is remarkable focussing instead on the trends concerning propeller loading conditions some similarities are detectable with only a few exceptions the main common features are the high frequency noise increases from condition c1 to c3 and from c4 to c6 the high frequency noise is higher for j 0 4 for which more sheet cavitation is present compared to j 0 5 maximum and minimum noise levels are measured for condition c3 and c4 respectively except nmri which is in good agreement with the observed cavitation patterns sorting the high frequency noise levels for a given participant in increasing order the results partially agree with the sheet cavitation extent in most cases noise levels for the intermediate cavitation conditions c1 c2 c5 and c6 are rather similar summarising the above comments the trend of the high frequency noise levels analysed for a given participant agrees rather well with the observed cavitation extent in general higher levels are measured when the propeller loading is higher with consequently larger sheet cavitation however comparing different participants results do not always correlate with observed cavitation extent the analyses presented focussing on noise levels for a single frequency band or on the level of the peak as in fig 8 allow appreciation of how noise levels vary with respect to propeller loading conditions for each participant it can be concluded that differences in noise levels found by each participant when modifying propeller loading conditions at least limited to intermediate cavitation conditions i e c1 c2 c5 and c6 are comparable and in many cases lower than the differences among the results obtained by the different participants for the same propeller loading condition 4 conclusions results of the round robin campaign on propeller noise measurements at model scale carried out by the noise community of practice of the hydrotesting forum are analysed cavitation patterns observed within the round robin programme are generally very similar in terms of phenomena extent and dynamics several discrepancies do exist however many reasons may contribute to these differences among which the most important are the small differences in the definition of the operational conditions and the development of the boundary layer on propeller blades furthermore possible differences in the geometries of propeller models could play a role and should be analysed in the future the analysis of noise results highlighted the significant spread of data even when trying to neglect the effects of unwanted noise components some important comments may be made based on the analysis of the main characteristics of the noise spectra namely the frequency and the peak level of the medium low frequency hump and the decay ratio and power content of the high frequency noise common trends were observed for all the considered characteristics a rather good agreement is present in terms of the centre frequency of the spectral hump which is most highly associated with the noise generated by tip vortex cavitation the values of the frequencies correlate rather well also with observed extents of vortex cavitation the peak levels of the medium low frequency hump correlate worse with cavitation extent even if the dependency of this quantity on propeller loading showed some similarities for each participant discrepancies are present and it is more difficult to recognise a common trend these comments are confirmed by the comparison of tip vortex cavitating radii derived from measured central frequency and peak levels of the spectral hump by means of semi empirical formulations the spread of results is similar but relative trends are in many cases not consistent the decay slope of the high frequency spectrum is rather different for each participant although most values lay within values reported in the literature for cavitation noise however due to the different frequency range available for each participant it is difficult to make a fair comparison of high frequency spectrum slope the power content of the high frequency noise is characterised by a significant spread even if some common trends are observed in terms of dependency of the noise levels on propeller loading conditions differences observed in terms of noise levels comparing all the propeller loading conditions characterised by moderate cavitation for a given participant are comparable or even lower than differences observed comparing measurements carried out by all the participants for a given loading condition in summary the comparison of results obtained within the round robin programme highlights the need for further studies aiming at explaining such large discrepancies in view of this the analyses reported here already provide some useful indications some differences among the experiments carried out by the participants to the round robin programme also exist in terms of the definition of propeller loading conditions and cavitation extents however these differences are not expected to cause the large discrepancies that are observed among the noise data observed cavitation is always characterised by the same dynamic behaviour and similar extents also the analysis of the central frequency of the spectral hump suggests that vortex dynamics are similar for most of the participants finally the overall analysis of the effects of the loading conditions on measured noise confirms that these effects are not sufficient to explain the large dispersion of data and the inconsistent trends observed based on these conclusions further aspects will be investigated in the future not only concerning the development of cavitation but also the generation propagation acquisition and processing of noise data including the following main aspects effects of water quality on noise generation and propagation effects of the acoustic response of the facility effects of the oblique flow effects of the adoption of different scaling laws to compare results of the round robin campaign credit authorship contribution statement giorgio tani

21683,propeller cavitation noise one of the main sources of ship noise has recently gained much attention owing to its possible adverse effects on marine life in order to predict full scale propeller cavitation noise a model test method using the large cavitation tunnel at the korea research institute of ships ocean engineering kriso was developed the standard procedure consists of reproduction of the noise source noise measurement postprocessing and noise scaling the propeller cavitation is reproduced in the same manner as in the cavitation observation test and the noise is measured after correcting the multipath effect and the background noise the model scale source level sl is estimated the transfer function tf which represents the multipath effect can be measured using a virtual

effectiveness of the model test method in predicting full scale propeller cavitation noise keywords propeller cavitation noise model test full scale noise prediction full scale noise measurement validation test 1 introduction ship noise has become an important issue recently owing to its adverse effects on the marine environment propeller cavitation is one of the main noise sources in a ship thus recent studies focused on experimentally and or numerically predicting propeller cavitation noise in preparation for future shipping noise regulations imo 2014 experimental studies of cavitation noise have been performed to meet various objectives such as detecting the inception and extent of cavitation identifying noise characteristics with respect to cavitation behaviors and predicting cavitation noise levels in noise tests it is important to set up the proper test procedure for reliable measurements and analysis of the noise data therefore one of the main concerns in cavitation noise studies is establishing the measuring techniques or procedures appropriate for each type of facility configuration ittc 2017 iso 2018 important considerations for the model test include the acoustic characteristics of the facility and the scaling methods research results regarding the acoustic characteristics of the test facilities were reported by tani et al 2015 2019 and lafeber et al 2015 the scaling method was well described by the ittc special committee on hydrodynamic noise ittc 2017 a validation study was performed by many researchers by comparing numerical simulations seol et al 2015 park et al 2018b and or experimental results with measured full scale data lafeber and bosschers 2016 lloyd et al 2018 kleinsorge et al 2017 li et al 2018 tani et al 2016 traverso et al 2017 aktas et al 2016 in the literature on validation studies it was seen that the transfer function is mainly used to convert the measured sound pressure level spl to the model scale source level sl in addition the low frequency scaling method is usually employed to convert the model scale source level to the full scale source level however multipath correction and the scaling methods can vary from test facility to test facility so they should be properly validated at each facility in this paper the following are presented 1 validation of the sl estimation method using the transfer function tf correction and 2 evaluation of scaling methods including low frequency scaling and high frequency scaling to validate the tf correction a known source or two sources for the twin propeller are used instead of the propeller s to evaluate the scaling methods two types of validation studies are performed first a series of model tests are carried out at different flow speeds the source levels at different flow speeds are scaled to a specific flow speed and are compared with each other second full scale noise measurements are carried out and are compared with the model test results validation tests are performed on two ships each equipped with a single propeller and twin propellers this paper is organized as follows the model scale and full scale test methods are described in section 2 and section 3 respectively section 4 presents the results and discussion finally the conclusions are given in section 5 2 model scale test methods 2 1 noise measurement test procedure in order to estimate the full scale propeller cavitation noise using model tests it is necessary to accurately reproduce the cavitation pattern based on the similarity laws between the model and the ship for this purpose we use a large cavitation tunnel lct fig 1 a where the wake field is generated by a model ship the model ship is installed inside the tunnel corresponding to the full scale draft as in fig 1 c the free surface is covered by plates to suppress the wave interference on the model the model ship draft in the tunnel is increased within the capacity constraint of the test facilities to compensate for the deceleration of the flow owing to the boundary layer below these wave suppressing plates the noise measuring system consists of a 45 channel hydrophone array signal conditioning amplifiers and a data acquisition unit the hydrophone is the b k 8103 which has a flat frequency response over a range of 0 1 hz 180 khz with a nominal receiving sensitivity of 211 db re 1 v μpa the b k nexus type 2692 is used as a conditioning amplifier and signals are acquired by the b k pulse analyzer platform the hydrophone array is installed inside the acoustic trough as shown in fig 1 b in lct cavitation tests the propeller cavitation test conditions were derived from the results of self propulsion test in towing tank the propeller is tested at a pre scribed set of parameters cavitation number σn advance coefficient ja and thrust coefficient kt at a particular propulsion operating point the procedure for setting the tunnel flow conditions to achieve a model simulation of this operating point is usually made on the basis of the thrust identity 1 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 where t is the propeller thrust d n and ρ represent the propeller diameter the propeller rotational speed and the water density respectively 2 σ n p 0 p v 1 2 ρ n 2 d 2 where p 0 is the hydrostatic pressure at the propeller and p v is the vapor pressure during the propeller cavitation observations and noise measurements the pressure in the cavitation tunnel is adjusted according to the local cavitation number at a specific point approximating the center of the expected cavitation extent in the upper part of the disk which is typically 0 7r above the propeller centerline to mitigate the scale effects i e viscous and bubble dynamic effects the shaft revolution speed of the model propeller is chosen to be higher than that required by froude s law the air content of the water and the distribution of the cavitation nuclei play important roles in the cavitation inception and its development the nuclei distribution cannot be controlled in our cavitation tunnel but the air content is typically set to around 60 for the cavitation tests propeller cavitation noise is measured during the cavitation test in order to have sufficient data for the analysis the acquisition time is typically set to 20 s which corresponds to a few hundreds of propeller rotations the background noise is measured after measuring the propeller cavitation noise in order to check the validity of the measured data the background noise is measured in the absence of the propeller cavitation propeller replaced by a dummy hub but with all other operating conditions as similar as possible a reference field is measured to assess the influence of multiple reflections inside the tunnel the reference field is defined as the sound pressure field which is measured using a virtual source located at a given position i e the acoustic center an underwater transducer which converts the electrical input to a pressure signal with its own transmitting voltage response tvr is used as the virtual source the source strength of the virtual source can be calculated directly from the known input signal voltage and tvr the input signal is generated using a function generator and is amplified if necessary broadband signals such as white noise and chirp signals can be used as the input signal to fully cover the frequency range of interest however a white noise signal is preferred for the twin propeller test during the reference field measurements the pressure is kept the same as the propeller cavitation noise measurement in order to prevent a change in air content however the reference field is measured without flows owing to the low mach number of the cavitation test it is also noted that since the assumed acoustic center is the propeller center for simplicity of installation of the virtual source the mismatch between the assumed and true acoustic center locations might be a source of errors when estimating the source levels from the noise measurements 2 2 post processing after the noise is measured postprocessing is required to adjust the sound pressure levels for background noise conditions and to convert the background noise corrected sound pressure levels to the source levels by using measured reference fields finally scaling procedures are required to obtain full scale noise levels of the propeller cavitation from the measurements on the model scale in the context of noise assessment the sound pressure level spl l p is the fundamental quantity of the sound pressure and it is defined as 3 l p 10 log 10 p 2 p ref 2 where p 2 is the time mean square pressure of the measured sound pressure in the one third octave band and p r e f is the reference pressure 1 μpa the signal plus noise to noise ratio δl for each one third octave band is defined as 4 δ l l p s n l p n log 10 p s n 2 p n 2 where l p s n is the sound pressure level of the propeller cavitation noise and l p n is the sound pressure level of the background noise if δl is greater than 10 db then no adjustments are necessary by contrast if δl is less than 3 db then the measurements are dominated by background noise and cannot be used finally if 3 db δl 10 db then adjustments to the measurements are required as follows 5 l p 10 log 10 10 l p s n 10 10 l p n 10 where l p is the background noise adjusted sound pressure level of the cavitating propeller computed in the one third octave band the effects of reflections from the tunnel walls are adjusted using the reference field the time mean square pressure of the input signal p i 2 of the virtual source at a distance of 1 m can be calculated from the input voltage signal and tvr as 6 p i 2 v i 2 p r e f 2 v r e f 2 10 tvr 10 where v i 2 is the time mean square voltage input to the virtual source for each one third octave band and v r e f is the reference voltage of 1 v using the reference field data the transfer function tf for each one third octave band is defined as 7 t f 10 log 10 p r 2 p i 2 where p r 2 is the time mean square pressure of the measured reference field in the one third octave band then the model scale source level sl l s becomes 8 l s l p t f when multiple hydrophones are used the averaged sl can be obtained as 9 l s 10 log 10 1 n i 1 n 10 l s i 10 where n is the number of hydrophones which corresponds to 45 channels in lct unlike a single propeller ship there are two pairs of noise sources port side starboard side in a twin propeller ship therefore not only the position of the acoustic centers but also the amplitude and phase of each noise source affects the transfer function according to park et al 2018a a coherently defined transfer function which is defined in eq 10 was most proper to apply for the twin propeller ship considering the possible interference between two input signals 10 t f t w i n 10 log 10 p r 2 p i t w i n 2 and 11 p i t w i n 2 1 t 0 t p i 1 t p i 2 t 2 d t where p i 1 v i 1 p r e f v r e f 10 t v r 1 20 and p i 2 v i 2 p r e f v r e f 10 t v r 2 20 for the two virtual sources by applying eq 10 to eq 8 or eq 9 the model scale source level for the twin propeller ship can be obtained a prediction of the full scale noise levels can be made using noise scaling laws recommended by ittc ittc 2017 assuming the same cavitation numbers of the model and the full scale the increase in noise levels from model to full scale is given by 12 δ l s 10 log 10 r s r m x n s d s n m d m y d s d m z and the frequency shift relation is given by 13 f s f m n s n m where r is the distance between the source and the receiver r 1 in our case and the subscripts s and m refer to full scale and model scale respectively the exponent factors x y z in eq 12 are 2 3 3 for low frequency scaling and 2 2 3 for high frequency scaling it is noted that these ittc scaling laws concern only differences in dimensions and operating conditions of the model and full scale propellers and therefore do not reflect the reynolds scaling effect a scaling law was introduced considering the viscous effect of the tip vortex park and seong 2017 3 full scale test methods a full scale underwater radiated noise urn measurement study was conducted from 2014 to 2018 kriso 2018 in this study the urns of six different ships were measured two 50 k tankers two container carriers 10 000 teu and 14 000 teu a 176 k lng carrier and a 74 k product carrier full scale tests were performed according to the test procedure of iso 17208 1 iso 2016 except for the water depth of the test site as shown in fig 2 a there were two test sites for urn measurements one that is deep enough to meet the requirements of the iso standard site d approximately 400 m water depth and a second that is relatively shallow site s about 110 m deep in order to reduce the test time two sets of hydrophone arrays were simultaneously used for measurements for each array three hydrophones were deployed from a surface buoy and fixed to the bottom using two heavy weights in deepwater measurements the hydrophone depths corresponded to angles of 15 30 and 45 from the designated closest point of approach cpa however in shallow water measurements the hydrophones were set as even as possible within the water column the arrangements of the hydrophone array are given in fig 2 c and d for the site s and site d respectively two runs were performed for each test condition corresponding to two sets of portside and starboard measurements during the measurements as shown in fig 2 b the ship was free running in a typical loading condition following predetermined waypoints passing through the middle of the two surface buoys the ship under test was required to be kept in a steady state at least 500 m before the start point of noise measurement the signal was recorded at a sampling frequency of 60 khz additional environmental data were measured including sound speeds winds currents and water depths at the test site the exact locations of the surface buoys and the target ship were determined using dgps furthermore the depth of the hydrophone was measured by a depth sensor data from dgps and the depth sensors were used to determine the slant distance between the ship and the hydrophone ship operation data such as the shaft power and rotational speed were also measured for analysis the measured urn data were processed according to iso 17208 1 iso 2016 to obtain the final full scale sl the measured spl was converted to sl after background noise correction and distance correction assuming a spherical spreading loss corrections of the lloyds mirror effect of the sea surface and the reflection from the bottom were not applied during postprocessing among the measured ships two ships a 14 000 teu container carrier and a 176 k lng carrier were chosen for the validation study the container ship was equipped with a five bladed fixed pitch propeller and the lng carrier had two four bladed fixed pitch propellers the measurements of the container ship and the lng carrier were performed at site d and site s in fig 2 a respectively the 14 000 teu container carrier was also used for a validation study of the numerical simulation by park et al 2018b 4 results and discussion 4 1 single propeller ship in order to validate the sl estimation method via tf correction a virtual source test was performed as follows first the transfer function was estimated in accordance with eq 6 and eq 7 for the tf estimation white noise was used as input to the virtual source itc 1032 hydrophone second sound pressure levels were measured using the other input signals which included four white noises s1 s4 and four chirp signals s5 s8 the frequency range of the chirp signals was 1 100 khz finally the measured sound pressure levels were converted to the source levels using the estimated tf by eq 8 meanwhile the source levels of s1 s8 were calculated directly from eq 6 and can be considered as the true source levels fig 3 shows the sl estimation results for the white noise input s1 and the chirp signal s5 from fig 3 it is observed that the estimated source levels agree very well with the true source levels for a quantitative evaluation the estimation error is defined as the absolute difference between the true and estimated source levels at each frequency table 1 lists the mean and maximum estimation errors in the frequency band of 1 100 khz the estimation error of the white noise is generally lower than that of the chirp signal since tf was measured using the white noise even in the case of the chirp signal the estimation error is not very large for a validation study of the scaling methods a series of model tests were performed for different cavitation patterns the test conditions are given in table 2 for each test condition the flow speed of the tunnel was set to 6 5 m s 7 5 m s and 8 5 m s for scaling the cavitation patterns observed at a flow speed of 7 5 m s are shown in fig 4 the model scale source levels estimated by eqs 8 and 9 at each flow speed are shown in fig 5 the source levels at 6 5 m s and 7 5 m s were scaled to 8 5 m s using the scaling laws and the results are compared in fig 5 table 3 lists the errors between the source levels for each test condition which are defined as 14 e 1 n f i 1 n f s t d l s 1 f c i l s 2 f c i l s 3 f c i where the operator std represents the standard deviation of the source levels in f c refers to the center frequency of the one third octave band and n f is the number of frequencies it is observed from fig 5 and table 3 that the errors after scaling became smaller than those of the unscaled sl and the low frequency scaling shows the best performance fig 6 shows a comparison of the measured and scaled source levels for the single propeller ship operating at a nominal continuous rating ncr the low frequency and high frequency scaling slightly underestimate the full scale source level below 500 hz and exceed the measured data after 1 khz when comparing both scaling methods the low frequency scaling gives slightly higher source levels than the high frequency scaling over the entire frequency range 4 2 twin propeller ship a validation test of the sl estimation using tf correction was performed on a twin propeller ship as well in this test the transfer function was estimated by eq 10 using two virtual sources with different white noise inputs the sound pressure levels were measured using six different input signals including three white noises s1 s3 and three chirp signals s4 s6 fig 7 shows the sl estimation results for a white noise input s1 and a chirp signal s4 after applying tf correction as in eq 8 for the twin sources the true source level is calculated by eq 11 table 4 lists the mean and maximum estimation errors evaluated in the same way as the previous single source test from the results in fig 7 and table 4 the source level estimation method using tf correction seems to work well for two sources as well as for a single source although the estimation error is larger than that of a single source as in the case of a single propeller a validation test of scaling methods was carried out at different flow conditions 6 5 m s 7 5 m s and 8 5 m s for the two test cases in table 5 the cavitation patterns of the portside propeller which were observed at a flow speed of 7 5 m s are shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the model scale source levels estimated by eq 8 and eq 10 from the sound pressure levels measured at different flow speeds the source levels at 7 5 m s and 6 5 m s were scaled to 8 5 m s using two scaling methods low frequency scaling and high frequency scaling the results are compared in fig 9 as well the scaling errors defined in eq 14 are given in table 6 from the results it is observed that the errors are also reduced after scaling as in the single propeller case in fig 5 and table 3 fig 10 shows a comparison of the measured and scaled source levels for the twin propeller ship operating at an ncr condition the low frequency and high frequency scaling underestimate the full scale source level in the frequency range of 100 hz 1 khz and exceed the measured data in the low frequency range below 50 hz the reason for overestimating in the low frequency region is not clearly known the ratio of the propeller tip speed n s d s n m d m in eq 12 is 1 08 which leads to a small difference between the low frequency and high frequency scaling 5 conclusion a validation study of the model test method to predict full scale propeller cavitation noise was performed using a kriso large cavitation tunnel a series of model tests was performed and data were processed in accordance with the standard procedure described in the paper in addition full scale tests were carried out following the procedure of iso 17208 1 full scale data of a 14 000 teu container carrier with a single propeller and a 176 k lng carrier with twin propellers were used for the validation study of scaling methods for the single propeller ship tests using a virtual source showed the effectiveness of the source level estimation method using transfer function correction a validation test of the scaling methods was carried out at different flow speeds 6 5 m s 7 5 m s and 8 5 m s for three test cases errors between scaled source levels were less than those of unscaled source levels and low frequency scaling showed the best performance in terms of the scaling error comparing the measured and scaled full scale source levels of the single propeller ship at the ncr condition the low frequency scaling showed slightly higher source levels than the high frequency scaling over the entire frequency range for the twin propeller ship the effectiveness of the source level estimation method using transfer function correction was also confirmed through tests with two known sound sources in the flow speed variation test a result similar to that of the single propeller ship was obtained but the scaling error was larger than that of the single propeller comparing the measured and scaled source levels of the twin propeller ship at the ncr condition the low frequency scaling and high frequency scaling showed similar scaling results because the tip rotational speeds of the model and prototype were almost the same from this study it is confirmed that the model test method consisting of the transfer function method to estimate the model scale source level and an adequate extrapolation to the full scale yields reasonable results currently the low

carrier and a 74 k product carrier full scale tests were performed according to the test procedure of iso 17208 1 iso 2016 except for the water depth of the test site as shown in fig 2 a there were two test sites for urn measurements one that is deep enough to meet the requirements of the iso standard site d approximately 400 m water depth and a second that is relatively shallow site s about 110 m deep in order to reduce the test time two sets of hydrophone arrays were simultaneously used for measurements for each array three hydrophones were deployed from a surface buoy and fixed to the bottom using two heavy weights in deepwater measurements the hydrophone depths corresponded to angles of 15 30 and 45 from the designated closest point of approach cpa however in shallow water measurements the hydrophones were set as even as possible within the water column the arrangements of the hydrophone array are given in fig 2 c and d for the site s and site d respectively two runs were performed for each test condition corresponding to two sets of portside and starboard measurements during the measurements as shown in fig 2 b the ship was free running in a typical loading condition following predetermined waypoints passing through the middle of the two surface buoys the ship under test was required to be kept in a steady state at least 500 m before the start point of noise measurement the signal was recorded at a sampling frequency of 60 khz additional environmental data were measured including sound speeds winds currents and water depths at the test site the exact locations of the surface buoys and the target ship were determined using dgps furthermore the depth of the hydrophone was measured by a depth sensor data from dgps and the depth sensors were used to determine the slant distance between the ship and the hydrophone ship operation data such as the shaft power and rotational speed were also measured for analysis the measured urn data were processed according to iso 17208 1 iso 2016 to obtain the final full scale sl the measured spl was converted to sl after background noise correction and distance correction assuming a spherical spreading loss corrections of the lloyds mirror effect of the sea surface and the reflection from the bottom were not applied during postprocessing among the measured ships two ships a 14 000 teu container carrier and a 176 k lng carrier were chosen for the validation study the container ship was equipped with a five bladed fixed pitch propeller and the lng carrier had two four bladed fixed pitch propellers the measurements of the container ship and the lng carrier were performed at site d and site s in fig 2 a respectively the 14 000 teu container carrier was also used for a validation study of the numerical simulation by park et al 2018b 4 results and discussion 4 1 single propeller ship in order to validate the sl estimation method via tf correction a virtual source test was performed as follows first the transfer function was estimated in accordance with eq 6 and eq 7 for the tf estimation white noise was used as input to the virtual source itc 1032 hydrophone second sound pressure levels were measured using the other input signals which included four white noises s1 s4 and four chirp signals s5 s8 the frequency range of the chirp signals was 1 100 khz finally the measured sound pressure levels were converted to the source levels using the estimated tf by eq 8 meanwhile the source levels of s1 s8 were calculated directly from eq 6 and can be considered as the true source levels fig 3 shows the sl estimation results for the white noise input s1 and the chirp signal s5 from fig 3 it is observed that the estimated source levels agree very well with the true source levels for a quantitative evaluation the estimation error is defined as the absolute difference between the true and estimated source levels at each frequency table 1 lists the mean and maximum estimation errors in the frequency band of 1 100 khz the estimation error of the white noise is generally lower than that of the chirp signal since tf was measured using the white noise even in the case of the chirp signal the estimation error is not very large for a validation study of the scaling methods a series of model tests were performed for different cavitation patterns the test conditions are given in table 2 for each test condition the flow speed of the tunnel was set to 6 5 m s 7 5 m s and 8 5 m s for scaling the cavitation patterns observed at a flow speed of 7 5 m s are shown in fig 4 the model scale source levels estimated by eqs 8 and 9 at each flow speed are shown in fig 5 the source levels at 6 5 m s and 7 5 m s were scaled to 8 5 m s using the scaling laws and the results are compared in fig 5 table 3 lists the errors between the source levels for each test condition which are defined as 14 e 1 n f i 1 n f s t d l s 1 f c i l s 2 f c i l s 3 f c i where the operator std represents the standard deviation of the source levels in f c refers to the center frequency of the one third octave band and n f is the number of frequencies it is observed from fig 5 and table 3 that the errors after scaling became smaller than those of the unscaled sl and the low frequency scaling shows the best performance fig 6 shows a comparison of the measured and scaled source levels for the single propeller ship operating at a nominal continuous rating ncr the low frequency and high frequency scaling slightly underestimate the full scale source level below 500 hz and exceed the measured data after 1 khz when comparing both scaling methods the low frequency scaling gives slightly higher source levels than the high frequency scaling over the entire frequency range 4 2 twin propeller ship a validation test of the sl estimation using tf correction was performed on a twin propeller ship as well in this test the transfer function was estimated by eq 10 using two virtual sources with different white noise inputs the sound pressure levels were measured using six different input signals including three white noises s1 s3 and three chirp signals s4 s6 fig 7 shows the sl estimation results for a white noise input s1 and a chirp signal s4 after applying tf correction as in eq 8 for the twin sources the true source level is calculated by eq 11 table 4 lists the mean and maximum estimation errors evaluated in the same way as the previous single source test from the results in fig 7 and table 4 the source level estimation method using tf correction seems to work well for two sources as well as for a single source although the estimation error is larger than that of a single source as in the case of a single propeller a validation test of scaling methods was carried out at different flow conditions 6 5 m s 7 5 m s and 8 5 m s for the two test cases in table 5 the cavitation patterns of the portside propeller which were observed at a flow speed of 7 5 m s are shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the model scale source levels estimated by eq 8 and eq 10 from the sound pressure levels measured at different flow speeds the source levels at 7 5 m s and 6 5 m s were scaled to 8 5 m s using two scaling methods low frequency scaling and high frequency scaling the results are compared in fig 9 as well the scaling errors defined in eq 14 are given in table 6 from the results it is observed that the errors are also reduced after scaling as in the single propeller case in fig 5 and table 3 fig 10 shows a comparison of the measured and scaled source levels for the twin propeller ship operating at an ncr condition the low frequency and high frequency scaling underestimate the full scale source level in the frequency range of 100 hz 1 khz and exceed the measured data in the low frequency range below 50 hz the reason for overestimating in the low frequency region is not clearly known the ratio of the propeller tip speed n s d s n m d m in eq 12 is 1 08 which leads to a small difference between the low frequency and high frequency scaling 5 conclusion a validation study of the model test method to predict full scale propeller cavitation noise was performed using a kriso large cavitation tunnel a series of model tests was performed and data were processed in accordance with the standard procedure described in the paper in addition full scale tests were carried out following the procedure of iso 17208 1 full scale data of a 14 000 teu container carrier with a single propeller and a 176 k lng carrier with twin propellers were used for the validation study of scaling methods for the single propeller ship tests using a virtual source showed the effectiveness of the source level estimation method using transfer function correction a validation test of the scaling methods was carried out at different flow speeds 6 5 m s 7 5 m s and 8 5 m s for three test cases errors between scaled source levels were less than those of unscaled source levels and low frequency scaling showed the best performance in terms of the scaling error comparing the measured and scaled full scale source levels of the single propeller ship at the ncr condition the low frequency scaling showed slightly higher source levels than the high frequency scaling over the entire frequency range for the twin propeller ship the effectiveness of the source level estimation method using transfer function correction was also confirmed through tests with two known sound sources in the flow speed variation test a result similar to that of the single propeller ship was obtained but the scaling error was larger than that of the single propeller comparing the measured and scaled source levels of the twin propeller ship at the ncr condition the low frequency scaling and high frequency scaling showed similar scaling results because the tip rotational speeds of the model and prototype were almost the same from this study it is confirmed that the model test method consisting of the transfer function method to estimate the model scale source level and an adequate extrapolation to the full scale yields reasonable results currently the low frequency scaling method is typically used in kriso large cavitation tunnel to predict the full scale source level credit authorship contribution statement cheolsoo park conceptualization methodology

21684,this study describes a new assessment technique for evaluating marine coating performance on ice the current evaluation methods related to the ice friction performance are investigated and their limitations are analyzed to ensure the accuracy and validity of the study ice abrasion specimens were prepared using paints applied to actual ice class vessels instead of the commonly used rubber material roller the cold model ice was used as the corresponding abrasion materials on the coating to assess ice friction and abrasion performance a new test procedures are developed abrasion was generated in the unit of abrasion distance of about 3 km per coating and abrasion was finally generated up to about 12 km as the ice abrasion progressed scratches and peelings occurred on the surface of the ipc therefore it was found that the surface roughness and frictional coefficient of the ipc gradually increased afc on the other hand tended to separate like dust as the surface coatings were ground on ice and the surface roughness but also frictional coefficient did not change significantly it was confirmed that the ice abrasion phenomena were different according to the type of paints and the ice friction performance effect of the marine coating could be varied keywords ice friction ice abrasion marine coating for ice class vessels surface roughness 1 introduction ship resistances in ice covered waters not only are very bulky compared with the resistance in open water but also change with dramatic fluctuations according to the ice conditions of the contact many researches to inquire into ice resistances closely had been studied for long kashteljan et al 1968 vance 1975 valanto cho and lee 2015 and the ice resistance is analyzed into ice breaking resistance ice buoyancy resistance and ice friction resistance frictional coefficient of hull is changed by ice abrasion so if the frictional coefficient of hull is changed the ice resistance of the ship is also affected needs to develop the arctic sea are increasing due to the possibility of economic northern sea route nsr and climate changes and various operating systems such as icebreaker assistance and safe navigation supporting system are also developed for safe sailing in the nsr therefore the ice breaking performance of ships will not be important like the present but also a fleet of transportation ships with assisted icebreakers will often sail in the nsr besides broken ice floes generated near the bow of ships do not move to the bottom of ships because of the recent advance of hull forms so that the effect of an ice buoyance resistance is smaller and smaller finally the friction and abrasion performances of ships will be so dominant and hot to estimate an icebreaker s performance and the friction phenomena and mechanism with ice is needed to study and develop in the early 1970s research on the frictional resistance in ice is still in its early stage but also the paint for ice class vessels has never been studied so far only anti fouling coating was coated on the hull surface because there was no paint that could survive with ice it was reported that the anti fouling coating were worn away during first few days in ice covered waters and the hull was corroded in places sodhi 1995 finally it is gradually covered to the whole surface and would greatly affect ship s speed in 1973 teknos first developed the inerta160 that can withstand with ice collisions www teknos co kr company and jotun also released the paint for ice class vessels www jotun com no studies have ever tried to examine an ice abrasion test with paints for ice class vessels even though some studies related to the paint were reported with brief results in the ice trial test hoffmann 1986 kivimaa 1992 liukkonen 1988a liukkonen 1988b a long while ago now 40 years later the paint is being supplied exclusively without any improvement of performance but also the vessel operated in ice covered waters is maintained by the repair painting regularly recently the possibility of corrosion of hull and propeller caused by ice protection coating has been raised because ice protection coating is applied immediately after sandblasting the hull without anti rust coating unlike the past 3 5 knots ship operators are operating at higher speeds 10 13 knots in order to increase the economics of operation and demand for the development of new coating materials that can withstand collisions with broken ices and small icebergs is increasing in addition new painting methods are being investigated to allow drifting ice to slide off instead of accumulating on the hull while the ship is stopped and working in the arctic sea there is an increasing demand for the development of new paints and accurate paint performance assessment techniques for icebreakers after an ice class vessel is built at a shipyard the vessel must be moved to the ice covered water and ice trial tests must be conducted to confirm her ice capabilities in the test the most dominant factor is the ice resistance and breaking performance of the vessel the abrasion and friction performances of the ice protection paints might occupy most of the resistance capability of the vessel while the hull form of vessels has a strong influence on the breaking capability in this paper current evaluation techniques of polar paints were investigated based on the research history of polar paints and the recent trends in the introduction and their limitations were analyzed through this analysis experimental setups for ice friction and abrasion test used in this study and test methods developed in this study were described ice friction tests are carried out by flat plates coated with actual ice protection coating ipc medium bonding coating mbc and anti fouling coating afc in addition ice abrasion tests are also carried out with same plates used at the ice friction tests to verify the abrasion characteristics of three different coatings effectively surface roughness and coating thickness were also measured lastly the results of ice abrasion test and its behavior were analyzed and future research plans were introduced in the conclusion 2 current evaluation methods for polar paint the method for testing and evaluating the physical properties of coatings for ice breaking ships is temporarily used on the evaluation of properties for general marine coatings the measurement of roughness of the upper coating surface the measurement of frictional force with ice the abrasion resistance with ice and ice impact and adhesion capacities are tested for each paint company in the case of surface roughness it is basically measured by contact method using a stylus the contact method however can cause damage to the hull as well as increase the error depending on the condition of the stylus besides the measured result may vary greatly depending on the measurement setting and conditions of the instrument in recent micro surface roughness is measured and imaged using a laser based non contact type sensor in the common sense the smaller the roughness of the coating makes the better the ice friction performance the low friction performance of coatings for ice breaking ships is evaluated by measuring friction force using cold ice and calculating frictional coefficient in particular all ice tanks have their own friction test method and lots of data for controlling the coefficient of friction with wooden model ships also the international towing tank conference ittc recommends standard ice friction coefficients for the performance evaluation of ice breaking ships ittc 1996 but the test method for the low friction performance of coatings on steel plate is not clearly defined only a few examples of such friction experiments in ice tanks can be found tan 2018 cho et al 2019a it can be assumed that ice friction performance for paint is tested and evaluated in a manner similar to the coefficient of friction of model ships and model ice but no exact test procedure has been reported the international standard organization iso has proposed an abrasion test using abrasive rubber wheels for evaluating the abrasion resistance of polar paints in each coating company it is reported that the taber abrasion tester is rotated about 1000 times using a cs17 grade grinding rubber wheel and then the abrasion amount and abrasion resistance are tested and evaluated by changing the weight of the coating film tan 2018 however no correlation data between cs17 grade rubber wheel and actual sea ice has been reported the impact resistance evaluation for the polar paint is carried out through the drop test specified by iso iso 2011 the cone shaped weight is dropped on the coating film and the distortion and cracking of the coating film are inspected repeated tests are carried out while increasing the drop height until fracture occurs and the fracture energy is calculated to evaluate the impact resistance of the polar paint the adhesion performance of the polar paint is evaluated in the same manner as the evaluation of the adhesion performance of the general paint iso 2016 a circular dolly is adhered to the upper surface of the coatings and then the pressure applied to the dolly is measured by applying pressure to the coating surface to calculate the adhesion force and evaluate the adhesion performance 3 experimental setups 3 1 coated plates the abrasion test was carried out with actual coating materials that are painted on steel plates for ship the steel plates are 2000 mm in length 400 mm in breadth and 10 mm thickness to secure enough measurement distance all the steel plates in this study was sandblasted before the painting as well as carefully painted according to the painting procedure by the paint company the ipc is a paint that plays a major role in protecting the ship hull from ice sheets in thearctic sea and reducing friction between the ice and the hull the specimen for ipc is prepared to paint out common ice protection coating only it is about 500 μm thick and was specially coated using a two component sprayer at a time its surface is very shiny and shaped like a glass film no defects such as runs sags brush mark bleeding wrinkles cluster were found on the surface the specimen for mbc was added with adhesion coatings on the plate which is made the same as the specimen for ipc in essence mbc is a coating material that acts as an adhesive in the middle because it can not paint afc directly over ipc it is coated about 100 μm thick and the film thickness was finally coated about 600 μm including ipc the last specimen for afc was added with anti fouling coatings on the mbc plate it was coated with 150 μm thickness of anti fouling coating therefore total thickness of the afc is about 750 μm it is a reddish color similar to ipc but with a slightly rougher surface than ipc all the painting procedure was finished the same as the actual procedure at shipyard and the specimens were dried sufficiently before the test figs 1 and 2 shows three different coating specimens and a cross sectional schematic of each coating specimens in this study respectively 3 2 model ice to implement ice friction and abrasion phenomena on the hull coating of the ice class vessel the ethylene glycol aliphatic detergent eg ad model ice was used the model ice is columnar type and more than 200 ice sheets have been testing at korea research institute of ships ocean engineering kriso for 8 years the mechanical properties of the ice must be uniform and the repeatability of its preparation should be good because many friction and abrasion repeat tests must be conducted for a long time the thickness of the model ice were about 30 50 mm and the ice was cut off by 200 mm long by 200 mm wide because the frictional coefficient does not depend on the flexural strength of the ice cho et al 2011 the flexural strength of the ice were measured as 100 120 kpa its density was about 900 kg m3 and the ice sheet used is shown in fig 3 the model ice used in this study was measured to have uniformity within 2 of error in ice thickness ice strength and density 3 3 friction measurement device new ice friction measurement device was upgraded to measure the frictional coefficient between the various materials and the ice as shown in fig 4 this device can move up to 2 m and measures the friction force of the plate over the ice the tray that holds the sample of the ice is moved along a rack pinion system by an electric motor in order to reduce mechanical vibrations and aliment error the normal load is provided by a deadweight and a rubber pad between ice and the deadweight prevents deformation of ice two sensors are located on both side of ice measure each friction force when the tray go back and forth the frictional coefficient between ice and sample plate can be expressed as a combination of the measured friction force ff the weight of deadweight wd the weight of ice wi and the weight of rubber pad wr 1 μ f f w d w i w r 3 4 surface roughness measurement device the friction and abrasion characteristics with ice depend on the roughness of the coating surface therefore the surface roughness of the plates was measured by using the mitutoyo sj 210 iso1997 the surftest sj 210 is a shop floor type of surface roughness measuring instrument before the measurement we conducted the calibration of the sj 210 with a calibration stage and obtained high accuracy in detail the measurement length and the number were 0 8 mm and 5 times respectively fig 5 shows the measurement of surface roughness by the sj 210 4 test descriptions no actual regulations or procedures related to the ice friction and abrasion test of the coating materials for ice class vessels were investigated paint manufacturer does not put much emphasis on research and development of paint product for the ice class vessels because there is not much demand even though the unit price is more expensive than the price of common paints for the non ice class vessels currently it is still in business with early developed coatings and experiences in ice model basins a frictional coefficient between a ship model and model ice is measured and utilized as one of correction factor absolutely the ship model is made of wood and the painted coating is also common for wood however the research of ice friction and abrasion area for actual paint product on steel is rarely reported the abrasion test procedure for actual paint product is mainly developed in this study the whole procedure is as follow see fig 6 the surface roughness and coating thickness at 50 point of each three specimen plate were measured before the test r0 after those measurements the friction tests for frictional coefficient between each plate and model ice were carried out f0 after the friction test the first abrasion test was carried out for 3 km of an abrasion distance with model ice a1 after the first abrasion test the friction test was carried out again to measure differences f1 and tested plated were sufficiently dried for 2 3 days d1 because the surface of the specimen is wet the dried plate was again measured for surface roughness and coating thickness r1 this cycle was repeated four times and total 12 km of abrasion phenomena was implemented a4 f4 d4 r4 4 1 surface roughness measurement procedure hull roughness and coating thickness were measured only in the position where ice wear and ice friction occurred at 50 points per each plate 5ⅹ10 as shown in fig 7 marking on the plate where actual wear occurs for roughness measurements will affect ice wear and friction therefore simple positions were marked on the side of the plate and 50 points were arbitrarily selected and measured very carefully to prevent damage to the paint due to the measurement table 1 shows the major roughness parameters and their definitions ra is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the evaluation profile deviations from the mean line and rq is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviation from the mean line to the evaluation profile even if they have the same ra value a large friction force is generated at a large rq rsk represents the degree of bias either in the upward or downward direction of an amplitude distribution curve the reference value is zero as the rsk increases a large friction force usually acts rku represents the degree of concentration around the mean line of an amplitude distribution curve the reference value is 3 as the rsk increases the kurtosis increases so the frictional force increases rsm refer to a measure of the horizontal or lateral periodic characteristics of the surface is the arithmetic mean of the width of each profile element 4 2 ice abrasion test procedure ice abrasion phenomena was implemented by the friction measurement device as shown in fig 8 the ambient temperature at which the test was conducted was 3 1 c and the most ice abrasion was implemented in wet condition because the ice melted even though the ice abrasion in the first few meters was moved in dry condition in addition various ice abrasion conditions between a ship and broken ice sheets occur in actual ice waters however only full surface contact conditions were considered to perform a quantitative test in this study the model ice 0 2 mⅹ0 2 m was placed on the specimen and a normal load was applied by using a rubber pad and weight 10 kg the tray where the specimen is located is moved to the left and right with a 0 3 m s of speed one way travel distance is 2 m and reciprocating distance is 4 m after the abrasion test with one side of the model ice was carried out 50 times the other abrasion test was performed with other side of the ice therefore 100 times abrasion was conducted with a model ice sheet in conclusion total 8 model ice sheets were used and the abrasion distance is converted to about 3 km in a cycle 4 3 ice friction test procedure the ice friction test was carried out almost the same as the ice abrasion test however at the initial ice friction test f0 100 ml of water was sprayed on the specimen surface to make the wet condition and subsequent tests f1 f4 automatically satisfied the wet condition due to the melted water during the ice abrasion test in addition only top surface of ice sheet in contact with air was used to secure the reliability of the test normal loads and tray speed varied with 2 8 kg and 0 3 0 6 m s respectively totally three times reciprocating drive were performed and the data were averaged except acceleration and deceleration sections 4 4 test matrix in this study each of the three coated plated was tested sequentially from the phase 0 to the phase 4 although this research has been conducted by repeating ice abrasion test ice friction test drying and roughness measurement the actual time taken for the whole test was about 7 weeks in the case of phase 0 the test 1 3 all three coated plates were subjected to ice friction test using one ice sheet after the test 4 it took a lot of time because the test was carried out using one ice sheet for each coated plate table 2 shows the test matrix according to the test sequence 5 test results fig 9 shows the frictional coefficient between each plate and ices depending on the distance of ice abrasion the frictional coefficient is increasing in the order of ipc afc mbc and the frictional coefficient of ipc is gradually increasing as the ice abrasion progresses there was no big change in the frictional coefficient of afc in the case of mbc it was slightly decreased step by step then suddenly increased rapidly after 6 km of abrasion test and the value tends to decrease again therefore it was found that the friction effect was different depending on the ice wear phenomena according to the coating material 5 1 ipc ipc is very smooth and hard surface like a glass screen before abrasion test because of the solvent free epoxy material there were no major scratches on the first abrasion test however very small scratches of about 30 mm long occurred in the direction of abrasion with the ice after the 3 km of abrasion test the amount of scratches slightly increased about 2 times as the 6 km of abrasion test proceeded however peeling of the coating surface did not occur during the 9 km of abrasion test the abrasion behavior of the ipc coating surface was different from scratch to peeling in particular it was confirmed that the coating was peeled off mainly on the part where the scratches were concentrated and a slight scratch was formed in the place where ice abrasion were newly developed finally it can be seen that the range of peeling is further extended after the 12 km of abrasion test fortunately no flaking and scaling of the coating was found however the frictional coefficient is getting larger as the ice abrasion occurs more and does not indicate where the saturation value is within 12 km of abrasion test see fig 10 because the standard for frictional coefficient has not been established and the demands of customers such as shipyards are also different when performing an ice model test each facility performs and analyzed ice model tests in a unique way while adjusting the frictional coefficient with ice from 0 05 to 0 1 jones 2005 proposed that the ship s resistance could change by 20 depending on the frictional coefficient recently cho et al 2019b also reported that when the frictional coefficient is 0 1 or more the resistance increases by 50 or more in addition it has been investigated that the coefficient can be increased up to about 0 3 due to hull corrosion mäkinen et al 1975 in the case of ipc which has been coated immediately the coefficient forms a very low value of 0 01 and after ice abrasion of 9 km it is increasing to the recommended value of ittc 0 05 although no further experiments were conducted the coefficient would have been greater than 0 1 if ice abrasion had progressed further this means that from the ship s point of view a very large increase in resistance occurs and it is difficult to break the ice sheet resulting in deterioration of energy efficiency the average surface roughness parameters at 50 points for ipc were summarized in tables 3 and 4 four amplitude parameters ra rq rp rv were measured to have a very high correlation with each other at each phase indicating that there was no problem with the measurement procedure on the other hand there is no significant relationship between amplitude parameters height characteristics parameters and spacing parameter as ice abrasion progresses all the amplitude parameters continue to increase in particular rp and rv are changing in proportion to the frictional coefficient change in general the amplitude parameter is a factor that greatly affects the frictional coefficient vuorio 1975 cho et al 2013 but is not absolute it is also found that the height characteristics parameters partially affect the frictional coefficient even if rp or rv is small when rsk has a positive phase 2 or when rku is larger phase 3 it may lead to an increase in the frictional coefficient the spacing parameter does not show a significant influence on frictional coefficient the rate of change of the amplitude parameters p h a s e 4 p h a s e 0 p h a s e 4 100 and rsk was positively large however the rate of change of rku was small due to ice abrasion changes in roughness parameters were larger in the y direction than in the x direction that is the surface roughness changes as the ipc surface is actually peeled off due to contact with ice and the change occurs slightly larger in the direction crossing the abrasion direction than the abrasion progression direction 5 2 mbc because the mbc is a white it is difficult to detect the change with the naked eye even when the ice abrasion progresses and therefore each step was not recorded as a photograph the mbc had fewer scratches or peels than the other two coatings and did not show any significant change in appearance finally after 12 km of abrasion test a slight scratch of about 30 mm long was generated see fig 11 since the mbc has a very high level of roughness as compared with the ice protection paint the frictional coefficient is formed to be large as shown in table 5 and fig 9 the frictional coefficient tended to decrease after phase 1 and then rise suddenly this dramatic change in frictional coefficient seems to be determined by the complex changes in surface roughness parameters and their combinations vuorio 1975 cho et al 2013 that is as the amplitude parameter decreases at 3 km the frictional coefficient also tends to decrease on the other hand it can be seen that at 6 km the amplitude parameter increases again and rsk changes from negative to positive resulting in a sharp increase in the frictional coefficient the mbc is an adhesive paint and because it has a very large frictional force it is considered to have a completely different abrasion characteristics from ipc besides it may take more force in ship than estimated resistance if mbc is exposed during actual sea ice operation therefore icebreakers should be operated at rated capacity with the afc and mbc completely peeled off and further consideration should be given to the applicability of the mbc the average surface roughness parameters at 50 points for mbc were summarized in tables 5 and 6 four amplitude parameters were also measured to have a very high correlation similarly to ipc on the other hand there is no significant relationship between each major parameter mainly the frictional coefficient is changing in proportion to rp in addition since rp is relatively larger than that of ipc and afc the rate of change due to ice abrasion was calculated to be small it was confirmed that the frictional coefficient can be partially controlled by height characteristics parameters like ipc even if rp is similar 5 109 at phase 0 and 5 155 at phase 3 when rsk is negative the frictional coefficient decreases and when rsk is positive the coefficient tends to increase the spacing parameter also does not show a significant influence on frictional coefficient the rate of change of all the parameters was almost small as ice abrasion progressed there was no significant change in the x and y directions that is the abrasion due to contact with ice did not actually occur much and when some scratches occurred the coefficient increased significantly but it is not seen as due to abrasion the coefficient may change depending on the range of exposure of the adhesive component of the paint 5 3 afc the afc is a red based paint similar in color to the ipc but does not have a solid feel on the surface the surface roughness was intermediate between surface roughnesses of ipc and mbc and the scratches on the surface did not occur but the coating surface was peeled off as if it were being ground one by one as ice abrasion progressed it was checked that peeling occurred from the time of 3 km of ice abrasion and the range became gradually larger after 6 km of ice abrasion we could see that the paint was pushed out in black dust form due to abrasion as shown in fig 12 the average surface roughness parameters for afc were summarized in tables 7 and 8 the correlation of each surface roughness parameter is similar to that of ipc and mbc the frictional coefficient also showed a tendency to change by the combination of amplitude parameters especially rp and rv and height characteristics parameters that is even if rp is small when rku is larger the coefficient is increased the rate of change of almost parameters was negatively large unlike ipc this means that the afc paint particles became smooth due to the abrasive surface falling off due to abrasion with ice due to ice abrasion changes in roughness parameters occurred slightly larger in the y direction than in the x direction although contact and abrasion with ice actually occurs it does not occur as much as ipc due to the characteristics of the afc small particles are divided and separated showing a slight change and as a result a change in the frictional coefficient was not very large 6 conclusions a test method was newly developed to identify the ice friction and abrasion mechanisms of polar paints applied to ice breaking ships and offshore structures operating in the arctic and the frictional coefficient change according to ice abrasion was measured and analyzed in this study in order to develop a new test method a commercial polar paint was applied to a real steel plate in a similar way to a real one and ice abrasion events were generated using cold model ice in addition the change of ice frictional coefficient according to ice abrasion was measured and analyzed for the correlation through the photographing of coating surface measurement of surface roughness and precise friction force measurement as ice abrasion progresses roughness changes due to damage to the coating surface and roughness parameters change the frictional coefficient of the ipc was the lowest at most ice abrasion event or distances however the frictional coefficient of ipc is gradually increasing as the ice abrasion progresses relatively the frictional coefficient of afc was maintained without significant change depending on the coating materials the abrasion characteristics with ice were different all paints showed a deep correlation between amplitude parameters but did not show a great correlation with other major parameters in addition the frictional coefficient generally showed a tendency to change by the combination of amplitude parameters especially rp and rv and height characteristics parameters in general due to ice abrasion changes in roughness parameters were larger in the y direction than in the x direction but the mbc did not show a distinct difference the abrasion type was different depending on the paint material due to peeling small scratches grinding or peeling of specific paint components due to ice abrasion therefore it was confirmed that the ice friction and abrasion behavior varies depending on the abrasion type through the frictional coefficient we would like to limit the results of this experiment since it was a perfect surface surface contact condition it can show different results in actual phenomena in addition a very large load is applied to the coating in the real sea condition but further research is needed because the vertical load of about 10 kg is applied in this experiment however the ice frictional force and coefficient increase rapidly with only 12 km of ice abrasion this may lead to a sharp increase in ice frictional resistance for ships operating in the ice covered water which is considered to be an important issue that may cause hull damage this means that the evaluation of abrasion performance of polar paints developed in the 1970s has not yet been accurately validated indicating the absence of systematic ice friction and abrasion tests in recent years there is an increasing demand for enhancing the corrosion resistance of polar paint improving impact resistance against collisions with large icebergs securing antifouling performance for invasive aquatic organisms and improving low friction performance due to increased ship speed therefore systematic development of relevant test methods is needed

21684,this study describes a new assessment technique for evaluating marine coating performance on ice the current evaluation methods related to the ice friction performance are investigated and their limitations are analyzed to ensure the accuracy and validity of the study ice abrasion specimens were prepared using paints applied to actual ice class vessels instead of the commonly used rubber material roller the cold model ice was used as the corresponding abrasion materials on the coating to assess ice friction and abrasion performance a new test procedures are developed abrasion was generated in the unit of abrasion distance of about 3 km per coating and abrasion was finally generated up to about 12 km as the ice abrasion progressed scratches and peelings occurred on the surface of the ipc therefore it was found that the surface roughness and frictional coefficient of the ipc gradually increased afc on the other hand tended to separate like dust as the surface coatings were ground on ice and the surface roughness but also frictional coefficient did not change significantly it was confirmed that the ice abrasion phenomena were different according to the type of paints and the ice friction performance effect of the marine coating could be varied keywords ice friction ice abrasion marine coating for ice class vessels surface roughness 1 introduction ship resistances in ice covered waters not only are very bulky compared with the resistance in open water but also change with dramatic fluctuations according to the ice conditions of the contact many researches to inquire into ice resistances closely had been studied for long kashteljan et al 1968 vance 1975 valanto cho and lee 2015 and the ice resistance is analyzed into ice breaking resistance ice buoyancy resistance and ice friction resistance frictional coefficient of hull is changed by ice abrasion so if the frictional coefficient of hull is changed the ice resistance of the ship is also affected needs to develop the arctic sea are increasing due to the possibility of economic northern sea route nsr and climate changes and various operating systems such as icebreaker assistance and safe navigation supporting system are also developed for safe sailing in the nsr therefore the ice breaking performance of ships will not be important like the present but also a fleet of transportation ships with assisted icebreakers will often sail in the nsr besides broken ice floes generated near the bow of ships do not move to the bottom of ships because of the recent advance of hull forms so that the effect of an ice buoyance resistance is smaller and smaller finally the friction and abrasion performances of ships will be so dominant and hot to estimate an icebreaker s performance and the friction phenomena and mechanism with ice is needed to study and develop in the early 1970s research on the frictional resistance in ice is still in its early stage but also the paint for ice class vessels has never been studied so far only anti fouling coating was coated on the hull surface because there was no paint that could survive with ice it was reported that the anti fouling coating were worn away during first few days in ice covered waters and the hull was corroded in places sodhi 1995 finally it is gradually covered to the whole surface and would greatly affect ship s speed in 1973 teknos first developed the inerta160 that can withstand with ice collisions www teknos co kr company and jotun also released the paint for ice class vessels www jotun com no studies have ever tried to examine an ice abrasion test with paints for ice class vessels even though some studies related to the paint were reported with brief results in the ice trial test hoffmann 1986 kivimaa 1992 liukkonen 1988a liukkonen 1988b a long while ago now 40 years later the paint is being supplied exclusively without any improvement of performance but also the vessel operated in ice covered waters is maintained by the repair painting regularly recently the possibility of corrosion of hull and propeller caused by ice protection coating has been raised because ice protection coating is applied immediately after sandblasting the hull without anti rust coating unlike the past 3 5 knots ship operators are operating at higher speeds 10 13 knots in order to increase the economics of operation and demand for the development of new coating materials that can withstand collisions with broken ices and small icebergs is increasing in addition new painting methods are being investigated to allow drifting ice to slide off instead of accumulating on the hull while the ship is stopped and working in the arctic sea there is an increasing demand for the development of new paints and accurate paint performance assessment techniques for icebreakers after an ice class vessel is built at a shipyard the vessel must be moved to the ice covered water and ice trial tests must be conducted to confirm her ice capabilities in the test the most dominant factor is the ice resistance and breaking performance of the vessel the abrasion and friction performances of the ice protection paints might occupy most of the resistance capability of the vessel while the hull form of vessels has a strong influence on the breaking capability in this paper current evaluation techniques of polar paints were investigated based on the research history of polar paints and the recent trends in the introduction and their limitations were analyzed through this analysis experimental setups for ice friction and abrasion test used in this study and test methods developed in this study were described ice friction tests are carried out by flat plates coated with actual ice protection coating ipc medium bonding coating mbc and anti fouling coating afc in addition ice abrasion tests are also carried out with same plates used at the ice friction tests to verify the abrasion characteristics of three different coatings effectively surface roughness and coating thickness were also measured lastly the results of ice abrasion test and its behavior were analyzed and future research plans were introduced in the conclusion 2 current evaluation methods for polar paint the method for testing and evaluating the physical properties of coatings for ice breaking ships is temporarily used on the evaluation of properties for general marine coatings the measurement of roughness of the upper coating surface the measurement of frictional force with ice the abrasion resistance with ice and ice impact and adhesion capacities are tested for each paint company in the case of surface roughness it is basically measured by contact method using a stylus the contact method however can cause damage to the hull as well as increase the error depending on the condition of the stylus besides the measured result may vary greatly depending on the measurement setting and conditions of the instrument in recent micro surface roughness is measured and imaged using a laser based non contact type sensor in the common sense the smaller the roughness of the coating makes the better the ice friction performance the low friction performance of coatings for ice breaking ships is evaluated by measuring friction force using cold ice and calculating frictional coefficient in particular all ice tanks have their own friction test method and lots of data for controlling the coefficient of friction with wooden model ships also the international towing tank conference ittc recommends standard ice friction coefficients for the performance evaluation of ice breaking ships ittc 1996 but the test method for the low friction performance of coatings on steel plate is not clearly defined only a few examples of such friction experiments in ice tanks can be found tan 2018 cho et al 2019a it can be assumed that ice friction performance for paint is tested and evaluated in a manner similar to the coefficient of friction of model ships and model ice but no exact test procedure has been reported the international standard organization iso has proposed an abrasion test using abrasive rubber wheels for evaluating the abrasion resistance of polar paints in each coating company it is reported that the taber abrasion tester is rotated about 1000 times using a cs17 grade grinding rubber wheel and then the abrasion amount and abrasion resistance are tested and evaluated by changing the weight of the coating film tan 2018 however no correlation data between cs17 grade rubber wheel and actual sea ice has been reported the impact resistance evaluation for the polar paint is carried out through the drop test specified by iso iso 2011 the cone shaped weight is dropped on the coating film and the distortion and cracking of the coating film are inspected repeated tests are carried out while increasing the drop height until fracture occurs and the fracture energy is calculated to evaluate the impact resistance of the polar paint the adhesion performance of the polar paint is evaluated in the same manner as the evaluation of the adhesion performance of the general paint iso 2016 a circular dolly is adhered to the upper surface of the coatings and then the pressure applied to the dolly is measured by applying pressure to the coating surface to calculate the adhesion force and evaluate the adhesion performance 3 experimental setups 3 1 coated plates the abrasion test was carried out with actual coating materials that are painted on steel plates for ship the steel plates are 2000 mm in length 400 mm in breadth and 10 mm thickness to secure enough measurement distance all the steel plates in this study was sandblasted before the painting as well as carefully painted according to the painting procedure by the paint company the ipc is a paint that plays a major role in protecting the ship hull from ice sheets in thearctic sea and reducing friction between the ice and the hull the specimen for ipc is prepared to paint out common ice protection coating only it is about 500 μm thick and was specially coated using a two component sprayer at a time its surface is very shiny and shaped like a glass film no defects such as runs sags brush mark bleeding wrinkles cluster were found on the surface the specimen for mbc was added with adhesion coatings on the plate which is made the same as the specimen for ipc in essence mbc is a coating material that acts as an adhesive in the middle because it can not paint afc directly over ipc it is coated about 100 μm thick and the film thickness was finally coated about 600 μm including ipc the last specimen for afc was added with anti fouling coatings on the mbc plate it was coated with 150 μm thickness of anti fouling coating therefore total thickness of the afc is about 750 μm it is a reddish color similar to ipc but with a slightly rougher surface than ipc all the painting procedure was finished the same as the actual procedure at shipyard and the specimens were dried sufficiently before the test figs 1 and 2 shows three different coating specimens and a cross sectional schematic of each coating specimens in this study respectively 3 2 model ice to implement ice friction and abrasion phenomena on the hull coating of the ice class vessel the ethylene glycol aliphatic detergent eg ad model ice was used the model ice is columnar type and more than 200 ice sheets have been testing at korea research institute of ships ocean engineering kriso for 8 years the mechanical properties of the ice must be uniform and the repeatability of its preparation should be good because many friction and abrasion repeat tests must be conducted for a long time the thickness of the model ice were about 30 50 mm and the ice was cut off by 200 mm long by 200 mm wide because the frictional coefficient does not depend on the flexural strength of the ice cho et al 2011 the flexural strength of the ice were measured as 100 120 kpa its density was about 900 kg m3 and the ice sheet used is shown in fig 3 the model ice used in this study was measured to have uniformity within 2 of error in ice thickness ice strength and density 3 3 friction measurement device new ice friction measurement device was upgraded to measure the frictional coefficient between the various materials and the ice as shown in fig 4 this device can move up to 2 m and measures the friction force of the plate over the ice the tray that holds the sample of the ice is moved along a rack pinion system by an electric motor in order to reduce mechanical vibrations and aliment error the normal load is provided by a deadweight and a rubber pad between ice and the deadweight prevents deformation of ice two sensors are located on both side of ice measure each friction force when the tray go back and forth the frictional coefficient between ice and sample plate can be expressed as a combination of the measured friction force ff the weight of deadweight wd the weight of ice wi and the weight of rubber pad wr 1 μ f f w d w i w r 3 4 surface roughness measurement device the friction and abrasion characteristics with ice depend on the roughness of the coating surface therefore the surface roughness of the plates was measured by using the mitutoyo sj 210 iso1997 the surftest sj 210 is a shop floor type of surface roughness measuring instrument before the measurement we conducted the calibration of the sj 210 with a calibration stage and obtained high accuracy in detail the measurement length and the number were 0 8 mm and 5 times respectively fig 5 shows the measurement of surface roughness by the sj 210 4 test descriptions no actual regulations or procedures related to the ice friction and abrasion test of the coating materials for ice class vessels were investigated paint manufacturer does not put much emphasis on research and development of paint product for the ice class vessels because there is not much demand even though the unit price is more expensive than the price of common paints for the non ice class vessels currently it is still in business with early developed coatings and experiences in ice model basins a frictional coefficient between a ship model and model ice is measured and utilized as one of correction factor absolutely the ship model is made of wood and the painted coating is also common for wood however the research of ice friction and abrasion area for actual paint product on steel is rarely reported the abrasion test procedure for actual paint product is mainly developed in this study the whole procedure is as follow see fig 6 the surface roughness and coating thickness at 50 point of each three specimen plate were measured before the test r0 after those measurements the friction tests for frictional coefficient between each plate and model ice were carried out f0 after the friction test the first abrasion test was carried out for 3 km of an abrasion distance with model ice a1 after the first abrasion test the friction test was carried out again to measure differences f1 and tested plated were sufficiently dried for 2 3 days d1 because the surface of the specimen is wet the dried plate was again measured for surface roughness and coating thickness r1 this cycle was repeated four times and total 12 km of abrasion phenomena was implemented a4 f4 d4 r4 4 1 surface roughness measurement procedure hull roughness and coating thickness were measured only in the position where ice wear and ice friction occurred at 50 points per each plate 5ⅹ10 as shown in fig 7 marking on the plate where actual wear occurs for roughness measurements will affect ice wear and friction therefore simple positions were marked on the side of the plate and 50 points were arbitrarily selected and measured very carefully to prevent damage to the paint due to the measurement table 1 shows the major roughness parameters and their definitions ra is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the evaluation profile deviations from the mean line and rq is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviation from the mean line to the evaluation profile even if they have the same ra value a large friction force is generated at a large rq rsk represents the degree of bias either in the upward or downward direction of an amplitude distribution curve the reference value is zero as the rsk increases a large friction force usually acts rku represents the degree of concentration around the mean line of an amplitude distribution curve the reference value is 3 as the rsk increases the kurtosis increases so the frictional force increases rsm refer to a measure of the horizontal or lateral periodic characteristics of the surface is the arithmetic mean of the width of each profile element 4 2 ice abrasion test procedure ice abrasion phenomena was implemented by the friction measurement device as shown in fig 8 the ambient temperature at which the test was conducted was 3 1 c and the most ice abrasion was implemented in wet condition because the ice melted even though the ice abrasion in the first few meters was moved in dry condition in addition various ice abrasion conditions between a ship and broken ice sheets occur in actual ice waters however only full surface contact conditions were considered to perform a quantitative test in this study the model ice 0 2 mⅹ0 2 m was placed on the specimen and a normal load was applied by using a rubber pad and weight 10 kg the tray where the specimen is located is moved to the left and right with a 0 3 m s of speed one way travel distance is 2 m and reciprocating distance is 4 m after the abrasion test with one side of the model ice was carried out 50 times the other abrasion test was performed with other side of the ice therefore 100 times abrasion was conducted with a model ice sheet in conclusion total 8 model ice sheets were used and the abrasion distance is converted to about 3 km in a cycle 4 3 ice friction test procedure the ice friction test was carried out almost the same as the ice abrasion test however at the initial ice friction test f0 100 ml of water was sprayed on the specimen surface to make the wet condition and subsequent tests f1 f4 automatically satisfied the wet condition due to the melted water during the ice abrasion test in addition only top surface of ice sheet in contact with air was used to secure the reliability of the test normal loads and tray speed varied with 2 8 kg and 0 3 0 6 m s respectively totally three times reciprocating drive were performed and the data were averaged except acceleration and deceleration sections 4 4 test matrix in this study each of the three coated plated was tested sequentially from the phase 0 to the phase 4 although this research has been conducted by repeating ice abrasion test ice friction test drying and roughness measurement the actual time taken for the whole test was about 7 weeks in the case of phase 0 the test 1 3 all three coated plates were subjected to ice friction test using one ice sheet after the test 4 it took a lot of time because the test was carried out using one ice sheet for each coated plate table 2 shows the test matrix according to the test sequence 5 test results fig 9 shows the frictional coefficient between each plate and ices depending on the distance of ice abrasion the frictional coefficient is increasing in the order of ipc afc mbc and the frictional coefficient of ipc is gradually increasing as the ice abrasion progresses there was no big change in the frictional coefficient of afc in the case of mbc it was slightly decreased step by step then suddenly increased rapidly after 6 km of abrasion test and the value tends to decrease again therefore it was found that the friction effect was different depending on the ice wear phenomena according to the coating material 5 1 ipc ipc is very smooth and hard surface like a glass screen before abrasion test because of the solvent free epoxy material there were no major scratches on the first abrasion test however very small scratches of about 30 mm long occurred in the direction of abrasion with the ice after the 3 km of abrasion test the amount of scratches slightly increased about 2 times as the 6 km of abrasion test proceeded however peeling of the coating surface did not occur during the 9 km of abrasion test the abrasion behavior of the ipc coating surface was different from scratch to peeling in particular it was confirmed that the coating was peeled off mainly on the part where the scratches were concentrated and a slight scratch was formed in the place where ice abrasion were newly developed finally it can be seen that the range of peeling is further extended after the 12 km of abrasion test fortunately no flaking and scaling of the coating was found however the frictional coefficient is getting larger as the ice abrasion occurs more and does not indicate where the saturation value is within 12 km of abrasion test see fig 10 because the standard for frictional coefficient has not been established and the demands of customers such as shipyards are also different when performing an ice model test each facility performs and analyzed ice model tests in a unique way while adjusting the frictional coefficient with ice from 0 05 to 0 1 jones 2005 proposed that the ship s resistance could change by 20 depending on the frictional coefficient recently cho et al 2019b also reported that when the frictional coefficient is 0 1 or more the resistance increases by 50 or more in addition it has been investigated that the coefficient can be increased up to about 0 3 due to hull corrosion mäkinen et al 1975 in the case of ipc which has been coated immediately the coefficient forms a very low value of 0 01 and after ice abrasion of 9 km it is increasing to the recommended value of ittc 0 05 although no further experiments were conducted the coefficient would have been greater than 0 1 if ice abrasion had progressed further this means that from the ship s point of view a very large increase in resistance occurs and it is difficult to break the ice sheet resulting in deterioration of energy efficiency the average surface roughness parameters at 50 points for ipc were summarized in tables 3 and 4 four amplitude parameters ra rq rp rv were measured to have a very high correlation with each other at each phase indicating that there was no problem with the measurement procedure on the other hand there is no significant relationship between amplitude parameters height characteristics parameters and spacing parameter as ice abrasion progresses all the amplitude parameters continue to increase in particular rp and rv are changing in proportion to the frictional coefficient change in general the amplitude parameter is a factor that greatly affects the frictional coefficient vuorio 1975 cho et al 2013 but is not absolute it is also found that the height characteristics parameters partially affect the frictional coefficient even if rp or rv is small when rsk has a positive phase 2 or when rku is larger phase 3 it may lead to an increase in the frictional coefficient the spacing parameter does not show a significant influence on frictional coefficient the rate of change of the amplitude parameters p h a s e 4 p h a s e 0 p h a s e 4 100 and rsk was positively large however the rate of change of rku was small due to ice abrasion changes in roughness parameters were larger in the y direction than in the x direction that is the surface roughness changes as the ipc surface is actually peeled off due to contact with ice and the change occurs slightly larger in the direction crossing the abrasion direction than the abrasion progression direction 5 2 mbc because the mbc is a white it is difficult to detect the change with the naked eye even when the ice abrasion progresses and therefore each step was not recorded as a photograph the mbc had fewer scratches or peels than the other two coatings and did not show any significant change in appearance finally after 12 km of abrasion test a slight scratch of about 30 mm long was generated see fig 11 since the mbc has a very high level of roughness as compared with the ice protection paint the frictional coefficient is formed to be large as shown in table 5 and fig 9 the frictional coefficient tended to decrease after phase 1 and then rise suddenly this dramatic change in frictional coefficient seems to be determined by the complex changes in surface roughness parameters and their combinations vuorio 1975 cho et al 2013 that is as the amplitude parameter decreases at 3 km the frictional coefficient also tends to decrease on the other hand it can be seen that at 6 km the amplitude parameter increases again and rsk changes from negative to positive resulting in a sharp increase in the frictional coefficient the mbc is an adhesive paint and because it has a very large frictional force it is considered to have a completely different abrasion characteristics from ipc besides it may take more force in ship than estimated resistance if mbc is exposed during actual sea ice operation therefore icebreakers should be operated at rated capacity with the afc and mbc completely peeled off and further consideration should be given to the applicability of the mbc the average surface roughness parameters at 50 points for mbc were summarized in tables 5 and 6 four amplitude parameters were also measured to have a very high correlation similarly to ipc on the other hand there is no significant relationship between each major parameter mainly the frictional coefficient is changing in proportion to rp in addition since rp is relatively larger than that of ipc and afc the rate of change due to ice abrasion was calculated to be small it was confirmed that the frictional coefficient can be partially controlled by height characteristics parameters like ipc even if rp is similar 5 109 at phase 0 and 5 155 at phase 3 when rsk is negative the frictional coefficient decreases and when rsk is positive the coefficient tends to increase the spacing parameter also does not show a significant influence on frictional coefficient the rate of change of all the parameters was almost small as ice abrasion progressed there was no significant change in the x and y directions that is the abrasion due to contact with ice did not actually occur much and when some scratches occurred the coefficient increased significantly but it is not seen as due to abrasion the coefficient may change depending on the range of exposure of the adhesive component of the paint 5 3 afc the afc is a red based paint similar in color to the ipc but does not have a solid feel on the surface the surface roughness was intermediate between surface roughnesses of ipc and mbc and the scratches on the surface did not occur but the coating surface was peeled off as if it were being ground one by one as ice abrasion progressed it was checked that peeling occurred from the time of 3 km of ice abrasion and the range became gradually larger after 6 km of ice abrasion we could see that the paint was pushed out in black dust form due to abrasion as shown in fig 12 the average surface roughness parameters for afc were summarized in tables 7 and 8 the correlation of each surface roughness parameter is similar to that of ipc and mbc the frictional coefficient also showed a tendency to change by the combination of amplitude parameters especially rp and rv and height characteristics parameters that is even if rp is small when rku is larger the coefficient is increased the rate of change of almost parameters was negatively large unlike ipc this means that the afc paint particles became smooth due to the abrasive surface falling off due to abrasion with ice due to ice abrasion changes in roughness parameters occurred slightly larger in the y direction than in the x direction although contact and abrasion with ice actually occurs it does not occur as much as ipc due to the characteristics of the afc small particles are divided and separated showing a slight change and as a result a change in the frictional coefficient was not very large 6 conclusions a test method was newly developed to identify the ice friction and abrasion mechanisms of polar paints applied to ice breaking ships and offshore structures operating in the arctic and the frictional coefficient change according to ice abrasion was measured and analyzed in this study in order to develop a new test method a commercial polar paint was applied to a real steel plate in a similar way

coating in the real sea condition but further research is needed because the vertical load of about 10 kg is applied in this experiment however the ice frictional force and coefficient increase
