corresponding author accurate water level prediction is very important for coastal construction and flood prevention in an estuarine area however it is challenging to represent the water level processes accurately in a spatial domain due to the dual influences of river discharge from the upstream tidal reach upstream discharge and astronomical tides in this study a new method is proposed to predict water levels in tidal reaches by developing a riverine estuary hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling model h2c and integrating the outputs upstream discharge and water levels tidal levels with long short term memory then the relative contribution of upstream discharge to water level predictions is assessed by extreme gradient boosting the coupling model h2c xl is driven by basin scale satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets and tpxo9 tidal data h2c xl is tested in a tidal reach tianhe zhuyin reach and found to be effective in enhancing the accuracy of water level predictions dramatically the nash coefficient and kling gupta efficiency values of predicted upstream discharge are 0 866 and 0 922 respectively accurate upstream discharge prediction is crucial for water level predictions in tidal reaches this is reflected in that the nash coefficient and kling gupta efficiency values are up to 0 781 and 0 806 for predicting water levels at upper hydrologic stations jiangmen and daao stations which are improved by 12 34 40 46 and 16 98 32 34 than those of above models the relative contribution of upstream discharge to water level predictions in tianhe zhuyin reach ranges from 0 37 to 0 55 the values vary at the same site depending on the hydrologic conditions each year and are relatively low near the coastline but nonlinearly increase with the distance from the coastline keywords water level prediction tidal reach hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling model machine learning upstream discharge relative contribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction along with global warming speeding up the pace and extreme weather occurring with increasing frequency and intensity the occurrences of flood disasters in tidal riparian regions have dramatically increased talke and jay 2020 therefore accurate water level predictions of the tidal rivers are crucial in implementing flood control measures and reducing flood losses de dominicis et al 2020 yin et al 2018 the water level of tidal rivers is influenced by both the gravity from sun and moon with a certain periodicity and the upstream discharge the tidal signal is strongly nonstationary due to the combined effects of upstream discharge and tides making it challenging to estimate water levels accurately in tidal reaches cao et al 2020 to interpret the spatiotemporal changes in estuarine water level requires long term measurements and it is hard to achieve a high degree of prediction accuracy guo et al 2015 hydrodynamic models based on the navier stokes equations can simulate the water level processes which have achieved remarkable progress medeiros and hagen 2013 woodruff et al 2013 however to simulate the relatively long term hydrodynamic processes in a large watershed covering both the upstream region and offshore areas using a hydrodynamic model alone is quite time consuming furthermore relying solely on the hydrodynamic modeling and parameter adjusting cannot fully consider hydrological factors for instance if the river discharge from the upper basin is ignored by the hydrodynamic model the predicted water levels in tidal rivers would be underestimated especially during the flood period peng et al 2018 the distributed hydrological model is a good alternative in providing upstream discharge for hydrodynamic models which can predict streamflow on a large scale by adopting satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets luo and zuo 2019 sood and smakhtin 2015 gao et al 2023 considering the importance of upstream discharge for water level prediction in tidal rivers and the wide applicability of hydrological models coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models are necessary to investigate water level processes in tidal rivers nevertheless uncertain boundary conditions model parameterization and structural errors of the coupling model would negatively impact the accuracy of water level simulations alizadeh et al 2021 these model inaccuracies can then contribute to unsatisfactory performance in long term forecasting machine learning methods have been widely used in many fields over recent years feng et al 2020 jin et al 2020 wang et al 2021 for example the long short term memory lstm model can be used to solve the problems of gradient disappearance and explosion in the long term training of recurrent neural network hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 machine learning models can also offer feature importance and non linear relationships such as extreme gradient boosting xgboost however machine learning methods have the limitations that abundant training data in situ are required and they could neither depict the real physical processes reichstein et al 2019 nor represent the out of sample situations accurately sun et al 2021 by integrating the machine learning methods with the physics guided hydrological and hydrodynamic models the limitations of both methods can be reduced the simulation results from the hydrological and hydrodynamic models can provide useful information and input for machine learning algorithms physics guided models are independent of high quality observations and they would provide unprecedented extreme values for machine learning models hence the regional characteristics of the study area can be considered and the generalization capabilities of machine learning methods could be improved guo et al 2022 yaseen et al 2018 by introducing machine learning technology the accuracy of long term predictions from the physics guided models could be enhanced huang et al 2022 zounemat kermani et al 2021 for instance karpatne et al 2017 proposed a physics guided machine learning method which could incorporate the architecture s applicable physical principles into hydrological processes cho and kim 2022 combined weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system and lstm to predict the inflow of soyangho lake konapala et al 2020 developed a hybrid model to simulate streamflow in catchments across the conterminous united states by combining the sacramento soil moisture accounting model and lstm the previous studies showed considerable improvements in the nash sutcliffe efficiency value by combining the machine learning methods with the physics guided models however previous studies mainly focused on streamflow predictions without considering the tidal effects furthermore long term water level predictions based on the physics guided machine learning models in tidal reaches are rarely reported the relative contributions of upstream discharge on water levels in a tidal reach are significant in estuarine areas especially when the upstream discharge is huge jay and flinchem 1997 leonardi et al 2015 the hydrological processes and their spatiotemporal variations in a tidal river could be better investigated by analyzing the relative contributions of upstream discharge cao et al 2020 besides assessing the relative contributions of upstream discharge is instrumental in analyzing the residual water level caused by the strong tide river interaction as there are positive correlations between the two hoitink and jay 2016 therefore as an input feature for predicting the water levels of tidal rivers the relative contribution of upstream discharge needs to be quantified and the affected areas should also be explored by far most studies focused on a single disaster event during a relatively short period using traditional methods for simulating water levels familkhalili et al 2020 gori et al 2020 the studies on long term water level predictions in tidal reaches using the ensemble of the hydrological hydrodynamic coupling model and the machine learning model are limited insufficient research has been carried out on assessing the relative contributions of upstream discharges to water levels as mentioned above a riverine estuary hydrologic and hydrodynamic coupling model h2c is first developed with an emphasis on predicting long term upstream discharge and water level processes in tidal rivers then the outputs of h2c are integrated with lstm and xgboost h2c xl to improve the water level predictions this h2c model is driven by basin scale satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets and tpxo9 tidal data which fully accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological factors of the computing domain and the non linear interactions between upstream discharge and astronomical tides in tidal rivers in particular to which extent the accuracy of water level prediction could be enhanced by integrating the outputs of h2c into machine learning models is estimated which has received little attention in the past relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are quantified by assessing the feature importance using xgboost over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area materials and methods for water level predictions in a selected tidal reach are described in section 3 the predicted water levels by h2c xl are validated based on historical measurement and the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are assessed section 4 discusses the significance of accurate upstream discharge for predicting water level and the advantages and limitations of physics guide machine learning approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and datasets in this study tianhe zhuyin tidal reach which is located in xijiang river basin is selected as the study area with a total length of about 83 km fig 1 the reach has a tropical monsoon climate which is characterized by large river discharge from april to september based on the statistical data of the upstream hydrological station makou hydrological station from 1965 to 2016 according to the report of pearl river water resources commission the average runoff discharges into south china sea through tianhe zhuyin tidal reach are 10810 m3 s and the maximum runoff is 29000 m3 s besides tianhe zhuyin tidal reach is located in the pearl river delta the most economically developed region in china 22 34 22 76 n 113 08 113 31 e which plays a key role as a major shipping route connecting xijiang river basin and south china sea the observed data include the hourly water level observations at jiangmen daao and zhuyin hydrological stations from 2014 4 1 to 2014 9 30 2015 4 20 to 2015 10 19 2016 4 8 to 2016 10 7 hereinafter referred to as 2014 2015 2016 and daily river discharge observations of makou hydrological station from 2009 1 1 to 2016 12 31 the selected periods of tidal cycles in 2014 2015 and 2016 are the same the underwater bathymetry data of tianhe zhuyin tidal reach was measured in 1999 the

evapotranspiration data from famine early warning systems network fews pet both pet and precipitation datasets are the daily estimates the digital elevation model dem of the xijiang river basin is obtained from hydrosheds lehner and grill 2013 time series of tidal level tpxo9 tidal data extracted from texas potsdam nasa 9 tide model data release is used to specify the open boundaries egbert and erofeeva 2018 the flood events are selected according to the china annual water regime report 2 2 riverine estuary hydrological and hydrodynamic coupling model in this study a riverine estuary hydrologic and hydrodynamic coupling model h2c is developed the model engine consists of two components the hydrological model wang et al 2011 that computes excess rainfall and river discharges and a 2d hydrodynamic model du et al 2023 that simulates water level processes by setting the simulated river discharge as the upstream boundary the details of hydrological and hydrodynamic models are shown in the support information text s1 s2 2 3 machine learning models the recurrent neural network rnn is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes can create a cycle lstm is a special rnn algorithm it adds an input gate forgetting gate and output gate to each neuron which can solve the problems of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the process of long term sequence training making full use of the relationship among long term sequences greff et al 2017 the details of lstm are shown in the support information text s3 xgboost is the ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into strong learners in a single weak learner the relative contribution is calculated by the amount that each attribute split point improves the performance measure weighted by the number of observations the node is responsible for the greater the performance of a feature for the split point improvement the greater the weight finally the results of a feature in all weak learners are weighted and then averaged to get the final relative contribution value chen et al 2015 xgboost provides decision trees logistic regression and svm learners the logistic regression algorithm is used in this study the essence of xgboost is to get a certain kind of mapping relation between features and labels the details of xgboost are shown in the support information text s4 2 4 experimental setup the target tianhe zhuyin tidal reach is discretized into a grid with a resolution of 0 0025 0 0025 with 632 cells the h2c xl model is developed by integrating the outputs of h2c with lstm and xgboost the workflow of h2c xl is shown in fig 2 h2c is driven by satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets and tpxo9 tidal data the data provided to lstm and xgboost models are normalized by the min max normalization method 1 predicting upstream discharge by h2c the location of makou station is set to be the upstream boundary for water level simulations the daily upstream discharge is simulated by h2c the calibration period is 2009 1 1 2013 12 31 the infiltration parameters include the exponent of the variable infiltration curve and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity which are based on a priori parameters vergara et al 2016 gao et al 2016 the parameters including maximum soil water capacity impervious area ratio conversion factor from potential evapotranspiration to actual evapotranspiration and initial value of soil water are calibrated by differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm vrugt et al 2009 the optimized parameter values are obtained by maximizing the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient then 2014 and 2015 are selected as the validation period and the upstream discharge in 2016 is predicted by h2c 2 predicting water levels by h2c the water levels in 632 cells can be simulated using h2c the simulation period is from 2014 to 2016 the river discharge observations in 2014 and 2015 and improved upstream discharge in 2016 are inputs for the upstream boundary of the hydrodynamic model the manning s n coefficient is manually calibrated based on yang et al 2019 and garzon and ferreira 2016 the target is to make nse values exceeding 0 75 at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations the tidal levels in each cell can be simulated by setting the upstream discharge to 0 the simulated tidal levels are validated by water level observations at dahengqin station where the water level is not affected by upstream discharges the upstream discharge surges at jiangmen and zhuyin hydrological stations in 2014 and 2015 are the water level observations minus the tidal levels while at other sites or in 2016 are the h2c simulated water levels minus the tidal levels 3 integrating the outputs of h2c with lstm gpc precipitation fews pet and upstream discharge observations from 2009 to 2015 serve as inputs to train the lstm model then upstream discharge is computed by h2c gpc precipitation and fews pet in 2016 are adopted in the trained lstm model to predict the upstream discharge at makou station to account for stochasticity 9 simulation trials with different random seeds are conducted after transmitting the series to lstm and the performance is reported based on the average of the 9 predictions after optimizing the hyperparameter values of lstm in upstream discharge predictions are determined epochs 450 time step 90 h batch size 1200 hidden layer 2 learning rate 0 001 and the loss function is mean squared error with the final testing loss of less than 0 005 the h2c simulated upstream discharge surges tidal levels and water level observations label sequences for lstm in 2014 and 2015 at jiangmen and zhuyin stations serve as the training set in the lstm model then the h2c simulated upstream discharge surges and tidal levels at the other cells are adopted in the trained lstm model to predict water levels in 2014 and 2015 and the water level observations at daao station are used for validation in the testing period the h2c simulated upstream discharge surges and tidal levels in 2016 at all cells are adopted in the trained lstm model to predict water levels in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the water level observations at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations are used to assess the model 9 simulation trials are also conducted after transmitting the series to lstm the hyperparameter values of lstm in water level predictions are determined epochs 750 time step 45 h batch size 1200 hidden layer 2 learning rate 0 001 and the loss function is mean squared error with the final testing loss of less than 0 0035 4 calculating the relative contributions by xgboost the relative contributions of upstream discharge in 2014 and 2015 are quantified according to the values in each decision tree using xgboost the feature importance of xgboost used in this study is computed by averaging feature s contributions in each tree chen et al 2015 in this process h2c simulated upstream discharge surges and tidal levels at 632 cells in 2014 and 2015 are input to xgboost respectively while the simulated water levels by h2c are the label sequences the hyperparameters of xgboost in each simulation are calibrated through the grid search method with r2 as the optimal target value lerman 1980 the relative contributions of the upstream discharge surge and tidal level to water levels during the simulation periods can therefore be obtained the relative contribution ranges from 0 to 1 in each cell 2 5 comparison model design a hydrologic lstm hydrodynamic coupling model hlhc is developed the predicted upstream discharge of the hydrologic lstm model is input into the hydrodynamic model to predict water levels a hydrologic hydrodynamic lstm model hhlc is developed in which the upstream discharge is simulated by the hydrological model and the water levels are predicted by the hydrodynamic lstm model the simulations using the h2c hlhc and hhlc individually are compared with the proposed model h2c xl moreover the division of training and testing sets in hlhc and hhlc are consistent with h2c xl 2 6 evaluation metrics nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 are used to assess model performance nse characterizes the variance between observations and simulations moriasi et al 2007 rated nse 0 75 as great 0 75 nse 0 65 as good 0 65 nse 0 50 as satisfactory and 0 50 nse as unsatisfactory the kge results can be grouped into poor performance 0 5 kge 0 intermediate 0 75 kge 0 5 and good performance kge 0 75 rogelis et al 2016 3 results 3 1 verification of the predicted upstream discharge the daily upstream discharges of 2016 are predicted by h2c xl fig 3 the nse and kge values in the whole period are 0 886 0 922 and 0 752 0 779 in the flood period respectively table 1 the categories of nse and kge values of simulated upstream discharge are both at great levels and therefore the simulated upstream discharge series are reasonable 3 2 performance of the h2c xl model water level observations recorded by daao station in 2014 and 2015 are used to validate the h2c xl model fig 4 since the storm surge is not studied in this research the events of 2014 9 15 9 16 and 2015 10 3 10 4 were not included in the whole simulation period the nse values in 2014 and 2015 are higher than 0 85 and the kge values are 0 863 and 0 805 respectively table 2 in the flood period the nse values are 0 778 and 0 735 in 2014 and 2015 as the kge values are 0 768 and 0 798 respectively the h2c xl model achieves great performances in nse and kge values at the validation site then the performances of the water level prediction in 2016 using the same model are evaluated fig 5 fig 6 in the whole simulation period the nse is higher than 0 78 and the kge values are higher than 0 8 which are all at great levels at the selected three stations table 2 the simulation results during the flood period indicated a slight decrease in performance compared to the whole simulation period but the nse and kge values are at least at satisfactory levels the h2c xl model somewhat underestimates water level most of the time in the flood case between 2016 6 13 2016 6 22 as listed in table 3 compared with h2c hlhc and hhlc models the nse values of h2c xl are highest at the selected stations and increased by 1 80 40 46 in the whole simulation period and 4 1 116 27 during the flood period respectively in general after integrating water level and upstream discharge observations by machine learning models the estimation accuracy is better than those of h2c especially h2c xl and hlhc the simulation results are better than hhlc and h2c in evaluation indices h2c xl and hlhc could predict upstream discharge accurately after integrating river discharge observations which is crucial for water level simulations in tidal reaches 3 3 relative contributions of upstream discharges in water level predictions the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are calculated through xgboost at 632 sampling sites in 2014 and 2015 for 1264 times after calibrating the parameters the optimal r2 values of simulation results at all sites are above 0 76 and the r2 values of 1261 simulation results are higher than 0 9 fig 7 the relative contributions of upstream discharges vary in 2014 and 2015 fig 8 the values of the relative contributions range from 0 37 to 0 51 in 2014 and from 0 39 to 0 55 in 2015 over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the relative contributions of upstream discharge exceed 0 35 indicating that it cannot be ignored when predicting water levels in tidal rivers which also demonstrates the importance of reliable upstream discharge input the relative contributions are generally lower in the locations that are closer to the coastline however the xgboost model fits the best in the places where the sampling sites are close to the coastline with high r2 values 0 96 further there is a nonlinear increase in the relative contributions as the distance from the coastline increases the values also vary in different years for instance in 2015 the values of the relative contributions exceeded 0 52 in the middle of tianhe zhuyin tidal reach significantly higher than the upper area 4 discussion 4 1 significance of accurate upstream discharge for predicting water level to predict the flood hazard scenarios indicated by water level distribution in an estuary during a relatively short period the average discharge is usually adopted as the upstream boundary in the hydrodynamic model when the influence of storm surge is far greater than upstream discharges on water level employing average discharge can save computing power and exert little impact on the final results nordio and fagherazzi 2022 ralston 2022 however this would cause huge uncertainties if only the mean discharge is set as the upstream boundary in long term water level simulations to further investigate the importance of accurate estimation of upstream discharges using a reliable hydrological model the water levels in 2016 are simulated using the average discharge in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the performances are at unsatisfactory levels at jiangmen station in the nse and kge values table 4 the simulation results at daao station are better than jiangmen station while the nse values are still at unsatisfactory levels only at zhuyin station where the impact of upstream discharge on water levels is relatively weak the simulation results are at satisfactory levels even the kge value reaches 0 8 in 2015 in general the relative contributions of river discharge are higher in the upper reaches and decrease seaward under the combined effects of tides which is consistent with the previous study cao et al 2020 however the relative contributions of upstream discharge are higher in the middle over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach even higher than the upper parts in 2015 fig 8 the friction term is the main reason for nonlinearity jay et al 2011 the friction significantly changes due to the enlarging cross sections and bifurcations of the river and the increase in frictional resistance suppresses the propagation of tidal waves in addition the relative contributions of upstream discharge vary each year in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the flood period is longer and the average flood discharge is greater in 2015 17 days 7700 10 m3 s than in 2014 13 days 6405 31 m3 s the relative contributions of upstream discharge at 519 sites in 2015 are higher than in 2014 among the 632 sampling points and the closer to the coastline the larger the difference values of relative contributions fig 9 moreover the nonlinearity is obvious when the upstream discharge is large the larger upstream discharge causes more significant friction damping which shows more obvious inhibitory effects on tides in downstream sections than small upstream discharge leading to larger difference values in relative contributions 4 2 advantages and limitations of physics guide machine learning approaches physics guide machine learning models would take full advantage of the meteorologic hydrological and topographic data such as dem precipitation potential evapotranspiration and astronomical tide level to provide useful training information for machine learning as the proposed h2c xl in this paper the excellent capabilities enable the physics guide machine learning models to guide more effective water level simulation and prediction at the same time the physics guide machine learning models are also applicable to other estuaries globally feng et al 2022 zahura et al 2020 however some misleading physical characteristics generated by physical models will also be involved in the machine learning models féret et al 2019 karniadakis et al 2021 the predictive errors could be greatly reduced by learning high quality observations a more effective physical model would be required if the available data is limited in this study the corresponding deviations will lead to the same trends in h2c xl due to uncertainty propagation from the h2c model for example the water level predictions using h2c xl are similar with those using h2c as both methods underestimate water levels at jiangmen station while overestimate water levels at daao and zhuyin stations from 2016 6 13 to 2016 6 22 a flood event fig 10 although the prediction bias of the h2c has been reduced by learning the features of the observations the trend of the mean absolute bias of the results from h2c xl and h2c is also similar in the whole simulation period to be specific the average bias of h2c xl is only 0 16 m 0 17 m 0 15 m and reduced by 23 14 36 46 24 71 compared with h2c at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations respectively in a tidal reach where the upstream discharges play a dominant role the highest water level occurs in the upstream area when the impact of storm surge is not counted in while the lowest water level is supposed to occur in the downstream area dykstra et al 2022 in general machine learning prediction results should not exceed the range of label sequences graves et al 2006 therefore the water level observations at jiangmen and zhuyin stations are selected as label sequences in this study and the prediction results are at great levels with nse values table 3 two other experiments are carried out in experiment 1 water level observations at zhuyin and daao stations in 2014 and 2015 are set as label sequences in experiment 2 water level observations at jiangmen and daao stations are set as label sequences the prediction results of experiment 1 and experiment 2 are validated at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations in 2016 table 5 the prediction results at jiangmen station in experiment 1 are worse in the nse and kge values than experiment 2 the water levels at jiangmen station are higher than at daao and zhuyin stations due to the limitations of machine learning models large uncertainties are involved in the prediction results beyond the training range similar results are also indicated by previous studies elmes et al 2020 zhang 2019 the nse values of the prediction results in experiment 2 are comparable to the prediction results by setting water level observations at jiangmen and zhuyin stations as label sequences in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the low water levels at each site are similar so water level observations at daao or zhuyin station can be used as label sequences with negligible differences meanwhile the water level observations of at least one upstream station should be chosen as label sequences to ensure prediction precision giventhe above large bias might still be generated by the newly proposed hybrid model if unprecedented extreme values of upstream discharge and water level cannot be predicted accurately by the physics guided model due to the structural feature of the machine learning methods if there is an extreme value beyond the preset range the credibility of the predictions will decrease in addition within the framework of the new hybrid model only physics guided model moves data unidirectionally to machine learning models while future work should be conducted to improve the physics guided model and optimize the parameters based on the results yielded from the machine learning methods 5 conclusion in this study the h2c model is developed and the outputs are integrated with lstm to predict water levels tianhe zhuyin tidal reach is selected and the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated by accumulative observations the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are assessed by the xgboost model the nse value of predicted upstream discharge is 0 866 in the whole simulation period and 0 752 during the flood period as for water level predictions the nse values are at least 0 781 in the whole simulation period and 0 598 during the flood period the h2c xl model outperforms the other three reference models the nse values are all at great levels in the whole simulation period and increased by 1 80 71 27 compared with the other three reference models the nse values of h2c xl are at least at satisfactory levels and increased by 4 1 116 27 during the flood periods the performance of h2c xl is slightly improved than hlhc but greatly improved compared with hhlc and h2c in evaluation indices especially at jiangmen and daao stations h2c xl and hlhc could provide more accurate upstream discharge by learning the upstream discharge observations at makou station which is crucial to predict water level processes accurately in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are assessed in 632 cells over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the relative contributions of upstream discharge vary at the same site in different years which is determined by the hydrological conditions the values of the relative contributions range from 0 37 to 0 51 in 2014 and from 0 39 to 0 55 in 2015 moreover the values of relative contributions are relatively low near the coastline but nonlinearly increase with the distance from the coastline credit authorship contribution statement kai fei conceptualization methodology data curation formal

jiangmen and daao stations which are improved by 12 34 40 46 and 16 98 32 34 than those of above models the relative contribution of upstream discharge to water level predictions in tianhe zhuyin reach ranges from 0 37 to 0 55 the values vary at the same site depending on the hydrologic conditions each year and are relatively low near the coastline but nonlinearly increase with the distance from the coastline keywords water level prediction tidal reach hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling model machine learning upstream discharge relative contribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction along with global warming speeding up the pace and extreme weather occurring with increasing frequency and intensity the occurrences of flood disasters in tidal riparian regions have dramatically increased talke and jay 2020 therefore accurate water level predictions of the tidal rivers are crucial in implementing flood control measures and reducing flood losses de dominicis et al 2020 yin et al 2018 the water level of tidal rivers is influenced by both the gravity from sun and moon with a certain periodicity and the upstream discharge the tidal signal is strongly nonstationary due to the combined effects of upstream discharge and tides making it challenging to estimate water levels accurately in tidal reaches cao et al 2020 to interpret the spatiotemporal changes in estuarine water level requires long term measurements and it is hard to achieve a high degree of prediction accuracy guo et al 2015 hydrodynamic models based on the navier stokes equations can simulate the water level processes which have achieved remarkable progress medeiros and hagen 2013 woodruff et al 2013 however to simulate the relatively long term hydrodynamic processes in a large watershed covering both the upstream region and offshore areas using a hydrodynamic model alone is quite time consuming furthermore relying solely on the hydrodynamic modeling and parameter adjusting cannot fully consider hydrological factors for instance if the river discharge from the upper basin is ignored by the hydrodynamic model the predicted water levels in tidal rivers would be underestimated especially during the flood period peng et al 2018 the distributed hydrological model is a good alternative in providing upstream discharge for hydrodynamic models which can predict streamflow on a large scale by adopting satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets luo and zuo 2019 sood and smakhtin 2015 gao et al 2023 considering the importance of upstream discharge for water level prediction in tidal rivers and the wide applicability of hydrological models coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models are necessary to investigate water level processes in tidal rivers nevertheless uncertain boundary conditions model parameterization and structural errors of the coupling model would negatively impact the accuracy of water level simulations alizadeh et al 2021 these model inaccuracies can then contribute to unsatisfactory performance in long term forecasting machine learning methods have been widely used in many fields over recent years feng et al 2020 jin et al 2020 wang et al 2021 for example the long short term memory lstm model can be used to solve the problems of gradient disappearance and explosion in the long term training of recurrent neural network hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 machine learning models can also offer feature importance and non linear relationships such as extreme gradient boosting xgboost however machine learning methods have the limitations that abundant training data in situ are required and they could neither depict the real physical processes reichstein et al 2019 nor represent the out of sample situations accurately sun et al 2021 by integrating the machine learning methods with the physics guided hydrological and hydrodynamic models the limitations of both methods can be reduced the simulation results from the hydrological and hydrodynamic models can provide useful information and input for machine learning algorithms physics guided models are independent of high quality observations and they would provide unprecedented extreme values for machine learning models hence the regional characteristics of the study area can be considered and the generalization capabilities of machine learning methods could be improved guo et al 2022 yaseen et al 2018 by introducing machine learning technology the accuracy of long term predictions from the physics guided models could be enhanced huang et al 2022 zounemat kermani et al 2021 for instance karpatne et al 2017 proposed a physics guided machine learning method which could incorporate the architecture s applicable physical principles into hydrological processes cho and kim 2022 combined weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system and lstm to predict the inflow of soyangho lake konapala et al 2020 developed a hybrid model to simulate streamflow in catchments across the conterminous united states by combining the sacramento soil moisture accounting model and lstm the previous studies showed considerable improvements in the nash sutcliffe efficiency value by combining the machine learning methods with the physics guided models however previous studies mainly focused on streamflow predictions without considering the tidal effects furthermore long term water level predictions based on the physics guided machine learning models in tidal reaches are rarely reported the relative contributions of upstream discharge on water levels in a tidal reach are significant in estuarine areas especially when the upstream discharge is huge jay and flinchem 1997 leonardi et al 2015 the hydrological processes and their spatiotemporal variations in a tidal river could be better investigated by analyzing the relative contributions of upstream discharge cao et al 2020 besides assessing the relative contributions of upstream discharge is instrumental in analyzing the residual water level caused by the strong tide river interaction as there are positive correlations between the two hoitink and jay 2016 therefore as an input feature for predicting the water levels of tidal rivers the relative contribution of upstream discharge needs to be quantified and the affected areas should also be explored by far most studies focused on a single disaster event during a relatively short period using traditional methods for simulating water levels familkhalili et al 2020 gori et al 2020 the studies on long term water level predictions in tidal reaches using the ensemble of the hydrological hydrodynamic coupling model and the machine learning model are limited insufficient research has been carried out on assessing the relative contributions of upstream discharges to water levels as mentioned above a riverine estuary hydrologic and hydrodynamic coupling model h2c is first developed with an emphasis on predicting long term upstream discharge and water level processes in tidal rivers then the outputs of h2c are integrated with lstm and xgboost h2c xl to improve the water level predictions this h2c model is driven by basin scale satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets and tpxo9 tidal data which fully accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological factors of the computing domain and the non linear interactions between upstream discharge and astronomical tides in tidal rivers in particular to which extent the accuracy of water level prediction could be enhanced by integrating the outputs of h2c into machine learning models is estimated which has received little attention in the past relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are quantified by assessing the feature importance using xgboost over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area materials and methods for water level predictions in a selected tidal reach are described in section 3 the predicted water levels by h2c xl are validated based on historical measurement and the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are assessed section 4 discusses the significance of accurate upstream discharge for predicting water level and the advantages and limitations of physics guide machine learning approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and datasets in this study tianhe zhuyin tidal reach which is located in xijiang river basin is selected as the study area with a total length of about 83 km fig 1 the reach has a tropical monsoon climate which is characterized by large river discharge from april to september based on the statistical data of the upstream hydrological station makou hydrological station from 1965 to 2016 according to the report of pearl river water resources commission the average runoff discharges into south china sea through tianhe zhuyin tidal reach are 10810 m3 s and the maximum runoff is 29000 m3 s besides tianhe zhuyin tidal reach is located in the pearl river delta the most economically developed region in china 22 34 22 76 n 113 08 113

station from 2009 1 1 to 2016 12 31 the selected periods of tidal cycles in 2014 2015 and 2016 are the same the underwater bathymetry data of tianhe zhuyin tidal reach was measured in 1999 the

evapotranspiration data from famine early warning systems network fews pet both pet and precipitation datasets are the daily estimates the digital elevation model dem of the xijiang river basin is obtained from hydrosheds lehner and grill 2013 time series of tidal level tpxo9 tidal data extracted from texas potsdam nasa 9 tide model data release is used to specify the open boundaries egbert and erofeeva 2018 the flood events are selected according to the china annual water regime report 2 2 riverine estuary hydrological and hydrodynamic coupling model in this study a riverine estuary hydrologic and hydrodynamic coupling model h2c is developed the model engine consists of two components the hydrological model wang et al 2011 that computes excess rainfall and river discharges and a 2d hydrodynamic model du et al 2023 that simulates water level processes by setting the simulated river discharge as the upstream boundary the details of hydrological and hydrodynamic models are shown in the support information text s1 s2 2 3 machine learning models the recurrent neural network rnn is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes can create a cycle lstm is a special rnn algorithm it adds an input gate forgetting gate and output gate to each neuron which can solve the problems of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the process of long term sequence training making full use of the relationship among long term sequences greff et al 2017 the details of lstm are shown in the support information text s3 xgboost is the ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into strong learners in a single weak learner the relative contribution is calculated by the amount that each attribute split point improves the performance measure weighted by the number of observations the node is responsible for the greater the performance of a feature for the split point improvement the greater the weight finally the results of a feature in all weak learners are weighted and then averaged to get the final relative contribution value chen et al 2015 xgboost provides decision trees logistic regression and svm learners the logistic regression algorithm is used in this study the essence of xgboost is to get a certain kind of mapping relation between features and labels the details of xgboost are shown in the support information text s4 2 4 experimental setup the target tianhe zhuyin tidal reach is discretized into a grid with a resolution of 0 0025 0 0025 with 632 cells the h2c xl model is developed by integrating the outputs of h2c with lstm and xgboost the workflow of h2c xl is shown in fig 2 h2c is driven by satellite derived meteorology estimate datasets and tpxo9 tidal data the data provided to lstm and xgboost models are normalized by the min max normalization method 1 predicting upstream discharge by h2c the location of makou station is set to be the upstream boundary for water level simulations the daily upstream discharge is simulated by h2c the calibration period is 2009 1 1 2013 12 31 the infiltration parameters include the exponent of the variable infiltration curve and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity which are based on a priori parameters vergara et al 2016 gao et al 2016 the parameters including maximum soil water capacity impervious area ratio conversion factor from potential evapotranspiration to actual evapotranspiration and initial value of soil water are calibrated by differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm vrugt et al 2009 the optimized parameter values are obtained by maximizing the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient then 2014 and 2015 are selected as the validation period and the upstream discharge in 2016 is predicted by h2c 2 predicting water levels by h2c the water levels in 632 cells can be simulated using h2c the simulation period is from 2014 to 2016 the river discharge observations in 2014 and 2015 and improved upstream discharge in 2016 are inputs for the upstream boundary of the hydrodynamic model the manning s n coefficient is manually calibrated based on yang et al 2019 and garzon and ferreira 2016 the target is to make nse values exceeding 0 75 at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations the tidal levels in each cell can be simulated by setting the upstream discharge to 0 the simulated tidal levels are validated by water level observations at dahengqin station where the water level is not affected by upstream discharges the upstream discharge surges at jiangmen and zhuyin hydrological stations in 2014 and 2015 are the water level observations minus the tidal levels while at other sites or in 2016 are the h2c simulated water levels minus the tidal levels 3 integrating the outputs of h2c with lstm gpc precipitation fews pet and upstream discharge observations from 2009 to 2015 serve as inputs to train the lstm model then upstream discharge is computed by h2c gpc precipitation and fews pet in 2016 are adopted in the trained lstm model to predict the upstream discharge at makou station to account for stochasticity 9 simulation trials with different random seeds are conducted after transmitting the series to lstm and the performance is reported based on the average of the 9 predictions after optimizing the hyperparameter values of lstm in upstream discharge predictions are determined epochs 450 time step 90 h batch size 1200 hidden layer 2 learning rate 0 001 and the loss function is mean squared error with the final testing loss of less than 0 005 the h2c simulated upstream discharge surges tidal levels and water level observations label sequences for lstm in 2014 and 2015 at jiangmen and zhuyin stations serve as the training set in the lstm model then the h2c simulated upstream discharge surges and tidal levels at the other cells are adopted in the trained lstm model to predict water levels in 2014 and 2015 and the water level observations at daao station are used for validation in the testing period the h2c simulated upstream discharge surges and tidal levels in 2016 at all cells are adopted in the trained lstm model to predict water levels in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the water level observations at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations are used to assess the model 9 simulation trials are also conducted after transmitting the series to lstm the hyperparameter values of lstm in water level predictions are determined epochs 750 time step 45 h batch size 1200 hidden layer 2 learning rate 0 001 and the loss function is mean squared error with the final testing loss of less than 0 0035 4 calculating the relative contributions by xgboost the relative contributions of upstream discharge in 2014 and 2015 are quantified according to the values in each decision tree using xgboost the feature importance of xgboost used in this study is computed by averaging feature s contributions in each tree chen et al 2015 in this process h2c simulated upstream discharge surges and tidal levels at 632 cells in 2014 and 2015 are input to xgboost respectively while the simulated water levels by h2c are the label sequences the hyperparameters of xgboost in each simulation are calibrated through the grid search method with r2 as the optimal target value lerman 1980 the relative contributions of the upstream discharge surge and tidal level to water levels during the simulation periods can therefore be obtained the relative contribution ranges from 0 to 1 in each cell 2 5 comparison model design a hydrologic lstm hydrodynamic coupling model hlhc is developed the predicted upstream discharge of the hydrologic lstm model is input into the hydrodynamic model to predict water levels a hydrologic hydrodynamic lstm model hhlc is developed in which the upstream discharge is simulated by the hydrological model and the water levels are predicted by the hydrodynamic lstm model the simulations using the h2c hlhc and hhlc individually are compared with the proposed model h2c xl moreover the division of training and testing sets in hlhc and hhlc are consistent with h2c xl 2 6 evaluation metrics nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 are used to assess model performance nse characterizes the variance between observations and simulations moriasi et al 2007 rated nse 0 75 as great 0 75 nse 0 65 as good 0 65 nse 0 50 as satisfactory and 0 50 nse as unsatisfactory the kge results can be grouped into poor performance 0 5 kge 0 intermediate 0 75 kge 0 5 and good performance kge 0 75 rogelis et al 2016 3 results 3 1 verification of the predicted upstream discharge the daily upstream discharges of 2016 are predicted by h2c xl fig 3 the nse and kge values in the whole period are 0 886 0 922 and 0 752 0 779 in the flood period respectively table 1 the categories of nse and kge values of simulated upstream discharge are both at great levels and therefore the simulated upstream discharge series are reasonable 3 2 performance of the h2c xl model water level observations recorded by daao station in 2014 and 2015 are used to validate the h2c xl model fig 4 since the storm surge is not studied in this research the events of 2014 9 15 9 16 and 2015 10 3 10 4 were not included in the whole simulation period the nse values in 2014 and 2015 are higher than 0 85 and the kge values are 0 863 and 0 805 respectively table 2 in the flood period the nse values are 0 778 and 0 735 in 2014 and 2015 as the kge values are 0 768 and 0 798 respectively the h2c xl model achieves great performances in nse and kge values at the validation site then the performances of the water level prediction in 2016 using the same model are evaluated fig 5 fig 6 in the whole simulation period the nse is higher than 0 78 and the kge values are higher than 0 8 which are all at great levels at the selected three stations table 2 the simulation results during the flood period indicated a slight decrease in performance compared to the whole simulation period but the nse and kge values are at least at satisfactory levels the h2c xl model somewhat underestimates water level most of the time in the flood case between 2016 6 13 2016 6 22 as listed in table 3 compared with h2c hlhc and hhlc models the nse values of h2c xl are highest at the selected stations and increased by 1 80 40 46 in the whole simulation period and 4 1 116 27 during the flood period respectively in general after integrating water level and upstream discharge observations by machine learning models the estimation accuracy is better than those of h2c especially h2c xl and hlhc the simulation results are better than hhlc and h2c in evaluation indices h2c xl and hlhc could predict upstream discharge accurately after integrating river discharge observations which is crucial for water level simulations in tidal reaches 3 3 relative contributions of upstream discharges in water level predictions the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are calculated through xgboost at 632 sampling sites in 2014 and 2015 for 1264 times after calibrating the parameters the optimal r2 values of simulation results at all sites are above 0 76 and the r2 values of 1261 simulation results are higher than 0 9 fig 7 the relative contributions of upstream discharges vary in 2014 and 2015 fig 8 the values of the relative contributions range from 0 37 to 0 51 in 2014 and from 0 39 to 0 55 in 2015 over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the relative contributions of upstream discharge exceed 0 35 indicating that it cannot be ignored when predicting water levels in tidal rivers which also demonstrates the importance of reliable upstream discharge input the relative contributions are generally lower in the locations that are closer to the coastline however the xgboost model fits the best in the places where the sampling sites are close to the coastline with high r2 values 0 96 further there is a nonlinear increase in the relative contributions as the distance from the coastline increases the values also vary in different years for instance in 2015 the values of the relative contributions exceeded 0 52 in the middle of tianhe zhuyin tidal reach significantly higher than the upper area 4 discussion 4 1 significance of accurate upstream discharge for predicting water level to predict the flood hazard scenarios indicated by water level distribution in an estuary during a relatively short period the average discharge is usually adopted as the upstream boundary in the hydrodynamic model when the influence of storm surge is far greater than upstream discharges on water level employing average discharge can save computing power and exert little impact on the final results nordio and fagherazzi 2022 ralston 2022 however this would cause huge uncertainties if only the mean discharge is set as the upstream boundary in long term water level simulations to further investigate the importance of accurate estimation of upstream discharges using a reliable hydrological model the water levels in 2016 are simulated using the average discharge in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the performances are at unsatisfactory levels at jiangmen station in the nse and kge values table 4 the simulation results at daao station are better than jiangmen station while the nse values are still at unsatisfactory levels only at zhuyin station where the impact of upstream discharge on water levels is relatively weak the simulation results are at satisfactory levels even the kge value reaches 0 8 in 2015 in general the relative contributions of river discharge are higher in the upper reaches and decrease seaward under the combined effects of tides which is consistent with the previous study cao et al 2020 however the relative contributions of upstream discharge are higher in the middle over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach even higher than the upper parts in 2015 fig 8 the friction term is the main reason for nonlinearity jay et al 2011 the friction significantly changes due to the enlarging cross sections and bifurcations of the river and the increase in frictional resistance suppresses the propagation of tidal waves in addition the relative contributions of upstream discharge vary each year in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the flood period is longer and the average flood discharge is greater in 2015 17 days 7700 10 m3 s than in 2014 13 days 6405 31 m3 s the relative contributions of upstream discharge at 519 sites in 2015 are higher than in 2014 among the 632 sampling points and the closer to the coastline the larger the difference values of relative contributions fig 9 moreover the nonlinearity is obvious when the upstream discharge is large the larger upstream discharge causes more significant friction damping which shows more obvious inhibitory effects on tides in downstream sections than small upstream discharge leading to larger difference values in relative contributions 4 2 advantages and limitations of physics guide machine learning approaches physics guide machine learning models would take full advantage of the meteorologic hydrological and topographic data such as dem precipitation potential evapotranspiration and astronomical tide level to provide useful training information for machine learning as the proposed h2c xl in this paper the excellent capabilities enable the physics guide machine learning models to guide more effective water level simulation and prediction at the same time the physics guide machine learning models are also applicable to other estuaries globally feng et al 2022 zahura et al 2020 however some misleading physical characteristics generated by physical models will also be involved in the machine learning models féret et al 2019 karniadakis et al 2021 the predictive errors could be greatly reduced by learning high quality observations a more effective physical model would be required if the available data is limited in this study the corresponding deviations will lead to the same trends in h2c xl due to uncertainty propagation from the h2c model for example the water level predictions using h2c xl are similar with those using h2c as both methods underestimate water levels at jiangmen station while overestimate water levels at daao and zhuyin stations from 2016 6 13 to 2016 6 22 a flood event fig 10 although the prediction bias of the h2c has been reduced by learning the features of the observations the trend of the mean absolute bias of the results from h2c xl and h2c is also similar in the whole simulation period to be specific the average bias of h2c xl is only 0 16 m 0 17 m 0 15 m and reduced by 23 14 36 46 24 71 compared with h2c at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations respectively in a tidal reach where the upstream discharges play a dominant role the highest water level occurs in the upstream area when the impact of storm surge is not counted in while the lowest water level is supposed to occur in the downstream area dykstra et al 2022 in general machine learning prediction results should not exceed the range of label sequences graves et al 2006 therefore the water level observations at jiangmen and zhuyin stations are selected as label sequences in this study and the prediction results are at great levels with nse values table 3 two other experiments are carried out in experiment 1 water level observations at zhuyin and daao stations in 2014 and 2015 are set as label sequences in experiment 2 water level observations at jiangmen and daao stations are set as label sequences the prediction results of experiment 1 and experiment 2 are validated at jiangmen daao and zhuyin stations in 2016 table 5 the prediction results at jiangmen station in experiment 1 are worse in the nse and kge values than experiment 2 the water levels at jiangmen station are higher than at daao and zhuyin stations due to the limitations of machine learning models large uncertainties are involved in the prediction results beyond the training range similar results are also indicated by previous studies elmes et al 2020 zhang 2019 the nse values of the prediction results in experiment 2 are comparable to the prediction results by setting water level observations at jiangmen and zhuyin stations as label sequences in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the low water levels at each site are similar so water level observations at daao or zhuyin station can be used as label sequences with negligible differences meanwhile the water level observations of at least one upstream station should be chosen as label sequences to ensure prediction precision giventhe above large bias might still be generated by the newly proposed hybrid model if unprecedented extreme values of upstream discharge and water level cannot be predicted accurately by the physics guided model due to the structural feature of the machine learning methods if there is an extreme value beyond the preset range the credibility of the predictions will decrease in addition within the framework of the new hybrid model only physics guided model moves data unidirectionally to machine learning models while future work should be conducted to improve the physics guided model and optimize the parameters based on the results yielded from the machine learning methods 5 conclusion in this study the h2c model is developed and the outputs are integrated with lstm to predict water levels tianhe zhuyin tidal reach is selected and the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated by accumulative observations the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are assessed by the xgboost model the nse value of predicted upstream discharge is 0 866 in the whole simulation period and 0 752 during the flood period as for water level predictions the nse values are at least 0 781 in the whole simulation period and 0 598 during the flood period the h2c xl model outperforms the other three reference models the nse values are all at great levels in the whole simulation period and increased by 1 80 71 27 compared with the other three reference models the nse values of h2c xl are at least at satisfactory levels and increased by 4 1 116 27 during the flood periods the performance of h2c xl is slightly improved than hlhc but greatly improved compared with hhlc and h2c in evaluation indices especially at jiangmen and daao stations h2c xl and hlhc could provide more accurate upstream discharge by learning the upstream discharge observations at makou station which is crucial to predict water level processes accurately in tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the relative contributions of upstream discharge to water level predictions are assessed in 632 cells over tianhe zhuyin tidal reach the relative contributions of upstream discharge vary at the same site in different years which is determined by the hydrological conditions the values of the relative contributions range from 0 37 to 0 51 in 2014 and from 0 39 to 0 55 in 2015 moreover the values of relative contributions are relatively low near the coastline but nonlinearly increase with the distance from the coastline credit authorship contribution statement kai fei conceptualization methodology data curation formal

1791,the faidherbia tree faidherbia albida is frequently used as an intercrop in sahelian agroforestry parklands due to its multi purpose advantages and reverse phenology however its effect upon the water balance remains unclear due to the challenges in directly measuring water fluxes in the underlying vadose zone mechanistic hydrological models can be inversely calibrated on transient observations and used to partition different hydrological components but the computational burden of the analysis can become impractical if the model itself is computationally expensive to overcome this limitation and to provide novel insights into the hydrological role of faidherbia we combine a low fidelity one dimensional hydrological model hydrus 1d with a kriging based correction function to emulate the response of a high fidelity two dimensional axisymmetric description of the system hydrus 2d multiannual measurements of soil moisture and sap flow in a senegal agroforestry parkland are used in conjunction with bayesian inference to calibrate the resulting validated multifidelity surrogate and to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters results show that the model can reproduce observations with good accuracy and limited uncertainty for both the calibration and the validation phases and also confirm the phreatophytic behaviour of faidherbia by indicating the existence of a moderately compensated root water uptake moreover a local sensitivity analysis suggests that a fully compensated uptake could potentially reduce groundwater recharge by 13 interestingly estimated soil hydraulic parameters hint at the possibility of root induced changes in soil hydraulic properties that mimic preferential and or macropore flow resulting in sustained recharge fluxes 26 of the annual precipitation the analysis indicates that overall faidherbia could have a net positive effect upon the water balance in arid areas keywords arid areas hydrus surrogate

precipitation kuriqi et al 2019 in sub saharan africa ssa arid regions are predicted to expand due to climate change feng fu 2013 the resulting combination of high temperatures extremely variable

parklands large intercropped trees is detrimental to that balance but other studies show that the trees roots increase groundwater recharge by altering soil hydraulic properties bargués tobella et al 2014 ilstedt et al 2016 the intercropped tree species faidherbia albida del a chev syn acacia albida del is investigated extensively in the agricultural and ecological literature barnes fagg 2003 its uncommon reverse phenology shedding all of its leaves at the beginning of the rainy season wickens 1969 benefits the major crops by providing a significant nitrogen input to the topsoil at the growing season a further benefit for the major crops is that the leafless tree canopies intercept less light and rainfall rhoades 1995 because of these benefits much effort has been devoted to understanding the faidherbia effect upon ecosystem services and crops louppe et al 1996 tschakert et al 2004 roupsard et al 2020 leroux et al 2020 faye et al 2021 t lu et al 2022 dierks et al 2022 to understand how faidherbia s sustains its peculiar reverse phenology in an arid region roupsard et al 1999 studied the species sap flows and water potentials and the isotopic compositions of relevant water fractions the results showed that faidherbia obtains most of its water from the groundwater thus enabling this species to grow during the dry season with little indication of drought stress however faidherbia s hydrological impact remains poorly understood despite all of this scientific effort the main difficulty lies in measuring water fluxes in the vadose zone beneath the trees these fluxes can be inferred from other measurements but the results frequently fail to tie together all components of the hydrological balance coherently an additional challenge to understanding these fluxes is the multidimensional morphological complexity of the tree roots spatial distribution a comprehensive theoretical framework for reproducing that complexity is offered by mechanistic vadose zone hydrological models such as hydrus or swap van dam et al 2008 šimůnek et al 2016 these models can discriminate the different water balance components but to do so the models must describe the system s hydrologic functioning satisfactorily satisfactory descriptions can be generally achieved by combining data from multiple transient observations e g transpiration rates and volumetric water content with specific numerical techniques e g bayesian inference and optimization strategies to calibrate and validate the model and therefore to assess its predictive uncertainty brunetti et al 2019a vrugt et al 2008 wöhling and vrugt 2011 once the model is calibrated it can be used to probabilistically separate all hydrological components e g recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes and to discern the effects of physical factors such as roots and soil at present this type of approach presents multiple general and case specific challenges one of these challenges is that the calibration procedure requires thousands of model executions in order to assess the models uncertainties the computational burden of that assessment can easily become prohibitive if the model itself is computationally expensive modelling of fluxes in the soil tree domain is especially susceptible to this problem because the above mentioned morphological complexity of root systems requires a numerical model that is at least 2d axisymmetric i e that has cylindrical symmetry see for example deb et al 2013 supercomputers or distributed computing clusters might be able to handle the job but are not widely available an appealing alternative is to reduce the computational workload by using surrogate based models in place of the complex original high fidelity model razavi et al 2012 when used for calibration purposes surrogate modelling frequently aims to build an emulator that can calculate the objective function or the likelihood for different input parameters as if the function were being computed using the original high fidelity model e g a 2d axisymmetric one because the emulator can do the calculations in much less time the calibration procedure is made feasible brunetti et al 2017 a diversity of water related studies have used so called response surface surrogates successfully including kriging radial basis functions and polynomial chaos expansion asher et al 2015 keating et al 2010 laloy et al 2013 razavi et al 2012 zeng et al 2018 x zhang et al 2009 however when the dimensionality of the inverse problem is moderately high e g 10 the necessary training of these surrogates requires an impractically high number of executions of the high fidelity model in order to achieve a good coverage of the parameters space o hagan 2006 a possible remedy is to use low fidelity physically based surrogates which are essentially cheaper to run approximations of the original complex models for example the surrogate model can be 1d instead of 2d razavi et al 2012 when the surrogate uses the same theoretical framework and parameters as the high fidelity model the discrepancy between their respective response surfaces is expected to be limited this discrepancy can be corrected by using an appropriate function that relates the responses of the low and high fidelity models the so called multifidelity approach develops the necessary correction function by using response surface surrogates which is generally easier to reconstruct because the low fidelity response surface is supposedly a good approximation to the high fidelity one by thus reducing computational cost while mimicking the output of a high fidelity forward model simulation multifidelity surrogate analysis makes itself highly attractive for calibrating vadose zone hydrological models few studies to date have calibrated vadose zone hydrological models via this approach man et al 2018 2021 zheng et al 2019 therefore the present study uses it to efficiently calibrate and validate a high fidelity two dimensional axisymmetric hydrus model of the vadose zone underlying a faidherbia tree in an agroforestry parkland in senegal the data used in the validation are from multiannual comprehensive measurements of sap flows and of volumetric water contents at different depths the validated multifidelity surrogate merges hydrus 1d and a kriging based correction function to emulate the response of hydrus 2d the surrogate is coupled with a monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithm to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters and to assess the model s predictive uncertainty parameters that were estimated via the surrogate are then transferred into the high fidelity hydrus 2d model for validation purposes then the validated hydrus 2d model is used to discriminate the different water fluxes explain their interrelations and assess their effects upon the hydrological balance the realistic application of a multifidelity surrogate based approach to calibrate a hydrological model of the vadose zone is a novel contribution in this field the results can be valuable for a better understanding of water balances in agroforestry parklands in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description and data analysis the study area is part of the faidherbia flux fluxnet sn nkr collaborative platform https lped info wikiobssn faidherbia flux located in the agroforestry parkland of sob village 135 km from dakar within the senegal groundnut basin roupsard et al 2020 soils are predominantly sandy of a type known locally as

continental terminal ct formation oligo miocene to pliocene with a shallow brackish water 4 5 6 0 m below the ground surface this aquifer overlies an impervious eocene marl limestone bedrock at a depth of around 40 m the data that the authors used to design this research work and to validate the resulting model were collected during an intensive three year field experiment from 2019 to 2021 meteorological data were provided by an automatic station cr1000 campbell sci equipped with classical automatic sensors that made measurements every 30 sec and averaged them to every 30 min measured parameters included rainfall events te25mm air temperature and relative humidity at 2 m above the ground cs215 and wind speed at 4 5 m above ground level wind master sonic anemometer gill instruments lymington uk wind speeds at 2 m were then estimated et0 was computed according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen 1998 to estimate the amount of water used by faidherbia trees we neglected water storage and assumed that the water use was equal to the transpiration which was estimated from sap flows these flows had been measured during 2019 2021 via the single probe transient thermal dissipation method do et al 2011 with a cyclical heating of 600 sec every 30 min the total sap flow lt 1 was calculated for each tree and averaged between trees to yield a mean flow for an average tree of the stand the 2019 2021 experiments also monitored the leaf area indices lais of 15 faidherbia trees including the four whose sap flows were being measured the lais were measured every 10 days using a lai2200 device li cor usa to measure transmittances during 2019 2021 volumetric soil water contents were measured in shaded areas under tree canopies at depths of 20 40 60 80 120 140 160 180 280 and 380 cm these data were recorded using automated time domain reflectometers tdr type cs655 campbell which were installed horizontally in a well that was dug close to the tree the tdrs installed at a depth 180 z 0 cm were locally calibrated with data on gravimetric water contents and bulk densities the calibration procedure is explained in details in the supplementary material in contrast tdr sensors installed at a depth z 180 cm used the factory calibration curve which leads to an accuracy of 3 levels of the groundwater table were continuously recorded from august of 2019 by using pressure sensors rugged troll 100 coupled with baro troll 100 for barometric compensation in situ usa the sensors were emplaced in a piezometer close to the locations of the above mentioned tdrs missing data were gap filled via cubic interpolation a linear interpolation was used to extrapolate data back to january 2019 based upon dry season recession curves soil profiles were sampled at different depth intervals to analyse for dry bulk density and soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay textural analyses were performed at the institute of soil physics and rural water management university of natural resources and life sciences vienna the sand fractions were determined by sieving silt and clay fractions were determined via sedimentation the analyses revealed that in the 0 100 cm depth interval the texture was loamy sand with an average bulk density of 1 7 g cm 3 the clay percentage was uniform at about 2 2 but the sand percentage decreased from 85 4 at the soil surface to 77 8 at 60 cm in contrast the soil from 100 down to 500 cm had a sandy loam texture contents of clay 2 9 5 5 and silt 29 3 34 7 were higher than in the 0 100 cm layer but the sand content was lower 67 8 59 8 densities of tree root lengths were characterized underneath tree canopies and far from them per for this purpose those authors excavated 1 m square sampling pits to a depth of 1 5 m results showed that about 62 of faidherbia s fine roots were distributed within the deep soil layer 100 150 cm versus 35 in the 30 100 layer depth and only 3 in the upper layer 0 30 cm interestingly root densities in the 50 100 cm depth interval were significantly higher outside of the canopy although no root density data for depths 150 cm were investigated via excavation field observations that were made during installation of tdrs indicate that faidherbia roots extend far into the deep layer and the capillary fringe this agrees with what reported in roupsard et al 1999 because we would use the above described data set i e from all of the 2019 2021 observations to perform a multifidelity surrogate analysis we partitioned that data into three chronological groups one for each phase of the modelling spin up from 01 to 01 2019 to 10 04 2019 calibration 11 04 2019 to 30 06 2020 and validation 01 07 2020 to 31 12 2021 fig 1 2 2 modelling theory 2 2 1 water flow the variably saturated water flow in a 2d axisymmetric domain is described by the following richards equation 1 θ h t 1 r r rk h h r z k h h z 1 s a h where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 h is the pressure head l t is time t r is the radial space coordinate l z is the vertical coordinate l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and sa h is a sink term l3l 3t 1 defined as a volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit of time due to plant water uptake by setting r 0 eq 1 reduces to the one dimensional richards equation soil hydraulic properties are parameterized via the unimodal van genuchten mualem mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 vgm model as follows 2 θ θ s θ r 1 α h n m θ r if h 0 θ s if h 0 3 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 4 k k s θ l 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 i f h 0 k s i f h 0 5 m 1 1 n where θr l3l 3 is the residual soil water content θs l3l 3 is the saturated soil water content ks lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity α l 1 and n are empirical shape parameters l indicates the tortuosity which is frequently assumed equal to 0 5 mualem 1976 and θ is the effective saturation compensated root water uptake and soil water evaporation the reference evapotranspiration demand is partitioned into potential transpiration sp and potential soil water evaporation ep using the measured lai brunetti et al 2019b ritchie 1972 sutanto et al 2012 the following equation converts sp to actual transpiration sa 6 s a h s p 1 s p r s a h x y z d x d y d z r a h x y z b x y z d x d y d z ω where sa h x y z is actual root water uptake l3l 3t 1 a h x y z is a dimensionless water stress response function b x y z is a dimensionless root density distribution function and ω is a dimensionless water stress index eq 6 describes root water uptake for a general three dimensional problem but can be easily particularized for 1d vertical and 2d axisymmetric domains because this study models the hydrological effects of two vegetation species i e faidherbia and groundnut millet their effects are distinguished in the model by first specifying the root density and the potential transpiration rate for each vegetation using the time series of lai and by then using eq 6 to calculate their respective actual root water uptakes their sum of the two uptakes constitutes the actual sink term in eq 1 based upon results from isotope methods roupsard et al 1999 suggested that faidherbia behaves mostly as a phreatophyte but alternatively uses all root compartments along the vadose zone profile to account for this effect the two models incorporate a dimensionless root adaptability factor ωc which modulates the index ω that is presented in eq 6 ωc is a threshold value above which any reduction in root water uptake that occurs in stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by an increased uptake from unstressed parts the range of values for ωc is 0 ωc 1 root water uptake is not compensated when ωc 1 but is fully compensated when ωc 0 for a detailed explanation please see šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the root water stress response a in eq 6 depends upon the soil pressure head h to model this stress we used skaggs et al s 2006b smooth s shaped function 7 a h 1 1 h h 50 p where h 50 is the pressure head value at which the root water uptake is reduced by 50 l and p is a dimensionless empirical shape parameter the a value ranges from 0 to 1 because actual root water uptake depends upon root density the models include a spatially explicit root density function b x y z in eq 6 this function modulates the uptake at each mesh node in the soil domain models and is based on the formulation proposed by vrugt et al 2001 both models neglect the effect of salinity upon root water uptake because no comprehensive measurements from the area of study are available to characterize solute distribution in the soil domain potential soil water evaporation ep is converted to actual evaporation ea as long as the surface is sufficiently moist and the pressure head at the soil surface doesn t exceed the minimum allowed pressure head hcrit l this value hcrit is estimated from the relative humidity and air temperature however to avoid numerical convergence issues when solving the richards equation the models restrict values of hcrit such that the corresponding soil water contents are at least 0 005 higher than the residual water content θr l3l 3 2 3 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 2 3 1 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters the richards equation and the root water uptake equations i e eq 1 and 6 include several parameters that must be defined in the present study we fixed the values of some of these parameters and calibrated the others based upon the volumetric water content and sap flow observations from 2019 to 2021 specifically the residual water content θr is set to 0 for all soil horizons because the soil is mainly sandy brunetti et al 2020 the tortuosity factor l is set to the common value of 0 5 van genuchten 1980 for groundnut millet the root water uptake parameters h 50 and p are set equal to 800 cm and 3 respectively these values provide a good approximation to the piecewise linear feddes function used by diongue et al 2022b to describe the actual root water uptake of groundnut millet by using these assumptions only 15 model parameters needed to be calibrated including the saturated water content θs the vgm shape parameters α and n the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for three soil horizons the root adaptability factor ωc and root water uptake parameters h50 and p 2 3 2 bayesian inference the bayesian inference is used to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters and to therefore assess their uncertainty the definition of a parameters prior distribution and a likelihood function are required to infer the parameters posterior distribution the prior distribution is set to be bounded uniform for all parameters upper and lower bounds table 1 are chosen based on the prior information available regarding the soil textural composition followed by a comprehensive literature review selection of the likelihood functions took into consideration the types of observations that are included in the bayesian framework and the characteristics of each observation s measurement errors to a large degree those observations consisted of soil moisture measurements because the final calibrated model is intended to reproduce the deterministic part of each observed signal the error model for each measurement should approximate the properties of the measurement s remaining stochastic part that part depends upon the measurement device the tdr cs655 that was used to measure soil moisture during the 2019 2021 field study determines the velocity of electromagnetic pulses as they traverse a wave guide that is inserted into the soil the pulses are independent of each other thereby excluding the possibility of autocorrelation in the measurements errors moreover the procedure that was used for calibrating the tdr cs655 in the upper soil layers led to gaussian homoscedastic residuals caldwell et al 2018 with σ 0 015 supplementary material for these reasons we assumed that the error residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with constant variance σ 2 those assumptions lead to the following form for the log likelihood function ℓ u 8 ℓ u k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 1 2 σ 2 i 1 k y i u y i 2 where k is the number of observations yi u and ỹi u are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively it is worth noting that although other forms of the likelihood function e g first order autoregressive wöhling vrugt 2011 might improve the quality of the model s fitting they could also compromise the objectivity of subsequent assessments of the model s adequacy for that reason we opted to use a traditional measurement motivated gaussian likelihood function followed by model predictive checks for both the calibration and validation period to discuss the model adequacy because the calibration procedure includes sap flows and locally and factory calibrated tdr measurements the final log likelihood function l u is the aggregated sum of single log likelihoods for each jth measurements set 9 l u j 1 3 ℓ j u σ are assumed equal to 0 01 cm day for the sap flow 0 015 and 0 03 for the locally i e 180 z 0 cm and factory i e z 180 cm calibrated volumetric water contents respectively having selected the prior distribution and likelihood function for each of the 15 parameters we then used a hybrid monte carlo markov chain mcmc ensemble sampler to estimate the parameters posterior distributions the algorithm combines the differential evolution snooker move developed by ter braak and vrugt 2008 with the affine invariant stretch move proposed by goodman and weare 2010 to improve the algorithm convergence chains were initialized by random sampling from a multivariate normal distribution that is centred upon the global optimum xopt this optimum was identified via the gradient based comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization g clpso that brunetti et al 2022 developed for the hydrus model the main diagnostic for monitoring the convergence of the mcmc sampler was the integrated autocorrelation time iat which is the number of steps ensemble moves required for the chain to produce independent samples from the true parameter s posterior distribution after convergence the python package arviz kumar et al 2016 is used to calculate further diagnostic metrics such as the high density intervals hdis and the effective sample size further details about mcmc sampling and convergence assessment are reported in the supplementary material 2 4 multifidelity surrogate analysis 2 4 1 the multifidelity approach a schematic of the multifidelity modelling approach is shown in fig 2 as noted above this study sought to produce both a high fidelity model and a cheap to run low fidelity model because our purpose was to elucidate the hydrological role of an intercropped faidherbia tree in the underlying vadose zone our high fidelity model was designed to 1 reproduce field scale observations and 2 describe variably saturated water flows and root water uptakes of crops as well as the tree to overcome the lack of detailed information about root distribution crown morphology and soil heterogeneity the high fidelity model assumes that these aspects of the tree soil domain are two dimensionally axisymmetric deb et al 2013 showed that this assumption is effective and accurate the resulting pseudo 3d discretization uses a dense 2d finite element mesh and allows the modeler to infer the spatial variability of water fluxes and root water uptake a in fig 3 in contrast the low fidelity model conceptualizes processes in the soil tree domain as strictly one dimensional b in fig 3 this strong simplification of the domain s spatial variability reduces computing time but risks biasing the calibration procedure the present study mitigates this issue at least partially in two ways we start by using the same theoretical framework for both models high and low fidelity then we correct the response of the low fidelity model by using a multifidelity surrogate approach with an embedded response surface emulator in this way it is possible to maximize the computational efficiency while maintaining the theoretical accuracy of the high fidelity model to reduce the computational cost of the bayesian analysis the multifidelity approach that is used here combines the computationally efficient low fidelity 1d vertical model b in fig 3 and fig 4 with an additive correction function to approximate the response of the computationally intensive high fidelity 2d axisymmetric model a in fig 3 and fig 4 gano et al 2006 leary et al 2003 viana et al 2009 wu et al 2020 j zhang et al 2018 specifically the aggregated log likelihood obtained from the high fidelity model lh u is approximated by adding a correction function g u to the aggregated log likelihood that is calculated via the low fidelity model ll u 10 l h u l l u g u because the exact form of g u is unknown an approximation to it is built by using a gaussian process that is based on the kriging technique which is trained on a relatively low number of high and low fidelity model executions kriging belonging to the class of gaussian process emulators rasmussen williams 2006 sacks et al 1989 combines a polynomial model with a localized deviation model that is based upon a spatial correlation of samples 11 g u f u z u where f u is a function that approximates the response surface through a set of points in the parameters space the vector z u is the result of a stochastic process with zero mean and nonzero covariance the parameters in z u are optimized for the sake of brevity mathematical details about kriging are not reported here thorough theoretical descriptions of using the kriging method for surrogate analysis are given in forrester et al 2008 and kennedy and o hagan 2001 2 4 2 training and validation of the multifidelity surrogate the preliminary training and validation phases verify the capability of the surrogate to accurately reproduce the response of the high fidelity model the training validation procedure is iterative as described below the latin hypercube sampling generates a set of parameters mckay et al 1979 which is used to initially train the kriging based correction function the training sample size s is set based on the relation proposed by jones et al 1998 eq 12 12 s 10 d where d is the dimensionality of the parameters space equal to 15 in the present study thus leading to a total of 150 initial training sites a for loop is used to iterate through the training samples and calculate the aggregated log likelihood i e eq 9 for both the high and low fidelity models and for each parameters set the training set is used to optimize hyperparameters of the kriging based correction function and obtain a first multifidelity surrogate the surrogate is combined with the mcmc to estimate a first approximation of the parameters posterior distribution the final position of the chains i e 100 solutions is used to calculate the aggregated log likelihood for both the original high fidelity 2d model and the multifidelity surrogate a dimensionless error metric e compares the response of the original model and the multifidelity surrogate 13 e i 1 k l u high f i d e l i t y l u multifidelity i 1 k l u high f i d e l i t y if the error metric is lower than 1 it is assumed that the surrogate well approximates the response of the original model in high likelihood regions and the validation is successful if the error metric is higher than 1 the posterior solutions are added to training set and the process restarts from step 2 by iteratively adding posterior solutions to the training set active learning zhang et al 2020 the training procedure guarantees that the surrogate well approximates high likelihood areas in the parameters space this together with the initial well spaced latin hypercube sample assures an efficient coverage of the parameters space 2 4 3 model setup and boundary conditions the previously described equations for water flow and root water uptake were solved using the finite element model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 more specifically we used a non standard version of hydrus model that can simulate root water uptake from two plant species faidherbia and crop rotation of groundnut and pearl millet in 2d the high fidelity axisymmetric 2d domain is discretized into 4 000 2d triangular elements and the low fidelity 1d vertical domains is discretized into 200 1d finite elements both models use a finer mesh near the soil surface in order to provide accurate simulations of pressure head gradients that are induced by atmospheric conditions based upon preliminary soil texture information both models discretize the vadose zone profile into three separate soil horizons 1 an upper soil layer from 0 to 100 cm i e to the 100 cm depth 2 an intermediate soil layer between 100 and 200 cm and 3 a deeper soil layer from 200 to 600 cm in both models the spatial distributions of the densities of crop and tree roots are constant in time however the spatial distributions are more detailed in the high fidelity model than in the low fidelity one in particular the high fidelity model assumes that faidherbia roots extend beyond the dripline area that the root density is higher outside of the canopy and that the root density increases with depth until the capillary fringe a in fig 4 roupsard et al 1999 at any distance from the tree the root density of crops at the surface is assumed to increase linearly with depth down to the maximum rooting depth of 100 cm the simpler low fidelity model too assumes that root densities of crops increase linearly with depth b in fig 4 but also assumes that the distribution is the same for all distances from the tree fig 4 also shows the distribution of the boundary conditions bcs for the two models the atmospheric boundary condition at the soil surface includes precipitation potential soil evaporation and potential transpiration the pressure head at the soil surface cannot exceed in absolute value the minimum allowed pressure head hcrit no flux is allowed through the vertical sides of the transport domain due to symmetry finally a dirichlet type variable head bc is set at the bottom of the domain to simulate measured water table fluctuations 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration 3 1 1 mcmc diagnostic the surrogate training required in total 250 runs of the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model to reduce the surrogate approximation error e to 0 94 the validated multifidelity surrogate was then used for the bayesian inference via the mcmc algorithm which required 4 000 steps and a total of 400 000 surrogate model evaluations to achieve the iat convergence threshold a in fig 5 the mean acceptance fraction was 0 19 which is considered to be a satisfactory value if the posterior distribution is multivariate gaussian gelman et al 2004 the satisfactory performance of the sampler is further demonstrated by the good mixing of the chains in the ensemble b and c in fig 5 and is proven statistically by the average ess value 637 table 1 it must be emphasized that performing 400 000 simulations with the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model would require approximately 90 days on the available computer inteli citm i7 8750h cpu 2 20 ghz ram 16 gb in contrast only four days were necessary to complete the bayesian analysis with the multifidelity surrogate 3 1 2 model predictive checks fig 6 shows a comparison between the model predictive uncertainty bands blue and green areas mean posterior solutions solid lines and measured values grey circles of sap flow sa and volumetric water contents θ at eight different depths the predictive bands and the mean posterior solutions were obtained by propagating the calculated high density intervals hdis and mean solutions respectively table 1 into the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model the results indicate that the model reproduces with satisfactory accuracy and low predictive uncertainty both the water distribution in the soil and the actual transpiration dynamics during the calibration period although the deviation between modelled and predicted volumetric water contents increases with depth the error remains limited as confirmed by the root mean square errors rmses calculated for the mean solution from the parameters posterior distributions the predicted sap flows exhibit a time shift error especially during november 2019 and january 2020 those periods coincide with the end of the rainy season and faidherbia s re greening period the time shift can be partially attributed to inconsistencies between the actual sap flow and the measured lai which the model used to partition evapotranspiration fluxes in particular the underestimation of the actual sap flows may be the numerical result of the underestimated lais which in turn led the model to predict low potential transpiration fluxes we also note that the macroscopic root water uptake approach used in hydrus approximates the actual transpiration process only conceptually in contrast sap flow measurements are a good albeit imperfect indicator of transpiration meinzer et al 2004 therefore the model s time shift error appears to be a consequence of the nature of the lai data rather than an indication of deficiencies in the models in summary the model interpret the dynamics of faidherbia s transpiration well and the model predictive checks on the whole do not indicate significant systematic discrepancies between model predictions and observations gelman et al 2004 thus results from the calibration phase suggest that the model can explain the underlying hydrological processes satisfactorily 3 1 3 assessment of the parameters the calculated mean and 3 and 97 high density intervals hdis of the parameters posterior distributions are reported in table 1 they indicate that the inverse problem is well posed with an acceptable level of uncertainty hdis are generally narrow except for the saturated soil water contents θs and hydraulic conductivities ks which have larger uncertainties those uncertainties can be partially explained by the limited range of the volumetric water contents measured during 2019 2021 which never approached the saturated values thus those measurements were mainly informative of the dry end of the retention and conductivity curves the relatively high estimated values of ks might be explained by the finding of lu et al 2020 that in coarse soils tree roots can increase ks up to 1 085 by inducing the formation of macropores therefore the high ks values that we found suggest that in the area of study macropore formation and or preferential flow was occurring in the root zone this behaviour was already observed by bargués tobella et al 2014 who investigated the effect of scattered trees upon soil infiltrability in an agroforestry parkland in burkina faso in that study dye tracer experiments demonstrated that preferential flow and infiltrability were significantly higher under shea trees canopies than in the surrounding open areas in particular the joint action of tree roots and high organic matter contents from litter inputs increases the macroporosity thus creating preferred pathways for water flow moreover the potential effect of other occurring mechanisms such as stemflow and film flow along roots nikodem et al 2010 are not properly accounted in the model but lumped in the soil hydraulic parameters nevertheless the relatively high uncertainty in the estimation of ks suggests that more specific measurements are required to better characterize the hydraulic behaviour of the system overall estimated soil hydraulic parameters are consistent with the measured soil textural composition in that the parameters reproduce the hydraulic properties of a highly permeable sandy soil whose fine fraction increases with depth the corresponding decrease of the coarse material is reflected in the lower value of the shape parameter n 3 for the deeper soil layer which contains more clay 2 9 5 5 and silt 29 3 34 7 but less sand 67 8 59 8 estimated saturated water contents θs range between 0 2 and 0 45 which would be typical for the soil that is investigated in the present study more interesting are the root water uptake parameters the value of the estimated root adaptability factor ωc indicates that root water uptake is moderately compensated this finding supports the hypotheses of roupsard et al 1999 roupsard et al 2022 about the phreatophytic behaviour of faidherbia in particular results from the calibration procedure indicate that roots are able to meet the transpiration demand by extracting more soil water via the less stressed part of the roots until ωc reaches a value between approximately 0 31 and 0 48 at that point the roots as a whole start to experience some stress deb et al 2013 used a similar value of ωc to simulate the compensated root water uptake of a pecan tree in another study wang et al 2022 showed how a ωc value between 0 3 and 0 7 led to optimal results when simulating transpiration dynamics of the phreatophyte tamarix ramosissima the estimated pressure head at which the root water uptake is reduced by 50 h 50 is relatively low in absolute value it ranges from 140 1 to 54 5 cm similar values were used by yin et al 2018 to simulate transpiration patterns in the phreatophyte salix matsudana our h 50 values together with the estimated value of the shape parameter p suggest that the model treats the uptake reduction as essentially a step function under moderately wet conditions the actual and potential transpiration are close according to the model but they will diverge as the pressure head increases in absolute value and soil pores desaturate skaggs et al 2006a this prediction is physically realistic for sandy soils zhu et al 2009 like the one investigated in the present study it must be emphasized that because this study presents the first detailed simulation to our knowledge of faidherbia s phreatophytic behaviour it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between our estimated root water uptake parameters and those from other existing studies on faidherbia however comparisons with the existing literature on other phreatophytes as well as the discussion about the physical meaning of the root water uptake parameters suggest that the model provides a good approximation of faidherbia s macroscopic behaviour of and its influence upon water fluxes in the vadose zone 3 1 4 model validation to validate the high fidelity 2d axisymmetric hydrus 2d model we propagated into it the parameters estimated posterior distributions table 1 fig 7 shows a comparison between the model predictive uncertainty bands blue and green areas the mean posterior solution solid lines and measured values grey circles of sap flow sa and volumetric water contents θ at eight different depths the model predictive performance generally remained satisfactory but the bias was greater than during the calibration period this observation is confirmed by the rmse values that were calculated for the mean solution from the parameters posterior distributions those values now range between 0 014 and 0 021 cm3 cm 3 for the volumetric water content and reach 0 019 cm day 1 for the sap flow while the model approximates water distribution well in the upper soil horizons the deviation between model predictions and measurements is greater for deeper soil layers in particular the model seems to systematically anticipate the arrival of the moisture front for z 100 cm while still reproducing the peak timing and soil drying well for 100 cm z 200 cm this result suggests an imperfect modelling of the soil wetting process a deficiency that can be partially explained by the higher frequency of soil drying data in the calibration dataset fig 6 nor is it possible to rule out possible effects of soil heterogeneity macropore flow and measurement inaccuracies more evident is the model s overestimation of the sap flow compared to during the calibration phase although the transpiration pattern is again well reproduced the fitting could probably have been improved through a different apportioning of computation time between the calibration and validation periods e g by extending the calibration and shortening the validation as well by making the model more detailed e g increasing the soil layering however greater detail would have increased the computational cost of the analysis by increasing both the dimensionality of the inverse problem and the complexity of the multifidelity surrogate training overall results from the validation phase do not provide grounds for rejecting the model instead the model s predictive performance remains satisfactory for the purpose of the analysis which is to understand water fluxes in the vadose zone below faidherbia trees 3 1 5 hydrological interpretation of water fluxes the interpretations that follow are based upon results from the validated high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model using the parameters estimated posterior distributions 3 1 6 partitioning of the water fluxes a study of fig 8 shows that the model predictive uncertainty is low except for the actual transpiration of faidherbia sa tree and the groundwater recharge r the uncertainty of these parameter is attributable to the relatively high uncertainties of the root parameters themselves the predicted daily actual evaporation fluxes ea are low during the december to june dry seasons mean 6 6 0 4 104 cm3 d 1 these ea values are representative of second stage evaporation during which high pressure heads at the surface limit the upward water fluxes conversely the model predicts higher ea values during the wet seasons as expected because of the moister soil conditions specifically the average predicted ea for the wet season is 5 32 1 0 105 cm3 d 1 and the maximum which occurs during rainy days is 1 55 0 7 106 cm3 d 1 a in fig 8 wet seasons are also the times when local farmers practice the rainfed rotation of groundnut as they did in 2019 and 2021 and pearl millet in 2020 the simulated daily actual transpiration of those crops sa crop ranges from 5 7 0 0 103 to 8 2 1 7 104 cm3 d 1 in the early growing stage late july early august versus 1 72 0 0 104 to 5 4 0 02 105 cm3 d 1 during the vegetative stage september predicted values of sa crop are higher under groundnut max 4 95 0 45 105 cm3 d 1 mean 0 52 0 03 105 cm3 d 1 than under pearl millet max 3 58 0 01 105 cm3 d 1 mean 0 37 0 08 105 cm3 d 1 this outcome is the result of groundnut s higher lai the partitionings of ea and sa crop as derived from the high fidelity 2d model are similar to those which diongue et al 2022b computed via hydrus 1d for location at the study area that are outside of the trees radius of influence i e 30 m away from any tree the predicted seasonal variations of faidherbia s actual transpiration sa tree are opposite to those of the crops as is consistent with the species reverse phenology faidherbia s predicted flux becomes negligible during the rainy season but increases after the onset of leafing specifically faidherbia s predicted flux is around 1 48 0 56 102 cm3 d 1 in late september and early october and the maximums mean 5 17 3 75 104 cm3 d 1 occur during january february interestingly the onset of leafing of this phreatophyte species is paced with the groundwater recharge rate r roupsard et al 2022 which varies from 0 44 0 15 106 cm3 d 1 in 2021 to 1 14 0 01 106 cm3 d 1 in 2019 c and d in fig 8 the model predicts that at the annual scale ea is the main component of the water balance ranging from 8 4 2 6 107 cm3 y 1 in 2019 52 3 16 4 of the year s total precipitation p to 11 1 2 4 107 cm3 y 1 in 2020 58 7 13 of p the second largest component is r which varied between 3 7 2 7 107 cm3 y 1 in 2021 24 4 17 6 of p and 5 1 1 1 107 cm3 y 1 in 2019 31 3 7 1 of p d in fig 10 the fluxes sa crop and sa tree are the smallest components sa crop ranged from 1 3 0 1 107 cm3 y 1 7 8 0 7 of p in 2019 to 2 6 0 1 107 cm3 y 1 17 2 1 0 of p in 2021 sa tree was even smaller 8 8 7 2 106 to 1 2 0 7 107 cm3 y 1 corresponding to 5 5 4 5 to 7 7 4 9 of p groundwater recharge rates r predicted by the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model are higher than those which have been reported for other semiarid regions e g boumaiza et al 2021 gaj et al 2016 koeniger et al 2016 skrzypek et al 2019 the predicted rates are also higher than those calculated for senegal s groundnut basin by researchers who used unsaturated zone approaches e g profiles of chloride deuterium and tritium in soil water for example edmunds and gaye 1994 gaye and edmunds 1996 who studied chloride profiles at 15 separate sites and tritium profiles at two sites showed that r averaged 5 of p in northern senegal s louga region where the annual precipitation is around 290 mm y 1 similarly diongue et al 2022a found that the average r in the groundnut basin during 2021 was less than 2 of p based upon stable isotope profiles of bulk soil water to understand why the r values predicted by the model are higher than those from unsaturated zone approaches it is important to note that the latter approach postulates that none of the recharge occurs via localized focused paths such as tree induced macropores instead the unsaturated zone approach assumes that all of the recharge occurs diffusely from soil water that percolates through the vadose zone matrix by advection dominated flow therefore the model s high r values highlight the potential impact of faidherbia roots in generating paths for localized recharge bargués tobella et al 2014 ilstedt et al 2016 this impact is consistent with results reported recently by bargués tobella et al 2020 these authors who assessed deep drainage in the openings among trees report that deep drainage in smaller openings where the soil is more likely to contain root induced macropores is 10 times higher than in openings whose centres are 22 m distant from the nearest tree trunk thus bargués tobella et al 2020 highlight the decisive role that tree cover plays in promoting recharge by increasing macropore flow and deep percolation especially near the tree trunk 3 1 7 effect of root adaptability upon the water budget to further investigate the influence of root adaptability factors ωc upon the water budget the validated high fidelity 2d model was used to calculate and compare sa crop sa tree and r under conditions in which faidherbia s root water uptake rwu was variously compensated ωc 0 39 a value that is based upon calibration results and used as baseline fully compensated ωc 0 01 and uncompensated ωc 1 0 the tree s cumulative transpiration the line labelled sa tree in fig 9 is significantly influenced by ωc with values ranging from 1 03 107 cm3 in uncompensated conditions to 2 60 107 cm3 for compensated rwu transpiration remains high 4 58 107 cm3 and similar to potential rates in fully compensated condition resulting in increases of 43 2 and 77 6 compared to compensated and uncompensated root water uptake respectively this large increase is due to the low water holding capacity of sandy soils such as the one investigated in the present study some authors have reported that the enhanced compensated uptake occurs after significant water depletion or after distribution of water stress over the soil profile deb et al 2013 šimůnek hopmans 2009 for example deb et al 2013 reported that the compensated rwu of pecan trees increased by only 8 compared to the uncompensated rwu the small magnitude of that increase was attributed to the water holding capacity of the orchard s silty clay loam soil still the increase was sufficient to avoid severe water stress during the growing season in the present study the compensated rwu had no significant impact upon the crop s cumulative transpiration sa crop in fig 9 which decreased by only 0 2 under fully compensated condition this result is due to faidherbia s reverse phenology because of which the tree competes very little for water with adjacent crops conversely increased rwu by faidherbia in the fully compensated condition results in lower groundwater recharge rates with the cumulative value decreasing by 12 7 and 24 7 respectively compared to uncompensated and compensated rwu this result suggests that root water uptake has an appreciable but moderate effect upon recharge fluxes at the same time faidherbia can alter and potentially increase recharge fluxes through root induce changes in the soil s hydraulic behaviour 3 1 8 spatial distribution of the root water uptake to gain further insight into the strategies that faidherbia employs to mitigate water stress the validated model was used to investigate how the root adaptability factor ωc affects spatial rwu patterns at two times of the year during october when faidherbia begins its leafing at the end of the cropping season and in february the time of maximum leaf density and therefore peak transpiration demand the 2d contour plots in fig 10 show that during both periods the compensated and uncompensated root uptakes from trees rwu tree vary not only with soil depth but also with radial distance from the tree trunk the model s output also shows that in early october 6 10 2020 when pearl millet crop is in its maturity stage then harvested a few days later ωc does not affect root uptake from crops rwu crop at that time rwu crop averages 9 28 10 4 cm3 cm 3 d 1 according to results from the model the amount of water extracted by pearl millet follows the millet s assumed root length distribution specifically rwu crop is a function of depth exclusively at any given depth it is the same at all distances from the tree except within a few cm of the trunk moreover rwu crop is highest at the surface and decreases linearly with depth during the same period early october 6 10 2020 faidherbia s transpiration demand is low and the soil is still relatively wet due to ongoing redistribution of preceding rainfall infiltration faidherbia roots do not experience severe water stress at this time but extract water at higher rates in the deep layers especially outside of the dripline area this result is consistent with faidherbia s root length distribution which is denser outside the tree canopy the rwu tree rates are minimal near the tree trunk and in the upper soil layer but increase gradually with depth from 100 cm downward the highest values occur within the 350 450 cm soil layer at radial distances 300 cm the rates decrease again in the capillary fringe the magnitude and pattern of rwu tree rates for compensated uptake mean 1 99 10 7 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and uncompensated uptake 0 77 10 7 cm3 cm 3 d 1 vary slightly during early october particularly with soil depth a and b in fig 10 indeed to compensate the water stress roots extract water at higher rates in the deep layers thanks to the combined effect of 1 higher root density and 2 wetter soil and lower pressure head gradient compared to the shallow layer the spatial pattern of rwu tree in february differs substantially from october s due to soil drying which is induced by the limited holding capacity of the sandy media and the higher transpiration demand of faidherbia in addition roots experience more water stress in february than during october and the magnitudes of rwutree are higher the mean compensated rwu is 2 98 10 5 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and the mean uncompensated rwu is 1 17 10 5 cm3 cm 3 d 1 hence the depth distribution of rwu tree is driven not only by the most densely rooted soil layers but also by the soil water conditions these hydrological behaviours of faidherbia confirm its suitability for sahelian agroforestry because of its reverse phenology faidherbia extracts comparatively little water throughout the cropping season making this tree only a minor competing species for water with the adjacent crops note that ωc has no significant effect upon rwucrop furthermore the study area s low density stands of faidherbia consume less than 10 of p and use deep water to mitigate water stress 4 summary and conclusions the main goal of this study was to provide further insights into the hydrological impact of faidherbia in arid areas by combining diverse experimental data and mechanistic modelling to overcome the computational bottleneck a multifidelity surrogate based approach was adopted the proposed surrogate merges a one dimensional low fidelity description of the vadose zone beneath faidherbia hydrus 1d with a kriging based correction function to emulate the response of a high fidelity two dimensional axisymmetric representation of the domain hydrus 2d after training and validation a probabilistic framework based upon bayesian inference is used to calibrate the surrogate and to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters the comparison between model predictions and observations confirms the good predictive accuracy and limited predictive uncertainty of the model during calibration as well as validation and thus supports the use of multifidelity surrogates as an efficient tool for reducing the computational cost of calibrating mechanistic models the values of the surrogate based estimated soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters suggest that faidherbia induces changes in the soil hydraulic properties these values also confirm the phreatophytic behaviour of faidherbia in particular the high values calculated for the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks in all soil horizons support the existence of macropore related and or root induced preferential flow which increases recharge rates significantly this finding has been reported in other studies but should be further investigated by performing comprehensive measurements of the root distribution and morphology combined with tracer experiments to provide more informative data for calibrating models these data would make possible a robust comparison via bayesian modelling in which the current unimodal richards based description of the water flow is tested against dual domain or gravity driven formulations that better describe preferential and macropore flow by identifying the most appropriate model structure such a comparison might confirm and assess the magnitude of these root induced fast flows thus further strengthening the findings of the present study which indicates that of faidherbia has a net positive effect upon the hydrological balance of arid areas these detailed mechanistic analyses should be theoretically complemented by a watershed hydrological modelling to have a broader understanding of water fluxes in the agroforestry parkland credit authorship contribution statement djim m l diongue conceptualization writing original draft investigation giuseppe

1791,the faidherbia tree faidherbia albida is frequently used as an intercrop in sahelian agroforestry parklands due to its multi purpose advantages and reverse phenology however its effect upon the water balance remains unclear due to the challenges in directly measuring water fluxes in the underlying vadose zone mechanistic hydrological models can be inversely calibrated on transient observations and used to partition different hydrological components but the computational burden of the analysis can become impractical if the model itself is computationally expensive to overcome this limitation and to provide novel insights into the hydrological role of faidherbia we combine a low fidelity one dimensional hydrological model hydrus 1d with a kriging based correction function to emulate the response of a high fidelity two dimensional axisymmetric description of the system hydrus 2d multiannual measurements of soil moisture and sap flow in a senegal agroforestry parkland are used in conjunction with bayesian inference to calibrate the resulting validated multifidelity surrogate and to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters results show that the model can reproduce observations with good accuracy and limited uncertainty for both the calibration and the validation phases and also confirm the phreatophytic behaviour of faidherbia by indicating the existence of a moderately compensated root water uptake moreover a local sensitivity analysis suggests that a fully compensated uptake could potentially reduce groundwater recharge by 13 interestingly estimated soil hydraulic parameters hint at the possibility of root induced changes in soil hydraulic properties that mimic preferential and or macropore flow resulting in sustained recharge fluxes 26 of the annual precipitation the analysis indicates that overall faidherbia could have a net positive effect upon the water balance in arid areas keywords arid areas hydrus surrogate calibration phreatophyte data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions cover 40 of the earth s land area koutroulis 2019 and host about 3 billion people worldwide van der esch et al 2017 these regions are home to unique biodiversity and rich cultural heritages maestre et al 2015 and provide essential ecosystem services bidak et al 2015 n lu et al 2018 however the sustainable development of these areas may be seriously jeopardized by ecological issues that accrue from scarcity of water resources e g lack of surface water and low amounts of precipitation kuriqi et al 2019 in sub saharan africa ssa arid regions are predicted to expand due to climate change feng fu 2013 the resulting combination of high temperatures extremely variable rainfall low soil fertility and recurrent but unpredictable droughts will threaten agriculture and food production in addition the rapid growth of megacities increases competition for water resources cherlet et al 2018 because the region lacks perennial surface water groundwater is often the only source for meeting urban industrial and agricultural needs lapworth et al 2017 macdonald et al 2012 therefore optimal use of groundwater is crucial for ssa s development including the region s rural economies fao 1999 optimizing that use requires an understanding of the hydrological impact of the region s agricultural practices one such practice is agroforestry parklands which are widespread because of their economic social and environmental benefits mbow et al 2014 in the agroforestry parklands of senegal pearl millet and groundnut are often the major crops however the parklands impact upon water balance is still unclear jackson et al 2005 suggest that transpiration by the parklands large intercropped trees is detrimental to that balance but other studies show that the trees roots increase groundwater recharge by altering soil hydraulic properties bargués tobella et al 2014 ilstedt et al 2016 the intercropped tree species faidherbia albida del a chev syn acacia albida del is investigated extensively in the agricultural and ecological literature barnes fagg 2003 its uncommon reverse phenology shedding all of its leaves at the beginning of the rainy season wickens 1969 benefits the major crops by providing a significant nitrogen input to the topsoil at the growing season a further benefit for the major crops is that the leafless tree canopies intercept less light and rainfall rhoades 1995 because of these benefits much effort has been devoted to understanding the faidherbia effect upon ecosystem services and crops louppe et al 1996 tschakert et al 2004 roupsard et al 2020 leroux et al 2020 faye et al 2021 t lu et al 2022 dierks et al 2022 to understand how faidherbia s sustains its peculiar reverse phenology in an arid region roupsard et al 1999 studied the species sap flows and water potentials and the isotopic compositions of relevant water fractions the results showed that faidherbia obtains most of its water from the groundwater thus enabling this species to grow during the dry season with little indication of drought stress however faidherbia s hydrological impact remains poorly understood despite all of this scientific effort the main difficulty lies in measuring water fluxes in the vadose zone beneath the trees these fluxes can be inferred from other measurements but the results frequently fail to tie together all components of the hydrological balance coherently an additional challenge to understanding these fluxes is the multidimensional morphological complexity of the tree roots spatial distribution a comprehensive theoretical framework for reproducing that complexity is offered by mechanistic vadose zone hydrological models such as hydrus or swap van dam et al 2008 šimůnek et al 2016 these models can discriminate the different water balance components but to do so the models must describe the system s hydrologic functioning satisfactorily satisfactory descriptions can be generally achieved by combining data from multiple transient observations e g transpiration rates and volumetric water content with specific numerical techniques e g bayesian inference and optimization strategies to calibrate and validate the model and therefore to assess its predictive uncertainty brunetti et al 2019a vrugt et al 2008 wöhling and vrugt 2011 once the model is calibrated it can be used to probabilistically separate all hydrological components e g recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes and to discern the effects of physical factors such as roots and soil at present this type of approach presents multiple general and case specific challenges one of these challenges is that the calibration procedure requires thousands of model executions in order to assess the models uncertainties the computational burden of that assessment can easily become prohibitive if the model itself is computationally expensive modelling of fluxes in the soil tree domain is especially susceptible to this problem because the above mentioned morphological complexity of root systems requires a numerical model that is at least 2d axisymmetric i e that has cylindrical symmetry see for example deb et al 2013 supercomputers or distributed computing clusters might be able to handle the job but are not widely available an appealing alternative is to reduce the computational workload by using surrogate based models in place of the complex original high fidelity model razavi et al 2012 when used for calibration purposes surrogate modelling frequently aims to build an emulator that can calculate the objective function or the likelihood for different input parameters as if the function were being computed using the original high fidelity model e g a 2d axisymmetric one because the emulator can do the calculations in much less time the calibration procedure is made feasible brunetti et al 2017 a diversity of water related studies have used so called response surface surrogates successfully including kriging radial basis functions and polynomial chaos expansion asher et al 2015 keating et al 2010 laloy et al 2013 razavi et al 2012 zeng et al 2018 x zhang et al 2009 however when the dimensionality of the inverse problem is moderately high e g 10 the necessary training of these surrogates requires an impractically high number of executions of the high fidelity model in order to achieve a good coverage of the parameters space o hagan 2006 a possible remedy is to use low fidelity physically based surrogates which are essentially cheaper to run approximations of the original complex models for example the surrogate model can be 1d instead of 2d razavi et al 2012 when the surrogate uses the same theoretical framework and parameters as the high fidelity model the discrepancy between their respective response surfaces is expected to be limited this discrepancy can be corrected by using an appropriate function that relates the responses of the low and high fidelity models the so called multifidelity approach develops the necessary correction function by using response surface surrogates which is generally easier to reconstruct because the low fidelity response surface is supposedly a good approximation to the high fidelity one by thus reducing computational cost while mimicking the output of a high fidelity forward model simulation multifidelity surrogate analysis makes itself highly attractive for calibrating vadose zone hydrological models few studies to date have calibrated vadose zone hydrological models via this approach man et al 2018 2021 zheng et al 2019 therefore the present study uses it to efficiently calibrate and validate a high fidelity two dimensional axisymmetric hydrus model of the vadose zone underlying a faidherbia tree in an agroforestry parkland in senegal the data used in the validation are from multiannual comprehensive measurements of sap flows and of volumetric water contents at different depths the validated multifidelity surrogate merges hydrus 1d and a kriging based correction function to emulate the response of hydrus 2d the surrogate is coupled with a monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithm to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters and to assess the model s predictive uncertainty parameters that were estimated via the surrogate are then transferred into the high fidelity hydrus 2d model for validation purposes then the validated hydrus 2d model is used to discriminate the different water fluxes explain their interrelations and assess their effects upon the hydrological balance the realistic application of a multifidelity surrogate based approach to calibrate a hydrological model of the vadose zone is a novel contribution in this field the results can be valuable for a better understanding of water balances in agroforestry parklands

meteorological data were provided by an automatic station cr1000 campbell sci equipped with classical automatic sensors that made measurements every 30 sec and averaged them to every 30 min measured

lymington uk wind speeds at 2 m were then estimated et0 was computed according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen 1998 to estimate the amount of water used by faidherbia trees we neglected water storage and assumed that the water use was equal to the transpiration which was estimated from sap flows these flows had been measured during 2019 2021 via the single probe transient thermal dissipation method do et al 2011 with a cyclical heating of 600 sec every 30 min the total sap flow lt 1 was calculated for each tree and averaged between trees to yield a mean flow for an average tree of the stand the 2019 2021 experiments also monitored the leaf area indices lais of 15 faidherbia trees including the four whose sap flows were being measured the lais were measured every 10 days using a lai2200 device li cor usa to measure transmittances during 2019 2021 volumetric soil water contents were measured in shaded areas under tree canopies at depths of 20 40 60 80 120 140 160 180 280 and 380 cm these data were recorded using automated time domain reflectometers tdr type cs655 campbell which were installed horizontally in a well that was dug close to the tree the tdrs installed at a depth 180 z 0 cm were locally calibrated with data on gravimetric water contents and bulk densities the calibration procedure is explained in details in the supplementary material in contrast tdr sensors installed at a depth z 180 cm used the factory calibration curve which leads to an accuracy of 3 levels of the groundwater table were continuously recorded from august of 2019 by using pressure sensors rugged troll 100 coupled with baro troll 100 for barometric compensation in situ usa the sensors were emplaced in a piezometer close to the locations of the above mentioned tdrs missing data were gap filled via cubic interpolation a linear interpolation was used to extrapolate data back to january 2019 based upon dry season recession curves soil profiles were sampled at different depth intervals to analyse for dry bulk density and soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay textural analyses were performed at the institute of soil physics and rural water management university of natural resources and life sciences vienna the sand fractions were determined by sieving silt and clay fractions were determined via sedimentation the analyses revealed that in the 0 100 cm depth interval the texture was loamy sand with an average bulk density of 1 7 g cm 3 the clay percentage was uniform at about 2 2 but the sand percentage decreased from 85 4 at the soil surface to 77 8 at 60 cm in contrast the soil from 100 down to 500 cm had a sandy loam texture contents of clay 2 9 5 5 and silt 29 3 34 7 were higher than in the 0 100 cm layer but the sand content was lower 67 8 59 8 densities of tree root lengths were characterized underneath tree canopies and far from them per for this purpose those authors excavated 1 m square sampling pits to a depth of 1 5 m results showed that about 62 of faidherbia s fine roots were distributed within the deep soil layer 100 150 cm versus 35 in the 30 100 layer depth and only 3 in the upper layer 0 30 cm interestingly root densities in the 50 100 cm depth interval were significantly higher outside of the canopy although no root density data for depths 150 cm were investigated via excavation field observations that were made during installation of tdrs indicate that faidherbia roots extend far into the deep layer and the capillary fringe this agrees with what reported in roupsard et al 1999

variably saturated water flow in a 2d axisymmetric domain is described by the following richards equation 1 θ h t 1 r r rk h h r z k h h z 1 s a h where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 h is the pressure head l t is time t r is the radial space coordinate l z is the vertical coordinate l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and sa h is a sink term l3l 3t 1 defined as a volume of water removed from a unit volume of soil per unit of time due to plant water uptake by setting r 0 eq 1 reduces to the one dimensional richards equation soil hydraulic properties are parameterized via the unimodal van genuchten mualem mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 vgm model as follows 2 θ θ s θ r 1 α h n m θ r if h 0 θ s if h 0 3 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 4 k k s θ l 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 i f h 0 k s i f h 0 5 m 1 1 n where θr l3l 3 is the residual soil water content θs l3l 3 is the saturated soil water content ks lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity α l 1 and n are empirical shape parameters l indicates the tortuosity which is frequently assumed equal to 0 5 mualem 1976 and θ is the effective saturation compensated root water uptake and soil water evaporation the reference evapotranspiration demand is partitioned into potential transpiration sp and potential soil water evaporation ep using the measured lai brunetti et al 2019b ritchie 1972 sutanto et al 2012 the following equation converts sp to actual transpiration sa 6 s a h s p 1 s p r s a h x y z d x d y d z r a h x y z b x y z d x d y d z ω where sa h x y z is actual root water uptake l3l 3t 1 a h x y z is a dimensionless water stress response function b x y z is a dimensionless root density distribution function and ω is a dimensionless water stress index eq 6 describes root water uptake for a general three dimensional problem but can be easily particularized for 1d vertical and 2d axisymmetric domains because this study models the hydrological effects of two vegetation species i e faidherbia and groundnut millet their effects are distinguished in the model by first specifying the root density and the potential transpiration rate for each vegetation using the time series of lai and by then using eq 6 to calculate their respective actual root water uptakes their sum of the two uptakes constitutes the actual sink term in eq 1 based upon results from isotope methods roupsard et al 1999 suggested that faidherbia behaves mostly as a phreatophyte but alternatively uses all root compartments along the vadose zone profile to account for this effect the two models incorporate a dimensionless root adaptability factor ωc which modulates the index ω that is presented in eq 6 ωc is a threshold value above which any reduction in root water uptake that occurs in stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by an increased uptake from unstressed parts the range of values for ωc is 0 ωc 1 root water uptake is not compensated when ωc 1 but is fully compensated when ωc 0 for a detailed explanation please see šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the root water stress response a in eq 6 depends upon the soil pressure head h to model this stress we used skaggs et al s 2006b smooth s shaped function 7 a h 1 1 h h 50 p where h 50 is the pressure head value at which the root water uptake is reduced by 50 l and p is a dimensionless empirical shape parameter the a value ranges from 0 to 1 because actual root water uptake depends upon root density the models include a spatially explicit root density function b x y z in eq 6 this function modulates the uptake at each mesh node in the soil domain models and is based on the formulation proposed by vrugt et al 2001 both models neglect the effect of salinity upon root water uptake because no comprehensive measurements from the area of study are available to characterize solute distribution in the soil domain potential soil water evaporation ep is converted to actual evaporation ea as long as the surface is sufficiently moist and the pressure head at the soil surface doesn t exceed the minimum allowed pressure head hcrit l this value hcrit is estimated from the relative humidity and air temperature however to avoid numerical convergence issues when solving the richards equation the models restrict values of hcrit such that the corresponding soil water contents are at least 0 005 higher than the residual water content θr l3l 3 2 3 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 2 3 1 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters the richards equation and the root water uptake equations i e eq 1 and 6 include several parameters that must be defined in the present study we fixed the values of some of these parameters and calibrated the others based upon the volumetric water content and sap flow observations from 2019 to 2021 specifically the residual water content θr is set to 0 for all soil horizons because the soil is mainly sandy brunetti et al 2020 the tortuosity factor l is set to the common value of 0 5 van genuchten 1980 for groundnut millet the root water uptake parameters h 50 and p are set equal to 800 cm and 3 respectively these values provide a good approximation to the piecewise linear feddes function used by diongue et al 2022b to describe the actual root water uptake of groundnut millet by using these assumptions only 15 model parameters needed to be calibrated including the saturated water content θs the vgm shape parameters α and n the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for three soil horizons the root adaptability factor ωc and root water uptake parameters h50 and p 2 3 2 bayesian inference the bayesian inference is used to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters and to therefore assess their uncertainty the definition of a parameters prior distribution and a likelihood function are required to infer the parameters posterior distribution the prior distribution is set to be bounded uniform for all parameters upper and lower bounds table 1 are chosen based on the prior information available regarding the soil textural composition followed by a comprehensive literature review selection of the likelihood functions took into consideration the types of observations that are included in the bayesian framework and the characteristics of each observation s measurement errors to a large degree those observations consisted of soil moisture measurements because the final calibrated model is intended to reproduce the deterministic part of each observed signal the error model for each measurement should approximate the properties of the measurement s remaining stochastic part that part depends upon the measurement device the tdr cs655 that was used to measure soil moisture during the 2019 2021 field study determines the velocity of electromagnetic pulses as they traverse a wave guide that is inserted into the soil the pulses are independent of each other thereby excluding the possibility of autocorrelation in the measurements errors moreover the procedure that was used for calibrating the tdr cs655 in the upper soil layers led to gaussian homoscedastic residuals caldwell et al 2018 with σ 0 015 supplementary material for these reasons we assumed that the error residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with constant variance σ 2 those assumptions lead to the following form for the log likelihood function ℓ u 8 ℓ u k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 1 2 σ 2 i 1 k y i u y i 2 where k is the number of observations yi u and ỹi u are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively it is worth noting that although other forms of the likelihood function e g first order autoregressive wöhling vrugt 2011 might improve the quality of the model s fitting they could also compromise the objectivity of subsequent assessments of the model s adequacy for that reason we opted to use a traditional measurement motivated gaussian likelihood function followed by model predictive checks for both the calibration and validation period to discuss the model adequacy because the calibration procedure includes sap flows and locally and factory calibrated tdr measurements the final log likelihood function l u is the aggregated sum of single log likelihoods for each jth measurements set 9 l u j 1 3 ℓ j u σ are assumed equal to 0 01 cm day for the sap flow 0 015 and 0 03 for the locally i e 180 z 0 cm and factory i e z 180 cm calibrated volumetric water contents respectively having selected the prior distribution and likelihood function for each of the 15 parameters we then used a hybrid monte carlo markov chain mcmc ensemble sampler to estimate the parameters posterior distributions the algorithm combines the differential evolution snooker move developed by ter braak and vrugt 2008 with the affine invariant stretch move proposed by goodman and weare 2010 to improve the algorithm convergence chains were initialized by random sampling from a multivariate normal distribution that is centred upon the global optimum xopt this optimum was identified via the gradient based comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization g clpso that brunetti et al 2022 developed for the hydrus model the main diagnostic for monitoring the convergence of the mcmc sampler was the integrated autocorrelation time iat which is the number of steps ensemble moves required for the chain to produce independent samples from the true parameter s posterior distribution after convergence the python package arviz kumar et al 2016 is used to calculate further diagnostic metrics such as the high density intervals hdis and the effective sample size further details about mcmc sampling and convergence assessment are reported in the supplementary material 2 4 multifidelity surrogate analysis 2 4 1 the multifidelity approach a schematic of the multifidelity modelling approach is shown in fig 2 as noted above this study sought to produce both a high fidelity model and a cheap to run low fidelity model because our purpose was to elucidate the hydrological role of an intercropped faidherbia tree in the underlying vadose zone our high fidelity model was designed to 1 reproduce field scale observations and 2 describe variably saturated water flows and root water uptakes of crops as well as the tree to overcome the lack of detailed information about root distribution crown morphology and soil heterogeneity the high fidelity model assumes that these aspects of the tree soil domain are two dimensionally axisymmetric deb et al 2013 showed that this assumption is effective and accurate the resulting pseudo 3d discretization uses a dense 2d finite element mesh and allows the modeler to infer the spatial variability of water fluxes and root water uptake a in fig 3 in contrast the low fidelity model conceptualizes processes in the soil tree domain as strictly one dimensional b in fig 3 this strong simplification of the domain s spatial variability reduces computing time but risks biasing the calibration procedure the present study mitigates this issue at least partially in two ways we start by using the same theoretical framework for both models high and low fidelity then we correct the response of the low fidelity model by using a multifidelity surrogate approach with an embedded response surface emulator in this way it is possible to maximize the computational efficiency while maintaining the theoretical accuracy of the high fidelity model to reduce the computational cost of the bayesian analysis the multifidelity approach that is used here combines the computationally efficient low fidelity 1d vertical model b in fig 3 and fig 4 with an additive correction function to approximate the response of the computationally intensive high fidelity 2d axisymmetric model a in fig 3 and fig 4 gano et al 2006 leary et al 2003 viana et al 2009 wu et al 2020 j zhang et al 2018 specifically the aggregated log likelihood obtained from the high fidelity model lh u is approximated by adding a correction function g u to the aggregated log likelihood that is calculated via the low fidelity model ll u 10 l h u l l u g u because the exact form of g u is unknown an approximation to it is built by using a gaussian process that is based on the kriging technique which is trained on a relatively low number of high and low fidelity model executions kriging belonging to the class of gaussian process emulators rasmussen williams 2006 sacks et al 1989 combines a polynomial model with a localized deviation model that is based upon a spatial correlation of samples 11 g u f u z u where f u is a function that approximates the response surface through a set of points in the parameters space the vector z u is the result of a stochastic process with zero mean and nonzero covariance the parameters in z u are optimized for the sake of brevity mathematical details about kriging are not reported here thorough theoretical descriptions of using the kriging method for surrogate analysis are given in forrester et al 2008 and kennedy and o hagan 2001 2 4 2 training and validation of the multifidelity surrogate the preliminary training and validation phases verify the capability of the surrogate to accurately reproduce the response of the high fidelity model the training validation procedure is iterative as described below the latin hypercube sampling generates a set of parameters mckay et al 1979 which is used to initially train the kriging based correction function the training sample size s is set based on the relation proposed by jones et al 1998 eq 12 12 s 10 d where d is the dimensionality of the parameters space equal to 15 in the present study thus leading to a total of 150 initial training sites a for loop is used to iterate through the training samples and calculate the aggregated log likelihood i e eq 9 for both the high and low fidelity models and for each parameters set the training set is used to optimize hyperparameters of the kriging based correction function and obtain a first multifidelity surrogate the surrogate is combined with the mcmc to estimate a first approximation of the parameters posterior distribution the final position of the chains i e 100 solutions is used to calculate the aggregated log likelihood for both the original high fidelity 2d model and the multifidelity surrogate a dimensionless error metric e compares the response of the original model and the multifidelity surrogate 13 e i 1 k l u high f i d e l i t y l u multifidelity i 1 k l u high f i d e l i t y if the error metric is lower than 1 it is assumed that the surrogate well approximates the response of the original model in high likelihood regions and the validation is successful if the error metric is higher than 1 the posterior solutions are added to training set and the process restarts from step 2 by iteratively adding posterior solutions to the training set active learning zhang et al 2020 the training procedure guarantees that the surrogate well approximates high likelihood areas in the parameters space this together with the initial well spaced latin hypercube sample assures an efficient coverage of the parameters space 2 4 3 model setup and boundary conditions the previously described equations for water flow and root water uptake were solved using the finite element model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 more specifically we used a non standard version of hydrus model that can simulate root water uptake from two plant species faidherbia and crop rotation of groundnut and pearl millet in 2d the high fidelity axisymmetric 2d domain is discretized into 4 000 2d triangular elements and the low fidelity 1d vertical domains is discretized into 200 1d finite elements both models use a finer mesh near the soil surface in order to provide accurate simulations of pressure head gradients that are induced by atmospheric conditions based upon preliminary soil texture information both models discretize the vadose zone profile into three separate soil horizons 1 an upper soil layer from 0 to 100 cm i e to the 100 cm depth 2 an intermediate soil layer between 100 and 200 cm and 3 a deeper soil layer from 200 to 600 cm in both models the spatial distributions of the densities of crop and tree roots are constant in time however the spatial distributions are more detailed in the high fidelity model than in the low fidelity one in particular the high fidelity model assumes that faidherbia roots extend beyond the dripline area that the root density is higher outside of the canopy and that the root density increases with depth until the capillary fringe a in fig 4 roupsard et al 1999 at any distance from the tree the root density of crops at the surface is assumed to increase linearly with depth down to the maximum rooting depth of 100 cm the simpler low fidelity model too assumes that root densities of crops increase linearly with depth b in fig 4 but also assumes that the distribution is the same for all distances from the tree fig 4 also shows the distribution of the boundary conditions bcs for the two models the atmospheric boundary condition at the soil surface includes precipitation potential soil evaporation and potential transpiration the pressure head at the soil surface cannot exceed in absolute value the minimum allowed pressure head hcrit no flux is allowed through the vertical sides of the transport domain due to symmetry finally a dirichlet type variable head bc is set at the bottom of the domain to simulate measured water table fluctuations 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration 3 1 1 mcmc diagnostic the surrogate training required in total 250 runs of the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model to reduce the surrogate approximation error e to 0 94 the validated multifidelity surrogate was then used for the bayesian inference via the mcmc algorithm which required 4 000 steps and a total of 400 000 surrogate model evaluations to achieve the iat convergence threshold a in fig 5 the mean acceptance fraction was 0 19 which is considered to be a satisfactory value if the posterior distribution is multivariate gaussian gelman et al 2004 the satisfactory performance of the sampler is further demonstrated by the good mixing of the chains in the ensemble b and c in fig 5 and is proven statistically by the average ess value 637 table 1 it must be emphasized that performing 400 000 simulations with the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model would require approximately 90 days on the available computer inteli citm i7 8750h cpu 2 20 ghz ram 16 gb in contrast only four days were necessary to complete the bayesian analysis with the multifidelity surrogate 3 1 2 model predictive checks fig 6 shows a comparison between the model predictive uncertainty bands blue and green areas mean posterior solutions solid lines and measured values grey circles of sap flow sa and volumetric water contents θ at eight different depths the predictive bands and the mean posterior solutions were obtained by propagating the calculated high density intervals hdis and mean solutions respectively table 1 into the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model the results indicate that the model reproduces with satisfactory accuracy and low predictive uncertainty both the water distribution in the soil and the actual transpiration dynamics during the calibration period although the deviation between modelled and predicted volumetric water contents increases with depth the error remains limited as confirmed by the root mean square errors rmses calculated for the mean solution from the parameters posterior distributions the predicted sap flows exhibit a time shift error especially during november 2019 and january 2020 those periods coincide with the end of the rainy season and faidherbia s re greening period the time shift can be partially attributed to inconsistencies between the actual sap flow and the measured lai which the model used to partition evapotranspiration fluxes in particular the underestimation of the actual sap flows may be the numerical result of the underestimated lais which in turn led the model to predict low potential transpiration fluxes we also note that the macroscopic root water uptake approach used in hydrus approximates the actual transpiration process only conceptually in contrast sap flow measurements are a good albeit imperfect indicator of transpiration meinzer et al 2004 therefore the model s time shift error appears to be a consequence of the nature of the lai data rather than an indication of deficiencies in the models in summary the model interpret the dynamics of faidherbia s transpiration well and the model predictive checks on the whole do not indicate significant systematic discrepancies between model predictions and observations gelman et al 2004 thus results from the calibration phase suggest that the model can explain the underlying hydrological processes satisfactorily 3 1 3 assessment of the parameters the calculated mean and 3 and 97 high density intervals hdis of the parameters posterior distributions are reported in table 1 they indicate that the inverse problem is well posed with an acceptable level of uncertainty hdis are generally narrow except for the saturated soil water contents θs and hydraulic conductivities ks which have larger uncertainties those uncertainties can be partially explained by the limited range of the volumetric water contents measured during 2019 2021 which never approached the saturated values thus those measurements were mainly informative of the dry end of the retention and conductivity curves the relatively high estimated values of ks might be explained by the finding of lu et al 2020 that in coarse soils tree roots can increase ks up to 1 085 by inducing the formation of macropores therefore the high ks values that we found suggest that in the area of study macropore formation and or preferential flow was occurring in the root zone this behaviour was already observed by bargués tobella et al 2014 who investigated the effect of scattered trees upon soil infiltrability in an agroforestry parkland in burkina faso in that study dye tracer experiments demonstrated that preferential flow and infiltrability were significantly higher under shea trees canopies than in the surrounding open areas in particular the joint action of tree roots and high organic matter contents from litter inputs increases the macroporosity thus creating preferred pathways for water flow moreover the potential effect of other occurring mechanisms such as stemflow and film flow along roots nikodem et al 2010 are not properly accounted in the model but lumped in the soil hydraulic parameters nevertheless the relatively high uncertainty in the estimation of ks suggests that more specific measurements are required to better characterize the hydraulic behaviour of the system overall estimated soil hydraulic parameters are consistent with the measured soil textural composition in that the parameters reproduce the hydraulic properties of a highly permeable sandy soil whose fine fraction increases with depth the corresponding decrease of the coarse material is reflected in the lower value of the shape parameter n 3 for the deeper soil layer which contains more clay 2 9 5 5 and silt 29 3 34 7 but less sand 67 8 59 8 estimated saturated water contents θs range between 0 2 and 0 45 which would be typical for the soil that is investigated in the present study more interesting are the root water uptake parameters the value of the estimated root adaptability factor ωc indicates that root water uptake is moderately compensated this finding supports the hypotheses of roupsard et al 1999 roupsard et al 2022 about the phreatophytic behaviour of faidherbia in particular results from the calibration procedure indicate that roots are able to meet the transpiration demand by extracting more soil water via the less stressed part of the roots until ωc reaches a value between approximately 0 31 and 0 48 at that point the roots as a whole start to experience some stress deb et al 2013 used a similar value of ωc to simulate the compensated root water uptake of a pecan tree in another study wang et al 2022 showed how a ωc value between 0 3 and 0 7 led to optimal results when simulating transpiration dynamics of the phreatophyte tamarix ramosissima the estimated pressure head at which the root water uptake is reduced by 50 h 50 is relatively low in absolute value it ranges from 140 1 to 54 5 cm similar values were used by yin et al 2018 to simulate transpiration patterns in the phreatophyte salix matsudana our h 50 values together with the estimated value of the shape parameter p suggest that the model treats the uptake reduction as essentially a step function under moderately wet conditions the actual and potential transpiration are close according to the model but they will diverge as the pressure head increases in absolute value and soil pores desaturate skaggs et al 2006a this prediction is physically realistic for sandy soils zhu et al 2009 like the one investigated in the present study it must be emphasized that because this study presents the first detailed simulation to our knowledge of faidherbia s phreatophytic behaviour it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between our estimated root water uptake parameters and those from other existing studies on faidherbia however comparisons with the existing literature on other phreatophytes as well as the discussion about the physical meaning of the root water uptake parameters suggest that the model provides a good approximation of faidherbia s macroscopic behaviour of and its influence upon water fluxes in the vadose zone 3 1 4 model validation to validate the high fidelity 2d axisymmetric hydrus 2d model we propagated into it the parameters estimated posterior distributions table 1 fig 7 shows a comparison between the model predictive uncertainty bands blue and green areas the mean posterior solution solid lines and measured values grey circles of sap flow sa and volumetric water contents θ at eight different depths the model predictive performance generally remained satisfactory but the bias was greater than during the calibration period this observation is confirmed by the rmse values that were calculated for the mean solution from the parameters posterior distributions those values now range between 0 014 and 0 021 cm3 cm 3 for the volumetric water content and reach 0 019 cm day 1 for the sap flow while the model approximates water distribution well in the upper soil horizons the deviation between model predictions and measurements is greater for deeper soil layers in particular the model seems to systematically anticipate the arrival of the moisture front for z 100 cm while still reproducing the peak timing and soil drying well for 100 cm z 200 cm this result suggests an imperfect modelling of the soil wetting process a deficiency that can be partially explained by the higher frequency of soil drying data in the calibration dataset fig 6 nor is it possible to rule out possible effects of soil heterogeneity macropore flow and measurement inaccuracies more evident is the model s overestimation of the sap flow compared to during the calibration phase although the transpiration pattern is again well reproduced the fitting could probably have been improved through a different apportioning of computation time between the calibration and validation periods e g by extending the calibration and shortening the validation as well by making the model more detailed e g increasing the soil layering however greater detail would have increased the computational cost of the analysis by increasing both the dimensionality of the inverse problem and the complexity of the multifidelity surrogate training overall results from the validation phase do not provide grounds for rejecting the model instead the model s predictive performance remains satisfactory for the purpose of the analysis which is to understand water fluxes in the vadose zone below faidherbia trees 3 1 5 hydrological interpretation of water fluxes the interpretations that follow are based upon results from the validated high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model using the parameters estimated posterior distributions 3 1 6 partitioning of the water fluxes a study of fig 8 shows that the model predictive uncertainty is low except for the actual transpiration of faidherbia sa tree and the groundwater recharge r the uncertainty of these parameter is attributable to the relatively high uncertainties of the root parameters themselves the predicted daily actual evaporation fluxes ea are low during the december to june dry seasons mean 6 6 0 4 104 cm3 d 1 these ea values are representative of second stage evaporation during which high pressure heads at the surface limit the upward water fluxes conversely the model predicts higher ea values during the wet seasons as expected because of the moister soil conditions specifically the average predicted ea for the wet season is 5 32 1 0 105 cm3 d 1 and the maximum which occurs during rainy days is 1 55 0 7 106 cm3 d 1 a in fig 8 wet seasons are also the times when local farmers practice the rainfed rotation of groundnut as they did in 2019 and 2021 and pearl millet in 2020 the simulated daily actual transpiration of those crops sa crop ranges from 5 7 0 0 103 to 8 2 1 7 104 cm3 d 1 in the early growing stage late july early august versus 1 72 0 0 104 to 5 4 0 02 105 cm3 d 1 during the vegetative stage september predicted values of sa crop are higher under groundnut max 4 95 0 45 105 cm3 d 1 mean 0 52 0 03 105 cm3 d 1 than under pearl millet max 3 58 0 01 105 cm3 d 1 mean 0 37 0 08 105 cm3 d 1 this outcome is the result of groundnut s higher lai the partitionings of ea and sa crop as derived from the high fidelity 2d model are similar to those which diongue et al 2022b computed via hydrus 1d for location at the study area that are outside of the trees radius of influence i e 30 m away from any tree the predicted seasonal variations of faidherbia s actual transpiration sa tree are opposite to those of the crops as is consistent with the species reverse phenology faidherbia s predicted flux becomes negligible during the rainy season but increases after the onset of leafing specifically faidherbia s predicted flux is around 1 48 0 56 102 cm3 d 1 in late september and early october and the maximums mean 5 17 3 75 104 cm3 d 1 occur during january february interestingly the onset of leafing of this phreatophyte species is paced with the groundwater recharge rate r roupsard et al 2022 which varies from 0 44 0 15 106 cm3 d 1 in 2021 to 1 14 0 01 106 cm3 d 1 in 2019 c and d in fig 8 the model predicts that at the annual scale ea is the main component of the water balance ranging from 8 4 2 6 107 cm3 y 1 in 2019 52 3 16 4 of the year s total precipitation p to 11 1 2 4 107 cm3 y 1 in 2020 58 7 13 of p the second largest component is r which varied between 3 7 2 7 107 cm3 y 1 in 2021 24 4 17 6 of p and 5 1 1 1 107 cm3 y 1 in 2019 31 3 7 1 of p d in fig 10 the fluxes sa crop and sa tree are the smallest components sa crop ranged from 1 3 0 1 107 cm3 y 1 7 8 0 7 of p in 2019 to 2 6 0 1 107 cm3 y 1 17 2 1 0 of p in 2021 sa tree was even smaller 8 8 7 2 106 to 1 2 0 7 107 cm3 y 1 corresponding to 5 5 4 5 to 7 7 4 9 of p groundwater recharge rates r predicted by the high fidelity axisymmetric hydrus 2d model are higher than those which have been reported for other semiarid regions e g boumaiza et al 2021 gaj et al 2016 koeniger et al 2016 skrzypek et al 2019 the predicted rates are also higher than those calculated for senegal s groundnut basin by researchers who used unsaturated zone approaches e g profiles of chloride deuterium and tritium in soil water for example edmunds and gaye 1994 gaye and edmunds 1996 who studied chloride profiles at 15 separate sites and tritium profiles at two sites showed that r averaged 5 of p in northern senegal s louga region where the annual precipitation is around 290 mm y 1 similarly diongue et al 2022a found that the average r in the groundnut basin during 2021 was less than 2 of p based upon stable isotope profiles of bulk soil water to understand why the r values predicted by the model are higher than those from unsaturated zone approaches it is important to note that the latter approach postulates that none of the recharge occurs via localized focused paths such as tree induced macropores instead the unsaturated zone approach assumes that all of the recharge occurs diffusely from soil water that percolates through the vadose zone matrix by advection dominated flow therefore the model s high r values highlight the potential impact of faidherbia roots in generating paths for localized recharge bargués tobella et al 2014 ilstedt et al 2016 this impact is consistent with results reported recently by bargués tobella et al 2020 these authors who assessed deep drainage in the openings among trees report that deep drainage in smaller openings where the soil is more likely to contain root induced macropores is 10 times higher than in openings whose centres are 22 m distant from the nearest tree trunk thus bargués tobella et al 2020 highlight the decisive role that tree cover plays in promoting recharge by increasing macropore flow and deep percolation especially near the tree trunk 3 1 7 effect of root adaptability upon the water budget to further investigate the influence of root adaptability factors ωc upon the water budget the validated high fidelity 2d model was used to calculate and compare sa crop sa tree and r under conditions in which faidherbia s root water uptake rwu was variously compensated ωc 0 39 a value that is based upon calibration results and used as baseline fully compensated ωc 0 01 and uncompensated ωc 1 0 the tree s cumulative transpiration the line labelled sa tree in fig 9 is significantly influenced by ωc with values ranging from 1 03 107 cm3 in uncompensated conditions to 2 60 107 cm3 for compensated rwu transpiration remains high 4 58 107 cm3 and similar to potential rates in fully compensated condition resulting in increases of 43 2 and 77 6 compared to compensated and uncompensated root water uptake respectively this large increase is due to the low water holding capacity of sandy soils such as the one investigated in the present study some authors have reported that the enhanced compensated uptake occurs after significant water depletion or after distribution of water stress over the soil profile deb et al 2013 šimůnek hopmans 2009 for example deb et al 2013 reported that the compensated rwu of pecan trees increased by only 8 compared to the uncompensated rwu the small magnitude of that increase was attributed to the water holding capacity of the orchard s silty clay loam soil still the increase was sufficient to avoid severe water stress during the growing season in the present study the compensated rwu had no significant impact upon the crop s cumulative transpiration sa crop in fig 9 which decreased by only 0 2 under fully compensated condition this result is due to faidherbia s reverse phenology because of which the tree competes very little for water with adjacent crops conversely increased rwu by faidherbia in the fully compensated condition results in lower groundwater recharge rates with the cumulative value decreasing by 12 7 and 24 7 respectively compared to uncompensated and compensated rwu this result suggests that root water uptake has an appreciable but moderate effect upon recharge fluxes at the same time faidherbia can alter and potentially increase recharge fluxes through root induce changes in the soil s hydraulic behaviour 3 1 8 spatial distribution of the root water uptake to gain further insight into the strategies that faidherbia employs to mitigate water stress the validated model was used to investigate how the root adaptability factor ωc affects spatial rwu patterns at two times of the year during october when faidherbia begins its leafing at the end of the cropping season and in february the time of maximum leaf density and therefore peak transpiration demand the 2d contour plots in fig 10 show that during both periods the compensated and uncompensated root uptakes from trees rwu tree vary not only with soil depth but also with radial distance from the tree trunk the model s output also shows that in early october 6 10 2020 when pearl millet crop is in its maturity stage then harvested a few days later ωc does not affect root uptake from crops rwu crop at that time rwu crop averages 9 28 10 4 cm3 cm 3 d 1 according to results from the model the amount of water extracted by pearl millet follows the millet s assumed root length distribution specifically rwu crop is a function of depth exclusively at any given depth it is the same at all distances from the tree except within a few cm of the trunk moreover rwu crop is highest at the surface and decreases linearly with depth during the same period early october 6 10 2020 faidherbia s transpiration demand is low and the soil is still relatively wet due to ongoing redistribution of preceding rainfall infiltration faidherbia roots do not experience severe water stress at this time but extract water at higher rates in the deep layers especially outside of the dripline area this result is consistent with faidherbia s root length distribution which is denser outside the tree canopy the rwu tree rates are minimal near the tree trunk and in the upper soil layer but increase gradually with depth from 100 cm downward the highest values occur within the 350 450 cm soil layer at radial distances 300 cm the rates decrease again in the capillary fringe the magnitude and pattern of rwu tree rates for compensated uptake mean 1 99 10 7 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and uncompensated uptake 0 77 10 7 cm3 cm 3 d 1 vary slightly during early october particularly with soil depth a and b in fig 10 indeed to compensate the water stress roots extract water at higher rates in the deep layers thanks to the combined effect of 1 higher root density and 2 wetter soil and lower pressure head gradient compared to the shallow layer the spatial pattern of rwu tree in february differs substantially from october s due to soil drying which is induced by the limited holding capacity of the sandy media and the higher transpiration demand of faidherbia in addition roots experience more water stress in february than during october and the magnitudes of rwutree are higher the mean compensated rwu is 2 98 10 5 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and the mean uncompensated rwu is 1 17 10 5 cm3 cm 3 d 1 hence the depth distribution of rwu tree is driven not only by the most densely rooted soil layers but also by the soil water conditions these hydrological behaviours of faidherbia confirm its suitability for sahelian agroforestry because of its reverse phenology faidherbia extracts comparatively little water throughout the cropping season making this tree only a minor competing species for water with the adjacent crops note that ωc has no significant effect upon rwucrop furthermore the study area s low density stands of faidherbia consume less than 10 of p and use deep water to mitigate water stress 4 summary and conclusions the main goal of this study was to provide further insights into the hydrological impact of faidherbia in arid areas by combining diverse experimental data and mechanistic modelling to overcome the computational bottleneck a multifidelity surrogate based approach was adopted the proposed surrogate merges a one dimensional low fidelity description of the vadose zone beneath faidherbia hydrus 1d with a kriging based correction function to emulate the response of a high fidelity two dimensional axisymmetric representation of the domain hydrus 2d after training and validation a probabilistic framework based upon bayesian inference is used to calibrate the surrogate and to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters the comparison between model predictions and observations confirms the good predictive accuracy and limited predictive uncertainty of the model during calibration as well as validation and thus supports the use of multifidelity surrogates as an efficient tool for reducing the computational cost of calibrating mechanistic models the values of the surrogate based estimated soil hydraulic and root water uptake parameters suggest that faidherbia induces changes in the soil hydraulic properties these values also confirm the phreatophytic behaviour of faidherbia in particular the high values calculated for the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks in all soil horizons support the existence of macropore related and or root induced preferential flow which increases recharge rates significantly this finding has been reported in other studies but should be further investigated by performing comprehensive measurements of the root distribution and morphology combined with tracer experiments to provide more informative data for calibrating models these data would make possible a robust comparison via bayesian modelling in which the current unimodal richards based description of the water flow is tested against dual domain or gravity driven formulations that better describe preferential and macropore flow by identifying the most appropriate model structure such a comparison might confirm and assess the magnitude of these root induced fast flows thus further strengthening the findings of the present study which indicates that of faidherbia has a net positive effect upon the hydrological balance of arid areas these detailed mechanistic analyses should be theoretically complemented by a watershed hydrological modelling to have a broader understanding of water fluxes in the agroforestry parkland credit authorship contribution statement djim m l diongue conceptualization writing original draft investigation giuseppe

1792,the need to combine simple analytical solutions to control the full spectrum of stochastic events not just extreme rainfall events related to flood risk in order to restore the natural water cycle has led to the adoption of probability analysis pa as a powerful design tool for urban drainage systems applications of pa to sustainable urban drainage and nature based solution nbs design are

shape of nbss to fit into an existing urban grid and 2 the intensity of rainfall which is expected to increase significantly the bm approach is insensitive to the shape of technical solutions and the variability of rainfall intensity so the pa was revised coupled with a hydrodynamic modelling hm approach and compared with previous bm based approaches in the low intensity rainfall regime hm and bm predict completely different infiltration system is overflow probabilities in the high intensity precipitation regime both provide a bell shaped probability density function of overflow volumes

challenge the new sustainable and multi tasking drainage system adams and howard 1986 with reference to the multiple nbs s tasks restoring the paths of the natural water cycle in urban environments and retuning water to subsurface water bodies therefore reducing drainage system discharge and hydraulic risk of flood there is a limited capacity in the design phase zuniga terran et al 2020 and uncertainty about how to design nbs often envisioning participatory approaches campbell et al 2016 efficiency of nature based solutions has not a unified definition due to their multiple intended function spraakman et al 2020 as evidenced by adams and papa 2000 it is furthermore impossible to assign a unique frequency to a natural rain event which possess many characteristics intensity volume duration and these characteristics all influence the performance of nbs which are designed to fulfil a multiplicity of scopes changes in extreme as well as in non extreme precipitation events may impact infrastructures cook et al 2018 2019 therefore nbs s performance could be most profitably evaluated by statistical analysis of their response to the whole spectrum of yearly precipitation events probability analysis pa adams and papa 2000 addresses the overall performance of detention and retention structures most of the applications of pa to detention and retention structures focusses on their storage capacity and on the fact that previous rain events may affect the capacity and reduce the efficiency of nbs when the inter events time is shorter than the dry out time pa was applied to emphasize the connection between excess rainfall and soil storage capacity of urban catchments guo and adams 1998 li and adams 2000 hassini and guo 2022 permeable pavements zhang and guo 2015 and

attributes of rain and demonstrates that referring to a single design rainfall may compromise the evaluation of nbs s however most applications of the pa to is efficiency assessment use a stochastic process based on the arrival of events with random volume at random dry time intervals processes in which the random duration of the precipitation event is not generated do not allow for the evaluation of the significance of rainfall intensity in the hydrological process of rainfall runoff transformation aspects of is performance related to hydrological processes gain relevance with changing shape piazza and ursino 2022 stochastic models for rainfall generation coupled to bucket modelling bm considers only two attributes of attributes of rain stochastic rain depth and interevent time wang and guo 2020 demonstrated the relevance of the effective storage capacity of infiltration trenches within the framework of pa by bm they developed their pa analysis by using average rain depth obtained with an interevent time definition of several hours neglecting intensity of short rain events consistently with the bm approach rainfall is instantaneously transformed into incoming volume the trench was assimilated to a bucket therefore rainfall duration and intensity were not considered we suggest here to revise pa analysis replacing bm with hydrodynamic modelling hm therefore considering stochastic rain intensity volume and interevent the use of hm coupled to an intensity volume interevent stochastic model for rain allows intensity and shape dependent evaluation of is s efficiency as discussed in the following stochastic models based on rainfall depth only based on a bucket modelling bm approach are appropriate to capture the performance of storage elements a hydrologic modelling hm approach rossman 2010 overcomes the limits of bucket models for infiltration systems iss and shows that iss are sensitive to events with high intensity or events with relevant rain volume depending on shape piazza and ursino 2022 following a hm approach piazza and ursino 2022 overflow occurs when water running of the impervious drainage sub catchment ponds over the trench exceeding the maximum ponding depth rain intensity and duration as well as the shape of the is its maximum detention capacity and infiltration capacity determine the overflow volume by considering the dynamic of rainfall runoff transformation in addition to the storage capacity of is hm demonstrates that long narrow is located along impervious surfaces with predominant development in the direction transverse to the runoff flow are less efficient from a circular economy perspective oral et al 2021 but effective in drainage and fast linear disposal rain intensity ad is s shape did not yet receive attention within the framework of pa in order to address si performance by a hm approach sub daily rainfall should be considered lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 whereas daily rainfall records are easily available sub daily rainfall statistics are not always available therefore e g islam et al 2022 utilized satellite derived and daily gauge data to obtain idf curves with sub daily intervals which show that hourly and daily precipitation intensity with several return times exceed hourly precipitation by an order of magnitude harp and horton 2022 observed a shift from lower to higher daily precipitation intensities over central and eastern united states sub daily extreme events are expected to increase much more than extreme daily prein et al 2017 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 westra et al 2014 the topic of revising pa with special focus on intensity of short rail events is relevant to correctly assess the performance of nbs within the urban setup and in view of possible climate change scenarios as well the research circumscribes the limits of applicability of well known pa s analytical solutions based on the widespread bm approach wang and guo 2020 introduces the dynamic hm approach within the framework f pa piazza and ursino 2022 and extends pa based risk analysis to scenarios where climate or urban constraint may affect is performance 2 methods 2 1 is model the schematic representation of an infiltration system is comprehending an impervious drainage surface a pervious infiltration area and a trench below it is represented in fig 1 where q out s is runoff generated over the surface s q in is flow diverted to the subsurface trench q inf is deep percolation and q out is overflow discharge rainfall falls over the whole system drainage surface and infiltration area flows over the drainage surface where drainage is described by manning equation and reaches the infiltration area where ponding may eventually take place up to a maximum ponding depth when the water depth over the infiltration area exceeds the maximum ponding level overflow discharge is diverted to the drainage system water infiltrates toward the deeper soil layers through the engineered soil of an infiltration trench below the previous area infiltration is described by green ampt equation the ratio between the infiltration volume which infiltrates and the rainfall volume determines the efficiency of the is conversely the ration between the overflow volume and rainfall volume is an index of the trench inefficiency and risk of failure the hydrodynamic behaviour of the infiltration system which comprehend the pervious trench and the impervious drainage sub catchment is described by a set of mass balance equations providing as a function of time the water depth over the impervious area and over the trench as well as the soil moisture within the engineered soil of the trench see piazza and ursino 2022 for model details the theoretical approach resembles the one implemented in the lid module of swmm the balance equations were implemented in matlab 2010 in order to couple them with a monte carlo rainfall generator and elaborate statistically the results within the same code 2 2 hydrologic model hm in the hydrodynamic modelling hm approach y s y are the water depth over the impervious sub catchment over the trench respectively z h soil is the

rainfall depth h duration d and interarrival times τ follow exponential distributions 13 p h ζ e ζ h 14 p d η e η d 15 p τ λ e λ τ parameters 1 ζ 1 η and 1 λ are the average rainfall depth duration and interarrival respectively pa derives the probability of failure of a hydrologic system from the probability functions of rainfall characteristics by means of simple hydrologic functions linking parameter of performance to rainfall characteristics and design variable a typical example of application of pa to storage systems is provided by the simple water balance according to a bucket modelling approach overflow occurs when the runoff volume hs exceedes the capacity of the trench m i n τ f b l n h b l when no simple relation is available to link performance parameters to rainfall characteristics a statistically significative number of rain events over many rainy seasons may be used for the simulation of the is behaviour and the evaluation of the overflow frequency according to a monte carlo procedure the hydraulic risk associated with a given rain volume is defined in any case as the probability that rain events with that volume cause an overflow it depends on the initial conditions of the is on the frequency of the event itself rare rain events rarely occur and rarely cause overflow 3 results 3 1 shape and risk of failure in the following case study the frequency of failure of nbs is estimated via monte carlo approach the probability of failure of nbs is an estimate of nbs s risk of failure and is assimilated to the simulated frequency of overflow probability analysis pa and bucket modelling bm demonstrated the risk of insufficient storage capacity of is under exponentially distributed random rainfall in order to quantify the relevance of hydrologic processes such as runoff production and infiltration other than storage of rain volume pa and hydrologic modelling hm have been coupled hm provides an estimate of risk and efficiency which unlike bm is sensitive to is s shape and rain intensity piazza and ursino 2022 the case study proposed by wang and guo 2020 who evaluated is s efficiency based on a bm approach is re examined here with special focus on is s shape design parameters and the average rain attributes are reported in table 1 rainfall parameters represent jackson mississippi us with a humid climate rainfall regime according to wang and guo 2020 rain events have been generated in order to simulate the performance of the is over 1000 years at the end of each rainy season the total runoff infiltration and overflow volumes relative to total rainfall volume have been estimated the overflow volume which cannot be infiltrated represents the is inefficiency in a circular economy perspective efficiency is the ability of an is to return to ground water runoff and overflow represents the system failure the performance of two iss with different shape is evaluated by pa and hm namely shape factors are rs 8 and rs 0 125 where rs b l the ratio between the length and width of the trench bm is insensitive to shape changes therefore average volumes are evaluated once only table 2 reports average values of rain volume infiltration and overflow volume estimated at the end of every rainy season of the whole simulation time statistics of dimensionless yearly overflow volume overflow volume divided by rain volume of any rain events are reported in table 3 the histograms of the yearly ratio between overflow and rainfall volume estimated by bm purple and hm blue are plotted in figs 2 and 3 for two different shape factors rs 0 125 fig 2 and rs 8 fig 3 coupled pa and bm highlight the relevance of the dry spell duration to ensure that storage capacity is repristinated during dry spell although the draw down during dry spell has minor influence on trench reliability when rain intensity is very low as in the case of jackson mississippi us wang and guo 2020 discussed here when the intensity of rainfall is low the rate of rainfall volume production is comparable to the rate of deep infiltration therefore the available storage volume is repristinated during rain event figs 2 and 3 show that in a low intensity rainfall regime bm may overestimate trench efficiency shape factor has minor effect on hm prediction according to hm overflow volume decreases with increasing shape factor and are much larger than those estimated by bm according to the bm approach rainfall volume production infiltration and exfiltration occur at the same time according to the hm exfiltration begins when the infiltrating front reaches the bottom of the trench when the runoff volume is estimated as the difference between available trench storage volume and rainfall volume following a bm approach it reflects the random characteristics of the generated rain events and is is s shape invariant by the use of hm infiltration ponding and overflow are affected by the rainfall runoff transformation process and by the infiltration process and therefore they depend upon the shape of the is 3 2 rain intensity and risk of failure in order to address the effect of rain intensity on efficiency of trenches with different shape data collected in a different climate zone are statistically analysed the data used are the rainfall at 5 minute intervals recorded at the teolo meteorological station italy recorded in the period from 01 january 1993 to 31 october 2022 arpa veneto personal communication rain separated by a dry interval of at least six hours are considered to be independent rain events statistics of rain attributes to be used within the framework of pa are reported in table 4 together with is s design parameters with respect to the previous example table 1 the surface s of the drainage sub catchment differs from the surface s adopted in the previous case study to ensure that the average rainfall volumes produced over the surface s in the previous case study low intensity rainfall and averaged volumes produced over s are the same therefore s s h h 1 average rain intensity h is to 9 26 mm hr whereas in the case study discussed in the previous section the average rain depth was h 1 92 mm hr the rainy season is 5 months therefore 2400 years are simulated for statistical significance table 5 shows the average values of rainfall volume infiltration and overflow volume estimated at the end of every rainy season of the entire simulation time the average dimensionless overflow volumes and their standard deviation are shown in table 6 figs 4 and 5 show histograms of the annual ratio between overflow and rainfall volume estimated by bucket modelling purple and hm blue for two different form factors rs 0 125 fig 4 and rs 8 fig 5 both bm and hm approach evidence the loss of efficiency of is under more intense rainfall regime bm forecast is unaffected by shape factor and it appears to overestimate efficiency when the shape factor is lower and underestimate efficiency when the shape factor is increased in order to appreciate the frequency of occurrence of overflow the cumulated probability functions of normalized overflow volume are shown in figs 6 and 7 the curves for moderate intensity rainfall patterns rainfall measured in jackson are shown in fig 6 the curves for rainfall data with higher intensity rainfall measured in teolo are shown in fig 7 the curve called rain represents the cumulative probability that the volume of rainfall exceeds the trench storage capacity hs b l h n divided by the rainfall volume hs it represents the cumulate of the overflow in the absence of exfiltration estimated assuming that the trench may have storage capacity only within the framework of pa daily rainfalls are generated to simulate is performance therefore we cannot refer to the return time see e g volpi 2019 of a design rainfall which would be between 1 and 2 years in the cases examined here probability of exceedance of detention volume rain curve in figs 6 and 7 is the most appropriate index to the characterization of a design rain in this context to comment figs 6 and 7 the probability that the overflow volume is less than or equal than half the precipitation volume hs 1 5 n b l h is extrapolated by each curve corresponding to different modelling assumptions fig 6 shows that bm hm rs 0 125 and hm rs 8 provide estimates of the probability equal to 0 99 0 75 rs 8 and 0 6 rs 0 125 all exceeding the probability that the rainfall volume is less than or equal to 1 5 n b l h which is 0 41 deep infiltration through the trench plays a key role in the operation of the system under low rainfall conditions bm overestimates the infiltration volume and trenches stretched in the direction of water motion are more efficient than wide trenches based on what is predicted by hm fig 7 represents the cumulative probability calculated based on the processing of rainfall recorded in teolo and characterized by higher intensity the curve rain and bm provide a very similar estimate of the probability that the overflow volume is less than half the rainfall volume namely 0 52 bm and 0 54 rain the results obtained with hm highlight the importance of trench shape for rs 0 125 the probability that overflow volume is less than half the rain volume is 0 28 and for rs 8 the is 0 78 the best filtration efficiency in a trench elongated in the direction of flow rs 8 in agreement with piazza and ursino 2022 4 discussion and conclusion similar to previous studies based on probability analysis pa the new approach proposed here provides an estimate of efficiency of infiltration systems iss previous solutions based on pa are not sensitive to variability of random rain intensity and is s shape which are critical design constraint in climate and urban growth scenarios whereas the hydrologic modelling hm approach coupled with pa may capture their influence on is s efficiency and probability of failure the rainfall generator is kept as simple as in previous literature contributions and the interdependency of rain attributes as well as non stationarity although relevant are not discussed here instead the focus on rain intensity and the hydrologic modelling hm approach allowed a critical revision of the design criterium based on storage capacity only of iss such as trenches the necessity to consider subsequent rain events guo and adams 1998 li and adams 2000 hassini and guo 2022 and therefore an aleatory initial condition of iss guo and gao 2016 was demonstrated by pa analysis adams and papa 2000 although revisiting pa by considering that rainfall intensity is a random variable independent from rainfall volume evidences that the processes of runoff production and infiltration may overturn prediction of pa based on bucket modelling bm wang and guo 2020 as rainfall intensity changes newly developed pa based on hm may be more appropriate to evaluate efficiency of is especially in view of possible climate change scenarios where rain intensity is expected to increase exacerbating the rainwater management kendon et al 2014 westra et al 2014 urban growth maheshwari et al 2020 the need to contrast the impact of urbanization on water drainage and sustainable management miller et al 2014 the population expectancies winker et al 2022 highlight the need to set up instruments to evaluate design of infrastructures to be encapsulated in an already defined urban tissue evidencing the need to evaluate whether shape of is and other nbs space constraint possible architecture of drainage and is may affect the performance of new green and blue complements to already existing grey infrastructures coupled pa and hm may be such instrument evidences provided by the results may be summarized as follows under low intensity rainfall regime major differences arise between the probability of overflow estimated based on bm and the one estimated based on hm the shapes of the probability density functions of overflow volume evaluated with bm and hm coupled with pa are quite different in the low intensity regime the probability of overflow estimated by coupled pa and bm resembles the exponential shape which characterize rainfall characteristics and underestimates the probability of large overflow volume the probability of overflow estimated by use of hm appears completely different with a bell shape which does not bear the signature of the rainfall characteristic distribution but rather the effect of hydrologic processes transforming rainfall into runoff and infiltration volumes in the high intensity rainfall regime both hm and bm provide bell shape probability density function of overflow volumes although bm tends to underestimate overflow volumes of is with low shape factor and to overestimate overflow volumes of is with high shape factor i e trenches with main development in the direction of flow routing is shape affects model dependent efficiency

depth obtained with an interevent time definition of several hours neglecting intensity of short rain events consistently with the bm approach rainfall is instantaneously transformed into incoming volume the trench was assimilated to a bucket therefore rainfall duration and intensity were not considered we suggest here to revise pa analysis replacing bm with hydrodynamic modelling hm therefore considering stochastic rain intensity volume and interevent the use of hm coupled to an intensity volume interevent stochastic model for rain allows intensity and shape dependent evaluation of is s efficiency as discussed in the following stochastic models based on rainfall depth only based on a bucket modelling bm approach are appropriate to capture the performance of storage elements a hydrologic modelling hm approach rossman 2010 overcomes the limits of bucket models for infiltration systems iss and shows that iss are sensitive to events with high intensity or events with relevant rain volume depending on shape piazza and ursino 2022 following a hm approach piazza and ursino 2022 overflow occurs when water running of the impervious drainage sub catchment ponds over the trench exceeding the maximum ponding depth rain intensity and duration as well as the shape of the is its maximum detention capacity and infiltration capacity determine the overflow volume by considering the dynamic of rainfall runoff transformation in addition to the storage capacity of is hm demonstrates that long narrow is located along impervious surfaces with predominant development in the direction transverse to the runoff flow are less efficient from a circular economy perspective oral et al 2021 but effective in drainage and fast linear disposal rain intensity ad is s shape did not yet receive attention within the framework of pa in order to address si performance by a hm approach sub daily rainfall should be considered lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 whereas daily rainfall records are easily available sub daily rainfall statistics are not always available therefore e g islam et al 2022 utilized satellite derived and daily gauge data to obtain idf curves with sub daily intervals which show that hourly and daily precipitation intensity with several return times exceed hourly precipitation by an order of magnitude harp and horton 2022 observed a shift from lower to higher daily precipitation intensities over central and eastern united states sub daily extreme events are expected to increase much more than extreme daily prein et al 2017 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 westra et al 2014 the topic of revising pa with special focus on intensity of short rail events is relevant to correctly assess the performance of nbs within the urban setup and in view of possible climate change scenarios as well the research circumscribes the limits of applicability of well known pa s analytical solutions based on the widespread bm approach wang and guo 2020 introduces the dynamic hm approach within the framework f pa piazza and ursino 2022 and extends pa based risk analysis to scenarios where climate or urban constraint may affect is performance 2 methods 2 1 is model the schematic representation of an infiltration system is comprehending an impervious drainage surface a pervious infiltration area and a trench below it is represented in fig 1 where q out s is runoff generated over the surface s q in is flow diverted to the subsurface trench q inf is deep percolation and q out is overflow discharge rainfall falls over the whole system drainage surface and infiltration area flows over the drainage surface where drainage is described by manning equation and reaches the infiltration area where ponding may eventually take place up to a maximum ponding depth when the water depth over the infiltration area exceeds the maximum ponding level overflow discharge is diverted to the drainage system water infiltrates toward the deeper soil layers through the engineered soil of an infiltration trench below the previous area infiltration is described by green ampt equation the ratio between the infiltration volume which infiltrates and the rainfall volume determines the efficiency of the is conversely the ration between the overflow volume and rainfall volume is an index of the trench inefficiency and risk of failure the hydrodynamic behaviour of the infiltration system which comprehend the pervious trench and the impervious drainage sub catchment is described by a set of mass balance equations providing as a function of time the water depth over the impervious area and over the trench as well as the soil moisture within the engineered soil of the trench see piazza and ursino 2022 for model details the theoretical approach resembles the one implemented in the lid module of swmm the balance equations were implemented in matlab 2010 in order to couple them with a monte carlo rainfall generator and elaborate statistically the results within the same code 2 2 hydrologic model hm in the hydrodynamic modelling hm approach y s y are the water depth over the impervious sub catchment over the trench respectively z h soil is the

rainfall depth h duration d and interarrival times τ follow exponential distributions 13 p h ζ e ζ h 14 p d η e η d 15 p τ λ e λ τ parameters 1 ζ 1 η and 1 λ are the average rainfall depth duration and interarrival respectively pa derives the probability of failure of a hydrologic system from the probability functions of rainfall characteristics by means of simple hydrologic functions linking parameter of performance to rainfall characteristics and design variable a typical example of application of pa to storage systems is provided by the simple water balance according to a bucket modelling approach overflow occurs when the runoff volume hs exceedes the capacity of the trench m i n τ f b l n h b l when no simple relation is available to link performance parameters to rainfall characteristics a statistically significative number of rain events over many rainy seasons may be used for the simulation of the is behaviour and the evaluation of the overflow frequency according to a monte carlo procedure the hydraulic risk associated with a given rain volume is defined in any case as the probability that rain events with that volume cause an overflow it depends on the initial conditions of the is on the frequency of the event itself rare rain events rarely occur and rarely cause overflow 3 results 3 1 shape and risk of failure in the following case study the frequency of failure of nbs is estimated via monte carlo approach the probability of failure of nbs is an estimate of nbs s risk of failure and is assimilated to the simulated frequency of overflow probability analysis pa and bucket modelling bm demonstrated the risk of insufficient storage capacity of is under exponentially distributed random rainfall in order to quantify the relevance of hydrologic processes such as runoff production and infiltration other than storage of rain volume pa and hydrologic modelling hm have been coupled hm provides an estimate of risk and efficiency which unlike bm is sensitive to is s shape and rain intensity piazza and ursino 2022 the case study proposed by wang and guo 2020 who evaluated is s efficiency based on a bm approach is re examined here with special focus on is s shape design parameters and the average rain attributes are reported in table 1 rainfall parameters represent jackson mississippi us with a humid climate rainfall regime according to wang and guo 2020 rain events have been generated in order to simulate the performance of the is over 1000 years at the end of each rainy season the total runoff infiltration and overflow volumes relative to total rainfall volume have been estimated the overflow volume which cannot be infiltrated represents the is inefficiency in a circular economy perspective efficiency is the ability of an is to return to ground water runoff and overflow represents the system failure the performance of two iss with different shape is evaluated by pa and hm namely shape factors are rs 8 and rs 0 125 where rs b l the ratio between the length and width of the trench bm is insensitive to shape changes therefore average volumes are evaluated once only table 2 reports average values of rain volume infiltration and overflow volume estimated at the end of every rainy season of the whole simulation time statistics of dimensionless yearly overflow volume overflow volume divided by rain volume of any rain events are reported in table 3 the histograms of the yearly ratio between overflow and rainfall volume estimated by bm purple and hm blue are plotted in figs 2 and 3 for two different shape factors rs 0 125 fig 2 and rs 8 fig 3 coupled pa and bm highlight the relevance of the dry spell duration to ensure that storage capacity is repristinated during dry spell although the draw down during dry spell has minor influence on trench reliability when rain intensity is very low as in the case of jackson mississippi us wang and guo 2020 discussed here when the intensity of rainfall is low the rate of rainfall volume production is comparable to the rate of deep infiltration therefore the available storage volume is repristinated during rain event figs 2 and 3 show that in a low intensity rainfall regime bm may overestimate trench efficiency shape factor has minor effect on hm prediction according to hm overflow volume decreases with increasing shape factor and are much larger than those estimated by bm according to the bm approach rainfall volume production infiltration and exfiltration occur at the same time according to the hm exfiltration begins when the infiltrating front reaches the bottom of the trench when the runoff volume is estimated as the difference between available trench storage volume and rainfall volume following a bm approach it reflects the random characteristics of the generated rain events and is is s shape invariant by the use of hm infiltration ponding and overflow are affected by the rainfall runoff transformation process and by the infiltration process and therefore they depend upon the shape of the is 3 2 rain intensity and risk of failure in order to address the effect of rain intensity on efficiency of trenches with different shape data collected in a different climate zone are statistically analysed the data used are the rainfall at 5 minute intervals recorded at the teolo meteorological station italy recorded in the period from 01 january 1993 to 31 october 2022 arpa veneto personal communication rain separated by a dry interval of at least six hours are considered to be independent rain events statistics of rain attributes to be used within the framework of pa are reported in table 4 together with is s design parameters with respect to the previous example table 1 the surface s of the drainage sub catchment differs from the surface s adopted in the previous case study to ensure that the average rainfall volumes produced over the surface s in the previous case study low intensity rainfall and averaged volumes produced over s are the same therefore s s h h 1 average rain intensity h is to 9 26 mm hr whereas in the case study discussed in the previous section the average rain depth was h 1 92 mm hr the rainy season is 5 months therefore 2400 years are simulated for statistical significance table 5 shows the average values of rainfall volume infiltration and overflow volume estimated at the end of every rainy season of the entire simulation time the average dimensionless overflow volumes and their standard deviation are shown in table 6 figs 4 and 5 show histograms of the annual ratio between overflow and rainfall volume estimated by bucket modelling purple and hm blue for two different form factors rs 0 125 fig 4 and rs 8 fig 5 both bm and hm approach evidence the loss of efficiency of is under more intense rainfall regime bm forecast is unaffected by shape factor and it appears to overestimate efficiency when the shape factor is lower and underestimate efficiency when the shape factor is increased in order to appreciate the frequency of occurrence of overflow the cumulated probability functions of normalized overflow volume are shown in figs 6 and 7 the curves for moderate intensity rainfall patterns rainfall measured in jackson are shown in fig 6 the curves for rainfall data with higher intensity rainfall measured in teolo are shown in fig 7 the curve called rain represents the cumulative probability that the volume of rainfall exceeds the trench storage capacity hs b l h n divided by the rainfall volume hs it represents the cumulate of the overflow in the absence of exfiltration estimated assuming that the trench may have storage capacity only within the framework of pa daily rainfalls are generated to simulate is performance therefore we cannot refer to the return time see e g volpi 2019 of a design rainfall which would be between 1 and 2 years in the cases examined here probability of exceedance of detention volume rain curve in figs 6 and 7 is the most appropriate index to the characterization of a design rain in this context to comment figs 6 and 7 the probability that the overflow volume is less than or equal than half the precipitation volume hs 1 5 n b l h is extrapolated by each curve corresponding to different modelling assumptions fig 6 shows that bm hm rs 0 125 and hm rs 8 provide estimates of the probability equal to 0 99 0 75 rs 8 and 0 6 rs 0 125 all exceeding the probability that the rainfall volume is less than or equal to 1 5 n b l h which is 0 41 deep infiltration through the trench plays a key role in the operation of the system under low rainfall conditions bm overestimates the infiltration volume and trenches stretched in the direction of water motion are more efficient than wide trenches based on what is predicted by hm fig 7 represents the cumulative probability calculated based on the processing of rainfall recorded in teolo and characterized by higher intensity the curve rain and bm provide a very similar estimate of the probability that the overflow volume is less than half the rainfall volume namely 0 52 bm and 0 54 rain the results obtained with hm highlight the importance of trench shape for rs 0 125 the probability that overflow volume is less than half the rain volume is 0 28 and for rs 8 the is 0 78 the best filtration efficiency in a trench elongated in the direction of flow rs 8 in agreement with piazza and ursino 2022 4 discussion and conclusion similar to previous studies based on probability analysis pa the new approach proposed here provides an estimate of efficiency of infiltration systems iss previous solutions based on pa are not sensitive to variability of random rain intensity and is s shape which are critical design constraint in climate and urban growth scenarios whereas the hydrologic modelling hm approach coupled with pa may capture their influence on is s efficiency and probability of failure the rainfall generator is kept as simple as in previous literature contributions and the interdependency of rain attributes as well as non stationarity although relevant are not discussed here instead the focus on rain intensity and the hydrologic modelling hm approach allowed a critical revision of the design criterium based on storage capacity only of iss such as trenches the necessity to consider subsequent rain events guo and adams 1998 li and adams 2000 hassini and guo 2022 and therefore an aleatory initial condition of iss guo and gao 2016 was demonstrated by pa analysis adams and papa 2000 although revisiting pa by considering that rainfall intensity is a random variable independent from rainfall volume evidences that the processes of runoff production and infiltration may overturn prediction of pa based on bucket modelling bm wang and guo 2020 as rainfall intensity changes newly developed pa based on hm may be more appropriate to evaluate efficiency of is especially in view of possible climate change scenarios where rain intensity is expected to increase exacerbating the rainwater management kendon et al 2014 westra et al 2014 urban growth maheshwari et al 2020 the need to contrast the impact of urbanization on water drainage and sustainable management miller et al 2014 the population expectancies winker et al 2022 highlight the need to set up instruments to evaluate design of infrastructures to be encapsulated in an already defined urban tissue evidencing the need to evaluate whether shape of is and other nbs space constraint possible architecture of drainage and is may affect the performance of new green and blue complements to already existing grey infrastructures coupled pa and hm may be such instrument evidences provided by the results may be summarized as follows under low intensity rainfall regime major differences arise between the probability of overflow estimated based on bm and the one estimated based on hm the shapes of the probability density functions of overflow volume evaluated with bm and hm coupled with pa are quite different in the low intensity regime the probability of overflow estimated by coupled pa and bm resembles the exponential shape which characterize rainfall characteristics and underestimates the probability of large overflow volume the probability of overflow estimated by use of hm appears completely different with a bell shape which does not bear the signature of the rainfall characteristic distribution but rather the effect of hydrologic processes transforming rainfall into runoff and infiltration volumes in the high intensity rainfall regime both hm and bm provide bell shape probability density function of overflow volumes although bm tends to underestimate overflow volumes of is with low shape factor and to overestimate overflow volumes of is with high shape factor i e trenches with main development in the direction of flow routing is shape affects model dependent efficiency

1793,upslope drainage area contributing inflow to downslope rill erosion can be affected by the dynamics of eroded sediment and soil surface microtopography however limited information has previously not recognized the variation of the sediment particles and microtopography on hillslopes where upslope inflow perpetually exists a series of scouring flume experiments were performed on a 15 slope under upslope inflow rates 4 6 and 8 l min 1 to investigate the inflow driven microtopography and sediment particle size distribution psd during the rill erosion process the results indicated that the surface elevation decay mostly occurred in the later stage of rill erosion the spatial variability of microtopography increased gradually with increasing inflow rates and obvious microtopography sharpness intensified with the development of rill erosion the surface runoff under the 8 l min 1 inflow rate increased by 15 03 and 90 14 for 6 and 4 l min 1 respectively and the sediment yield reached a maximum at the rill stabilization stage rs the overall particle size distribution was mainly composed of silt sized particles accounting for approximately 40 97 50 15 of the total eroded sediment considerable depletion of clay fractions occurred in the rill erosion process high inflow rate significantly enhanced variation amplitude of critical hydrodynamic parameters e g flow velocity flow shear stress and reynolds number the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography was correlated with the coarser fraction of sediment psd in rill erosion suggesting that erosion processes were affected by the interaction between eroded sediment distribution and roughness these findings highlight the importance of the psd of eroded sediment and the development of soil surface structure for an in depth understanding of the purple soil erosion mechanism at the hillslope scale keywords particle size distribution soil surface microtopography rill erosion upslope sediment laden inflow purple soil data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rill erosion is the dominant sediment source on hillslope scales with favorable conditions for evolving ephemeral and even permanent gully erosion di stefano et al 2017 ou et al 2021 it usually occurs in human disturbed areas especially in sloping farmland where rill erosion induced soil erosion contributes to more than approximately 50 of the total soil loss he et al 2014 rill erosion and subsequent transport of eroded sediment by water flowing into rill channels can have negative effects on soil quality and agricultural production on sloping farmland the rill erosion process mainly includes three subprocesses soil detachment sediment transport by concentrated flow and deposition kimaro et al 2008 these processes tend to be accompanied by a dynamic selectivity of particle and aggregate size asadi et al 2007 2011 shi et al 2012a lin et al 2017 with significant differences in the response of various sediment size characteristics to erosion the change in the particle size distribution psd of eroded sediments may depend on which erosion process is dominant in this regard the sediment size selectivity of rill erosion has been reported wang and shi 2015 thompson et al 2016 and large differences have been found in soil aggregates and primary particles transported by erosive agents of rill flow asadi et al 2007 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2021 previous studies concluded that eroded sediment was enriched in the fractions of clay and silt particles relative to the original soil in both raindrop and overland flow driven induced erosion events and their composition becomes very similar to that of the original soil at the steady overland flow state defersha and melesse 2012 in addition luk et al 1993 found that the soil transported in rill flow is generally dominated by fine particles with small dimensions of the rills however in some cases it has been observed that the sediment size distribution is bimodal during erosion events asadi et al 2007 especially in overland flow induced rill erosion processes zhang et al 2003 shi et al 2012b although great efforts have been made to investigate the size selectivity of eroded sediment during rill erosion processes most of these studies have focused on the effect of the interaction between erosion processes driven by rainfall and overland flow asadi et al 2011 the upslope inflow with certain drainage contributing area is more effective than rainfall at enhancing sediment transport on downslope on the hillslope scale upslope inflow not only has great impacts on runoff and the soil erosion rate li et al 2016 wang et al 2020 but also changes the soil transport capacity of runoff tian et al 2017 xu et al 2017 which may alter flow hydraulics and sediment sorting however the information concerning the effect of upslope inflow on the psd of eroded sediment during rill erosion processes is not available the psd of the eroded sediment with the development of rills is controlled by near surface characteristics and flow hydraulic features lin et al 2017 in an overland flow dominated erosion pattern the surface flow hydraulics will be highly associated with the size distribution of the eroded sediment baigorria and romero 2007 under flow driven erosion at low streampowers asadi et al 2007 found that the mass fractions of different sediment sizes are almost distributed as a bimodal type laboratory studies undertaken by wang and shi 2015 showed that the eroded sediment becomes nonselective after rill flow shear stress exceeds its critical value since there is high dynamic water flow and instability of the boundaries the type of sediment sorting can be changed during the processes of erosion transport and sedimentation han et al 2021 nevertheless there are limited data regarding the sediment psd changes during the rill erosion process separately on hillslopes where upslope inflow perpetually exists soil surface microtopography is one of the important factors controlling runoff generation and sediment transportation bullard et al 2018 and consequently affecting sediment sorting associated with transport mechanisms on slopes chen et al 2013 a previous study was conducted to investigate the impact of soil surface microtopography on interrill erosion processes and the psd of sediment particles under rainfall conditions which observed that the eroded sediment was less selection on smooth than on rough soil surfaces ding and huang 2017 however due to the highly dynamic and random features of the surface microtopography changes in rill erosion processes luo et al 2021 the mechanisms of the microtopography effect on soil erosion are controversial moreover the characteristics of the microtopography dynamic response to runoff were previously neglected a better understanding of the dynamics of the soil surface microtopography will therefore improve the understanding of both erosion and sedimentation processes shi et al 2012a additionally information concerning the sediment distribution and its dynamics with relation to soil surface microtopography is thus required to elucidate the behaviors and interactions of these components that interoperate in the rill erosion process yang and chu 2015 numerous studies have shown that the eroded sediment is primarily effected by both raindrop and runoff on hillslope erosion asadi et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2017 ni et al 2021 the upslope inflow is more prominent than rainfall intensity in increasing the sediment transport capacity of runoff in the water erosion process and causes a more complex redistribution of eroded sediment and flow hydraulics xu et al 2017 however the upslope inflow driven erosion process and the dynamics of sediment sorting on hillslopes have rarely been reported in purple soil hilly region of southwest china upslope inflow is considered to be an important driving force for soil erosion of sloping farmland wang et al 2019 in addition the earthen dike terrace as an engineering measure for conserving soil and water on sloping farmland has almost became the extensive and fragile terrace landscapes as a result of human interventions in this region the stability of terraced fields in recent decades is also threatened by cultivation and rill erosion after rainfall zhou et al 2017 yang et al 2018 a large proportion of earthen dike terraces serving as the upslope drainage area have contributed to the variations in inflow rates and sediment concentrations in the downslope farmland area which led to an increase in rill erosion wang et al 2019 rill erosion is an important linear erosion feature that can be greatly influenced by the interactions between soil surface microtopography and sediment particle size distribution psd ding and huang 2017 although the effect of sediment concentration on the spatial variation in microtopography has been examined under the different upslope drainage areas and inflow conditions in this area luo et al 2021 nevertheless the selection and dynamics of sediment particles associated with soil surface microtopography as well as their potential variation in the erosion process are still not clear under increasing upslope flow driven conditions ascertaining the relationship between sediment dynamics and soil surface microtopography is probably a better indicator for determining how sediment is transported by upslope inflow on hillslopes the aims of the present study were to i characterize the effects of the upslope inflow rate on runoff sediment yield and soil microtopography ii quantify detailed information regarding the particle size distribution of eroded sediment driven by upslope inflow and iii elucidate the hydrodynamic behaviors of inflow and interactions of eroded sediment with soil surface microtopography that make up the erosion processes driven by upslope inflow this study will enhance the interpretion likely the erosion mechanisms at work over the microtopographical scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil samples a layer of topsoil 20 cm thick was collected from slope farmland in ziyang china the study region is situated at an elevation of 410 m a s l with a typical hilly mountain landscape where sloping farmland is extensively distributed large areas of sloping farmlands have subjected to severe soil erosion and subsequent accumulation of eroded sediment in the foothills xiao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 earthen dike terraces composed predominantly of two parts including a ridge and terrace are widely constructed in this region since 2010 to conserve soil loss in recent years the area of earthen dike terraces is gradually decreasing as a result of human interventions in the process of urbanization luo et al 2021 furthermore the stability of earthen dike terraces is also proved threatening by cultivation and rill erosion after rainfall zhou et al 2017 yang et al 2018 extensive fragile terrace landscapes are therefore being the primary area where the convergence and drainage of upslope sediment laded inflow and eventually becoming the major source of eroded sediment in this typical area this area features a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 3 c and precipitation of 965 8 mm 60 85 of which falls from may to september by torrential rainstorms liu et al 2016 soils in this hilly landscape were predominately classified as purple soils that derived from entisols soil survey staff 2010 the soil texture was 49 sand 29 silt and 22 clay table 1 with an organic matter content of 13 g kg 1 luo et al 2022 soil samples were air dried and passed through a 10 mm sieve to ensure homogeneity prior to packing in a soil flume 2 2 experimental devices and design earthen dike terrace in the fields is typically considered to be a barrier area joining the upper and the downstream areas for sloping croplands of purple soil fig 1 a the ridge has almost recently collapsed as a result of the contradiction between the population and the farmland given the effect of terraced fields on the downslope erosion processes a laboratory dual flume scouring experiment in this study was designed to simulate the upslope sediment laded water inflow for hillslopes where upslope drainage contributing area perpetually exists the experimental device of the present study was given as fig 1b the upslope was a feeder soil flume with the function of the upslope contributing drainage area luo et al 2021 while the downslope was the test flume for measuring soil surface microtopography and soil loss both upslope and downslope soil flume were measured with a length width and depth of 2 0 1 0 and 0 4 m respectively an overflow tank was attached to the upper end of the upslope soil flume for supplying the upslope inflow the upslope and downslope soil flume were connected with an interior fastening device composed of a plastic sheet hosepipe and baffle plate the drainage outlets were drilled at the bottom of the baffle plate to ensure that the sediment laden flow enters the downslope soil bed via the stabilized water supply system the hosepipes were fixed at the orifice to regulate sediment laden water flow evenly over the downslope soil flume at a controlled inflow rate following the initiation of runoff the runoff and sediment yields of each run were collected continuously by the triangular device installed at the end of the downslope flume before the experiments a 10 min pre rainfall with 30 mm h 1 intensity was applied on the test soil to enable uniform antecedent soil moisture and eliminate the influence of surface soil variability between different experiments guo et al 2023 the soil surface in the downslope flume was then covered with plastic film to prevent soil moisture evaporation and the experiment was started after 24 h the experimental soil flume was set on a 15 slope three representative upslope inflow rates 4 6 and 8 l min 1 with a constant upslope drainage area of 0 3 m2 were applied on purple soil slopes according to the range of runoff discharge obtained from upslope drainage areas of various earthen dike terraces in field plots under the rainfall condition wang et al 2019 in total six scouring simulation runs were performed corresponding to two replicates of different inflow rates the duration of experiment was dominated by the evolution of rill erosive stages the typical time for each stage of rill development is given in table 2 the scouring flume experiment was stopped to measure the soil surface microtopography as soon as the erosion morphological characteristics of a certain rill erosive stage occurred on the slope 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 three dimensional 3d photo reconstruction of microtopography during each scouring experiment the digital photogrammetric technique was used to acquire images for the reconstruction of soil surface microtopography bauer et al 2015 vinci et al 2020 a basic spatial arrangement of 18 ground reference points grps at the boundary of the soil flume was sought six evenly distributed along the long side and three mainly placed around the lower and upper sides at positions that contained good visibility fig 1c grps coordinates were determined with an electronic total station ets to control potential target movements without disturbing the soil surface a digital camera canon 5d mark iv was used in combination with a nominal fixed focal length of 50 mm lens to capture the soil surface at different rill erosive stages fig 1e raw image data were captured with the highest resolution 5760 3840 and a previous study detailed the capturing of the raw images nouwakpo and huang 2012 approximately 40 images were taken for the soil flume the 3d stereo point clouds were generated under photoscan software agisoft llc v1 2 4 based on the acquired soil surface images using these point clouds obtained by the photogrammetric survey digital elevation models dems with a spatial resolution equal to 4 mm were then acquired the dems at each stage of rill erosion were obtained upon the difference of the prior and post dems of each scouring run fig s1 2 3 2 runoff and sediment measurements for each run the runoff samples from the downslope soil flume were volumetrically measured and sampled using 15 l buckets at 3 minute intervals the gathered samples were settled filtered and oven dried to determine the sediment amount fernández and vega 2014 the sediment and runoff production rates were defined by dividing the mass of sediment or runoff volume per unit area of the eroded soil surface in unit time respectively omidvar et al 2019 simultaneously the sediment samples were collected to measure the effective and ultimate particle size distribution psd of the eroded sediment using a laser diffraction device malvern mastersizer 3000e malvern uk each sample was first transferred to the fluid module that contained 1 7 l of deionized water 20 c and was thereafter subjected to three consecutive 1 min runs at a pump speed of 8 12 l min 1 for determination of the effective psd of the sediment afterward the subsamples were treated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter before being dispersed overnight in sodium hexametaphosphate and were then dispersed by the ultrasonic method 2 4 computational methods 2 4 1 multifractal approach mfa of soil surface microtopography the mfa can be used to quantify how the normalized distribution probability of a variable changes with a range of scales torre et al 2018 the box counting dimension was applied to determine the distribution probability of soil surface elevation luo et al 2017 using a box of scale is ɛ ɛ to cover the tested slope dem for the pixel elevation of each box a probability distribution function pi ε was calculated 1 p i ε h i ε h i ε where hi ε is the number of pixel elevation values the series pi ε was then partitioned into n nonoverlapping spatial intervals of a given box size ε the box probability was obtained by calculating the sum of the normalized fraction for each interval the partition function

sediment particle size distribution the enrichment ratio er of sediment particles can be used to compare the psd of detached sediment with the original soil and provide a measure of psd selectivity of sediment shi et al 2012a 2012b koiter et al 2017 er was calculated as 8 er p e p o where pe is the percentage of each size class of eroded sediment and po is the percentage of each size class of original soil er values 1 represent an enrichment of particle size while er values 1 indicate that the particle size was depleted with respect to the original soil sadeghi et al 2017 the aggregation ratio ar represents the geometric mean particle size of the effective undispersed sediment divided by that of the ultimate dispersed sediment which can act as an indicator of how the different sediment fractions are eroded and transported by runoff martínez mena et al 2002 an effective ultimate ratio e u of 1 indicates that the sediment is transported as primary particles the fractions of eroded sediment are transported as soil aggregates rather than primary particles when e u 1 during dispersion 2 4 3 determination of hydraulic parameters flow velocities were measured using kmno4 as coloration at three monitoring locations of the upper middle and lower parts of the slope each measurement of flow velocity was repeated five times to ensure the accuracy of the experiment the average flow velocity u of the three sections was corrected by multiplying a correction factor of 0 80 for rill flow sun et al 2020 xu et al 2021 the rill flow depth was measured perpendicularly by using a thin ruler with a precision of 0 1 mm the mean value of flow depth was calculated by averaging the measurements obtained from five repetitions of three positions the flow reynolds number re and froude number fr were calculated as mirzaee and ghorbani dashtaki 2018 9 r e ur v s 10 fr u gr where u refers to the average flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m and g is 9 8 m s 2 vs is the

processing and analysis of the dems were performed using arcgis 10 2 software statistical analyses were performed using the spss 22 0 software package one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effects of upslope inflow on sediment particle size distribution at each stage of rill erosion the least significant difference lsd test was employed to determine significant differences among treatments correlations among microtopography sediment particle size distribution and flow hydraulic characteristics were evaluated using pearson s correlation test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 change in the reconstructed soil microtopography 3 1 1 variations characteristics of soil surface elevation based on dem analysis fig 3 shows the variations of soil surface elevation at each stage of rill erosion as driven by inflow rates for the 4 l min 1 inflow rate the elevation of the soil surface was mainly concentrated in the range of 20 mm at the initiation stage of rill development the percentages of elevation variation reached value of 75 while the surface elevation decay gradually increased with the evolution of rill erosion the surface elevation showed a greater decrease during the rill stabilization stage rs due to the soil particles along the intermittent rills were transported by concentrated flow for the 6 l min 1 inflow rate the surface elevation decreases observed at the headward erosion stage he were overall greater than those of the other rill erosive stages for the 8 l min 1 inflow rate the changes of the surface elevation were concentrated between 20 mm and 0 mm during all the rill erosive stages within the average elevation proportion of 56 the surface elevation decay mostly occurred in the later stage of rill erosion and such changes in surface elevation were usually located toward the rill channels during the rs stage 3 1 2 multifractal analysis mfa of soil microtopography to assess the scaling behavior of soil microtopography at various inflow rates the partition functions u q ε versus ε were calculated and presented as log log plots fig 4 shows the regression lines for logu q ε log ε that fit the linear relation for selected values of q the r 2 values were higher than 0 99 indicating the convincing scale invariance of the spatial pattern of soil microrelief at different inflow rates the soil surface microtopography therefore has multiple fractal features within the entire ε range the multifractal structure soil surface microtopography can be represented by sets of parameters table 3 and the multifractal spectrum fig 5 the simple fractal dimension f α max showed that 8 l min 1 6 l min 1 4 l min 1 implying that the spatial variability of soil microtopography increased as the inflow rates increased meanwhile the f α max values were the highest during the rs stage the δα values ranged between 1 7476 and 3 4254 and gradually increased with increasing inflow rates according to table 3 the soil microtopography tended to be sharp with the development of rill erosion with δf α 0 the predominant trends of δd calculated by the difference between d q 3 and d q 3 showed an increasing trend with the increase in inflow rates this result showed that the spatial variability of soil microrelief and soil surface rolling increased gradually as shown in fig 5 the f α α q functions were continuous convex functions indicating that the soil microrelief had heterogeneous properties at different inflow rates the multifractal spectrum of soil microrelief was bell shaped during the drop pit development stage dp suggesting that the microtopography tended to be homogeneous the multifractal spectrum gradually widened with the development of rill erosion and exhibited right hook shapes the asymmetric profiles indicated that the microtopography sharpness was obvious during the rs stage and the asymmetry of the microtopography at 8 l min 1 was more intense than that at 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 3 2 runoff and sediment characteristics during rill erosion 3 2 1 characterizing runoff and sediment yield processes according to fig 6 a the runoff rate gradually increased with increasing scouring time the fluctuation extent of surface runoff gradually receded as the scouring time increased and tended to stabilize during the rs stage the surface runoff significantly increased with increasing inflow rates and the change was typically higher at the 8 l min 1 inflow rate with increases of 90 14 and 15 03 for 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 respectively the total surface runoff was 276 64 l for 8 l min 1 which was 1 90 and 1 15 times larger than of the 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 inflow rates respectively the dynamic changes in sediment yield were different from runoff with scouring time at different inflow rates fig 6b during the dp stage the sediment yields violently decreased at the initial stage of scouring except for the 4 l min 1 inflow rate with the proceeding of scouring duration the sediment yields sharply increased at the ir stage and stabilized at the rs stage the surface runoff gradually increased with the development of rill erosion under different upslope inflow rates fig 6c the rapid increase in runoff for the ir stage resulted in the appearance of the peak value at the earlier stage of the experimental process with the rill erosion developed the values of surface runoff reached a maximum during the rs stage at different inflow rates the sediment yields of rill erosive stages at different inflow rates are shown in fig 6d the sediment yield increased rapidly with increasing inflow rates comparatively the variation in sediment yield at 4 l min 1 was very small within the range of 2572 70 4917 75 g the sediment yield of the 8 l min 1 inflow rate was 3 67 and 1 12 times larger than the 4 and 6 l min 1 inflow rates respectively moreover the 8 l min 1 inflow rate resulted in a high sediment yield for each rill erosion stage and the highest sediment yield was 18072 16 g at the rs stage 3 2 2 particle size distribution psd of eroded sediment during rill erosion the sediment size proportion was highest at the fraction of silt 0 002 0 05 mm according to fig 7 the percentage of clay fractions 0 002 mm in sediments was not 5 under different inflow rates and rill erosive stages and thereby being much smaller than the percentage of clay sized content of 22 in the original soil moreover there were no obvious variations in the sediment particle proportions of clay fractions between each inflow rate during rill erosive stages the proportion of silt fraction sediments was over 40 when the inflow rate was 6 l min 1 and 8 l min 1 during the whole rill erosion stage the sand content 0 05 mm decreased gradually with increasing inflow rates except during the dp stage 3 2 3 enrichment and aggregation ratios of psd to original soil the enrichment ratio er of clay sized particles was less than that of the other particle sizes even at a high inflow rate fig 8 the er values of clay contents were 1 for different inflow rates at various rill erosive stages reflecting the considerable depletion of clay fractions in the rill erosion process for different inflow rate conditions the er values of silt fractions fluctuated with the upslope inflow rate which generally increased with increasing inflow rate at the rs stage moreover the average enrichment ratios of silt sized particles for the 6 l min 1 inflow rate were significantly greater than those for the 4 l min 1 inflow rate at each stage of rill erosion under an inflow rate of 8 l min 1 the average er values of the silt fraction reached 1 36 0 11 during the rill stabilization stage in general there was a more enriched process of silt fraction in the upslope inflow experiment however the er values of the sand fractions decreased when the inflow rate was increased and the er values were in the range of 0 99 to 1 15 a significant decrease in these values among higher inflow rates was shown and was 1 with the rapid development of rills this indicated that sand sized sediments were mostly depleted at the rs stage the variability in the aggregation ratio ar of sediment particles indicated that the clay and silt sized particles first increased and then decreased with increasing inflow rates while the ar values of sand sized particles showed an increasing trend table 4 the ar values of clay sized particles were always 1 with a slight increasing trend during the rill erosive process while the sediment particles with silt and sand sizes changed greatly the ar values for sand sized particles were always 1 indicating that most of these particles were predominantly coarser primary particles 3 3 hydraulic characteristics at different stages of rill erosion fig 9 shows the variations in u τ re fr ω and p during rill erosion at different inflow rates the results showed that the u fr and ω of rill flow in the rill generally increased from the dp to rs stage the average values for measuring flow velocity u ranged from 0 079 to 0 226 m s 1 on slope fig 9a there was a general increase in u with the evolution of rill erosion overall the flow velocity showed an increasing trend with fluctuations when inflow rates increased and the average τ of 8 l min 1 inflow rates was 1 56 and 1 21 times those at 4 l and 6 l min 1 inflow rates during the dp stage respectively fig 9b the average value of τ at the initial rill erosion stage was significantly higher than that at the rs stage for different inflow rates the value of re varied between 283 1 988 3 and reached a maximum at the rs stage table 5 other parameters such as fr ω and p showed similar trends under 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 inflow rates as rill erosion evolved fig 9d f the fluctuation range of fr was between 0 577 and 1 698 during rill erosion and the value was always 1 at the later stage of rill development under an inflow rate of 8 l min 1 the ω decreased at the early stage and then increased with the development of rill erosion at an inflow rate of 8 l min 1 fig 9e compared to the dp stage the p at the rs stage increased 55 63 47 35 and 80 16 in treatments of 4 l min 1 6 l min 1 and 8 l min 1 respectively the flow hydraulic parameters during the rill erosive stage exhibited a large variation range under high inflow rate conditions 4 discussion 4 1 upslope inflow driven variation in soil microtopography and rill erosion many studies have indicated that upslope inflow has a significant influence on both surface microtopography and downslope soil erosion processes li et al 2016 xu et al 2017 luo et al 2021 the results of the present study indicated that the minimum value of surface elevation increased from 120 mm to 100 mm as inflow rates decreased mainly from the decline in runoff energy with a decrease in upslope inflow rates that attenuated rill bed undercutting erosion leading to a reduction in surface elevation shen et al 2018 higher inflow rates enhanced the merger of small rills at the later experimental stage and therefore increased soil microrelief gómez et al 2003 rill networks were generated on the surface caused by concentrated flow on the surface at the rs stage and facilitated an increase in relative elevation along an eroded rill gómez et al 2003 the results of multifractal analysis suggested that the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography increased as inflow rates increased and the microtopography became increasingly sharp with the rapid development of rill erosion it indicated that soil microtopography was the direct consequence of hillslope erosion wu et al 2018 luo et al 2022 the multifractal parameters δα δf α and δd increased with increasing inflow rates indicating that the local variability of soil microtopography was enhanced and the discrete degree of microtopography distribution at higher inflow conditions was upregulated bauer et al 2015 in this study f α max and δα had highly significant positive correlations with reynolds number flow shear stress and stream power according to fig 10 a higher value of re indicated a larger turbulence of inflow leading to a greater scouring energy of runoff and an increase in surface microrelief nicosia et al 2020 the highly significant correlation illustrated that the greater the flow shear stress was the more obvious the spatial heterogeneity of the microtopography became fig 10 this result was fairly inconsistent with the conclusion of wang et al 2017 this could be primarily caused by the shear stress coefficient changes for different surface conditions between rill erosion and interrill erosion takken and govers 2000 the τ value at the initial stage of rill development was significantly higher than that at the rs stage for different inflow rates fig 9b at the earlier stage of scouring experiments sheet erosion played a major role in soil erosion zhang et al 2020 and the flattening of soil bulges and the filling of surface depressions by runoff significantly reduced the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography borselli and torri 2010 however the effect of interrill erosion driven by sheet flow was diminished as rills occurred under high inflow scouring conditions causing relatively large flow shear stress in rills sun et al 2022 this result was also supported by the study of takken and govers 2000 which concluded that upslope inflow induced rill erosion directly affected the relationship of runoff shear stress and surface roughness in general these results provided some support for the assertion that processes of soil microrelief and runoff erosion are interconnected zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2021 unravelling the dynamics of microtopography is therefore essential for modelling erosion processes a series of studies have shown that rill erosion process was significantly affected by rill morphology and surface microtopography in the simulated rainfall and upslope sediment runoff experiments zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2018 shen et al 2018 the differences of the micro topographic spatial differentiation pattern induced by rainfall and sediment laden rill flow should not be ignored during rill erosion therefore considerably more field research is required in the future to fully authenticate and understand the effects of rill development and soil microtopography on downslope erosion under the interaction between rainfall and inflow conditions at the hillslope scale 4 2 the distribution characteristics of the sediment as driven by the upslope inflow during rill erosive stages soil erosion processes were confirmed to be particle size selective shi et al 2012a 2012b wang and shi 2015 and the difference in selective sediment is not only dependent on hydraulic characteristics of flow but also associated with the intrinsic underlying surface properties ni et al 2021 in this study the proportions of silt increased with inflow rate and rill development but the opposite trend was observed for the sand fractions this means that silt sized particles were dominant in rill erosion under different inflow rates these results are also similar to the conclusions of lin et al 2017 and quan et al 2020 unlike the silt and sand sized particles the er and ar values of clay sized particles were always 1 under different inflow rates indicating that considerable depletion of clay fractions was observed for different inflow rate conditions these results were inconsistent with those previously reported by alberts et al 1980 which suggested that the fraction of clay was enriched in the eroded sediment these changes in the reported psd of sediments relative to their parent soils may be the result of differences in their soil properties e g soil texture roughness etc defersha and melesse 2012 ding and huang 2017 the sand sized sediments were mostly enriched and depleted as primary particles with the development of rill erosion fig 8 and table 4 many studies have shown that the enrichment of coarse particles could reduce flow energy propagate transport limited runoff and substantially diminish the resultant erosion in situ rieke zapp et al 2007 therefore the sediment yields were typically lower at the initial stage of rill erosion the inflow induced erosion occurred by the erosive agent of runoff and thus depended on the flow hydrodynamic performance and flow patterns asadi et al 2011 lin et al 2017 pearson correlation analysis indicated that the runoff and erosion rates were greatly affected by the variation in microtopography and inflow patterns p 0 001 and were positively correlated with the er of silt but negatively correlated with the er of sand fig 10 among the flow hydraulic parameters the stream power was positively correlated with the er of silt but negatively correlated with the er of clay and sand sized particles these results were not in line with ni et al 2021 whereby the higher rainfall kinetic energy always resulted in coarsening of the sediment and a coarse armoring of the sediments occurred from the transport of larger particles with high flow energy comparing the psd of sediment and original soil affected by raindrop induced flow transport liu et al 2016 ding and huang 2017 ni et al 2021 we inferred that the finer fractions tended to be preferentially transported by suspension and the fractions of sand showed saltation under upslope inflow induced flow transport in the present study the efficiency of the concentrated inflow is large enough to transport particles that are set in motion or entrained by raindrop impact during rill erosion process zhang 2022 a high proportion of the upslope inflow with certain drainage contributing area is more effective than rainfall at enhancing sediment transport and exacerbating rill erosion on downslope li et al 2016 and the convergence of upslope inflow can increase the erosive energy of the flow in the hillslope and channel thus leading to sharpness of the soil microtopography which could significantly affect the silt sized particle selectivity upslope inflow drove the spatial heterogeneity of the soil microtopography and the distribution of eroded sediment greatly affected runoff and erosion the coupling effects of microtopography and sediment psd and its dynamics could shape the erosion processes altogether by upslope inflow driven our research therefore highlighted the value of a connection with sediment dynamics and microtopography variations that greatly affected rill erosion and suggested the importance of including them in the prediction of soil erosion although the transportation of soil particles by upslope inflow impact had great influence on the downslope erosion process numerous studies capra et al 2009 jomaa et al 2010 gong et al 2011 have emphasised the importance of rainfall on these processes which may be related to the rainfall splashing effect on different upslope inflow conditions but generally the water depth of overland flow was typically of the order of millimeters to several centimeters as soon as rill occurs which was much greater than raindrop diameter kinnell 2022 consequently the sediment entrainment by overland flow becomes dominant on hillslope beuselinck et al 2002 peng et al 2015 wu et al 2019 however it is apparent that the combined effects of rainfall and upslope inflow on rill erosion must be considered in different areas 5 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the behaviors and interactions of eroded sediment and soil surface microtopography that make up the erosion processes driven by upslope inflow on hillslopes the results supported that the spatial heterogeneity of the microtopography increased with increasing upslope inflow rates and the microtopography tended to be sharp with the development of rill erosion the runoff and soil loss gradually increased as the inflow rate increased the change in flow hydraulic parameters during rill erosive stages presented a large variation range under high inflow rates conditions the results of the sediment sorting associated with the transport mechanism in upslope inflow induced rill erosion indicated that the disintegration of aggregates during erosion processes could easily enrich the soil in fine particles especially clay sized particles silt particles were mostly transported as primary particles and were enriched in eroded sediment and the enrichment degree was larger than that of sand sized particles the aggregation of sand fractions was relatively poor during rill erosion and a certain percentage of fine and sand was transported in the form of single particles the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography had a relatively higher influence on sediment sorting during rill erosion under the upslope inflow conditions the multifractal parameters of soil surface microtopography except for δf α were positively correlated with the er of silt and negatively correlated with the er of sand sized particles runoff and erosion rates were obviously affected by the variation in microtopography and inflow patterns as well as eroded sediment sorting these results underline that interaction of soil surface microtopography and the processes of erosion promote an improved apprehending of the dynamics of sediment transport on hillslope the feedback effects of soil surface microtopography on sediment dynamics was discernable and should be considered and incorporated into soil models to evaluate the erosion behavior especially on hillslope area where upslope inflow perpetually exists this research therefore proposes the need for consideration of the essential variables with sediment dynamics and microtopography that greatly affected rill erosion and ascertain the importance of including them in the prediction of soil

1793,upslope drainage area contributing inflow to downslope rill erosion can be affected by the dynamics of eroded sediment and soil surface microtopography however limited information has previously not recognized the variation of the sediment particles and microtopography on hillslopes where upslope inflow perpetually exists a series of scouring flume experiments were performed on a 15 slope under upslope inflow rates 4 6 and 8 l min 1 to investigate the inflow driven microtopography and sediment particle size distribution psd during the rill erosion process the results indicated that the surface elevation decay mostly occurred in the later stage of rill erosion the spatial variability of microtopography increased gradually with increasing inflow rates and obvious microtopography sharpness intensified with the development of rill erosion the surface runoff under the 8 l min 1 inflow rate increased by 15 03 and 90 14 for 6 and 4 l min 1 respectively and the sediment yield reached a maximum at the rill stabilization stage rs the overall particle size distribution was mainly composed of silt sized particles accounting for approximately 40 97 50 15 of the total eroded sediment considerable depletion of clay fractions occurred in the rill erosion process high inflow rate significantly enhanced variation amplitude of critical hydrodynamic parameters e g flow velocity flow shear stress and reynolds number the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography was correlated with the coarser fraction of sediment psd in rill erosion suggesting that erosion processes were affected by the interaction between eroded sediment distribution and roughness these findings highlight the importance of the psd of eroded sediment and the development of soil surface structure for an in depth understanding of the purple soil erosion mechanism at the hillslope scale keywords particle size distribution soil surface microtopography rill erosion upslope sediment laden inflow purple soil data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rill erosion is the dominant sediment source on hillslope scales with favorable conditions for evolving ephemeral and even permanent gully erosion di stefano et al 2017 ou et al 2021 it usually occurs in human disturbed areas especially in sloping farmland where rill erosion induced soil erosion contributes to more than approximately 50 of the total soil loss he et al 2014 rill erosion and subsequent transport of eroded sediment by water flowing into rill channels can have negative effects on soil quality and agricultural production on sloping farmland the rill erosion process mainly includes three subprocesses soil detachment sediment transport by concentrated flow and deposition kimaro et al 2008 these processes tend to be accompanied by a dynamic selectivity of particle and aggregate size asadi et al 2007 2011 shi et al 2012a lin et al 2017 with significant differences in the response of various sediment size characteristics to erosion the change in the particle size distribution psd of eroded sediments may depend on which erosion process is dominant in this regard the sediment size selectivity of rill erosion has been reported wang and shi 2015 thompson et al 2016 and large differences have been found in soil aggregates and primary particles transported by erosive agents of rill flow asadi et al 2007 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2021 previous studies concluded that eroded sediment was enriched in the fractions of clay and silt particles relative to the original soil in both raindrop and overland flow driven induced erosion events and their composition becomes very similar to that of the original soil at the steady overland flow state defersha and melesse 2012 in addition luk et al 1993 found that the soil transported in rill flow is generally dominated by fine particles with small dimensions of the rills however in some cases it has been observed that the sediment size distribution is bimodal during erosion events asadi et al 2007 especially in overland flow induced rill erosion processes zhang et al 2003 shi et al 2012b although great efforts have been made to investigate the size selectivity of eroded sediment during rill erosion processes most of these studies have focused on the effect of the interaction between erosion processes driven by rainfall and overland flow asadi et al 2011 the upslope inflow with certain drainage contributing area is more effective than rainfall at enhancing sediment transport on downslope on the hillslope scale upslope inflow not only has great impacts on runoff and the soil erosion rate li et al 2016 wang et al 2020 but also changes the soil transport capacity of runoff tian et al 2017 xu et al 2017 which may alter flow hydraulics and sediment sorting however the information concerning the effect of upslope inflow on the psd of eroded sediment during rill erosion processes is not available the psd of the eroded sediment with the development of rills is controlled by near surface characteristics and flow hydraulic features lin et al 2017 in an overland flow dominated erosion pattern the surface flow hydraulics will be highly associated with the size distribution of the eroded sediment baigorria and romero 2007 under flow driven erosion at low streampowers asadi et al 2007 found that the mass fractions of different sediment sizes are almost distributed as a bimodal type laboratory studies undertaken by wang and shi 2015 showed that the eroded sediment becomes nonselective after rill flow shear stress exceeds its critical value since there is high dynamic water flow and instability of the boundaries the type of sediment sorting can be changed during the processes of erosion transport and sedimentation han et al 2021 nevertheless there are limited data regarding the sediment psd changes during the rill erosion process separately on hillslopes where upslope inflow perpetually exists soil surface microtopography is one of the important factors controlling runoff generation and sediment transportation bullard et al 2018 and consequently affecting sediment sorting associated with transport mechanisms on slopes chen et al 2013 a previous study was conducted to investigate the impact of soil surface microtopography on interrill erosion processes and the psd of sediment particles under rainfall conditions which observed that the eroded sediment was less selection on smooth than on rough soil surfaces ding and huang 2017 however due to the highly dynamic and random features of the surface microtopography changes in rill erosion processes luo et al 2021 the mechanisms of the microtopography effect on soil erosion are controversial moreover the characteristics of the microtopography dynamic response to runoff were previously neglected a better understanding of the dynamics of the soil surface microtopography will therefore improve the understanding of both erosion and sedimentation processes shi et al 2012a additionally information concerning the sediment distribution and its dynamics with relation to soil surface microtopography is thus required to elucidate the behaviors and interactions of these components that interoperate in the rill erosion process yang and chu 2015 numerous studies have shown that the eroded sediment is primarily effected by both raindrop and runoff on hillslope erosion asadi et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2017 ni et al 2021 the upslope inflow is more prominent than rainfall intensity in increasing the sediment transport capacity of runoff in the water erosion process and causes a more complex redistribution of eroded sediment and flow hydraulics xu et al 2017 however the upslope inflow driven erosion process and the dynamics of sediment sorting on hillslopes have rarely been reported in purple soil hilly region of southwest china upslope inflow is considered to be an important driving force for soil erosion of sloping farmland wang et al 2019 in addition the earthen dike terrace as an engineering measure for conserving soil and water on sloping farmland has almost became the extensive and fragile terrace landscapes as a result of human interventions in this region the stability of terraced fields in recent decades is also threatened by cultivation and rill erosion after rainfall zhou et al 2017 yang et al 2018 a large proportion of earthen dike terraces serving as the upslope drainage area have contributed to the variations in inflow rates and sediment concentrations in the downslope farmland area which led to an increase in rill erosion wang et al 2019 rill erosion is an important linear erosion feature that can be greatly influenced by the interactions between soil surface microtopography and sediment particle size distribution psd ding and huang 2017 although the effect of sediment concentration on the spatial variation in microtopography has been examined under the different upslope drainage areas and inflow conditions in this area luo et al 2021 nevertheless the selection and dynamics of sediment particles associated with soil surface microtopography as well as their potential variation in the erosion process are still not clear under increasing upslope flow driven conditions ascertaining the relationship between sediment dynamics and soil surface microtopography is probably a better indicator for determining how sediment is transported by upslope inflow on hillslopes the aims of the present study were to i characterize the effects of the upslope inflow rate on runoff sediment yield and soil microtopography ii quantify detailed information regarding the particle size distribution of eroded sediment driven by upslope inflow and iii elucidate the hydrodynamic behaviors of inflow and interactions of eroded sediment with soil surface microtopography that make up the erosion processes driven by upslope inflow this study will enhance the interpretion likely the erosion mechanisms at work over the microtopographical scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil samples a layer of topsoil 20 cm thick was collected from slope farmland in ziyang china the study region is situated at an elevation of 410 m a s l with a typical hilly mountain landscape where sloping farmland is extensively distributed large areas of sloping farmlands have subjected to severe soil erosion and subsequent accumulation of eroded sediment in the foothills xiao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 earthen dike terraces composed predominantly of two parts including a ridge and terrace are widely constructed in this region since 2010 to conserve soil loss in recent years the area of earthen dike terraces is gradually decreasing as a result of human interventions in the process of urbanization luo et al 2021 furthermore the stability of earthen dike terraces is also proved threatening by cultivation and rill erosion after rainfall zhou et al 2017 yang et al 2018 extensive fragile terrace landscapes are therefore being the primary area where the convergence and drainage of upslope sediment laded inflow and eventually becoming the major source of eroded sediment in this typical area this area features a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 3 c and precipitation of 965 8 mm 60 85 of which falls from may to september by torrential rainstorms liu et al 2016 soils in this hilly landscape were predominately classified as purple soils that derived from entisols soil survey staff 2010 the soil texture was 49 sand 29 silt and 22 clay table 1 with an organic matter content of 13 g kg 1 luo et al 2022 soil samples were air dried and passed through a 10 mm sieve to ensure homogeneity prior to packing in a soil flume 2 2 experimental devices and design earthen dike terrace in the fields is typically considered to be a barrier area joining the upper and the downstream areas for sloping croplands of purple soil fig 1 a the ridge has almost recently collapsed as a result of the contradiction between the population and the farmland given the effect of terraced fields on the downslope erosion processes a laboratory dual flume scouring experiment in this study was designed to simulate the upslope sediment laded water inflow for hillslopes where upslope drainage contributing area perpetually exists the experimental device of the present study was given as fig 1b the upslope was a feeder soil flume with the function of the upslope contributing drainage area luo et al 2021 while the downslope was the test flume for measuring soil surface microtopography and soil loss both upslope and downslope soil flume were measured with a length width and depth of 2 0 1 0 and 0 4 m respectively an overflow tank was attached to the upper end of the upslope soil flume for supplying the upslope inflow the upslope and downslope soil flume were connected with an interior fastening device composed of a plastic sheet hosepipe and baffle plate the drainage outlets were drilled at the bottom of the baffle plate to ensure that the sediment laden flow enters the downslope soil bed via the stabilized water supply system the hosepipes were fixed at the orifice to regulate sediment laden water flow evenly over the downslope soil flume at a controlled inflow rate following the initiation of runoff the runoff and sediment yields of each run were collected continuously by the triangular device installed at the end of the downslope flume before the experiments a 10 min pre rainfall with 30 mm h 1 intensity was applied on the test soil to enable uniform antecedent soil moisture and eliminate the influence of surface soil variability between different experiments guo et al 2023 the soil surface in the downslope flume was then covered with plastic film to prevent soil moisture evaporation and the experiment was started after 24 h the experimental soil flume was set on a 15 slope three representative upslope inflow rates 4 6 and 8 l min 1 with a constant upslope drainage area of 0 3 m2 were applied on purple soil slopes according to the range of runoff discharge obtained from upslope drainage areas of various earthen dike terraces in field plots under the rainfall condition wang et al 2019 in total six scouring simulation runs were performed corresponding to two replicates of different inflow rates the duration of experiment was dominated by the evolution of rill erosive stages the typical time for each stage of rill development is given in table 2 the scouring flume experiment was stopped to measure the soil surface microtopography as soon as the erosion morphological characteristics of a certain rill erosive stage occurred on the slope 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 three dimensional 3d photo reconstruction of microtopography during each scouring experiment the digital photogrammetric technique was used to acquire images for the reconstruction of soil surface microtopography bauer et al 2015 vinci et al 2020 a basic spatial arrangement of 18 ground reference points grps at the boundary of the soil flume was sought six evenly distributed along the long side and three mainly placed around the lower and upper sides at positions that contained good visibility fig 1c grps coordinates were determined with an electronic total station ets to control potential target movements without disturbing the soil surface a digital camera canon 5d mark iv was used in combination with a nominal fixed focal length of 50 mm lens to capture the soil surface at different rill erosive stages fig 1e raw image data were captured with the highest resolution 5760 3840 and a previous study detailed the capturing of the raw images nouwakpo and huang 2012 approximately 40 images were taken for the soil flume the 3d stereo point clouds were generated under photoscan software agisoft llc v1 2 4 based on the acquired soil surface images using these point clouds obtained by the photogrammetric survey digital elevation models dems with a spatial resolution equal to 4 mm were then acquired the dems at each stage of rill erosion were obtained upon the difference of the prior and post dems of each scouring run fig s1 2 3 2 runoff and sediment measurements for each run the runoff samples from the downslope soil flume were volumetrically measured and sampled using 15 l buckets at 3 minute intervals the gathered samples were settled filtered and oven dried to determine the sediment amount fernández and vega 2014 the sediment and runoff production rates were defined by dividing the mass of sediment or runoff volume per unit area of the eroded soil surface in unit time respectively omidvar et al 2019 simultaneously the sediment samples were collected to measure the effective and ultimate particle size distribution psd of the eroded sediment using a laser diffraction device malvern mastersizer 3000e malvern uk each sample was first transferred to the fluid module that contained 1 7 l of deionized water 20 c and was thereafter subjected to three consecutive 1 min runs at a pump speed of 8 12 l min 1 for determination of the effective psd of the sediment afterward the subsamples were treated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter before being dispersed overnight in sodium hexametaphosphate and were then dispersed by the ultrasonic method 2 4 computational methods 2 4 1 multifractal approach mfa of soil surface microtopography the mfa can be used to quantify how the normalized distribution probability of a variable changes with a range of scales torre et al 2018 the box counting dimension was applied to determine the distribution probability of soil surface elevation luo et al 2017 using a box of scale is ɛ ɛ to cover the tested slope dem for the pixel elevation of each box a probability distribution function pi ε was calculated 1 p i ε h i ε h i ε where hi ε is the number of pixel elevation values the series pi ε was then partitioned into n nonoverlapping spatial intervals of a given box size ε the box probability was obtained by calculating the sum of the normalized fraction for each interval the partition function was determined by 2a u q ε i 1 n ε p i ε q 2b u q ε ε τ q where q is the weighting factor and q in this study the q values varied from 3 to 3 with a spacing of 0 5 τ q is the scaling exponent of order

sediment particle size distribution the enrichment ratio er of sediment particles can be used to compare the psd of detached sediment with the original soil and provide a measure of psd selectivity of sediment shi et al 2012a 2012b koiter et al 2017 er was calculated as 8 er p e p o where pe is the percentage of each size class of eroded sediment and po is the percentage of each size class of original soil er values 1 represent an enrichment of particle size while er values 1 indicate that the particle size was depleted with respect to the original soil sadeghi et al 2017 the aggregation ratio ar represents the geometric mean particle size of the effective undispersed sediment divided by that of the ultimate dispersed sediment which can act as an indicator of how the different sediment fractions are eroded and transported by runoff martínez mena et al 2002 an effective ultimate ratio e u of 1 indicates that the sediment is transported as primary particles the fractions of eroded sediment are transported as soil aggregates rather than primary particles when e u 1 during dispersion 2 4 3 determination of hydraulic parameters flow velocities were measured using kmno4 as coloration at three monitoring locations of the upper middle and lower parts of the slope each measurement of flow velocity was repeated five times to ensure the accuracy of the experiment the average flow velocity u of the three sections was corrected by multiplying a correction factor of 0 80 for rill flow sun et al 2020 xu et al 2021 the rill flow depth was measured perpendicularly by using a thin ruler with a precision of 0 1 mm the mean value of flow depth was calculated by averaging the measurements obtained from five repetitions of three positions the flow reynolds number re and froude number fr were calculated as mirzaee and ghorbani dashtaki 2018 9 r e ur v s 10 fr u gr where u refers to the average flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m and g is 9 8 m s 2 vs is the

processing and analysis of the dems were performed using arcgis 10 2 software statistical analyses were performed using the spss 22 0 software package one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effects of upslope inflow on sediment particle size distribution at each stage of rill erosion the least significant difference lsd test was employed to determine significant differences among treatments correlations among microtopography sediment particle size distribution and flow hydraulic characteristics were evaluated using pearson s correlation test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 change in the reconstructed soil microtopography 3 1 1 variations characteristics of soil surface elevation based on dem analysis fig 3 shows the variations of soil surface elevation at each stage of rill erosion as driven by inflow rates for the 4 l min 1 inflow rate the elevation of the soil surface was mainly concentrated in the range of 20 mm at the initiation stage of rill development the percentages of elevation variation reached value of 75 while the surface elevation decay gradually increased with the evolution of rill erosion the surface elevation showed a greater decrease during the rill stabilization stage rs due to the soil particles along the intermittent rills were transported by concentrated flow for the 6 l min 1 inflow rate the surface elevation decreases observed at the headward erosion stage he were overall greater than those of the other rill erosive stages for the 8 l min 1 inflow rate the changes of the surface elevation were concentrated between 20 mm and 0 mm during all the rill erosive stages within the average elevation proportion of 56 the surface elevation decay mostly occurred in the later stage of rill erosion and such changes in surface elevation were usually located toward the rill channels during the rs stage 3 1 2 multifractal analysis mfa of soil microtopography to assess the scaling behavior of soil microtopography at various inflow rates the partition functions u q ε versus ε were calculated and presented as log log plots fig 4 shows the regression lines for logu q ε log ε that fit the linear relation for selected values of q the r 2 values were higher than 0 99 indicating the convincing scale invariance of the spatial pattern of soil microrelief at different inflow rates the soil surface microtopography therefore has multiple fractal features within the entire ε range the multifractal structure soil surface microtopography can be represented by sets of parameters table 3 and the multifractal spectrum fig 5 the simple fractal dimension f α max showed that 8 l min 1 6 l min 1 4 l min 1 implying that the spatial variability of soil microtopography increased as the inflow rates increased meanwhile the f α max values were the highest during the rs stage the δα values ranged between 1 7476 and 3 4254 and gradually increased with increasing inflow rates according to table 3 the soil microtopography tended to be sharp with the development of rill erosion with δf α 0 the predominant trends of δd calculated by the difference between d q 3 and d q 3 showed an increasing trend with the increase in inflow rates this result showed that the spatial variability of soil microrelief and soil surface rolling increased gradually as shown in fig 5 the f α α q functions were continuous convex functions indicating that the soil microrelief had heterogeneous properties at different inflow rates the multifractal spectrum of soil microrelief was bell shaped during the drop pit development stage dp suggesting that the microtopography tended to be homogeneous the multifractal spectrum gradually widened with the development of rill erosion and exhibited right hook shapes the asymmetric profiles indicated that the microtopography sharpness was obvious during the rs stage and the asymmetry of the microtopography at 8 l min 1 was more intense than that at 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 3 2 runoff and sediment characteristics during rill erosion 3 2 1 characterizing runoff and sediment yield processes according to fig 6 a the runoff rate gradually increased with increasing scouring time the fluctuation extent of surface runoff gradually receded as the scouring time increased and tended to stabilize during the rs stage the surface runoff significantly increased with increasing inflow rates and the change was typically higher at the 8 l min 1 inflow rate with increases of 90 14 and 15 03 for 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 respectively the total surface runoff was 276 64 l for 8 l min 1 which was 1 90 and 1 15 times larger than of the 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 inflow rates respectively the dynamic changes in sediment yield were different from runoff with scouring time at different inflow rates fig 6b during the dp stage the sediment yields violently decreased at the initial stage of scouring except for the 4 l min 1 inflow rate with the proceeding of scouring duration the sediment yields sharply increased at the ir stage and stabilized at the rs stage the surface runoff gradually increased with the development of rill erosion under different upslope inflow rates fig 6c the rapid increase in runoff for the ir stage resulted in the appearance of the peak value at the earlier stage of the experimental process with the rill erosion developed the values of surface runoff reached a maximum during the rs stage at different inflow rates the sediment yields of rill erosive stages at different inflow rates are shown in fig 6d the sediment yield increased rapidly with increasing inflow rates comparatively the variation in sediment yield at 4 l min 1 was very small within the range of 2572 70 4917 75 g the sediment yield of the 8 l min 1 inflow rate was 3 67 and 1 12 times larger than the 4 and 6 l min 1 inflow rates respectively moreover the 8 l min 1 inflow rate resulted in a high sediment yield for each rill erosion stage and the highest sediment yield was 18072 16 g at the rs stage 3 2 2 particle size distribution psd of eroded sediment during rill erosion the sediment size proportion was highest at the fraction of silt 0 002 0 05 mm according to fig 7 the percentage of clay fractions 0 002 mm in sediments was not 5 under different inflow rates and rill erosive stages and thereby being much smaller than the percentage of clay sized content of 22 in the original soil moreover there were no obvious variations in the sediment particle proportions of clay fractions between each inflow rate during rill erosive stages the proportion of silt fraction sediments was over 40 when the inflow rate was 6 l min 1 and 8 l min 1 during the whole rill erosion stage the sand content 0 05 mm decreased gradually with increasing inflow rates except during the dp stage 3 2 3 enrichment and aggregation ratios of psd to original soil the enrichment ratio er of clay sized particles was less than that of the other particle sizes even at a high inflow rate fig 8 the er values of clay contents were 1 for different inflow rates at various rill erosive stages reflecting the considerable depletion of clay fractions in the rill erosion process for different inflow rate conditions the er values of silt fractions fluctuated with the upslope inflow rate which generally increased with increasing inflow rate at the rs stage moreover the average enrichment ratios of silt sized particles for the 6 l min 1 inflow rate were significantly greater than those for the 4 l min 1 inflow rate at each stage of rill erosion under an inflow rate of 8 l min 1 the average er values of the silt fraction reached 1 36 0 11 during the rill stabilization stage in general there was a more enriched process of silt fraction in the upslope inflow experiment however the er values of the sand fractions decreased when the inflow rate was increased and the er values were in the range of 0 99 to 1 15 a significant decrease in these values among higher inflow rates was shown and was 1 with the rapid development of rills this indicated that sand sized sediments were mostly depleted at the rs stage the variability in the aggregation ratio ar of sediment particles indicated that the clay and silt sized particles first increased and then decreased with increasing inflow rates while the ar values of sand sized particles showed an increasing trend table 4 the ar values of clay sized particles were always 1 with a slight increasing trend during the rill erosive process while the sediment particles with silt and sand sizes changed greatly the ar values for sand sized particles were always 1 indicating that most of these particles were predominantly coarser primary particles 3 3 hydraulic characteristics at different stages of rill erosion fig 9 shows the variations in u τ re fr ω and p during rill erosion at different inflow rates the results showed that the u fr and ω of rill flow in the rill generally increased from the dp to rs stage the average values for measuring flow velocity u ranged from 0 079 to 0 226 m s 1 on slope fig 9a there was a general increase in u with the evolution of rill erosion overall the flow velocity showed an increasing trend with fluctuations when inflow rates increased and the average τ of 8 l min 1 inflow rates was 1 56 and 1 21 times those at 4 l and 6 l min 1 inflow rates during the dp stage respectively fig 9b the average value of τ at the initial rill erosion stage was significantly higher than that at the rs stage for different inflow rates the value of re varied between 283 1 988 3 and reached a maximum at the rs stage table 5 other parameters such as fr ω and p showed similar trends under 4 l min 1 and 6 l min 1 inflow rates as rill erosion evolved fig 9d f the fluctuation range of fr was between 0 577 and 1 698 during rill erosion and the value was always 1 at the later stage of rill development under an inflow rate of 8 l min 1 the ω decreased at the early stage and then increased with the development of rill erosion at an inflow rate of 8 l min 1 fig 9e compared to the dp stage the p at the rs stage increased 55 63 47 35 and 80 16 in treatments of 4 l min 1 6 l min 1 and 8 l min 1 respectively the flow hydraulic parameters during the rill erosive stage exhibited a large variation range under high inflow rate conditions 4 discussion 4 1 upslope inflow driven variation in soil microtopography and rill erosion many studies have indicated that upslope inflow has a significant influence on both surface microtopography and downslope soil erosion processes li et al 2016 xu et al 2017 luo et al 2021 the results of the present study indicated that the minimum value of surface elevation increased from 120 mm to 100 mm as inflow rates decreased mainly from the decline in runoff energy with a decrease in upslope inflow rates that attenuated rill bed undercutting erosion leading to a reduction in surface elevation shen et al 2018 higher inflow rates enhanced the merger of small rills at the later experimental stage and therefore increased soil microrelief gómez et al 2003 rill networks were generated on the surface caused by concentrated flow on the surface at the rs stage and facilitated an increase in relative elevation along an eroded rill gómez et al 2003 the results of multifractal analysis suggested that the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography increased as inflow rates increased and the microtopography became increasingly sharp with the rapid development of rill erosion it indicated that soil microtopography was the direct consequence of hillslope erosion wu et al 2018 luo et al 2022 the multifractal parameters δα δf α and δd increased with increasing inflow rates indicating that the local variability of soil microtopography was enhanced and the discrete degree of microtopography distribution at higher inflow conditions was upregulated bauer et al 2015 in this study f α max and δα had highly significant positive correlations with reynolds number flow shear stress and stream power according to fig 10 a higher value of re indicated a larger turbulence of inflow leading to a greater scouring energy of runoff and an increase in surface microrelief nicosia et al 2020 the highly significant correlation illustrated that the greater the flow shear stress was the more obvious the spatial heterogeneity of the microtopography became fig 10 this result was fairly inconsistent with the conclusion of wang et al 2017 this could be primarily caused by the shear stress coefficient changes for different surface conditions between rill erosion and interrill erosion takken and govers 2000 the τ value at the initial stage of rill development was significantly higher than that at the rs stage for different inflow rates fig 9b at the earlier stage of scouring experiments sheet erosion played a major role in soil erosion zhang et al 2020 and the flattening of soil bulges and the filling of surface depressions by runoff significantly reduced the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography borselli and torri 2010 however the effect of interrill erosion driven by sheet flow was diminished as rills occurred under high inflow scouring conditions causing relatively large flow shear stress in rills sun et al 2022 this result was also supported by the study of takken and govers 2000 which concluded that upslope inflow induced rill erosion directly affected the relationship of runoff shear stress and surface roughness in general these results provided some support for the assertion that processes of soil microrelief and runoff erosion are interconnected zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2021 unravelling the dynamics of microtopography is therefore essential for modelling erosion processes a series of studies have shown that rill erosion process was significantly affected by rill morphology and surface microtopography in the simulated rainfall and upslope sediment runoff experiments zhang et al 2015 luo et al 2018 shen et al 2018 the differences of the micro topographic spatial differentiation pattern induced by rainfall and sediment laden rill flow should not be ignored during rill erosion therefore considerably more field research is required in the future to fully authenticate and understand the effects of rill development and soil microtopography on downslope erosion under the interaction between rainfall and inflow conditions at the hillslope scale 4 2 the distribution characteristics of the sediment as driven by the upslope inflow during rill erosive stages soil erosion processes were confirmed to be particle size selective shi et al 2012a 2012b wang and shi 2015 and the difference in selective sediment is not only dependent on hydraulic characteristics of flow but also associated with the intrinsic underlying surface properties ni et al 2021 in this study the proportions of silt increased with inflow rate and rill development but the opposite trend was observed for the sand fractions this means that silt sized particles were dominant in rill erosion under different inflow rates these results are also similar to the conclusions of lin et al 2017 and quan et al 2020 unlike the silt and sand sized particles the er and ar values of clay sized particles were always 1 under different inflow rates indicating that considerable depletion of clay fractions was observed for different inflow rate conditions these results were inconsistent with those previously reported by alberts et al 1980 which suggested that the fraction of clay was enriched in the eroded sediment these changes in the reported psd of sediments relative to their parent soils may be the result of differences in their soil properties e g soil texture roughness etc defersha and melesse 2012 ding and huang 2017 the sand sized sediments were mostly enriched and depleted as primary particles with the development of rill erosion fig 8 and table 4 many studies have shown that the enrichment of coarse particles could reduce flow energy propagate transport limited runoff and substantially diminish the resultant erosion in situ rieke zapp et al 2007 therefore the sediment yields were typically lower at the initial stage of rill erosion the inflow induced erosion occurred by the erosive agent of runoff and thus depended on the flow hydrodynamic performance and flow patterns asadi et al 2011 lin et al 2017 pearson correlation analysis indicated that the runoff and erosion rates were greatly affected by the variation in microtopography and inflow patterns p 0 001 and were positively correlated with the er of silt but negatively correlated with the er of sand fig 10 among the flow hydraulic parameters the stream power was positively correlated with the er of silt but negatively correlated with the er of clay and sand sized particles these results were not in line with ni et al 2021 whereby the higher rainfall kinetic energy always resulted in coarsening of the sediment and a coarse armoring of the sediments occurred from the transport of larger particles with high flow energy comparing the psd of sediment and original soil affected by raindrop induced flow transport liu et al 2016 ding and huang 2017 ni et al 2021 we inferred that the finer fractions tended to be preferentially transported by suspension and the fractions of sand showed saltation under upslope inflow induced flow transport in the present study the efficiency of the concentrated inflow is large enough to transport particles that are set in motion or entrained by raindrop impact during rill erosion process zhang 2022 a high proportion of the upslope inflow with certain drainage contributing area is more effective than rainfall at enhancing sediment transport and exacerbating rill erosion on downslope li et al 2016 and the convergence of upslope inflow can increase the erosive energy of the flow in the hillslope and channel thus leading to sharpness of the soil microtopography which could significantly affect the silt sized particle selectivity upslope inflow drove the spatial heterogeneity of the soil microtopography and the distribution of eroded sediment greatly affected runoff and erosion the coupling effects of microtopography and sediment psd and its dynamics could shape the erosion processes altogether by upslope inflow driven our research therefore highlighted the value of a connection with sediment dynamics and microtopography variations that greatly affected rill erosion and suggested the importance of including them in the prediction of soil erosion although the transportation of soil particles by upslope inflow impact had great influence on the downslope erosion process numerous studies capra et al 2009 jomaa et al 2010 gong et al 2011 have emphasised the importance of rainfall on these processes which may be related to the rainfall splashing effect on different upslope inflow conditions but generally the water depth of overland flow was typically of the order of millimeters to several centimeters as soon as rill occurs which was much greater than raindrop diameter kinnell 2022 consequently the sediment entrainment by overland flow becomes dominant on hillslope beuselinck et al 2002 peng et al 2015 wu et al 2019 however it is apparent that the combined effects of rainfall and upslope inflow on rill erosion must be considered in different areas 5 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the behaviors and interactions of eroded sediment and soil surface microtopography that make up the erosion processes driven by upslope inflow on hillslopes the results supported that the spatial heterogeneity of the microtopography increased with increasing upslope inflow rates and the microtopography tended to be sharp with the development of rill erosion the runoff and soil loss gradually increased as the inflow rate increased the change in flow hydraulic parameters during rill erosive stages presented a large variation range under high inflow rates conditions the results of the sediment sorting associated with the transport mechanism in upslope inflow induced rill erosion indicated that the disintegration of aggregates during erosion processes could easily enrich the soil in fine particles especially clay sized particles silt particles were mostly transported as primary particles and were enriched in eroded sediment and the enrichment degree was larger than that of sand sized particles the aggregation of sand fractions was relatively poor during rill erosion and a certain percentage of fine and sand was transported in the form of single particles the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography had a relatively higher influence on sediment sorting during rill erosion under the upslope inflow conditions the multifractal parameters of soil surface microtopography except for δf α were positively correlated with the er of silt and negatively correlated with the er of sand sized particles runoff and erosion rates were obviously affected by the variation in microtopography and inflow patterns as well as eroded sediment sorting these results underline that interaction of soil surface microtopography and the processes of erosion promote an improved apprehending of the dynamics of sediment transport on hillslope the feedback effects of soil surface microtopography on sediment dynamics was discernable and should be considered and incorporated into soil models to evaluate the erosion behavior especially on hillslope area where upslope inflow perpetually exists this research therefore proposes the need for consideration of the essential variables with sediment dynamics and microtopography that greatly affected rill erosion and ascertain the importance of including them in the prediction of soil

1794,groundwater depletion is a worldwide concern and an emerging issue in regions such as the mekong river basin mrb however even the natural dynamics of groundwater in the mrb is yet to be fully explored making the quantification of groundwater response to climate variability and anthropogenic activities a major scientific challenge here we examine various groundwater mechanisms in the mrb focusing on groundwater flow processes that are modulated by climate variability physiographic features and key drivers of groundwater surface water interactions we further quantify the influence of anthropogenic activities on groundwater dynamics we use the community land model version 5 clm5 at 0 05 5km spatial resolution with an improved representation of groundwater processes including lateral groundwater flow and aquifer pumping for irrigation results indicate high spatial heterogeneity in groundwater recharge and discharge across the basin governed by climate and subsurface characteristics a pronounced seasonality is found in groundwater recharge due to precipitation 52 of wet season precipitation recharges groundwater with substantial carryover to the consecutive dry season that alleviates soil moisture importantly groundwater discharge is a dominant source of streamflow all year round which suggests a strong surface water groundwater coupling in the mrb finally our results indicate that irrigation pumping is directly altering groundwater flows and storages climate variability smoothens pumping effects over long times but the model simulates region wide groundwater depletion up to 1 m year in the mekong delta during dry years our study provides key insights on the evolving groundwater systems in the mrb also advancing process based groundwater

miguez macho and fan 2012a it is the world s largest freshwater resource that supplies water to billions of people forms an integral part of irrigated agriculture and contributes to the health of many ecosystems siebert döll 2010 cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson et al 2012 at least one fourth of the world s population heavily relies on groundwater döll 2009 the dependence will likely continue to grow in the future due to the increase in population and associated demands for water especially agricultural siebert döll 2010 siebert et al 2015 agricultural irrigation which accounts for over 70 of the total freshwater withdrawal and 90 of the consumptive water use gleick 2018 shiklomanov 2000 is reliant heavily on groundwater in many global regions especially those with limited surface water hanasaki et al 2013 leng et al 2014 reinecke et al 2021 wada et al 2013 this reliance is expected to rise sharply owing to increased irrigation needs in relatively dry agricultural regions ambika and mishra 2019 crosbie et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2013 or even in relatively humid regions such as the mekong river basin mrb that are experiencing rapid agricultural intensification hoang et al 2019 nguyen et al 2012 sakamoto et al 2009 or increased groundwater pumping as surface water availability continues to decline erban and gorelick 2016 minderhoud et al 2017 therefore there is a growing need as well as an interest to improve our understanding of groundwater processes especially through process based modeling however major challenges remain due to the complexity of groundwater system cuthbert et al 2019 fan et al 2019 2007 gleeson et al 2016 groundwater dynamics is modulated by a variety of regional to local hydrological processes that are intricately interconnected and governed by climatic drivers topographic controls and hydrogeological characteristics cuthbert et al 2019 thus groundwater research poses unique challenges compared to the study of surface water and it is exceedingly difficult to assess and predict the changes in groundwater systems especially over large scales condon maxwell 2015 engdahl 2017 sophocleous 2002 observational data challenges make groundwater research even more daunting evans et al 2020 megdal et al 2015 which is particularly true for modeling studies that require such data both to constrain and validate the models especially

based representation of surface and subsurface hydrological processes including infiltration soil moisture dynamics and groundwater recharge making these models more robust and feasible for application in different regions and climates especially in data limited basins such as the mrb koirala et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2014 de graaf et al 2015 gleeson et al 2021 furthermore lsms offer promising avenues for future research on land atmosphere coupling enabling an improved understanding of the dynamic interactions between groundwater and the atmosphere and more broadly within the entire earth system clark et al 2015 as such many large scale groundwater modeling studies use lsms account for groundwater in a relatively simple manner or with minimal groundwater parametrizations koirala et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2016 despite the challenges in representing groundwater in lsms due to data scarcity among others notable progress has been made toward improved groundwater parameterizations some of the noteworthy advances include the representation of linear groundwater reservoir fenicia et al 2006 surface water groundwater interactions fan and schaller 2009 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and kollet 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012a 2012b lateral groundwater flow barlage et al 2021 de graaf and stahl 2022 felfelani et al 2021 zeng et al 2018 and groundwater pumping for irrigation de graaf et al 2019 felfelani et al 2021 leng et al 2014 nie et al 2018 pokhrel et al 2012 2015 wada et al 2010 these efforts have led to groundwater representations with varying degree of complexity in different lsms including the variable infiltration capacity model vic liang et al 2003 matsiro pokhrel et al 2015 community land model clm kluzek 2013 lawrence et al 2019 oleson et al 2013 swenson et al 2019 and noah mp nie et al 2018 however most of these model development studies have focused on data rich regions such as the us aquifer systems where groundwater is depleting alarmingly due to rapidly increased pumping for irrigation maxwell et al 2015 nie et al 2019 2021 2022 pokhrel et al 2015 leaving major gaps that come with challenges toward using the models in regions where groundwater issues are rapidly emerging but data are scarce jayakumar and lee 2017 the mrb is a perfect example of such regions where upstream water management dang et al 2016 galelli et al 2022 hecht et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2018a climate change and variability arias et al 2012 delgado et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 and increased groundwater pumping for domestic and irrigation uses are rapidly transforming groundwater dynamics but basin scale groundwater modeling studies are rare if not non existent dang et al 2016 johnston and kummu 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a primarily because of the basin wide data limitations to constrain and validate the model erban et al 2014 erban and gorelick 2016 very crucially leaving the growing anthropogenic influence aside even the natural dynamics of groundwater systems especially over the entire mrb is not adequately studied lacombe et al 2017 further growing number of observational studies have reported dramatic shifts in groundwater systems over the lower mrb lmrb especially the mekong delta region due to the influence of growing anthropogenic activates over the past decade duy et al 2021 haddeland et al 2006 kazama et al 2007 lee et al 2017 loc et al 2021 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 tu et al 2022a few studies investigated the historical groundwater situation at the sub catchment level of the mrb under the influence of climate change irrigation and groundwater extraction gunnink et al 2021 hoanh et al 2012 shrestha et al 2016 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 other studies underlined the critical issues such as groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion in the mekong delta and contaminant transport that is directly linked with groundwater flow and groundwater depletion minderhoud et al 2017 tran et al 2022 however no basin scale groundwater study exists and process based models have been rarely used to simulate these changes resolve the interactions among various governing processes and identify the key drivers johnston and kummu 2012 fundamentally little advancement has been made in understanding the critical controls of climate physiography and anthropogenic drivers on the dynamics of groundwater over the mrb such lack of basin scale groundwater modeling considering climatic and anthropogenic drivers critically hinders the understanding of evolving groundwater systems over the mrb with implications on reliable future projections of water resource availability and use under climate change and intensified anthropogenic activities jasechko et al 2014 some global modeling studies have examined water and energy balances over the mrb e g haddeland et al 2006 lacombe et al 2017 tatsumi yamashiki 2015 felfelani et al 2017 however they have applied global models at a relatively coarse spatial resolution e g 50 100 km not accounting for finer scale processes including lateral flow e g felfelani et al 2021 krakauer et al 2014 that are crucial in governing groundwater dynamics in the mrb s landscapes with high climatic topographic and hydrogeologic gradients cooper 2010 hung et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a lastly while some sub basin scale studies have provided insights on local scale groundwater changes basin scale and long term e g decadal evolutions changes and patterns of groundwater dynamics for the mrb are largely lacking here we address the gaps identified above by focusing on the following three scientific contributions and to advance groundwater modeling over the mrb first we present a fully distributed and process based lsm for the mrb which simulates key hydrological processes on a full physical basis including improved parameterizations for inter grid lateral groundwater flow and aquifer pumping second we use the model for a mechanistic investigation of interactions among the processes governing surface water and groundwater flows including groundwater recharge and discharge considering basin scale climatic drivers and human activities and encompassing relatively fine scale process heterogeneities third despite dearth of data to fully constrain the model we present first order quantification of the effects of increased irrigation and groundwater pumping on groundwater flow processes and storage dynamics over the lmrb we are aware of the challenges and more so of the pressing need to improve our ability to simulate groundwater dynamics at the basin scale over the mrb the primary goal is to capture the basin scale patterns of groundwater dynamics and quantify the human induced changes in groundwater systems the underlying objective is to provide a foundational framework for basin wide groundwater studies in the mrb considering key governing processes and their response to the major climatic and human factors such a framework is expected to advance the current state of groundwater modeling in the mrb and open avenues for further research including model enhancements we address the following scientific questions 1 how do climatic drivers physiographic conditions and topographic characteristics govern groundwater processes specifically recharge discharge and lateral flow across the mrb 2 what role does groundwater dynamics across the mrb play in modulating surface water systems in the lmrb 3 how are anthropogenic activities specifically irrigation and groundwater pumping impacting groundwater systems in the lmrb the model we use is the community land model version 5 clm5 with the latest updates on groundwater parameterizations see section 2 2 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the mrb is shared by six countries in southeast asia china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam mrc 2005 the upper mrb umrb is characterized by a steep narrow valley with its geometry determined primarily by himalayan orogeny carling 2009 the lmrb can be divided into four regions i the northern highlands characterized by high elevation and dense vegetation ii the khorat plateau that includes much of the lowlands and a relatively flat landscape iii the tonle sap basin and iv the mekong delta with an alluvial floodplain lacombe et al 2017 the northern highlands include the north of thailand and laos and extend into vietnam the khorat plateau covers most of northeast thailand with its northern and eastern margin in central laos and has a consistent basin elevation farther downstream tonle sap lake tsl covers the southern portion of laos and most of cambodia the climate across the mrb is tropical monsoonal precipitation patterns are seasonal with the majority of annual totals occurring during the wet season between may and october kabir et al 2022 the highest rainfall of over 2500 mm yr occurs in the highlands of laos and the lowest of less than 1000 mm yr over the khorat plateau in northeast thailand mrb is characterized by dense forest coverage towards the north and crop areas in the lmrb and mekong delta towards the south fig 1 surface water has historically been the dominant water resource for irrigation however over the past two decades household wells and large scale deeper pumping for municipal and industrial purposes including irrigation have risen substantially hoanh et al 2014 currently there are over one million wells in the mekong delta gunnink et al 2021 hoanh et al 2014 loc et al 2021 minderhoud et al 2017 and the interest in further expanding the use of groundwater for agriculture is increasing tran et al 2022 2 2 model we use clm5 which is the land component of the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 that resolves various surface and subsurface hydrological processes e g soil and plant hydrology snow physics river routing crop modeling coupled with energy and biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles on a complete physical basis danabasoglu et al 2020 although clm5 and similar lsms were traditionally designed to simulate surface water and energy fluxes within the earth system model esm frameworks major advances have been made in recent years to represent sub surface hydrological processes haddeland et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2016 for example clm5 simulates key subsurface processes including infiltration plant hydraulics soil moisture dynamics and groundwater that drive groundwater recharge on a full physical basis clark et al 2015 kennedy et al 2019 lawrence et al 2019 highly detailed groundwater models require extensive data and are exceedingly challenging to implement in the mrb whereas simplistic process representation in parsimonious or lumped models can lead to uncertainties when hydrological processes are highly nonlinear or dynamic paniconi and putti 2015 thus we use clm5 striking a balance between data requirements and process representation and opening an opportunity to overcome the data challenge the standard clm5 includes a subsurface hydrology scheme with only a vertical exchange of water lawrence et al 2019 swenson et al 2019 we use an advanced model version that includes the representation of lateral flow and aquifer pumping to account for the consumptive use of water for irrigation felfelani et al 2021 the lateral groundwater flow is represented by darcy s law following fan et al 2007 while the pumping scheme is based on higw mat model pokhrel et al 2015 the lateral flow is driven primarily by groundwater head difference influenced by factors such as climate and topography i e topographic slope in baseflow generation between two adjacent cells and computed based on darcy s law fan and li 2013 as q n w t h n h c l where hn and hc are the hydraulic head in nth neighbor and center grid cells respectively t is the transmissivity l is the distance between cells and w δ x 0 5 tan π 8 is the width of an imaginary octagon that replaces the square grid cell to provide an equal chance for all eight neighboring cells to interact with the center cell felfelani et al 2021 when water table lies within the soil layer the positive net lateral flow is added to soil layers in sequential order beginning from the soil layer right above the water table and the negative net lateral flow is removed from soil layers in sequential order beginning from the soil layer right below the water table any residual is taken from the underlying aquifer layer felfelani et al 2021 when the water table is below the soil column the net lateral flow is added removed to from the aquifer storage felfelani et al 2021 further details of the lateral flow and mass balance of each grid cell can be found in felfelani et al 2021 in clm5 soil hydrologic processes are explicitly resolved up to 8 5 m depth and water table depth can vary from 0 to 80 m felfelani et al 2021 the subsurface is depicted using a high vertical resolution and improved solution to the richard s equation to resolve soil water movement across layers felfelani et al 2021 when unconfined aquifer under the soil column is activated drainage from the lowest soil layer recharge q rech is controlled by a head based lower boundary condition i e q rech q i θ liqi q i θ liqi here q i is the water flux across the lowest interface and θ q liqi is the liquid volumetric soil moisture when the water table is within the soil column recharge rate is determined using darcy s equation across the water table in this configuration subsurface runoff decays exponentially depending on the water table depth zwt that is q sub θ ice q drai m a x exp f drai z wt where θ ice is ice impedance factor q drai m a x is the maximum subsurface runoff when z wt 0 and is set to q drai m a x 10 sin β β is the mean grid cell topographic slope in radians and f drai is the decay factor f drai is determined globally but can be calibrated to improve subsurface runoff simulations and streamflow at the regional scale 2 2 1 subsurface hydrologic parameters hydraulic properties of the soil are weighted combinations of the mineral properties determined based on sand and clay contents clapp and hornberger 1978 cosby et al 1984 and organic properties of the soil lawrence and slater 2008 hydraulic conductivity is defined at the depth of the interface between two adjacent soil layers and is a function of saturated hydraulic conductivity the liquid volumetric soil moisture of the two layers and an ice impedance factor θice ncar 2019 note that the lateral hydraulic conductivity k lat is determined from the vertical hydraulic conductivity k ver resolved in the vertical one dimensional soil movement and percent of clay in the soil layer represents the anisotropy factor i e c clay k lat k ver as described in fan et al 2007 and zeng et al 2016 the prognostic aquifer transmissivity t is estimated based on the water table depth and hydraulic conductivity fan et al 2007 if water table depth lies within the soil column t t1 t2 where t1 is the transmissivity of the saturated portion of the soil column i e from the water table to the bottom most layer and t2 is the transmissivity of the depth below the bottom most layer felfelani et al 2021 here t2 is estimated using hydraulic conductivity of the bottom most layer exponentially decayed with depth a more in depth discussion on the aquifer transmissivity estimation can be found in felfelani et al 2021 and fan et al 2007 2 2 2 irrigation parameterizations irrigation application is dynamically responsive to the simulated soil moisture conditions ozdogan et al 2010 when irrigation is enabled the crop areas of each grid cell are divided into irrigated and rainfed fractions based on a dataset of areas equipped for irrigation portmann et al 2010 irrigated and rainfed crops are placed on separate soil columns and irrigation is applied only to the irrigated portion in irrigated croplands a check is conducted once per day in the first time step after 6 am local time to determine whether irrigation is required on that day irrigation is triggered if crop leaf area index 0 and the available soil moisture is below a specified threshold felfelani et al 2018 in the standard clm5 irrigation water is applied to the soil column as an add on to precipitation withdrawing water from surface water i e water in the main river channel as a sole source of irrigation ncar 2019 in the improved version of clm5 used in this study groundwater supplied fraction provided in the model as input data is extracted from the groundwater from the aquifer or from the soil layers when water table is within soil column and rest of the irrigation water requirement is withdrawn from the main channel felfelani et al 2021 this model version is validated in continental us and found to adequately capture the subsurface dynamics as well as groundwater depletion felfelani et al 2021 adding confidence on the use of the model in other basin such as the mrb 2 2 3 surface water routing to simulate streamflow we use model for scale adaptive river transport mosart a process based model that uses kinematic wave formulations to route runoff as described in li et al 2015 the model uses a hydrography dataset available globally at a spatial resolution of 0 125 topographic parameters such as flow direction channel length and channel slope were obtained using the dominant river tracking drt algorithm li et al 2015 mosart is the standard river routing scheme employed in clm5 2 3 data we use watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim reanalysis wfdei global meteorological forcing data at 0 5 spatial resolution and 3 hour timely intervals weedon et al 2014 wfdei has been widely used in the lsm based studies pinnington et al 2018 and sensitivity analysis on the mrb by kabir et al 2022 suggests that wfdei reproduce observed hydrological fluxes and states including streamflow terrestrial water storage tws and soil moisture in the mrb better than many other high resolution climate forcing datasets we utilize the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp soil data to define soil characteristics at different soil layers we utilize the global map of irrigated areas version 5 gmiav5 siebert et al 2015 for circa 2005 available at 0 083 spatial resolution figure s1 to specify the contribution of groundwater to total irrigation water withdrawals in the mrb fractional groundwater contribution varies substantially ranging from 0 to 25 and with most groundwater irrigation areas found in northern thailand figure s1 irrigation is predominantly surface water based in other parts of the basin the equilibrium water table depth i e climatologic mean that represents the long term balance between the climate driven recharge and the topography driven lateral flow fan et al 2013 aggregated to 0 05 resolution is used to initialize the water table depth in clm5 to reduce the spin up period zeng et al 2018 we use observed streamflow data from the mekong river commission mrc to validate streamflow simulations at six gauging locations across the basin to validate tws we use monthly gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data two mass concentration mascon solutions from the center for space research csr save et al 2016 at the university of texas at austin and jet propulsion laboratory jpl watkins et al 2014 at california institute of technology are used to validate soil moisture we use the data from soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission entekhabi et al 2015 ground based soil moisture data are not available for the mrb there are no basin scale data available to reasonably validate simulated groundwater table thus we used the synthesized data by digitizing the data published in the previous literature tiwari et al 2023 2 4 experimental settings we conduct four simulations with varied settings and time periods table 1 over the mrb at 0 05 spatial resolution 5 km first a multi decadal simulation is performed without considering irrigation and pumping i e natural state referred to as the control ctrl simulation this simulation is used to investigate the mrb s natural groundwater dynamics and its climatic and physiographic controls then we conduct three additional simulations with varying irrigation water use scenarios to investigate the role of irrigation and groundwater pumping in perturbing groundwater dynamics the ctrl simulation is first spun up for 100 years by using wfdei forcing data repeatedly for the year 1979 rodell et al 2005 the ctrl simulation is performed without activating irrigation and pumping the ctrl sw is based on ctrl but activating irrigation where full irrigation demand is met from surface water sources sim gwsw is based on ctrl with irrigation and groundwater pumping activated for conjunctive use from surface and groundwater sim gw simulation represents a situation where the irrigation demand is met solely from groundwater since widespread irrigation in the mrb began in the 1990 s we conduct sim gwsw and sim gw simulations for a shorter period beginning in 2000 head based lower boundary condition and lateral flow are active in all simulations the experiments are designed to capture the natural groundwater dynamics of the mrb and the potential consequences of anthropogenic impacts such as irrigation and groundwater pumping 3 results 3 1 surface and subsurface water variations comparison of the simulated monthly streamflow with observations at six gauging stations across the lmrb indicates that the model performs well in capturing the temporal dynamics of streamflow and its seasonality correlation coefficient ranges between 0 8 and 0 99 and nse ranges between 0 7 and 0 95 across various stations given minimal precipitation during the dry season in the mrb hung et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a sun et al 2021 groundwater discharge is arguably the primary contributor to streamflow particularly during this period thus and given that no extensive basin wide data exist for a direct groundwater validation we focus on the evaluation of low flow indicators that serve as a proxy of groundwater discharge i e baseflow simulations yeh and eltahir 2005 along with a limited validation of simulated water table anomaly with observations in general flows having 85 90 and 95 percent exceedance probability i e q85 q90 and q95 respectively are simulated reasonably well across all stations fig 2 a f the mean percent deviation mpd of simulated and observed q95 q90 and q85 ranges between 4 and 8 1 5 10 and 1 5 11 respectively these comparisons of annual and low flows as well as the temporal patterns suggest that the model reasonably simulates low flow hence the underlying groundwater discharge or baseflow generation the temporal pattern of the simulated groundwater table anomaly represents a comparatively stable trend unlike the observed water table changes in the mrb that depict a continuous decline from 2007 to 2016 this can be attributed to various factors including limitations in process representation both natural and anthropogenic specifically it is likely that the model does not capture the full range of groundwater dynamics driven by local scale processes that are reflected in the point measurements of groundwater table nevertheless the model captures the declining trend of water table depletion including some of the major water table decline in 2010 and 2014 despite certain discrepancies in the magnitude fig 2i k the model also captures some of the observed water table recoveries fig 2k the findings indicate that the model can reasonably capture the observed groundwater anomaly and inter annual dynamics of groundwater changes we note that a direct comparison between the water table derived from a 5 km model grid and very limited point scale observations is not fully compatible thus these evaluations should be interpreted with sufficient caution further there could be added uncertainties due to climate forcing particularly precipitation kabir et al 2022 subsurface parameterization notably baseflow and insufficient representation of the groundwater irrigation areas that can lead to underestimation of water table decline most importantly the validation locations are predominantly located in the mekong delta where groundwater can be influenced by sea water intrusion and tides factors currently not accounted for in the model however due to high data paucity e g lack of basin wide continuous monitoring of groundwater levels this is the only viable evaluation of our simulations in addition to the validation of discharge and tws figs 2 and 3 given complex topographic features across the mrb use of a global scale lsm and limited data to constrain process simulations we consider these results to be satisfactory to study groundwater processes over the mrb similar to streamflow clm5 well simulates the temporal variations of basin averaged tws anomaly fig 3 it is evident from fig 3 that the temporal variability is accurately reproduced along with the historical dry wet transitions compared to grace observations i e shaded areas in fig 3a the good agreement with grace is evident not only visually but also statistically as indicated by a high r2 0 96 and low root mean square error rmse 21 2 mm however the model did miss some of the events such as in 2002 and 2011 two notable flood years in the mrb chinh et al 2016 dushmanta et al 2007 and the simulated peak is slightly underestimated some of these underestimations and discrepancies are likely caused by limitations inherent in the model such as absence of explicit representations of floodplain storage particularly in the lmrb pokhrel et al 2018 this limitation could have a noticeable impact on certain years particularly those characterized by flood events we find that subsurface storage plays a critical role in modulating the total tws variations and hence the hydrology of the mrb fig 3a b notably subsurface storage accounts for 81 of tws amplitude while groundwater anomaly explains 65 of the tws anomaly in the mrb subtracting soil moisture anomaly from the tws anomaly about 15 of the seasonal tws amplitude is explained by surface water storage fig 3b pie chart in line with the findings of previous studies pokhrel et al 2018b that reported this contribution to be 13 based on a global lsm higw mat that is similar to clm5 in process representation because grace provides the vertically integrated total tws not individual components groundwater and surface water contribution could not be individually validated and there are no other similar modeling studies for the entire mrb to cross compare these individual tws components the comparison of seasonal tws anomaly with grace data reveals that the overall seasonal variation is simulated reasonably well fig 3c j furthermore the broad spatial pattern of the basin wide seasonal tws anomaly is consistent with the grace data however some discrepancies are evident in the lmrb likely due to uncertainty in precipitation kabir et al 2022 in addition to model parameterizations the ability to perform a more in depth comparison with grace data is limited because of the inconsistency in spatial resolution between model and grace data we further compare simulated soil moisture with smap observations figure s4 broad arid and humid contrasts of the soil moisture across the basin are reasonably reproduced in the simulation there are however some disagreements in the wet season september november likely due to precipitation uncertainty kabir et al 2022 or uncertainties in smap data e g vegetation cover affects smap signal colliander et al 2020 ma et al 2017 these evaluations of tws and soil moisture indicate that clm5 simulates the subsurface hydrodynamics of the mrb reasonably well and could be used to examine the mechanistic interactions of the groundwater processes additionally dominance of subsurface storage variation on tws anomaly indicates a strong control of groundwater in mrb s water cycle and hence highlight the importance of improving groundwater processes understanding 3 2 groundwater flow patterns and drivers simulated annual average groundwater recharge in the mrb has distinct spatial variability ranging from less than 100 mm yr to over 1 000 mm yr with recharge rates generally decreasing from the umrb to the lmrb fig 4 a high recharge rates are simulated in regions deep blue color in fig 4a where precipitation rates are generally high laos and vietnam are two such regions with high groundwater recharge and discharge rates some regions in the lmrb s floodplains are evident with net negative groundwater recharge capillary rise likely under shallow groundwater conditions i e groundwater responds to soil moisture stress and contributes to evapotranspiration et as expected groundwater discharge follows similar spatial patterns of recharge fig 4b however some areas with high recharge and low discharge rates are simulated zoomed boxes in fig 4a and 4b suggesting that small scale variations in soil characteristics and topographical factors govern regional groundwater flow and redistribute recharge spatially to provide further insights on relatively smaller scale processes and responses we examine the basin wide recharge to precipitation rs p ratio fig 5 a and surface and subsurface fluxes in different regions across the mrb fig 5b m that represent diverse topography climate soil and vegetation characteristics high precipitation during the wet season june september is observed in locations b c and e similarly high recharge and groundwater discharge are evident in these regions with similar magnitude and climatological patterns these regions in the umrb are dominated by dense natural vegetation figure s5 and sandy soil deposits 60 sand content figure s6 that favor precipitation infiltrating and generating high groundwater recharge fig 5b d thus high rs p i e rs p between 40 and 50 is observed fig 5b d in addition to soil and vegetation characteristics the high climatic and topographic gradient affects groundwater flow that drives discharge to the surrounding valley regions however there is no linear correlation between groundwater recharge and discharge with the topographic slope other possible factors such as low water table gradient and relatively homogeneous soil texture dominated mainly by sandy soil deposits figure s6 affect direct recharge and discharge impeding regional groundwater flow in contrast relatively downstream towards the lmrb fig 5f g rs p is rather high however relatively low discharge indicates possible control of local to regional scale groundwater flow topographic slope soil characteristics and water table gradient are likely to affect the divergence of groundwater discharge fig 5f g furthermore more heterogeneous soil composition is observed in these regions figure s6 which acts as the critical factor in controlling groundwater flow for example in the intermediate soil layers figure s6 layers 6 10 there is more heterogeneity in soil texture to impact groundwater flow paths relative control of regional flow owing to differences in topographic slope as well as heterogeneous soil characteristics is evident in the mountainous regions in the mrb fig 5e g farther downstream in the lmrb floodplains fig 5h j rs p is relatively low in the order of 10 likely because the soil composition alluvial clay is 60 of the soil composition inhibits quick percolation and recharge precipitation intensity is moderate in the lmrb floodplains also in the wet season relatively high soil moisture in the lmrb figure s4 can create soil saturation near the surface that virtually makes the soil impermeable and cause less recharge than in other regions fig 5b g in addition there is consistently high et that leads to low groundwater recharge in comparison to the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil fig 6 therefore despite the high or moderate precipitation rate a relatively low recharge rate is evident thus soil characteristics has a critical control over the groundwater flow in the lmrb floodplains besides the low gradient in the water table influenced by flat topography in the lmrb floodplains controls the groundwater flow in this region rs p varies in the mekong delta ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 like the floodplain in the lmrb high clay content in the soil inhibits groundwater recharge in the mekong delta one primary reason for low recharge could be the presence of shallow clay layers figure s6 which act as a confining layer limiting recharge similar findings in the mekong delta have also been reported by tu et al 2022 overall climatic and physiographic conditions along with soil characteristics play a crucial role in governing recharge and discharge we note that we do not simulate the effects of dams and reservoirs that could influence groundwater recharge in the areas with substantial water impoundment the ratio of basin wide discharge to recharge qg rs provides further insight into the groundwater flow pathways and the impacts of the basin wide water budget a vast majority of the basin area indicated as different shades of blue color in fig 4c is a groundwater receiver suggesting that groundwater a dominant component of the basin wide water budget in the lmrb overall groundwater recharge and discharge zones follow the mrb s north to south and east to west topographic and climatic gradients 3 3 climatic control of groundwater flow high recharge and discharge zones are generally located in areas with high annual precipitation and are strongly influenced by precipitation climatology basin averaged recharge rate peaks above 100 mm in august the middle of the wet season in the mrb fig 4d and fig 6 in contrast recharge drops below 40 mm during the onset of the dry season in november about 73 of annual recharge occurs between july and september during which 40 of annual precipitation occurs fig 4d and figure s7 precipitation and recharge in the basin are highly correlated r2 0 71 suggesting a strong climate control on groundwater variations across the basin the average recharge to rainfall ratio is 34 annually and substantially higher during the wet season 52 than during the dry season 6 indicating that rainfall seasonality plays a crucial role in governing annual groundwater recharge therefore wet season rainfall substantially contributes to groundwater replenishment and can potentially buffer subsurface storage during drought this is well studied and known in the amazon river basin miguez macho and fan 2012a 2012b pokhrel et al 2013 but remains largely unexamined in the mrb 3 4 role of groundwater in surface water dynamics and governing drivers groundwater discharge over the mrb is simulated to be 401 mm yr accounting for over 50 of annual river discharge fig 5 groundwater recharge and discharge peaks occur during the wet season with a 1 2 month delayed and dampened response to precipitation fig 5b h and fig 6 a shorter time lag between precipitation and infiltration is observed in the umrb which is characterized by sandy soil deposits that enhance rapid infiltration particularly during heavy rain events generally we observe longer response time and high spatial variability toward the lmrb alluvial floodplains fig 6 groundwater recharge and discharge have a 2 3 month delayed response to infiltration and precipitation in the lmrb allowing groundwater recharge to carry over to the subsequent season and acts as a critical source of baseflow to rivers to maintain dry season flow also comparable magnitude of basin scale groundwater discharge and total runoff over the entire dry period november may further underscores that groundwater supports the bulk of the total streamflow and its seasonal variation essentially governs surface water fluxes fig 6 further a substantially higher negative rs p during the dry season fig 5f and 5i suggests that groundwater storage significantly contributes to augmenting soil moisture and et particularly in the lmrb some regions are evident where a negative rs p ratio is observed for consecutive 3 4 months after the offset of the wet season in september fig 5e g suggesting that groundwater responds to soil moisture deficit for a considerable period when precipitation is low basin wide negative recharge during december to may further indicates that groundwater acts as a basin wide soil moisture buffer to support dry season soil moisture and et fig 6 implying that groundwater dynamics has a far reaching influence on the water and energy cycle in the mrb overall the interaction between groundwater and surface water in the mrb is regulated by a complex set of drivers including seasonal variations in precipitation soil properties and topography the impacts of human activities such as irrigation and groundwater pumping are discussed in the later section notably the results are simulation based and depend on a variety of model parameterizations such as soil layer configurations subsurface parameterizations and input datasets used all of which are subject to certain degree of uncertainty which all can affect simulation outcomes however our results provide detailed insights on the different groundwater processes from surface infiltration to the subsurface groundwater discharge leading to a mechanistic understanding on the dynamic interactions among the tightly coupled surface water groundwater processes across the mrb 3 5 groundwater flow impacted by aquifer pumping finally we examine how increased groundwater pumping for irrigation impacts groundwater systems in the mrb we specifically quantify the changes in groundwater flow and water table depth caused by increased aquifer pumping for dry season irrigation we focus on the mekong delta region that accounts for the majority of irrigated crops and where widespread irrigation is increasing in recent years in other parts of the mrb agricultural systems are mostly rainfed figure s8 the simulated annual irrigation demand in the mrb varies from 25 to over 250 mm fig 7 a in some portions of the mekong delta irrigation demand is relatively high for example up to 200 mm yr fig 7a and these results are consistent with previous estimates reported in global scale studies for year 2010 wada et al 2016 irrigation validation could be further enhanced by using satellite based datasets i e brocca et al 2018 koch et al 2020 however our results should be interpreted with caution because of possible uncertainties arising from the uncertainty in climate forcing and irrigation datasets used further there could be under representation of the recent irrigation development that is likely to cause an underestimated groundwater withdrawal a more in depth evaluation is not possible because of the lack of spatially explicit datasets on irrigation withdrawals in the mrb irrigation pumping imposes a water table gradient causing up to half a meter of water table decline in the mekong delta fig 8 a in general when averaged over a long period the simulated effect of groundwater pumping is not substantial even in the mekong delta especially in comparison to that in other major agricultural regions worldwide this is so even when irrigation demand is met from the groundwater resource i e sim gw simulation since irrigation development in the mrb is relatively recent i e it started a few decades ago long term climate variability balances the pumping effects however widespread storage depletion is simulated in the mekong delta during the selected dry years i e 2005 and 2015 the depletion is more than double in pumping cells in 2005 and 2015 compared to the long term average water level decline and substantially large area of depletion is readily discernible fig 8b c depletion reaches 1 m at the center of the mekong delta and 0 5 m at the borders during 2005 under the increased influence of groundwater pumping sim gw simulation these results are consistent with previous estimates reported by regional scale studies on the mekong delta although the simulated absolute depletion may be underestimated because the information on the recent increase in groundwater pumping for irrigation minderhoud et al 2020 2017 is not accounted for in our model water table gradient induces a shift in groundwater flow in the mekong delta fig 8b c notably during dry years the decline in water table fig 8b drives large flow towards the pumping cells from the surrounding resulting in an increase in groundwater discharge in the neighboring cells in sim gw simulation positive difference compared to the ctrl simulation fig 8e f such pumping induced alterations of groundwater dynamics particularly during dry years imply that groundwater depletion in the mekong delta could be exacerbated if prolonged droughts were to occur in the future the change in lateral groundwater flow based on signs further signifies the growing influence of irrigation and pumping on the region s groundwater systems fig 7c d for instance red cells in fig 7c lateral outflow turn blue lateral inflow due to the pumping induced head gradient that triggers a substantial lateral flow towards the cone of depression red blob fig 8b in general groundwater withdrawals are likely to be unsustainable in the mekong delta if irrigation and pumping continue to expand in the future notably the model shows promising potential to simulate irrigation and its influence on groundwater and in identifying depletion hotspots however it is important to note that local scale phenomena such as cone of depression resulting from pumping induced water table gradient may not have been captured adequately at the current spatial resolution i e 5 km 4 conclusion this study examines groundwater mechanisms governing processes and the interactions between groundwater and surface water under natural conditions and anthropogenic influences over the mrb using a fully distributed and process based lsm with improved groundwater representation that accounts for lateral groundwater flow and aquifer pumping results are first validated with observed streamflow water table grace based tws and smap based soil moisture data then used to examine groundwater flow processes across the mrb the governing mechanism and the effects of increasing irrigation activities on groundwater systems in the lmrb the following summarizes the key findings of the study first groundwater flow in the mrb exhibits high spatially heterogeneities driven by a combination of factors including regional topography climate and local or regional scale subsurface characteristics the climate precipitation intensity and seasonality has a first order control on recharge and discharge variations across the basin further regional subsurface characteristics dominantly control the recharge dynamics especially in the lmrb second in the lmrb groundwater is the dominant source of streamflow and its spatial variation and seasonality strongly modulate surface water dynamics in some regions groundwater perennially feeds streamflow this mechanism is highlighted using an in depth analysis over selected regions across the mrb with varying climatic hydrologic and geologic characteristics third groundwater storage acts as a hydrological buffer and contributes substantially to soil moisture and et for a considerable period of the year these findings suggest a strong control of groundwater dynamics on the mrb s surface water and energy balances with potential implications of perturbing the natural groundwater dynamics on surface water and energy fluxes fourth groundwater use for irrigation has not had notable impact on groundwater dynamics over the long term but the model simulates a region wide storage depletion in the mekong delta during dry years resulting in a shift in groundwater dynamics also altering the magnitude and direction of groundwater discharge and lateral flow we note that our results are based on model simulations and may include uncertainties arising for example from forcing data model resolution and imperfect groundwater parameterizations thus the results should be interpreted with caution particularly for local scale implications of groundwater depletion hotspots and cone of depression further the irrigation and groundwater data we used are from global databases which may not include the most recent developments in groundwater irrigation potentially underestimating the irrigation induced changes in groundwater in the mekong delta our study offers a detailed discussion on the natural groundwater dynamics in the mrb as well as the potential impacts of irrigation development and groundwater withdrawal a more comprehensive understanding of the groundwater dynamics in the mrb could require consideration of dams and reservoir operation in the simulation which forms a potential avenue for future research future studies could address these limitations by further refining model parameterizations particularly for subsurface runoff improving process representation and using any new datasets despite certain limitations this study provides the first results on groundwater modeling for the entire mrb and by using a process based lsm that includes a prognostic groundwater scheme and aquifer pumping for irrigation our study also advances groundwater modeling

1794,groundwater depletion is a worldwide concern and an emerging issue in regions such as the mekong river basin mrb however even the natural dynamics of groundwater in the mrb is yet to be fully explored making the quantification of groundwater response to climate variability and anthropogenic activities a major scientific challenge here we examine various groundwater mechanisms in the mrb focusing on groundwater flow processes that are modulated by climate variability physiographic features and key drivers of groundwater surface water interactions we further quantify the influence of anthropogenic activities on groundwater dynamics we use the community land model version 5 clm5 at 0 05 5km spatial resolution with an improved representation of groundwater processes including lateral groundwater flow and aquifer pumping for irrigation results indicate high spatial heterogeneity in groundwater recharge and discharge across the basin governed by climate and subsurface characteristics a pronounced seasonality is found in groundwater recharge due to precipitation 52 of wet season precipitation recharges groundwater with substantial carryover to the consecutive dry season that alleviates soil moisture importantly groundwater discharge is a dominant source of streamflow all year round which suggests a strong surface water groundwater coupling in the mrb finally our results indicate that irrigation pumping is directly altering groundwater flows and storages climate variability smoothens pumping effects over long times but the model simulates region wide groundwater depletion up to 1 m year in the mekong delta during dry years our study provides key insights on the evolving groundwater systems in the mrb also advancing process based groundwater

miguez macho and fan 2012a it is the world s largest freshwater resource that supplies water to billions of people forms an integral part of irrigated agriculture and contributes to the health of many ecosystems siebert döll 2010 cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson et al 2012 at least one fourth of the world s population heavily relies on groundwater döll 2009 the dependence will likely continue to grow in the future due to the increase in population and associated demands for water especially agricultural siebert döll 2010 siebert et al 2015 agricultural irrigation which accounts for over 70 of the total freshwater withdrawal and 90 of the consumptive water use gleick 2018 shiklomanov 2000 is reliant heavily on groundwater in many global regions especially those with limited surface water hanasaki et al 2013 leng et al 2014 reinecke et al 2021 wada et al 2013 this reliance is expected to rise sharply owing to increased irrigation needs in relatively dry agricultural regions ambika and mishra 2019 crosbie et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2013 or even in relatively humid regions such as the mekong river basin mrb that are experiencing rapid agricultural intensification hoang et al 2019 nguyen et al 2012 sakamoto et al 2009 or increased groundwater pumping as surface water availability continues to decline erban and gorelick 2016 minderhoud et al 2017 therefore there is a growing need as well as an interest to improve our understanding of groundwater processes especially through process based modeling however major challenges remain due to the complexity of groundwater system cuthbert et al 2019 fan et al 2019 2007 gleeson et al 2016 groundwater dynamics is modulated by a variety of regional to local hydrological processes that are intricately interconnected and governed by climatic drivers topographic controls and hydrogeological characteristics cuthbert et al 2019 thus groundwater research poses unique challenges compared to the study of surface water and it is exceedingly difficult to assess and predict the changes in groundwater systems especially over large scales condon maxwell 2015 engdahl 2017 sophocleous 2002 observational data challenges make groundwater research even more daunting evans et al 2020 megdal et al 2015 which is particularly true for modeling studies that require such data both to constrain and validate the models especially in data limited regions even selecting an appropriate model can be challenging kumar et al 2021 tegegne et al 2017 parsimonious models are often used in such regions because of their simplicity and limited data requirements pande et al 2012 quichimbo et al 2021 however while parsimonious models could realistically simulate certain hydrologic variables under constrained conditions the models are not well suited to study process interactions and the complexities therein e g land use change vegetation processes soil hydrology fenicia et al 2011 wu et al 2010 especially considering that a system response to changing climatic and human drivers can be non linear mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 sivapalan et al 2002 conversely process based models e g land surface models lsms offer a more physically based representation of surface and subsurface hydrological processes including infiltration soil moisture dynamics and groundwater recharge making these models more robust and feasible for application in different regions and climates especially in data limited basins such as the mrb koirala et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2014 de graaf et al 2015 gleeson et al 2021 furthermore lsms offer promising avenues for future research on land atmosphere coupling enabling an improved understanding of the dynamic interactions between groundwater and the atmosphere and more broadly within the entire earth system clark et al 2015 as such many large scale groundwater modeling studies use lsms account for groundwater in a relatively simple manner or with minimal groundwater parametrizations koirala et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2016 despite the challenges in representing groundwater in lsms due to data scarcity among others notable progress has been made toward improved groundwater parameterizations some of the noteworthy advances include the representation of linear groundwater reservoir fenicia et al 2006 surface water groundwater interactions fan and schaller 2009 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and kollet 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012a 2012b lateral groundwater flow barlage et al 2021 de graaf and stahl 2022 felfelani et al 2021 zeng et al 2018 and groundwater pumping for irrigation de graaf et al 2019 felfelani et al 2021 leng et al 2014 nie et al 2018 pokhrel et al 2012 2015 wada et al 2010 these efforts have led to groundwater representations with varying degree of complexity in different lsms including the variable infiltration capacity model vic liang et al 2003 matsiro pokhrel et al 2015 community land model clm kluzek 2013 lawrence et al 2019 oleson et al 2013 swenson et al 2019 and noah mp nie et al 2018 however most of these model development studies have focused on data rich regions such as the us aquifer systems where groundwater is depleting alarmingly due to rapidly increased pumping for irrigation maxwell et al 2015 nie et al 2019 2021 2022 pokhrel et al 2015 leaving major gaps that come with challenges toward using the models in regions where groundwater issues are rapidly emerging but data are scarce jayakumar and lee 2017 the mrb is a perfect example of such regions where upstream water management dang et al 2016 galelli et al 2022 hecht et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2018a climate change and variability arias et al 2012 delgado et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 and increased groundwater pumping for domestic and irrigation uses are rapidly transforming groundwater dynamics but basin scale groundwater modeling studies are rare if not non existent dang et al 2016 johnston and kummu 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a primarily because of the basin wide data limitations to constrain and validate the model erban et al 2014 erban and gorelick 2016 very crucially leaving the growing anthropogenic influence aside even the natural dynamics of groundwater systems especially over the entire mrb is not adequately studied lacombe et al 2017 further growing number of observational studies have reported dramatic shifts in groundwater systems over the lower mrb lmrb especially the mekong delta region due to the influence of growing anthropogenic activates over the past decade duy et al 2021 haddeland et al 2006 kazama et al 2007 lee et al 2017 loc et al 2021 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 tu et al 2022a few studies investigated the historical groundwater situation at the sub catchment level of the mrb under the influence of climate change irrigation and groundwater extraction gunnink et al 2021 hoanh et al 2012 shrestha et al 2016 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 other studies underlined the critical issues such as groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion in the mekong delta and contaminant transport that is directly linked with groundwater flow and groundwater depletion minderhoud et al 2017 tran et al 2022 however no basin scale groundwater study exists and process based models have been rarely used to simulate these changes resolve the interactions among various governing processes and identify the key drivers johnston and kummu 2012 fundamentally little advancement has been made in understanding the critical controls of climate physiography and anthropogenic drivers on the dynamics of groundwater over the mrb such lack of basin scale groundwater modeling considering climatic and anthropogenic drivers critically hinders the understanding of evolving groundwater systems over the mrb with implications on reliable future projections of water resource availability and use under climate change and intensified anthropogenic activities jasechko et al 2014 some global modeling studies have examined water and energy balances over the mrb e g haddeland et al 2006 lacombe et al 2017 tatsumi yamashiki 2015 felfelani et al 2017 however they have applied global models at a relatively coarse spatial resolution e g 50 100 km not accounting for finer scale processes including lateral flow e g felfelani et al 2021 krakauer et al 2014 that are crucial in governing groundwater dynamics in the mrb s landscapes with high climatic topographic and hydrogeologic gradients cooper 2010 hung et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a lastly while some sub basin scale studies have provided insights on local scale groundwater changes basin scale and long term e g decadal evolutions changes and patterns of groundwater dynamics for the mrb are largely lacking here we address the gaps identified above by focusing on the following three scientific contributions and to advance groundwater modeling over the mrb first we present a fully distributed and process based lsm for the mrb which simulates key hydrological processes on a full physical basis including improved parameterizations for inter grid lateral groundwater flow and aquifer pumping second we use the model for a mechanistic investigation of interactions among the processes governing surface water and groundwater flows including groundwater recharge and discharge considering basin scale climatic drivers and human activities and encompassing relatively fine scale process heterogeneities third despite dearth of data to fully constrain the model we present first order quantification of the effects of increased irrigation and groundwater pumping on groundwater flow processes and storage dynamics over the lmrb we are aware of the challenges and more so of the pressing need to improve our ability to simulate groundwater dynamics at the basin scale over the mrb the primary goal is to capture the basin scale patterns of groundwater dynamics and quantify the human induced changes in groundwater systems the underlying objective is to provide a foundational framework for basin wide groundwater studies in the mrb considering key governing processes and their response to the major climatic and human factors such a framework is expected to advance the current state of groundwater modeling in the mrb and open avenues for further research including model enhancements we address the following scientific questions 1 how do climatic drivers physiographic conditions and topographic characteristics govern groundwater processes specifically recharge discharge and lateral flow across the mrb 2 what role does groundwater dynamics across the mrb play in modulating surface water systems in the lmrb 3 how are anthropogenic activities specifically irrigation and groundwater pumping impacting groundwater systems in the lmrb the model we use is the community land model version 5 clm5 with the latest updates on groundwater parameterizations see section 2 2 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the mrb is shared by six countries in southeast asia china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam mrc 2005 the upper mrb umrb is characterized by a steep narrow valley with its geometry determined primarily by himalayan orogeny carling 2009 the lmrb can be divided into four regions i the northern highlands characterized by high elevation and dense vegetation ii the khorat plateau that includes much of the lowlands and a relatively flat landscape iii the tonle sap basin and iv the mekong delta with an alluvial floodplain lacombe et al 2017 the northern highlands include the north of thailand and laos and extend into vietnam the khorat plateau covers most of northeast thailand with its northern and eastern margin in central laos and has a consistent basin elevation farther downstream tonle sap lake tsl covers the southern portion of laos and most of cambodia the climate across the mrb is tropical monsoonal precipitation patterns are seasonal with the majority of annual totals occurring during the wet season between may and october kabir et al 2022 the highest rainfall of over 2500 mm yr occurs in the highlands of laos and the lowest of less than 1000 mm yr over the khorat plateau in northeast thailand mrb is characterized by dense forest coverage towards the north and crop areas in the lmrb and mekong delta towards the south fig 1 surface water has historically been the dominant water resource for irrigation however over the past two decades household wells and large scale deeper pumping for municipal and industrial purposes including irrigation have risen substantially hoanh et al 2014 currently there are over one million wells in the mekong delta gunnink et al 2021 hoanh et al 2014 loc et al 2021 minderhoud et al 2017 and the interest in further expanding the use of groundwater for agriculture is increasing tran et al 2022 2 2 model we use clm5 which is the land component of the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 that resolves various surface and subsurface hydrological processes e g soil and plant hydrology snow physics river routing crop modeling coupled with energy and biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles on a complete physical basis danabasoglu et al 2020 although clm5 and similar lsms were traditionally designed to simulate surface water and energy fluxes within the earth system model esm frameworks major advances have been made in recent years to represent sub surface hydrological processes haddeland et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2016 for example clm5 simulates key subsurface processes including infiltration plant hydraulics soil moisture dynamics and groundwater that drive groundwater recharge on a full physical basis clark et al 2015 kennedy et al 2019 lawrence et al 2019 highly detailed groundwater models require extensive data and are exceedingly challenging to implement in the mrb whereas simplistic process representation in parsimonious or lumped models can lead to uncertainties when hydrological processes are highly nonlinear or dynamic paniconi and putti 2015 thus we use clm5 striking a balance between data requirements and process representation and opening an opportunity to overcome the data challenge the standard clm5 includes a subsurface hydrology scheme with only a vertical exchange of water lawrence et al 2019 swenson et al 2019 we use an advanced model version that includes the representation of lateral flow and aquifer pumping to account for the consumptive use of water for irrigation felfelani et al 2021 the lateral groundwater flow is represented by darcy s law following fan et al 2007 while the pumping scheme is based on higw mat model pokhrel et al 2015 the lateral flow is driven primarily by groundwater head difference influenced by factors such as climate and topography i e topographic slope in baseflow generation between two adjacent cells and computed based on darcy s law fan and li 2013 as q n w t h n h c l where hn and hc are the hydraulic head in nth neighbor and center grid cells respectively t is the transmissivity l is the distance between cells and w δ x 0 5 tan π 8 is the width of an imaginary octagon that replaces the square grid cell to provide an equal chance for all eight neighboring cells to interact with the center cell felfelani et al 2021 when water table lies within the soil layer the positive net lateral flow is added to soil layers in sequential order beginning from the soil layer right above the water table and the negative net lateral flow is removed from soil layers in sequential order beginning from the soil layer right below the water table any residual is taken from the underlying aquifer layer felfelani et al 2021 when the water table is below the soil column the net lateral flow is added removed to from the aquifer storage felfelani et al 2021 further details of the lateral flow and mass balance of each grid cell can be found in felfelani et al 2021 in clm5 soil hydrologic processes are explicitly resolved up to 8 5 m depth and water table depth can vary from 0 to 80 m felfelani et al 2021 the subsurface is depicted using a high vertical resolution and improved solution to the richard s equation to resolve soil water movement across layers felfelani et al 2021 when unconfined aquifer under the soil column is activated drainage from the lowest soil layer recharge q rech is controlled by a head based lower boundary condition i e q rech q i θ liqi q i θ liqi here q i is the water flux across the lowest interface and θ q liqi is the liquid volumetric soil moisture when the water table is within the soil column recharge rate is determined using darcy s equation across the water table in this configuration subsurface runoff decays exponentially depending on the water table depth zwt that is q sub θ ice q drai m a x exp f drai z wt where θ ice is ice impedance factor q drai m a x is the maximum subsurface runoff when z wt 0 and is set to q drai m a x 10 sin β β is the mean grid cell topographic slope in radians and f drai is the decay factor f drai is determined globally but can be calibrated to improve subsurface runoff simulations and streamflow at the regional scale 2 2 1 subsurface hydrologic parameters hydraulic properties of the soil are weighted combinations of the mineral properties determined based on sand and clay contents clapp and hornberger 1978 cosby et al 1984 and organic properties of the soil lawrence and slater 2008 hydraulic conductivity is defined at the depth of the interface between two adjacent soil layers and is a function of saturated hydraulic conductivity the liquid volumetric soil moisture of the two layers and an ice impedance factor θice ncar 2019 note that the lateral hydraulic conductivity k lat is determined from the vertical hydraulic conductivity k ver resolved in the vertical one dimensional soil movement and percent of clay in the soil layer represents the anisotropy factor i e c clay k lat k ver as described in fan et al 2007 and zeng et al 2016 the prognostic aquifer transmissivity t is estimated based on the water table depth and hydraulic conductivity fan et al 2007 if water table depth lies within the soil column t t1 t2 where t1 is the transmissivity of the saturated portion of the soil column i e from the water table to the bottom most layer and t2 is the transmissivity of the depth below the bottom most layer felfelani et al 2021 here t2 is estimated using hydraulic conductivity of the bottom most layer exponentially decayed with depth a more in depth discussion on the aquifer transmissivity estimation can be found in felfelani et al 2021 and fan et al 2007 2 2 2 irrigation parameterizations irrigation application is dynamically responsive to the simulated soil moisture conditions ozdogan et al 2010 when irrigation is enabled the crop areas of each grid cell are divided into irrigated and rainfed fractions based on a dataset of areas equipped for irrigation portmann et al 2010 irrigated and rainfed crops are placed on separate soil columns and irrigation is applied only to the irrigated portion in irrigated croplands a check is conducted once per day in the first time step after 6 am local time to determine whether irrigation is required on that day irrigation is triggered if crop leaf area index 0 and the available soil moisture is below a specified threshold felfelani et al 2018 in the standard clm5 irrigation water is applied to the soil column as an add on to precipitation withdrawing water from surface water i e water in the main river channel as a sole source of irrigation ncar 2019 in the improved version of clm5 used in this study groundwater supplied fraction provided in the model as input data is extracted from the groundwater from the aquifer or from the soil layers when water table is within soil column and rest of the irrigation water requirement is withdrawn from the main channel felfelani et al 2021 this model version is validated in continental us and found to adequately capture the subsurface dynamics as well as groundwater depletion felfelani et al 2021 adding confidence on the use of the model in other basin such as the mrb 2 2 3 surface water routing to simulate streamflow we use model for scale adaptive river transport mosart a process based model that uses kinematic wave formulations to route runoff as described in li et al 2015 the model uses a hydrography dataset available globally at a spatial resolution of 0 125 topographic parameters such as flow direction channel length and channel slope were obtained using the dominant river tracking drt algorithm li et al 2015 mosart is the standard river routing scheme employed in clm5 2 3 data we use watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim reanalysis wfdei global meteorological forcing data at 0 5 spatial resolution and 3 hour timely intervals weedon et al 2014 wfdei has been widely used in the lsm based studies pinnington et al 2018 and sensitivity analysis on the mrb by kabir et al 2022 suggests that wfdei reproduce observed hydrological fluxes and states including streamflow terrestrial water storage tws and soil moisture in the mrb better than many other high resolution climate forcing datasets we utilize the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp soil data to define soil characteristics at different soil layers we utilize the global map of irrigated areas version 5 gmiav5 siebert et al 2015 for circa 2005 available at 0 083 spatial resolution figure s1 to specify the contribution of groundwater to total irrigation water withdrawals in the mrb fractional groundwater contribution varies substantially ranging from 0 to 25 and with most groundwater irrigation areas found in northern thailand figure s1 irrigation is predominantly surface water based in other parts of the basin the equilibrium water table depth i e climatologic mean that represents the long term balance between the climate driven recharge and the topography driven lateral flow fan et al 2013 aggregated to 0 05 resolution is used to initialize the water table depth in clm5 to reduce the spin up period zeng et al 2018 we use observed streamflow data from the mekong river commission mrc to validate streamflow simulations at six gauging locations across the basin to validate tws we use monthly gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data two mass concentration mascon solutions from the center for space research csr save et al 2016 at the university of texas at austin and jet propulsion laboratory jpl watkins et al 2014 at california institute of technology are used to validate soil moisture we use the data from soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission entekhabi et al 2015 ground based soil moisture data are not available for the mrb there are no basin scale data available to reasonably validate simulated groundwater table thus we used the synthesized data by digitizing the data published in the previous literature tiwari et al 2023 2 4 experimental settings we conduct four simulations with varied settings and time periods table 1 over the mrb at 0 05 spatial resolution 5 km first a multi decadal simulation is performed without considering irrigation and pumping i e natural state referred to as the control ctrl simulation this simulation is used to investigate the mrb s natural groundwater dynamics and its climatic and physiographic controls then we conduct three additional simulations with varying irrigation water use scenarios to investigate the role of irrigation and groundwater pumping in perturbing groundwater dynamics the ctrl simulation is first spun up for 100 years by using wfdei forcing data repeatedly for the year 1979 rodell et al 2005 the ctrl simulation is performed without activating irrigation and pumping the ctrl sw is based on ctrl but activating irrigation where full irrigation demand is met from surface water sources sim gwsw is based on ctrl with irrigation and groundwater pumping activated for conjunctive use from surface and groundwater sim gw simulation represents a situation where the irrigation demand is met solely from groundwater since widespread irrigation in the mrb began in the 1990 s we conduct sim gwsw and sim gw simulations for a shorter period beginning in 2000 head based lower boundary condition and lateral flow are active in all simulations the experiments are designed to capture the natural groundwater dynamics of the mrb and the potential consequences of anthropogenic impacts such as irrigation and groundwater pumping 3 results 3 1 surface and subsurface water variations comparison of the simulated monthly streamflow with observations at six gauging stations across the lmrb indicates that the model performs well in capturing the temporal dynamics of streamflow and its seasonality correlation coefficient ranges between 0 8 and 0 99 and nse ranges between 0 7 and 0 95 across various stations given minimal precipitation during the dry season in the mrb hung et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a sun et al 2021 groundwater discharge is arguably the primary contributor to streamflow particularly during this period thus and given that no extensive basin wide data exist for a direct groundwater validation we focus on the evaluation of low flow indicators that serve as a proxy of groundwater discharge i e baseflow simulations yeh and eltahir 2005 along with a limited validation of simulated water table anomaly with observations in general flows having 85 90 and 95 percent exceedance probability i e q85 q90 and q95 respectively are simulated reasonably well across all stations fig 2 a f the mean percent deviation mpd of simulated and observed q95 q90 and q85 ranges between 4 and 8 1 5 10 and 1 5 11 respectively these comparisons of annual and low flows as well as the temporal patterns suggest that the model reasonably simulates low flow hence the underlying groundwater discharge or baseflow generation the temporal pattern of the simulated groundwater table anomaly represents a comparatively stable trend unlike the observed water table changes in the mrb that depict a continuous decline from 2007 to 2016 this can be attributed to various factors including limitations in process representation both natural and anthropogenic specifically it is likely that the model does not capture the full range of groundwater dynamics driven by local scale processes that are reflected in the point measurements of groundwater table nevertheless the model captures the declining trend of water table depletion including some of the major water table decline in 2010 and 2014 despite certain discrepancies in the magnitude fig 2i k the model also captures some of the observed water table recoveries fig 2k the findings indicate that the model can reasonably capture the observed groundwater anomaly and inter annual dynamics of groundwater changes we note that a direct comparison between the water table derived from a 5 km model grid and very limited point scale observations is not fully compatible thus these evaluations should be interpreted with sufficient caution further there could be added uncertainties due to climate forcing particularly precipitation kabir et al 2022 subsurface parameterization notably baseflow and insufficient representation of the groundwater irrigation areas that can lead to underestimation of water table decline most importantly the validation locations are predominantly located in the mekong delta where groundwater can be influenced by sea water intrusion and tides factors currently not accounted for in the model however due to high data paucity e g lack of basin wide continuous monitoring of groundwater levels this is the only viable evaluation of our simulations in addition to the validation of discharge and tws figs 2 and 3 given complex topographic features across the mrb use of a global scale lsm and limited data to constrain process simulations we consider these results to be satisfactory to study groundwater processes over the mrb similar to streamflow clm5 well simulates the temporal variations of basin averaged tws anomaly fig 3 it is evident from fig 3 that the temporal variability is accurately reproduced along with the historical dry wet transitions compared to grace observations i e shaded areas in fig 3a the good agreement with grace is evident not only visually but also statistically as indicated by a high r2 0 96 and low root mean square error rmse 21 2 mm however the model did miss some of the events such as in 2002 and 2011 two notable flood years in the mrb chinh et al 2016 dushmanta et al 2007 and the simulated peak is slightly underestimated some of these underestimations and discrepancies are likely caused by limitations inherent in the model such as absence of explicit representations of floodplain storage particularly in the lmrb pokhrel et al 2018 this limitation could have a noticeable impact on certain years particularly those characterized by flood events we find that subsurface storage plays a critical role in modulating the total tws variations and hence the hydrology of the mrb fig 3a b notably subsurface storage accounts for 81 of tws amplitude while groundwater anomaly explains 65 of the tws anomaly in the mrb subtracting soil moisture anomaly from the tws anomaly about 15 of the seasonal tws amplitude is explained by surface water storage fig 3b pie chart in line with the findings of previous studies pokhrel et al 2018b that reported this contribution to be 13 based on a global lsm higw mat that is similar to clm5 in process representation because grace provides the vertically integrated total tws not individual components groundwater and surface water contribution could not be individually validated and there are no other similar modeling studies for the entire mrb to cross compare these individual tws components the comparison of seasonal tws anomaly with grace data reveals that the overall seasonal variation is simulated reasonably well fig 3c j furthermore the broad spatial pattern of the basin wide seasonal tws anomaly is consistent with the grace data however some discrepancies are evident in the lmrb likely due to uncertainty in precipitation kabir et al 2022 in addition to model parameterizations the ability to perform a more in depth comparison with grace data is limited because of the inconsistency in spatial resolution between model and grace data we further compare simulated soil moisture with smap observations figure s4 broad arid and humid contrasts of the soil moisture across the basin are reasonably reproduced in the simulation there are however some disagreements in the wet season september november likely due to precipitation uncertainty kabir et al 2022 or uncertainties in smap data e g vegetation cover affects smap signal colliander et al 2020 ma et al 2017 these evaluations of tws and soil moisture indicate that clm5 simulates the subsurface hydrodynamics of the mrb reasonably well and could be used to examine the mechanistic interactions of the groundwater processes additionally dominance of subsurface storage variation on tws anomaly indicates a strong control of groundwater in mrb s water cycle and hence highlight the importance of improving groundwater processes understanding 3 2 groundwater flow patterns and drivers simulated annual average groundwater recharge in the mrb has distinct spatial variability ranging from less than 100 mm yr to over 1 000 mm yr with recharge rates generally decreasing from the umrb to the lmrb fig 4 a high recharge rates are simulated in regions deep blue color in fig 4a where precipitation rates are generally high laos and vietnam are two such regions with high groundwater recharge and discharge rates some regions in the lmrb s floodplains are evident with net negative groundwater recharge capillary rise likely under shallow groundwater conditions i e groundwater responds to soil moisture stress and contributes to evapotranspiration et as expected groundwater discharge follows similar spatial patterns of recharge fig 4b however some areas with high recharge and low discharge rates are simulated zoomed boxes in fig 4a and 4b suggesting that small scale variations in soil characteristics and topographical factors govern regional groundwater flow and redistribute recharge spatially to provide further insights on relatively smaller scale processes and responses we examine the basin wide recharge to precipitation rs p ratio fig 5 a and surface and subsurface fluxes in different regions across the mrb fig 5b m that represent diverse topography climate soil and vegetation characteristics high precipitation during the wet season june september is observed in locations b c and e similarly high recharge and groundwater discharge are evident in these regions with similar magnitude and climatological patterns these regions in the umrb are dominated by dense natural vegetation figure s5 and sandy soil deposits 60 sand content figure s6 that favor precipitation infiltrating and generating high groundwater recharge fig 5b d thus high rs p i e rs p between 40 and 50 is observed fig 5b d in addition to soil and vegetation characteristics the high climatic and topographic gradient affects groundwater flow that drives discharge to the surrounding valley regions however there is no linear correlation between groundwater recharge and discharge with the topographic slope other possible factors such as low water table gradient and relatively homogeneous soil texture dominated mainly by sandy soil deposits figure s6 affect direct recharge and discharge impeding regional groundwater flow in contrast relatively downstream towards the lmrb fig 5f g rs p is rather high however relatively low discharge indicates possible control of local to regional scale groundwater flow topographic slope soil characteristics and water table gradient are likely to affect the divergence of groundwater discharge fig 5f g furthermore more heterogeneous soil composition is observed in these regions figure s6 which acts as the critical factor in controlling groundwater flow for example in the intermediate soil layers figure s6 layers 6 10 there is more heterogeneity in soil texture to impact groundwater flow paths relative control of regional flow owing to differences in topographic slope as well as heterogeneous soil characteristics is evident in the mountainous regions in the mrb fig 5e g farther downstream in the lmrb floodplains fig 5h j rs p is relatively low in the order of 10 likely because the soil composition alluvial clay is 60 of the soil composition inhibits quick percolation and recharge precipitation intensity is moderate in the lmrb floodplains also in the wet season relatively high soil moisture in the lmrb figure s4 can create soil saturation near the surface that virtually makes the soil impermeable and cause less recharge than in other regions fig 5b g in addition there is consistently high et that leads to low groundwater recharge in comparison to the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil fig 6 therefore despite the high or moderate precipitation rate a relatively low recharge rate is evident thus soil characteristics has a critical control over the groundwater flow in the lmrb floodplains besides the low gradient in the water table influenced by flat topography in the lmrb floodplains controls the groundwater flow in this region rs p varies in the mekong delta ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 like the floodplain in the lmrb high clay content in the soil inhibits groundwater recharge in the mekong delta one primary reason for low recharge could be the presence of shallow clay layers figure s6 which act as a confining layer limiting recharge similar findings in the mekong delta have also been reported by tu et al 2022 overall climatic and physiographic conditions along with soil characteristics play a crucial role in governing recharge and discharge we note that we do not simulate the effects of dams and reservoirs that could influence groundwater recharge in the areas with substantial water impoundment the ratio of basin wide discharge to recharge qg rs provides further insight into the groundwater flow pathways and the impacts of the basin wide water budget a vast majority of the basin area indicated as different shades of blue color in fig 4c is a groundwater receiver suggesting that groundwater a dominant component of the basin wide water budget in the lmrb overall groundwater recharge and discharge zones follow the mrb s north to south and east to west topographic and climatic gradients 3 3 climatic control of groundwater flow high recharge and discharge zones are generally located in areas with high annual precipitation and are strongly influenced by precipitation climatology basin averaged recharge rate peaks above 100 mm in august the middle of the wet season in the mrb fig 4d and fig 6 in contrast recharge drops below 40 mm during the onset of the dry season in november about 73 of annual recharge occurs between july and september during which 40 of annual precipitation occurs fig 4d and figure s7 precipitation and recharge in the basin are highly correlated r2 0 71 suggesting a strong climate control on groundwater variations across the basin the average recharge to rainfall ratio is 34 annually and substantially higher during the wet season 52 than during the dry season 6 indicating that rainfall seasonality plays a crucial role in governing annual groundwater recharge therefore wet season rainfall substantially contributes to groundwater replenishment and can potentially buffer subsurface storage during drought this is well studied and known in the amazon river basin miguez macho and fan 2012a 2012b pokhrel et al 2013 but remains largely unexamined in the mrb 3 4 role of groundwater in surface water dynamics and governing drivers groundwater discharge over the mrb is simulated to be 401 mm yr accounting for over 50 of annual river discharge fig 5 groundwater recharge and discharge peaks occur during the wet season with a 1 2 month delayed and dampened response to precipitation fig 5b h and fig 6 a shorter time lag between precipitation and infiltration is observed in the umrb which is characterized by sandy soil deposits that enhance rapid infiltration particularly during heavy rain events generally we observe longer response time and high spatial variability toward the lmrb alluvial floodplains fig 6 groundwater recharge and discharge have a 2 3 month delayed response to infiltration and precipitation in the lmrb allowing groundwater recharge to carry over to the subsequent season and acts as a critical source of baseflow to rivers to maintain dry season flow also comparable magnitude of basin scale groundwater discharge and total runoff over the entire dry period november may further underscores that groundwater supports the bulk of the total streamflow and its seasonal variation essentially governs surface water fluxes fig 6 further a substantially higher negative rs p during the dry season fig 5f and 5i suggests that groundwater storage significantly contributes to augmenting soil moisture and et particularly in the lmrb some regions are evident where a negative rs p ratio is observed for consecutive 3 4 months after the offset of the wet season in september fig 5e g suggesting that groundwater responds to soil moisture deficit for a considerable period when precipitation is low basin wide negative recharge during december to may further indicates that groundwater acts as a basin wide soil moisture buffer to support dry season soil moisture and et fig 6 implying that groundwater dynamics has a far reaching influence on the water and energy cycle in the mrb overall the interaction between groundwater and surface water in the mrb is regulated by a complex set of drivers including seasonal variations in precipitation soil properties and topography the impacts of human activities such as irrigation and groundwater pumping are discussed in the later section notably the results are simulation based and depend on a variety of model parameterizations such as soil layer configurations subsurface parameterizations and input datasets used all of which are subject to certain degree of uncertainty which all can affect simulation outcomes however our results provide detailed insights on the different groundwater processes from surface infiltration to the subsurface groundwater discharge leading to a mechanistic understanding on the dynamic interactions among the tightly coupled surface water groundwater processes across the mrb 3 5 groundwater flow impacted by aquifer pumping finally we examine how increased groundwater pumping for irrigation impacts groundwater systems in the mrb we specifically quantify the changes in groundwater flow and water table depth caused by increased aquifer pumping for dry season irrigation we focus on the mekong delta region that accounts for the majority of irrigated crops and where widespread irrigation is increasing in recent years in other parts of the mrb agricultural systems are mostly rainfed figure s8 the simulated annual irrigation demand in the mrb varies from 25 to over 250 mm fig 7 a in some portions of the mekong delta irrigation demand is relatively high for example up to 200 mm yr fig 7a and these results are consistent with previous estimates reported in global scale studies for year 2010 wada et al 2016 irrigation validation could be further enhanced by using satellite based datasets i e brocca et al 2018 koch et al 2020 however our results should be interpreted with caution because of possible uncertainties arising from the uncertainty in climate forcing and irrigation datasets used further there could be under representation of the recent irrigation development that is likely to cause an underestimated groundwater withdrawal a more in depth evaluation is not possible because of the lack of spatially explicit datasets on irrigation withdrawals in the mrb irrigation pumping imposes a water table gradient causing up to half a meter of water table decline in the mekong delta fig 8 a in general when averaged over a long period the simulated effect of groundwater pumping is not substantial even in the mekong delta especially in comparison to that in other major agricultural regions worldwide this is so even when irrigation demand is met from the groundwater resource i e sim gw simulation since irrigation development in the mrb is relatively recent i e it started a few decades ago long term climate variability balances the pumping effects however widespread storage depletion is simulated in the mekong delta during the selected dry years i e 2005 and 2015 the depletion is more than double in pumping cells in 2005 and 2015 compared to the long term average water level decline and substantially large area of depletion is readily discernible fig 8b c depletion reaches 1 m at the center of the mekong delta and 0 5 m at the borders during 2005 under the increased influence of groundwater pumping sim gw simulation these results are consistent with previous estimates reported by regional scale studies on the mekong delta although the simulated absolute depletion may be underestimated because the information on the recent increase in groundwater pumping for irrigation minderhoud et al 2020 2017 is not accounted for in our model water table gradient induces a shift in groundwater flow in the mekong delta fig 8b c notably during dry years the decline in water table fig 8b drives large flow towards the pumping cells from the surrounding resulting in an increase in groundwater discharge in the neighboring cells in sim gw simulation positive difference compared to the ctrl simulation fig 8e f such pumping induced alterations of groundwater dynamics particularly during dry years imply that groundwater depletion in the mekong delta could be exacerbated if prolonged droughts were to occur in the future the change in lateral groundwater flow based on signs further signifies the growing influence of irrigation and pumping on the region s groundwater systems fig 7c d for instance red cells in fig 7c lateral outflow turn blue lateral inflow due to the pumping induced head gradient that triggers a substantial lateral flow towards the cone of depression red blob fig 8b in general groundwater withdrawals are likely to be unsustainable in the mekong delta if irrigation and pumping continue to expand in the future notably the model shows promising potential to simulate irrigation and its influence on groundwater and in identifying depletion hotspots however it is important to note that local scale phenomena such as cone of depression resulting from pumping induced water table gradient may not have been captured adequately at the current spatial resolution i e 5 km 4 conclusion this study examines groundwater mechanisms governing processes and the interactions between groundwater and surface water under natural conditions and anthropogenic influences over the mrb using a fully distributed and process based lsm with improved groundwater representation that accounts for lateral groundwater flow and aquifer pumping results are first validated with observed streamflow water table grace based tws and smap based soil moisture data then used to examine groundwater flow processes across the mrb the governing mechanism and the effects of increasing irrigation activities on groundwater systems in the lmrb the following summarizes the key findings of the study first groundwater flow in the mrb exhibits high spatially heterogeneities driven by a combination of factors including regional topography climate and local or regional scale subsurface characteristics the climate precipitation intensity and seasonality has a first order control on recharge and discharge variations across the basin further regional subsurface characteristics dominantly control the recharge dynamics especially in the lmrb second in the lmrb groundwater is the dominant source of streamflow and its spatial variation and seasonality strongly modulate surface water dynamics in some regions groundwater perennially feeds streamflow this mechanism is highlighted using an in depth analysis over selected regions across the mrb with varying climatic hydrologic and geologic characteristics third groundwater storage acts as a hydrological buffer and contributes substantially to soil moisture and et for a considerable period of the year these findings suggest a strong control of groundwater dynamics on the mrb s surface water and energy balances with potential implications of perturbing the natural groundwater dynamics on surface water and energy fluxes fourth groundwater use for irrigation has not had notable impact on groundwater dynamics over the long term but the model simulates a region wide storage depletion in the mekong delta during dry years resulting in a shift in groundwater dynamics also altering the magnitude and direction of groundwater discharge and lateral flow we note that our results are based on model simulations and may include uncertainties arising for example from forcing data model resolution and imperfect groundwater parameterizations thus the results should be interpreted with caution particularly for local scale implications of groundwater depletion hotspots and cone of depression further the irrigation and groundwater data we used are from global databases which may not include the most recent developments in groundwater irrigation potentially underestimating the irrigation induced changes in groundwater in the mekong delta our study offers a detailed discussion on the natural groundwater dynamics in the mrb as well as the potential impacts of irrigation development and groundwater withdrawal a more comprehensive understanding of the groundwater dynamics in the mrb could require consideration of dams and reservoir operation in the simulation which forms a potential avenue for future research future studies could address these limitations by further refining model parameterizations particularly for subsurface runoff improving process representation and using any new datasets despite certain limitations this study provides the first results on groundwater modeling for the entire mrb and by using a process based lsm that includes a prognostic groundwater scheme and aquifer pumping for irrigation our study also advances groundwater modeling
