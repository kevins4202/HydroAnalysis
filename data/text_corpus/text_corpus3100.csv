15500,dissolved air flotation daf is an efficient process to remove impurities from fresh or salt water as the removal is based on the agglomeration of impurities on the generated microbubbles the size distribution and concentration of air bubbles are key parameters in dissolved air flotation however the development of microbubbles in the whole flotation process remains unexplored in this study we show that state of the art inline microscopy enables the image acquisition of bubbles in daf based on image analysis thousands of microbubbles 10 200 µm were analyzed within 6 12 min experiments consequently bubble size distributions and bubble concentrations can be determined with moderate effort bubble size distributions were measured in a lab scale daf comprising a saturation unit a decompression valve in after which the bubbles are formed and the actual flotation tank the state of the microbubbles is not only determined at different positions within the tank but also in the supply pipe from the decompression valve to the tank all bubble size distributions were unimodal and can be described well with burr xii distributions for fresh water bubble size increased while bubble concentration decreased along the supply pipe between the decompression valve and the inlet of the flotation tank indicating bubble coalescence compared to freshwater saltwater inhibited this bubble coalescence in the pipe within the flotation tank the bubble size did not change drastically for neither salt nor freshwater however the bubble concentration decreased for both waters which could be explained by dilution effects our results demonstrate that the developed inline method is a promising tool to study the evolution of microbubbles in flotation systems further it might also be applied to investigate microbubbles in other processes such as fermentation decomposition of organic compounds and fouling mitigation in membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

molecular weight gas the application of microbubbles can be seen in various industries like mining waste water treatment chemical medicine civil sanitary and fish and shellfish culture edzwald 2010

ultrasound imaging bubble columns separation of minerals and separation of impurities in the water and wastewater treatment edzwald 2010 levitsky et al 2022 due to hydrophobic behavior microbubbles are used in dissolved air flotation daf to efficiently remove pollutants proteins microorganisms ions fines and ultrafine particles turbidity precipitates and emulsified oils in water edzwald 2010 pereira et al 2020 rodrigues and rubio 2007 daf is also playing an increasingly important role in desalination plants to pre treat seawater before reverse osmosis this pre treatment prevents clogging of membranes valavala et al 2011 fanaie khiadani 2020 to form bubbles in daf water is saturated with air under pressure first then the saturated water is expanded to atmospheric pressure which results in bubble formation the bubbles are introduced into the flotation tank to interact with the impurities in the water finally the bubbles attach to the impurities and rise to the surface of water as a foam consisting of bubble impurity complexes the removal efficiency of daf relies on various factors like the conditions under which the bubbles and flocs interact and the generation of enough bubbles edzwald 2010 wang et al 2021b along with these factors there are various influential parameters like flow rate rising velocity salt concentration waste characteristics surface tension and air to solid ratio that significantly affect the efficiency of daf it has been noticed that the size of bubbles is one of the crucial parameters which directly influences the rising velocity and the interaction of bubbles and flocs edzwald 2010 lakghomi et al 2015 schmideder et al 2018 wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to investigate the bubble size distribution bsd during the flotation process however analyzing microbubbles comes with some challenges firstly the instability of bubbles due to coalescence and breakage results in size heterogeneities and location dependent bubble size distributions further many applications of microbubbles ask for high bubble densities thus methods to analyze microbubbles should enable the measurement of bubble size distributions the flexible measurement at different locations inline applications online offline applications could lead to altered bsd the measurement of systems with high bubble densities table 1 gives an overview of the methods available to measure bsds the measurement of bsds can be performed using image analysis specifically online and inline imaging the online imaging of microbubbles in sample tubes has been practiced since the nineties and has been improved over the decades gulden et al 2018 rijk et al 1994 rodrigues and rubio 2003 while this method is flexible in terms of different locations sampling probably alters the bsd inline applications majumder et al 2006 fanaie and khiadani 2020 swart et al 2020 swart et al 2022 overcame this limitation i e they do not alter the bsd however imaging through the whole bubble column majumder et al 2006 flotation tank fanaie and khiadani 2020 or a viewing slit swart et al 2020 2022 is restricted to thin column tank slit diameters and or low bubble densities based on the application of an inline microscope with an optical resolution of 17 µm ali and solsvik 2021 investigated the bsd in a stirred tank reactor observing sauter mean diameters between 1000 and 6000 µm besides image analysis obscuration intensity based particle counting han et al 2002 and laser diffraction couto et al 2009 can also be used to investigate the bsd however both methods require the use of sampling tubes further the differentiation between bubbles and particles droplets in applications such as flotation would be nearly impossible chen et al 2017 presented an ultrasound based method however the authors mention that this kind of method has to be further improved in terms of robustness and applicability to gas liquid solid three phase systems available techniques are incapable to provide an accurate and flexible measurement of bsds without altering it thus we propose an inline method which is flexible in terms of bsd measurements at various locations and does not alter the bsd itself further the analysis of thousands of bubbles takes only 6 12 min the newly proposed technique might also be used in other applications with microbubbles such as bubble columns and applied to gas liquid solid three phase systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 dissolved air flotation setup we used a similar laboratory flotation device lab float 20 aquatector microfloat enviplan ingenieurgesellschaft mbh lichtenau henglarn germany as in the experimental work in gulden et al 2018 and the modeling study in schmideder et al 2018 the experimental setup and the respective flowsheet are shown in figs s1 and 1 respectively in all experiments the volume flow of the fluid was 100 l h centrifugal pump pbc 50 elwa germany and the used piping systems had an inner diameter of 13 mm to reduce the provided laboratory compressed air 9 bar a pressure reducer gauge was installed in front of the saturator aquatector enviplan germany the fluid was saturated with air at 4 b a r in the saturator and the working pressure before the decompression valve ifloat enviplan germany was 2 b a r through the valve the saturated fluid was decompressed to ambient pressure this led to a supersaturation of the fluid and the formation of microbubbles gulden et al 2018 we started the measurements when the bubble cloud was visible and stable in the whole flotation tank in the experiments deionized and salt water were used as fluid at ambient temperature with a concentration of 35 g l nacl carl roth karlsruhe germany article number 9265 the salt water mimicked a realistic concentration of sea water haarhoff and edzwald 2013 2 2 image acquisition of microbubbles images were acquired with an inline microscope particleview v19 mettler toledo inc usa at a frame rate of 2 s 1 back lighting was applied based on a clamp on reflector mettler toledo inc usa fig s2 resulting in trans illuminated images the focal plane was 150 µm from the lens to enable the analysis of the microbubbles in the tank fig 1a and the pipe between the decompression valve and the tank fig 1b two experimental setups were used both setups are described in the following 2 2 1 measurements in the flotation tank to investigate the bubbles inside the flotation tank the setup shown in figs 1a and s1 with a total volume of 10 l was used the length of the pipe between the decompression valve and the inlet of the tank was 400 mm at the inlet of the cylindrical tank inner diameter 240 mm height 245 mm a cylinder inner diameter 52 mm outer diameter 60 mm height 60 mm is installed to control the flow figs 1 and s1 the microscope probe could flexibly be installed at different locations in the tank fig s1 thereby the probe was set up at a 30 angle to the tank wall in regions with a low flow velocity bubbles attached on the lens which lowered the image quality significantly thus for all measurements in the tank we used a device to remove the bubbles based on a fluid flow for this purpose the flexible pipe of a syringe pump typ 11 elite harvard apparatus usa was connected to the microscope probe via a holder fig s1 in the holder there was a needle sized hole through this hole 7 ml min deionized water was pumped towards the lens to remove attached bubbles 2 2 2 measurements before the flotation tank to investigate the development of the bubbles before the flotation tank the microscope probe was installed perpendicular in the pipe between the decompression valve and the flotation tank via a t piece figs 1b and s3 to minimize the influence on fluid dynamics the lens and the used clamp on reflector were installed close to the wall of the pipe fig s4 the distance between the decompression valve and the microscope probe was varied between 70 and 2000 mm to enable the measurements in this broad range a second tank inner diameter 190 mm height 350 mm with a cylinder inner diameter 50 mm outer diameter 60 mm height 55 mm was integrated in the fluid cycle figs 1 and s3 this tank was connected to the tank described in section 2 2 1 which was now used as fluid reservoir the total fluid volume in this setup was 15 l 2 3 image and data analysis we set up an automated image and data analysis pipeline to investigate the 157 202 acquired images from 136 experiments the developed algorithm is explained in the following and can be downloaded along with the acquired and analyzed images via the provided link https doi org 10 14459 2022mp1653047 reviewer login schmideder forschungsdaten review password 95kvb 83mnf kjnwera to detect the bubbles all images were processed according to the image analysis pipeline shown in fig 2 in a first step the frangi vesselness filter matlab function fibermetric frangi et al 1998 was applied on the raw image fig 2a as a result the contrast of the edge of bubbles which look like fibers was enhanced fig 2b this step facilitated the binarization fig 2c where otsu s method otsu 1979 was used to calculate the grey value threshold then objects with an area smaller than 49 μ m 2 were deleted and the holes of the remaining objects were filled fig 2d the shape of microbubbles hardly deforms and can be assumed as spherical edzwald 2010 thus as a last step shape parameters where applied to reject non spherical objects fig 2e more precisely only objects with a circularity 0 4 c i r c u l a r i t y 4 π a r e a p e r i m e t e r 2 and an eccentricity 0 4 ratio of the distance between the foci of the object s ellipse and its major axis length were detected as bubbles in fig 2f the red circles mark the detected bubbles in the raw image then the area equivalent spherical diameter of each detected bubble was calculated d a 4 a r e a π after analyzing the images the results were summarized in a table including the following information for each experiment number of total images number of detected bubbles minimum maximum mean median and standard deviation of area equivalent spherical diameter of bubbles further the output of each experiment contains the equivalent diameters of all detected bubbles which can be used for subsequent analysis the bubble concentration was calculated by dividing the number of detected bubbles by the number of images per experiment note that the reported concentration is not the absolute volume based bubble concentration however as the focal settings have been set identical in all experiments a reasonable relative estimate of the concentration should be obtained by this image based bubble concentration 2 4 mathematical description of bubble size distributions to describe the bubbles size distributions mathematically we used the burr xii distribution rodriguez 1977 as probability density function pdf 1 f x α c k k c α x α c 1 1 x α c k 1 where k shape parameter c shape parameter and α scale parameter are all greater than 0 3 results and discussion our methodology allowed the inline image acquisition and analysis of thousands of microbubbles per experiment while each experiment lasted 6 12 min the measurements were conducted in the flotation tank as well as in the pipe between the decompression valve and the tank in the following the development of the bubbles in the pipe section 3 1 and the tank section 3 2 are described for both deionized and salt water further all investigated bubble size distributions are mathematically characterized in section 3 3 3 1 development of the bubbles in the pipe most dissolved air flotation setups contain a pipe between the flotation tank and the decompression valve where the bubbles are generated to investigate the development of microbubbles along the pipe we conducted inline image analysis at different locations in the pipe fig 3 we found that the size of the bubbles increased significantly with increasing distance from the decompression valve figs 3 and 4 exemplary images of experiments with deionized water at positions 15 cm 40 cm and 120 cm from the decompression valve illustrate this observation fig 3 fig 4a shows a significant increase of the bubble size along the pipe in both systems deionized and salt water however the increase of the bubble size was lower when applying salt water while the mean equivalent diameter 7 cm behind the decompression valve for deionized water and salt water was 20 and 24 µm 200 cm behind the valve it increased to 51 and 43 µm respectively in between these measurement locations the bubble size increased perpetual however the decrease in slope indicates that a stationary condition could be attained at considerable long distances from the decompression valve visual inspection of all bubble size distributions in the pipe figs s16 s29 showed a unimodal behavior the mathematical representation of all distributions is given in section 3 3 while the size of the bubbles increased along the pipe the detected bubble number per image decreased fig 4b this observation confirms the visual impressions of the exemplary images of fig 3 in the first 60 cm after the decompression valve about 30 45 bubbles were detected per image for deionized and salt water this value decreased to 13 and 17 200 cm behind the decompression valve respectively in general deionized water resulted in a stronger decrease of the bubble number it is well known that microbubbles change when they are transported in pipes gulden et al 2018 rijk et al 1994 although this change might strongly influence bubble characteristics and thus the flotation efficiency to our knowledge there is no study that investigated the development of microbubbles in the pipe before the tank of daf our results show that the bubble size and bubble number change significantly when the microbubbles are transported in the pipe between the decompression valve and the tank a reason for the observed increase of the bubble size and decrease of the bubble number might be coalescence which results from drainage of liquid films between bubbles nguyen 2017 according to nguyen 2017 salts can influence bubble coalescence by modifying the surface tension and mobility of the bubble liquid interface in their extensive study the stability of liquid films between bubbles increased with increasing salt concentrations and thus salt reduced bubble coalescence in our study inhibited bubble coalescence in salt water might explain the smaller increase in bubble size and smaller decrease in bubble number when compared to deionized water 3 2 development of the bubbles in the tank it is known that the size and concentration of bubbles can vary when comparing different positions in the flotation tank fanaie and khiadani 2020 leppinen and dalziel 2004 to investigate the local bubble size and bubble number inside the tank the microscope probe was installed at different locations and the resulting images were analyzed fig 5 as measurements in the flotation tank were taken using a 40 cm pipe between the decompression valve and the inlet of the tank position 1 in the tank 4 5 cm above the entrance of the tank should result in similar bsds as measurements in the pipe 40 cm behind the decompression valve the former statement has been verified by the results shown in fig s5 in comparison to the results in the pipe the size of the bubbles did not change drastically fig 5b in salt water the mean equivalent bubble diameter at the five measuring points ranged between 32 and 37 µm with 40 43 µm the mean diameter in deionized water at measuring points 1 2 3 and 5 was slightly higher at measuring point 4 the mean diameter was 50 µm while visual inspection of all bubble size distributions in the tank showed a unimodal behavior figs s6 s15 their mathematical representation is given in section 3 3 close to the inlet of the tank the detected bubble number per image was about 28 and 22 in deionized and salt water respectively fig 5c in the course of the measuring points 2 5 the bubble number of both systems decreased at measuring point 5 deionized and salt water had a similar bubble number of about 4 5 for deionized and salt water the mean diameter of bubbles ranged between 40 50 µm and 32 37 µm respectively this trend is in accordance with literature in gulden et al 2018 salt water 117 g l nacl reduced the sauter mean diameter of bubbles approximately 65 µm in the daf tank when compared to deionized water approximately 85 µm similarly in the daf tank of fanaie and khiadani 2020 the size of bubbles in freshwater was between 40 and 250 µm while in salt water 30 g l nacl bubbles were smaller and varied between 20 and 160 µm similar to gulden et al 2018 and fanaie and khiadani 2020 we suggest that the salt might have inhibited bubble coalescence this is in accordance with coalescence theory of bubbles nguyen 2017 in leppinen and dalziel 2004 the mean bubble size in an industrial scale flotation plant ranged from 80 µm to 165 µm at different locations however with a volume of about 100 m 3 the size of the flotation tank was much larger than the used laboratory flotation device used in this study 12 l in industrial plants bubbles have more time to coalesce before they reach the surface that is probably why the bubble size changed more in leppinen and dalziel 2004 than in our flotation tank however it has to be mentioned that they used a sample pipe to investigate the bubble size based on offline analysis which could alter the bubbles gulden et al 2018 in our study the bubble number concentration decreased in the course of the measuring points fig 5 while the bubble size stays nearly constant thus we hypothesize that the decrease of the bubble concentration results mainly from dilution effects the dilution of bubbles in flotation devices has already been observed in cfd simulations schmideder et al 2018 3 3 mathematical representation of bubble size distributions the focus of this section is on size distributions that accurately describe the bubbles in the pipe and the flotation tank for both deionized and salt water our analysis revealed that all bubble size distributions bsds fit well with the burr xii distribution section 2 4 showing coefficients of correlation r 2 higher than 0 95 for all distributions except one case salt water in pipe at 200 cm where r 2 0 88 fig 6 shows normalized histograms of the bsds in the pipe for both deionized and salt water for each location in the pipe distance to the decompression valve 7 15 28 40 60 120 and 200 cm one exemplary bsd is shown along with the fitted burr xii distribution all bsds with their respective burr xii distribution are shown in figs s16 s29 based on the high r 2 values and visual inspection we suggest that the bsds inside the pipe can be well described with the burr xii distribution additionally the density distribution of bubbles in salt water and deionized water was examined inside the flotation tank at five separate locations labeled 1 2 3 4 and 5 compare fig 5a for a detailed description of locations exemplary normalized histograms along with the fitted burr xii distributions are shown in fig 7 all distributions are shown in figs s6 s15 similar to the pipe the bsds in the tank could be fitted well with the burr xii distribution resulting in high r 2 values all fitted parameters of the burr xii distributions and the corresponding r 2 are shown in each figure to the authors knowledge there are no mathematical descriptions of the size distribution of bubbles in daf in the literature thus various distributions from two as well as three parameter distribution families such as birnbaum saunders distribution gamma distribution log normal distribution and t location scale distribution were screened of all these distributions the burr xii distribution was the only one that adequately r 2 0 95 fitted in all cases except one case salt water in pipe at 200 cm r 2 0 88 3 4 critical evaluation of the used inline microscopy and comparison with existing methods to analyze microbubbles in daf our study is the first application of inline microscopy to analyze microbubbles in daf which is a process with a very high density of small bubbles further the size distribution and the concentration of bubbles can change rapidly in daf these circumstances pose specific challenges when analyzing the development of microbubbles in the following our developed method is critically discussed and compared to existing methods similar to online methods in daf tanks that are based on sampling through pipes imaging gulden et al 2018 rijk et al 1994 rodrigues and rubio 2003 intensity based particle counting han et al 2002 laser diffraction couto et al 2009 chen et al 2017 our proposed methodology enables the flexible analysis of microbubbles at all locations in flotation tanks however our measurement system does not require sampling in tubes which can alter the size distribution and concentration of bubbles gulden et al 2018 the applied inline microscopy is based on an optical system on top of a rod where the focus is close to the lens thus our method is not restricted to thin geometries and results in high quality images even in the applied daf system with a high bubble density contrary inline imaging through the whole flotation tank fanaie and khiadani 2020 bubble column majumder et al 2006 or a viewing slit swart et al 2020 2022 can be restricted to thin tank column slit diameters and or low bubble densities however the mentioned existing inline methods are non invasive while the use of our microscope probe might possibly affect the measurement thus we took special care to ensure that the positioning of the microscope probe disturbed the flow as little as possible more precise the probe lens and clamp on reflector fig s2 was placed at the edge of the pipe through a t piece fig s4 despite the care the setup did result in a slight reduction of the pipe which might influence the fluid dynamics in our study bubbles in the pipe between the decompression valve and the daf tank were analyzed for the first time this further underlines the flexibility of the proposed approach the study shows that bubble coalescence along the pipe might lead to a decrease of the bubble concentration and an increase of the bubble size that leads to decreased surface areas of bubbles and might reduce flotation efficiency thus we suggest to reduce the pipe length between the decompression valve and the flotation tank although the aforementioned inline and online methods have not been used to investigate bubbles in the pipe before the daf tank they might also be adapted to this issue to determine size distributions a sufficient amount of samples need to be analyzed according to vigneau et al 1999 and rice et al 2013 more than 500 samples should be analyzed while we detected at least 3 207 bubbles per experiment in most experiments more than 10 000 bubbles were analyzed 4 conclusions our major findings include the following inline imaging enables the analysis of bubble size distributions and concentrations number of bubbles per image within minutes contrary to available techniques laser scattering laser diffraction ultrasound imaging through viewing glass sampling is not required and analysis can be conducted at all locations of flotation processes coalescence and dilution of microbubbles can be investigated based on image analysis pipeline compared to freshwater salt water inhibited coalescence all bubble size distributions were unimodal and can be described well with the burr xii distribution based on the developed method and results we suggest that future studies should focus on following issues the investigation of the evolution of microbubbles before they enter the flotation tank coalescence could reduce the available bubble surface area where impurities can attach agglomeration between bubbles and particles should be quantified and located as both can be visualized with inline microscopy validation and improvement of existing modeling approaches for the flow coalescence breakage and agglomeration of microbubbles in flotation plants through our developed method the required large and detailed data sets can be generated application of our developed method to investigate microbubbles in other processes such as fermentations chemical reactions decomposition of organic compounds and fouling

installed to control the flow figs 1 and s1 the microscope probe could flexibly be installed at different locations in the tank fig s1 thereby the probe was set up at a 30 angle to the tank wall in regions with a low flow velocity bubbles attached on the lens which lowered the image quality significantly thus for all measurements in the tank we used a device to remove the bubbles based on a fluid flow for this purpose the flexible pipe of a syringe pump typ 11 elite harvard apparatus usa was connected to the microscope probe via a holder fig s1 in the holder there was a needle sized hole through this hole 7 ml min deionized water was pumped towards the lens to remove attached bubbles 2 2 2 measurements before the flotation tank to investigate the development of the bubbles before the flotation tank the microscope probe was installed perpendicular in the pipe between the decompression valve and the flotation tank via a t piece figs 1b and s3 to minimize the influence on fluid dynamics the lens and the used clamp on reflector were installed close to the wall of the pipe fig s4 the distance between the decompression valve and the microscope probe was varied between 70 and 2000 mm to enable the measurements in this broad range a second tank inner diameter 190 mm height 350 mm with a cylinder inner diameter 50 mm outer diameter 60 mm height 55 mm was integrated in the fluid cycle figs 1 and s3 this tank was connected to the tank described in section 2 2 1 which was now used as fluid reservoir the total fluid volume in this setup was 15 l 2 3 image and data analysis we set up an automated image and data analysis pipeline to investigate the 157 202 acquired images from 136 experiments the developed algorithm is explained in the following and can be downloaded along with the acquired and analyzed images via the provided link https doi org 10 14459 2022mp1653047 reviewer login schmideder forschungsdaten review password 95kvb 83mnf kjnwera to detect the bubbles all images were processed according to the image analysis pipeline shown in fig 2 in a first step the frangi vesselness filter matlab function fibermetric frangi et al 1998 was applied on the raw image fig 2a as a result the contrast of the edge of bubbles which look like fibers was enhanced fig 2b this step facilitated the binarization fig 2c where otsu s method otsu 1979 was used to calculate the grey value threshold then objects with an area smaller than 49 μ m 2 were deleted and the holes of the remaining objects were filled fig 2d the shape of microbubbles hardly deforms and can be assumed as spherical edzwald 2010 thus as a last step shape parameters where applied to reject non spherical objects fig 2e more precisely only objects with a circularity 0 4 c i r c u l a r i t y 4 π a r e a p e r i m e t e r 2 and an eccentricity 0 4 ratio of the distance between the foci of the object s ellipse and its major axis length were detected as bubbles in fig 2f the red circles mark the detected bubbles in the raw image then the area equivalent spherical diameter of each detected bubble was calculated d a 4 a r e a π after analyzing the images the results were summarized in a table including the following information for each experiment number of total images number of detected bubbles minimum maximum mean median and standard deviation of area equivalent spherical diameter of bubbles further the output of each experiment contains the equivalent diameters of all detected bubbles which can be used for subsequent analysis the bubble concentration was calculated by dividing the number of detected bubbles by the number of images per experiment note that the reported concentration is not the absolute volume based bubble concentration however as the focal settings have been set identical in all experiments a reasonable relative estimate of the concentration should be obtained by this image based bubble concentration 2 4 mathematical description of bubble size distributions to describe the bubbles size distributions mathematically we used the burr xii distribution rodriguez 1977 as probability density function pdf 1 f x α c k k c α x α c 1 1 x α c k 1 where k shape parameter c shape parameter and α scale parameter are all greater than 0 3 results and discussion our methodology allowed the inline image acquisition and analysis of thousands of microbubbles per experiment while each experiment lasted 6 12 min the measurements were conducted in the flotation tank as well as in the pipe between the decompression valve and the tank in the following the development of the bubbles in the pipe section 3 1 and the tank section 3 2 are described for both deionized and salt water further all investigated bubble size distributions are mathematically characterized in section 3 3 3 1 development of the bubbles in the pipe most dissolved air flotation setups contain a pipe between the flotation tank and the decompression valve where the bubbles are generated to investigate the development of microbubbles along the pipe we conducted inline image analysis at different locations in the pipe fig 3 we found that the size of the bubbles increased significantly with increasing distance from the decompression valve figs 3 and 4 exemplary images of experiments with deionized water at positions 15 cm 40 cm and 120 cm from the decompression valve illustrate this observation fig 3 fig 4a shows a significant increase of the bubble size along the pipe in both systems deionized and salt water however the increase of the bubble size was lower when applying salt water while the mean equivalent diameter 7 cm behind the decompression valve for deionized water and salt water was 20 and 24 µm 200 cm behind the valve it increased to 51 and 43 µm respectively in between these measurement locations the bubble size increased perpetual however the decrease in slope indicates that a stationary condition could be attained at considerable long distances from the decompression valve visual inspection of all bubble size distributions in the pipe figs s16 s29 showed a unimodal behavior the mathematical representation of all distributions is given in section 3 3 while the size of the bubbles increased along the pipe the detected bubble number per image decreased fig 4b this observation confirms the visual impressions of the exemplary images of fig 3 in the first 60 cm after the decompression valve about 30 45 bubbles were detected per image for deionized and salt water this value decreased to 13 and 17 200 cm behind the decompression valve respectively in general deionized water resulted in a stronger decrease of the bubble number it is well known that microbubbles change when they are transported in pipes gulden et al 2018 rijk et al 1994 although this change might strongly influence bubble characteristics and thus the flotation efficiency to our knowledge there is no study that investigated the development of microbubbles in the pipe before the tank of daf our results show that the bubble size and bubble number change significantly when the microbubbles are transported in the pipe between the decompression valve and the tank a reason for the observed increase of the bubble size and decrease of the bubble number might be coalescence which results from drainage of liquid films between bubbles nguyen 2017 according to nguyen 2017 salts can influence bubble coalescence by modifying the surface tension and mobility of the bubble liquid interface in their extensive study the stability of liquid films between bubbles increased with increasing salt concentrations and thus salt reduced bubble coalescence in our study inhibited bubble coalescence in salt water might explain the smaller increase in bubble size and smaller decrease in bubble number when compared to deionized water 3 2 development of the bubbles in the tank it is known that the size and concentration of bubbles can vary when comparing different positions in the flotation tank fanaie and khiadani 2020 leppinen and dalziel 2004 to investigate the local bubble size and bubble number inside the tank the microscope probe was installed at different locations and the resulting images were analyzed fig 5 as measurements in the flotation tank were taken using a 40 cm pipe between the decompression valve and the inlet of the tank position 1 in the tank 4 5 cm above the entrance of the tank should result in similar bsds as measurements in the pipe 40 cm behind the decompression valve the former statement has been verified by the results shown in fig s5 in comparison to the results in the pipe the size of the bubbles did not change drastically fig 5b in salt water the mean equivalent bubble diameter at the five measuring points ranged between 32 and 37 µm with 40 43 µm the mean diameter in deionized water at measuring points 1 2 3 and 5 was slightly higher at measuring point 4 the mean diameter was 50 µm while visual inspection of all bubble size distributions in the tank showed a unimodal behavior figs s6 s15 their mathematical representation is given in section 3 3 close to the inlet of the tank the detected bubble number per image was about 28 and 22 in deionized and salt water respectively fig 5c in the course of the measuring points 2 5 the bubble number of both systems decreased at measuring point 5 deionized and salt water had a similar bubble number of about 4 5 for deionized and salt water the mean diameter of bubbles ranged between 40 50 µm and 32 37 µm respectively this trend is in accordance with literature in gulden et al 2018 salt water 117 g l nacl reduced the sauter mean diameter of bubbles approximately 65 µm in the daf tank when compared to deionized water approximately 85 µm similarly in the daf tank of fanaie and khiadani 2020 the size of bubbles in freshwater was between 40 and 250 µm while in salt water 30 g l nacl bubbles were smaller and varied between 20 and 160 µm similar to gulden et al 2018 and fanaie and khiadani 2020 we suggest that the salt might have inhibited bubble coalescence this is in accordance with coalescence theory of bubbles nguyen 2017 in leppinen and dalziel 2004 the mean bubble size in an industrial scale flotation plant ranged from 80 µm to 165 µm at different locations however with a volume of about 100 m 3 the size of the flotation tank was much larger than the used laboratory flotation device used in this study 12 l in industrial plants bubbles have more time to coalesce before they reach the surface that is probably why the bubble size changed more in leppinen and dalziel 2004 than in our flotation tank however it has to be mentioned that they used a sample pipe to investigate the bubble size based on offline analysis which could alter the bubbles gulden et al 2018 in our study the bubble number concentration decreased in the course of the measuring points fig 5 while the bubble size stays nearly constant thus we hypothesize that the decrease of the bubble concentration results mainly from dilution effects the dilution of bubbles in flotation devices has already been observed in cfd simulations schmideder et al 2018 3 3 mathematical representation of bubble size distributions the focus of this section is on size distributions that accurately describe the bubbles in the pipe and the flotation tank for both deionized and salt water our analysis revealed that all bubble size distributions bsds fit well with the burr xii distribution section 2 4 showing coefficients of correlation r 2 higher than 0 95 for all distributions except one case salt water in pipe at 200 cm where r 2 0 88 fig 6 shows normalized histograms of the bsds in the pipe for both deionized and salt water for each location in the pipe distance to the decompression valve 7 15 28 40 60 120 and 200 cm one exemplary bsd is shown along with the fitted burr xii distribution all bsds with their respective burr xii distribution are shown in figs s16 s29 based on the high r 2 values and visual inspection we suggest that the bsds inside the pipe can be well described with the burr xii distribution additionally the density distribution of bubbles in salt water and deionized water was examined inside the flotation tank at five separate locations labeled 1 2 3 4 and 5 compare fig 5a for a detailed description of locations exemplary normalized histograms along with the fitted burr xii distributions are shown in fig 7 all distributions are shown in figs s6 s15 similar to the pipe the bsds in the tank could be fitted well with the burr xii distribution resulting in high r 2 values all fitted parameters of the burr xii distributions and the corresponding r 2 are shown in each figure to the authors knowledge there are no mathematical descriptions of the size distribution of bubbles in daf in the literature thus various distributions from two as well as three parameter distribution families such as birnbaum saunders distribution gamma distribution log normal distribution and t location scale distribution were screened of all these distributions the burr xii distribution was the only one that adequately r 2 0 95 fitted in all cases except one case salt water in pipe at 200 cm r 2 0 88 3 4 critical evaluation of the used inline microscopy and comparison with existing methods to analyze microbubbles in daf our study is the first application of inline microscopy to analyze microbubbles in daf which is a process with a very high density of small bubbles further the size distribution and the concentration of bubbles can change rapidly in daf these circumstances pose specific challenges when analyzing the development of microbubbles in the following our developed method is critically discussed and compared to existing methods similar to online methods in daf tanks that are based on sampling through pipes imaging gulden et al 2018 rijk et al 1994 rodrigues and rubio 2003 intensity based particle counting han et al 2002 laser diffraction couto et al 2009 chen et al 2017 our proposed methodology enables the flexible analysis of microbubbles at all locations in flotation tanks however our measurement system does not require sampling in tubes which can alter the size distribution and concentration of bubbles gulden et al 2018 the applied inline microscopy is based on an optical system on top of a rod where the focus is close to the lens thus our method is not restricted to thin geometries and results in high quality images even in the applied daf system with a high bubble density contrary inline imaging through the whole flotation tank fanaie and khiadani 2020 bubble column majumder et al 2006 or a viewing slit swart et al 2020 2022 can be restricted to thin tank column slit diameters and or low bubble densities however the mentioned existing inline methods are non invasive while the use of our microscope probe might possibly affect the measurement thus we took special care to ensure that the positioning of the microscope probe disturbed the flow as little as possible more precise the probe lens and clamp on reflector fig s2 was placed at the edge of the pipe through a t piece fig s4 despite the care the setup did result in a slight reduction of the pipe which might influence the fluid dynamics in our study bubbles in the pipe between the decompression valve and the daf tank were analyzed for the first time this further underlines the flexibility of the proposed approach the study shows that bubble coalescence along the pipe might lead to a decrease of the bubble concentration and an increase of the bubble size that leads to decreased surface areas of bubbles and might reduce flotation efficiency thus we suggest to reduce the pipe length between the decompression valve and the flotation tank although the aforementioned inline and online methods have not been used to investigate bubbles in the pipe before the daf tank they might also be adapted to this issue to determine size distributions a sufficient amount of samples need to be analyzed according to vigneau et al 1999 and rice et al 2013 more than 500 samples should be analyzed while we detected at least 3 207 bubbles per experiment in most experiments more than 10 000 bubbles were analyzed 4 conclusions our major findings include the following inline imaging enables the analysis of bubble size distributions and concentrations number of bubbles per image within minutes contrary to available techniques laser scattering laser diffraction ultrasound imaging through viewing glass sampling is not required and analysis can be conducted at all locations of flotation processes coalescence and dilution of microbubbles can be investigated based on image analysis pipeline compared to freshwater salt water inhibited coalescence all bubble size distributions were unimodal and can be described well with the burr xii distribution based on the developed method and results we suggest that future studies should focus on following issues the investigation of the evolution of microbubbles before they enter the flotation tank coalescence could reduce the available bubble surface area where impurities can attach agglomeration between bubbles and particles should be quantified and located as both can be visualized with inline microscopy validation and improvement of existing modeling approaches for the flow coalescence breakage and agglomeration of microbubbles in flotation plants through our developed method the required large and detailed data sets can be generated application of our developed method to investigate microbubbles in other processes such as fermentations chemical reactions decomposition of organic compounds and fouling

15501,bromamines i e monobromamine nh2br dibromamine nhbr2 and tribromamine nbr3 can be formed during oxidative treatment of waters containing bromide and ammonia the formation and decomposition of bromamines in aqueous solution was investigated and a comprehensive kinetic model of the bromine ammonia system was developed at 23 1 c determination of rate constants and model validation were primarily performed at ph 8 0 8 3 for subsequent application to seawater disinfection the rate constant of nhbr2 self decomposition was determined by second order rate law linearization with k9 5 5 0 8 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 10 the rate constant of nbr3 self decomposition increased proportionately to the concentration of hydroxide ions oh according to the equation k10 4 4 0 1 107 oh over the ph range 6 0 8 5 which gave k10 56 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 10 the rate constants of nhbr2 and nbr3 formation were obtained by fitting model predicted data to the experimental results and were found to be k3 2 3 0 2 104 m 1 s 1 and k5 4 0 0 6 103 m 1 s 1 respectively at ph 8 10 nbr3 was also found to react with nhbr2 with k11 3 4 0 2 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 10 a kinetic model was proposed based on these experimental rate constants and literature values which provided a good prediction of bromamines formation and decomposition for various initial bromine and ammonia concentrations the kinetic model was also used to accurately predict the total oxidant concentration and the speciation of bromamines during breakpoint bromination this study provides kinetic data to model more complex oxidative systems such as seawater chlorination in the presence of ammonia graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bromamines bromine oxidant breakpoint disinfection data availability data will be made available

kumar and margerum 1987 werschkun et al 2012 bromine hobr obr is readily formed in natural waters containing ammonia the presence of bromine leads to the formation of bromamines bromamines include three species monobromamine nh2br dibromamine nhbr2 and tribromamine nbr3 bromamines are formed by stepwise addition of bromine to ammonia according to the following equilibria 1 2 hobr n h 3 k 1 k 2

presented in table 1 the formation of nh2br has been thoroughly investigated and similar rate constants k1 ranging from 4 0 107 to 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 were determined in different experimental studies heeb et al 2017 inman and johnson 1984 wajon and morris 1982 heeb et al 2017 calculated a rate constant k2 of 1 7 s 1 for nh2br hydrolysis using the equilibrium constant obtained by soulard et al 1981 once formed nh2br can disproportionate into nh3 and nhbr2 which can react together to reform nh2br reactions 7 8 7 8 2 n h 2 br k 7 k 8 nhb r 2 n h 3 k 7 8 both reactions have been thoroughly investigated by lei et al 2004 and the rate constants k7 and k8 were found to be ph dependent in the ph range 6 5 9 5 in contrast to nh2br the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 have not been thoroughly studied there is no experimental rate constant for the formation of nhbr2 and nbr3 available in the literature the values reported in the literature were estimated based on chloramine formation haag and lietzke 1981 similar equilibrium constants k3 4 were obtained by hofmann and andrews 2001 and trogolo and arey 2017 while significantly different k5 6 values were determined by the same authors table 1 cromer et al 1979 reported that nhbr2 undergoes subsequent self decomposition according to reaction 9 9 2nhbr2 h2o n2 hobr 3h 3br k9 cromer et al 1979 determined a k9 value of 13 3 m 1 s 1 while a value of 8 9 m 1 s 1 was obtained by lei et al 2004 the kinetic of nhbr2 self decomposition was not dependent on ph lei et al 2004 and borate buffer concentration lei et al 2002 similar to nhbr2 lapointe et al 1975 reported that nbr3 self decomposed according to the following reaction reaction 10 10 2nbr3 3h2o n2 3hobr 3h 3br k10 a complex rate law involving hobr and oh concentrations was proposed by inman et al 1976 for reaction 10 in the ph range 6 8 the mechanism of the reaction was unclear and the rate constant could not be determined thoroughly since hobr in the rate expression varied over time cromer et al 1979 showed later that nbr3 can also react with nhbr2 reaction 11 but no rate constant has been reported in the literature 11 nbr3 nhbr2 2h2o n2 2hobr 3h 3br the level and distribution of bromamines are highly dependent on ph and bromine to ammonia molar ratio br n johnson and overby 1971 soulard et al 1981 at ph ranging from 6 5 to 8 5 and low br n 0 1 nh2br is the most stable and predominant species while nhbr2 predominantly forms at 0 1 br n 1 and nbr3 is the most abundant bromamine species at br n 3 johnson and overby 1971 soulard et al 1981 the evolution of residual total bromine i e bromamines and free bromine versus initial total bromine dose was first described by lapointe et al 1975 at ph 7 these curves are called breakpoint curves and the breakpoint value is defined as the stoichiometric amount of oxidant required to oxidize all ammonia to nitrogen gas n2 according to the overall reaction 12 the breakpoint value corresponds to br n molar ratio of 1 5 lapointe et al 1975 experimentally determined a br n molar ratio of 1 5 at 5 min and 1 7 at 30 min which was explained by the preferential formation of nhbr2 and its rapid decomposition at ph 7 12 3hobr 2nh3 n2 3br 3h 3h2o under typical drinking water conditions nh2br and nhbr2 were found at negligible concentrations compared to others halamines such as monochloramine nh2cl and bromochloramine nhbrcl allard et al 2018 hu et al 2020 however nh2br was formed at significant concentrations during ozonation of ammonium enriched drinking water for bromate inhibition haag et al 1984 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 furthermore due to the high concentration of bromide in seawater and ammonium concentration ranging from 2 µg l to 0 25 mg l péron and courtot coupez 1980 bromamines can be present at significant concentrations during seawater chlorination inman and johnson 1978 mensah et al 2022 péron and courtot coupez 1980 bromamines were found to be less stable and highly reactive with organic precursors compared to their chloramine analogues heeb et al 2017 pope and speitel 2008 simon et al 2015 which can result in higher oxidant demand and the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts pope and speitel 2008 simon et al 2015 although the formation and decomposition of bromamines have been studied for several decades there are still gaps that need to be addressed a comprehensive understanding of the kinetics of bromamines formation and decomposition over a wide range of experimental conditions is lacking this is essential to better manage the effectiveness of disinfection by controlling the concentration of the residual oxidant and to mitigate the formation of disinfection byproducts the objectives of the study were to determine the rate constants for the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 thereby validating a kinetic model for the bromine ammonia system most of the experiments were performed at ph ranging from 8 0 to 8 3 to mimic chlorine treatment of ammonia containing seawater 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and analytical methods all solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals ultra pure water 18 2 mω cm was supplied by a merck purification system hypobromite stock solutions 1 4 2 0 10 2 m were prepared by reacting naocl 10 15 active chlorine with bromide added as potassium bromide kbr at a molar ratio br cl of 1 05 and ph 11 adjusted with naoh farkas et al 1949 the concentration of the stock solution was determined by direct measurement of the stock solution at 329 nm for obr ɛobr 332 m 1 cm 1 or by iodometric titration in acid solution to form triiodide ion i3 klassen et al 1994 which was analysed at 351 nm using ɛi₃ 26 900 m 1 cm 1 cimetiere et al 2009 both methods gave similar results free bromine hobr obr and bromamines nh2br nhbr2 and nbr3 spectra were determined with a shimadzu uv pharmaspec 1700 spectrophotometer or safas uvmc2 spectrophotometer concentration of total oxidant the sum of free bromine and bromamines was determined by iodometric titration concentrations of bromine species in mixture were determined by solving equations for total oxidant and beer lambert law at selected wavelengths using the corresponding molar absorptivities of the different bromine species see text s1 fig s1 and table s1 for more details a thermo scientific orion star a211 ph metre was used for ph measurements and was calibrated daily with ph 4 7 and 10 standard solutions membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims measurements for speciation of bromine during breakpoint experiments were performed with a mims 2000 mikrolab aarhus a s denmark the membrane inlet temperature was set to 40 c and the sample flow rate to 2 ml min 1 the bromamines were identified and quantified in selected ion monitoring sim mode based on their mass to charge ratio m z after electron ionization ei calibration of mims signals were performed using bromamine solutions previously standardized by uv visible spectrophotometry see hu et al 2020 and mensah et al 2022 for details signals at m z 97 lod 1 44 µm 175 lod 0 84 µm and 253 lod 0 23 µm were used for nh2br nhbr2 and nbr3 quantification respectively while there is no interference on the nbr3 signal at m z 253 in pure aqueous solution fragments ions of nbr3 contributed to signals at m z 97 and 175 mensah et al 2022 likewise fragment ion of nhbr2 contributed to the signal at m z 97 hu et al 2020 nh2br can be present in mixture with nhbr2 and nhbr2 can be present in mixture with nbr3 however nh2br cannot be present when nbr3 is formed lapointe et al 1975 lei et al 2004 therefore nh2br was quantified by subtracting the contribution of nhbr2 and nhbr2 was quantified by subtracting the contribution of nbr3 2 3 experimental procedures the kinetics of bromamines formation and decomposition were studied in batch reactor amber bottle at room temperature 23 1 c for total reaction times ranging from 20 to 60 min reactions were initiated by adding small volumes 0 1 1 ml of hypobromite stock solution to 250 ml of ammonia buffered solution after 10 s of stirring aliquots were withdrawn at selected time intervals for spectrophotometric measurements and iodometric titration kinetic experiments were performed in duplicate for ph range 5 9 8 5 and for various initial concentrations of bromine 0 05 2 mm and ammonia 0 028 0 7 mm corresponding to br n molar ratio of 0 1 10 phosphate buffer 10 100 mm was used for ph 8 and borate buffer 5 50 mm for ph 8 details of all experimental conditions are presented in table s2 in the supplementary information experiments for breakpoint curves determination were carried out at ph 8 0 8 1 with 69 µm 1 25 mg nh4 l ammonia 0 0 42 mm 0 30 mg cl2 l free bromine or free chlorine and reaction times of 5 and 30 min the concentration of total oxidant i e total bromine or total chlorine was determined by iodometric titration the speciation of bromamines for bromine breakpoint experiments was obtained by mims because bromamines could not be analysed at low concentration by uv spectrophotometry 2 4 kinetic modelling and rate constants determination kintecus software ianni 2017 was used for kinetic modelling and fitting rate constants to experimental data bromamine concentrations as a function of time the fittings were performed with a least squares method using powell or nelder mead algorithms ianni 2017 that minimize the sum of squared residuals between experimental data and model predictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of a kinetic model for the bromine ammonia system table 2 shows the reactions used in the kinetic model with their corresponding rate constant at ph 8 1 from the literature or determined in this study the proposed model for the bromine ammonia system includes the formation and hydrolysis reactions of bromamines reactions 1 to 6 halogen transfer between nh2br and nhbr2 reactions 7 and 8 decomposition reactions of bromamines into bromine and nitrogen n2 reactions 9 to 11 and equilibria of bromine reaction 13 and ammonia reaction 14 these reactions were previously used in a model proposed by haag and lietzke 1981 table s3 however preliminary kinetic modelling showed that the predicted values were significantly different from our experimental results at ph 8 fig s2 highlighting the need to experimentally determine rate constants instead of estimating them by analogy with rate constants of chloramines rate constants of nh2br formation reaction 1 and hydrolysis reaction 2 were taken from heeb et al 2017 rate constants of halogen transfer for nh2br reaction 7 and between nhbr2 and nbr3 reaction 8 were calculated from lei et al 2004 for our conditions the rate constants of nhbr2 and nbr3 formation reaction 3 and 5 and decomposition of nbr3 by nhbr2 reaction 11 were determined by fitting modelled data to our experimental values the rate constants of hydrolysis reaction 4 and 6 were deduced from equilibrium constants given in the literature the rate constants for self decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 reaction 9 and 10 were determined by linearization of experimental data bromamine concentrations as a function of time according to the second order rate law see next sections for details 3 1 1 kinetic modelling of nh2br and nhbr2 formation and decomposition at br n 2 fig 1 presents the experimental results for the formation and decomposition of nh2br and nhbr2 at br n molar ratio of 0 1 0 4 and 1 5 at ph 8 10 8 15 under these conditions nhbr2 was the predominant species i e after 10 min for br n 0 1 all free bromine was converted to bromamines and nbr3 was not detected nh2br was formed in less than 20 s and then decreased results also showed that the kinetics of nhbr2 formation and decomposition increased when the br n ratio increased from 0 1 to 1 5 the experimental results were used to determine the rate constants of nhbr2 formation reaction 3 and decomposition reaction 9 nhbr2 decomposition the linearization of the experimental results 1 nhbr2 versus time fig s3 confirmed that nhbr2 self decomposition is a second order reaction with respect to nhbr2 for br n ratios of 0 1 and 0 4 in agreement with previous studies cromer et al 1979 lei et al 2004 for br n 1 5 kinetic results could not be linearized according to the second order rate law fig s3c which was explained by the presence of nbr3 contributing to nhbr2 decomposition through reaction 11 therefore the rate constant of nhbr2 self decomposition was calculated using eq 15 and considering only br n 0 1 and 0 4 15 d nhb r 2 dt 2 k 9 nhb r 2 2 similar slopes were obtained for br n 0 1 and br n 0 4 fig s3a and b and an average value of 5 5 0 8 m 1 s 1 was determined for the rate constant k9 at ph 8 1 i e half the slope of the linear plot 1 nhbr2 versus time fig s3a and b this value was about two times lower than those reported previously i e 8 9 m 1 s 1 from lei et al 2004 and 13 3 m 1 s 1 from cromer et al 1979 nhbr2 formation the rate constant k3 for the formation of nhbr2 reaction 3 was fitted to experimental results conditions 1 3 in table s1 on kintecus and considering reactions 1 3 and 7 9 table 2 an average value of k3 2 3 0 2 104 m 1 s 1 was obtained for the 3 different br n ratios fig 1 which was about one order of magnitude lower than the value estimated by haag and lietzke 1981 the k3 value obtained in this study for the formation of nhbr2 was about two orders of magnitude higher than dichloramine nhcl2 formation jafvert and valentine 1992 morris and isaac 1983 considering the determined k3 value and the equilibrium constant of nhbr2 k3 4 6 0 108 m 1 hofmann and andrews 2001 trogolo and arey 2017 a low rate constant k4 3 9 10 5 s 1 for nhbr2 hydrolysis was then calculated k4 k3 k3 4 incorporating reaction 4 in the kinetic modelling did not affect the predicted values the formation and decomposition of nh2br and nhbr2 were in close agreement with values predicted by the model for br n 0 1 and br n 0 4 fig 1 3 1 2 kinetic modelling of nbr3 formation and decomposition for br n 2 fig 2 shows the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 nbr3 and hobr obr at br n molar ratios of 2 3 5 8 and 10 and ph 8 0 8 2 as shown in fig 2 nbr3 became the predominant bromamine species for br n 2 at br n 2 nhbr2 was rapidly formed and decomposed in less than a minute while nbr3 was produced during the same timeframe and then gradually decomposed see uv spectra in fig s4 increasing the br n ratio from 3 to 10 led to a higher formation and stability of nbr3 in a first step free bromine was quickly consumed when ammonia was added to the solution and in a second step it was produced from the decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 reactions 9 11 table 2 nbr3 self decomposition the rate constant k10 of nbr3 self decomposition reaction 10 was determined for br n 2 i e in presence of free bromine only as previously reported and in contrast to nhbr2 the decomposition of nbr3 was found to be ph dependent inman et al 1976 lapointe et al 1975 therefore additional experiments were performed at ph ranging from 5 9 to 8 5 and br n 5 conditions 10 15 in table s1 see fig s5 for results for all ph values the rate constants k10 were calculated by second order rate law linearization inman et al 1976 fig s6 according to eq 16 16 d nb r 3 dt 2 k 10 nb r 3 2 the resulting values of k10 ranged from 1 9 m 1 s 1 for ph 5 9 to 1 2 102 m 1 s 1 for ph 8 5 in the ph range 5 9 8 5 fig s7a shows that k10 values followed an exponential shape with increasing ph it was found that the reaction was first order with respect to oh concentration by plotting k10 vs oh fig s7b suggesting that nbr3 self decomposition was catalysed by oh a third order rate constant of 4 4 107 m 2 s 1 was determined as the slope of the linear plot of k10 values versus oh concentration fig s7b it was verified that phosphate and borate buffers did not show a significant effect on nbr3 decomposition fig s8a and s8b furthermore and in contrast to inman et al 1976 we did not observe that an excess of free bromine affect the self decomposition of nbr3 i e for bromine concentrations 100 µm results in fig 2 showed that the experimental results for nbr3 decomposition and the subsequent formation of hobr obr were in close agreement with values predicted by the model for all br n ratio nbr3 formation the rate constant k5 of nbr3 formation reaction 5 was fitted to the experimental results conditions 4 6 11 13 and 14 in table s1 using reactions 1 5 and 9 10 table 2 the least square fittings using kintecus gave an average rate constant k5 4 0 0 6 103 m 1 s 1 this rate constant was about one order of magnitude higher than the value estimated by haag and lietzke 1981 and about three orders of magnitude higher than trichloramine ncl3 formation morris and isaac 1983 similar to nhbr2 a rate constant k6 5 7 10 4 s 1 for nbr3 hydrolysis was calculated from k5 and the equilibrium constant of nbr3 obtained by hofmann and andrews 2001 k5 6 6 8 106 m 1 as shown in fig 2a e a good prediction of the experimental data was obtained slight and constant overestimations of the experimental bromine concentrations of about 12 max were observed for br n 5 fig 2c d and e these deviations could not be clearly explained they may be due to e g bromine consuming impurities errors in determination of oxidant speciation by spectrophotometry the model was also run using k6 3 1 10 7 s 1 calculated from the equilibrium constant determined by trogolo and arey 2017 k5 6 1 3 1010 m 1 however this led to a slight overestimation of nbr3 stability reaction between nbr3 and nhbr2 at br n 2 fig 2a both nbr3 and nhbr2 were present and can react with each other according to reaction 11 cromer et al 1979 haag and lietzke 1981 modelling without considering reaction 11 and k11 value in the kinetic model significantly overestimated nhbr2 and nbr3 concentrations see fig s9 in si the rate constant k11 was obtained by fitting the modelled data to the experimental results experiments 4 and 5 in table s2 and by considering reactions 9 10 and 11 table 2 at ph 8 1 fitting using kintecus gave k11 3 4 0 2 103 m 1 s 1 good prediction of experimental results was also obtained for br n of 1 5 fig 1c by incorporating reaction 11 and k11 value in the kinetic model for this condition br n of 1 5 experiment 3 in table s2 modelling results showed that nbr3 was present at a maximum concentration of 2 5 µm at 10 s i e concentration below detection limit of uv spectrophotometry 3 2 effect of bromine and ammonia initial concentrations on bromamines formation and decomposition fig 3 shows the comparison between experimental results and modelled data at ph 8 0 8 2 for various bromine and ammonia concentrations fig 3a b hobr 0 0 05 0 2 mm nh4 0 13 0 48 mm for nh2br and nhbr2 and fig 3c hobr 0 0 27 1 0 mm nh4 0 054 0 2 mm for nbr3 as shown in fig 3 increasing the initial concentration of bromine and ammonia while keeping br n constant br n 0 4 for nh2br and nhbr2 and br n 5 for nbr3 resulted in an increased rate of formation and decomposition for all bromamines nh2br nhbr2 and nbr3 the model correctly predicted the time profiles of bromamines for all initial reactant concentrations this indicates that the model can be used to accurately predict bromamines formation and decomposition over a wide range of bromine and ammonia concentrations at ph 8 0 8 3 to further validate the accuracy of the model experimental data obtained from uv spectrophotometry by lapointe et al 1975 and lei et al 2004 were compared with the model predictions at ph 8 fig s10 in si the good agreement between predicted and experimental data from the literature showed that the model can be used to adequately predict the formation and decomposition of bromamines for various br n and low to high concentrations of bromine and ammonia at ph 8 0 results obtained at ph 8 0 showed significant deviations from the predicted values see fig s11 in si for examples at ph 6 4 and 7 0 suggesting that some reactions are ph dependent thus further studies are needed to validate the model at other ph values 3 3 modelling breakpoint bromination and comparison with breakpoint chlorination experimental breakpoint curve was determined for the bromine ammonia system for 5 and 30 min contact times 1 25 mg nh4 l 69 µm and ph 8 0 8 1 and was compared to the model predicted curve fig 4 a for comparison breakpoint curves were also obtained for the chlorine ammonia system for similar conditions fig 4b predicted data for breakpoint bromination were obtained using the model presented in table 2 while predicted data for chlorination were obtained using model proposed by jafvert and valentine 1992 fig 4c and e present the experimental and predicted concentrations of bromine species at 5 min and 30 min contact times respectively i e free bromine and bromamines while fig 4d and f present the model prediction of chlorine species at 5 min and 30 min contact times i e free chlorine and chloramines the experimental results of bromine speciation fig 4c and e were obtained by mims breakpoint curves for bromination fig 4a c and e and chlorination fig 4b d and f could be divided into two parts a first part before the breakpoint value and the second part above the breakpoint value in the bromine system the breakpoint value was observed at a br n molar ratio of 1 8 i e 9 1 mg cl2 mg n at 5 min reaction time and a br n of 1 5 i e 7 6 mg cl2 mg n at 30 min reaction time these values were similar to those obtained by lapointe et al 1975 at ph 7 for the same reaction times in the chlorine system breakpoint was achieved at cl n molar ratio of 1 5 i e 7 6 mg cl2 l of initial chlorine for both 5 and 30 min reaction times in the first part the oxidant was present as combined chlorine or bromine the combined bromine fig 4c e consisted of nhbr2 while the combined chlorine consisted mainly of the more stable monochloramine nh2cl fig 4d f therefore in the bromine ammonia system total residual bromine fig 4a was lower at 30 min compared to 5 min contact time due to the decomposition of nhbr2 these results confirmed the previous assumptions by lapointe et al 1975 and explained the differences between the breakpoint values at 30 min and 5 min fig 4a in the chlorine ammonia system the stability of nh2cl explained the similar residual chlorine concentrations obtained for 5 and 30 min contact times fig 4b for cl n 1 i e 5 0 mg cl2 mg n around the breakpoint value fig 4b total residual chlorine was lower at 30 min compared to 5 min contact time due to the formation and rapid decomposition of nhcl2 fig 4d f in the second part i e above the breakpoint the oxidant was present mainly as free bromine fig 4c e or chlorine fig 4d f nbr3 was present at higher concentration in the bromine ammonia system fig 4c e compared to ncl3 which was expected to be formed at very low concentrations at ph 8 fig 4d f fig 4 shows that the model predicted data for total bromine and speciation of bromamines were in good agreement with the experimental results the reactions and rate constants used in the model table 2 can accurately predict the bromine breakpoint curves and both kinetics and speciation of bromine species at ph 8 0 4 conclusions the bromine ammonia system was investigated in pure aqueous solution rate constants for the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 were determined and a comprehensive kinetic model was proposed that well predicted the formation and decomposition of bromamines at ph 8 0 8 3 for a wide range of initial concentrations and reaction times these results provide a better understanding of the chemistry of bromamines formed during oxidative treatments of bromide and ammonia containing waters the experimental results and model prediction indicated that significant amounts of nbr3 were present in mixture with free bromine above the breakpoint the presence of nbr3 could affect the effectiveness of disinfection but also the formation of disinfection byproducts due to the low reactivity of nbr3 with natural organic matter mensah et al 2022 this study provides a step further to the kinetic modelling of more complex systems such as seawater chlorination in the presence of ammonia however others oxidizing species such as bromochloramines i e nhbrcl nbr2cl and nbrcl2 need to be considered when waters containing ammonia and bromide are chlorinated mensah et al 2022 the model needs to be further improved by determining rate constants of formation and decomposition of these species this will help to better simulate oxidant residual and speciation during brackish seawater chlorination more research is also needed to evaluate the reactivity of nh2br and nhbr2 with natural organic matter in order to better understand their behaviour in natural waters and their

15501,bromamines i e monobromamine nh2br dibromamine nhbr2 and tribromamine nbr3 can be formed during oxidative treatment of waters containing bromide and ammonia the formation and decomposition of bromamines in aqueous solution was investigated and a comprehensive kinetic model of the bromine ammonia system was developed at 23 1 c determination of rate constants and model validation were primarily performed at ph 8 0 8 3 for subsequent application to seawater disinfection the rate constant of nhbr2 self decomposition was determined by second order rate law linearization with k9 5 5 0 8 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 10 the rate constant of nbr3 self decomposition increased proportionately to the concentration of hydroxide ions oh according to the equation k10 4 4 0 1 107 oh over the ph range 6 0 8 5 which gave k10 56 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 10 the rate constants of nhbr2 and nbr3 formation were obtained by fitting model predicted data to the experimental results and were found to be k3 2 3 0 2 104 m 1 s 1 and k5 4 0 0 6 103 m 1 s 1 respectively at ph 8 10 nbr3 was also found to react with nhbr2 with k11 3 4 0 2 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 10 a kinetic model was proposed based on these experimental rate constants and literature values which provided a good prediction of bromamines formation and decomposition for various initial bromine and ammonia concentrations the kinetic model was also used to accurately predict the total oxidant concentration and the speciation of bromamines during breakpoint bromination this study provides kinetic data to model more complex oxidative systems such as

presented in table 1 the formation of nh2br has been thoroughly investigated and similar rate constants k1 ranging from 4 0 107 to 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 were determined in different experimental studies heeb et al 2017 inman and johnson 1984 wajon and morris 1982 heeb et al 2017 calculated a rate constant k2 of 1 7 s 1 for nh2br hydrolysis using the equilibrium constant obtained by soulard et al 1981

been thoroughly studied there is no experimental rate constant for the formation of nhbr2 and nbr3 available in the literature the values reported in the literature were estimated based on chloramine formation haag and lietzke 1981 similar equilibrium constants k3 4 were obtained by hofmann and andrews 2001 and trogolo and arey 2017 while significantly different k5 6 values were determined by the

similar to nhbr2 lapointe et al 1975 reported that nbr3 self decomposed according to the following reaction reaction 10 10 2nbr3 3h2o n2 3hobr 3h 3br k10 a complex rate law involving hobr and oh concentrations was proposed by inman et al 1976 for reaction 10 in the ph range 6 8 the mechanism of the reaction was unclear and the rate constant could not be determined thoroughly since hobr in the rate expression varied over time cromer et al 1979 showed later that nbr3 can also react with nhbr2 reaction 11 but no rate constant has been reported in the literature 11 nbr3 nhbr2 2h2o n2 2hobr 3h

1 nh2br is the most stable and predominant species while nhbr2 predominantly forms at 0 1 br n 1 and nbr3 is the most abundant bromamine species at br n 3 johnson and overby 1971 soulard et al 1981 the evolution of residual total bromine i e bromamines and free bromine versus initial total bromine dose was first described by lapointe et al 1975 at ph 7 these curves are called breakpoint curves and the breakpoint value is defined as the stoichiometric amount of oxidant required to oxidize all ammonia to nitrogen gas n2 according to the overall reaction 12 the breakpoint value corresponds to br n molar ratio of 1 5 lapointe et al 1975 experimentally determined a br n molar ratio of 1 5 at 5 min and 1 7 at 30 min which was explained by the preferential formation of nhbr2 and its rapid decomposition at ph 7 12 3hobr 2nh3 n2 3br 3h 3h2o under typical drinking water conditions nh2br and nhbr2 were found at negligible concentrations compared to others halamines such as monochloramine nh2cl and bromochloramine nhbrcl allard et al 2018 hu et al 2020 however nh2br was formed at significant concentrations during ozonation of ammonium enriched drinking water for bromate inhibition haag et al 1984 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 furthermore due to the high concentration of bromide in seawater and ammonium concentration ranging from 2 µg l to 0 25 mg l péron and courtot coupez 1980 bromamines can be present at significant concentrations during seawater chlorination inman and johnson 1978 mensah et al 2022 péron and courtot coupez 1980 bromamines were found to be less stable and highly reactive with organic precursors compared to their chloramine analogues heeb et al 2017 pope and speitel 2008 simon et al 2015 which can result in higher oxidant demand and the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts pope and speitel 2008 simon et al 2015 although the formation and decomposition of bromamines have been studied for several decades there are still gaps that need to be addressed a comprehensive understanding of the kinetics of bromamines formation and decomposition over a wide range of experimental conditions is lacking this is essential to better manage the effectiveness of disinfection by controlling the concentration of the residual oxidant and to mitigate the formation of disinfection byproducts the objectives of the study were to determine the rate constants for the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 thereby validating a kinetic model for the bromine ammonia system most of the experiments were performed at ph ranging from 8 0 to 8 3 to mimic chlorine treatment of ammonia containing seawater 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and analytical methods all solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals ultra pure water 18 2 mω cm was supplied by a merck purification system hypobromite stock solutions 1 4 2 0 10 2 m were prepared by reacting naocl 10 15 active chlorine with bromide added as potassium bromide kbr at a molar ratio br cl of 1 05 and ph 11 adjusted with naoh farkas et al 1949 the concentration of the stock solution was determined by direct measurement of the stock solution at 329 nm for obr ɛobr 332 m 1 cm 1 or by iodometric titration in acid solution to form triiodide ion i3 klassen et al 1994 which was analysed at 351 nm using ɛi₃ 26 900 m 1 cm 1 cimetiere et al 2009 both methods gave similar results free bromine hobr obr and bromamines nh2br nhbr2 and nbr3 spectra were determined with a shimadzu uv pharmaspec 1700 spectrophotometer or safas uvmc2 spectrophotometer concentration of total oxidant the sum of free bromine and bromamines was determined by iodometric titration concentrations of bromine species in mixture were determined by solving equations for total oxidant and beer lambert law at selected wavelengths using the corresponding molar absorptivities of the different bromine species see text s1 fig s1 and table s1 for more details a thermo scientific orion star a211 ph metre was used for ph measurements and was calibrated daily with ph 4 7 and 10 standard solutions membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims measurements for speciation of bromine during breakpoint experiments were performed with a mims 2000 mikrolab aarhus a s denmark the membrane inlet temperature was set to 40 c and the sample flow rate to 2 ml min 1 the bromamines were identified and quantified in selected ion monitoring sim mode based on their mass to charge ratio m z after electron ionization ei calibration of mims signals were performed using bromamine solutions previously standardized by uv visible spectrophotometry see hu et al 2020 and mensah et al 2022 for details signals at m z 97 lod 1 44 µm 175 lod 0 84 µm and 253 lod 0 23 µm were used for nh2br nhbr2 and nbr3 quantification respectively while there is no interference on the nbr3 signal at m z 253 in pure aqueous solution fragments ions of nbr3 contributed to signals at m z 97 and 175 mensah et al 2022 likewise fragment ion of nhbr2 contributed to the signal at m z 97 hu et al 2020 nh2br can be present in mixture with nhbr2 and nhbr2 can be present in mixture with nbr3 however nh2br cannot be present when nbr3 is formed lapointe et al 1975 lei et al 2004 therefore nh2br was quantified by subtracting the contribution of nhbr2 and nhbr2 was quantified by subtracting the contribution of nbr3 2 3 experimental procedures the kinetics of bromamines formation and decomposition were studied in batch reactor amber bottle at room temperature 23 1 c for total reaction times ranging from 20 to 60 min reactions were initiated by adding small volumes 0 1 1 ml of hypobromite stock solution to 250 ml of ammonia buffered solution after 10 s of stirring aliquots were withdrawn at selected time intervals for spectrophotometric measurements and iodometric titration kinetic experiments were performed in duplicate for ph range 5 9 8 5 and for various initial concentrations of bromine 0 05 2 mm and ammonia 0 028 0 7 mm corresponding to br n molar ratio of 0 1 10 phosphate buffer 10 100 mm was used for ph 8 and borate buffer 5 50 mm for ph 8 details of all experimental conditions are presented in table s2 in the supplementary information experiments for breakpoint curves determination were carried out at ph 8 0 8 1 with 69 µm 1 25 mg nh4 l ammonia 0 0 42 mm 0 30 mg cl2 l free bromine or free chlorine and reaction times of 5 and 30 min the concentration of total oxidant i e total bromine or total chlorine was determined by iodometric titration the speciation of bromamines for bromine breakpoint experiments was obtained by mims because bromamines could not be analysed at low concentration by uv spectrophotometry 2 4 kinetic modelling and rate constants determination kintecus software ianni 2017 was used for kinetic modelling and fitting rate constants to experimental data bromamine concentrations as a function of time the fittings were performed with a least squares method using powell or nelder mead algorithms ianni 2017 that minimize the sum of squared residuals between experimental data and model predictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of a kinetic model for the bromine ammonia system table 2 shows the reactions used in the kinetic model with their corresponding rate constant at ph 8 1 from the literature or determined in this study the proposed model for the bromine ammonia system includes the formation and hydrolysis reactions of bromamines reactions 1 to 6 halogen transfer between nh2br and nhbr2 reactions 7 and 8 decomposition reactions of bromamines into bromine and nitrogen n2 reactions 9 to 11 and equilibria of bromine reaction 13 and ammonia reaction 14 these reactions were previously used in a model proposed by haag and lietzke 1981 table s3 however preliminary kinetic modelling showed that the predicted values were significantly different from our experimental results at ph 8 fig s2 highlighting the need to experimentally determine rate constants instead of estimating them by analogy with rate constants of chloramines rate constants of nh2br formation reaction 1 and hydrolysis reaction 2 were taken from heeb et al 2017 rate constants of halogen transfer for nh2br reaction 7 and between nhbr2 and nbr3 reaction 8 were calculated from lei et al 2004 for our conditions the rate constants of nhbr2 and nbr3 formation reaction 3 and 5 and decomposition of nbr3 by nhbr2 reaction 11 were determined by fitting modelled data to our experimental values the rate constants of hydrolysis reaction 4 and 6 were deduced from equilibrium constants given in the literature the rate constants for self decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 reaction 9 and 10 were determined by linearization of experimental data bromamine concentrations as a function of time according to the second order rate law see next sections for details 3 1 1 kinetic modelling of nh2br and nhbr2 formation and decomposition at br n 2 fig 1 presents the experimental results for the formation and decomposition of nh2br and nhbr2 at br n molar ratio of 0 1 0 4 and 1 5 at ph 8 10 8 15 under these conditions nhbr2 was the predominant species i e after 10 min for br n 0 1 all free bromine was converted to bromamines and nbr3 was not detected nh2br was formed in less than 20 s and then decreased results also showed that the kinetics of nhbr2 formation and decomposition increased when the br n ratio increased from 0 1 to 1 5 the experimental results were used to determine the rate constants of nhbr2 formation reaction 3 and decomposition reaction 9 nhbr2 decomposition the linearization of the experimental results 1 nhbr2 versus time fig s3 confirmed that nhbr2 self decomposition is a second order reaction with respect to nhbr2 for br n ratios of 0 1 and 0 4 in agreement with previous studies cromer et al 1979 lei et al 2004 for br n 1 5 kinetic results could not be linearized according to the second order rate law fig s3c which was explained by the presence of nbr3 contributing to nhbr2 decomposition through reaction 11 therefore the rate constant of nhbr2 self decomposition was calculated using eq 15 and considering only br n 0 1 and 0 4 15 d nhb r 2 dt 2 k 9 nhb r 2 2 similar slopes were obtained for br n 0 1 and br n 0 4 fig s3a and b and an average value of 5 5 0 8 m 1 s 1 was determined for the rate constant k9 at ph 8 1 i e half the slope of the linear plot 1 nhbr2 versus time fig s3a and b this value was about two times lower than those reported previously i e 8 9 m 1 s 1 from lei et al 2004 and 13 3 m 1 s 1 from cromer et al 1979 nhbr2 formation the rate constant k3 for the formation of nhbr2 reaction 3 was fitted to experimental results conditions 1 3 in table s1 on kintecus and considering reactions 1 3 and 7 9 table 2 an average value of k3 2 3 0 2 104 m 1 s 1 was obtained for the 3 different br n ratios fig 1 which was about one order of magnitude lower than the value estimated by haag and lietzke 1981 the k3 value obtained in this study for the formation of nhbr2 was about two orders of magnitude higher than dichloramine nhcl2 formation jafvert and valentine 1992 morris and isaac 1983 considering the determined k3 value and the equilibrium constant of nhbr2 k3 4 6 0 108 m 1 hofmann and andrews 2001 trogolo and arey 2017 a low rate constant k4 3 9 10 5 s 1 for nhbr2 hydrolysis was then calculated k4 k3 k3 4 incorporating reaction 4 in the kinetic modelling did not affect the predicted values the formation and decomposition of nh2br and nhbr2 were in close agreement with values predicted by the model for br n 0 1 and br n 0 4 fig 1 3 1 2 kinetic modelling of nbr3 formation and decomposition for br n 2 fig 2 shows the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 nbr3 and hobr obr at br n molar ratios of 2 3 5 8 and 10 and ph 8 0 8 2 as shown in fig 2 nbr3 became the predominant bromamine species for br n 2 at br n 2 nhbr2 was rapidly formed and decomposed in less than a minute while nbr3 was produced during the same timeframe and then gradually decomposed see uv spectra in fig s4 increasing the br n ratio from 3 to 10 led to a higher formation and stability of nbr3 in a first step free bromine was quickly consumed when ammonia was added to the solution and in a second step it was produced from the decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 reactions 9 11 table 2 nbr3 self decomposition the rate constant k10 of nbr3 self decomposition reaction 10 was determined for br n 2 i e in presence of free bromine only as previously reported and in contrast to nhbr2 the decomposition of nbr3 was found to be ph dependent inman et al 1976 lapointe et al 1975 therefore additional experiments were performed at ph ranging from 5 9 to 8 5 and br n 5 conditions 10 15 in table s1 see fig s5 for results for all ph values the rate constants k10 were calculated by second order rate law linearization inman et al 1976 fig s6 according to eq 16 16 d nb r 3 dt 2 k 10 nb r 3 2 the resulting values of k10 ranged from 1 9 m 1 s 1 for ph 5 9 to 1 2 102 m 1 s 1 for ph 8 5 in the ph range 5 9 8 5 fig s7a shows that k10 values followed an exponential shape with increasing ph it was found that the reaction was first order with respect to oh concentration by plotting k10 vs oh fig s7b suggesting that nbr3 self decomposition was catalysed by oh a third order rate constant of 4 4 107 m 2 s 1 was determined as the slope of the linear plot of k10 values versus oh concentration fig s7b it was verified that phosphate and borate buffers did not show a significant effect on nbr3 decomposition fig s8a and s8b furthermore and in contrast to inman et al 1976 we did not observe that an excess of free bromine affect the self decomposition of nbr3 i e for bromine concentrations 100 µm results in fig 2 showed that the experimental results for nbr3 decomposition and the subsequent formation of hobr obr were in close agreement with values predicted by the model for all br n ratio nbr3 formation the rate constant k5 of nbr3 formation reaction 5 was fitted to the experimental results conditions 4 6 11 13 and 14 in table s1 using reactions 1 5 and 9 10 table 2 the least square fittings using kintecus gave an average rate constant k5 4 0 0 6 103 m 1 s 1 this rate constant was about one order of magnitude higher than the value estimated by haag and lietzke 1981 and about three orders of magnitude higher than trichloramine ncl3 formation morris and isaac 1983 similar to nhbr2 a rate constant k6 5 7 10 4 s 1 for nbr3 hydrolysis was calculated from k5 and the equilibrium constant of nbr3 obtained by hofmann and andrews 2001 k5 6 6 8 106 m 1 as shown in fig 2a e a good prediction of the experimental data was obtained slight and constant overestimations of the experimental bromine concentrations of about 12 max were observed for br n 5 fig 2c d and e these deviations could not be clearly explained they may be due to e g bromine consuming impurities errors in determination of oxidant speciation by spectrophotometry the model was also run using k6 3 1 10 7 s 1 calculated from the equilibrium constant determined by trogolo and arey 2017 k5 6 1 3 1010 m 1 however this led to a slight overestimation of nbr3 stability reaction between nbr3 and nhbr2 at br n 2 fig 2a both nbr3 and nhbr2 were present and can react with each other according to reaction 11 cromer et al 1979 haag and lietzke 1981 modelling without considering reaction 11 and k11 value in the kinetic model significantly overestimated nhbr2 and nbr3 concentrations see fig s9 in si the rate constant k11 was obtained by fitting the modelled data to the experimental results experiments 4 and 5 in table s2 and by considering reactions 9 10 and 11 table 2 at ph 8 1 fitting using kintecus gave k11 3 4 0 2 103 m 1 s 1 good prediction of experimental results was also obtained for br n of 1 5 fig 1c by incorporating reaction 11 and k11 value in the kinetic model for this condition br n of 1 5 experiment 3 in table s2 modelling results showed that nbr3 was present at a maximum concentration of 2 5 µm at 10 s i e concentration below detection limit of uv spectrophotometry 3 2 effect of bromine and ammonia initial concentrations on bromamines formation and decomposition fig 3 shows the comparison between experimental results and modelled data at ph 8 0 8 2 for various bromine and ammonia concentrations fig 3a b hobr 0 0 05 0 2 mm nh4 0 13 0 48 mm for nh2br and nhbr2 and fig 3c hobr 0 0 27 1 0 mm nh4 0 054 0 2 mm for nbr3 as shown in fig 3 increasing the initial concentration of bromine and ammonia while keeping br n constant br n 0 4 for nh2br and nhbr2 and br n 5 for nbr3 resulted in an increased rate of formation and decomposition for all bromamines nh2br nhbr2 and nbr3 the model correctly predicted the time profiles of bromamines for all initial reactant concentrations this indicates that the model can be used to accurately predict bromamines formation and decomposition over a wide range of bromine and ammonia concentrations at ph 8 0 8 3 to further validate the accuracy of the model experimental data obtained from uv spectrophotometry by lapointe et al 1975 and lei et al 2004 were compared with the model predictions at ph 8 fig s10 in si the good agreement between predicted and experimental data from the literature showed that the model can be used to adequately predict the formation and decomposition of bromamines for various br n and low to high concentrations of bromine and ammonia at ph 8 0 results obtained at ph 8 0 showed significant deviations from the predicted values see fig s11 in si for examples at ph 6 4 and 7 0 suggesting that some reactions are ph dependent thus further studies are needed to validate the model at other ph values 3 3 modelling breakpoint bromination and comparison with breakpoint chlorination experimental breakpoint curve was determined for the bromine ammonia system for 5 and 30 min contact times 1 25 mg nh4 l 69 µm and ph 8 0 8 1 and was compared to the model predicted curve fig 4 a for comparison breakpoint curves were also obtained for the chlorine ammonia system for similar conditions fig 4b predicted data for breakpoint bromination were obtained using the model presented in table 2 while predicted data for chlorination were obtained using model proposed by jafvert and valentine 1992 fig 4c and e present the experimental and predicted concentrations of bromine species at 5 min and 30 min contact times respectively i e free bromine and bromamines while fig 4d and f present the model prediction of chlorine species at 5 min and 30 min contact times i e free chlorine and chloramines the experimental results of bromine speciation fig 4c and e were obtained by mims breakpoint curves for bromination fig 4a c and e and chlorination fig 4b d and f could be divided into two parts a first part before the breakpoint value and the second part above the breakpoint value in the bromine system the breakpoint value was observed at a br n molar ratio of 1 8 i e 9 1 mg cl2 mg n at 5 min reaction time and a br n of 1 5 i e 7 6 mg cl2 mg n at 30 min reaction time these values were similar to those obtained by lapointe et al 1975 at ph 7 for the same reaction times in the chlorine system breakpoint was achieved at cl n molar ratio of 1 5 i e 7 6 mg cl2 l of initial chlorine for both 5 and 30 min reaction times in the first part the oxidant was present as combined chlorine or bromine the combined bromine fig 4c e consisted of nhbr2 while the combined chlorine consisted mainly of the more stable monochloramine nh2cl fig 4d f therefore in the bromine ammonia system total residual bromine fig 4a was lower at 30 min compared to 5 min contact time due to the decomposition of nhbr2 these results confirmed the previous assumptions by lapointe et al 1975 and explained the differences between the breakpoint values at 30 min and 5 min fig 4a in the chlorine ammonia system the stability of nh2cl explained the similar residual chlorine concentrations obtained for 5 and 30 min contact times fig 4b for cl n 1 i e 5 0 mg cl2 mg n around the breakpoint value fig 4b total residual chlorine was lower at 30 min compared to 5 min contact time due to the formation and rapid decomposition of nhcl2 fig 4d f in the second part i e above the breakpoint the oxidant was present mainly as free bromine fig 4c e or chlorine fig 4d f nbr3 was present at higher concentration in the bromine ammonia system fig 4c e compared to ncl3 which was expected to be formed at very low concentrations at ph 8 fig 4d f fig 4 shows that the model predicted data for total bromine and speciation of bromamines were in good agreement with the experimental results the reactions and rate constants used in the model table 2 can accurately predict the bromine breakpoint curves and both kinetics and speciation of bromine species at ph 8 0 4 conclusions the bromine ammonia system was investigated in pure aqueous solution rate constants for the formation and decomposition of nhbr2 and nbr3 were determined and a comprehensive kinetic model was proposed that well predicted the formation and decomposition of bromamines at ph 8 0 8 3 for a wide range of initial concentrations and reaction times these results provide a better understanding of the chemistry of bromamines formed during oxidative treatments of bromide and ammonia containing waters the experimental results and model prediction indicated that significant amounts of nbr3 were present in mixture with free bromine above the breakpoint the presence of nbr3 could affect the effectiveness of disinfection but also the formation of disinfection byproducts due to the low reactivity of nbr3 with natural organic matter mensah et al 2022 this study provides a step further to the kinetic modelling of more complex systems such as seawater chlorination in the presence of ammonia however others oxidizing species such as bromochloramines i e nhbrcl nbr2cl and nbrcl2 need to be considered when waters containing ammonia and bromide are chlorinated mensah et al 2022 the model needs to be further improved by determining rate constants of formation and decomposition of these species this will help to better simulate oxidant residual and speciation during brackish seawater chlorination more research is also needed to evaluate the reactivity of nh2br and nhbr2 with natural organic matter in order to better understand their behaviour in natural waters and their

15502,the effluents of sewage treatment plants estp are one of the critical contributors of antibiotic resistiome in rivers recently community coalescence has been focused as the entire microbiome interchanges with one another while works have reported the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args in estp and their effects on river resistome little research has investigated the extent of resistome coalescence in the environment in the study we have addressed the issue and focused on the resistome coalescence of estp in an urban river with a typical effluent river coalescence model by utilizing high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic assembly analysis in all a total of 609 args were found in the estp river system conferring resistance to 30 antibiotic classes and including some emerging args such as mcr type tetx and carbapenemase genes statistical analyses including linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse showed the coalescence of stp effluents increased the diversity and abundance of river resistome indicating its low resistance to disturb the invasion of resistome community in estp after coalescence in the river the imprints of stp derived args presented a temporary increase and gradually decreased trend along the flow path further an innovative fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking feast method was used to quantitatively apportion the coalescence event and demonstrated the contribution of estp on river resistome and its attenuation dynamics in the downstream notably correlation based network analysis and contig based co occurrence analysis showed the coalesced resistome in the downstream river co occurred with human bacterial pathogens mobile genetic elements and virulence factor genes indicating potential resistome dissemination risk in the environment this study provides more profound understanding of resistome coalescence between engineered and natural contexts which is helpful for optimizing strategies to prevent and control resistome risk in aquatic environment keywords resistome coalescence antibiotic resistance genes attenuation dynamics metagenomic analysis fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past years the overexploitation and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine agricultural breeding and disease treatment have brought public health crisis due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args guo et al 2017 wu et al 2019 once acquiring args the human pathogenic bacteria cannot be killed efficiently by antibiotics with millions of people dying annually as a result zhang et al 2018 until now antibiotic resistance has been widely reported in various environments i e rivers and lakes as an emerging contaminant baral et al 2018 mazhar et al 2021 tang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 particularly the dissemination of args via horizontal gene transfer hgt among environmental microbes and human pathogens has been seriously concerned due to their non negligible health risks on public chen et al 2021 to prevent and control the resistome risk it is essential to better understand the sources of args and their spread dynamics in environments baral et al 2018 chen et al 2019a sewage treatment plants stps are one of the crucial anthropogenic sources of args to disseminate antibiotic resistance in environments guo et al 2017 osińska et al 2020 they receive wastewaters from various sources including hospital domestic pharmaceutical and agricultural activities and then discharge the effluents after treatment ezeuko et al 2021 however the effluents of stps estp usually contain a large amount of args and antibiotic resistance bacteria arb because conventional stps are ineffective in entirely removing the emerging contaminants lee et al 2017 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 a recent study by wang et al 2021 showed the absolute abundances of seven args in the secondary effluents from four stps were 103 104 copies ml with 0 19 2 91 log of arg being removed although some advanced technologies are proved to be more effective in combating args and arb there are still a large amount of args and arb residues in the effluents of stps wang et al 2021 chen et al 2022 indeed a number of investigations suggested abundant and diverse args were detected in the stp effluents worldwide cacace et al 2019 osińska et al 2020 wang et al 2021 a pan european survey by cacace et al 2019 found that several args i e sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 and bla ctx m 32 and inti1 were widely spread in the treated wastewater from 16 european urban stps rivers are the open and susceptible receptor of various wastes associated with human activities i e stp effluents allowing them to be a reservoir and spread channel of args and arb in environments guo et al 2017 chen et al 2022 many studies reported the prevalence of args in rivers all over the world chen et al 2019b wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 some of them also discussed the potential effect of stp effluents on args in river environment and showed the wastewater from stp elevated the abundance and diversity of args and arb in the receiving water even contributing their enrichments to the river sediments harnisz et al 2020 osińska et al 2020 pantanella et al 2020 reichert et al 2021 nevertheless most of the previous studies mainly investigated the occurrence abundance and distribution of args in the influent and or effluent of stps and the receiving water environments rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 harnisz et al 2020 pantanella et al 2020 and little research has investigated the extent of resistome coalescence in the environment indeed the flows of estp in rivers lead to the mixing of their resident resistome communities and surrounding environments namely resistome coalescence mansour et al 2018 gao et al 2021 the coalescence event occurs with the resistome in estp immigrating into the river environment certainly the resident community in river is locally adapted to the niches and resists the invasion of estp de meester et al 2016 nevertheless the coalesced estp contains nutrients and antibiotics that can promote the successful establishment of species and affect the success of various arbs in river following mixing amarasiri et al 2019 particularly the coalescence can result in the transfer of resistance genes in estp to native river organisms mansour et al 2018 therefore better understanding the resistome coalescence is important for preventing and controlling the environmental risk of arg related pollution in river system gao et al 2021 however the processes and factors that govern the resistome coalescence in the environment are still poorly understood in this study we addressed the issue and focused on the resistome coalescence of estp in an urban river in beijing with a typical effluent river coalescence model that the wastewater is added consistently and smoothly to river via wholesale mixing with unequal ratios by utilizing high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic assembly analysis compared to pcr qpcr methods metagenomic analysis provides global snapshots of resistome profiles in environmental samples chen et al 2019a to obtain more reliable results the annotations of resistome related genes and microbiome were conducted on the assembled contigs rather than the raw reads chen et al 2019b further to quantify the resistome coalescence and understand the fluctuation and stabilization of the resultant community a novel fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking feast tool was used for apportioning the relative contributions of estp in explaining the river resistome shenhav et al 2019 additionally the potential dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the river system was explored by identifying the co occurrence of resistome mobilome and virulome in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the chaobai river is a typical peri urban river and provides an important water source for jingjinji area in china and the stp is located on the east side of the river and adopts a2o mbr process with a processing capacity of 100 000 tons daily fig 1 the area has a temperate continental climate and the average annual precipitation is less than 500 mm in the study a total of 30 samples were collected within 2 consecutive days in october 2020 without recent rainfall among them 6 effluent samples e1 e6 were collected from the outfall of the stp and 24 water and sediment samples were collected from 12 sites along the river including four from the upstream of the stp outfall u1 u4 and eight from its downstream d1 d8 fig 1 for each water sample 5 l water was collected using a telescopic sampler and kept in the sterile plastic container the water quality parameters were tested in situ using a portable multi parameter sonde hach loveland co usa including temperature ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds at each sampling site of the river water u1 u4 d1 d8 the surficial sediment 10 cm was also collected with a stainless steel core sampler and stored in the sterile polypropylene centrifuge tube 10 ml after collection all samples were kept in a refrigerator 4 and immediately transported to laboratory within 12 h in laboratory water samples were filtered through 0 45 and 0 22 μm nitrocellulose filters in turn within 12 h the precipitated substances were frozen at 80 before dna extraction as well as the sediment samples 2 2 dna extraction shotgun sequencing and data pretreatment according to the instructions of manufacturer the total dna was extracted for each sample using the tianamp dna kit tiangen biotech china the quality and concentration of dna were checked by the gel electrophoresis 1 agarose and qubit dsdna detection kit in qubit2 0 flurometer life technologies usa then the high quality of dna was employed to construct libraries followed by the shotgun sequencing on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform at the novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd nanjing china with 150 bp paired end strategies after sequencing the raw reads were filtered using fastp v0 19 5 to remove the low quality reads chen et al 2019a details about the basic information of the metagenomic data set used in this study were summarized in table s1 2 3 metagenomic assembly binning and open reading frame prediction the quality filtered reads were de novo assembled to obtain scaftigs using megahit v1 1 2 li et al 2015 the scaftigs longer than 500 bp were used for binning to recover metagenome assembled genomes mags using metabat2 v2 12 1 dongwan et al 2015 the open reading frames orfs were predicted using metaprodigal v2 6 3 and the orfs longer than 100 nt were used for clustering to obtain non redundant orfs using cd hit v4 6 8 with 95 homology exceeding 90 of the shorter orf length li and godzik 2006 2 4 annotations of resistome and microbiome the predicted orfs were aligned against the hmd arg database http www cbrc kaust edu sa hmdarg to annotate args using diamond v2 0 9 buchfink et al 2015 with an e value cutoff of 1e 10 the orfs were identified as the arg like sequences if they have more than 60 similarity in the reference database and exceed 70 query coverage ma et al 2017 to facilitate comparison the coverage of the annotated orfs was normalized to the unit metagenomic data set with time per gigabyte gb and the coverage of the same arg type or subtype was calculated by summing the same type or subtype xiong et al 2018 for microbiome annotation the protein sequences of orfs were searched against the progenomes database https progenomes embl de using kaiju v1 6 3 menzel et al 2016 and the taxonomic assignment of mags was performed using gtdb tk v 0 3 3 with default options parks et al 2018 by comparing to a pathogen database we also identified the bacterial pathogens based on the kaiju results at the species level li et al 2016 2 5 quantification of resistome coalescence by source apportionment based on the profiles of args annotated we first identified the source specific fingerprints for the coalesced resistome communities and their potential sources by characterizing the specific indicator args in the corresponding sinks and sources using indicator species analysis isa li et al 2018 the isa employs the relative abundance and occurrence frequency of species or genes to estimate their relationship strengths with the priori groups and uses randomization test to evaluate the relationship probability severns and sykes 2020 a species or gene will be assigned to the one sink source group if it has the greatest indicator value on the type the indicator values range from 0 to 1 with higher values for stronger indicators further a novel community based microbial source tracking method feast was employed to quantify the resistome coalescence and understand the fluctuation and stabilization of the resultant community in the receiving river the feast assumes the sink is a convex combination of a group of potential sources and unknown sources and uses a multinomial distribution to quantify the fraction of each source and unknown source in the sink community shenhav et al 2019 in the study feast was used to quantitatively apportion the contribution of the stp effluents to the coalesced resistome at different distances from the outfall in the downstream river the potential sources included the stp effluents and the upstream water and the feast model was performed under default conditions with ten runs 2 6 identification of resistome dissemination risk martínez et al 2015 suggested the args presenting on mges hosted by human bacterial pathogens mean high resistome dissemination risk to annotate mges and virulence factor genes vfgs the predicted orfs were aligned against the mge database pärnänen et al 2018 and vfg database chen et al 2016 respectively being similar to the annotation of args the mge database includes more than 2700 non redundant sequences belonging to more than 270 different types including plasmid integrase transposase and insertion elements to characterize the co occurrence of args with mges and vfgs we identified three types of binned contigs that contained args arg mge and arg mge vfg according to the previous study chen et al 2019b as for comparison the coverages of the three binned contig types for each sample were projected into a three dimensional hazard space in which each dimension represented a resistome risk component the proximity of each sample pair was defined as the euclidean distance between two points in hazard space and the resistome risk score rrs was calculated for comparison between samples by inverting the euclidean distance between a given sample point s and the maximum boundary point h with the following equation oh et al 2018 1 r r s 1 2 l o g 10 d i s t s h 2 where d i s t s h represents the euclidean distance between s and h 2 7 statistical analysis principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to identify the difference of args between the stp and river based on bray curtis distance linear regression model was employed to figure out the correlation of args and water quality parameters linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to identify the args that have significant differences between the upstream and downstream samples and lda 2 was used to screen the highly differential args network analysis was conducted to explore the co occurrence of args with mges vfgs based on their strong correlation coefficients spearman s ρ 0 7 p 0 01 chen et al 2019b and network visualization was performed using gephi v0 9 2 the tests were considered to be significant at p 0 05 and the p value was adjusted using benjamini hochberg false discovery rate procedure all the statistical analyses were performed in r v3 6 1 if not specific with several packages such as pheatmap venndiagram circlize ggplot2 and psych 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of antibiotic resistome in the estp river system a total of 609 different args were detected in the estp river system belonging to 30 arg types as shown in fig 2 a among them most arg types were shared by all the samples while streptothricin and quaternary ammonium qa compound resistance genes were absent in the river the top 5 most abundant args in the river were multidrug macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls quinolone tetracycline and bacitracin resistance genes averagely accounting for more than 50 of the total arg coverage while in the stp effluents polymyxin replaced tetracycline resistance genes in dominance notably these abundant args corresponded to the antibiotics that are widely used in clinical treatment and husbandry sabri et al 2020 in this area the total emissions of the commonly used antibiotics were estimated up to be more than one hundred tonnes in 2013 zhang et al 2015 previously similar results were reported in various environments impacted by human activities including river water sediment and effluents from wastewater treatment plants guo et al 2017 chen et al 2019a 2022 in terms of resistome diversity the shannon indexes of args ranged from 1 04 to 2 87 for all samples and 248 core arg subtypes were shared by the estp river system fig s1a the genes encoding macb mls uppp bacitracin tufab tetracycline tett tetracycline and katg isoniazid were the top five most abundant arg subtypes with an average coverage of 4 5 gb for each subtype notably the mcr type genes i e mcr 1 mcr 4 and mcr 5 representing resistance against strong or last resort antibiotics were detected in the estp river system also some other emerging args were widely detected in the environment including an array of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae related genes i e ccra fez 1 ges type and oxa type and tetx a multiple mobile genetic elements mediated gene conferring resistance to tetracycline and tigecycline chen et al 2021 indeed previous studies also reported their occurrences in the stp effluents and the receiving waters dong et al 2017 reichert et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that these emerging args can make bacteria resistant to the last resort drugs and thus cause a potential health risk martínez et al 2015 obviously the coverage of args in the stp effluents was significantly higher than that in the receiving river p 0 01 fig 2b similar findings were also reported previously osińska et al 2020 pantanella et al 2020 reichert et al 2021 since the removals of emerging pollutants were difficult by traditional technologies in stps and thus the effluents still contained abundant arb and args tang et al 2021 relatively args in the river sediments were more diverse and abundant than those in the river water fig 2b being consistent with previous studies in yangtze estuary and three gorges reservoir gao et al 2021 not strangely the bulk of the microbial biomass in waters could attach to sediment surfaces and the adsorption of dnases by soil and clay components in sediment decreased the hydrolysis of free dna including args and allowed they to exist longer in sediment than in water luo et al 2010 further principal coordinate analysis pcoa demonstrated the differences of arg profiles between the stp effluents river waters and river sediments p 0 001 as shown in fig 2c samples are clustered and clearly divided according to ecological niches the richness of args at the subtype level also confirmed the differences fig s1 3 2 coalescence increased the diversity and abundance of riverine resistome differences in the profile of args between the estp and river inevitably result in variations in the coalesced resistome with not only args present upstream river being diluted or disturbed through direct input or host microorganism interactions but also new arg subtypes being introduced by the estp in the study we delineated 51 genes that might be derived from the estp since they were not detected in the upstream river and meanwhile identified in the downstream river fig 3 a among them 11 args i e smes blaoxa 2 and macb2 were detected in both the stp effluents and adjacent downstream site of the outfall but did not exist in the upstream river study previously showed the high concentration of blaoxa 2 in stp effluents meng et al 2020 likewise the gene of smes was reported to be unique in the effluent receiving river and lake bondarczuk and piotrowska seget 2019 overall the richness of args in the downstream was higher than that in the upstream water for example the richness of args increased 6 from the u4 to d1 indicating the coalescence of stp effluents increased the diversity of riverine resistome some of the stp derived args even existed in the distant downstream including smes and blaoxa 2 not strangely similar result was also reported previously that after being discharged from stp effluents into river some args like sul1 could exist until 20 km downstream and kept constant abundance sabri et al 2020 besides the newly introduced args the coverages for some args in the river significantly increased p 0 05 after receiving the emission of stp effluents as presented in fig 4 a the total args in the downstream site increased 17 when compared to the adjacent upstream site as well as several dominant arg types i e multidrug mls quinolone tetracycline and bacitracin particularly genes resistant to bacitracin and multidrug had the most remarkable rise with an increase of 33 6 and 29 0 respectively not strangely the abundances of multidrug and bacitracin resistance genes in the stp effluents were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the river fig s2 further the lefse analysis identified six i e emre mexi aac 1 and dfre and ten i e smes mexi sul2 and vanrc highly differential args in the downstream water and sediment respectively fig 3b 3c among them sul2 was frequently detected in stp effluents and related environments sabri et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and the gene of dfre was also widely reported as the dominant arg in stp effluents chicken manure and sediment chen et al 2019a the wide prevalence of these args in the stp effluents has increased significantly their abundances in the receiving environments as a whole our findings indicated that the coalescence event elevated significantly the diversity and abundance of args in the receiving river providing support for the hypothesis that the ecological coselection during community coalescence of stp effluents exerts effect on the riverine resistome in general the effluents of stp are considered as an important source and dissemination pathway of args in water environments osińska et al 2020 reichert et al 2021 sabri et al 2020 for instance osińska et al 2020 showed stp effluents were the sources of args in the aquatic environment containing abundant tetracycline and β lactam resistance genes however the resident community in the river will resist the invasion of resistome community in estp since resident species in the river are locally adapted to the present niches owing to ecological selection and evolution castledine et al 2020 on the other hand the invading estp community arrives with nutrients which can promote the successful establishment of its species and disturb the home advantage of river community furthermore the resistome coalescence can also result in the transfer of args in estp to native river microorganisms mansour et al 2018 overall results in the study suggested low resistance of river resident community to disturb the coalescence of estp resistome community 3 3 multiple factors influenced the coalescence of resistome and its attenuation dynamics in the river as discussed above some args in the downstream river were introduced and or increased by the coalescence of stp effluents notably some of them were not found in the distant downstream likely due to their attenuations and or dilutions in the river thus we further analyzed the variation of args along the flow path to investigate the spread dynamics of stp derived args in the river as shown in fig 4 although the stp effluents elevated the level of args in the adjacent site nearby the outfall of stp effluents the args presented a decreased trend along the flow path due to the limited discharge flux of stps the coalescence was asymmetrical since the volume of estp was much less than the river water the proportion of stp effluents to river discharge affects the mixing ratio of resistome communities and thus influences the coalescence outcome rillig et al 2015 in the study the emission of stp effluents 1 104 m3 d was too small compared with the river flux 1 68 106 1 18 107 m3 d and thus the significant dilution effect was to be predominantly responsible for the decrease of args after the emission actually similar results were also reported in the previous study that the dilution of the stp effluents into the river flow accounted for a significant decrease in the abundance of args pantanella et al 2020 a recent investigation suggested that a percentage higher than 10 of wastewater effluents could account for significant shifts in bacterial community while no significant shifts were observed when the percentage of stp effluents was lower than 1 ruprecht et al 2021 besides the dilution the coalesced resistome in river would be attenuated along the water flow path the reduction of args may be due to the direct decay of args from bacterial cells or the decrease of microorganisms the host of args liu et al 2019 previously similar findings were reported on the limited dynamics of eight prevalent args from stp effluents in the receiving rivers wang et al 2021 the degradation dynamics of resistome in river are complex and influenced by many factors such as sunlight predator and environmental matrix properties ahmed et al 2019 studies suggested sunlight mediated photo inactivation of bacteria was a main decay pathway of args in river via the direct damage induced by uv irradiation and the indirect damage induced by the photo produced reactive intermediates generated in the organisms nelson et al 2018 zeep et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 showed the sunlight mediated inactivation could influence the prevalence of args in environments by acting on both arb inactivation and arg degradation nelson et al 2018 although sunlight does not selectively decrease args uv irradiation can eliminate the ability of various args to transform competent non resistant recipient bacteria to the corresponding resistance phenotypes nelson et al 2018 and the conjugative transfer frequency of arb has been proved to be affected by simulated sunlight irradiation chen et al 2019c regarding the biotic interactions the asymmetrical coalescence is in favor of the resident resistome in river versus immigrating community in estp thus some invading arb will be failed subsequently if they are susceptible to predators parasites affecting the resident species in river on the other hand water activity and environmental condition would also influence the decay and growth of microorganisms ahmed et al 2019 always the condition in river presents a higher amount of abiotic filtering therefore we further explored the correlation between the args and water quality parameters to test their effects on the coalesced resistome including temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec in the river these parameters were speculated to be associated with the dynamic of microbes in river nõlvak et al 2013 as presented in fig s3 ec in the water samples ranged from 808 to 893 μs cm with a strong negative correlation p 0 01 with the total args the influence of ph on args was reported in previous investigations where ph was positively correlated with sul1 in the fertilized agricultural soil and negatively correlated with sul2 in seawater nõlvak et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however no correlation of args with temperature r2 0 05 and ph r2 0 22 was found in this study fig s3 for do it presented similar law with ec p 0 01 notably do is a critical parameter for the prevalence of args since it reflects the self purification capability of water also previous studies reported the strongly negative correlation of do with multiple args including sul2 bla tem and 4 tetracycline resistance genes harnisz et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 3 4 source apportionment quantified the resistome coalescence to quantitatively characterize the resistome coalescence in downstream river we applied feast for apportioning the contribution of stp effluents and identifying the variation trend at different distances from the outfall the source specific fingerprints of args extracted by indicator species analysis isa were employed for quantifying the sources of resistome in the river water using feast as presented in fig 5 a and the model results of feast were shown in fig 5b herein 225 args were chosen as fingerprint indicators based on the result of isa p 0 05 and they comprised up to 67 89 of total args in each sample expectedly the distribution of the fingerprint indicators clearly showed higher abundance in the indicated source type whereas lower in other types as shown in fig 5a most of the arg indicators were specialists with high abundances in their indicated types but rare in others and a few indicators appeared to be generalists with both high abundance and detection rate outside their indicator types as a whole the specialist and generalist fingerprint indicators acted as representative args in their indicated source types providing potential and utility in resolving the source specific fingerprints of args to ensure the use of feast model for distinguishing the source sink relationship of args in the environment baral et al 2018 chen et al 2019a li et al 2018 as shown in fig 5b upstream water was apportioned as the dominant contributor of args in the downstream with an average contribution of 88 while the contribution of stp effluents was about 10 15 in general resistome coalescence is based on the host microorganism s coalescence and or gene transfer as mentioned above the coalescence was an asymmetrical outcome since the volume of estp was much less than the flux of river water thus the resistome coalescence of estp did not result in substantial alteration because the mixing ratio was skewed towards the river resistome rillig et al 2015 on the other hand the rapid mixing and short coalescence duration in the practical conditions make the horizontal transfer of args cross taxa negligible liu et al 2017 furthermore the high degree of community cohesion and abiotic filtering in the river system caused the initial resistome community to dominate the mixture in the downstream xu et al 2022 as shown in fig s3 the physicochemical properties of river water were identified as a potential factor to profile the args in the environment the distinction between the stp effluents and upstream river disturbed the physicochemical properties during the resistome coalescence but the quality of downstream river was generally closer to the upstream river which makes it possible that some microorganisms from the stp effluents could not adapt to the coalesced environment and therefore their growths might be inhibited or they might not survive mallon et al 2018 the priority effect of the resident community in river made the imported microorganisms with same function in the coalesced communities at a disadvantage in the competition resulting in the upstream river occupying the dominant position castledine et al 2020 mawarda et al 2022 obviously the contribution of stp effluents decreased with the increasing distances from the sampling point to the outfall particularly between the adjacent downstream sites i e d1 and d2 as shown in fig 5b indicating dilution attenuation effect of river water on the coalescence of stp effluents it was possible that the resistome community from effluents was more susceptible to attenuate relative to the one in the upstream river that leaded to a reduction in the contribution of stp effluents strickler et al 2015 for example microorganisms originally existed in the river have been filtrated by sunlight whereas the microorganisms and args in the effluents mostly come from the stp reservoir or pipeline network and may exist in the dark conditions during the transportation and discharge making their responses to sunlight irradiation more drastic and resulting in stronger attenuation in the coalesced river schultz fademrecht et al 2008 however some of these features may not exist in the stable coalesced river notably although our analyses quantified the resistome coalescence with the field based experiment the processes and factors that govern the coalescence event and its attenuation dynamics in the environment are very complex rillig et al 2015 to determinate deeply the fraction of driving forces i e mixing ratio flow velocity tributary inflow biotic interactions and abiotic filtering on the resistome coalescence more investigations should be considered in future via microcosm based controlled experiments 3 5 dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the river system the args presenting on mges in hbps had high dissemination risk martínez et al 2015 in the estp river system a total of 49 bacterial phyla were found and the dominators were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria verrucomicrobia and cyanobacteria fig s4 among them proteobacteria an indicator of human activities and urban pollution torres et al 2019 was the most abundant phylum especially in the stp effluents at the species level 4565 species were identified and most of the top 50 were assigned to proteobacteria fig s5 notably by comparing to the pathogen database 345 potential hbps were identified fig 6 a mainly belonging to proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes particularly several epidemic pathogens like kingella kingae yersinia enterocolitica and helicobacter pylori were also found in the estp river system among them the kingella kingae has high resistance to various common antibacterial drugs especially to penicillin and the helicobacter pylori can cause various stomach problems and even stomach cancer and more than half of people in the world have been infected with helicobacter pylori hooi et al 2017 the prevalence of these pathogenic bacteria in the estp river system posed a non negligible risk to public health when they are resistant to antibiotics as shown in fig 6b the co occurrence network of args with hbps showed multiple hbps took along multiple args in the environment they may be the potential arg hosts and play key role in the dissemination of args in environments forsberg et al 2014 ma et al 2017 regarding the mobility of resistome herein 72 mges were identified in the estp river system including integrases plasmids and transposases among them the most abundant mges were tnpa transposase is91 insert sequence and inti1 integrase accounting for 65 3 78 4 of the total mges for each sample fig s6 notably tnpa was also reported previously to be the main mge to influence the propagation of args in environments mazhar et al 2021 wang et al 2020b for inti1 an indicator marker of human activity it has been frequently detected in rivers with high abundance reflecting the influence of human activity on the prevalence of resistome in the environment zhang et al 2021 furthermore the co occurrence network of mges with args suggested the most well connected mges were iscr8 tnpa1 tnpa isbf10 and inti1 which presented strong correlations with more than 20 args fig s7 these mges have potentials to transfer multiple args facilitating the dissemination of args between different bacterial hosts likewise a recent study showed that mges had conceivable influence on arg shifts in water environment and the transfer likelihood of args from arb to human pathogens was proportional to the mges proportion zhang et al 2021 notably args were found to co exist with plasmid and insert sequence on some contigs such as incq1 sul2 is91 the prevalent of arg carrying plasmids in the environment plays important roles in acquisition and mobility of args among bacterial community importantly the args well connected with multiple mges were also closely connected with many hbps as discussed above fig 6b these args would have a high resistome dissemination risk since the args hosted by hbps could disseminate between different bacterial pathogens via hgt promoted by mges where they reside martínez et al 2015 further we conducted the contigs based analysis to explore the co occurrence of args with mges and virulence factor genes vfgs to identify the resistome dissemination risk the vfgs can aid pathogens in invading the hosts and escape the defense mechanisms of hosts causing infection and diseases durso et al 2011 importantly vfgs can be encoded on mges i e plasmids and phages and spread via horizontal gene transfer empowering harmless bacteria become pathogenic in the study 27 vfgs were found in the estp river system fig s8 among them offensive vfgs were the most diverse and abundant type accounting for about 40 of the total vfgs as reported previously opportunistic pathogen with more offensive vfgs was more virulent wang et al 2019 once the opportunistic pathogen carrying abundant offensive vfgs are prevalent in water environment and transmit to human public health will be threatened and when args and vfgs coexist with mges the health risk will further increase liang et al 2020 to demonstrate their co occurrences in the environment we identified three types of binned contigs that contain args arg mge and arg mge vfg like sequences and calculated the resistome risk score rrs for each sample as shown in fig 6c relatively the river sediments showed higher resistome risk than river waters indicating the accumulation of args mges and vfgs in the sediments due to community coalescence and horizontal gene transfer the migration rate of microbial community in sediment was much lower than that in river water liu et al 2018 thus attachment to sediments might increase chances of long term persistence of stp derived args in the environment as a whole the contig based co occurrence analysis confirmed the potential environmental risk of coalesced resistome in the river system since the bacteria co carrying vfgs mges and args will be pathogenic and empower pathogen be resistant to target antibiotics tang et al 2021 liang et al 2020 nevertheless it should be noted that the resistome risk need to be further validated using culture based method and or function metagenomic approach 4 conclusion in this research we investigated systematically the resistome coalescence of stp effluents in an urban river apportioned quantitatively the coalescence event using a community based microbial source tracking tool and identified the dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the environment results showed that the coalescence of stp effluents in river increased the diversity and abundance of riverine resistome while the processes and factors that governed the coalescence event of resistome and its attenuation dynamics were complex mixing ratio sunlight priority effect and environmental conditions would dominate the fluctuation and stabilization of the coalesced resistome community which was particularly evident for the args imported by the stp effluents making the contribution of effluents in the coalesced resistome decreasing with distance additionally our analyses showed potential dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the river system and emphasized the role of river as a channel of resistance risk transmission

15502,the effluents of sewage treatment plants estp are one of the critical contributors of antibiotic resistiome in rivers recently community coalescence has been focused as the entire microbiome interchanges with one another while works have reported the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args in estp and their effects on river resistome little research has investigated the extent of resistome coalescence in the environment in the study we have addressed the issue and focused on the resistome coalescence of estp in an urban river with a typical effluent river coalescence model by utilizing high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic assembly analysis in all a total of 609 args were found in the estp river system conferring resistance to 30 antibiotic classes and including some emerging args such as mcr type tetx and carbapenemase genes statistical analyses including linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse showed the coalescence of stp effluents increased the diversity and abundance of river resistome indicating its low resistance to disturb the invasion of resistome community in estp after coalescence in the river the imprints of stp derived args presented a temporary increase and gradually decreased trend along the flow path further an innovative fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking feast method was used to quantitatively apportion the coalescence event and demonstrated the contribution of estp on river resistome and its attenuation dynamics in the downstream notably correlation based network analysis and contig based co occurrence analysis showed the coalesced resistome in the downstream river co occurred with human bacterial pathogens mobile genetic elements and virulence factor genes indicating potential resistome dissemination risk in the environment this study provides more profound understanding of resistome coalescence between engineered and natural contexts which is helpful for optimizing strategies to prevent and control resistome risk in aquatic environment keywords resistome coalescence antibiotic resistance genes attenuation dynamics metagenomic analysis fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past years the overexploitation and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine agricultural breeding and disease treatment have brought public health crisis due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args guo et al 2017 wu et al 2019 once acquiring args the human pathogenic bacteria cannot be killed efficiently by antibiotics with millions of people dying annually as a result zhang et al 2018 until now antibiotic resistance has been widely reported in various environments i e rivers and lakes as an emerging contaminant baral et al 2018 mazhar et al 2021 tang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 particularly the dissemination of args via horizontal gene transfer hgt among environmental microbes and human pathogens has been seriously concerned due to their non negligible health risks on public chen et al 2021 to prevent and control the resistome risk it is essential to better understand the sources of args and their spread dynamics in environments baral et al 2018 chen et al 2019a sewage treatment plants stps are one of the crucial anthropogenic sources of args to disseminate antibiotic resistance in environments guo et al 2017 osińska et al 2020 they receive wastewaters from various sources including hospital domestic pharmaceutical and agricultural activities and then discharge the effluents after treatment ezeuko et al 2021 however the effluents of stps estp usually contain a large amount of args and antibiotic resistance bacteria arb because conventional stps are ineffective in entirely removing the emerging contaminants lee et al 2017 narcisoda rocha et al 2018 a recent study by wang et al 2021 showed the absolute abundances of seven args in the secondary effluents from four stps were 103 104 copies ml with 0 19 2 91 log of arg being removed although some advanced technologies are proved to be more effective in combating args and arb there are still a large amount of args and arb residues in the effluents of stps wang et al 2021 chen et al 2022 indeed a number of investigations suggested abundant and diverse args were detected in the stp effluents worldwide cacace et al 2019 osińska et al 2020 wang et al 2021 a pan european survey by cacace et al 2019 found that several args i e sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 and bla ctx m 32 and inti1 were widely spread in the treated wastewater from 16 european urban stps rivers are the open and susceptible receptor of various wastes associated with human activities i e stp effluents allowing them to be a reservoir and spread channel of args and arb in environments guo et al 2017 chen et al 2022 many studies reported the prevalence of args in rivers all over the world chen et al 2019b wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 some of them also discussed the potential effect of stp effluents on args in river environment and showed the wastewater from stp elevated the abundance and diversity of args and arb in the receiving water even contributing their enrichments to the river sediments harnisz et al 2020 osińska et al 2020 pantanella et al 2020 reichert et al 2021 nevertheless most of the previous studies mainly investigated the occurrence abundance and distribution of args in the influent and or effluent of stps and the receiving water environments rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 harnisz et al 2020 pantanella et al 2020 and little research has investigated the extent of resistome coalescence in the environment indeed the flows of estp in rivers lead to the mixing of their resident resistome communities and surrounding environments namely resistome coalescence mansour et al 2018 gao et al 2021 the coalescence event occurs with the resistome in estp immigrating into the river environment certainly the resident community in river is locally adapted to the niches and resists the invasion of estp de meester et al 2016 nevertheless the coalesced estp contains nutrients and antibiotics that can promote the successful establishment of species and affect the success of various arbs in river following mixing amarasiri et al 2019 particularly the coalescence can result in the transfer of resistance genes in estp to native river organisms mansour et al 2018 therefore better understanding the resistome coalescence is important for preventing and controlling the environmental risk of arg related pollution in river system gao et al 2021 however the processes and factors that govern the resistome coalescence in the environment are still poorly understood in this study we addressed the issue and focused on the resistome coalescence of estp in an urban river in beijing with a typical effluent river coalescence model that the wastewater is added consistently and smoothly to river via wholesale mixing with unequal ratios by utilizing high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic assembly analysis compared to pcr qpcr methods metagenomic analysis provides global snapshots of resistome profiles in environmental samples chen et al 2019a to obtain more reliable results the annotations of resistome related genes and microbiome were conducted on the assembled contigs rather than the raw reads chen et al 2019b further to quantify the resistome coalescence and understand the fluctuation and stabilization of the resultant community a novel fast expectation maximization microbial source tracking feast tool was used for apportioning the relative contributions of estp in explaining the river resistome shenhav et al 2019 additionally the potential dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the river system was explored by identifying the co occurrence of resistome mobilome and virulome in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the chaobai river is a typical peri urban river and provides an important water source for jingjinji area in china and the stp is located on the east side of the river and adopts a2o mbr process with a processing capacity of 100 000 tons daily fig 1 the area has a temperate continental climate and the average annual precipitation is less than 500 mm in the study a total of 30 samples were collected within 2 consecutive days in october 2020 without recent rainfall among them 6 effluent samples e1 e6 were collected from the outfall of the stp and 24 water and sediment samples were collected from 12 sites along the river including four from the upstream of the stp outfall u1 u4 and eight from its downstream d1 d8 fig 1 for each water sample 5 l water was collected using a telescopic sampler and kept in the sterile plastic container the water quality parameters were tested in situ using a portable multi parameter sonde hach loveland co usa including temperature ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds at each sampling site of the river water u1 u4 d1 d8 the surficial sediment 10 cm was also collected with a stainless steel core sampler and stored in the sterile polypropylene centrifuge tube 10 ml after collection all samples were kept in a refrigerator 4 and immediately transported to laboratory within 12 h in laboratory water samples were filtered through 0 45 and 0 22 μm nitrocellulose filters in turn within 12 h the precipitated substances were frozen at 80 before dna extraction as well as the sediment samples 2 2 dna extraction shotgun sequencing and data pretreatment according to the instructions of manufacturer the total dna was extracted for each sample using the tianamp dna kit tiangen biotech china the quality and concentration of dna were checked by the gel electrophoresis 1 agarose and qubit dsdna detection kit in qubit2 0 flurometer life technologies usa then the high quality of dna was employed to construct libraries followed by the shotgun sequencing on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform at the novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd nanjing china with 150 bp paired end strategies after sequencing the raw reads were filtered using fastp v0 19 5 to remove the low quality reads chen et al 2019a details about the basic information of the metagenomic data set used in this study were summarized in table s1 2 3 metagenomic assembly binning and open reading frame prediction the quality filtered reads were de novo assembled to obtain scaftigs using megahit v1 1 2 li et al 2015 the scaftigs longer than 500 bp were used for binning to recover metagenome assembled genomes mags using metabat2 v2 12 1 dongwan et al 2015 the open reading frames orfs were predicted using metaprodigal v2 6 3 and the orfs longer than 100 nt were used for clustering to obtain non redundant orfs using cd hit v4 6 8 with 95 homology exceeding 90 of the shorter orf length li and godzik 2006 2 4 annotations of resistome and microbiome the predicted orfs were aligned against the hmd arg database http www cbrc kaust edu sa hmdarg to annotate args using diamond v2 0 9 buchfink et al 2015 with an e value cutoff of 1e 10 the orfs were identified as the arg like sequences if they have more than 60 similarity in the reference database and exceed 70 query coverage ma et al 2017 to facilitate comparison the coverage of the annotated orfs was normalized to the unit metagenomic data set with time per gigabyte gb and the coverage of the same arg type or subtype was calculated by summing the same type or subtype xiong et al 2018 for microbiome annotation the protein sequences of orfs were searched against the progenomes database https progenomes embl de using kaiju v1 6 3 menzel et al 2016 and the taxonomic assignment of mags was performed using gtdb tk v 0 3 3 with default options parks et al 2018 by comparing to a pathogen database we also identified the bacterial pathogens based on the kaiju results at the species level li et al 2016 2 5 quantification of resistome coalescence by source apportionment based on the profiles of args annotated we first identified the source specific fingerprints for the coalesced resistome communities and their potential sources by characterizing the specific indicator args in the corresponding sinks and sources using indicator species analysis isa li et al 2018 the isa employs the relative abundance and occurrence frequency of species or genes to estimate their relationship strengths with the priori groups and uses randomization test to evaluate the relationship probability severns and sykes 2020 a species or gene will be assigned to the one sink source group if it has the greatest indicator value on the type the indicator values range from 0 to 1 with higher values for stronger indicators further a novel community based microbial source tracking method feast was employed to quantify the resistome coalescence and understand the fluctuation and stabilization of the resultant community in the receiving river the feast assumes the sink is a convex combination of a group of potential sources and unknown sources and uses a multinomial distribution to quantify the fraction of each source and unknown source in the sink community shenhav et al 2019 in the study feast was used to quantitatively apportion the contribution of the stp effluents to the coalesced resistome at different distances from the outfall in the downstream river the potential sources included the stp effluents and the upstream water and the feast model was performed under default conditions with ten runs 2 6 identification of resistome dissemination risk martínez et al 2015 suggested the args presenting on mges hosted by human bacterial pathogens mean high resistome dissemination risk to annotate mges and virulence factor genes vfgs the predicted orfs were aligned against the mge database pärnänen et al 2018 and vfg database chen et al 2016 respectively being similar to the annotation of args the mge database includes more than 2700 non redundant sequences belonging to more than 270 different types including plasmid integrase transposase and insertion elements to characterize the co occurrence of args with mges and vfgs we identified three types of binned contigs that contained args arg mge and arg mge vfg according to the previous study chen et al 2019b as for comparison the coverages of the three binned contig types for each sample were projected into a three dimensional hazard space in which each dimension represented a resistome risk component the proximity of each sample pair was defined as the euclidean distance between two points in hazard space and the resistome risk score rrs was calculated for comparison between samples by inverting the euclidean distance between a given sample point s and the maximum boundary point h with the following equation oh et al 2018 1 r r s 1 2 l o g 10 d i s t s h 2 where d i s t s h represents the euclidean distance between s and h 2 7 statistical analysis principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to identify the difference of args between the stp and river based on bray curtis distance linear regression model was employed to figure out the correlation of args and water quality parameters linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to identify the args that have significant differences between the upstream and downstream samples and lda 2 was used to screen the highly differential args network analysis was conducted to explore the co occurrence of args with mges vfgs based on their strong correlation coefficients spearman s ρ 0 7 p 0 01 chen et al 2019b and network visualization was performed using gephi v0 9 2 the tests were considered to be significant at p 0 05 and the p value was adjusted using benjamini hochberg false discovery rate procedure all the statistical analyses were performed in r v3 6 1 if not specific with several packages such as pheatmap venndiagram circlize ggplot2 and psych 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of antibiotic resistome in the estp river system a total of 609 different args were detected in the estp river system belonging to 30 arg types as shown in fig 2 a among them most arg types were shared by all the samples while streptothricin and quaternary ammonium qa compound resistance genes were absent in the river the top 5 most abundant args in the river were multidrug macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls quinolone tetracycline and bacitracin resistance genes averagely accounting for more than 50 of the total arg coverage while in the stp effluents polymyxin replaced tetracycline resistance genes in dominance notably these abundant args corresponded to the antibiotics that are widely used in clinical treatment and husbandry sabri et al 2020 in this area the total emissions of the commonly used antibiotics were estimated up to be more than one hundred tonnes in 2013 zhang et al 2015 previously similar results were reported in various environments impacted by human activities including river water sediment and effluents from wastewater treatment plants guo et al 2017 chen et al 2019a 2022 in terms of resistome diversity the shannon indexes of args ranged from 1 04 to 2 87 for all samples and 248 core arg subtypes were shared by the estp river system fig s1a the genes encoding macb mls uppp bacitracin tufab tetracycline tett tetracycline and katg isoniazid were the top five most abundant arg subtypes with an average coverage of 4 5 gb for each subtype notably the mcr type genes i e mcr 1 mcr 4 and mcr 5 representing resistance against strong or last resort antibiotics were detected in the estp river system also some other emerging args were widely detected in the environment including an array of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae related genes i e ccra fez 1 ges type and oxa type and tetx a multiple mobile genetic elements mediated gene conferring resistance to tetracycline and tigecycline chen et al 2021 indeed previous studies also reported their occurrences in the stp effluents and the receiving waters dong et al 2017 reichert et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that these emerging args can make bacteria resistant to the last resort drugs and thus cause a potential health risk martínez et al 2015 obviously the coverage of args in the stp effluents was significantly higher than that in the receiving river p 0 01 fig 2b similar findings were also reported previously osińska et al 2020 pantanella et al 2020 reichert et al 2021 since the removals of emerging pollutants were difficult by traditional technologies in stps and thus the effluents still contained abundant arb and args tang et al 2021 relatively args in the river sediments were more diverse and abundant than those in the river water fig 2b being consistent with previous studies in yangtze estuary and three gorges reservoir gao et al 2021 not strangely the bulk of the microbial biomass in waters could attach to sediment surfaces and the adsorption of dnases by soil and clay components in sediment decreased the hydrolysis of free dna including args and allowed they to exist longer in sediment than in water luo et al 2010 further principal coordinate analysis pcoa demonstrated the differences of arg profiles between the stp effluents river waters and river sediments p 0 001 as shown in fig 2c samples are clustered and clearly divided according to ecological niches the richness of args at the subtype level also confirmed the differences fig s1 3 2 coalescence increased the diversity and abundance of riverine resistome differences in the profile of args between the estp and river inevitably result in variations in the coalesced resistome with not only args present upstream river being diluted or disturbed through direct input or host microorganism interactions but also new arg subtypes being introduced by the estp in the study we delineated 51 genes that might be derived from the estp since they were not detected in the upstream river and meanwhile identified in the downstream river fig 3 a among them 11 args i e smes blaoxa 2 and macb2 were detected in both the stp effluents and adjacent downstream site of the outfall but did not exist in the upstream river study previously showed the high concentration of blaoxa 2 in stp effluents meng et al 2020 likewise the gene of smes was reported to be unique in the effluent receiving river and lake bondarczuk and piotrowska seget 2019 overall the richness of args in the downstream was higher than that in the upstream water for example the richness of args increased 6 from the u4 to d1 indicating the coalescence of stp effluents increased the diversity of riverine resistome some of the stp derived args even existed in the distant downstream including smes and blaoxa 2 not strangely similar result was also reported previously that after being discharged from stp effluents into river some args like sul1 could exist until 20 km downstream and kept constant abundance sabri et al 2020 besides the newly introduced args the coverages for some args in the river significantly increased p 0 05 after receiving the emission of stp effluents as presented in fig 4 a the total args in the downstream site increased 17 when compared to the adjacent upstream site as well as several dominant arg types i e multidrug mls quinolone tetracycline and bacitracin particularly genes resistant to bacitracin and multidrug had the most remarkable rise with an increase of 33 6 and 29 0 respectively not strangely the abundances of multidrug and bacitracin resistance genes in the stp effluents were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the river fig s2 further the lefse analysis identified six i e emre mexi aac 1 and dfre and ten i e smes mexi sul2 and vanrc highly differential args in the downstream water and sediment respectively fig 3b 3c among them sul2 was frequently detected in stp effluents and related environments sabri et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and the gene of dfre was also widely reported as the dominant arg in stp effluents chicken manure and sediment chen et al 2019a the wide prevalence of these args in the stp effluents has increased significantly their abundances in the receiving environments as a whole our findings indicated that the coalescence event elevated significantly the diversity and abundance of args in the receiving river providing support for the hypothesis that the ecological coselection during community coalescence of stp effluents exerts effect on the riverine resistome in general the effluents of stp are considered as an important source and dissemination pathway of args in water environments osińska et al 2020 reichert et al 2021 sabri et al 2020 for instance osińska et al 2020 showed stp effluents were the sources of args in the aquatic environment containing abundant tetracycline and β lactam resistance genes however the resident community in the river will resist the invasion of resistome community in estp since resident species in the river are locally adapted to the present niches owing to ecological selection and evolution castledine et al 2020 on the other hand the invading estp community arrives with nutrients which can promote the successful establishment of its species and disturb the home advantage of river community furthermore the resistome coalescence can also result in the transfer of args in estp to native river microorganisms mansour et al 2018 overall results in the study suggested low resistance of river resident community to disturb the coalescence of estp resistome community 3 3 multiple factors influenced the coalescence of resistome and its attenuation dynamics in the river as discussed above some args in the downstream river were introduced and or increased by the coalescence of stp effluents notably some of them were not found in the distant downstream likely due to their attenuations and or dilutions in the river thus we further analyzed the variation of args along the flow path to investigate the spread dynamics of stp derived args in the river as shown in fig 4 although the stp effluents elevated the level of args in the adjacent site nearby the outfall of stp effluents the args presented a decreased trend along the flow path due to the limited discharge flux of stps the coalescence was asymmetrical since the volume of estp was much less than the river water the proportion of stp effluents to river discharge affects the mixing ratio of resistome communities and thus influences the coalescence outcome rillig et al 2015 in the study the emission of stp effluents 1 104 m3 d was too small compared with the river flux 1 68 106 1 18 107 m3 d and thus the significant dilution effect was to be predominantly responsible for the decrease of args after the emission actually similar results were also reported in the previous study that the dilution of the stp effluents into the river flow accounted for a significant decrease in the abundance of args pantanella et al 2020 a recent investigation suggested that a percentage higher than 10 of wastewater effluents could account for significant shifts in bacterial community while no significant shifts were observed when the percentage of stp effluents was lower than 1 ruprecht et al 2021 besides the dilution the coalesced resistome in river would be attenuated along the water flow path the reduction of args may be due to the direct decay of args from bacterial cells or the decrease of microorganisms the host of args liu et al 2019 previously similar findings were reported on the limited dynamics of eight prevalent args from stp effluents in the receiving rivers wang et al 2021 the degradation dynamics of resistome in river are complex and influenced by many factors such as sunlight predator and environmental matrix properties ahmed et al 2019 studies suggested sunlight mediated photo inactivation of bacteria was a main decay pathway of args in river via the direct damage induced by uv irradiation and the indirect damage induced by the photo produced reactive intermediates generated in the organisms nelson et al 2018 zeep et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 showed the sunlight mediated inactivation could influence the prevalence of args in environments by acting on both arb inactivation and arg degradation nelson et al 2018 although sunlight does not selectively decrease args uv irradiation can eliminate the ability of various args to transform competent non resistant recipient bacteria to the corresponding resistance phenotypes nelson et al 2018 and the conjugative transfer frequency of arb has been proved to be affected by simulated sunlight irradiation chen et al 2019c regarding the biotic interactions the asymmetrical coalescence is in favor of the resident resistome in river versus immigrating community in estp thus some invading arb will be failed subsequently if they are susceptible to predators parasites affecting the resident species in river on the other hand water activity and environmental condition would also influence the decay and growth of microorganisms ahmed et al 2019 always the condition in river presents a higher amount of abiotic filtering therefore we further explored the correlation between the args and water quality parameters to test their effects on the coalesced resistome including temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec in the river these parameters were speculated to be associated with the dynamic of microbes in river nõlvak et al 2013 as presented in fig s3 ec in the water samples ranged from 808 to 893 μs cm with a strong negative correlation p 0 01 with the total args the influence of ph on args was reported in previous investigations where ph was positively correlated with sul1 in the fertilized agricultural soil and negatively correlated with sul2 in seawater nõlvak et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however no correlation of args with temperature r2 0 05 and ph r2 0 22 was found in this study fig s3 for do it presented similar law with ec p 0 01 notably do is a critical parameter for the prevalence of args since it reflects the self purification capability of water also previous studies reported the strongly negative correlation of do with multiple args including sul2 bla tem and 4 tetracycline resistance genes harnisz et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 3 4 source apportionment quantified the resistome coalescence to quantitatively characterize the resistome coalescence in downstream river we applied feast for apportioning the contribution of stp effluents and identifying the variation trend at different distances from the outfall the source specific fingerprints of args extracted by indicator species analysis isa were employed for quantifying the sources of resistome in the river water using feast as presented in fig 5 a and the model results of feast were shown in fig 5b herein 225 args were chosen as fingerprint indicators based on the result of isa p 0 05 and they comprised up to 67 89 of total args in each sample expectedly the distribution of the fingerprint indicators clearly showed higher abundance in the indicated source type whereas lower in other types as shown in fig 5a most of the arg indicators were specialists with high abundances in their indicated types but rare in others and a few indicators appeared to be generalists with both high abundance and detection rate outside their indicator types as a whole the specialist and generalist fingerprint indicators acted as representative args in their indicated source types providing potential and utility in resolving the source specific fingerprints of args to ensure the use of feast model for distinguishing the source sink relationship of args in the environment baral et al 2018 chen et al 2019a li et al 2018 as shown in fig 5b upstream water was apportioned as the dominant contributor of args in the downstream with an average contribution of 88 while the contribution of stp effluents was about 10 15 in general resistome coalescence is based on the host microorganism s coalescence and or gene transfer as mentioned above the coalescence was an asymmetrical outcome since the volume of estp was much less than the flux of river water thus the resistome coalescence of estp did not result in substantial alteration because the mixing ratio was skewed towards the river resistome rillig et al 2015 on the other hand the rapid mixing and short coalescence duration in the practical conditions make the horizontal transfer of args cross taxa negligible liu et al 2017 furthermore the high degree of community cohesion and abiotic filtering in the river system caused the initial resistome community to dominate the mixture in the downstream xu et al 2022 as shown in fig s3 the physicochemical properties of river water were identified as a potential factor to profile the args in the environment the distinction between the stp effluents and upstream river disturbed the physicochemical properties during the resistome coalescence but the quality of downstream river was generally closer to the upstream river which makes it possible that some microorganisms from the stp effluents could not adapt to the coalesced environment and therefore their growths might be inhibited or they might not survive mallon et al 2018 the priority effect of the resident community in river made the imported microorganisms with same function in the coalesced communities at a disadvantage in the competition resulting in the upstream river occupying the dominant position castledine et al 2020 mawarda et al 2022 obviously the contribution of stp effluents decreased with the increasing distances from the sampling point to the outfall particularly between the adjacent downstream sites i e d1 and d2 as shown in fig 5b indicating dilution attenuation effect of river water on the coalescence of stp effluents it was possible that the resistome community from effluents was more susceptible to attenuate relative to the one in the upstream river that leaded to a reduction in the contribution of stp effluents strickler et al 2015 for example microorganisms originally existed in the river have been filtrated by sunlight whereas the microorganisms and args in the effluents mostly come from the stp reservoir or pipeline network and may exist in the dark conditions during the transportation and discharge making their responses to sunlight irradiation more drastic and resulting in stronger attenuation in the coalesced river schultz fademrecht et al 2008 however some of these features may not exist in the stable coalesced river notably although our analyses quantified the resistome coalescence with the field based experiment the processes and factors that govern the coalescence event and its attenuation dynamics in the environment are very complex rillig et al 2015 to determinate deeply the fraction of driving forces i e mixing ratio flow velocity tributary inflow biotic interactions and abiotic filtering on the resistome coalescence more investigations should be considered in future via microcosm based controlled experiments 3 5 dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the river system the args presenting on mges in hbps had high dissemination risk martínez et al 2015 in the estp river system a total of 49 bacterial phyla were found and the dominators were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria verrucomicrobia and cyanobacteria fig s4 among them proteobacteria an indicator of human activities and urban pollution torres et al 2019 was the most abundant phylum especially in the stp effluents at the species level 4565 species were identified and most of the top 50 were assigned to proteobacteria fig s5 notably by comparing to the pathogen database 345 potential hbps were identified fig 6 a mainly belonging to proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes particularly several epidemic pathogens like kingella kingae yersinia enterocolitica and helicobacter pylori were also found in the estp river system among them the kingella kingae has high resistance to various common antibacterial drugs especially to penicillin and the helicobacter pylori can cause various stomach problems and even stomach cancer and more than half of people in the world have been infected with helicobacter pylori hooi et al 2017 the prevalence of these pathogenic bacteria in the estp river system posed a non negligible risk to public health when they are resistant to antibiotics as shown in fig 6b the co occurrence network of args with hbps showed multiple hbps took along multiple args in the environment they may be the potential arg hosts and play key role in the dissemination of args in environments forsberg et al 2014 ma et al 2017 regarding the mobility of resistome herein 72 mges were identified in the estp river system including integrases plasmids and transposases among them the most abundant mges were tnpa transposase is91 insert sequence and inti1 integrase accounting for 65 3 78 4 of the total mges for each sample fig s6 notably tnpa was also reported previously to be the main mge to influence the propagation of args in environments mazhar et al 2021 wang et al 2020b for inti1 an indicator marker of human activity it has been frequently detected in rivers with high abundance reflecting the influence of human activity on the prevalence of resistome in the environment zhang et al 2021 furthermore the co occurrence network of mges with args suggested the most well connected mges were iscr8 tnpa1 tnpa isbf10 and inti1 which presented strong correlations with more than 20 args fig s7 these mges have potentials to transfer multiple args facilitating the dissemination of args between different bacterial hosts likewise a recent study showed that mges had conceivable influence on arg shifts in water environment and the transfer likelihood of args from arb to human pathogens was proportional to the mges proportion zhang et al 2021 notably args were found to co exist with plasmid and insert sequence on some contigs such as incq1 sul2 is91 the prevalent of arg carrying plasmids in the environment plays important roles in acquisition and mobility of args among bacterial community importantly the args well connected with multiple mges were also closely connected with many hbps as discussed above fig 6b these args would have a high resistome dissemination risk since the args hosted by hbps could disseminate between different bacterial pathogens via hgt promoted by mges where they reside martínez et al 2015 further we conducted the contigs based analysis to explore the co occurrence of args with mges and virulence factor genes vfgs to identify the resistome dissemination risk the vfgs can aid pathogens in invading the hosts and escape the defense mechanisms of hosts causing infection and diseases durso et al 2011 importantly vfgs can be encoded on mges i e plasmids and phages and spread via horizontal gene transfer empowering harmless bacteria become pathogenic in the study 27 vfgs were found in the estp river system fig s8 among them offensive vfgs were the most diverse and abundant type accounting for about 40 of the total vfgs as reported previously opportunistic pathogen with more offensive vfgs was more virulent wang et al 2019 once the opportunistic pathogen carrying abundant offensive vfgs are prevalent in water environment and transmit to human public health will be threatened and when args and vfgs coexist with mges the health risk will further increase liang et al 2020 to demonstrate their co occurrences in the environment we identified three types of binned contigs that contain args arg mge and arg mge vfg like sequences and calculated the resistome risk score rrs for each sample as shown in fig 6c relatively the river sediments showed higher resistome risk than river waters indicating the accumulation of args mges and vfgs in the sediments due to community coalescence and horizontal gene transfer the migration rate of microbial community in sediment was much lower than that in river water liu et al 2018 thus attachment to sediments might increase chances of long term persistence of stp derived args in the environment as a whole the contig based co occurrence analysis confirmed the potential environmental risk of coalesced resistome in the river system since the bacteria co carrying vfgs mges and args will be pathogenic and empower pathogen be resistant to target antibiotics tang et al 2021 liang et al 2020 nevertheless it should be noted that the resistome risk need to be further validated using culture based method and or function metagenomic approach 4 conclusion in this research we investigated systematically the resistome coalescence of stp effluents in an urban river apportioned quantitatively the coalescence event using a community based microbial source tracking tool and identified the dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the environment results showed that the coalescence of stp effluents in river increased the diversity and abundance of riverine resistome while the processes and factors that governed the coalescence event of resistome and its attenuation dynamics were complex mixing ratio sunlight priority effect and environmental conditions would dominate the fluctuation and stabilization of the coalesced resistome community which was particularly evident for the args imported by the stp effluents making the contribution of effluents in the coalesced resistome decreasing with distance additionally our analyses showed potential dissemination risk of coalesced resistome in the river system and emphasized the role of river as a channel of resistance risk transmission

15503,for preparing high performance biochar to be applicated in persulfate based oxidation treatment of wastewater the feasibility of deriving fe n biochar from pharmaceutical sludge by endogenous fe and exogenous n doping was investigated with exogenous urea doping fexn contained biochar pzbc800u was successfully derived from endogenous fe oh 3 contained pharmaceutical sludge pzbc800u effectively activated peroxymonosulfate pms to remove 80 mg l 1 levofloxacin lev within 90 min the main mechanism of pms activation by pzbc800u for lev degradation was revealed as non radical pathways dominated by 1o2 generation and direct electron transfer the formation of fexn combined with the increase of pyridinic n in the biochar changed the electronic structure improved the electron transfer ability and thus achieved the excellent pms activation capacity of the biochar the vital function of endogenous fe oh 3 was verified by comparing pzbc800u to fe leached and extra fe added controls a total of 18 intermediates in the degradation of lev were identified and degradation pathways were proposed combined with the average local ionization energy calculation the priority of piperazine breakage during lev degradation was experimentally proved and mechanistically elucidated this study provides a new insight into fexn biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent pms activation performance for lev degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceutical sludge biochar levofloxacin persulfate catalytic degradation 1 introduction fluoroquinolones fqs are a class of third generation quinolone antibiotics that have a fluorine atom at c6 position of the quinolone ring which can inhibit the activity of two enzymes necessary for microbial dna replication transcription and translation sturini et al 2014 owing to the broad spectrum antibacterial property fqs are widely used in human and veterinary medicines shu et al 2021 the huge production usage and discharge have caused the widespread pollution of fqs in the environment up to ug l 1 of fqs have been detected in surface water groundwater and offshore waters li et al 2020 high concentrations of fqs are discharged from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants owing to the insufficient antibiotic removal performance of traditional biological treatment processes le page et al 2017 it is necessary to enhance the deep removal of fqs from pharmaceutical wastewater with advanced treatment processes advanced oxidation processes aops are effective in removing bio inhibiting antibiotic contaminants wang et al 2019 as peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxodisulfate pds can generate a variety of reactive oxygen species ros with strong oxidizing capacity such as hydroxyl radicals oh sulfate radicals so4 and singlet oxygen 1o2 persulfate based oxidation is an attractive aops for the removal of refractory organic pollutants wang and wang 2018 however activation of persulfate is a crucial step for achieving excellent oxidation performance carbon based materials such as reduced graphene oxide annealed nanodiamond carbon nanotube and biochar are potential catalysts for persulfate activation due to their environmental friendly characteristics and adjustable electronic structure luo et al 2022 among the carbon based catalysts biochar derived from biomass is an economical and promising material due to the availability and sustainability of waste biomass for biochar preparation liu et al 2015 sewage sludge derived biochar has shown the activity of persulfate activation chen et al 2020 pharmaceutical sludge is a by product generated from biological units of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants which usually adsorb antibiotics in high concentrations and thus hinder the application of anaerobic digestion into its treatment hou et al 2019 an advantage of pharmaceutical sludge is that its organic content is usually higher than that of municipal sludge which promotes the resourceful treatment of pharmaceutical sludge by pyrolysis for biochar preparation wu et al 2022 if high performance biochar could be prepared from pharmaceutical sludge as the catalyst and applied in aop treatment for antibiotics removal it will be an effective way to realize both the resource utilization of pharmaceutical sludge and the removal of wastewater antibiotics however owing to the limited active sites and weak electron transfer efficiency the catalytic activity and service life of sludge biochar catalysts are not satisfactory he et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to properly modify the biochar to improve its catalytic performance n doping and metal encapsulation are two effective modification methods under study n doping can increase the catalytic sites by changing the electron distribution of the carbon matrix liu et al 2019 through metal encapsulation the metal wrapped in the carbon matrix can improve the catalyst s electron transfer efficiency and serve as additional redox catalytic sites sang et al 2020 combining the above two modification methods loading the metal n structure onto the carbon matrix has been proposed as a more effective approach to enhance catalytic performance cui et al 2020 transition metals especially fe coordinated n doped carbon materials are becoming one of the most promising persulfate activation catalysts due to the abundant active sites and fast catalytic kinetics hu et al 2020 fe n structures such as fe nx wang et al 2017 and fexn hu et al 2020 usually have high catalytic performances if fe n structures could form in sludge biochar by fe and n doping the catalytic performance of sludge biochar will be significantly improved it is noteworthy that dewatered pharmaceutical sludge usually contains endogenous fe due to the application of ferric conditioning agents ge et al 2020 and due to the use of fenton pretreatment to improve the biodegradability of the high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater karthikeyan et al 2011 the iron sludge generated from fenton pretreatment is also used as the conditioning agent for promoting the dewatering of pharmaceutical sludge in many pharmaceutical factories resulting in high endogenous fe in the dewatered pharmaceutical sludge utilizing the endogenous fe combined with exogenous n doping might be an effective way to construct fe n structure in pharmaceutical sludge biochar meanwhile the manufactory costs can be reduced by utilizing the endogenous fe compared to exogenous fe addition however although studies have prepared fe and n co doped sludge biochar li et al 2022b wang et al 2020b fe n structures have not been produced in the sludge biochars the iron source in the reported studies was mainly fe2o3 or fe3o4 through fe doping using fe2o3 or fe3o4 coupled with n doping the fe2o3 and fe3o4 phases as well as n content in biochar were improved however fe n structure was not produced li et al 2022b wang et al 2020b fecl3 was often used as iron source in the preparation of fe and n co doped biochar from other biomass materials and the formation of fe nx structure with high catalytic performance was reported li et al 2021 xu et al 2020 up to now there is no study on fe doping using fe oh 3 as the iron source for fe and n co doped biochar preparation it is necessary to study whether fe n structure can be formed in biochar using fe oh 3 as the iron source therefore this study adopted a pharmaceutical sludge containing endogenous fe oh 3 from the conditioning fenton iron sludge as the substrate and applied urea as the exogenous nitrogen dopant to manufacture fe n contained biochar besides biochars derived from the sludge with fe leached by hydrofluoric acid treatment and from the sludge with extra fenton iron sludge added were also prepared as the fe decrement and fe increment controls to verify the vital function of the endogenous fe oh 3 the prepared fe n biochar was further applied to activate pms for oxidizing fqs antibiotics with levofloxacin lev as the representative the mechanisms of pms activated by the prepared fe n biochar for lev degradation were investigated with free radical quenching experiments electron spin resonance esr and electrochemical analysis the effect of fe n co doping on the electron structure of the biochar was analyzed with density functional theory dft calculations the possible pathways of lev degradation by pms oxidation activated with fe n biochar were also proposed the study could provide insights into fe n biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent pms activation performance for lev degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the pharmaceutical sludge used in this work was the dewatered sludge collected from a fqs antibiotics manufacturing factory in zhejiang province china the process of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant and the sampling point are shown in fig s1 the sludge was mainly the excess sludge of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant with approximate 10 fenton iron sludge added during dewatering the main element composition of the pharmaceutical sludge was c 35 19 h 5 19 n 7 03 and s 1 83 xps analysis indicated the high content of o and the containing of fe na ca al cl s and si in the sludge fig s2a the iron removed pharmaceutical sludge was prepared by immersing the raw pharmaceutical sludge in 1 m hcl and 10 v v hf to obtain extra fenton iron sludge containing pharmaceutical sludge 35 g raw pharmaceutical sludge was suspended in 500 ml water and fenton reaction was conducted by adding 15 g ferrous sulfate and 60 ml hydrogen peroxide at ph 2 after 1 h ph was adjusted to 7 and the sludge was collected and used as the extra fenton iron sludge contained pharmaceutical sludge the fe content of raw sludge iron removed sludge and extra fe added sludge were 244 69 3 15 mg g 1 82 53 1 34 mg g 1 and 381 70 6 82 mg g 1 with volatile solids vs total solids ts of 63 65 3 18 74 56 1 45 and 30 67 1 78 respectively table s1 the crystal phase of fe in the pharmaceutical sludge was supposed to be fe oh 3 based on xrd analysis fig s2b which was consistent with the main content of general fenton iron sludge wang zhao and zhang 2021 lev c18h20fn3o4 98 was purchased from aladdin chemical reagent company shanghai china 2 2 preparation of pharmaceutical sludge biochar non n doped pharmaceutical sludge biochar named pzbc800 was prepared with optimized parameters that obtained in our previous work wu et al 2022 briefly the dried pharmaceutical sludge was filtered through a 60 mesh sieve soaked in a 5 mol l 1 zncl2 solution with a weight volume of 1 1 for 24 h and then dried at 105 c to constant weight 50 g pretreated pharmaceutical sludge was placed in a tube furnace slg1100 100 shengli china for pyrolysis under oxygen limited condition with a continuous n2 flow of 100 ml min 1 the temperature of the furnace was increased to 800 c at the ramp of 10 c min 1 and then maintained at 800 c for 90 min the obtained biochar was washed with ultrapure water for three times and dried in an oven at 105 c prior to further application n doping was conducted on the basis of the optimized preparation parameters of the non n doped biochar zncl2 was also used the same as that for pzbc800 preparation to improve the specific surface area of the biochar the dried pharmaceutical sludge was filtered through a 60 mesh sieve soaked in a 5 mol l 1 zncl2 solution with a weight volume of 1 1 for 24 h and then dried at 105 c to constant weight subsequently 20 g of treated pharmaceutical sludge was mixed with urea solid with a weight weight of 1 3 which was the optimum among 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 obtained based on optimization experiment fig s3 the urea incorporated sludge was pyrolyzed under the procedure the same with non n doped biochar and the obtained biochar was named as pzbc800u the n doped biochar derived from fe removed sludge and fe extra added sludge were prepared with the same procedure of pzbc800u and were named as pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe respectively 2 3 catalytic degradation experiments all the catalytic degradation experiments were conducted in 250 ml conical flasks with 100 ml lev solution 80 mg l 1 ph 6 55 0 1 g l of biochar catalyst and 5 0 mm of pms under shaken at 25 c and 220 rpm in dark a control group without catalyst addition was also conducted samples collected from the flasks were filtered with a 0 22 μm filter and added with an equal volume of methanol immediately to terminate the reaction for investigating the effect of ph on the reaction lev degradation was evaluated at ph of 3 5 6 5 8 and 10 which was adjusted with 0 5 m h2so4 or 0 5 m naoh in addition the degradation experiments were conducted under 10 mm no3 10 mm cl and 10 mg l 1 humic acids ha sigma aldrich respectively to evaluate the effect of main inorganic anion and natural organic matter on lev degradation for testing the reusability of pharmaceutical sludge biochar the degradation experiments were carried out in four consecutive batches with the same biochar regeneration of the used biochar was conducted at 350 c for 4 h under oxygen limited condition the recovery of pms activation capacity of the regenerated biochar for lev degradation was also evaluated with consecutive batch degradation experiments real wastewater degradation experiment was conducted with the same dosage of biochar 0 1 g l and pms of 5 0 mm using secondary treatment effluent collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of the same pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant for sludge collection sampling site shown in fig s1 the water quality of the used wastewater are shown in table s2 in the quenching experiments methanol meoh was used as the quencher of so4 and oh tert butanol tba was used to quench oh furfuryl alcohol ffa p benzoquinone p bq and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were utilized to quench 1o2 o2 and surface free radicals respectively pei et al 2021 2 4 analytical methods the basic properties of the biochar catalysts were characterized based on bet

empirical dispersion the average local ionization energy alie quantitative three dimensional electrostatic potential 3d esp mapping images charge density difference maps and the highest occupied

physical and chemical properties of the prepared biochars the n content in pzbc800u pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe shown in table s3 were 2 18 2 30 and 2 41 respectively which were significantly higher than that in pzbc800 1 22 and indicated the successful doping of n in the biochars the fe content was 79 75 5 87 mg g 1 and 325 65 5 59 mg g 1 in pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe respectively while was 239 00 2 55 mg g 1 and 232 75 0 92 mg g 1 in pzbc800u and pzbc800 table s4 bet analysis revealed that the pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe had a higher and a lower sbet than pzbc800u respectively table s5 indicating the function of fe in improving the specific surface area of biochar fe dispersed into biochar can attenuate the shrink of biochar matrix during carbonization under pyrolysis rong et al 2019 wang et al 2015 besides fe2o3 may be formed as an intermediate or final product during pyrolysis of fe oh 3 contained sludge which could be used as a catalyst to gasify adjacent carbon materials into low molecular gases such as ch4 and co boudou et al 1998 while n doping slightly reduced the specific surface area of the biochar which supports the inference that the n doping might reduce the voids between the carbon structures liu et al 2020 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s4 of the prepared biochars fitted in the type i isotherm with h4 type hysteresis loops indicating that the pores were mainly micropores and mesopores and most of them were narrow crack pores gopinath et al 2021 sem eds also indicated the relatively inconspicuous holes and the improved n content of pzbc800u compared to pzbc800 fig s5 however the n doped pzbc800u still had a relatively high sbet of 334 34 m2 g 1 in addition id ig of pzbc800 and pzbc800u were 0 95 and 1 17 respectively fig s6 suggesting the higher defective degree of pzbc800u after n doping which also indicates a higher catalytic potential of pzbc800u liang et al 2017 xps survey further verified the n doping in the biochar fig 1 a as the n1s peak intensity of nitrogen doped biochars was significantly higher than that of pzbc800 high resolution n 1s xps spectrum of pzbc800 was deconvoluted into four peaks located at 398 5 ev 400 0 ev 401 5 ev and 405 6 ev fig 1b the fitted peak located at 398 5 ev was considered as pyridinic n while the other three peaks were considered as the pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidized n respectively duan et al 2015 among the above n species pyridinic n and pyrrole n could modify the electronic energy band structure of carbon materials to serve as active sites for catalytic reactions pietrzak et al 2010 compared to pzbc800 the pyridinic n content in the three n doped biochars was increased significantly which was beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic capacity in addition a relatively high content of fe n appeared in pzbc800u and pzbc800u fe indicated by the peak around 397 ev lei et al 2019 while the content of fe n in pzbc800u fe was very low the fe n was considered a major electrocatalytic active site owing to excellent electron transfer ability hu et al 2020 the higher fe n peak intensity of pzbc800u fe than pzbc800u as well as the weak fe n peak in pzbc800u fe indicated that the fe n species in the n doped biochar could be improved with the increased iron content in the sludge as well as the vital function of endogenous fe in fe n formation during pyrolysis besides n1s the c1s peak intensity of pzbc800u pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe were also higher than that of pzbc800 fig 1a which was consistent with the higher c content in the nitrogen doped biochars table s3 it might be because nitrogen doping improved the thermal stability of biochar and slowed the loss of c element during pyrolysis xiao et al 2018 the c1s spectrum of all biochars fig 1c has four peaks corresponding to c c c n c o c n c o and o c o respectively liang et al 2020 the c n content in nitrogen doped biochars was slightly higher than that in pzbc800 revealing that a part of the n was converted into c n during pyrolysis the fe2p regions of four kinds of biochars were fit into multiple peaks fig 1d the peaks at 710 3 ev and 723 9 ev were attributed to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of fe2 whereas the peaks at 712 0 ev and 725 6 ev corresponded to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of fe3 padervand et al 2021 the peaks at a binding energy of 718 6 ev and 733 0 ev were typical satellite peaks the content of the 2p3 2 of fe3 in pzbc800u and pzbc800u fe was increased which could be attributed to the formed fe3 n li et al 2017 the xrd pattern was used to analyze the crystal structure of fe in the prepared biochars fig 2 the pattern of pzbc800 mainly matched with the standard cards for zns pdf 75 1547 although zncl2 would vaporize under the pyrolysis temperature of 800 c zn was still detected in the biochar probably owing to the reaction of zn with s in the sludge and forming zns during pyrolysis the boiling point of zns is 1185 c much higher than 800 c therefore a small part of zn remained in biochar in the form of zns as shown in the xrd pattern the formation of zns inhibited the volatilization of sulfur which resulted in the high s content in pzbc800 the main part of fe in the pzbc800 was considered fe2o3 pdf 73 2234 according to the xrd pattern differently the main crystal structure in pzbc800u and pzbc800u fe was fexn x 2 3 4 pdf 50 0957 pdf 83 0878 and pdf 06 0627 that formed by endogenous fe and exogenous n doping though a small amount of fe2o3 and zns remained in the biochars as fexn have been shown to give an outstanding catalytic performance in a wide range of applications brumovsky et al 2022 excellent catalytic capacity of the biochars containing abundant fexn is expected based on analysis with wpf rietveld refinement method the relative content of fexn phases accounted for 75 63 in the pzbc800u shown in table s6 overwhelmed fe2o3 5 35 and zns 5 76 meanwhile only a very weak fexn signal was detected in pzbc800u fe due to the lower iron content in the sludge which was consistent with the results of xps nacl phase was detected in the n doped biochars with a small relative content of 6 54 14 52 which might be a reaction product of na existing in the sludge and cl from zncl2 during pyrolysis under n doping condition the fexn in pzbc800u observed by the tem shows an obvious core shell structure with a particle size of about 300 nm fig 3 which is consistent with the fexn reported in the literature liu et al 2018 hrtem images fig 3d demonstrate that the lattice spacing of continuous lattice fringes is about 0 22 nm which matches well with the 1 1 1 atomic planes of fe4n qian et al 2019 to further verify the involvement of fe oh 3 from fenton iron sludge in fexn formation the mixture of fe oh 3 and urea were treated under pyrolysis condition the same as biochar preparation xrd pattern of the product named as fe oh 3u highly matched the combined standard patterns of fe2n fe3n and fe4n and xps revealed a high fe n content in the product fig s7 the formation of abundant fexn in the biochar under endogenous fe and exogenous n doping condition and the key role of fe oh 3 from fenton iron sludge for fexn formation were solid proved it is worth noting that the dosage of urea did not determine whether fexn was formed fig s8 but affected the relative content of fexn phase table s7 fig s8 thus influenced the abundance of fe n species fig s9 the pzbc800u obtained under sludge urea ratio of 1 3 possessed the highest content of fexn phase which might be the reason for its higher catalytic performance than that obtained under other urea dosage 3 2 lev oxidation by biochar activated pms the removal of lev by pms oxidation activated by the prepared biochars is shown in fig 4 a without biochar addition the lev removal was 26 6 by oxidation of pms with addition of the biochars lev removal was significantly improved with removal efficiencies of 89 3 100 as the removal of lev by adsorption of pzbc800 pzbc800u pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe was only 14 3 6 2 3 4 and 10 4 respectively the improved lev removal in pms with biochar addition was mainly owing to the activation of pms by the prepared biochar with n doping pzbc800u exhibited better performance of pms activation for lev degradation than pzbc800 with pzbc800u activation pms oxidation completely removed lev within 90 minutes with a reaction rate constant kobs of 0 034 min 1 fig 4b after increasing the iron content in the sludge pzbc800u fe showed a higher pms activation performance which achieved 100 lev removal within 40 minutes and reached a kobs of 0 118 min 1 in comparison the kobs of lev removal by pms with pzbc800u fe addition were as low as 0 016 min 1 indicating fexn as the key catalytic active site of the biochar the pms activation ability of fexn was verified by the high kobs 0 044 min 1 of lev degradation in pms with fe oh 3u addition fig s10 which proved the function of fexn for pms activation in general the endogenous fe and exogenous n doped biochar pzbc800u achieved excellent pms activation performance for lev degradation the removal capacity reached up to 800 mg lev per gram pzbc800u which is very competitive by comparing to the reported sludge biochars and other catalysts table 1 a high concentration of lev at 80 mg l 1 was used in this study which was selected according to the high fqs concentrations at dozens of mg l in antibiotic production wastewater bao et al 2021 larsson et al 2007 the excellent performance of pzbc800 pms for the degradation of high concentration lev provided the possibility of application in high concentration antibiotic wastewater treatment the effects of ph temperature and main co existing substances on lev removal in pzbc800u pms system were also investigated ph is an important environmental factor that might influence the performances of adsorption and degradation by changing the electrification properties of pollutants and catalysts however the removal of lev by pzbc800u adsorption showed very small changes under different ph fig s11 though lev has different ionization characteristics wu et al 2022 and the zeta potential of pzbc800u changed significantly under different ph fig s12 the little change of lev removal by pzbc800u adsorption under different ph probably owing to the short reaction time and low biochar dosage also affected little on lev removal by pzbc800u pms lev removal by pzbc800u pms within 60 min reaction under ph of 3 5 6 5 8 and 10 were 96 40 93 90 95 82 93 80 and 94 52 respectively fig 5 a negligible influence of ph on lev degradation by pms activated with pzbc800u was revealed which was consistent with the ph insensitivity of fexn hu et al 2020 while a higher temperature significantly promoted lev degradation fig 5b which was owing to that the higher temperature makes the degradation easier to cross the energy barrier cl significantly increased the degradation rate of lev kobs 0 094 min 1 while no3 slightly inhibited the degradation of lev cl can react with pms to generate reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 and hocl with higher oxidation potential to synergistically degrade lev ahn et al 2021 however no3 can consume reactive substances to produce no3 that has lower oxidizing ability pei et al 2021 thus reducing the degradation rate of lev humic acid ha was selected as a typical natural organic matter to analyze the influence of organic matter on lev degradation a strong inhibition of lev degradation kobs 0 018 min 1 occurred under ha added condition probably owing to the competition of ha with lev for reactive oxidation substances zhu et al 2021 the metal concentrations in the liquid phase after pzbc800u pms degradation under different initial ph were detected to evaluate the metal leaching of the biochar as shown in table 2 the concentration of leached fe under initial ph of 3 6 5 and 10 were 0 96 0 13 mg l 1 0 53 0 079 mg l 1 and 0 57 0 093 mg l 1 respectively though fe leaching concentration under ph 3 was higher than that under ph 6 5 and ph 10 the fe concentration of 0 96 mg l 1 still indicated a low risk of pzbc800u application the reusability of pzbc800u was further explored fig 5d the fresh biochar activated pms degraded 95 of lev within 60 min while the removal efficiency decayed to 63 43 and 28 respectively when the biochar was once twice and thrice reused the decreased catalytic capacity of the used biochar might be attributed to multiple potential reasons first electron transfer and other reactions occurred during the degradation process which changed the surface chemical properties of pzbc800u and reduced its catalytically active sites guo et al 2018 secondly strong oxidizing substances generated in the degradation system attacked the carbon matrix and destroyed the active sites on the biochar saputra et al 2013 besides the degradation intermediates may be adsorbed on the surface of pzbc800u thus blocking the contact of catalytically active sites with the pms wang and wang 2019 all three of the above situations might occur during the reaction the catalytic capacity of the used biochar was largely recovered through thermal regeneration after each cycle fig 5d which indicated that the deposition of degradation intermediates on the catalytically active sites might be one of the main reasons for the decrease in catalytic capacity in addition electron transfer reactions and active sites consumption also contributed to the decreased catalytic capacity of the used biochar which is analyzed and discussed in the next section in order to reduce the regeneration cost and improve the feasibility of practical application the performance of regeneration after 4 times of use was also investigated fig s13 the removal of lev achieved 73 36 within 60 min by the biochar regenerated after 4 uses which indicated the good regeneration performance of the pzbc800u after multiple use in addition an increased biochar dosage could compensate for the decline in the catalytic performance of the biochar after each use under dosage of 0 33 mg l 1 the 3 cycles used biochar achieved a satisfied lev removal of 89 7 while the increased dosage of 0 33 mg l 1 still competitive among the reported catalysts table 1 the performance of pzbc800u pms in real wastewater treatment was also investigated with pzbc800u pms treatment under the same dosage the cod of the pharmaceutical wastewater decreased from 410 1 82 9 mg l 1 to 242 3 13 7 mg l 1 a total of 5 fqs and 2 macrolides mls antibiotics were detected in the wastewater the removal of each antibiotic ranged in 70 4 100 with total removal of fqs and mls reached 99 0 and 100 respectively table 3 the high removal of cod and antibiotics indicated the potential of applying pzbc800u pms in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 3 3 mechanistic insights into pms activation by fexn biochar generation of reactive species usually is one of the main mechanisms in pms activation free radical quenching experiments were conducted to identify the main reactive species produced in the pzbc800u pms system as illustrated in fig 6 the introduction of meoh and tba only achieved slight inhibition on lev degradation thus oh and so4 were not the main reactive species in the degradation while slightly stronger inhibition of tba than meoh on lev degradation 0 028 min 1 vs 0 020 min 1 indicated that there might be a certain number of free radicals existing on the surface of the biochar and the more hydrophilic meoh could not effectively quench them with a higher affinity than meoh dmso showed a higher inhibition of lem degradation which further indicated partial lev was degraded by surface free radicals pei et al 2021 esr characterization was used to further investigate the reactive species generated in the degradation system dmpo a commonly capture agent for oh and so4 could combine with oh and so4 to generate dmpo oh four lines 1 2 2 1 and dmpo so4 six lines 1 1 1 1 1 1 however esr did not detect these two signals but detected seven lines 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 fig 6c which was the product of direct oxidation of dmpo by 1o2 zhu et al 2021 for 1o2 temp can combine with it to generate temp 1o2 which shows a characteristic signal of three lines 1 1 1 in the esr spectrum as shown in fig 6c 1 o2 characteristic peaks were indeed detected by the esr spectrum applying temp the intensity of temp 1o2 increased when the solvent was changed from h2o to d2o fig s14 which was owing to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o than that in h2o wang et al 2020a and thus further confirmed the generation of 1o2 in pzbc800u pms system for verifying the contribution of 1o2 for oxidation ffa a well known quencher of 1o2 cheng et al 2017 was utilized as shown in fig 6a 25 mm ffa significantly inhibited lev degradation to removal of 41 7 from 100 in the control with increased concentration of ffa the inhibition was enhanced and resulted in a lev removal of 31 3 under 50 mm ffa fig s15 although ffa was demonstrated as not only a 1o2 quencher but also a scavenger for oh and so4 the low inhibition of lev degradation by meoh and tba have suggested the low contribution of oh and so4 in the reaction therefore the significant inhibition caused by ffa as well as 1o2 identification based on esr revealed that 1o2 was the dominant ros for lev degradation furthermore the effect of p benzoquinone p bq an effective superoxide radical o2 quencher on lev degradation was evaluated the addition of p bq inhibited lev degradation close to that of ffa as o2 is an important precursor for the formation of 1o2 it could be inferred that most of 1o2 were converted from o2 in addition further testing shows that the contribution of dissolved o2 for o2 and 1o2 generation in this ros system was negligible fig s16 these results revealed that the major oxidant for lev degradation generated from pms by pzbc800u activation was 1o2 in a non radical pathway doping could destroy the electronic charge distribution of the conjugated carbon skeleton in biochar increase defect sites and thus enhance the capacity of pms activation to generate 1o2 zaeni et al 2020 the significantly increased content of pyridinic n and the formed fexn in the biochar should be the root cause for the improvement of catalytic ability of pzbc800u electron transfer mechanism is another potential non radical pathway that is able to activate pms for pollutant degradation yun et al 2018 a positive current was observed when pms was added to the biochars and the current in pzbc800u pms and pzbc800u fe pms were much higher than that in the other two biochar reactions fig 6d it indicated that the active sites on the biochars could immediately react with pms to form reactive species he et al 2021 and the reactivity of fexn rich biochars were much higher than other biochars after lev addition the pzbc800u pms system had an obvious negative current change which suggested the role of electron transfer from lev to pms through pzbc800u electronic impedance spectroscopy eis also revealed the better charge transfer ability of pzbc800u fig s17 the coexistence of pyridinic n and metal n could supply excellent charge transfer performance for materials which was considered to be an efficient catalytic active site feng et al 2020 the fexn in the fe and n doped pzbc800u might be the main reason for its better electron transfer ability the higher current response of pzbc800u fe and the significantly lower response of pzbc800u fe fig 6d supported the important role of fexn in electron transfer of the biochar quantum chemistry calculation based on dft was adopted to further demonstrate the mechanisms the graphene model was used to represent the biochar and fexn was simplified to the fe n model for dft calculation fig s18a it was revealed that the fe n doping extended the positive potential energy range of surface electrostatic potential esp to 150 kcal mol 1 and pyridinic n extended the negative potential energy range of esp to 150 kcal mol 1 compared to the unadulterated biochar in the range of 20 20 kcal mol 1 fig s18b which gave pzbc800u a higher potential for pms activation electron flow analysis indicated that fe n doping made a stronger electron transfer channel between the biochar and pms than the unadulterated and n doping biochars fig 7 which might be due to the chemical adsorption of pms at the fe n sites and the formation of a strong fe o covalent bond bond length was 1 84 å fig s19 in addition the adsorption of pms by fe n in the biochar significantly prolonged the bond length of the o o in pms fig s19 which made pms easier to decompose he et al 2022 the energy gap of the biochar was gradually narrowed with sequential doping of n and fe fig 7d indicated that the pyridinic n and fe n in the biochar could significantly increase the catalytic activity by reducing the energy barrier owing to the small energy gap electrons in the homo 5 796 ev of lev easily transferred to the lumo 2 186 ev of pms through fe and n co doped pzbc800u by forming an electron channel between lev pzbc800u and pms dou et al 2022 xps analysis revealed the consumption of fe n and pyridinic n in the biochar during activating pms for lev degradation fig 8 a which confirmed that fe n and pyridinic n were the main active site in the catalytic reaction comparing the catalytic performance of the biochars fig 4a the endogenous fe doped pzbc800 achieved 78 25 lev removal and the fe removed biochar pzbc800u fe achieved a lev removal of 85 92 by deduction of the adsorption removal from the catalytic reaction group the results indicated the higher performance of n doping on improving the catalytic ability than fe doping in addition the dft calculation shown in fig 7d also indicated that n doping contributes more to the reduction of the energy band gap of the biochar up to 68 0 while further fe doping only achieved a reduction of 25 6 n doping may contribute more to the activation of pms than fe doping nevertheless endogenous fe and exogenous n co doping could achieve a significant improvement in catalytic performance by forming fexn the electron rich oxygen containing functional groups represented by c o was supposed to play an important role in the activation of pms in some condition however the similar content of c o before and after catalytic reaction suggested that c o was not the main active sites for pms activation by pzbc800u fig 8b in addition although zn is a transition metal and may has certain catalytic potential the contribution of zn involved in activating pms is not significant in this study xps and xrd indicated the higher zn content in pzbc800 than that in pzbc800u however the catalytic performance of pzbc800 was much lower than that of pzbc800u besides the peak of zn in xps spectrum of the biochar hardly changed before and after the 3 uses fig s20 in summary fexn formed by endogenous fe and exogenous n doping combined with the pyridinic n played a key role in pms activation for lev degradation the fexn and pyridinic n greatly changed the electronic properties and enhanced the electron transfer ability of the biochar enabling pzbc800u to possess a strong driving force for activating pms to generate 1o2 and act as a mediator of electron transfer from lev to pms thereby improving the degradation of lev 3 4 lev degradation pathways under pms oxidation activated by fexn biochar total organic carbon toc analysis showed that the removal of toc was much lower than the removal of lev fig s21a which indicated the existence of degradation intermediates a total of 18 intermediates were identified by lc tof ms analysis table s8 six possible degradation pathways of lev including demethylation hydroxylation piperazine ring opening carboxylation de carboxylation oxidation of quinolone rings and defluorination were proposed fig 9 a in pathway i r1 was generated by replacing the methyl on piperazinyl ring with a hydroxyl group and then the fluorine in r1 was substituted with a hydroxyl converting to r2 under the attack of oh zhong et al 2021 in pathway ii demethylation might be the first step then r3 was formed owing to cleavage of piperazine ring piperazine residues were further attacked by active species and gradually generated r6 via r4 and r5 in pathway iii piperazine ring was cleaved prior to demethylation forming r7 and the carbonyl group and single bond ch3 were further removed generating r8 and r9 in pathway iv r10 was generated through decarboxylation which was further degraded to r11 and r12 in pathway v r13 was formed by oxidation of quinolone rings and replacement of the fluorine by a hydroxyl and then quinolone residues were further degraded generating r16 via r14 and r15 by the attack of 1o2 lyu et al 2020 in pathway vi r17 was generated through piperazine ring cleavage and defluorination and then converted to r18 through shedding piperazinyl residues and demethylation of the quinolone ring based on evaluation by t e s t toxicity of r1 was slightly higher than that of lev and all other intermediates possess a much lower toxicity compared to lev table s8 it could be inferred that the toxicity of lev was effectively reduced after pms oxidation activated by pzbc800u it was worth noting that 11 of the 18 degradation intermediates were generated by destroying the piperazine ring this might be due to the breaking of the piperazine ring was easier than that of quinolone ring and the c f bond during the degradation process to further confirm alie analysis was used to evaluate the electrophilic points of the lev molecule since the electron binding ability is relatively weak near low alie position electrophilic reactions and free radical reactions are more likely to occur at the position with the lowest alie value deng et al 2019 in the pzbc800u pms system 1o2 is the main oxidation species and its π2p orbital is an unoccupied orbital which has strong electrophilic activity and thus tends to attack areas where electrons are concentrated yin et al 2019 the proposed degradation pathways were well fit with the four relatively low alie areas on the lev molecule fig 9b the piperazine ring and its connected methyl possess the smallest alie 8 51 8 96 and 7 49 ev demonstrating that 1o2 and free radicals were more likely to attack this area which resulted in the preferential degradation of piperazine ring and demethylation in the pms oxidation system activated by pzbc800u alie in the area around the fluorine on the quinolone ring was relatively low but still much higher than that of piperazine ring area therefore though defluorinated intermediates were detected defluorination was not the main pathway for lev degradation which was confirmed by the low defluorination rate 9 57 revealed by measuring the detached fluorine fig s21b since the electron rich piperazine ring of lev is more attractive for 1o2 oxidation while defluorination of lev is mainly based on attacking c f by hydroxyl radical zhong et al 2021 the breakage of the piperazine ring would be the primary way of lev degradation in pzbc800 pms which was mainly via non radical pathways conclusions in this study fexn biochar pzbc800u was successfully derived from endogenous fe oh 3 contained pharmaceutical sludge with exogenous n doping pzbc800u could effectively activate pms for lev degradation in a wide ph range the main mechanism of pms activation by pzbc800u for lev degradation was the non radical pathways including the generation of 1o2 and electron transfer the formation of fe n synergized with pyridinic n greatly disturbed the uniform electronic distribution and improved the electron transfer capability of biochar resulting in the strong pms activation ability of pzbc800u for lev degradation demethylation hydroxylation piperazine ring opening carboxylation de carboxylation oxidation of quinolone rings and defluorination were the detected lev degradation pathways in which piperazine ring opening and demethylation were the priority steps owing to the low alie this study provides a new insight into fe n biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent performance of pms activation for lev degradation credit authorship contribution statement qinyue

15503,for preparing high performance biochar to be applicated in persulfate based oxidation treatment of wastewater the feasibility of deriving fe n biochar from pharmaceutical sludge by endogenous fe and exogenous n doping was investigated with exogenous urea doping fexn contained biochar pzbc800u was successfully derived from endogenous fe oh 3 contained pharmaceutical sludge pzbc800u effectively activated peroxymonosulfate pms to remove 80 mg l 1 levofloxacin lev within 90 min the main mechanism of pms activation by pzbc800u for lev degradation was revealed as non radical pathways dominated by 1o2 generation and direct electron transfer the formation of fexn combined with the increase of pyridinic n in the biochar changed the electronic structure improved the electron transfer ability and thus achieved the excellent pms activation capacity of the biochar the vital function of endogenous fe oh 3 was verified by comparing pzbc800u to fe leached and extra fe added controls a total of 18 intermediates in the degradation of lev were identified and degradation pathways were proposed combined with the average local ionization energy calculation the priority of piperazine breakage during lev degradation was experimentally proved and mechanistically elucidated this study provides a new insight into fexn biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent pms activation performance for lev degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceutical sludge biochar levofloxacin persulfate catalytic degradation 1 introduction fluoroquinolones fqs are a class of third generation quinolone antibiotics that have a fluorine atom at c6 position of the quinolone ring which can inhibit the activity of two enzymes necessary for microbial dna replication transcription and translation sturini et al 2014 owing to the broad spectrum antibacterial property fqs are widely used in human and veterinary medicines shu et al 2021 the huge production usage and discharge have caused the widespread pollution of fqs in the environment up to ug l 1 of fqs have been detected in surface water groundwater and offshore waters li et al 2020 high concentrations of fqs are discharged from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants owing to the insufficient antibiotic removal performance of traditional biological treatment processes le page et al 2017 it is necessary to enhance the deep removal of fqs from pharmaceutical wastewater with advanced treatment processes advanced oxidation processes aops are effective in removing bio inhibiting antibiotic contaminants wang et al 2019 as peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxodisulfate pds can generate a variety of reactive oxygen species ros with strong oxidizing capacity such as hydroxyl radicals oh sulfate radicals so4 and singlet oxygen 1o2 persulfate based oxidation is an attractive aops for the removal of refractory organic pollutants wang and wang 2018 however activation of persulfate is a crucial step for achieving excellent oxidation performance carbon based materials such as reduced graphene oxide annealed nanodiamond carbon nanotube and biochar are potential catalysts for persulfate activation due to their environmental friendly characteristics and adjustable electronic structure luo et al 2022 among the carbon based catalysts biochar derived from biomass is an economical and promising material due to the availability and sustainability of waste biomass for biochar preparation liu et al 2015 sewage sludge derived biochar has shown the activity of persulfate activation chen et al 2020 pharmaceutical sludge is a by product generated from biological units of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants which usually adsorb antibiotics in high concentrations and thus hinder the application of anaerobic digestion into its treatment hou et al 2019 an advantage of pharmaceutical sludge is that its organic content is usually higher than that of municipal sludge which promotes the resourceful treatment of pharmaceutical sludge by pyrolysis for biochar preparation wu et al 2022 if high performance biochar could be prepared from pharmaceutical sludge as the catalyst and applied in aop treatment for antibiotics removal it will be an effective way to realize both the resource utilization of pharmaceutical sludge and the removal of wastewater antibiotics however owing to the limited active sites and weak electron transfer efficiency the catalytic activity and service life of sludge biochar catalysts are not satisfactory he et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to properly modify the biochar to improve its catalytic performance n doping and metal encapsulation are two effective modification methods under study n doping can increase the catalytic sites by changing the electron distribution of the carbon matrix liu et al 2019 through metal encapsulation the metal wrapped in the carbon matrix can improve the catalyst s electron transfer efficiency and serve as additional redox catalytic sites sang et al 2020 combining the above two modification methods loading the metal n structure onto the carbon matrix has been proposed as a more effective approach to enhance catalytic performance cui et al 2020 transition metals especially fe coordinated n doped carbon materials are becoming one of the most promising persulfate activation catalysts due to the abundant active sites and fast catalytic kinetics hu et al 2020 fe n structures such as fe nx wang et al 2017 and fexn hu et al 2020 usually have high catalytic performances if fe n structures could form in sludge biochar by fe and n doping the catalytic performance of sludge biochar will be significantly improved it is noteworthy that dewatered pharmaceutical sludge usually contains endogenous fe due to the application of ferric conditioning agents ge et al 2020 and due to the use of fenton pretreatment to improve the biodegradability of the high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater karthikeyan et al 2011 the iron sludge generated from fenton pretreatment is also used as the conditioning agent for promoting the dewatering of pharmaceutical sludge in many pharmaceutical factories resulting in high endogenous fe in the dewatered pharmaceutical sludge utilizing the endogenous fe combined with exogenous n doping might be an effective way to construct fe n structure in pharmaceutical sludge biochar meanwhile the manufactory costs can be reduced by utilizing the endogenous fe compared to exogenous fe addition however although studies have prepared fe and n co doped sludge biochar li et al 2022b wang et al 2020b fe n structures have not been produced in the sludge biochars the iron source in the reported studies was mainly fe2o3 or fe3o4 through fe doping using fe2o3 or fe3o4 coupled with n doping the fe2o3 and fe3o4 phases as well as n content in biochar were improved however fe n structure was not produced li et al 2022b wang et al 2020b fecl3 was often used as iron source in the preparation of fe and n co doped biochar from other biomass materials and the formation of fe nx structure with high catalytic performance was reported li et al 2021 xu et al 2020 up to now there is no study on fe doping using fe oh 3 as the iron source for fe and n co doped biochar preparation it is necessary to study whether fe n structure can be formed in biochar using fe oh 3 as the iron source therefore this study adopted a pharmaceutical sludge containing endogenous fe oh 3 from the conditioning fenton iron sludge as the substrate and applied urea as the exogenous nitrogen dopant to manufacture fe n contained biochar besides biochars derived from the sludge with fe leached by hydrofluoric acid treatment and from the sludge with extra fenton iron sludge added were also prepared as the fe decrement and fe increment controls to verify the vital function of the endogenous fe oh 3 the prepared fe n biochar was further applied to activate pms for oxidizing fqs antibiotics with levofloxacin lev as the representative the mechanisms of pms activated by the prepared fe n biochar for lev degradation were investigated with free radical quenching experiments electron spin resonance esr and electrochemical analysis the effect of fe n co doping on the electron structure of the biochar was analyzed with density functional theory dft calculations the possible pathways of lev degradation by pms oxidation activated with fe n biochar were also proposed the study could provide insights into fe n biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent pms activation performance for lev degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the pharmaceutical sludge used in this work was the dewatered sludge collected from a fqs antibiotics manufacturing factory in zhejiang province china the process of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant and the sampling point are shown in fig s1 the sludge was mainly the excess sludge of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant with approximate 10 fenton iron sludge added during dewatering the main element composition of the pharmaceutical sludge was c 35 19 h 5 19 n 7 03 and s 1 83 xps analysis indicated the high content of o and the containing of fe na ca al cl s and si in the sludge fig s2a the iron removed pharmaceutical sludge was prepared by immersing the raw pharmaceutical sludge in 1 m hcl and 10 v v hf to obtain extra fenton iron sludge containing pharmaceutical sludge 35 g raw pharmaceutical sludge was suspended in 500 ml water and fenton reaction was conducted by adding 15 g ferrous sulfate and 60 ml hydrogen peroxide at ph 2 after 1 h ph was adjusted to 7 and the sludge was collected and used as the extra fenton iron sludge contained pharmaceutical sludge the fe content of raw sludge iron removed sludge and extra fe added sludge were 244 69 3 15 mg g 1 82 53 1 34 mg g 1 and 381 70 6 82 mg g 1 with volatile solids vs total solids ts of 63 65 3 18 74 56 1 45 and 30 67 1 78 respectively table s1 the crystal phase of fe in the pharmaceutical sludge was supposed to be fe oh 3 based on xrd analysis fig s2b which was consistent with the main content of general fenton iron sludge wang zhao and zhang 2021 lev c18h20fn3o4 98 was purchased from aladdin chemical reagent company shanghai china 2 2 preparation of pharmaceutical sludge biochar non n doped pharmaceutical sludge biochar named pzbc800 was prepared with optimized parameters that obtained in our previous work wu et al 2022 briefly the dried pharmaceutical sludge was filtered through a 60 mesh sieve soaked in a 5 mol l 1 zncl2 solution with a weight volume of 1 1 for 24 h and then dried at 105 c to constant weight 50 g pretreated pharmaceutical sludge was placed in a tube furnace slg1100 100 shengli china for pyrolysis under oxygen limited condition with a continuous n2 flow of 100 ml min 1 the temperature of the furnace was increased to 800 c at the ramp of 10 c min 1 and then maintained at 800 c for 90 min the obtained biochar was washed with ultrapure water for three times and dried in an oven at 105 c prior to further application n doping was conducted on the basis of the optimized preparation parameters of the non n doped biochar zncl2 was also used the same as that for pzbc800 preparation to improve the specific surface area of the biochar the dried pharmaceutical sludge was filtered through a 60 mesh sieve soaked in a 5 mol l 1 zncl2 solution with a weight volume of 1 1 for 24 h and then dried at 105 c to constant weight subsequently 20 g of treated pharmaceutical sludge was mixed with urea solid with a weight weight of 1 3 which was the optimum among 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 obtained based on optimization experiment fig s3 the urea incorporated sludge was pyrolyzed under the procedure the same with non n doped biochar and the obtained biochar was named as pzbc800u the n doped biochar derived from fe removed sludge and fe extra added sludge were prepared with the same procedure of pzbc800u and were named as pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe respectively 2 3 catalytic degradation experiments all the catalytic degradation experiments were conducted in 250 ml conical flasks with 100 ml lev solution 80 mg l 1 ph 6 55 0 1 g l of biochar catalyst and 5 0 mm of pms under shaken at 25 c and 220 rpm in dark a control group without catalyst addition was also conducted samples collected from the flasks were filtered with a 0 22 μm filter and added with an equal volume of methanol immediately to terminate the reaction for investigating the effect of ph on the reaction lev degradation was evaluated at ph of 3 5 6 5 8 and 10 which was adjusted with 0 5 m h2so4 or 0 5 m naoh in addition the degradation experiments were conducted under 10 mm no3 10 mm cl and 10 mg l 1 humic acids ha sigma aldrich respectively to evaluate the effect of main inorganic anion and natural organic matter on lev degradation for testing the reusability of pharmaceutical sludge biochar the degradation experiments were carried out in four consecutive batches with the same biochar regeneration of the used biochar was conducted at 350 c for 4 h under oxygen limited condition the recovery of pms activation capacity of the regenerated biochar for lev degradation was also evaluated with consecutive batch degradation experiments real wastewater degradation experiment was conducted with the same dosage of biochar 0 1 g l and pms of 5 0 mm using secondary treatment effluent collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of the same pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant for sludge collection sampling site shown in fig s1 the water quality of the used wastewater are shown in table s2 in the quenching experiments methanol meoh was used as the quencher of so4 and oh tert butanol tba was used to quench oh furfuryl alcohol ffa p benzoquinone p bq and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were utilized to quench 1o2 o2 and surface free radicals respectively pei et al 2021 2 4 analytical methods the basic properties of the biochar catalysts were characterized based on bet sem tem xrd xps raman spectra and element contents with instruments described in text s1 lev concentration and degradation intermediates were respectively determined by a hplc agress 1100 elite china and a lc tof ms maldi synapt ms waters usa with parameters described in text s2 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 4 amino 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp were used as capture reagents to measure the generation of ros in the system on an electron spin resonance spectrometer a300 bruker germany impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry were performed by an electrochemical station

5 dft calculation the geometry structures frequencies summary of electronic and thermal energies of models were performed with gaussian16 software package gaussian inc usa in detail the geometries optimization and frequency analyses of the model system were conducted with the becke s 3 parameters and the lee yang parr s nonlocal correlation functional b3lyp 6 311g d p basis set with d3 empirical dispersion the average local ionization energy alie quantitative three dimensional electrostatic potential 3d esp mapping images charge density difference maps and the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo maps were calculated using multiwfn v 3 8 and plotted by vmd programs v 1 9 4 tian and feiwu 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical properties of the prepared biochars the n content in pzbc800u pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe shown in table s3 were 2 18 2 30 and 2 41 respectively which were significantly higher than that in pzbc800 1 22 and indicated the successful doping of n in the biochars the fe content was 79 75 5 87 mg g 1 and 325 65 5 59 mg g 1 in pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe respectively while was 239 00 2 55 mg g 1 and 232 75 0 92 mg g 1 in pzbc800u and pzbc800 table s4 bet analysis revealed that the pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe had a higher and a lower sbet than pzbc800u respectively table s5 indicating the function of fe in improving the specific surface area of biochar fe dispersed into biochar can attenuate the shrink of biochar matrix during carbonization under pyrolysis rong et al 2019 wang et al 2015 besides fe2o3 may be formed as an intermediate or final product during pyrolysis of fe oh 3 contained sludge which could be used as a catalyst to gasify adjacent carbon materials into low molecular gases such as ch4 and co boudou et al 1998 while n doping slightly reduced the specific surface area of the biochar which supports the inference that the n doping might reduce the voids between the carbon structures liu et al 2020 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s4 of the prepared biochars fitted in the type i isotherm with h4 type hysteresis loops indicating that the pores were mainly micropores and mesopores and most of them were narrow crack pores gopinath et al 2021 sem eds also indicated the relatively inconspicuous holes and the improved n content of pzbc800u compared to pzbc800 fig s5 however the n doped pzbc800u still had a relatively high sbet of 334 34 m2 g 1 in addition id ig of pzbc800 and pzbc800u were 0 95 and 1 17 respectively fig s6 suggesting the higher defective degree of pzbc800u after n doping which also indicates a higher catalytic potential of pzbc800u liang et al 2017 xps survey further verified the n doping in the biochar fig 1 a as the n1s peak intensity of nitrogen doped biochars was significantly higher than that of pzbc800 high resolution n 1s xps spectrum of pzbc800 was deconvoluted into four peaks located at 398 5 ev 400 0 ev 401 5 ev and 405 6 ev fig 1b the fitted peak located at 398 5 ev was considered as pyridinic n while the other three peaks were considered as the pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidized n respectively duan et al 2015 among the above n species pyridinic n and pyrrole n could modify the electronic energy band structure of carbon materials to serve as active sites for catalytic reactions pietrzak et al 2010 compared to pzbc800 the pyridinic n content in the three n doped biochars was increased significantly which was beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic capacity in addition a relatively high content of fe n appeared in pzbc800u and pzbc800u fe indicated by the peak around 397 ev lei et al 2019 while the content of fe n in pzbc800u fe was very low the fe n was considered a major electrocatalytic active site owing to excellent electron transfer ability hu et al 2020 the higher fe n peak intensity of pzbc800u fe than pzbc800u as well as the weak fe n peak in pzbc800u fe indicated that the fe n species in the n doped biochar could be improved with the increased iron content in the sludge as well as the vital function of endogenous fe in fe n formation during pyrolysis besides n1s the c1s peak intensity of pzbc800u pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe were also higher than that of pzbc800 fig 1a which was consistent with the higher c content in the nitrogen doped biochars table s3 it might be because nitrogen doping improved the thermal stability of biochar and slowed the loss of c element during pyrolysis xiao et al 2018 the c1s spectrum of all biochars fig 1c has four peaks corresponding to c c c n c o c n c o and o c o respectively liang et al 2020 the c n content in nitrogen doped biochars was slightly higher than that in pzbc800 revealing that a part of the n was converted into c n during pyrolysis the fe2p regions of four kinds of biochars were fit into multiple peaks fig 1d the peaks at 710 3 ev and 723 9 ev were attributed to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of fe2 whereas the peaks at 712 0 ev and 725 6 ev corresponded to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of fe3 padervand et al 2021 the peaks at a binding energy of 718 6 ev and 733 0 ev were typical satellite peaks the content of the 2p3 2 of fe3 in pzbc800u and pzbc800u fe was increased which could be attributed to the formed fe3 n li et al 2017 the xrd pattern was used to analyze the crystal structure of fe in the prepared biochars fig 2 the pattern of pzbc800 mainly matched with the standard cards for zns pdf 75 1547 although zncl2 would vaporize under the pyrolysis temperature of 800 c zn was still detected in the biochar probably owing to the reaction of zn with s in the sludge and forming zns during pyrolysis the boiling point of zns is 1185 c much higher than 800 c therefore a small part of zn remained in biochar in the form of zns as shown in the xrd pattern the formation of zns inhibited the volatilization of sulfur which resulted in the high s content in pzbc800 the main part of fe in the pzbc800 was considered fe2o3 pdf 73 2234 according to the xrd pattern differently the main crystal structure in pzbc800u and pzbc800u fe was fexn x 2 3 4 pdf 50 0957 pdf 83 0878 and pdf 06 0627 that formed by endogenous fe and exogenous n doping though a small amount of fe2o3 and zns remained in the biochars as fexn have been shown to give an outstanding catalytic performance in a wide range of applications brumovsky et al 2022 excellent catalytic capacity of the biochars containing abundant fexn is expected based on analysis with wpf rietveld refinement method the relative content of fexn phases accounted for 75 63 in the pzbc800u shown in table s6 overwhelmed fe2o3 5 35 and zns 5 76 meanwhile only a very weak fexn signal was detected in pzbc800u fe due to the lower iron content in the sludge which was consistent with the results of xps nacl phase was detected in the n doped biochars with a small relative content of 6 54 14 52 which might be a reaction product of na existing in the sludge and cl from zncl2 during pyrolysis under n doping condition the fexn in pzbc800u observed by the tem shows an obvious core shell structure with a particle size of about 300 nm fig 3 which is consistent with the fexn reported in the literature liu et al 2018 hrtem images fig 3d demonstrate that the lattice spacing of continuous lattice fringes is about 0 22 nm which matches well with the 1 1 1 atomic planes of fe4n qian et al 2019 to further verify the involvement of fe oh 3 from fenton iron sludge in fexn formation the mixture of fe oh 3 and urea were treated under pyrolysis condition the same as biochar preparation xrd pattern of the product named as fe oh 3u highly matched the combined standard patterns of fe2n fe3n and fe4n and xps revealed a high fe n content in the product fig s7 the formation of abundant fexn in the biochar under endogenous fe and exogenous n doping condition and the key role of fe oh 3 from fenton iron sludge for fexn formation were solid proved it is worth noting that the dosage of urea did not determine whether fexn was formed fig s8 but affected the relative content of fexn phase table s7 fig s8 thus influenced the abundance of fe n species fig s9 the pzbc800u obtained under sludge urea ratio of 1 3 possessed the highest content of fexn phase which might be the reason for its higher catalytic performance than that obtained under other urea dosage 3 2 lev oxidation by biochar activated pms the removal of lev by pms oxidation activated by the prepared biochars is shown in fig 4 a without biochar addition the lev removal was 26 6 by oxidation of pms with addition of the biochars lev removal was significantly improved with removal efficiencies of 89 3 100 as the removal of lev by adsorption of pzbc800 pzbc800u pzbc800u fe and pzbc800u fe was only 14 3 6 2 3 4 and 10 4 respectively the improved lev removal in pms with biochar addition was mainly owing to the activation of pms by the prepared biochar with n doping pzbc800u exhibited better performance of pms activation for lev degradation than pzbc800 with pzbc800u activation pms oxidation completely removed lev within 90 minutes with a reaction rate constant kobs of 0 034 min 1 fig 4b after increasing the iron content in the sludge pzbc800u fe showed a higher pms activation performance which achieved 100 lev removal within 40 minutes and reached a kobs of 0 118 min 1 in comparison the kobs of lev removal by pms with pzbc800u fe addition were as low as 0 016 min 1 indicating fexn as the key catalytic active site of the biochar the pms activation ability of fexn was verified by the high kobs 0 044 min 1 of lev degradation in pms with fe oh 3u addition fig s10 which proved the function of fexn for pms activation in general the endogenous fe and exogenous n doped biochar pzbc800u achieved excellent pms activation performance for lev degradation the removal capacity reached up to 800 mg lev per gram pzbc800u which is very competitive by comparing to the reported sludge biochars and other catalysts table 1 a high concentration of lev at 80 mg l 1 was used in this study which was selected according to the high fqs concentrations at dozens of mg l in antibiotic production wastewater bao et al 2021 larsson et al 2007 the excellent performance of pzbc800 pms for the degradation of high concentration lev provided the possibility of application in high concentration antibiotic wastewater treatment the effects of ph temperature and main co existing substances on lev removal in pzbc800u pms system were also investigated ph is an important environmental factor that might influence the performances of adsorption and degradation by changing the electrification properties of pollutants and catalysts however the removal of lev by pzbc800u adsorption showed very small changes under different ph fig s11 though lev has different ionization characteristics wu et al 2022 and the zeta potential of pzbc800u changed significantly under different ph fig s12 the little change of lev removal by pzbc800u adsorption under different ph probably owing to the short reaction time and low biochar dosage also affected little on lev removal by pzbc800u pms lev removal by pzbc800u pms within 60 min reaction under ph of 3 5 6 5 8 and 10 were 96 40 93 90 95 82 93 80 and 94 52 respectively fig 5 a negligible influence of ph on lev degradation by pms activated with pzbc800u was revealed which was consistent with the ph insensitivity of fexn hu et al 2020 while a higher temperature significantly promoted lev degradation fig 5b which was owing to that the higher temperature makes the degradation easier to cross the energy barrier cl significantly increased the degradation rate of lev kobs 0 094 min 1 while no3 slightly inhibited the degradation of lev cl can react with pms to generate reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 and hocl with higher oxidation potential to synergistically degrade lev ahn et al 2021 however no3 can consume reactive substances to produce no3 that has lower oxidizing ability pei et al 2021 thus reducing the degradation rate of lev humic acid ha was selected as a typical natural organic matter to analyze the influence of organic matter on lev degradation a strong inhibition of lev degradation kobs 0 018 min 1 occurred under ha added condition probably owing to the competition of ha with lev for reactive oxidation substances zhu et al 2021 the metal concentrations in the liquid phase after pzbc800u pms degradation under different initial ph were detected to evaluate the metal leaching of the biochar as shown in table 2 the concentration of leached fe under initial ph of 3 6 5 and 10 were 0 96 0 13 mg l 1 0 53 0 079 mg l 1 and 0 57 0 093 mg l 1 respectively though fe leaching concentration under ph 3 was higher than that under ph 6 5 and ph 10 the fe concentration of 0 96 mg l 1 still indicated a low risk of pzbc800u application the reusability of pzbc800u was further explored fig 5d the fresh biochar activated pms degraded 95 of lev within 60 min while the removal efficiency decayed to 63 43 and 28 respectively when the biochar was once twice and thrice reused the decreased catalytic capacity of the used biochar might be attributed to multiple potential reasons first electron transfer and other reactions occurred during the degradation process which changed the surface chemical properties of pzbc800u and reduced its catalytically active sites guo et al 2018 secondly strong oxidizing substances generated in the degradation system attacked the carbon matrix and destroyed the active sites on the biochar saputra et al 2013 besides the degradation intermediates may be adsorbed on the surface of pzbc800u thus blocking the contact of catalytically active sites with the pms wang and wang 2019 all three of the above situations might occur during the reaction the catalytic capacity of the used biochar was largely recovered through thermal regeneration after each cycle fig 5d which indicated that the deposition of degradation intermediates on the catalytically active sites might be one of the main reasons for the decrease in catalytic capacity in addition electron transfer reactions and active sites consumption also contributed to the decreased catalytic capacity of the used biochar which is analyzed and discussed in the next section in order to reduce the regeneration cost and improve the feasibility of practical application the performance of regeneration after 4 times of use was also investigated fig s13 the removal of lev achieved 73 36 within 60 min by the biochar regenerated after 4 uses which indicated the good regeneration performance of the pzbc800u after multiple use in addition an increased biochar dosage could compensate for the decline in the catalytic performance of the biochar after each use under dosage of 0 33 mg l 1 the 3 cycles used biochar achieved a satisfied lev removal of 89 7 while the increased dosage of 0 33 mg l 1 still competitive among the reported catalysts table 1 the performance of pzbc800u pms in real wastewater treatment was also investigated with pzbc800u pms treatment under the same dosage the cod of the pharmaceutical wastewater decreased from 410 1 82 9 mg l 1 to 242 3 13 7 mg l 1 a total of 5 fqs and 2 macrolides mls antibiotics were detected in the wastewater the removal of each antibiotic ranged in 70 4 100 with total removal of fqs and mls reached 99 0 and 100 respectively table 3 the high removal of cod and antibiotics indicated the potential of applying pzbc800u pms in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 3 3 mechanistic insights into pms activation by fexn biochar generation of reactive species usually is one of the main mechanisms in pms activation free radical quenching experiments were conducted to identify the main reactive species produced in the pzbc800u pms system as illustrated in fig 6 the introduction of meoh and tba only achieved slight inhibition on lev degradation thus oh and so4 were not the main reactive species in the degradation while slightly stronger inhibition of tba than meoh on lev degradation 0 028 min 1 vs 0 020 min 1 indicated that there might be a certain number of free radicals existing on the surface of the biochar and the more hydrophilic meoh could not effectively quench them with a higher affinity than meoh dmso showed a higher inhibition of lem degradation which further indicated partial lev was degraded by surface free radicals pei et al 2021 esr characterization was used to further investigate the reactive species generated in the degradation system dmpo a commonly capture agent for oh and so4 could combine with oh and so4 to generate dmpo oh four lines 1 2 2 1 and dmpo so4 six lines 1 1 1 1 1 1 however esr did not detect these two signals but detected seven lines 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 fig 6c which was the product of direct oxidation of dmpo by 1o2 zhu et al 2021 for 1o2 temp can combine with it to generate temp 1o2 which shows a characteristic signal of three lines 1 1 1 in the esr spectrum as shown in fig 6c 1 o2 characteristic peaks were indeed detected by the esr spectrum applying temp the intensity of temp 1o2 increased when the solvent was changed from h2o to d2o fig s14 which was owing to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o than that in h2o wang et al 2020a and thus further confirmed the generation of 1o2 in pzbc800u pms system for verifying the contribution of 1o2 for oxidation ffa a well known quencher of 1o2 cheng et al 2017 was utilized as shown in fig 6a 25 mm ffa significantly inhibited lev degradation to removal of 41 7 from 100 in the control with increased concentration of ffa the inhibition was enhanced and resulted in a lev removal of 31 3 under 50 mm ffa fig s15 although ffa was demonstrated as not only a 1o2 quencher but also a scavenger for oh and so4 the low inhibition of lev degradation by meoh and tba have suggested the low contribution of oh and so4 in the reaction therefore the significant inhibition caused by ffa as well as 1o2 identification based on esr revealed that 1o2 was the dominant ros for lev degradation furthermore the effect of p benzoquinone p bq an effective superoxide radical o2 quencher on lev degradation was evaluated the addition of p bq inhibited lev degradation close to that of ffa as o2 is an important precursor for the formation of 1o2 it could be inferred that most of 1o2 were converted from o2 in addition further testing shows that the contribution of dissolved o2 for o2 and 1o2 generation in this ros system was negligible fig s16 these results revealed that the major oxidant for lev degradation generated from pms by pzbc800u activation was 1o2 in a non radical pathway doping could destroy the electronic charge distribution of the conjugated carbon skeleton in biochar increase defect sites and thus enhance the capacity of pms activation to generate 1o2 zaeni et al 2020 the significantly increased content of pyridinic n and the formed fexn in the biochar should be the root cause for the improvement of catalytic ability of pzbc800u electron transfer mechanism is another potential non radical pathway that is able to activate pms for pollutant degradation yun et al 2018 a positive current was observed when pms was added to the biochars and the current in pzbc800u pms and pzbc800u fe pms were much higher than that in the other two biochar reactions fig 6d it indicated that the active sites on the biochars could immediately react with pms to form reactive species he et al 2021 and the reactivity of fexn rich biochars were much higher than other biochars after lev addition the pzbc800u pms system had an obvious negative current change which suggested the role of electron transfer from lev to pms through pzbc800u electronic impedance spectroscopy eis also revealed the better charge transfer ability of pzbc800u fig s17 the coexistence of pyridinic n and metal n could supply excellent charge transfer performance for materials which was considered to be an efficient catalytic active site feng et al 2020 the fexn in the fe and n doped pzbc800u might be the main reason for its better electron transfer ability the higher current response of pzbc800u fe and the significantly lower response of pzbc800u fe fig 6d supported the important role of fexn in electron transfer of the biochar quantum chemistry calculation based on dft was adopted to further demonstrate the mechanisms the graphene model was used to represent the biochar and fexn was simplified to the fe n model for dft calculation fig s18a it was revealed that the fe n doping extended the positive potential energy range of surface electrostatic potential esp to 150 kcal mol 1 and pyridinic n extended the negative potential energy range of esp to 150 kcal mol 1 compared to the unadulterated biochar in the range of 20 20 kcal mol 1 fig s18b which gave pzbc800u a higher potential for pms activation electron flow analysis indicated that fe n doping made a stronger electron transfer channel between the biochar and pms than the unadulterated and n doping biochars fig 7 which might be due to the chemical adsorption of pms at the fe n sites and the formation of a strong fe o covalent bond bond length was 1 84 å fig s19 in addition the adsorption of pms by fe n in the biochar significantly prolonged the bond length of the o o in pms fig s19 which made pms easier to decompose he et al 2022 the energy gap of the biochar was gradually narrowed with sequential doping of n and fe fig 7d indicated that the pyridinic n and fe n in the biochar could significantly increase the catalytic activity by reducing the energy barrier owing to the small energy gap electrons in the homo 5 796 ev of lev easily transferred to the lumo 2 186 ev of pms through fe and n co doped pzbc800u by forming an electron channel between lev pzbc800u and pms dou et al 2022 xps analysis revealed the consumption of fe n and pyridinic n in the biochar during activating pms for lev degradation fig 8 a which confirmed that fe n and pyridinic n were the main active site in the catalytic reaction comparing the catalytic performance of the biochars fig 4a the endogenous fe doped pzbc800 achieved 78 25 lev removal and the fe removed biochar pzbc800u fe achieved a lev removal of 85 92 by deduction of the adsorption removal from the catalytic reaction group the results indicated the higher performance of n doping on improving the catalytic ability than fe doping in addition the dft calculation shown in fig 7d also indicated that n doping contributes more to the reduction of the energy band gap of the biochar up to 68 0 while further fe doping only achieved a reduction of 25 6 n doping may contribute more to the activation of pms than fe doping nevertheless endogenous fe and exogenous n co doping could achieve a significant improvement in catalytic performance by forming fexn the electron rich oxygen containing functional groups represented by c o was supposed to play an important role in the activation of pms in some condition however the similar content of c o before and after catalytic reaction suggested that c o was not the main active sites for pms activation by pzbc800u fig 8b in addition although zn is a transition metal and may has certain catalytic potential the contribution of zn involved in activating pms is not significant in this study xps and xrd indicated the higher zn content in pzbc800 than that in pzbc800u however the catalytic performance of pzbc800 was much lower than that of pzbc800u besides the peak of zn in xps spectrum of the biochar hardly changed before and after the 3 uses fig s20 in summary fexn formed by endogenous fe and exogenous n doping combined with the pyridinic n played a key role in pms activation for lev degradation the fexn and pyridinic n greatly changed the electronic properties and enhanced the electron transfer ability of the biochar enabling pzbc800u to possess a strong driving force for activating pms to generate 1o2 and act as a mediator of electron transfer from lev to pms thereby improving the degradation of lev 3 4 lev degradation pathways under pms oxidation activated by fexn biochar total organic carbon toc analysis showed that the removal of toc was much lower than the removal of lev fig s21a which indicated the existence of degradation intermediates a total of 18 intermediates were identified by lc tof ms analysis table s8 six possible degradation pathways of lev including demethylation hydroxylation piperazine ring opening carboxylation de carboxylation oxidation of quinolone rings and defluorination were proposed fig 9 a in pathway i r1 was generated by replacing the methyl on piperazinyl ring with a hydroxyl group and then the fluorine in r1 was substituted with a hydroxyl converting to r2 under the attack of oh zhong et al 2021 in pathway ii demethylation might be the first step then r3 was formed owing to cleavage of piperazine ring piperazine residues were further attacked by active species and gradually generated r6 via r4 and r5 in pathway iii piperazine ring was cleaved prior to demethylation forming r7 and the carbonyl group and single bond ch3 were further removed generating r8 and r9 in pathway iv r10 was generated through decarboxylation which was further degraded to r11 and r12 in pathway v r13 was formed by oxidation of quinolone rings and replacement of the fluorine by a hydroxyl and then quinolone residues were further degraded generating r16 via r14 and r15 by the attack of 1o2 lyu et al 2020 in pathway vi r17 was generated through piperazine ring cleavage and defluorination and then converted to r18 through shedding piperazinyl residues and demethylation of the quinolone ring based on evaluation by t e s t toxicity of r1 was slightly higher than that of lev and all other intermediates possess a much lower toxicity compared to lev table s8 it could be inferred that the toxicity of lev was effectively reduced after pms oxidation activated by pzbc800u it was worth noting that 11 of the 18 degradation intermediates were generated by destroying the piperazine ring this might be due to the breaking of the piperazine ring was easier than that of quinolone ring and the c f bond during the degradation process to further confirm alie analysis was used to evaluate the electrophilic points of the lev molecule since the electron binding ability is relatively weak near low alie position electrophilic reactions and free radical reactions are more likely to occur at the position with the lowest alie value deng et al 2019 in the pzbc800u pms system 1o2 is the main oxidation species and its π2p orbital is an unoccupied orbital which has strong electrophilic activity and thus tends to attack areas where electrons are concentrated yin et al 2019 the proposed degradation pathways were well fit with the four relatively low alie areas on the lev molecule fig 9b the piperazine ring and its connected methyl possess the smallest alie 8 51 8 96 and 7 49 ev demonstrating that 1o2 and free radicals were more likely to attack this area which resulted in the preferential degradation of piperazine ring and demethylation in the pms oxidation system activated by pzbc800u alie in the area around the fluorine on the quinolone ring was relatively low but still much higher than that of piperazine ring area therefore though defluorinated intermediates were detected defluorination was not the main pathway for lev degradation which was confirmed by the low defluorination rate 9 57 revealed by measuring the detached fluorine fig s21b since the electron rich piperazine ring of lev is more attractive for 1o2 oxidation while defluorination of lev is mainly based on attacking c f by hydroxyl radical zhong et al 2021 the breakage of the piperazine ring would be the primary way of lev degradation in pzbc800 pms which was mainly via non radical pathways conclusions in this study fexn biochar pzbc800u was successfully derived from endogenous fe oh 3 contained pharmaceutical sludge with exogenous n doping pzbc800u could effectively activate pms for lev degradation in a wide ph range the main mechanism of pms activation by pzbc800u for lev degradation was the non radical pathways including the generation of 1o2 and electron transfer the formation of fe n synergized with pyridinic n greatly disturbed the uniform electronic distribution and improved the electron transfer capability of biochar resulting in the strong pms activation ability of pzbc800u for lev degradation demethylation hydroxylation piperazine ring opening carboxylation de carboxylation oxidation of quinolone rings and defluorination were the detected lev degradation pathways in which piperazine ring opening and demethylation were the priority steps owing to the low alie this study provides a new insight into fe n biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent performance of pms activation for lev degradation credit authorship contribution statement qinyue

on request 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used in aquaculture and animal husbandry to achieve high growth and production chen et al 2020 which are usually overdosed to exceed the standards li et al 2021 and not effectively metabolized nallaiah et al 2022 thus high concentration antibiotics are detected in wastewater of breeding industry residual antibiotics can develop bacterial resistance and harm human health by accumulating through the food chain gao et al 2012 thiang et al 2021 their residues have been found in animal tissues intended for human consumption romero soto et al 2018 in order to reduce the route of veterinary antibiotics into the natural environment from the source antibiotics treatment technology that is easy to construct and regulate in situ is an important trend of degradation in the future electro oxidation that consists of only anode cathode and external power supply lv et al 2021 wang et al 2021a can be operated in compact mobile units and does not require chemical addition liang et al 2018 is a clean and efficient technology to remove antibiotics jara et al 2007 zheng et al 2019 organic molecules are oxidized on the electrode surface or by oh to achieve the purpose of removal du et al 2021 the velocity of pollutants reaching the reaction site is the key to affecting the degradation efficiency which indicates the oxidation rate is mainly controlled by mass transfer lang et al 2020 regarding mass transfer various porous cathodes designed with the intention of improving the removal of pollutants by increasing molecular diffusion have been recently reported li et al 2020a liu et al 2020 su et al 2021 in these cases the oxygen utilization efficiency oh production and pollutants removal are significantly increased generally flow configuration has attracted the most attention in mass transfer studies chai et al 2021 li et al 2020c poza nogueiras et al 2022 ren et al 2019b wang et al 2021b the flow through configuration can improve electrochemical kinetics and efficiency and promote electron transfer through convective mass transfer on the electrode surface gao et al 2015 compared to the conventional batch electrochemical system the current density of the filtration system 6 1 ma cm 2 was increased by 5 3 times liu and vecitis 2012 and the pollutant degradation kinetics was increased by 5 1 times guo et al 2021 the pollutant removal in the flow through electro fenton was also 41 8 ma et al 2016 the removal to methylene blue 50 mg l 1 increased from 64 9 to 92 0 and 49 7 ren et al 2019a the removal to sulfadiazines 10 mg l 1 increased from 66 8 to 100 higher than that of flow by system respectively except for more catalytic sites and faster oxygen transport the increasing instantaneous concentration of reactants on the cathode surface due to the enforced liquid convection is also the reason for the better performance in the flow through electro oxidation reactor wang et al 2021b concerning the enrichment of reactants the membrane physical interception is the simple and efficient method in which influent reactants are intercepted in the reactor and clean effluent passes through the membrane hu et al 2021b yang et al 2019 the inner three dimensional porous structure of the membrane can provide more reactive sites for electrochemical reactions reduce boundary layer thickness and accelerate mass transfer yang et al 2020 lin et al lin et al 2021 utilized a reactive electrochemical membrane to treating of landfill leachate which achieved total organic carbon removal of 76 and greatly reduced energy consumption to 3 6 kw h m 3 several studies suggested that membrane enhanced electro fenton reaction rate jiang et al 2020 trellu et al 2020 keller et al keller et al 2021 synthesized glucose from cellobiose in electro fenton and improved the selectivity of glucose with nanofiltration close to the theoretical value the tio2 electrochemical membrane increased the removal of total organic carbon from 31 standalone electro fenton to 67 trellu et al 2020 the polyvinylidene fluoride stainless steel polypyrrole cathode membrane increased the removal of phenol 4 0 mg l 1 from 54 7 to 79 3 in filter electro fenton and the rejection rate was 7 95 li et al 2020b however in these so called electro filtration systems the membrane interception effect is not fully reflected and the rejection rate is not high in this work a novel flow through electro filtration system was constructed with a membrane like filtration air cathode the membrane like cathode possessed dual functions including membrane interception and electro oxidation electrode and was prepared by simple phase inversion method and modified by polyaniline which showed good rejection rate and electrochemical degradation efficiency on treating of antibiotics the morphology conductivity water flux pollutant removal and anti fouling performance and the tetracycline tc removal in the river water background were also investigated the removal quantity and energy consumption were evaluated and lower than the literatures the membrane like filtration air cathode of this study provided a promising integrated mode for electrooxidation and membrane filtration coupling processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinyl chloride pvc molecular weight 1650 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp

mixed at four different mass rations pani cb of 0 control 0 125 pani1 8 0 25 pani1 4 and 0 5 pani1 2 2 3 flow through electro filtration reactor construction and operation the circular flow through reactor was constructed with the anode of dimensionally stable anodes dsa ti ruo2 iro2 and the filtration air cathode fig s1 the effective reactor volume and electrode area were 5 6 ml and 7 0 cm2 the distance between the anode and cathode was 0 8 cm the influent volume circular flow rate and the air flow rate were 70 0 ml 45 0 ml min 1 and 50 0 ml min 1 respectively the external electric field was provided by a direct current power and the current was 10 0 ma 1 4 ma cm 2 the reaction period was 3 0 h including 1 5 h membrane interception no electric field and 1 5 h membrane interception electrochemical removal there were two types of the influent including simulated wastewater 50 mm na2so4 tc ph 3 0 and actual water as the background 2 4 analysis and calculation the surface morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem su8010 japan hitachi the porosity was measured by the gravimetric method and calculated by the following formula song et al 2018b 1 ε δ

tc content was investigated by an enzyme standard instrument epoch biotek america at wavelength 357 nm which included the rejected tc and the final effluent tc the rejection rate was calculated using the following formula 3 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where r is the rejection rate c0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration ct mg l 1 is the final concentration the durability of the filtration air cathode was analyzed by tc removal after 15 periods the cathode was washed using deionized water for 10 mins after each period the concentration of h2o2 production was measured using standard methods by enzyme standard instrument epoch biotek instruments inc america the oh was analyzed by an electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx nano bruker with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the capture agent the removal performance at the actual water background was investigated using river hongni river tianjin china the total chemical oxygen demand tcod was tested by the hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer hach co loveland co usa using the standard method in order to study the effect of pani on the decomposition of h2o2 10 mm pani was added to the h2o2 solution with a series of concentrations and the h2o2 concentration of the standard sample and pani standard sample was determined after 30 mins of stabilization it also investigated the tc removal by oh generated in process of pani catalyzed h2o2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of filtration air cathode sem images showed that the polymer filter layer was formed on the pani1 4 and pani1 2 fig 1 a there was no obvious filter layer on the control and pani1 8 surface and carbon particles were exposed which indicated that pani promoted the formation of filter layer on the electrode surface when the addition amount increased to 25 cb the porosity and water flux was increased after adding pani fig 1b the maximum porosity was obtained in pani1 4 87 8 0 1 which was 39 1 12 4 and 14 0 higher than that of the control 63 1 0 7 pani1 8 78 1 1 0 and pani1 2 77 0 0 1 the water flux of pani1 4 97 4 0 3 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 was 44 3 19 7 and 14 3 higher than that of the control 67 5 0 7 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 pani1 8 81 4 0 7 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 and pani1 2 85 2 1 0 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 the sem images showed that the polymer layer was formed on the surface of pani1 4 and pani1 2 which indicated that pani promoted the crosslinking of polymers the pores between carbon particles were replaced by polymer and led to the decrease of porosity which indirectly affected the water flux because the abundant pores could provide instantaneous high flow quantity jiang et al 2022 the contact angle was decreased after adding pani fig 1c the contact angle of pani1 2 was 56 7 1 9 which was 52 8 40 8 and 23 8 lower than that of the control 120 0 3 9 pani1 8 95 8 5 2 and pani1 4 74 4 3 9 the lower contact angle the stronger hydrophilicity the hydrophilic nh2 group could bond with water molecules huang et al 2017 and improve the hydrophilicity of the modified electrodes nawaz et al 2021 the contact angle decreased from 90 to 70 stronger hydrophilicity could improve the anti fouling performance of the electrodes hu et al 2021a the contact angle decreased from 73 55 to 47 53 the flux recovery rate increased from 67 4 to 79 8 the conductivity of the modified electrode was higher than that of the control fig 1c the conductivity of pani1 2 was 25 7 0 5 ms cm 1 which was 94 7 higher than that of the control 13 2 0 5 ms cm 1 61 6 and 5 3 higher than pani1 8 15 9 0 4 ms cm 1 and pani1 4 24 4 0 5 ms cm 1 respectively higher conductivity could enhance the electrical response and electronegativity of the electrode under the external electric field thus increasing the anti fouling ability song et al 2018a 3 2 tc removal the filtration electrode showed good performance in pollutant removal fig 2 a at tc 50 mg l 1 the maximum final tc removal was obtained in pani1 4 92 9 0 1 which was 31 4 higher than that of the control 70 7 0 2 and slightly higher than that of pani1 8 88 4 0 3 and pani1 2 89 5 0 2 the rejection rate of pani1 4 was 71 1 0 5 which was 35 9 and 26 1 higher than that of the control 52 3 0 4 and pani1 8 56 4 0 4 and similar with pani1 2 71 5 0 5 pani1 4 and pani1 2 possessed filter layer which improved the rejection performance the final tc removal and rejection rate of the background carbon felt was 31 6 0 3 and 8 7 0 2 which indicated that the electrode layer provided most of the removal the contribution of the background carbon felt in the final tc removal and rejection rate was 44 5 and 16 4 to the control 35 6 and 15 2 to pani1 8 33 8 and 12 0 to pani1 4 35 1 and 12 0 to pani1 2 the tc removal of pani1 4 at one stage operation electro interception was investigated fig 2b the tc removal 77 8 2 5 of pani1 4 at 90 min was 9 4 higher than that at the two stage operation and the final tc removal 89 0 0 7 was slightly lower than that at the two stage operation this result indicated that the operation mode of two stage operation was beneficial to the removal of pollutants because tc was concentrated by the filtration electrode in the first 90 min and the instantaneous concentration of tc in the electrochemical degradation was higher some were in the solution inside the reactor some were attached to the electrode surface which increased the reaction site in addition the two stage operation mode was more energy saving than the one stage operation the h2o2 production and oh at 3 0 h electro degradation 1 5 h were investigated fig s2 the background carbon felt generated 59 2 0 7 μm l 1 h2o2 pani1 4 possessed maximum h2o2 production 105 2 0 7 μm l 1 which was 25 7 and 15 5 higher than that of the control 83 7 1 6 μm l 1 and pani1 8 91 1 2 2 μm l 1 and slightly higher than that of pani1 2 98 0 1 3 μm l 1 remove the background value the h2o2 production was 24 5 0 9 μm l 1 to the control 32 0 1 5 μm l 1 to pani1 8 46 1 0 1 μm l 1 to pani1 4 47 1 0 6 μm l 1 pani1 2 which indicated that pani improved the electro synthesis of h2o2 the epr curves of the filtration air cathode presented the typical peak for the dmpo oh adduct appears as 1 2 2 1 quartet the modified electrode exhibited higher intensity than that of the control the background carbon felt also exhibited weak intensity of the typical peak suggesting that the electro oxidation of the dsa anode was present oturan et al 2021 and the dsa anode provided a part of oh for treating of tc the typical intensity of the modified electrodes was higher than that of the control suggesting that pani promoted the conversion of h2o2 to oh as shown in fig s2c the modified electrodes possessed better electrochemical performance at 0 1 v the current density of pani1 4 was 13 7 a m 2 which was 57 5 21 2 and 29 2 higher than that of the control 8 7 a m 2 pani1 8 11 3 a m 2 and pani1 2 10 6 a m 2 which indicated that pani improved the electrocatalytic activity of the filtration electrodes the current density of pani1 2 was lower than that of pani1 4 which was due to the excessive hydrophilicity of pani1 2 leading to the phenomenon of water flooding these results showed that the modified electrodes possessed higher tc removal and rejection rate which was related to the physicochemical properties as shown in fig s3 porosity conductivity and current density were positively correlated with the final tc removal except for the tc removal of pani1 2 the higher porosity and conductivity the higher tc removal the higher porosity provided more oxygen reduction site and improved o2 transfer yu et al 2016 the higher conductivity provided a stronger electric response the higher electrochemical activity provided higher electric removal the sem images of pani1 4 and pani1 2 showed a polymer layer which provided a denser surface and improved interception performance pani1 2 was more hydrophilic and prone to flooding which was not conducive to the formation of a three phase interface it also possessed lower porosity when the pollutants passed through the electrode they would block the internal channels leading to the reduction of electrochemical reaction sites therefore even though its conductivity was the highest the tc removal was still lower than pani1 4 3 3 anti fouling performance the physicochemical properties after tc degradation were investigated to characterize the anti fouling performance fig 3 after treating of the simulated wastewater the pollutants were attracted on the surface of the used membrane electrode and the modified electrode exhibited cleaner surface after degradation the porosity of the control 54 8 0 1 was decreased by 13 1 the porosity of pani1 8 71 1 0 1 pani1 4 84 3 0 1 pani1 2 72 7 0 2 was slightly lower than that of the clean electrodes the pure water flux of the used electrode was slightly decreased the flux after using the control was 61 5 0 8 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 that of pani1 8 was 79 7 1 9 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 that of pani1 4 was 95 4 3 2 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 and that of pani1 2 82 3 1 7 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 the flux recovery rate was more than 90 91 1 for control 97 9 for pani1 8 97 9 for pani1 4 96 5 for pani1 2 the attenuation of conductivity was 8 1 for the control 6 0 for pani1 8 4 4 for pani1 4 and 7 8 for pani1 2 these results indicated that the filtration electrode possessed good anti fouling and pani improved the anti fouling performance of the filtration electrodes the rejection rate and flux recovery were investigated using 100 mg l 1 bsa fig s4 pani1 4 exhibited the highest rejection rate 63 3 1 3 which was 52 5 higher than that of the control 41 5 1 6 18 8 and 9 9 higher than that of pani1 8 53 3 1 9 and pani1 2 57 6 0 9 the flux recovery of the control pani1 8 pani1 4 and pani1 2 was 91 5 5 8 95 9 3 1 96 7 2 5 and 91 2 3 9 the modified electrodes exhibited a cleaner surface lower porosity attenuation and higher flux recovery which indicated that pani improved the anti fouling performance of the filtration cathodes the rejection rate of pani1 2 to bsa was second only to pani1 4 and the flux recovery rate was lower than pani1 8 and pani1 4 which was because a dense polymer layer was formed on the surface bsa was attached to the pores of pani1 2 and led to a decrease in filtration aperture and an increase in rejection rate the flux recovery of pani1 8 was second only to pani1 4 and the rejection rate was lower than pani1 4 and pani1 2 which was because the pore size formed on the surface of pani1 8 was larger than pani1 4 and pani1 2 although pollutants adhered to the pores but did not affect permeability 3 4 durability combined with sem images porosity and flux of the clean and used electrodes and bsa test data pani1 4 achieved the best overall performance the durability of pani1 4 at simulated wastewater was investigated fig 4 after 15 cycles 45 h the final tc removal was still higher than 80 the final tc removal was decreased by 4 3 and the rejection rate was slightly increased the contribution of electrochemical degradation in tc removal was decreased and the contribution of interception was increased a small amount of tc was attached to the surface or the internal pores of pani1 4 which reduced the electrochemical reaction sites and the degradation efficiency but the reduced membrane pores provided higher precision interception and improved the rejection rate the water flux and final tc removal were fitted according to the fitting equation at 250 and 1800 periods the attenuation of the water flux was 20 and 30 at 124 and 188 periods the attenuation of the final tc removal was 20 and 30 the minimum service life of pani1 4 was 124 periods 372 h 15 5 d 3 5 natural water background according to the specification for the application of tetracyclines in aquaculture of china sc t 1085 2006 this kind of drug needed to be taken in a medicinal bath or fed with bait therefore the removal of two concentrations 50 and 0 5 mg l 1 in the freshwater background was investigated fig 5 the original ph tcod fe2 and tfe of the river was 8 0 0 1 134 3 2 1 mg l 1 zero and zero at original ph and 3 0 tc 50 mg l 1 the final tc removal was 84 2 0 7 and 86 7 0 4 the rejection rate to tc was 44 9 1 4 and 48 6 1 3 the tcod removal was 88 2 0 7 and 90 7 0 4 the effluent tcod was 22 0 1 6 mg l 1 and 17 3 1 9 mg l 1 respectively at original ph and 3 0 tc 0 5 mg l 1 the final tc removal and rejection rate was almost 100 the tcod removal was 91 1 1 1 and 91 9 0 5 the effluent tcod was 12 0 1 6 mg l 1 and 11 0 0 8 mg l 1 respectively the tc and tcod removal at original ph was similar to that at ph 3 0 and the effluent tcod was lower than 25 mg l 1 which reached the second level standard of freshwater pond aquaculture water discharge requirements of china sc t 9101 2007 in addition literature reported that after 90 min electrochemical degradation the escherichia coli inhibition zone diameter was decreased from 14 0 to 11 0 mm xin et al 2022 and toxicity of the by products to marine bacteria was decreased after treating of electro fenton and anodic oxidation for 30 min zwane et al 2021 the electrochemical degradation process of this electro filtration system was as long as 90 min and the toxicity of the by products would be reduced at the same time the interception process would block some by products and reduce their concentration in the effluent when the residual concentration was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 the membrane like cathode would intercept the pollutant even without electrochemical degradation process and not produce by products therefore this electro filtration no need to adjust ph and adding agents was suitable for treating of freshwater aquaculture wastewater 3 6 mechanisms in the process of tc removal there were two removal processes including interception and electrochemical degradation fig 6 electrochemical oxidation as a chemical process provided oh to attack pollutants enriched by interception as shown in fig s5a the measured h2o2 concentration of the standard sample was higher than that of the pani sample at target h2o2 1 0 10 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 the measured h2o2 concentration of the pani sample was 2 6 19 7 24 9 75 5 and 77 8 lower than that of the standard sample at standard h2o2 10 and 25 mg l 1 the epr curves showed obvious oh peak after adding pani fig s5b this suggested that pani could catalyze h2o2 probably due to its fenton like activity wang et al 2019 as well as the nitrogen doped carbon materials could be used as catalysts to promote the conversion of h2o2 to oh huang and zhang 2021 so we hypothesized that the nh2 group catalyzed the h2o2 this result was consistent with the oh peak strength in epr curves the peak strength of the modified electrode was stronger than that of the control and carbon felt the tc degradation was also investigated fig s5c the tc removal of 0 5 mm fe2 was much higher than that of pani powder which was because that pani was insoluble in water and had fewer catalytic sites for h2o2 in the liquid phase but the cathode surface presented hydrophilicity due to nh2 group of pani which increased the reaction site of the liquid phase and showed higher catalytic performance than pani powder except the cathodic oh dsa also provided oh the interception and final removal amount of the background carbon felt 0 30 and 1 1 mg was much lower than that of influent tc 3 5 mg which indicated that the tc intercepted by background carbon felt reached and was at the limit the decrease of tc concentration from 90 to 180 min was due to electrochemical oxidation process therefore the amount and removal of tc removed by oh generated by dsa was 0 80 mg and 23 1 and its contribution in the final tc removal was 32 4 to the control 25 9 to pani1 8 24 6 to pani1 4 and 25 6 to pani1 2 therefore the pollutants degradation process should be as follows when the pollutants entered the reactor they were attacked by oh generated by dsa the final tc removal and rejection rate of the background carbon felt was 31 6 0 3 and 8 7 0 2 so the electrochemical removal was about 22 9 and the adsorption to tc by carbon felt was 8 7 0 2 in this process since the adsorption of carbon felt was much lower than the residual amount and the final removal was less than 50 indicating that the pollutants on the carbon felt were in the adsorption saturation state until the end of the degradation reaction therefore the electrochemical removal provided by the oh generated by dsa anode was 22 9 so the removal contribution of dsa was 24 7 the final tc removal of pani1 4 was 92 9 0 1 then the pollutants reached the cathode part of the pollutants was intercepted in the solution inside the reactor by the filter layer increasing the instantaneous concentration and part of the pollutants adhered to the filter layer carbon layer and carbon felt which as the pollutants were intercepted inside the reactor and on the cathode and further removed by oh generated by the cathode the interception of pollutants by the cathode was a dynamic process the oh generated by cathode attacked the pollutants in the solution inside the reactor and on the cathode without any difference the electrochemical degradation and interception of pollutants on the cathode existed simultaneously the reaction sites occupied by the interception of pollutants were vacated by electrochemical degradation and again occupied by the interception of pollutants and the cycle repeated thus the removal contribution of the cathode was about 75 including interception and electro oxidation in the end unoxidized and intercepted pollutants remained in the effluent according to fig 2 the removal of interception followed by interception electro oxidation was slightly higher than that of interception electro oxidation interception not only reduced the effluent pollutants concentration but also enriched pollutants to improve the efficiency of electro oxidation the improvement of pollutant removal of the filtration cathode was also related to its conductivity the conductivity of the filtration electrode was increased after adding pani which could improve the electron transfer rate and electrons reached into the cathodic reaction site faster under the constant current the electric charge supply per unit time was fixed the higher conductivity indicated that the amount of charge used for heat release was reduced and more electrons became available to participate in the cathodic reaction rather than being consumed in conduction therefore the reasons for the greatly increased pollutant removal of the modified electrode included the interception of the surface filter layer the catalysis of pani to h2o2 and the faster electron transfer 3 7 comparative analysis the water flux flux recovery removal performance and energy consumption of pani1 4 was compared with other electro filtration electrodes as shown in table 1 the water flux the physical property of the material of pani1 4 was much higher than that of the reported jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020b li et al 2020c sun et al 2020 xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 which indicated that pani1 4 possessed good permeability and high hydraulic shock load the water flux recovery of pani1 4 after filtering the pollutants jiang et al 2018 xu et al 2022 and bsa solution sun et al 2020 was also much higher than that of the literatures which indicated that pani1 4 had a strong anti fouling performance in the simulated water background the removal of pani1 4 was slightly lower than that in literatures jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020c xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 which was because of the original pollutant 50 mg l 1 was higher than that in literatures 17 8 mg l 1 and exhibited stronger oh competition to decrease the removal but the removal quantity of pani1 4 was much higher than that of the literatures jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020b li et al 2020c sun et al 2020 xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 compared with the literatures the removal quantity of pani1 4 was 31 3 li et al 2020c 8 3 times jiang et al 2020 28 2 times li et al 2020b 68 5 ye et al 2022 61 0 times jiang et al 2018 3 08 times xu et al 2022 and 1 58 times sun et al 2020 higher than that of the reported which indicated that the electro filtration reactor with pani1 4 possessed high treatment capacity at acidic ph condition the pollutant removal of the reported li et al 2020b was the lowest which consisted of the low current density 0 8 ma cm 2 compared with reaction condition of pani1 4 the literatures with higher pollutant removal had stable h2o2 supply li et al 2020c and high current density jiang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 and when the target pollutant concentration decreased the removal of pani1 4 was 100 even in the complex natural water background which indicated the acidic ph condition was not the absolute condition for obtaining high removal rate in addition to the assistance of acidic conditions the high removal rate under simulated background was ensured by its own interception performance and the electro oxidation efficiency of the system the rejection rate to the target pollutant of pani1 4 was 1 75 times jiang et al 2020 7 98 times li et al 2020b 1 64 times jiang et al 2018 34 7 xu et al 2022 higher than that of the reported which also provided high instantaneous concentration for the electro oxidation process although the treatment time was up to 3 0 h but the electrochemical degradation process was only 1 5 h which reduced the power consumption 1 5 h of interception and 1 5 h of interception electro oxidation and showed a lower energy consumption 8 57 kw h kg 1 which was also 54 4 li et al 2020c 27 1 jiang et al 2020 92 3 jiang et al 2018 and 85 6 xu et al 2022 lower than that of the reported power consumption process over the period 3 8 limitations this system possessed high removal and low energy consumption but also possessed limitations such as membrane fouling and need for power supply the common issue of electro oxidation system increasing hydrophilicity could improve anti fouling performance but excessive hydrophilicity would lead to flooding which was not conducive to cathodic reaction so it needed to be kept within a certain range and in practical application the reactor power supply and pump three functional units were separated which was not conducive to carrying and the module integration was needed in addition from the perspective of long term operation the accumulation of power consumption was high and the power source needed to be optimized such as solar energy 4 conclusions the filtration electrodes modified by pani were prepared using a phase inversion method to enhance the performance of the electro filtration reactor and provide a filtered effluent after adding pani the porosity hydrophilicity conductivity and rejection of the filtration electrodes were significantly increased pani1 4 exhibited better overall performance which had 71 1 rejection rate and 92 9 final tc removal at river water background the final tc removal was 84 2 to 50 mg l 1 and 100 to 0 5 mg l 1 at original ph it also possessed good anti fouling performance the final tc removal was decreased by 4 3 after 15 cycles the reduction of porosity was lower than 10 0 the flux recovery rate after filtration of tc and bsa was higher than 90 0 mechanism analysis showed that pani improved the removal performance by interception of the filter layer the catalysis to h2o2 and faster electron transfer this filtration electrode possessed good interception and autocatalyzing h2o2 and showed high treatment quantity and low energy consumption the dual functional membrane like cathode not a simple superposition of technical units provided a new idea for the coupling of electro oxidation and membrane and the interception also provided an energy saving application of electro oxidation

15504,the membrane like air cathodes modified with different polyaniline were prepared using phase inversion method which possessed dual functions of interception and electrochemical degradation and showed good conductivity 15 9 0 4 to 25 7 0 5 ms cm 1 and porosity 77 0 0 1 to 87 8 0 1 compared to the unmodified control one 13 2 0 5 ms cm 1 and 63 1 0 7 at tetracycline 50 mg l 1 the cathode with

background was near 100 and the chemical oxygen demand removal was 91 9 supporting that it was suitable for treating antibiotics in natural water without adding agents but only for electricity consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electro filtration filtration air cathode tetracycline removal anti fouling flow through data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used in aquaculture and animal husbandry to achieve high growth and production chen et al 2020 which are usually overdosed to exceed the standards li et al 2021 and not effectively metabolized nallaiah et al 2022 thus high concentration antibiotics are detected in wastewater of breeding industry residual antibiotics can develop bacterial resistance and harm human health by accumulating through the food chain gao et al 2012 thiang et al 2021 their residues have been found in animal tissues intended for human consumption romero soto et al 2018 in order to reduce the route of veterinary antibiotics into the natural environment from the source antibiotics treatment technology that is easy to construct and regulate in situ is an important trend of degradation in the future electro oxidation that consists of only anode cathode and external power supply lv et al 2021 wang et al 2021a can be operated in compact mobile units and does not require chemical addition liang et al 2018 is a clean and efficient technology to remove antibiotics jara et al 2007 zheng et al 2019 organic molecules are oxidized on the electrode surface or by oh to achieve the purpose of removal du et al 2021 the velocity of pollutants reaching the reaction site is the key to affecting the degradation efficiency which indicates the oxidation rate is mainly controlled by mass transfer lang et al 2020 regarding mass transfer various porous cathodes designed with the intention of improving the removal of pollutants by increasing molecular diffusion have been recently reported li et al 2020a liu et al 2020 su et al 2021 in these cases the oxygen utilization efficiency oh production and pollutants removal are significantly increased generally flow configuration has attracted the most attention in mass transfer studies chai et al 2021 li et al 2020c poza nogueiras et al 2022 ren et al 2019b wang et al 2021b the flow through configuration can improve electrochemical kinetics and efficiency and promote electron transfer through convective mass transfer on the electrode surface gao et al 2015 compared to the conventional batch electrochemical system the current density of the filtration system 6 1 ma cm 2 was increased by 5 3 times liu and vecitis 2012 and the pollutant degradation kinetics was increased by 5 1 times guo et al 2021 the pollutant removal in the flow through electro fenton was also 41 8 ma et al 2016 the removal to methylene blue 50 mg l 1 increased from 64 9 to 92 0 and 49 7 ren et al 2019a the removal to sulfadiazines 10 mg l 1 increased from 66 8 to 100 higher than that of flow by system respectively except for more catalytic sites and faster oxygen transport the increasing instantaneous concentration of reactants on the cathode surface due to the enforced liquid convection is also the reason for the better performance in the flow through electro oxidation reactor wang et al 2021b concerning the enrichment of reactants the membrane physical interception is the simple and efficient method in which influent reactants are intercepted in the reactor and clean effluent passes through the membrane hu et al 2021b yang et al 2019 the inner three dimensional porous structure of the membrane can provide more reactive sites for electrochemical reactions reduce boundary layer thickness and accelerate mass transfer yang et al 2020 lin et al lin et al 2021 utilized a reactive electrochemical membrane to treating of landfill leachate which achieved total organic carbon removal of 76 and greatly reduced energy consumption to 3 6 kw h m 3 several studies suggested that membrane enhanced electro fenton reaction rate jiang et al 2020 trellu et al 2020 keller et al keller et al 2021 synthesized glucose from cellobiose in electro fenton and improved the selectivity of glucose with nanofiltration close to the theoretical value the tio2 electrochemical membrane increased the removal of total organic carbon from 31 standalone electro fenton to 67 trellu et al 2020 the polyvinylidene fluoride stainless steel polypyrrole cathode membrane increased the removal of phenol 4 0 mg l 1 from 54 7 to 79 3 in filter electro fenton and the rejection rate was 7 95 li et al 2020b however in these so called electro filtration systems the membrane interception effect is not fully reflected and the rejection rate is not high in this work a novel flow through electro filtration system was constructed with a membrane like filtration air cathode the membrane like cathode possessed dual functions including membrane interception and electro oxidation electrode and was prepared by simple phase inversion method and modified by polyaniline which showed good rejection rate and electrochemical degradation efficiency on treating of antibiotics the morphology conductivity water flux pollutant removal and anti fouling performance and the tetracycline tc removal in the river water background were also investigated the removal quantity and energy consumption were evaluated and lower than the literatures the membrane like filtration air cathode of this study provided a

provided by a direct current power and the current was 10 0 ma 1 4 ma cm 2 the reaction period was 3 0 h including 1 5 h membrane interception no electric field and 1 5 h membrane interception electrochemical removal there were two types of the influent including simulated wastewater 50 mm na2so4 tc ph 3 0 and actual water as the background 2 4 analysis and calculation the surface

standard instrument epoch biotek instruments inc america the oh was analyzed by an electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx nano bruker with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the capture agent the removal performance at the actual water background was investigated using river hongni river tianjin china the total chemical oxygen demand tcod was tested by the hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer hach co loveland co usa using the standard method in order to study the effect of pani on the decomposition of h2o2 10 mm pani was added to the h2o2 solution with a series of concentrations and the h2o2 concentration of the standard sample and pani standard sample was determined after 30 mins of stabilization it also investigated the tc removal by oh generated in process of pani catalyzed h2o2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of filtration air cathode sem images showed that the polymer filter layer was formed on the pani1 4 and pani1 2 fig 1 a there was no obvious filter layer on the control and pani1 8 surface and carbon particles were exposed which indicated that pani promoted the formation of filter layer on the electrode surface when the addition amount increased to 25 cb the porosity and water flux was increased after adding pani fig 1b the maximum porosity was obtained in pani1 4 87 8 0 1 which was 39 1 12 4 and 14 0 higher than that of the control 63 1 0 7 pani1 8 78 1 1 0 and pani1 2 77 0 0 1 the water flux of pani1 4 97 4 0 3 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 was 44 3 19 7 and 14 3 higher than that of the control 67 5 0 7 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 pani1 8 81 4 0 7 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 and pani1 2 85 2 1 0 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 the sem images showed that the polymer layer was formed on the surface of pani1 4 and pani1 2 which indicated that pani promoted the crosslinking of polymers the pores between carbon particles were replaced by polymer and led to the decrease of porosity which indirectly affected the water flux because the abundant pores could provide instantaneous high flow quantity jiang et al 2022 the contact angle was decreased after adding pani fig 1c the contact angle of pani1 2 was 56 7 1 9 which was 52 8 40 8 and 23 8 lower than that of the control 120 0 3 9 pani1 8 95 8 5 2 and pani1 4 74 4 3 9 the lower contact angle the stronger hydrophilicity the hydrophilic nh2 group could bond with water molecules huang et al 2017 and improve the hydrophilicity of the modified electrodes nawaz et al 2021 the contact angle decreased from 90 to 70 stronger hydrophilicity could improve the anti fouling performance of the electrodes hu et al 2021a the contact angle decreased from 73 55 to 47 53 the flux recovery rate increased from 67 4 to 79 8 the conductivity of the modified electrode was higher than that of the control fig 1c the conductivity of pani1 2 was 25 7 0 5 ms cm 1 which was 94 7 higher than that of the control 13 2 0 5 ms cm 1 61 6 and 5 3 higher than pani1 8 15 9 0 4 ms cm 1 and pani1 4 24 4 0 5 ms cm 1 respectively higher conductivity could enhance the electrical response and electronegativity of the electrode under the external electric field thus increasing the anti fouling ability song et al 2018a 3 2 tc removal the filtration electrode showed good performance in pollutant removal fig 2 a at tc 50 mg l 1 the maximum final tc removal was obtained in pani1 4 92 9 0 1 which was 31 4 higher than that of the control 70 7 0 2 and slightly higher than that of pani1 8 88 4 0 3 and pani1 2 89 5 0 2 the rejection rate of pani1 4 was 71 1 0 5 which was 35 9 and 26 1 higher than that of the control 52 3 0 4 and pani1 8 56 4 0 4 and similar with pani1 2 71 5 0 5 pani1 4 and pani1 2 possessed filter layer which improved the rejection performance the final tc removal and rejection rate of the background carbon felt was 31 6 0 3 and 8 7 0 2 which indicated that the electrode layer provided most of the removal the contribution of the background carbon felt in the final tc removal and rejection rate was 44 5 and 16 4 to the control 35 6 and 15 2 to pani1 8 33 8 and 12 0 to pani1 4 35 1 and 12 0 to pani1 2 the tc removal of pani1 4 at one stage operation electro interception was investigated fig 2b the tc removal 77 8 2 5 of pani1 4 at 90 min was 9 4 higher than that at the two stage operation and the final tc removal 89 0 0 7 was slightly lower than that at the two stage operation this result indicated that the operation mode of two stage operation was beneficial to the removal of pollutants because tc was concentrated by the filtration electrode in the first 90 min and the instantaneous concentration of tc in the electrochemical degradation was higher some were in the solution inside the reactor some were attached to the electrode surface which increased the reaction site in addition the two stage operation mode was more energy saving than the one stage operation the h2o2 production and oh at 3 0 h electro degradation 1 5 h were investigated fig s2 the background carbon felt generated 59 2 0 7 μm l 1 h2o2 pani1 4 possessed maximum h2o2 production 105 2 0 7 μm l 1 which was 25 7 and 15 5 higher than that of the control 83 7 1 6 μm l 1 and pani1 8 91 1 2 2 μm l 1 and slightly higher than that of pani1 2 98 0 1 3 μm l 1 remove the background value the h2o2 production was 24 5 0 9 μm l 1 to the control 32 0 1 5 μm l 1 to pani1 8 46 1 0 1 μm l 1 to pani1 4 47 1 0 6 μm l 1 pani1 2 which indicated that pani improved the electro synthesis of h2o2 the epr curves of the filtration air cathode presented the typical peak for the dmpo oh adduct appears as 1 2 2 1 quartet the modified electrode exhibited higher intensity than that of the control the background carbon felt also exhibited weak intensity of the typical peak suggesting that the electro oxidation of the dsa anode was present oturan et al 2021 and the dsa anode provided a part of oh for treating of tc the typical intensity of the modified electrodes was higher than that of the control suggesting that pani promoted the conversion of h2o2 to oh as shown in fig s2c the modified electrodes possessed better electrochemical performance at 0 1 v the current density of pani1 4 was 13 7 a m 2 which was 57 5 21 2 and 29 2 higher than that of the control 8 7 a m 2 pani1 8 11 3 a m 2 and pani1 2 10 6 a m 2 which indicated that pani improved the electrocatalytic activity of the filtration electrodes the current density of pani1 2 was lower than that of pani1 4 which was due to the excessive hydrophilicity of pani1 2 leading to the phenomenon of water flooding these results showed that the modified electrodes possessed higher tc removal and rejection rate which was related to the physicochemical properties as shown in fig s3 porosity conductivity and current density were positively correlated with the final tc removal except for the tc removal of pani1 2 the higher porosity and conductivity the higher tc removal the higher porosity provided more oxygen reduction site and improved o2 transfer yu et al 2016 the higher conductivity provided a stronger electric response the higher electrochemical activity provided higher electric removal the sem images of pani1 4 and pani1 2 showed a polymer layer which provided a denser surface and improved interception performance pani1 2 was more hydrophilic and prone to flooding which was not conducive to the formation of a three phase interface it also possessed lower porosity when the pollutants passed through the electrode they would block the internal channels leading to the reduction of electrochemical reaction sites therefore even though its conductivity was the highest the tc removal was still lower than pani1 4 3 3 anti fouling performance the physicochemical properties after tc degradation were investigated to characterize the anti fouling performance fig 3 after treating of the simulated wastewater the pollutants were attracted on the surface of the used membrane electrode and the modified electrode exhibited cleaner surface after degradation the porosity of the control 54 8 0 1 was decreased by 13 1 the porosity of pani1 8 71 1 0 1 pani1 4 84 3 0 1 pani1 2 72 7 0 2 was slightly lower than that of the clean electrodes the pure water flux of the used electrode was slightly decreased the flux after using the control was 61 5 0 8 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 that of pani1 8 was 79 7 1 9 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 that of pani1 4 was 95 4 3 2 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 and that of pani1 2 82 3 1 7 l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 the flux recovery rate was more than 90 91 1 for control 97 9 for pani1 8 97 9 for pani1 4 96 5 for pani1 2 the attenuation of conductivity was 8 1 for the control 6 0 for pani1 8 4 4 for pani1 4 and 7 8 for pani1 2 these results indicated that the filtration electrode possessed good anti fouling and pani improved the anti fouling performance of the filtration electrodes the rejection rate and flux recovery were investigated using 100 mg l 1 bsa fig s4 pani1 4 exhibited the highest rejection rate 63 3 1 3 which was 52 5 higher than that of the control 41 5 1 6 18 8 and 9 9 higher than that of pani1 8 53 3 1 9 and pani1 2 57 6 0 9 the flux recovery of the control pani1 8 pani1 4 and pani1 2 was 91 5 5 8 95 9 3 1 96 7 2 5 and 91 2 3 9 the modified electrodes exhibited a cleaner surface lower porosity attenuation and higher flux recovery which indicated that pani improved the anti fouling performance of the filtration cathodes the rejection rate of pani1 2 to bsa was second only to pani1 4 and the flux recovery rate was lower than pani1 8 and pani1 4 which was because a dense polymer layer was formed on the surface bsa was attached to the pores of pani1 2 and led to a decrease in filtration aperture and an increase in rejection rate the flux recovery of pani1 8 was second only to pani1 4 and the rejection rate was lower than pani1 4 and pani1 2 which was because the pore size formed on the surface of pani1 8 was larger than pani1 4 and pani1 2 although pollutants adhered to the pores but did not affect permeability 3 4 durability combined with sem images porosity and flux of the clean and used electrodes and bsa test data pani1 4 achieved the best overall performance the durability of pani1 4 at simulated wastewater was investigated fig 4 after 15 cycles 45 h the final tc removal was still higher than 80 the final tc removal was decreased by 4 3 and the rejection rate was slightly increased the contribution of electrochemical degradation in tc removal was decreased and the contribution of interception was increased a small amount of tc was attached to the surface or the internal pores of pani1 4 which reduced the electrochemical reaction sites and the degradation efficiency but the reduced membrane pores provided higher precision interception and improved the rejection rate the water flux and final tc removal were fitted according to the fitting equation at 250 and 1800 periods the attenuation of the water flux was 20 and 30 at 124 and 188 periods the attenuation of the final tc removal was 20 and 30 the minimum service life of pani1 4 was 124 periods 372 h 15 5 d 3 5 natural water background according to the specification for the application of tetracyclines in aquaculture of china sc t 1085 2006 this kind of drug needed to be taken in a medicinal bath or fed with bait therefore the removal of two concentrations 50 and 0 5 mg l 1 in the freshwater background was investigated fig 5 the original ph tcod fe2 and tfe of the river was 8 0 0 1 134 3 2 1 mg l 1 zero and zero at original ph and 3 0 tc 50 mg l 1 the final tc removal was 84 2 0 7 and 86 7 0 4 the rejection rate to tc was 44 9 1 4 and 48 6 1 3 the tcod removal was 88 2 0 7 and 90 7 0 4 the effluent tcod was 22 0 1 6 mg l 1 and 17 3 1 9 mg l 1 respectively at original ph and 3 0 tc 0 5 mg l 1 the final tc removal and rejection rate was almost 100 the tcod removal was 91 1 1 1 and 91 9 0 5 the effluent tcod was 12 0 1 6 mg l 1 and 11 0 0 8 mg l 1 respectively the tc and tcod removal at original ph was similar to that at ph 3 0 and the effluent tcod was lower than 25 mg l 1 which reached the second level standard of freshwater pond aquaculture water discharge requirements of china sc t 9101 2007 in addition literature reported that after 90 min electrochemical degradation the escherichia coli inhibition zone diameter was decreased from 14 0 to 11 0 mm xin et al 2022 and toxicity of the by products to marine bacteria was decreased after treating of electro fenton and anodic oxidation for 30 min zwane et al 2021 the electrochemical degradation process of this electro filtration system was as long as 90 min and the toxicity of the by products would be reduced at the same time the interception process would block some by products and reduce their concentration in the effluent when the residual concentration was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 the membrane like cathode would intercept the pollutant even without electrochemical degradation process and not produce by products therefore this electro filtration no need to adjust ph and adding agents was suitable for treating of freshwater aquaculture wastewater 3 6 mechanisms in the process of tc removal there were two removal processes including interception and electrochemical degradation fig 6 electrochemical oxidation as a chemical process provided oh to attack pollutants enriched by interception as shown in fig s5a the measured h2o2 concentration of the standard sample was higher than that of the pani sample at target h2o2 1 0 10 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 the measured h2o2 concentration of the pani sample was 2 6 19 7 24 9 75 5 and 77 8 lower than that of the standard sample at standard h2o2 10 and 25 mg l 1 the epr curves showed obvious oh peak after adding pani fig s5b this suggested that pani could catalyze h2o2 probably due to its fenton like activity wang et al 2019 as well as the nitrogen doped carbon materials could be used as catalysts to promote the conversion of h2o2 to oh huang and zhang 2021 so we hypothesized that the nh2 group catalyzed the h2o2 this result was consistent with the oh peak strength in epr curves the peak strength of the modified electrode was stronger than that of the control and carbon felt the tc degradation was also investigated fig s5c the tc removal of 0 5 mm fe2 was much higher than that of pani powder which was because that pani was insoluble in water and had fewer catalytic sites for h2o2 in the liquid phase but the cathode surface presented hydrophilicity due to nh2 group of pani which increased the reaction site of the liquid phase and showed higher catalytic performance than pani powder except the cathodic oh dsa also provided oh the interception and final removal amount of the background carbon felt 0 30 and 1 1 mg was much lower than that of influent tc 3 5 mg which indicated that the tc intercepted by background carbon felt reached and was at the limit the decrease of tc concentration from 90 to 180 min was due to electrochemical oxidation process therefore the amount and removal of tc removed by oh generated by dsa was 0 80 mg and 23 1 and its contribution in the final tc removal was 32 4 to the control 25 9 to pani1 8 24 6 to pani1 4 and 25 6 to pani1 2 therefore the pollutants degradation process should be as follows when the pollutants entered the reactor they were attacked by oh generated by dsa the final tc removal and rejection rate of the background carbon felt was 31 6 0 3 and 8 7 0 2 so the electrochemical removal was about 22 9 and the adsorption to tc by carbon felt was 8 7 0 2 in this process since the adsorption of carbon felt was much lower than the residual amount and the final removal was less than 50 indicating that the pollutants on the carbon felt were in the adsorption saturation state until the end of the degradation reaction therefore the electrochemical removal provided by the oh generated by dsa anode was 22 9 so the removal contribution of dsa was 24 7 the final tc removal of pani1 4 was 92 9 0 1 then the pollutants reached the cathode part of the pollutants was intercepted in the solution inside the reactor by the filter layer increasing the instantaneous concentration and part of the pollutants adhered to the filter layer carbon layer and carbon felt which as the pollutants were intercepted inside the reactor and on the cathode and further removed by oh generated by the cathode the interception of pollutants by the cathode was a dynamic process the oh generated by cathode attacked the pollutants in the solution inside the reactor and on the cathode without any difference the electrochemical degradation and interception of pollutants on the cathode existed simultaneously the reaction sites occupied by the interception of pollutants were vacated by electrochemical degradation and again occupied by the interception of pollutants and the cycle repeated thus the removal contribution of the cathode was about 75 including interception and electro oxidation in the end unoxidized and intercepted pollutants remained in the effluent according to fig 2 the removal of interception followed by interception electro oxidation was slightly higher than that of interception electro oxidation interception not only reduced the effluent pollutants concentration but also enriched pollutants to improve the efficiency of electro oxidation the improvement of pollutant removal of the filtration cathode was also related to its conductivity the conductivity of the filtration electrode was increased after adding pani which could improve the electron transfer rate and electrons reached into the cathodic reaction site faster under the constant current the electric charge supply per unit time was fixed the higher conductivity indicated that the amount of charge used for heat release was reduced and more electrons became available to participate in the cathodic reaction rather than being consumed in conduction therefore the reasons for the greatly increased pollutant removal of the modified electrode included the interception of the surface filter layer the catalysis of pani to h2o2 and the faster electron transfer 3 7 comparative analysis the water flux flux recovery removal performance and energy consumption of pani1 4 was compared with other electro filtration electrodes as shown in table 1 the water flux the physical property of the material of pani1 4 was much higher than that of the reported jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020b li et al 2020c sun et al 2020 xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 which indicated that pani1 4 possessed good permeability and high hydraulic shock load the water flux recovery of pani1 4 after filtering the pollutants jiang et al 2018 xu et al 2022 and bsa solution sun et al 2020 was also much higher than that of the literatures which indicated that pani1 4 had a strong anti fouling performance in the simulated water background the removal of pani1 4 was slightly lower than that in literatures jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020c xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 which was because of the original pollutant 50 mg l 1 was higher than that in literatures 17 8 mg l 1 and exhibited stronger oh competition to decrease the removal but the removal quantity of pani1 4 was much higher than that of the literatures jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020b li et al 2020c sun et al 2020 xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 compared with the literatures the removal quantity of pani1 4 was 31 3 li et al 2020c 8 3 times jiang et al 2020 28 2 times li et al 2020b 68 5 ye et al 2022 61 0 times jiang et al 2018 3 08 times xu et al 2022 and 1 58 times sun et al 2020 higher than that of the reported which indicated that the electro filtration reactor with pani1 4 possessed high treatment capacity at acidic ph condition the pollutant removal of the reported li et al 2020b was the lowest which consisted of the low current density 0 8 ma cm 2 compared with reaction condition of pani1 4 the literatures with higher pollutant removal had stable h2o2 supply li et al 2020c and high current density jiang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 and when the target pollutant concentration decreased the removal of pani1 4 was 100 even in the complex natural water background which indicated the acidic ph condition was not the absolute condition for obtaining high removal rate in addition to the assistance of acidic conditions the high removal rate under simulated background was ensured by its own interception performance and the electro oxidation efficiency of the system the rejection rate to the target pollutant of pani1 4 was 1 75 times jiang et al 2020 7 98 times li et al 2020b 1 64 times jiang et al 2018 34 7 xu et al 2022 higher than that of the reported which also provided high instantaneous concentration for the electro oxidation process although the treatment time was up to 3 0 h but the electrochemical degradation process was only 1 5 h which reduced the power consumption 1 5 h of interception and 1 5 h of interception electro oxidation and showed a lower energy consumption 8 57 kw h kg 1 which was also 54 4 li et al 2020c 27 1 jiang et al 2020 92 3 jiang et al 2018 and 85 6 xu et al 2022 lower than that of the reported power consumption process over the period 3 8 limitations this system possessed high removal and low energy consumption but also possessed limitations such as membrane fouling and need for power supply the common issue of electro oxidation system increasing hydrophilicity could improve anti fouling performance but excessive hydrophilicity would lead to flooding which was not conducive to cathodic reaction so it needed to be kept within a certain range and in practical application the reactor power supply and pump three functional units were separated which was not conducive to carrying and the module integration was needed in addition from the perspective of long term operation the accumulation of power consumption was high and the power source needed to be optimized such as solar energy 4 conclusions the filtration electrodes modified by pani were prepared using a phase inversion method to enhance the performance of the electro filtration reactor and provide a filtered effluent after adding pani the porosity hydrophilicity conductivity and rejection of the filtration electrodes were significantly increased pani1 4 exhibited better overall performance which had 71 1 rejection rate and 92 9 final tc removal at river water background the final tc removal was 84 2 to 50 mg l 1 and 100 to 0 5 mg l 1 at original ph it also possessed good anti fouling performance the final tc removal was decreased by 4 3 after 15 cycles the reduction of porosity was lower than 10 0 the flux recovery rate after filtration of tc and bsa was higher than 90 0 mechanism analysis showed that pani improved the removal performance by interception of the filter layer the catalysis to h2o2 and faster electron transfer this filtration electrode possessed good interception and autocatalyzing h2o2 and showed high treatment quantity and low energy consumption the dual functional membrane like cathode not a simple superposition of technical units provided a new idea for the coupling of electro oxidation and membrane and the interception also provided an energy saving application of electro oxidation
