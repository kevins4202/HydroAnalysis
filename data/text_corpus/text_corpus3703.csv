18515,the environmental behaviors and risks associated with graphene oxide go a popular 2d nanomaterial have attracted considerable attention go released to aquatic systems will most likely interact with ubiquitous nanocolloids nc in surface water however the effects of nc on the fate and risk of go remain largely unknown in water herein the binding of nc onto go was investigated via electron microscopy electron paramagnetic resonance 2d correlation spectroscopy and biolayer interferometry the results revealed that electron charge transfers hydrophilic effects and π π stacking contributed to a strong affinity kd 5 6 nm and high adsorption capacity 159 8 mg g of nc onto the go surface moreover go nanosheets transformed to a scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc which remarkably reduced the aggregation and sedimentation rates after binding with nc interestingly co exposure with nc greatly alleviated the toxicity e g tail malformation yolk sac edema and oxidative stress of go to zebrafish embryos morphological and structural alterations of go after binding to nc contributed to the mechanisms for the antagonistic effects on the zebrafish embryos toxicity the present work provides insights into the environmental fate and risk of go by ubiquitous nc in natural water graphical abstract image 1 keywords surface water engineered nanomaterials environmental fate environmental risk colloid 1 introduction natural colloids with a size range from approximately 1 to 1000 nm are important environmental components and widely present in aqueous environments stolpe et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 compared to large scale colloids 100 1000 nm nanocolloids nc approximately 1 100 nm have a large specific surface area and high dispersity which may play an important role in the fate and bioavailability of pollutants in the aquatic environment santschi 2018 xu et al 2018 although the related information remains obscure graphene oxide go a two dimensional carbon based nanomaterial presents unique structural and physical properties that highlight its applicability in various areas such as energy storage georgakilas et al 2016 biomedicine lee et al 2016 and environmental protection joshi et al 2014 since go released to aquatic systems will most likely interact with nc a deep understanding of the basic interactions between go and nc may help to better clarify the potential risks of go and provide guidance on the safe design of go given the complex compositions of nc analyzing the interaction analysis between nanomaterials and nc remains challenging two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos that is capable of resolving overlapped peaks could probe the interaction mechanisms of complex compounds phong and hur 2018 yan et al 2013 herein a 2dcos analysis that integrates synchronous fluorescence and fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir was performed to provide an in depth understanding of the binding characteristic mechanisms of nc onto go at the molecular level the affinity interactions between nc and go are fundamental to understanding the effects of nc on the environmental behaviors of go biolayer interferometry bli is a real time and label free optical technique that using fiber optic biosensors to accurately quantify and measure the affinity between molecules such as protein protein protein nucleic acids and protein small molecules gao et al 2017 hjuler et al 2017 in recent years bli has successfully used to investigate the interactions between go and molecules such as proteins single stranded dna ssdna and humic acid ha zhou et al 2019 herein bli was used to directly and accurately detect the binding affinity between go and nc the colloidal behaviors of go with dissolved organic matter dom or environmentally relevant cations e g ca2 and na have been extensively studied chowdhury et al 2015 yang et al 2016 for example chowdhury et al observed that dom improved go dispersion and divalent cations enhanced go aggregation chowdhury et al 2013 the roles of three common geogenic minerals montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite with different surface charge properties and geometric dimensions in the go mineral heteroaggregation and the environmental fate of go were also investigated zhao et al 2015 in contrast nc were extracted from the natural environment and contained inorganic mineral colloids e g fe and mn oxides and aluminosilicates aromatic refractory organic matter binding heavy metals and rigid biopolymers buffle et al 1998 ouyang et al 2018 however effects of nc on the aggregation adsorption and morphological transformation of engineered nanoparticles enps remain largely unknown go with shape edges exhibited high colloidal stability which led to adverse effects and sufficient direct contact on escherichia coli chlorella pyrenoidosa or zebrafish akhavan and ghaderi 2010 souza et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 compared to studies on the adverse effects of pristine go investigations into the environmental risks of the go binding with nc are much more meaningful in the present work the main objectives were to explore the effects of nc on the morphology aggregation uptake and ecotoxicity of go after binding zebrafish as a model was used as the tested organism the findings will provide new insights into the fate and risks of enps under the influence of nc at environmental concentrations 2

360 min on the rotator for the adsorption capacity experiments go at a final concentration 10 mg l was used as an adsorbent in batch mode and the final concentrations of nc at 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 or 20 mg l were then mixed in glass vials the final volume of the mixed suspension was 25 ml the above mixed suspension was shaken on the rotator at 160 r min for 24 h the amounts of nc adsorbed

filtrate was analyzed by a tu 1901 spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd china at 200 nm abs200 furthermore pseudo first pseudo second order kinetics and an intraparticle diffusion model ipdm were used to analyze the adsorption kinetics the details on the adsorption kinetics models are presented in the si 2 6 aggregation and sedimentation of go in the presence of nc the colloidal stability of go plays a crucial role in its fate and health risk zhao et al 2014 the aggregation experiments of go and nc were performed at 25 c ph 7 0 and in the presence of 40 mm nacl

concentration of go c0 10 mg l to the suspended concentration of go c were used to characterize the go sedimentation kinetics the details are provided in the si 2 7 nanomaterial exposure of zebrafish embryos zebrafish is a model species for the testing of the aquatic toxicity of nanoparticles and traditional pollutants sun et al 2013 the fish embryo toxicity test fet of zebrafish embryos ab strains was performed for 96 h according to test guideline 236 of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd schreiber et al 2018 embryos were obtained according our previous reports zhang et al 2017 and collected immediately after fertilization and sorted to remove feces and infertile eggs by washing with e3 medium consisting of 5 mm nacl 0 17 mm kcl 0 33 mm cacl2 and 0 33 mm mgso4 ph 7 4 e3 medium could provide a safe incubation environment and necessary nutrition for zebrafish embryos and always served as control groups when embryos were maintained in the e3 culture medium chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as shown in previous studies the e3 medium did not affect the interactions between zebrafish and nanoparticles gupta et al 2019 ong et al 2017 to investigate the zebrafish larval toxicity of go at predicted environmental concentrations zebrafish embryos exposed to go at 0 e3 0 01 mg l 0 1 mg l and 1 mg l were analyzed given the detected environmental concentrations in table s1 nc were directly diluted to 4 mg l with e3 medium then the collected zebrafish embryos were exposed to e3 medium control nc 4 mg l go 0 01 1 mg l and go nc 0 01 1 mg l go 4 mg l nc in 96 well plates from 2 5 h postfertilization hpf to 96 hpf the embryos were observed daily and the survival rates and malformations were recorded via optical microscopy olympus zl 61 olympus japan the generation of reactive oxygen species ros was measured using a fluorescence microscope olympus x71 olympus japan with 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da as a probe zhang et al 2017 2 8 imaging by confocal fluorescence microscope after incubation with nanoparticles for 96 h the zebrafish were immediately washed with e3 medium to remove the nanoparticles from the surface of the zebrafish subsequently the fluorescence in zebrafish was investigated using a confocal fluorescence microscope lsm880 with airyscan meta carl zeiss ag oberkochen germany with an excitation wavelength at 405 nm zen software zen2010 zeiss germany was used to quantitatively evaluate the fluorescence images five embryos were observed from each of three treatment replicates 2 9 data analysis ibm spss 22 0 statistical software was used for the statistical analyses and a one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s test was employed to analyze the significant differences at p 0 05 all samples were at least performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean the standard deviation for the adsorption experiments the intraparticle diffusion models were employed in origin 9 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 complicated nc enriched from surface water the morphology and size distribution of the nc were examined via transmission electron microscopy tem and atomic force microscopy afm fig s2a 2d most of the observed nc presented irregular or flaky grain shapes and the size and the thickness of the nc were predominantly 70 smaller than 40 nm and 10 nm respectively the nc with size ranges of 1 20 and 21 40 nm accounted for 42 and 50 respectively fig s2b the mean size of the nc was approximately 20 nm furthermore the afm size distribution histograms fig s2d indicated that the majority 65 of the observed nc thicknesses were approximately 1 10 nm which was consistent with our previous report ouyang et al 2018 the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig s2e and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps figs s3a s3b and table s2 results indicated that the main chemical compositions of nc included carbon oxygen nitrogen and heavy metals the details are presented in the si the mean size approximately 20 nm of the nc was larger than that of carbon dots 10 nm ye et al 2013 and similar to that of humic acid ha 20 30 nm chen et al 2015 the o c ratios were ranked as follows ha approximately 0 5 nc approximately 0 3 carbon dots approximately 0 15 kang and xing 2008 yang et al 2015 moreover multiple spectral analyses such as raman x ray diffraction xrd and uv vis revealed that there were abundant hydrophilic functional groups e g the carboxyl group and aromatic compounds on the surfaces of nc figs s3c s3f the details are presented in the si the initial ph of nc suspension was 6 98 table s1 the zeta potentials of nc suspension at different ph were shown in fig s4 the point of zero charge phpzc of nc was ph 2 2 table s1 and the surface charge of nc remained negative over the ph range from 3 0 to 10 0 thus negatively charged nc with zeta potential approximately at 25 mv ph 7 0 was considered to be electrostatically stable 3 2 morphological and structural alterations of go nanosheets induced by nc the afm images n 15 shown in fig 1 a indicate that the width of the go was 1 9 μm 0 3 μm and the thickness was 1 1 0 1 nm which were similar to the width and thickness of single layer go approximately 1 nm fu et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b numerous nanoparticles average 8 2 2 4 nm were unevenly distributed on the surface of the go after treatment with nc moreover the width of the go decreased to 1 0 0 2 μm while the thicknesses increased to 3 2 0 3 nm suggesting that the large nanosheet morphology transformed into a scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc fig 1b as shown in fig 1c the tem images n 15 showed that pristine go had some wrinkles at the edge of the plane and the lateral length and width of the go were approximately 3 5 μm and 2 5 μm respectively after treatment with nc there were many irregular nanoparticles unevenly covering the go surface and the width of go was decreased to 1 1 0 2 μm n 15 fig 1d the above results were consistent with the afm results fig 1b the eds analysis results fig 1e and s2e supported that the chemical composition of the covered nanoparticles on the go surface included nitrogen and heavy metals e g fe and cr thereby demonstrating that these nanoparticles originated from nc during adsorption onto go moreover go s wrinkle and roughness serving as a steric hindrance may be the main mechanism for the wrinkle adsorption and structural investigations indicated that the roughness served as a steric hindrance for the unevenly adsorption of nc tang et al 2018 next raman spectrometry rs was used to analyze the structure of the go before and after the adsorption of nc treatments as shown in fig 1f the intensity ratio of the d to g bands id ig is normally used for measuring the amount of defects and also a good parameter for estimating the degree of graphitization of go lópez díaz et al 2017 there were no significant d band 1350 cm 1 and g band 1594 cm 1 in nc sample fig s3c while the id ig ratios 1 01 0 01 n 3 of the go nc hybrids were significantly p 0 05 larger than that of the go 0 98 0 01 n 3 fig 1f denoting that the reduction of go drove by nc the structural alterations of the go induced by nc were further investigated using xrd as shown in fig 1g the sharp 001 diffraction peak of go at 11 indicated a highly organized crystal structure and an approximately 0 80 nm full width at half maximum fwhm hu et al 2015 the go nc hybrids exhibited a diffraction peak at 9 8 and the fwhm was approximately 0 90 nm the larger fwhm implied that the go nc hybrids were composed of a larger number of multilayer graphene nanosheets than go and the crystal structures were partly damaged wang et al 2016 these results were consistent with the afm and tem results in fig 1a d moreover the changes in the d spacings might be affected by the incorporation of water molecules the introduction of defects and oxygen nitrogen functional groups ali et al 2014 hu et al 2015 3 3 electron charge transfer between nc and go as shown in fig 1 h the uv vis absorption peak of pristine go was observed at approximately 235 nm while a 25 nm peak redshift and hypochromic effect were observed after the adsorption of nc the uv vis absorption peak of go at 230 nm was due to π π transitions and the red shifting of go was ascribed to the reduction of go goodwin et al 2018 rattana et al 2012 moreover the pristine of go exhibited a small peak at 300 nm due to the n π transitions of the oxygen functional groups goodwin et al 2018 however the above peak did not seem obvious in the spectrum of go nc when go was suspended in a natural water in the presence of visible light the disappearance of small peak was ascribed to reduction of go goodwin et al 2018 the above results imply nc may have reduced the go which is consistent with the raman result in fig 1f in fig 1i the g values of go and go nc at 2 0059 and 2 0053 respectively represented a typical semiquinone type free radical signal scott et al 1998 whereas a significant signal was not observed for nc fig s3f the go had a larger width resonance line and a higher signal intensity than those of go nc thus representing that go nc hybrids had lower levels of semiquinone type unpaired electrons the π π transition and the semiquinone type free radical quenching proofed the occurrence of electron charge transfer during the hybridization of go with nc healing of defects was an important mechanism for the reduction of go while electronic properties of go could be strongly affected by the defects in go pei and cheng 2012 thus the electron transfer between go and nc may lead to the reduction of go as shown in fig s5 and table s2 go contained 77 32 c 1s 22 53 o 1s and 0 15 s 2p while nc included 65 72 c 1s 27 45 o 1s 2 04 n 1s 1 15 s 2p 0 07 f 1s and 3 57 heavy metals e g cr and ca limited amounts of n na and heavy metals were observed in the go nc hybrid as shown in fig 1j k and table s3 after the treatment with nc the content of c c 36 19 in the go nc significantly decreased moreover the contents of c o 18 86 and c n 16 42 significantly increased generally an increase in the nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups would expand the d spacing of graphene ali et al 2014 which is consistent with the alterations in the structure explained by the xrd analysis fig 1g 3 4 correlation analysis of the structural change in the go nc interaction to further probe the interaction mechanisms between go and nc synchronous fluorescence and ftir spectroscopies were used to probe the spectral changes of go during its interaction with the nc as shown in figs s6a and s6b three fluorescence regions at 240 300 300 380 and 380 500 nm were assigned to protein like fulvic like and humic like fluorescence fractions respectively the three fluorescence regions increased remarkably with the nc concentrations the ftir results were similar to that of synchronous fluorescence the ftir absorbance spectra and the differential ftir absorbance spectra were shown in fig s7a and fig s7b respectively the vibrational information on go backbones was identified at 750 1750 cm 1 the peaks corresponding to the skeletal vibrations of aromatic c c bonds shifted from 1620 to 1637 cm 1 after adsorption of nc onto go fig s7a which implied the occurrence of π π interactions between go and the aromatic structures of nc moreover at 0 30 mg l nc the characteristic peak at 1100 cm 1 assigned to the stretching vibrations of polysaccharide c o was initially narrowed and then broadened at higher concentrations 40 90 mg l of nc figs s7a s7b the broadening of the absorption band at the peak of 1100 cm 1 was probably due to the formation of c n bonds lin et al 2012 which was consistent with the xps results in fig 1k and table s3 to determine the conformational changes of go in the binding process with the nc 2dcos and hetero 2dcos analyses were performed using the synchronous fluorescence and ftir spectra as shown in fig 2 a two predominant autopeaks centered at 280 and 360 nm and a small peak at 410 nm increased remarkably from the cross peaks indicating the fluorescence of protein and fulvic like fractions bound to nc supported by the uv vis and epr spectra analysis fig 1h i the increase in the fulvic like fraction occurred because of intramolecular charge transfer interactions between aromatic structure donors and quinoid or other acceptors sharpless and blough 2014 the asynchronous map provided the sequential relationship among these fractions fig 2b the cross peaks 360 280 and 360 410 both exhibited positive signs indicating that the intensity variation followed the order 360 nm fulvic like fractions 280 nm protein like fractions 410 nm humic like fractions the fractions in nc played critical roles in the interactions between nc and go furthermore the synchronous and asynchronous 2d ircos maps of the interaction between the go and nc at various concentrations are shown in fig 2c and 2d respectively the sign and assignment of each cross peak in the synchronous and asynchronous maps are listed in table s4 six autopeaks 1650 1620 1560 1384 1100 and 830 cm 1 were observed in the synchronous and asynchronous map and most of the cross peaks were negative for example the band at 1100 cm 1 attributed to the c o of polysaccharides decreased most significantly this result was consistent with the xps results table s3 using the sequential order rules the structural change sequence of go backbones by nc binding followed the order c o of polysaccharides carboxyl aromatic νc c which implied that the binding affinities of hydrophilic sites were higher than those of hydrophobic sites the 2d ftir cos results suggested that not only the fluorescent groups but also some nonfluorescent groups such as polysaccharides and aromatic structure of the go were involved in the binding process of the nc with go to determine the correlation between the fluorescence and ftir spectra a fluorescence ir hetero 2dcos analysis was performed as shown in fig 2e and 2f in the synchronous map fig 2e five cross peaks were located observably in the ftir regions of 1100 1384 1560 1620 and 1650 cm 1 and the corresponding fluorescence region of 360 nm the cross peaks of 1100 and 1384 cm 1 with 360 nm were negative while the others were positive the band centered at 1100 cm 1 polysaccharide νc o and 1384 cm 1 phenolic νc o with 360 nm changed most significantly thus indicating that the carboxyl phenolic and polysaccharide groups of nc were the basic fluorescence units for the fulvic like fraction these hydrophilic groups were involved in the interactions between the nc and go for the asynchronous map fig 2f a cross peak at 1620 cm 1 aromatic νc c with a fluorescence peak at 340 420 nm were observed implying that a π π interaction occurred and promoted nc binding to go 3 5 affinity between nc and go to confirm and quantitatively analyze the binding affinities between go and nc a bli experiment was conducted as illustrated in fig 3 as shown fig 3a go could form a stable layer on the surface of the aps sensor tip and then the go aps sensors were incubated with a different concentration gradient of nc to measure the corresponding association and dissociation signals according to the raw bli data fig 3b the classic association dissociation curves of the binding of nc onto go are shown in fig 3c the results of fig 3a c in details were provided in the si the calculated average values of on rate kon and off rate koff were 2 7 104 1 ms and 1 5 10 4 1 s respectively moreover fig 3c exhibited a good association and dissociation kinetics correlation coefficient r2 0 99 indicated the effective binding of nc as evident from the go aps tips and the affinity constant kd the ratio of koff to kon was 5 6 nm indicating a high binding affinity of nc to go the lower kd values reflected larger binding affinities barba spaeth et al 2016 the affinity of the nc to go was notably greater than that of certain blood proteins e g transferrin kd 3660 nm chong et al 2015 and high molecular weight ha 576 nm 3351 nm to go zhou et al 2019 the amounts of nc adsorbed onto go were determined based on the uv vis absorbance abs200 and the calibration curve between abs200 and the nc concentration is presented in fig s8 after reaching adsorption equilibrium the mixed suspension was centrifuged 14 000 g 15 min and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane consequently the both go or go nc 0 22 μm was all removed and did not affect the determination of nc at abs200 as shown in fig 4 a c and table s5 the adsorption of the nc to go was dependent on both time and concentration the adsorption of the nc on go increased rapidly in the initial 1 h and reached an adsorption equilibrium in approximately 4 h fig 4a the rapid sorption of the nc onto go was fitted by the pseudo first order pseudo second order and ipdm models fig 4a b and the kinetic parameters were presented in table s5 for all the adsorption models the correlation coefficients for pseudo first order model r2 0 984 were relatively higher than those of the pseudo second order r2 0 970 and ipdm r2 0 856 indicating that both flat surface adsorption and rate limiting mechanisms were important in the adsorption process of nc onto go moreover the ipdm modeling was used to elucidate the rate limiting step of the adsorption fig 4b the regression of q versus t1 2 was linear but the c value 9 7 1 4 mg g did not pass through the origin c was not equal to zero table s5 indicating that the adsorption process involved intraparticle diffusion and other rate limiting steps wang et al 2016 in addition to flat surface adsorption the rate limiting step for the adsorption of nc after 100 min should be attributed to intraparticle diffusion in the adsorption on go occurring mainly in scroll morphology or multiple go particles structure formed by nc the adsorption capacities of the nc on go were further confirmed as shown in fig 4c as the binding process of the nc onto go reached equilibrium within 120 240 min fig 4a the adsorption capacity of the go for nc was approximately 159 8 5 2 mg g the adsorption capacity of the nc was higher than that of ha 69 0 mg g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons molecules 2 62 6 12 mg g and heavy metal ion such as cd ii 106 3 mg g and co ii 68 2 mg g and cu ii 11 4 mg g on go lee et al 2015 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2011 3 6 nc promote the dispersity of go in water the aggregation profiles of the go in the presence nc are shown in fig 4d the initial dh of go was approximately 250 nm and then increased rapidly to approximately 800 nm at 1500 s indicating the instability of go moreover values of the aggregation rate constant kα were used to normalize the aggregation kinetics of go as shown in fig s9 the kα value of pristine go in milli q water was 0 523 nm s while the kα of go decreased to 0 458 and 0 304 nm s in the presence of nc at levels of 0 1 and 10 mg l respectively overall the go dispersity was improved significantly as the nc concentration increased from 0 1 to 10 mg l which was similar to that in the presence of ha divalent cations and organic macromolecules produced by organisms e g alginate the kα value of go in the presence of nc was lower than that in the presence of metal cations approximately 0 7 nm s chowdhury et al 2013 the above kα value was higher than that in the presence of ha or alginate approximately 0 3 nm s and bovine serum albumin bsa which had virtually no effect on go aggregation feng et al 2019 moreover the influence of nc on the sedimentation of go were also investigated as shown in fig 4e apparent aggregates were not observed before 4 h while visible aggregates appeared at the bottom of the suspensions and the color turned dark brown from light brown over time denoted by the red box the precipitation in fig 4e was consistent with the observed adsorption kinetics shown in fig 4a the free nc were removed by washing with mill q water in addition the residual nc did not affect the measurement of the upper go concentration at 280 nm because the absorbance of nc at 280 nm was much weaker than that of go 0 016 vs 0 138 thus the concentration c of go in the upper suspension was determined based on the uv vis absorbance at 280 nm abs280 the calibration curve between abs280 values and go concentrations is presented in fig s10 the ratio of the upper go concentration to the initial go concentration c c0 decreased with the sedimentation time fig 4f the rates of sedimentation for go nc were smaller than those of go alone the sedimentation rate was approximately 0 0125 mg h for go at 10 mg l nc go nc concentration ratio 1 which was remarkably lower than that of go with cations e g ca2 and na or ha castro et al 2018 chowdhury et al 2015 after 24 h 78 7 8 mg l and 85 8 5 mg l of go the initial concentration was 10 mg l remained suspended in the presence of nc at 1 and 10 mg l respectively fig 4f thus nc at environmentally relevant concentrations promoted the dispersity of go in water once release into aquatic environments go was likely to interact with nc a possible aggregation sedimentation processes during go nc interaction was bridging go bridging caused flocculation with ha and then go settled out from water yang et al 2013 the afm fig 1b and tem fig 1d results showed that go might transform into multiple go particles bridging by nc the present work also found that the dh of go increased in the presence of nc fig 4d and the flocculation of go with nc settled out after 6 h fig 4e moreover nc adsorption on go via electron charge transfer π π stacking interactions and hydrophilic effects as described above leading to the improvement of the stability of go sheets electrostatic repulsion was a major driving force preventing the go from aggregating zhao et al 2014 the charge repulsions may overcome the aggregation of go by nc with negative charges in addition the hydrophobicity of go was another important factor for go dispersion in aquatic environments it was reported that organic macromolecules such as ha bovine bsa and alginate could reduce go sedimentation feng et al 2019 similarly nc also exhibited a good dispersion performance toward go through hydrophilic effects 3 7 nc mitigate the toxicity on zebrafish embryo induced by go as presented above nc remarkably affect the physicochemical properties of go in water although the environmental risks in association with go remain unknown to explore the effects of nc on the go risk zebrafish were exposed to nc at a concentration of 4 mg l environmental concentrations 3 88 0 52 mg l listed in table s1 and go from 0 01 mg l to 1 mg l compared to the control fig 5 a at 96 hpf nc 4 mg l exposure resulted in distinct tail malformations denoted by the red arrows as shown in fig 5b while the yolk sac edema denoted by the green arrows of zebrafish larvae were significantly induced by go exposure at 1 mg l fig 5c interestingly the above distinct malformations in zebrafish embryos were alleviated at go 1 mg l plus nc 4 mg l co exposure fig 5d as shown in fig 5e the mortality rate in nc go and go nc exposure groups were approximately 15 4 15 4 and 24 1 respectively and all nanoparticles exposure groups were significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the control group 9 2 moreover the addition of nc significantly p 0 05 reduced the mortality rates induced by go at 0 1 mg l and 1 mg l similar results were observed for the malformations in fig 5f g comparing to the nc or go group alone the malformations in go nc co exposure group significantly p 0 05 decreased fig 5f g for example go nc did not induce obvious occurrences of tail malformations our previous reports found zebrafish exhibited remarkable developmental toxicity after trace go 0 001 0 1 mg l exposure zhang et al 2017 small size of nc containing trace heavy metals such as cr fig s2 could exhibited severe growth inhibition and oxidative stress on chlorella vulgaris after exposure to nc 0 72 36 mg l ouyang et al 2018 the antagonism effects of zebrafish developmental toxicity after go co exposure with nc deserve much attention oxidative stress is one of the identified teratogenic mechanisms in fish zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 5h and fig s11 the relative ros fluorescence intensity for go at 1 mg l and nc at 4 mg l was 37 1 and 28 4 higher than the control respectively in contrast co exposure of go nc alleviated the oxidative stress induced by go or nc being consistent with the zebrafish developmental toxicity results fig 5a g the mechanisms of the decrease in ros induced by go upon interactions with nc were complicated thicker scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc was observed in fig 1b and 1d thicker multiple layer go sheets induced lower intracellular oxidative stress zhao et al 2014 thicker scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc was formed as shown in fig 1b and d moreover the organic matters e g ha could passivate go and reduce the ros levels chen et al 2015 nc containing lots of organic matters may play the similar passivation against ros in addition the increase of the id ig ratio from raman spectra fig 1f and red shifting of go in uv vis spectra fig 1h supported the reduction of go go induced greater intracellular oxidative stress than reduced go hashemi et al 2014 moreover the uptake and distribution of nanoparticles may directly alter the effects on zebrafish embryo developmental toxicity and oxidative stress seabra et al 2014 as described below 3 8 nc regulate the uptake and distribution of go in vivo the uptake and translocation of nc go and go nc were detected using confocal fluorescence microscope as shown in fig 6 for the control group fig 6a a notable blue fluorescence signal was not observed in contrast blue fluorescence signals were observed in all exposure groups fig 6b d indicating that nc and go nc were present near the heart and yolk sac and the aortic blood and intestines in contrast the heart yolk sac and intestines were the main locations of the go in zebrafish fig 6c in fig 6e the relative blue fluorescence intensity was used to analyze the uptake and distribution of nanoparticles in the zebrafish for all exposure groups the mean fluorescence intensities of the heart and intestines were higher than that of the total body the blue fluorescence intensities of zebrafish exposed to a go suspension were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the control group e3 the fluorescence intensity of aortic blood significantly p 0 05 increased in both the nc and go nc groups suggesting that nc and go nc could enter the blood circulation the intestinal tract was the main pathway by which zebrafish larvae uptake nanoparticles brun et al 2018 interestingly the fluorescence intensity of go nc groups were significantly p 0 05 lower than that of nc groups suggesting that the uptake of go reduced in zebrafish larvae when go was adsorbed to nc similar trends were also observed in the fluorescence intensities of the heart and yolk sac the physicochemical properties of go in aquatic environment affected their bioavailability and toxicity to aquatic organisms go tended to form a stable colloid dispersion avoiding aggregation and sedimentation and was easy to be internalized and removed from the biological body seabra et al 2014 after binding to nc go nc presented smaller size fig 1b and 1d and higher hydrophilic than go thus the hydrophilic go nc sheets could be readily excreted from zebrafish larva physical damage from nanomaterials was an important reason for nanotoxicity de planque et al 2011 the sharp edges of go induced physical damage to cells akhavan and ghaderi 2010 therefore nc could reduce the bioavailability of go and direct interaction with zebrafish larva and then resulted in the mitigation of the developmental toxicity and oxidative stress of zebrafish embryo 4 conclusions in the present study the multiple analytical methods e g bli and 2dcos revealed that the nc exhibited a high binding affinity onto go via hydrophilic effects electron charge transfers and π π stacking interactions nc adsorption also promoted the dispersity of go in water after binding to nc the properties e g morphology and structure of go changed morphology was a critical factor that affected graphene nanotoxicity hu et al 2015 the pristine go was transformed into a scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc and the thickness of go increased as described in fig 1b and 1d compared to the thin of pristine go the thicker multiple go nc induced lower intracellular oxidative stress fig 5h moreover treated go nc had a smaller size and higher hydrophilic groups could be readily removed from zebrafish larva reducing the bioavailability of go it is important to consider the systematic effects of these properties and environmental behaviors when assessing the health risks of go overall the co exposure of go nc resulted in markedly reduced zebrafish embryo toxicity compared with the go or nc alone due to the effects on nanoparticle uptake and distribution in vivo and reduction of oxidative stress given the obvious roles of nc in the morphology aggregation and toxicity of go the present work shows that the environmental risks of enps in water should be reexamined declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

18515,the environmental behaviors and risks associated with graphene oxide go a popular 2d nanomaterial have attracted considerable attention go released to aquatic systems will most likely interact with ubiquitous nanocolloids nc in surface water however the effects of nc on the fate and risk of go remain largely unknown in water herein the binding of nc onto go was investigated via electron microscopy electron paramagnetic resonance 2d correlation spectroscopy and biolayer interferometry the results revealed that electron charge transfers hydrophilic effects and π π stacking contributed to a strong affinity kd 5 6 nm and high adsorption capacity 159 8 mg g of nc onto the go surface moreover go nanosheets transformed to a scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc which remarkably reduced the aggregation and sedimentation rates after binding with nc interestingly co exposure with nc greatly alleviated the toxicity e g tail malformation yolk sac edema and oxidative stress of go to zebrafish embryos morphological and structural alterations of go after binding to nc contributed to the mechanisms for the antagonistic effects on the zebrafish embryos toxicity the

fate environmental risk colloid 1 introduction natural colloids with a size range from approximately 1 to 1000 nm are important environmental components and widely present in aqueous environments stolpe et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 compared to large scale colloids 100 1000 nm nanocolloids nc approximately 1 100 nm have a large specific surface area and high dispersity which may play an important role in the fate and bioavailability of pollutants in the aquatic environment santschi 2018 xu et al 2018 although the related information remains obscure graphene oxide go a two dimensional carbon based nanomaterial presents unique structural and physical properties that highlight its applicability in various areas such as energy storage georgakilas et al 2016 biomedicine lee et al 2016 and environmental protection joshi et al 2014 since go released to aquatic systems will most likely interact with nc a deep understanding of the basic interactions between go and nc may help to better clarify the potential risks of go and provide guidance on the safe design of go given the complex compositions of nc analyzing the interaction analysis between nanomaterials and nc remains challenging two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos that is capable of resolving overlapped peaks could probe the interaction mechanisms of complex compounds phong and hur 2018 yan et al 2013 herein a 2dcos analysis that integrates synchronous fluorescence and fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir was performed to provide an in depth understanding of the binding characteristic mechanisms of nc onto go at the molecular level the affinity interactions between nc and go are fundamental to understanding the effects of nc on the environmental behaviors of go biolayer interferometry bli is a real time and label free optical technique that using fiber optic biosensors to accurately quantify and measure the affinity between molecules such as protein protein protein nucleic acids and protein small molecules gao et al 2017 hjuler et al 2017 in recent years bli has successfully used to investigate the interactions between go and molecules such as proteins single stranded dna ssdna and humic acid ha zhou et al 2019 herein bli was used to directly and accurately detect the binding affinity between go and nc the colloidal behaviors of go with dissolved organic matter dom or environmentally relevant cations e g ca2 and na have been extensively studied chowdhury et al 2015 yang et al 2016 for example chowdhury et al observed that dom improved go dispersion and divalent cations enhanced go aggregation chowdhury et al 2013 the roles of three common geogenic minerals montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite with different surface charge properties and geometric dimensions in the go mineral heteroaggregation and the environmental fate of go were also investigated zhao et al 2015 in contrast nc were extracted from the natural environment and contained inorganic mineral colloids e g fe and mn oxides and aluminosilicates aromatic refractory organic matter binding heavy metals and rigid biopolymers buffle et al 1998 ouyang et al 2018 however effects of nc on the aggregation adsorption and morphological transformation of engineered nanoparticles enps remain largely unknown go with shape edges exhibited high colloidal stability which led to adverse effects and sufficient direct contact on escherichia coli chlorella pyrenoidosa or zebrafish akhavan and ghaderi 2010 souza et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 compared to studies on the adverse effects of pristine go investigations into the environmental risks of the go binding with nc are much more meaningful in the present work the main objectives were to explore the effects of nc on the morphology aggregation uptake and ecotoxicity of go after binding zebrafish as a model was used as the tested organism the findings will provide new insights into the fate and risks of enps under the influence of nc at environmental concentrations 2

360 min on the rotator for the adsorption capacity experiments go at a final concentration 10 mg l was used as an adsorbent in batch mode and the final concentrations of nc at 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 or 20 mg l were then mixed in glass vials the final volume of the mixed suspension was 25 ml the above mixed suspension was shaken on the rotator at 160 r min for 24 h the amounts of nc adsorbed

filtrate was analyzed by a tu 1901 spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd china at 200 nm abs200 furthermore pseudo first pseudo second order kinetics and an intraparticle diffusion model ipdm were used to analyze the adsorption kinetics the details on the adsorption kinetics models are presented in the si 2 6 aggregation and sedimentation of go in the presence of nc the colloidal stability of go plays a crucial role in its fate and health risk zhao et al 2014 the aggregation experiments of go and nc were performed at 25 c ph 7 0 and in the presence of 40 mm nacl

concentration of go c0 10 mg l to the suspended concentration of go c were used to characterize the go sedimentation kinetics the details are provided in the si 2 7 nanomaterial exposure of zebrafish embryos zebrafish is a model species for the testing of the aquatic toxicity of nanoparticles and traditional pollutants sun et al 2013 the fish embryo toxicity test fet of zebrafish embryos ab strains was performed for 96 h according to test guideline 236 of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd schreiber et al 2018 embryos were obtained according our previous reports zhang et al 2017 and collected immediately after fertilization and sorted to remove feces and infertile eggs by washing with e3 medium consisting of 5 mm nacl 0 17 mm kcl 0 33 mm cacl2 and 0 33 mm mgso4 ph 7 4 e3 medium could provide a safe incubation environment and necessary nutrition for zebrafish embryos and always served as control groups when embryos were maintained in the e3 culture medium chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as shown in previous studies the e3 medium did not affect the interactions between zebrafish and nanoparticles gupta et al 2019 ong et al 2017 to investigate the zebrafish larval toxicity of go at predicted environmental concentrations zebrafish embryos exposed to go at 0 e3 0 01 mg l 0 1 mg l and 1 mg l were analyzed given the detected

01 1 mg l go 4 mg l nc in 96 well plates from 2 5 h postfertilization hpf to 96 hpf the embryos were observed daily and the survival rates and malformations were recorded via optical microscopy olympus zl 61 olympus japan the generation of reactive oxygen species ros was measured using a fluorescence microscope olympus x71 olympus japan with 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da as a probe zhang et al 2017 2 8 imaging by confocal fluorescence microscope after incubation with nanoparticles for 96 h the zebrafish were immediately washed with e3 medium to remove the nanoparticles from the surface of the zebrafish subsequently the fluorescence in zebrafish was investigated using a confocal fluorescence microscope lsm880 with airyscan meta carl zeiss ag oberkochen germany with an excitation wavelength at 405 nm zen software zen2010 zeiss germany was used to quantitatively evaluate the fluorescence images five embryos were observed from each of three treatment replicates 2 9 data analysis ibm spss 22 0 statistical software was used for the statistical analyses and a one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s test was employed to analyze the significant differences at p 0 05 all samples were at least performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean the standard deviation for the adsorption experiments the intraparticle diffusion models were employed in origin 9 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 complicated nc enriched from surface water the morphology and size distribution of the nc were examined via transmission electron microscopy tem and atomic force microscopy afm fig s2a 2d most of the observed nc presented irregular or flaky grain shapes and the size and the thickness of the nc were predominantly 70 smaller than 40 nm and 10 nm respectively the nc with size ranges of 1 20 and 21 40 nm accounted for 42 and 50 respectively fig s2b the mean size of the nc was approximately 20 nm furthermore the afm size distribution histograms fig s2d indicated that the majority 65 of the observed nc thicknesses were approximately 1 10 nm which was consistent with our previous report ouyang et al 2018 the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig s2e and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps figs s3a s3b and table s2 results indicated that the main chemical compositions of nc included carbon oxygen nitrogen and heavy metals the details are presented in the si the mean size approximately 20 nm of the nc was larger than that of carbon dots 10 nm ye et al 2013 and similar to that of humic acid ha 20 30 nm chen et al 2015 the o c ratios were ranked as follows ha approximately 0 5 nc approximately 0 3 carbon dots approximately 0 15 kang and xing 2008 yang et al 2015 moreover multiple spectral analyses such as raman x ray diffraction xrd and uv vis revealed that there were abundant hydrophilic functional groups e g the carboxyl group and aromatic compounds on the surfaces of nc figs s3c s3f the details are presented in the si the initial ph of nc suspension was 6 98 table s1 the zeta potentials of nc suspension at different ph were shown in fig s4 the point of zero charge phpzc of nc was ph 2 2 table s1 and the surface charge of nc remained negative over the ph range from 3 0 to 10 0 thus negatively charged nc with zeta potential approximately at 25 mv ph 7 0 was considered to be electrostatically stable 3 2 morphological and structural alterations of go nanosheets induced by nc the afm images n 15 shown in fig 1 a indicate that the width of the go was 1 9 μm 0 3 μm and the thickness was 1 1 0 1 nm which were similar to the width and thickness of single layer go approximately 1 nm fu et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b numerous nanoparticles average 8 2 2 4 nm were unevenly distributed on the surface of the go after treatment with nc moreover the width of the go decreased to 1 0 0 2 μm while the thicknesses increased to 3 2 0 3 nm suggesting that the large nanosheet morphology transformed into a scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc fig 1b as shown in fig 1c the tem images n 15 showed that pristine go had some wrinkles at the edge of the plane and the lateral length and width of the go were approximately 3 5 μm and 2 5 μm respectively after treatment with nc there were many irregular nanoparticles unevenly covering the go surface and the width of go was decreased to 1 1 0 2 μm n 15 fig 1d the above results were consistent with the afm results fig 1b the eds analysis results fig 1e and s2e supported that the chemical composition of the covered nanoparticles on the go surface included nitrogen and heavy metals e g fe and cr thereby demonstrating that these nanoparticles originated from nc during adsorption onto go moreover go s wrinkle and roughness serving as a steric hindrance may be the main mechanism for the wrinkle adsorption and structural investigations indicated that the roughness served as a steric hindrance for the unevenly adsorption of nc tang et al 2018 next raman spectrometry rs was used to analyze the structure of the go before and after the adsorption of nc treatments as shown in fig 1f the intensity ratio of the d to g bands id ig is normally used for measuring the amount of defects and also a good parameter for estimating the degree of graphitization of go lópez díaz et al 2017 there were no significant d band 1350 cm 1 and g band 1594 cm 1 in nc sample fig s3c while the id ig ratios 1 01 0 01 n 3 of the go nc hybrids were significantly p 0 05 larger than that of the go 0 98 0 01 n 3 fig 1f denoting that the reduction of go drove by nc the structural alterations of the go induced by nc were further investigated using xrd as shown in fig 1g the sharp 001 diffraction peak of go at 11 indicated a highly organized crystal structure and an approximately 0 80 nm full width at half maximum fwhm hu et al 2015 the go nc hybrids exhibited a diffraction peak at 9 8 and the fwhm was approximately 0 90 nm the larger fwhm implied that the go nc hybrids were composed of a larger number of multilayer graphene nanosheets than go and the crystal structures were partly damaged wang et al 2016 these results were consistent with the afm and tem results in fig 1a d moreover the changes in the d spacings might be affected by the incorporation of water molecules the introduction of defects and oxygen nitrogen functional groups ali et al 2014 hu et al 2015 3 3 electron charge transfer between nc and go as shown in fig 1 h the uv vis absorption peak of pristine go was observed at approximately 235 nm while a 25 nm peak redshift and hypochromic effect were observed after the adsorption of nc the uv vis absorption peak of go at 230 nm was due to π π transitions and the red shifting of go was ascribed to the reduction of go goodwin et al 2018 rattana et al 2012 moreover the pristine of go exhibited a small peak at 300 nm due to the n π transitions of the oxygen functional groups goodwin et al 2018 however the above peak did not seem obvious in the spectrum of go nc when go was suspended in a natural water in the presence of visible light the disappearance of small peak was ascribed to reduction of go goodwin et al 2018 the above results imply nc may have reduced the go which is consistent with the raman result in fig 1f in fig 1i the g values of go and go nc at 2 0059 and 2 0053 respectively represented a typical semiquinone type free radical signal scott et al 1998 whereas a significant signal was not observed for nc fig s3f the go had a larger width resonance line and a higher signal intensity than those of go nc thus representing that go nc hybrids had lower levels of semiquinone type unpaired electrons the π π transition and the semiquinone type free radical quenching proofed the occurrence of electron charge transfer during the hybridization of go with nc healing of defects was an important mechanism for the reduction of go while electronic properties of go could be strongly affected by the defects in go pei and cheng 2012 thus the electron transfer between go and nc may lead to the reduction of go as shown in fig s5 and table s2 go contained 77 32 c 1s 22 53 o 1s and 0 15 s 2p while nc included 65 72 c 1s 27 45 o 1s 2 04 n 1s 1 15 s 2p 0 07 f 1s and 3 57 heavy metals e g cr and ca limited amounts of n na and heavy metals were observed in the go nc hybrid as shown in fig 1j k and table s3 after the treatment with nc the content of c c 36 19 in the go nc significantly decreased moreover the contents of c o 18 86 and c n 16 42 significantly increased generally an increase in the nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups would expand the d spacing of graphene ali et al 2014 which is consistent with the alterations in the structure explained by the xrd analysis fig 1g 3 4 correlation analysis of the structural change in the go nc interaction to further probe the interaction mechanisms between go and nc synchronous fluorescence and ftir spectroscopies were used to probe the spectral changes of go during its interaction with the nc as shown in figs s6a and s6b three fluorescence regions at 240 300 300 380 and 380 500 nm were assigned to protein like fulvic like and humic like fluorescence fractions respectively the three fluorescence regions increased remarkably with the nc concentrations the ftir results were similar to that of synchronous fluorescence the ftir absorbance spectra and the differential ftir absorbance spectra were shown in fig s7a and fig s7b respectively the vibrational information on go backbones was identified at 750 1750 cm 1 the peaks corresponding to the skeletal vibrations of aromatic c c bonds shifted from 1620 to 1637 cm 1 after adsorption of nc onto go fig s7a which implied the occurrence of π π interactions between go and the aromatic structures of nc moreover at 0 30 mg l nc the characteristic peak at 1100 cm 1 assigned to the stretching vibrations of polysaccharide c o was initially narrowed and then broadened at higher concentrations 40 90 mg l of nc figs s7a s7b the broadening of the absorption band at the peak of 1100 cm 1 was probably due to the formation of c n bonds lin et al 2012 which was consistent with the xps results in fig 1k and table s3 to determine the conformational changes of go in the binding process with the nc 2dcos and hetero 2dcos analyses were performed using the synchronous fluorescence and ftir spectra as shown in fig 2 a two predominant autopeaks centered at 280 and 360 nm and a small peak at 410 nm increased remarkably from the cross peaks indicating the fluorescence of protein and fulvic like fractions bound to nc supported by the uv vis and epr spectra analysis fig 1h i the increase in the fulvic like fraction occurred because of intramolecular charge transfer interactions between aromatic structure donors and quinoid or other acceptors sharpless and blough 2014 the asynchronous map provided the sequential relationship among these fractions fig 2b the cross peaks 360 280 and 360 410 both exhibited positive signs indicating that the intensity variation followed the order 360 nm fulvic like fractions 280 nm protein like fractions 410 nm humic like fractions the fractions in nc played critical roles in the interactions between nc and go furthermore the synchronous and asynchronous 2d ircos maps of the interaction between the go and nc at various concentrations are shown in fig 2c and 2d respectively the sign and assignment of each cross peak in the synchronous and asynchronous maps are listed in table s4 six autopeaks 1650 1620 1560 1384 1100 and 830 cm 1 were observed in the synchronous and asynchronous map and most of the cross peaks were negative for example the band at 1100 cm 1 attributed to the c o of polysaccharides decreased most significantly this result was consistent with the xps results table s3 using the sequential order rules the structural change sequence of go backbones by nc binding followed the order c o of polysaccharides carboxyl aromatic νc c which implied that the binding affinities of hydrophilic sites were higher than those of hydrophobic sites the 2d ftir cos results suggested that not only the fluorescent groups but also some nonfluorescent groups such as polysaccharides and aromatic structure of the go were involved in the binding process of the nc with go to determine the correlation between the fluorescence and ftir spectra a fluorescence ir hetero 2dcos analysis was performed as shown in fig 2e and 2f in the synchronous map fig 2e five cross peaks were located observably in the ftir regions of 1100 1384 1560 1620 and 1650 cm 1 and the corresponding fluorescence region of 360 nm the cross peaks of 1100 and 1384 cm 1 with 360 nm were negative while the others were positive the band centered at 1100 cm 1 polysaccharide νc o and 1384 cm 1 phenolic νc o with 360 nm changed most significantly thus indicating that the carboxyl phenolic and polysaccharide groups of nc were the basic fluorescence units for the fulvic like fraction these hydrophilic groups were involved in the interactions between the nc and go for the asynchronous map fig 2f a cross peak at 1620 cm 1 aromatic νc c with a fluorescence peak at 340 420 nm were observed implying that a π π interaction occurred and promoted nc binding to go 3 5 affinity between nc and go to confirm and quantitatively analyze the binding affinities between go and nc a bli experiment was conducted as illustrated in fig 3 as shown fig 3a go could form a stable layer on the surface of the aps sensor tip and then the go aps sensors were incubated with a different concentration gradient of nc to measure the corresponding association and dissociation signals according to the raw bli data fig 3b the classic association dissociation curves of the binding of nc onto go are shown in fig 3c the results of fig 3a c in details were provided in the si the calculated average values of on rate kon and off rate koff were 2 7 104 1 ms and 1 5 10 4 1 s respectively moreover fig 3c exhibited a good association and dissociation kinetics correlation coefficient r2 0 99 indicated the effective binding of nc as evident from the go aps tips and the affinity constant kd the ratio of koff to kon was 5 6 nm indicating a high binding affinity of nc to go the lower kd values reflected larger binding affinities barba spaeth et al 2016 the affinity of the nc to go was notably greater than that of certain blood proteins e g transferrin kd 3660 nm chong et al 2015 and high molecular weight ha 576 nm 3351 nm to go zhou et al 2019 the amounts of nc adsorbed onto go were determined based on the uv vis absorbance abs200 and the calibration curve between abs200 and the nc concentration is presented in fig s8 after reaching adsorption equilibrium the mixed suspension was centrifuged 14 000 g 15 min and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane consequently the both go or go nc 0 22 μm was all removed and did not affect the determination of nc at abs200 as shown in fig 4 a c and table s5 the adsorption of the nc to go was dependent on both time and concentration the adsorption of the nc on go increased rapidly in the initial 1 h and reached an adsorption equilibrium in approximately 4 h fig 4a the rapid sorption of the nc onto go was fitted by the pseudo first order pseudo second order and ipdm models fig 4a b and the kinetic parameters were presented in table s5 for all the adsorption models the correlation coefficients for pseudo first order model r2 0 984 were relatively higher than those of the pseudo second order r2 0 970 and ipdm r2 0 856 indicating that both flat surface adsorption and rate limiting mechanisms were important in the adsorption process of nc onto go moreover the ipdm modeling was used to elucidate the rate limiting step of the adsorption fig 4b the regression of q versus t1 2 was linear but the c value 9 7 1 4 mg g did not pass through the origin c was not equal to zero table s5 indicating that the adsorption process involved intraparticle diffusion and other rate limiting steps wang et al 2016 in addition to flat surface adsorption the rate limiting step for the adsorption of nc after 100 min should be attributed to intraparticle diffusion in the adsorption on go occurring mainly in scroll morphology or multiple go particles structure formed by nc the adsorption capacities of the nc on go were further confirmed as shown in fig 4c as the binding process of the nc onto go reached equilibrium within 120 240 min fig 4a the adsorption capacity of the go for nc was approximately 159 8 5 2 mg g the adsorption capacity of the nc was higher than that of ha 69 0 mg g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons molecules 2 62 6 12 mg g and heavy metal ion such as cd ii 106 3 mg g and co ii 68 2 mg g and cu ii 11 4 mg g on go lee et al 2015 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2011 3 6 nc promote the dispersity of go in water the aggregation profiles of the go in the presence nc are shown in fig 4d the initial dh of go was approximately 250 nm and then increased rapidly to approximately 800 nm at 1500 s indicating the instability of go moreover values of the aggregation rate constant kα were used to normalize the aggregation kinetics of go as shown in fig s9 the kα value of pristine go in milli q water was 0 523 nm s while the kα of go decreased to 0 458 and 0 304 nm s in the presence of nc at levels of 0 1 and 10 mg l respectively overall the go dispersity was improved significantly as the nc concentration increased from 0 1 to 10 mg l which was similar to that in the presence of ha divalent cations and organic macromolecules produced by organisms e g alginate the kα value of go in the presence of nc was lower than that in the presence of metal cations approximately 0 7 nm s chowdhury et al 2013 the above kα value was higher than that in the presence of ha or alginate approximately 0 3 nm s and bovine serum albumin bsa which had virtually no effect on go aggregation feng et al 2019 moreover the influence of nc on the sedimentation of go were also investigated as shown in fig 4e apparent aggregates were not observed before 4 h while visible aggregates appeared at the bottom of the suspensions and the color turned dark brown from light brown over time denoted by the red box the precipitation in fig 4e was consistent with the observed adsorption kinetics shown in fig 4a the free nc were removed by washing with mill q water in addition the residual nc did not affect the measurement of the upper go concentration at 280 nm because the absorbance of nc at 280 nm was much weaker than that of go 0 016 vs 0 138 thus the concentration c of go in the upper suspension was determined based on the uv vis absorbance at 280 nm abs280 the calibration curve between abs280 values and go concentrations is presented in fig s10 the ratio of the upper go concentration to the initial go concentration c c0 decreased with the sedimentation time fig 4f the rates of sedimentation for go nc were smaller than those of go alone the sedimentation rate was approximately 0 0125 mg h for go at 10 mg l nc go nc concentration ratio 1 which was remarkably lower than that of go with cations e g ca2 and na or ha castro et al 2018 chowdhury et al 2015 after 24 h 78 7 8 mg l and 85 8 5 mg l of go the initial concentration was 10 mg l remained suspended in the presence of nc at 1 and 10 mg l respectively fig 4f thus nc at environmentally relevant concentrations promoted the dispersity of go in water once release into aquatic environments go was likely to interact with nc a possible aggregation sedimentation processes during go nc interaction was bridging go bridging caused flocculation with ha and then go settled out from water yang et al 2013 the afm fig 1b and tem fig 1d results showed that go might transform into multiple go particles bridging by nc the present work also found that the dh of go increased in the presence of nc fig 4d and the flocculation of go with nc settled out after 6 h fig 4e moreover nc adsorption on go via electron charge transfer π π stacking interactions and hydrophilic effects as described above leading to the improvement of the stability of go sheets electrostatic repulsion was a major driving force preventing the go from aggregating zhao et al 2014 the charge repulsions may overcome the aggregation of go by nc with negative charges in addition the hydrophobicity of go was another important factor for go dispersion in aquatic environments it was reported that organic macromolecules such as ha bovine bsa and alginate could reduce go sedimentation feng et al 2019 similarly nc also exhibited a good dispersion performance toward go through hydrophilic effects 3 7 nc mitigate the toxicity on zebrafish embryo induced by go as presented above nc remarkably affect the physicochemical properties of go in water although the environmental risks in association with go remain unknown to explore the effects of nc on the go risk zebrafish were exposed to nc at a concentration of 4 mg l environmental concentrations 3 88 0 52 mg l listed in table s1 and go from 0 01 mg l to 1 mg l compared to the control fig 5 a at 96 hpf nc 4 mg l exposure resulted in distinct tail malformations denoted by the red arrows as shown in fig 5b while the yolk sac edema denoted by the green arrows of zebrafish larvae were significantly induced by go exposure at 1 mg l fig 5c interestingly the above distinct malformations in zebrafish embryos were alleviated at go 1 mg l plus nc 4 mg l co exposure fig 5d as shown in fig 5e the mortality rate in nc go and go nc exposure groups were approximately 15 4 15 4 and 24 1 respectively and all nanoparticles exposure groups were significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the control group 9 2 moreover the addition of nc significantly p 0 05 reduced the mortality rates induced by go at 0 1 mg l and 1 mg l similar results were observed for the malformations in fig 5f g comparing to the nc or go group alone the malformations in go nc co exposure group significantly p 0 05 decreased fig 5f g for example go nc did not induce obvious occurrences of tail malformations our previous reports found zebrafish exhibited remarkable developmental toxicity after trace go 0 001 0 1 mg l exposure zhang et al 2017 small size of nc containing trace heavy metals such as cr fig s2 could exhibited severe growth inhibition and oxidative stress on chlorella vulgaris after exposure to nc 0 72 36 mg l ouyang et al 2018 the antagonism effects of zebrafish developmental toxicity after go co exposure with nc deserve much attention oxidative stress is one of the identified teratogenic mechanisms in fish zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 5h and fig s11 the relative ros fluorescence intensity for go at 1 mg l and nc at 4 mg l was 37 1 and 28 4 higher than the control respectively in contrast co exposure of go nc alleviated the oxidative stress induced by go or nc being consistent with the zebrafish developmental toxicity results fig 5a g the mechanisms of the decrease in ros induced by go upon interactions with nc were complicated thicker scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc was observed in fig 1b and 1d thicker multiple layer go sheets induced lower intracellular oxidative stress zhao et al 2014 thicker scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc was formed as shown in fig 1b and d moreover the organic matters e g ha could passivate go and reduce the ros levels chen et al 2015 nc containing lots of organic matters may play the similar passivation against ros in addition the increase of the id ig ratio from raman spectra fig 1f and red shifting of go in uv vis spectra fig 1h supported the reduction of go go induced greater intracellular oxidative stress than reduced go hashemi et al 2014 moreover the uptake and distribution of nanoparticles may directly alter the effects on zebrafish embryo developmental toxicity and oxidative stress seabra et al 2014 as described below 3 8 nc regulate the uptake and distribution of go in vivo the uptake and translocation of nc go and go nc were detected using confocal fluorescence microscope as shown in fig 6 for the control group fig 6a a notable blue fluorescence signal was not observed in contrast blue fluorescence signals were observed in all exposure groups fig 6b d indicating that nc and go nc were present near the heart and yolk sac and the aortic blood and intestines in contrast the heart yolk sac and intestines were the main locations of the go in zebrafish fig 6c in fig 6e the relative blue fluorescence intensity was used to analyze the uptake and distribution of nanoparticles in the zebrafish for all exposure groups the mean fluorescence intensities of the heart and intestines were higher than that of the total body the blue fluorescence intensities of zebrafish exposed to a go suspension were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the control group e3 the fluorescence intensity of aortic blood significantly p 0 05 increased in both the nc and go nc groups suggesting that nc and go nc could enter the blood circulation the intestinal tract was the main pathway by which zebrafish larvae uptake nanoparticles brun et al 2018 interestingly the fluorescence intensity of go nc groups were significantly p 0 05 lower than that of nc groups suggesting that the uptake of go reduced in zebrafish larvae when go was adsorbed to nc similar trends were also observed in the fluorescence intensities of the heart and yolk sac the physicochemical properties of go in aquatic environment affected their bioavailability and toxicity to aquatic organisms go tended to form a stable colloid dispersion avoiding aggregation and sedimentation and was easy to be internalized and removed from the biological body seabra et al 2014 after binding to nc go nc presented smaller size fig 1b and 1d and higher hydrophilic than go thus the hydrophilic go nc sheets could be readily excreted from zebrafish larva physical damage from nanomaterials was an important reason for nanotoxicity de planque et al 2011 the sharp edges of go induced physical damage to cells akhavan and ghaderi 2010 therefore nc could reduce the bioavailability of go and direct interaction with zebrafish larva and then resulted in the mitigation of the developmental toxicity and oxidative stress of zebrafish embryo 4 conclusions in the present study the multiple analytical methods e g bli and 2dcos revealed that the nc exhibited a high binding affinity onto go via hydrophilic effects electron charge transfers and π π stacking interactions nc adsorption also promoted the dispersity of go in water after binding to nc the properties e g morphology and structure of go changed morphology was a critical factor that affected graphene nanotoxicity hu et al 2015 the pristine go was transformed into a scroll morphology or multiple go particles bridging by nc and the thickness of go increased as described in fig 1b and 1d compared to the thin of pristine go the thicker multiple go nc induced lower intracellular oxidative stress fig 5h moreover treated go nc had a smaller size and higher hydrophilic groups could be readily removed from zebrafish larva reducing the bioavailability of go it is important to consider the systematic effects of these properties and environmental behaviors when assessing the health risks of go overall the co exposure of go nc resulted in markedly reduced zebrafish embryo toxicity compared with the go or nc alone due to the effects on nanoparticle uptake and distribution in vivo and reduction of oxidative stress given the obvious roles of nc in the morphology aggregation and toxicity of go the present work shows that the environmental risks of enps in water should be reexamined declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

18516,stormwater biofilters have been increasingly used to mitigate the impact of climate change on the export of contaminants including nitrate to water bodies yet their performance is rarely tested under high intensity rainfall events which are predicted to occur more frequently under climate change scenarios we examined the potential of biochar to improve the resilience of woodchip biofilters under simulated high intensity rainfall events and linked denitrification to biochar mediated changes in hydrological physical chemical and biological properties of woodchip biofilters results showed that nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters decreased with increases in rainfall intensity or duration and decreases in antecedent drying time however adding biochar to woodchips significantly decreased the exhaustion rate of woodchips only when the hydraulic residence time hrt was less than 5 h at longer hrt 5 h the benefits of biochar became less apparent we attributed the improved denitrification during high nitrate loading to biochar s ability to decrease dissolved oxygen in pore water and increase water holding capacity and retention of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate all of which could increase nitrate utilization biochar increased the net microbial biomass but did not affect the relative abundance of denitrifying genes which indicates that a shift in microbial biomass could not fully explain the observed increase in nitrate removal in biochar augmented woodchip biofilters overall the results showed that biochar could increase the resiliency of woodchip biofilters for denitrification in high intensity rainfall events a worst case scenario thereby mitigating the water quality degradation during climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification climate change impact low impact development eutrophication extreme rainfall bioinfiltration systems 1 introduction eutrophication or algal blooms are expected to intensify during climate change partly due to an increasing frequency of high intensity rainfall these climate driven changes increase the conveyance of nutrients to water bodies and warm surface waters which accelerates algal growth whitehead et al 2009 in particular rainfall intensity can be a critical indicator of nutrient pollution because runoff generated during high intensity rainfall disproportionally exports more nutrient per runoff volume to surface waters than runoff generated during low intensity rainfall michalak et al 2013 jenny et al 2016 to treat runoff low impact development infrastructure such as biofilters have been increasingly incorporated into urban and agricultural landscapes yet the performance of these natural treatment systems is rarely tested under high intensity rainfall events norton et al 2017 the resilience of a treatment system can be indicated by the number of events in which the treatment system fails to remove specific pollutants to below a desired standard or by the duration it takes to restore the removal rate after a failure has occurred juan garcía et al 2017 therefore it is critical to evaluate the impact of high intensity rainfall on nitrate removal potential of conventional biofilters and improve their design to increase their resilience passive treatment systems such as stormwater biofilters offer cost effective solutions to treat nitrate in runoff originated from nonpoint sources biofilters are typically designed by replacing a portion of surface soil with soil amendments that serve multiple functions to increase stormwater infiltration to remove pollutants and to support plants growth for nitrate removal carbon amendments such as woodchips sawdust and crop residues are typically used shrestha et al 2018 jia et al 2019 these amendments release dissolved organic carbon doc which the denitrifying microbial communities use as an electron donor to reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas via a series of intermediate steps ambus and zechmeister boltenstern 2007 among these amendments woodchips are popular bruun et al 2016 hoover et al 2016 because they typically last longer and consistently provide doc lopez ponnada et al 2017 for efficient denitrification four conditions should be met 1 dissolved oxygen do concentration should be low preferably below 3 mg l 1 as high do can deactivate the enzymes involved in denitrification gómez et al 2002 2 a sufficient amount of doc must be present newcomer et al 2012 3 the conditions in biofilters should favor growth of denitrifying microorganisms falkentoft et al 2000 4 the hydraulic retention time hrt should be low enough for maximum utilization of nitrate by microorganisms damaraju et al 2015 hoover et al 2016 halaburka et al 2017 thus the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters is sensitive to rainfall characteristics and antecedent weather conditions lynn et al 2015 which may affect all four of the conditions for denitrification rainfall characteristics are expected to change with climate change in particular high intensity rainfall and prolonged dry periods are projected to occur more frequently ipcc 2007 prein et al 2017 which may decrease the denitrification potential of woodchip based biofilters biofilters typically bypass water when the runoff loading rate exceeds the maximum infiltration capacity of the biofilter but woodchip biofilters have high hydraulic conductivity due to large pore sizes thus hrt of the biofilter under high intensity rainfall event could decrease rapidly however most studies with woodchip biofilters damaraju et al 2015 hoover et al 2016 halaburka et al 2017 examined their performance at long hrt 48 h and under steady state condition thereby overestimating denitrifying capacities of woodchip biofilters most stormwater biofilters are passive and subjected to an unsteady condition when nitrate concentration in pore water is expected to change because of either high loading during high intensity rainfall or no loading during antecedent dry conditions while high loading can decrease nitrate removal antecedent drying could increase nitrate removal lynn et al 2015 wang et al 2018 thus the overall performance of woodchip biofilters under unsteady conditions is unclear to increase the resiliency of woodchip biofilters under heavy rainfall conditions biochar a porous black carbon produced by pyrolysis of organic materials can be added to biofilters the effect of biochar on nitrate removal capacity of stormwater biofilters has been reported to vary widely see review by mohanty et al 2018 but the cause of the wide variation is unclear biochar can alter physical chemical and biological processes in the soil but how these changes can affect denitrification is not well understood bock et al 2016 2018 while some studies have demonstrated that biochar addition can improve nitrate removal by increasing storage volume and residence time bock et al 2015 or by shrinking of the denitrifying microbial community chen et al 2015 others have shown contrasting results including the release of nitrate into infiltrating water sarkhot et al 2013 the objective of this study is to link the nitrate removal capacity of biochar augmented woodchip biofilters under unsteady flow conditions to biochar mediated alteration in physical chemical and biological properties of the biofilter we compared the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters with and without biochar amendments under simulated rainfall events with increasing intensities and antecedent drying durations 2 materials and methods 2 1 stormwater stormwater was collected twice a week in 20 l hpde plastic carboys from ballona creek in los angeles ca 34 0 36 n 118 23 29 w which receives dry weather irrigation runoff from a 318 km2 urban area with 82 developed and 61 impervious surface gold et al 2015 stormwater was characterized for ph do and turbidity within 1 h of the sample collection large particulates were removed from stormwater by gravitational settling for 1 h and the supernatant was stored up to 1 2 days in a refrigerator at 4 c to minimize bacterial growth before injection stormwater was warmed to room temperature 23 c and concentrated nitrate stock solution was spiked to 18 l of stormwater to achieve a targeted initial nitrate concentration of 20 2 mg l 1 2 2 biofilter media pine woodchips without chemical treatment whittier fertilizer company ca were sieved sieve 20 to remove woodchips larger than 1 27 cm we used commercially available biochar biochar supreme everson wa which has been demonstrated to remove heavy metals and organic contaminants from stormwater miles et al 2016 the biochar produced by high temperature 900 1000 c gasification of a softwood has following characteristics high bet surface area 690 720 m2 g based on nitrogen adsorption low ash content 4 and low moisture content 10 both woodchips and biochar were dried in an oven at 80 c until the dry weight of the media remained constant oven drying was necessary to kill most of the bacteria from woodchips and biochar this permits us to compare the microbial community developed in columns with and without biochar biochar was mixed with woodchips to prepare woodchip biochar mixtures 5 10 and 20 biochar by volume woodchips without biochar were used as a control media 2 3 biofilter media characterization the particle size distribution of the biochar was determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer model ls 13 320 beckman coulter brea ca usa for woodchips the size distribution was determined using an optoelectronic particle size analyzer model camsizer retsch technology gmbh germany d10 d50 and d90 of woodchips were 3 7 8 4 and 13 3 mm respectively d10 d50 and d90 of biochars were 0 02 0 7 and 1 7 mm respectively fig s1 after experiments saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in all columns using the falling head method the water retention characteristics of the woodchips and woodchips biochar mixtures were determined using a benchtop instrument ums hyprop meter group inc pullman wa the hyprop measures the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity based on the evaporation method by simultaneously recording the sample weight and soil matric potential during the sample drying cycle from saturation to around pf 2 5 pf is the log10 h where h is the suction in cm which is below wilting point we utilized the bimodal soil water retention model durner 1994 which is ideal to describe changes in physical properties of a medium having a heterogeneous pore structure in this case the water retention curve is expressed as a linear superposition of sub curves of a homogeneous pore structure using a unimodal model van genuchten 1980 and effective saturation was estimated using the equation below s e w 1 1 1 1 h n 1 m 1 1 w 1 1 1 2 h n 2 m 2 where s e is effective saturation w 1 is the weighing factor for the first subcurve subject to 0 wi 1 is a scaling factor that determines the position of the pore size maximum h is the suction cm n and m empirical shape parameters and m 1 1 n s e is related to volumetric water content as θ θ r θ s θ r s e where θ is the volumetric water content θ s is saturated and θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 the model was implemented using a nonlinear fitting program seki 2007 and the modeled water retention curve was fitted with experimental data using the derived parameters the details of the method were described in a previous study trifunovic et al 2018 it should be noted that drying of biochar in the oven may have removed moisture from micropores or nanopores which likely reduced the amount of intraparticle pore space that could be wet nevertheless multiple rewetting cycles prior to the experiment is expected to refill some of the pores 2 4 biofilter design to examine the effect of biochar concentration on denitrification potential of woodchip biofilters woodchips without control and with biochar at 5 10 or 20 by volume were packed in plastic columns 5 cm inner diameter 61 cm length and fittings made up off polyvinyl chloride pvc triplicate columns were used for each mixture fig s2 to create a drainage layer gravel was first filled in bottom 5 cm layer a nylon screen 100 μm pore size was placed on the top of the gravel to prevent washout of biochar particulates about 100 g of woodchips or woodchip biochar mixture was added and compacted at 5 cm incremental heights until the total filter media depth was 45 7 cm gravel was added on the top of the filter layer to prevent suspension of biochar particles a submerged layer was created by raising the outlet 30 5 cm above the top surface of the bottom gravel layer all columns were wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent algal growth to displace air from pores in the submerged layer deionized di was injected from the bottom up flow until the filter media layer was completely submerged once the submerged layer was established stormwater was applied on the top of the filter media using a peristaltic pump and the effluent was collected at regular intervals through the raised outlet using 300 ml amber bottles the effective pore volume of each column was estimated based on the volume of water required to achieve 50 of the concentration of influent bromide a conservative tracer method details in supplementary material total pore volume measured by the bromide breakthrough curve does not account for the intraparticle pore volume where bromide transport is diffusion limited thus estimated pore volume only represents the pores or flow paths through which stormwater infiltrated during the experiment 2 5 nitrate removal experiments because both woodchips and biochar were oven dried before the experiment they were expected to have a limited microbial activity to grow biofilms or denitrifying communities the columns were first conditioned by applying stormwater on the top of columns periodically 0 4 d for three months following conditioning of the columns stormwater spiked with nitrate was applied on the top of the columns at a specific rate to simulate different rainfall intensities effluents were collected at regular intervals 0 5 pore volume fraction in 300 ml amber bottles and analyzed for nitrate do ph and uv254 absorbance an indicator of doc concentration in pore water to determine the effect of rainfall duration on nitrate removal stormwater with 24 7 mg l 1 nitrate was injected at 18 5 cm h 1 for 12 h following 4 days of antecedent drying effluents were collected at 1 h intervals and selected samples 1 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 h were analyzed for nitrate and other water quality parameters to examine the effect of rainfall intensity and antecedent drying duration on nitrate removal in biochar augmented woodchip biofilters contaminated stormwater was applied at a specific rate ranging between 19 and 296 mm h 1 to test the changes in nitrate removal during rapid infiltration of stormwater 1 2 l of stormwater containing nitrate was injected through each column at 5 rainfall intensities varying from 19 mm h 1 to 296 mm h 1 which correspond to hrt between 16 6 0 5 to 1 04 0 03 h hrt was calculated by dividing the pore volume of each column type estimated from bromide breakthrough data fig s3 by infiltration rate through pores infiltration rate was assumed to be the discharge rate at the bottom which was observed to be same as rainfall application rate to examine the effect of antecedent drying duration on denitrification stormwater with nitrate was applied at 148 mm h 1 for 4 h on biofilters subjected to first increasing and then decreasing antecedent drying duration in the following order 1 2 4 8 30 8 4 2 and 1 day 2 6 water sample characterization effluents and influents were analyzed immediately after the experiment for the following water quality parameters ph fisher scientific 9107bn do fisher scientific 087010md and uv254 absorbance perkinelmer lambda 365 uv visible spectrophotometer uv absorbance was used as a surrogate measurement for dissolved organic carbon assuming specific uv absorbance of doc leached from woodchips remained constant during the experimental period abusallout and hua 2017 uv absorbance and nitrate concentrations were measured in samples centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min to remove particulates or bacteria following centrifugation the supernatant was acidified ph 3 and stored at 4 c to minimize any microbial activity the samples were analyzed for nitrate concentration using ion chromatography dionex integrion hpic thermoscientific within 1 2 days of sample storage 2 7 modeling exhaustion rate of woodchip biofilters during intermittent rainfall events with high intensity rainfall nitrate loading rate can exceed the nitrate removal rate of woodchip biofilters thus effluent nitrate concentration is expected to rise rapidly due to exhaustion of the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilter to estimate the rate at which the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters was exhausted with an increase in nitrate loading contaminated water volume during high intensity rainfall we used the following model to describe the concentration of nitrate in pore water d c d v k c 0 c where c and c 0 are effluent and influent nitrate concentrations respectively k is exhaustion rate v is the volume of stormwater passed through the columns the model assumes that change in concentration in woodchip biofilters is a function of the difference in nitrate concentrations between pore water and influent water solving the first order linear differential equation supporting material the effluent concentration can be expressed as c c 0 1 e k v nitrate removal 1 c c 0 was calculated for each column type at all intervals the exhaustion rate was calculated based on the exponential fit of the data showing a decrease in removal with increases in nitrate loading pore volume to compare the total removal of nitrate in a rainfall event as a function of antecedent drying duration we calculated the ratio of the total mass of nitrate removed i c i v i and total mass of nitrate injected c 0 i v i during a rainfall event where i is sample number all samples were collected and analyzed for nitrate concentration to complete the mass balance 2 8 denitrifying functional gene analysis after the experiment columns were dismantled to remove media mixture from the center of the column the total nucleic acids were extracted from the 10 g media mixture using dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen and the concentration of extracts was measured on nanodrop nd 2000 nanodrop technologies willmington de usa target genes encoding nitrate reductases napa and narg and nitrite reductases nirk and nirs were amplified using real time quantitative polymerase chain reactions qpcr conducted on a steponeplus thermocycler life technologies carlsbad ca the primer sets for each denitrifying functional genes and details methodology were described in a previous study miao et al 2018 the qpcr reaction system was 20 μl which included 2 luminaris color higreen hirox qpcr master mix 10 μl thermo scientific waltham ma 0 25 μm forward and reverse primers 0 5 μl with 10 μm 2 μl of dna 5 20 ng μl 1 templates and 7 μl double distilled water the cycling program for each target gene started with 95 c for 5 min ran for 40 cycles with respective annealing temperatures table s1 all reactions had the amplifying efficiency from 85 to 97 accompanied by a melt curve analysis to confirm the specificity of qpcr products the gene copies numbers in each sample were normalized to the total weight of biochar woodchip samples 10 g with units of copies g 1 2 9 statistical analysis statistical analysis of data anova and tukey hsd was performed using r v3 4 pearson correlation was used to evaluate if an increase in the addition of biochar to woodchip biofilters resulted in changes in nitrate removal capacity exhaustion rate 16s rrna and functional gene abundances differences were considered significant at a p value less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 effect of biochar amendment on hydraulic properties of woodchip biofilters based on bromide tracer study the pore volume of columns with 0 5 10 and 20 biochar by volume were estimated to be 649 1 64 8 623 4 10 8 616 0 34 0 and 607 8 23 2 ml respectively fig s3 thus the addition of biochar did not significantly p 0 05 alter the pore volume of woodchip biofilters saturated hydraulic conductivity of woodchip columns decreased with increases in biochar fraction saturated hydraulic conductivities of woodchip columns with 0 5 10 and 20 biochar by volume were 6048 1080 5364 936 2304 864 and 1476 72 mm h 1 respectively fig s4 although the addition of biochar 20 decreased hydraulic conductivity of woodchip columns by 75 the hydraulic conductivity was still more than five times the observed infiltration rates the infiltration rates were measured based on the discharge rate volume of stormwater collected in each sample divided by sampling time difference between discharge rates from columns with and without biochar was insignificant p 0 5 soil water retention curves of woodchips with and without biochar showed that the addition of biochar increased the water holding capacity of woodchips fig 1 addition of biochar to woodchips increased water retention in macropores and decreased water retention in micropores 3 2 effect of biochar addition on pore water chemistry in woodchip biofilters biochar addition affected effluent water chemistry including ph do and uv254 absorbance fig s5 effluent ph from all columns remained consistent at 7 5 0 1 irrespective of biochar fractions and stormwater application rates or hydraulic residence time hrt in all columns effluent do decreased from 9 2 0 4 mg l 1 influent to 3 3 4 9 mg l 1 as more stormwater passed through the columns however the lowest effluent do value depended on hrt the effluent do decreased with increases in hrt up to 18 h any further increase in hrt did not decrease do any further addition of biochar appears to decrease do in pore water the uv absorbance of effluents an indicator of doc leaching from the system in columns typically decreased with increases in biochar fraction and decreases in hrt drying duration changed the pore water chemistry fig s6 comparing changes in porewater chemistry of the effluent before and after drying we showed that an increase in drying duration decreased do of pore water addition of biochar resulted in greater do removal for 1 2 and 4 d drying but not for 8 d increasing drying duration increased uv254 absorbance of effluents across all columns indicating an increase in doc concentration in the pore water during drying in general woodchip columns without biochar had pore water with the highest uv254 absorbance or doc concentration 3 3 effect of biochar fraction and stormwater loading on nitrate removal nitrate removal decreased with increases in the applied volume of stormwater or nitrate loading fig 2 the model fits the decrease in removal capacity of biofilters comparing the nitrate removal capacity worst case scenario of all columns at the end of the experiment we estimated that biochar amended columns can treat at least 25 more stormwater than biochar free woodchip biofilters before being exhausted to the same level of effluent nitrate concentration 3 4 effect of infiltration velocity on nitrate removal nitrate removal decreased with increasing infiltration velocity which increases with an increase in rainfall intensity fig 3 nitrate was completely removed 100 in all columns at low infiltration rates 19 and 37 mm h 1 with increases in infiltration velocity nitrate removal declined a decrease in nitrate removal with an increase in contaminated stormwater exposure is defined as the rate of exhaustion k of the nitrate removal capacity of biofilters the exhaustion rate decreased with increases in biochar fraction fig 4 a although the positive impact of biochar was significant p 0 05 when the infiltration rate was 146 mm h 1 or higher at low infiltration rate nitrate was completely removed or no exhaustion in all columns irrespective of biochar fractions 3 5 effect of drying duration on nitrate removal increase in antecedent drying duration before stormwater application decreased p 0 05 the rate at which nitrate removal capacity of columns was exhausted during stormwater application fig 4 increase in biochar fraction decreased the exhaustion in nitrate removal capacity increases in antecedent drying duration increased nitrate removal for all columns irrespective of biochar content fig 5 3 6 effect of biochar percentage on bacterial functional gene abundance an increase in biochar fraction in the woodchip column was associated with increased total 16s rna copy numbers coefficient 0 989 p value 0 05 table s2 but did not have any significant p 0 05 effect on the relative abundance of denitrifying genes including napa and narg fig 6 during incubation the total bacterial population had grown which was originally at 107 and 104 copies g 1 on woodchips and biochar respectively among the functional genes napa narg and nirk showed significantly positive correlations with each other table s2 demonstrating their potential critical functions in the columns 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rainfall characteristics and antecedent drying on nitrate removal in biofilters in nature heavy rainfall events deliver more nitrogen than smaller events higashino and stefan 2014 jones et al 2018 intense rainfall events increase not only the runoff volume that create ponding but also the infiltration rate by increasing the moisture content of the filter layer we found that both factors longer duration of an infiltration event with infiltration above a threshold value and high infiltration rate decreased the nitrate removal capacity of woodchips biofilters the removal was high initially 2 pv injection due to the mixing of contaminated stormwater with less contaminated pore water remained in the submerged zone during antecedent dry periods wang et al 2018 this result indicates that the performance of biofilter where hrt of stormwater is low 5 h can be highly variable depending on the volume of stormwater passing through the biofilter during a rainfall volume of stormwater runoff depends on rainfall intensity and characteristics of the catchment area that contributes to the runoff volume thus biofilter size and thickness of the filter layer should be determined during design based on the catchment characteristics and historic and projected precipitation pattern comparing average nitrate removal with increases in hrt we found that nitrate removal decreased with decreases in hrt up to a certain critical value fig s8 however when hrt was longer than 18 h nitrate removal did not change because the removal was at its maximum capacity 100 the lowest removal was observed in woodchip columns at hrt 1 13 h at lower hrt 5 h which applies to most passive stormwater biofilter nitrate removal was higher in biochar augmented woodchip biofilters than woodchips only biofilters we estimated that hrt was a function of infiltration rate not biochar fraction addition of biochar did not change hrt significantly p 0 05 thus a difference in nitrate removal between columns with and without biochar at high infiltration rate excluded hrt as a potential cause of increased nitrate removal in biochar columns this result indicates that a change in hrt by addition of biochar could not explain observed improvements in nitrate removal 4 2 effect of antecedent drying on nitrate removal in biofilters with climate change the frequency of persistent dry condition is expected to increase our results showed that increases in drying duration could be beneficial for nitrate removal in biofilters with a submerged layer as observed in other studies lynn et al 2015 wang et al 2018 we attributed the positive impact of drying duration to changes in favorable pore water chemistry during drying periods do concentration decreased and uv254 nm absorbance of pore water increased during drying increase in uv absorbance of pore water after drying suggests that an increase in drying duration caused more doc to leach into pore water however it should be noted that drying did not affect the moisture content in the submerged layer the layer that potentially removes most nitrate thus doc increased during drying duration because of accumulation of leached doc in pore water over a long period addition of biochar retained doc leached from woodchips during drying conditions and helped remove nitrogen trapped inside the pores 4 3 effect of biochar fraction on nitrate removal addition of biochar to woodchip biofilters improved their nitrate removal capacity and the effect was more apparent when the fraction of biochar added was 10 by volume or greater overall biochar amended woodchip biofilters treated more stormwater than woodchip only biofilters until the effluent concentration reached a similar value because mean pore volumes of biochar amended columns were similar p 0 05 to pore volume of woodchip biofilters pore volume did not explain an increase in nitrate removal in biochar amended columns biochar could occupy the void spaces between woodchips and can decrease the porosity similar to how it was observed in a recent study that used a mixture of coarse sand and biochar trifunovic et al 2018 the positive effect of biochar on denitrification was more apparent at lower hrt 5 h this result confirmed that biochar addition could improve nitrate removal in one of the worst case conditions high loading during high intensity rainfall events thereby contributing to an increase in resilience of woodchip biofilters 4 4 cause of increased resilience of woodchip biofilter following biochar addition our results showed that denitrification capacity of woodchip biofilters decreased under high intensity rainfall events and that the addition of biochar could mitigate this concern an increase in the denitrification capacity of woodchip biofilters by biochar can be attributed to three factors 1 changes in hydraulic properties of a filter layer that increase the contact time of contaminated water 2 changes in pore water chemistry that favor denitrification and 3 increase in microbial biomass that enhances denitrification addition of biochar increased net biomass but did not significantly affect denitrifying genes a lack of correlation between biochar fraction and denitrifying genes suggests that denitrifying genes concentration did not increase despite an increase in the concentration of biomass after biochar addition thus biomass increase should not be used as an indicator of the denitrifying potential of woodchips biofilters biochar affected the hydraulic and pore water chemical properties of woodchip biofilters and consequently affected contaminated water availability and efficiency of the microbial communities to carry out denitrification processes the mean pore volume estimated by bromide tracer did not significantly change due to biochar addition however bromide concentration in the effluent reflected bulk pore water concentration which typically is affected by advection reedy et al 1996 it does not account for the water within the diffusion dominated intraparticle pore space where a temporal change in concentration of bromide or any dissolved solute could be slow due to slow transport of solute by diffusion water retention curves of woodchips with and without biochar showed that the addition of biochar increased water retention in macropore and mesopore regions we attribute this result to the formation of intra particle macro or mesoporosity sun and lu 2014 thus the volume of immobile water could increase due to the addition of biochar which could trap doc leached from woodchips because bacteria concentration is expected to be higher near the surface than the bulk liquid due to biofilm formation increase in the concentration of doc or nitrate in diffusion dominated intraparticle pore space increases utilization of doc and consequently the removal of nitrate biochar also shifted the dominant pore sizes for water retention from micropores to macropores microbial communities typically utilize nutrients trapped in macropores or pores larger than their size thus water retention in larger pores could have contributed to increasing microbial utilization of nitrate in columns with biochar biochar altered the chemical properties of pore water increased retention of doc and decreased do a decrease in do an inhibitor for denitrification can help denitrification similarly retention of doc in biofilters or decreasing the loss of doc into infiltration stormwater could increase their utilization for denitrification a high concentration of doc near the surface of biochar or woodchips could increase the kinetics of denitrification that highly depends on the concentration of dissolved organic carbon hartz et al 2017 biochar could trap doc in pore water or in the thin film near its surface which can be utilized by the microbial community ulrich et al 2017 thus we conclude that biochar mediated alteration of the physical and chemical properties of biofilters creates more beneficial conditions for the denitrifying activity although the microbial community remained unchanged 5 conclusion our results showed that increases in rainfall intensity and duration decrease nitrate removal in the woodchip biofilter but the addition of biochar could improve its nitrate removal capacity by altering water holding capacity of the biofilter and chemical properties of pore water specific conclusions of this study are increases in storm duration or stormwater loading decreased nitrate removal in the woodchip biofilters due to exhaustion of their removal capacity increases in rainfall intensity decreased hydraulic residence time and decreased in nitrate removal at high intensity rainfall the decrease in nitrate removal is attributed to decreases in the contact time of nitrate with biofilms increases in do and decreases in doc of pore water addition of biochar improved nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters but the improvement was sensitive to rainfall intensity or hydraulic residence time if the hydraulic retention time was less than 5 h then the addition of biochar helped decrease the exhaustion rate of the biofilter s capacity but at hrt above 5 h biochar did not provide any additional benefit on nitrate removal because woodchips alone were sufficient to remove all nitrate increase in nitrate removal by biochar addition is attributed to change in the water holding capacity of biofilters and pore water chemistry decrease in do and increase in doc retention biochar addition increased microbial biomass in woodchip biofilters but it did not fully explain the increased nitrate removal as the abundance of denitrifying genes was not affected by biochar increase in antecedent drying duration increased nitrate removal in biofilters irrespective of the amount of biochar fraction longer drying duration helped deplete do of pore water and increase the concentration of doc in pore water both conditions favor nitrate removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18516,stormwater biofilters have been increasingly used to mitigate the impact of climate change on the export of contaminants including nitrate to water bodies yet their performance is rarely tested under high intensity rainfall events which are predicted to occur more frequently under climate change scenarios we examined the potential of biochar to improve the resilience of woodchip biofilters under simulated high intensity rainfall events and linked denitrification to biochar mediated changes in hydrological physical chemical and biological properties of woodchip biofilters results showed that nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters decreased with increases in rainfall intensity or duration and decreases in antecedent drying time however adding biochar to woodchips significantly decreased the exhaustion rate of woodchips only when the hydraulic residence time hrt was less than 5 h at longer hrt 5 h the benefits of biochar became less apparent we attributed the improved denitrification during high nitrate loading to biochar s ability to decrease dissolved oxygen in pore water and increase water holding capacity and retention of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate all of which could increase nitrate utilization biochar increased the net microbial biomass but did not affect the relative abundance of denitrifying genes which indicates that a shift in microbial biomass could not fully explain the observed increase in nitrate removal in biochar augmented woodchip biofilters overall the results showed that biochar could increase the resiliency of woodchip biofilters for denitrification in high intensity rainfall events a worst case scenario thereby mitigating the water quality degradation during climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification climate change impact low impact development eutrophication extreme rainfall bioinfiltration systems 1 introduction eutrophication or algal blooms are expected to intensify during climate change partly due to an increasing frequency of high intensity rainfall these climate driven changes increase the conveyance of nutrients to water bodies and warm surface waters which accelerates algal growth whitehead et al 2009 in particular rainfall intensity can be a critical indicator of nutrient pollution because runoff generated during high intensity rainfall disproportionally exports more nutrient per runoff volume to surface waters than runoff generated during low intensity rainfall michalak et al 2013 jenny et al 2016 to treat runoff low impact development infrastructure such as biofilters have been increasingly incorporated into urban and agricultural landscapes yet the performance of these natural treatment systems is rarely tested under high intensity rainfall events norton et al 2017 the resilience of a treatment system can be indicated by the number of events in which the treatment system fails to remove specific pollutants to below a desired standard or by the duration it takes to restore the removal rate after a failure has occurred juan garcía et al 2017 therefore it is critical to evaluate the impact of high intensity rainfall on nitrate removal potential of conventional biofilters and improve their design to increase their resilience passive treatment systems such as stormwater biofilters offer cost effective solutions to treat nitrate in runoff originated from nonpoint sources biofilters are typically designed by replacing a portion of surface soil with soil amendments that serve multiple functions to increase stormwater infiltration to remove pollutants and to support plants growth for nitrate removal carbon amendments such as woodchips sawdust and crop residues are typically used shrestha et al 2018 jia et al 2019 these amendments release dissolved organic carbon doc which the denitrifying microbial communities use as an electron donor to reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas via a series of intermediate steps ambus and zechmeister boltenstern 2007 among these amendments woodchips are popular bruun et al 2016 hoover et al 2016 because they typically last longer and consistently provide doc lopez ponnada et al 2017 for efficient denitrification four conditions should be met 1 dissolved oxygen do concentration should be low preferably below 3 mg l 1 as high do can deactivate the enzymes involved in denitrification gómez et al 2002 2 a sufficient amount of doc must be present newcomer et al 2012 3 the conditions in biofilters should favor growth of denitrifying microorganisms falkentoft et al 2000 4 the hydraulic retention time hrt should be low enough for maximum utilization of nitrate by microorganisms damaraju et al 2015 hoover et al 2016 halaburka et al 2017 thus the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters is sensitive to rainfall characteristics and antecedent weather conditions lynn et al 2015 which may affect all four of the conditions for denitrification rainfall characteristics are expected to change with climate change in particular high intensity rainfall and prolonged dry periods are projected to occur more frequently ipcc 2007 prein et al 2017 which may decrease the denitrification potential of woodchip based biofilters biofilters typically bypass water when the runoff loading rate exceeds the maximum infiltration capacity of the biofilter but woodchip biofilters have high hydraulic conductivity due to large pore sizes thus hrt of the biofilter under high intensity rainfall event could decrease rapidly however most studies with woodchip biofilters damaraju et al 2015 hoover et al 2016 halaburka et al 2017 examined their performance at long hrt 48 h and under steady state condition thereby overestimating denitrifying capacities of woodchip biofilters most stormwater biofilters are passive and subjected to an unsteady condition when nitrate concentration in pore water is expected to change because of either high loading during high intensity rainfall or no loading during antecedent dry conditions while high loading can decrease nitrate removal antecedent drying could increase nitrate removal lynn et al 2015 wang et al 2018 thus the overall performance of woodchip biofilters under unsteady conditions is unclear to increase the resiliency of woodchip biofilters under heavy rainfall conditions biochar a porous black carbon produced by pyrolysis of organic materials can be added to biofilters the effect of biochar on nitrate removal capacity of stormwater biofilters has been reported to vary widely see review by mohanty et al 2018 but the cause of the wide variation is unclear biochar can alter physical chemical and biological processes in the soil but how these changes can affect denitrification is not well understood bock et al 2016 2018 while some studies have demonstrated that biochar addition can improve nitrate removal by increasing storage volume and residence time bock et al 2015 or by shrinking of the denitrifying microbial community chen et al 2015 others have shown contrasting results including the release of nitrate into infiltrating water sarkhot et al 2013 the objective of this study is to link the nitrate removal capacity of biochar augmented woodchip biofilters under unsteady flow conditions to biochar mediated alteration in physical chemical and biological properties of the biofilter we compared the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters with and without biochar amendments under simulated rainfall events with increasing intensities and antecedent drying durations 2 materials and methods 2 1 stormwater stormwater was collected twice a week in 20 l hpde plastic carboys from ballona creek in los angeles ca 34 0 36 n 118 23 29 w which receives dry weather irrigation runoff from a 318 km2 urban area with 82 developed and 61 impervious surface gold et al 2015 stormwater was characterized for ph do and turbidity within 1 h of the sample collection large particulates were removed from stormwater by gravitational settling for 1 h and the supernatant was stored up to 1 2 days in a refrigerator at 4 c to minimize bacterial growth before injection stormwater was warmed to room temperature 23 c and concentrated nitrate stock solution was spiked to 18 l of stormwater to achieve a targeted initial nitrate concentration of 20 2 mg l 1 2 2 biofilter media pine woodchips without chemical treatment whittier fertilizer company ca were sieved sieve 20 to remove woodchips larger than 1 27 cm we used commercially available biochar biochar supreme everson wa which has been demonstrated to remove heavy metals and organic contaminants from stormwater miles et al 2016 the biochar produced by high temperature 900 1000 c gasification of a softwood has following characteristics high bet surface area 690 720 m2 g based on nitrogen adsorption low ash content 4 and low moisture content 10 both woodchips and biochar were dried in an oven at 80 c until the dry weight of the media remained constant oven drying was necessary to kill most of the bacteria from woodchips and biochar this permits us to compare the microbial community developed in columns with and without biochar biochar was mixed with woodchips to prepare woodchip biochar mixtures 5 10 and 20 biochar by volume woodchips without biochar were used as a control media 2 3 biofilter media characterization the particle size distribution of the biochar was determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer model ls 13 320 beckman coulter brea ca usa for woodchips the size distribution was determined using an optoelectronic particle size analyzer model camsizer retsch technology gmbh germany d10 d50 and d90 of woodchips were 3 7 8 4 and 13 3 mm respectively d10 d50 and d90 of biochars were 0 02 0 7 and 1 7 mm respectively fig s1 after experiments saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in all columns using the falling head method the water retention characteristics of the woodchips and woodchips biochar mixtures were determined using a benchtop instrument ums hyprop meter group inc pullman wa the hyprop measures the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity based on the evaporation method by simultaneously recording the sample weight and soil matric potential during the sample drying cycle from saturation to around pf 2 5 pf is the log10 h where h is the suction in cm which is below wilting point we utilized the bimodal soil water retention model durner 1994 which is ideal to describe changes in physical properties of a medium having a heterogeneous pore structure in this case the water retention curve is expressed as a linear superposition of sub curves of a homogeneous pore structure using a unimodal model van genuchten 1980 and effective saturation was estimated using the equation below s e w 1 1 1 1 h n 1 m 1 1 w 1 1 1 2 h n 2 m 2 where s e is effective saturation w 1 is the weighing factor for the first subcurve subject to 0 wi 1 is a scaling factor that determines the position of the pore size maximum h is the suction cm n and m empirical shape parameters and m 1 1 n s e is related to volumetric water content as θ θ r θ s θ r s e where θ is the volumetric water content θ s is saturated and θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 the model was implemented using a nonlinear fitting program seki 2007 and the modeled water retention curve was fitted with experimental data using the derived parameters the details of the method were described in a previous study trifunovic et al 2018 it should be noted that drying of biochar in the oven may have removed moisture from micropores or nanopores which likely reduced the amount of intraparticle pore space that could be wet nevertheless multiple rewetting cycles prior to the experiment is expected to refill some of the pores 2 4 biofilter design to examine the effect of biochar concentration on denitrification potential of woodchip biofilters woodchips without control and with biochar at 5 10 or 20 by volume were packed in plastic columns 5 cm inner diameter 61 cm length and fittings made up off polyvinyl chloride pvc triplicate columns were used for each mixture fig s2 to create a drainage layer gravel was first filled in bottom 5 cm layer a nylon screen 100 μm pore size was placed on the top of the gravel to prevent washout of biochar particulates about 100 g of woodchips or woodchip biochar mixture was added and compacted at 5 cm incremental heights until the total filter media depth was 45 7 cm gravel was added on the top of the filter layer to prevent suspension of biochar particles a submerged layer was created by raising the outlet 30 5 cm above the top surface of the bottom gravel layer all columns were wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent algal growth to displace air from pores in the submerged layer deionized di was injected from the bottom up flow until the filter media layer was completely submerged once the submerged layer was established stormwater was applied on the top of the filter media using a peristaltic pump and the effluent was collected at regular intervals through the raised outlet using 300 ml amber bottles the effective pore volume of each column was estimated based on the volume of water required to achieve 50 of the concentration of influent bromide a conservative tracer method details in supplementary material total pore volume measured by the bromide breakthrough curve does not account for the intraparticle pore volume where bromide transport is diffusion limited thus estimated pore volume only represents the pores or flow paths through which stormwater infiltrated during the experiment 2 5 nitrate removal experiments because both woodchips and biochar were oven dried before the experiment they were expected to have a limited microbial activity to grow biofilms or denitrifying communities the columns were first conditioned by applying stormwater on the top of columns periodically 0 4 d for three months following conditioning of the columns stormwater spiked with nitrate was applied on the top of the columns at a specific rate to simulate different rainfall intensities effluents were collected at regular intervals 0 5 pore volume fraction in 300 ml amber bottles and analyzed for nitrate do ph and uv254 absorbance an indicator of doc concentration in pore water to determine the effect of rainfall duration on nitrate removal stormwater with 24 7 mg l 1 nitrate was injected at 18 5 cm h 1 for 12 h following 4 days of antecedent drying effluents were collected at 1 h intervals and selected samples 1 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 h were analyzed for nitrate and other water quality parameters to examine the effect of rainfall intensity and antecedent drying duration on nitrate removal in biochar augmented woodchip biofilters contaminated stormwater was applied at a specific rate ranging between 19 and 296 mm h 1 to test the changes in nitrate removal during rapid infiltration of stormwater 1 2 l of stormwater containing nitrate was injected through each column at 5 rainfall intensities varying from 19 mm h 1 to 296 mm h 1 which correspond to hrt between 16 6 0 5 to 1 04 0 03 h hrt was calculated by dividing the pore volume of each column type estimated from bromide breakthrough data fig s3 by infiltration rate through pores infiltration rate was assumed to be the discharge rate at the bottom which was observed to be same as rainfall application rate to examine the effect of antecedent drying duration on denitrification stormwater with nitrate was applied at 148 mm h 1 for 4 h on biofilters subjected to first increasing and then decreasing antecedent drying duration in the following order 1 2 4 8 30 8 4 2 and 1 day 2

087010md and uv254 absorbance perkinelmer lambda 365 uv visible spectrophotometer uv absorbance was used as a surrogate measurement for dissolved organic carbon assuming specific uv absorbance of doc leached from woodchips remained constant during the experimental period abusallout and hua 2017 uv absorbance and nitrate concentrations were measured in samples centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min to remove particulates or bacteria following centrifugation the supernatant was acidified ph 3 and stored at 4 c to minimize any microbial activity the samples were analyzed for nitrate concentration using ion chromatography dionex integrion hpic thermoscientific within 1 2 days of sample storage 2 7 modeling exhaustion rate of woodchip biofilters during intermittent rainfall events with high intensity rainfall nitrate loading rate can exceed the nitrate removal rate of woodchip biofilters thus effluent nitrate concentration is expected to rise rapidly due to exhaustion of the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilter to estimate the rate at which the nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters was exhausted with an increase in nitrate loading contaminated water volume during high intensity rainfall we used the following model to describe the concentration of nitrate in pore water d c d v k c 0 c where c and c 0 are effluent and influent nitrate concentrations respectively k is exhaustion rate v is the volume of stormwater passed through the columns the model assumes that change in concentration in woodchip biofilters is a function of the difference in nitrate concentrations between pore water and influent water solving the first order linear differential equation supporting material the effluent concentration can be expressed as c c 0 1 e k v nitrate removal 1 c c 0 was calculated for each column type at all intervals the exhaustion rate was calculated based on the exponential fit of the data showing a decrease in removal with increases in nitrate loading pore volume to compare the total removal of nitrate in a rainfall event as a function of antecedent drying duration we calculated the ratio of the total mass of nitrate removed i c i v i and total mass of nitrate injected c 0 i v i during a rainfall event where i is sample number all samples were collected and analyzed for nitrate concentration to complete the mass balance 2 8 denitrifying functional gene analysis after the experiment columns were dismantled to remove media mixture from the center of the column the total nucleic acids were extracted from the 10 g media mixture using dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen and the concentration of extracts was measured on nanodrop nd 2000 nanodrop technologies willmington de usa target genes encoding nitrate reductases napa and narg and nitrite reductases nirk and nirs were amplified using real time quantitative polymerase chain reactions qpcr conducted on a steponeplus thermocycler life technologies carlsbad ca the primer sets for each denitrifying functional genes and details methodology were described in a previous study miao et al 2018 the qpcr reaction system was 20 μl which included 2 luminaris color

melt curve analysis to confirm the specificity of qpcr products the gene copies numbers in each sample were normalized to the total weight of biochar woodchip samples 10 g with units of copies g 1 2 9 statistical analysis statistical analysis of data anova and tukey hsd was performed using r v3 4 pearson correlation was used to evaluate if an increase in the addition of biochar to woodchip biofilters resulted in changes in nitrate removal capacity exhaustion rate 16s rrna and functional gene abundances differences were considered significant at a p value less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 effect of biochar amendment on hydraulic properties of woodchip biofilters based on bromide tracer study the pore volume of columns with 0 5 10 and 20 biochar by volume were estimated to be 649 1 64 8 623 4 10 8 616 0 34 0 and 607 8 23 2 ml respectively fig s3 thus the addition of biochar did not significantly p 0 05 alter the pore volume of woodchip biofilters saturated hydraulic conductivity of woodchip columns decreased with increases in biochar fraction saturated hydraulic conductivities of woodchip columns with 0 5 10 and 20 biochar by volume were 6048 1080 5364 936 2304 864 and 1476 72 mm h 1 respectively fig s4 although the addition of biochar 20 decreased hydraulic conductivity of woodchip columns by 75 the hydraulic conductivity was still more than five times the observed infiltration rates the infiltration rates were measured based on the discharge rate volume of stormwater collected in each sample divided by sampling time difference between discharge rates from columns with and without biochar was insignificant p 0 5 soil water retention curves of woodchips with and without biochar showed that the addition of biochar increased the water holding capacity of woodchips fig 1 addition of biochar to woodchips increased water retention in macropores and decreased water retention in micropores 3 2 effect of biochar addition on pore water chemistry in woodchip biofilters biochar addition affected effluent water chemistry including ph do and uv254 absorbance fig s5 effluent ph from all columns remained consistent at 7 5 0 1 irrespective of biochar fractions and stormwater application rates or hydraulic residence time hrt in all columns effluent do decreased from 9 2 0 4 mg l 1 influent to 3 3 4 9 mg l 1 as more stormwater passed through the columns however the lowest effluent do value depended on hrt the effluent do decreased with increases in hrt up to 18 h any further increase in hrt did not decrease do any further addition of biochar appears to decrease do in pore water the uv absorbance of effluents an indicator of doc leaching from the system in columns typically decreased with increases in biochar fraction and decreases in hrt drying duration changed the pore water chemistry fig s6 comparing changes in porewater chemistry of the effluent before and after drying we showed that an increase in drying duration decreased do of pore water addition of biochar resulted in greater do removal for 1 2 and 4 d drying but not for 8 d increasing drying duration increased uv254 absorbance of effluents across all columns indicating an increase in doc concentration in the pore water during drying in general woodchip columns without biochar had pore water with the highest uv254 absorbance or doc concentration 3 3 effect of biochar fraction and stormwater loading on nitrate removal nitrate removal decreased with increases in the applied volume of stormwater or nitrate loading fig 2 the model fits the decrease in removal capacity of biofilters comparing the nitrate removal capacity worst case scenario of all columns at the end of the experiment we estimated that biochar amended columns can treat at least 25 more stormwater than biochar free woodchip biofilters before being exhausted to the same level of effluent nitrate concentration 3 4 effect of infiltration velocity on nitrate removal nitrate removal decreased with increasing infiltration velocity which increases with an increase in rainfall intensity fig 3 nitrate was completely removed 100 in all columns at low infiltration rates 19 and 37 mm h 1 with increases in infiltration velocity nitrate removal declined a decrease in nitrate removal with an increase in contaminated stormwater exposure is defined as the rate of exhaustion k of the nitrate removal capacity of biofilters the exhaustion rate decreased with increases in biochar fraction fig 4 a although the positive impact of biochar was significant p 0 05 when the infiltration rate was 146 mm h 1 or higher at low infiltration rate nitrate was completely removed or no exhaustion in all columns irrespective of biochar fractions 3 5 effect of drying duration on nitrate removal increase in antecedent drying duration before stormwater application decreased p 0 05 the rate at which nitrate removal capacity of columns was exhausted during stormwater application fig 4 increase in biochar fraction decreased the exhaustion in nitrate removal capacity increases in antecedent drying duration increased nitrate removal for all columns irrespective of biochar content fig 5 3 6 effect of biochar percentage on bacterial functional gene abundance an increase in biochar fraction in the woodchip column was associated with increased total 16s rna copy numbers coefficient 0 989 p value 0 05 table s2 but did not have any significant p 0 05 effect on the relative abundance of denitrifying genes including napa and narg fig 6 during incubation the total bacterial population had grown which was originally at 107 and 104 copies g 1 on woodchips and biochar respectively among the functional genes napa narg and nirk showed significantly positive correlations with each other table s2 demonstrating their potential critical functions in the columns 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rainfall characteristics and antecedent drying on nitrate removal in biofilters in nature heavy rainfall events deliver more nitrogen than smaller events higashino and stefan 2014 jones et al 2018 intense rainfall events increase not only the runoff volume that create ponding but also the infiltration rate by increasing the moisture content of the filter layer we found that both factors longer duration of an infiltration event with infiltration above a threshold value and high infiltration rate decreased the nitrate removal capacity of woodchips biofilters the removal was high initially 2 pv injection due to the mixing of contaminated stormwater with less contaminated pore water remained in the submerged zone during antecedent dry periods wang et al 2018 this result indicates that the performance of biofilter where hrt of stormwater is low 5 h can be highly variable depending on the volume of stormwater passing through the biofilter during a rainfall volume of stormwater runoff depends on rainfall intensity and characteristics of the catchment area that contributes to the runoff volume thus biofilter size and thickness of the filter layer should be determined during design based on the catchment characteristics and historic and projected precipitation pattern comparing average nitrate removal with increases in hrt we found that nitrate removal decreased with decreases in hrt up to a certain critical value fig s8 however when hrt was longer than 18 h nitrate removal did not change because the removal was at its maximum capacity 100 the lowest removal was observed in woodchip columns at hrt 1 13 h at lower hrt 5 h which applies to most passive stormwater biofilter nitrate removal was higher in biochar augmented woodchip biofilters than woodchips only biofilters we estimated that hrt was a function of infiltration rate not biochar fraction addition of biochar did not change hrt significantly p 0 05 thus a difference in nitrate removal between columns with and without biochar at high infiltration rate excluded hrt as a potential cause of increased nitrate removal in biochar columns this result indicates that a change in hrt by addition of biochar could not explain observed improvements in nitrate removal 4 2 effect of antecedent drying on nitrate removal in biofilters with climate change the frequency of persistent dry condition is expected to increase our results showed that increases in drying duration could be beneficial for nitrate removal in biofilters with a submerged layer as observed in other studies lynn et al 2015 wang et al 2018 we attributed the positive impact of drying duration to changes in favorable pore water chemistry during drying periods do concentration decreased and uv254 nm absorbance of pore water increased during drying increase in uv absorbance of pore water after drying suggests that an increase in drying duration caused more doc to leach into pore water however it should be noted that drying did not affect the moisture content in the submerged layer the layer that potentially removes most nitrate thus doc increased during drying duration because of accumulation of leached doc in pore water over a long period addition of biochar retained doc leached from woodchips during drying conditions and helped remove nitrogen trapped inside the pores 4 3 effect of biochar fraction on nitrate removal addition of biochar to woodchip biofilters improved their nitrate removal capacity and the effect was more apparent when the fraction of biochar added was 10 by volume or greater overall biochar amended woodchip biofilters treated more stormwater than woodchip only biofilters until the effluent concentration reached a similar value because mean pore volumes of biochar amended columns were similar p 0 05 to pore volume of woodchip biofilters pore volume did not explain an increase in nitrate removal in biochar amended columns biochar could occupy the void spaces between woodchips and can decrease the porosity similar to how it was observed in a recent study that used a mixture of coarse sand and biochar trifunovic et al 2018 the positive effect of biochar on denitrification was more apparent at lower hrt 5 h this result confirmed that biochar addition could improve nitrate removal in one of the worst case conditions high loading during high intensity rainfall events thereby contributing to an increase in resilience of woodchip biofilters 4 4 cause of increased resilience of woodchip biofilter following biochar addition our results showed that denitrification capacity of woodchip biofilters decreased under high intensity rainfall events and that the addition of biochar could mitigate this concern an increase in the denitrification capacity of woodchip biofilters by biochar can be attributed to three factors 1 changes in hydraulic properties of a filter layer that increase the contact time of contaminated water 2 changes in pore water chemistry that favor denitrification and 3 increase in microbial biomass that enhances denitrification addition of biochar increased net biomass but did not significantly affect denitrifying genes a lack of correlation between biochar fraction and denitrifying genes suggests that denitrifying genes concentration did not increase despite an increase in the concentration of biomass after biochar addition thus biomass increase should not be used as an indicator of the denitrifying potential of woodchips biofilters biochar affected the hydraulic and pore water chemical properties of woodchip biofilters and consequently affected contaminated water availability and efficiency of the microbial communities to carry out denitrification processes the mean pore volume estimated by bromide tracer did not significantly change due to biochar addition however bromide concentration in the effluent reflected bulk pore water concentration which typically is affected by advection reedy et al 1996 it does not account for the water within the diffusion dominated intraparticle pore space where a temporal change in concentration of bromide or any dissolved solute could be slow due to slow transport of solute by diffusion water retention curves of woodchips with and without biochar showed that the addition of biochar increased water retention in macropore and mesopore regions we attribute this result to the formation of intra particle macro or mesoporosity sun and lu 2014 thus the volume of immobile water could increase due to the addition of biochar which could trap doc leached from woodchips because bacteria concentration is expected to be higher near the surface than the bulk liquid due to biofilm formation increase in the concentration of doc or nitrate in diffusion dominated intraparticle pore space increases utilization of doc and consequently the removal of nitrate biochar also shifted the dominant pore sizes for water retention from micropores to macropores microbial communities typically utilize nutrients trapped in macropores or pores larger than their size thus water retention in larger pores could have contributed to increasing microbial utilization of nitrate in columns with biochar biochar altered the chemical properties of pore water increased retention of doc and decreased do a decrease in do an inhibitor for denitrification can help denitrification similarly retention of doc in biofilters or decreasing the loss of doc into infiltration stormwater could increase their utilization for denitrification a high concentration of doc near the surface of biochar or woodchips could increase the kinetics of denitrification that highly depends on the concentration of dissolved organic carbon hartz et al 2017 biochar could trap doc in pore water or in the thin film near its surface which can be utilized by the microbial community ulrich et al 2017 thus we conclude that biochar mediated alteration of the physical and chemical properties of biofilters creates more beneficial conditions for the denitrifying activity although the microbial community remained unchanged 5 conclusion our results showed that increases in rainfall intensity and duration decrease nitrate removal in the woodchip biofilter but the addition of biochar could improve its nitrate removal capacity by altering water holding capacity of the biofilter and chemical properties of pore water specific conclusions of this study are increases in storm duration or stormwater loading decreased nitrate removal in the woodchip biofilters due to exhaustion of their removal capacity increases in rainfall intensity decreased hydraulic residence time and decreased in nitrate removal at high intensity rainfall the decrease in nitrate removal is attributed to decreases in the contact time of nitrate with biofilms increases in do and decreases in doc of pore water addition of biochar improved nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters but the improvement was sensitive to rainfall intensity or hydraulic residence time if the hydraulic retention time was less than 5 h then the addition of biochar helped decrease the exhaustion rate of the biofilter s capacity but at hrt above 5 h biochar did not provide any additional benefit on nitrate removal because woodchips alone were sufficient to remove all nitrate increase in nitrate removal by biochar addition is attributed to change in the water holding capacity of biofilters and pore water chemistry decrease in do and increase in doc retention biochar addition increased microbial biomass in woodchip biofilters but it did not fully explain the increased nitrate removal as the abundance of denitrifying genes was not affected by biochar increase in antecedent drying duration increased nitrate removal in biofilters irrespective of the amount of biochar fraction longer drying duration helped deplete do of pore water and increase the concentration of doc in pore water both conditions favor nitrate removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18517,drinking water treatment using uv h2o2 advanced oxidation typically results in residual h2o2 that requires quenching to minimize its interference with downstream processes chemical quenching using chlorine or bisulfite are options but there is some uncertainty in the literature about the kinetics of the bisulfite reaction with some reports quoting the reaction as fast and others as slow part of the contradictory information may be due to interference in h2o2 analysis by bisulfite an analytical method was developed to avoid this interference in which monochloramine first selectively quenched bisulfite and then h2o2 was measured spectrometrically using titanium iv oxysulfate for color development the confirmatory experiments suggested that the bisulfite reaction with h2o2 is actually relatively slow with a half life in the order of hours to days depending on the ph and the reagent concentrations as a result within the typical ph range of drinking water treatment e g 6 9 chlorine is preferred over bisulfite as the h2o2 quenching agent on the basis of reaction kinetics however a decrease in ph will lead to an increase in the bisulfite h2o2 reaction rate along with a decrease in the cl2 h2o2 reaction rate such that at ph 5 7 bisulfite is the faster reagent both bisulfite and chlorine were observed to react with h2o2 following a stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 in the natural water matrix tested graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation h2o2 quenching chlorine sodium bisulfite 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops are gaining popularity in water treatment due to their ability to degrade recalcitrant pollutants with ultraviolet light combined with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 being among the most popular methods stefan 2018 one drawback however is that at the uv doses typically applied 90 or more of the h2o2 can survive the uv exposure for a drinking water treatment plant that requires downstream chlorination the residual h2o2 would require quenching since it exerts a chlorine demand several methods have been tested to quench h2o2 keen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 as h2o2 has both oxidative and reductive properties it can be oxidized for example by chlorine davies and kustin 1973 liu et al 2003 makower and bray 1933 or reduced for example by bisulfite sulfite or thiosulfate keen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 activated carbon is another option that has been adopted in full scale practice kruithof et al 2007 li et al 2016 with quenching possibly involving a combination of physical chemical and biological processes huang et al 2018 the kinetics of the reaction between h2o2 and sodium bisulfite sbs has been studied previously and contradictory results have been reported most research has reported this reaction to be fast with effective quenching supposedly happening within a few minutes dotson et al 2010 keen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 on the other hand this reaction has been studied in atmospheric chemistry as a potential sink for so2 schwartz 1984 the reaction was only considered to be significant at low ph such as 5 but became less important at neutral or basic ph due to slow kinetics brasseur et al 1999 according to hoffmann and edwards 1975 it may take hours or days at neutral or basic ph to complete the reaction depending on the initial doses to further understand the reasons behind this discrepancy in reported reaction rates we re evaluated the methods used in those previous tests we noted that the recent studies of the reaction in the water treatment context used the triiodide method to measure the concentration of h2o2 klassen et al 1994 which is not suitable because triiodide cannot be formed in the presence of sbs due to its fast reaction with sbs yiin and margerum 1990 therefore the apparent quick loss of h2o2 in some of the previous research may not have been due to reaction with sbs but rather due to the erroneous lack of the h2o2 indicating compound triiodide due to this potential error the kinetics of quenching h2o2 using sbs should be re evaluated in a water treatment context using accurate methods in contrast the reaction between chlorine and h2o2 has been more widely studied but there are also conflicting reports in the literature about its kinetics the reaction is reported as instantaneous at ph 8 5 in a popular textbook by metcalf eddy and aecom 2013 according to held et al 1978 however the apparent rate constant of the reaction between h2o2 and cl2 is about 3 0 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 5 assuming an initial h2o2 concentration of 10 mg l and an applied cl2 h2o2 molar ratio of 1 1 it will take 22 s to quench the h2o2 to 0 5 mg l and 2 min to 0 1 mg l the reaction is slower when the ph is lower than 8 5 time as short as tens of seconds might be considered instantaneous in some contexts but when dosing chlorine to quench h2o2 this lag in completing the reaction could cause operational problems if for example the residual chlorine analyser downstream of the injection point that is used to control dosing is placed too close to the chemical feed location and or if there is poor mixing of the injected chlorine therefore while the main objective of this study was to determine the reaction rate between h2o2 and sbs a secondary objective was to confirm the previously reported rate constants for the reaction between h2o2 and chlorine 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the water used for these experiments was obtained from the r c harris water treatment plant in toronto and was collected post filtration the plant draws water from lake ontario the ph of the water was 7 6 0 2 as the raw water had been pre chlorinated for zebra mussel control the chlorine demand of the post filtration water was minimal 10 min demand 0 1 mg l but no chlorine residual was present nsf certified chlorine gas 99 5 w w was purchased from praxair acs grade sodium bisulfite 63 7 w w as so2 was purchased from fisher scientific and hydrogen peroxide 30 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich intermediate stock solutions of these chemicals were prepared in milli q water the chlorine stock solution was prepared by diffusing chlorine gas into milli q water from a chlorine gas cylinder the gas flow was controlled by a praxair 3022 series single stage stainless steel regulator and a needle valve and was directed through two empty gas washing flasks to prevent backflow to the cylinder into a third washing flask containing approximately 200 ml milli q water any escaping chlorine gas from the mill q water was trapped in a fourth washing bottle containing 2 m naoh solution the concentration of the chlorine stock ranged from 1000 to 2000 mg l and was calibrated using the hach dpd method before the quenching tests 2 2 a modified titanium iv method to measure h2o2 to avoid interference from sbs on h2o2 measurement a new method was developed fig 1 for samples containing both sbs and h2o2 the sbs was quenched immediately using 0 4 mm monochloramine solution ammonia to chlorine molar ratio of 1 3 1 to minimize free chlorine monochloramine reacts instantly with sbs basu and souza 2011 bedner et al 2004 yiin et al 1987 and preliminary tests confirmed that no chlorine was detected immediately after sbs addition to monochloramine containing solutions in contrast there was almost no reaction between monochloramine and h2o2 rate constant is in the order of 10 2 m 1s 1 mckay et al 2013 therefore monochloramine was used to quench sbs selectively while fixing the h2o2 concentration for later analysis monochloramine was overdosed relative to h2o2 to ensure that all sbs was completely quenched and excess monochloramine did not interfere with the following h2o2 analysis as confirmed by our control tests then the h2o2 concentration was quantified using the titanium iv oxysulfate spectrometric method din 38402h15 muñoz et al 1990 with an agilent 8453 uv vis spectrophotometer the titanium method relies on the formation of the yellow orange complex between ti iv and a peroxy group and is immune to the interference by monochloramine note that it is essential to quench sbs before h2o2 can be measured using this method although sbs itself does not interfere with the titanium iv oxysulfate method i e zero reading for solutions only containing sbs and no h2o2 it still needs to be removed as the titanium peroxy group complex formation needs an acidic ph which is why titanium iv oxysulfate is usually prepared in a diluted sulfuric acid solution at acidic ph sbs will quench h2o2 almost instantly 2 3 quenching tests a 250 ml erlenmeyer glass flask was used as the batch reactor to which 100 ml of the r c harris post filtration water with a range of h2o2 concentrations was added the initial h2o2 concentrations in the quenching tests were 2 5 5 7 5 10 and 15 mg l the quenching agents were then added at a molar ratio of 1 1 under rapid mixing by a magnetic stirrer thermolyne cimarec 2 the h2o2 concentration was monitored using the modified titanium method in the sbs h2o2 reaction and using the original titanium method in the cl2 h2o2 reaction as this method is unaffected by chlorine din 38402h15 the cl2 h2o2 reaction was also tracked in a 5 cm quartz cuvette using direct spectroscopy at 235 nm with an avaspec 2048 fiber optic spectrophotometer as a supplementary measure to evaluate the reaction rate under the assumption that the total absorption decrease at 235 nm is due almost entirely to the loss of h2o2 and chlorine species through their direct reaction 2 4 theoretical prediction both quenching reactions were assumed to be second order the rate constants for the sbs h2o2 and cl2 h2o2 reactions were extracted from the rate constants vs ph graphs in hoffmann and edwards 1975 s and held et al 1978 s studies respectively for the sbs h2o2 reaction the second order rate constants were 0 8 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 1 3 m 1s 1 at ph 7 1 1 8 m 1s 1 at ph 6 9 5 0 m 1s 1 at ph 6 8 and 10 m 1s 1 at ph 6 6 for the cl2 h2o2 reaction the second order rate constants were 1450 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 680 m 1s 1 at ph 6 9 500 m 1s 1 at ph 6 7 350 m 1s 1 at ph 6 6 and 200 m 1s 1 at ph 6 3 in addition to calculate the absorbance of the water sample at 235 nm in the cl2 h2o2 reaction the concentrations of the two chlorine species hocl and ocl were calculated using the pka of chlorine 7 5 at 25 c connick and chia 1959 and the ph of the water the total absorbance of the water sample was a sum of the background absorbance at 235 nm 0 039 cm 1 before h2o2 and cl2 were added and the absorbance arising from hocl ocl and h2o2 which had absorption coefficients of 101 10 and 48 m 1cm 1 at 235 nm respectively collins and bolton 2016 de laat and stefan 2018 feng et al 2007 the theoretical prediction was done using microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 quenching h2o2 using sbs the reaction between h2o2 and sbs was slow fig 2 the rate was a function of ph with a faster reaction at lower ph the ph was not actively adjusted for this test but since sbs is a weak acid and the lake ontario water has a low buffer capacity sbs application led to a ph reduction for the highest initial h2o2 concentration 15 mg l a 1 1 stoichiometric sbs dose of 28 mg l as so2 0 44 mm was applied which lowered the ph from 7 6 to 6 6 see the inset in fig 2 the ph during the reaction monitored up to 10 min was stable when starting with an h2o2 concentration of 15 mg l 50 of the h2o2 was quenched after 10 min this percentage decreased to 20 13 and 8 for initial h2o2 concentrations of 10 7 5 and 5 mg l respectively corresponding to ph values of 6 8 6 9 and 7 1 respectively no change in h2o2 concentration was detectable after 10 min when the initial h2o2 concentration was 2 5 mg l at ph 7 2 the theoretical decay of h2o2 using reaction rates reported by hoffmann and edwards 1975 is also plotted in fig 2 the results match the experimental results quite well suggesting that this previous work was correct and that the more recent results reporting a fast reaction are incorrect using the rate constants reported by hoffmann and edwards 1975 the time required to quench 95 of the h2o2 at an sbs h2o2 molar ratio of 1 1 is in the order of hours or days at ph 7 or higher depending on the initial h2o2 concentration this long reaction time likely makes it impractical to use sbs to quench h2o2 in water treatment mechanistically the reaction between h2o2 and sbs is acid catalyzed and hso3 rather than so3 2 is the principal reactive component toward h2o2 which explains the ph dependency of this quenching reaction brasseur et al 1999 hoffmann and edwards 1975 schwartz 1984 3 2 quenching h2o2 using cl2 the reaction between h2o2 and chlorine has been studied as a singlet oxygen generator and was reported to be fast and ph dependent held et al 1978 according to held et al 1978 the apparent second order rate constant for the cl2 h2o2 reaction increases with ph until ph 10 reaching a maximum of around 3 2 103 m 1s 1 and then decreases with further ph increase experiments were conducted to confirm the reaction rates by adding a range of h2o2 concentrations to the plant water and quenching with 1 1 molar chlorine as the initial h2o2 concentrations increased the required gaseous cl2 doses increased which caused the water ph to decrease from 7 5 to 6 2 as shown in fig 3 a the experimentally observed chorine decay was compared to the decay predicted using the kinetics reported by held et al 1978 the comparison was conducted using the h2o2 decay data fig 3a and the evolution of the uv absorbance at 235 nm fig 3b the predictions and the experimental data match quite well all these data suggest that in the ph range tested 6 2 7 2 the reaction between cl2 and h2o2 takes at least 1 min to achieve 95 completion it is therefore not necessarily instantaneous from a practical perspective in water treatment as has been previously reported however it is much faster than the reaction with sbs the reaction between chlorine and hydrogen peroxide is considered to occur mainly through an activated complex formation between h2o2 and ionized ocl or between hocl and ho2 i e one reactant in the molecular form and the other in the deprotonated form the pka s of hocl ocl and h2o2 ho2 are 7 5 connick and chia 1959 and 11 7 holleman et al 2001 respectively which gives the reaction the observed ph dependence held et al 1978 kajiwara and kearns 1973 the ph dependence implies faster reaction kinetics when hypochlorite instead of gaseous chlorine is used to quench h2o2 as hypochlorite will increase the water ph 3 3 comparison of sbs and cl2 as the h2o2 quenching agent a comparison of the apparent second order rate constants of the quenching reactions reproduced from hoffmann and edwards 1975 and held et al 1978 is shown in fig 4 an estimate of the time needed to achieve 95 h2o2 decay at different ph and initial h2o2 concentrations is given in table 1 using the rate constants in fig 4 in general as the ph increases from 6 to 8 the rate constant of the quenching reaction using cl2 increases from 150 m 1s 1 to 2500 m 1s 1 while that using sbs decreases from 50 m 1s 1 to 0 02 m 1s 1 the implication of these results is that the quenching reaction using sbs is likely to be too slow to be used in practice at close to neutral or basic ph this conclusion contrasts with previous reports that sbs is a feasible option dotson et al 2010 keen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 as explained earlier previous studies used the triiodide method to measure h2o2 which resulted in false negative results i e detected no h2o2 while in reality there was coexistence of sbs and h2o2 yiin and margerum 1990 also noted from fig 4 when the ph is below 5 7 sbs outperforms cl2 kinetically in quenching h2o2 implying its possible application at low ph conditions such as quenching h2o2 after uv h2o2 treatment of reverse osmosis permeate in some water reuse treatment applications where the ph is typically 6 qin et al 2005 in addition on some occasions such as in bench scale studies sbs coupled with acid might be a feasible option to quench h2o2 an overdose of sbs might also depress the ph and accelerate the h2o2 decay but this is unlikely to be applicable at full scale due to the cost and the likely need to subsequently eliminate the excess sbs 3 4 reaction stoichiometry sbs was observed to be very stable in the r c harris water in the absence of h2o2 over 10 min data not shown this is consistent with previous reports that sbs reacts with oxygen slowly with a half life of hours or days depending on the ph and the doses brimblecombe and spedding 1974 ekkad and huber 1996 wilkinson et al 1993 zhang and millero 1991 as such the sbs reaction with h2o2 was observed to essentially follow a 1 1 molar ratio under the conditions tested at higher ph however the sbs h2o2 reaction slows and the sbs o2 reaction may therefore become more important potentially leading higher sbs h2o2 molar ratios 1 to completely quench h2o2 similarly the reaction stoichiometry between chlorine and h2o2 was observed to be 1 1 on a molar basis or 2 1 mg l cl2 for 1 mg l h2o2 which is consistent with the findings of a previous study liu et al 2003 recall however that the water tested in our study had been pre chlorinated likely eliminating almost all background chlorine demand in other waters the required molar ratio of chlorine to h2o2 might be more than 1 1 to account for chlorine demand exerted by other constituents such as natural organic matter 4 conclusions the rate of the h2o2 quenching reaction by sbs was re evaluated using a newly modified titanium iv analytical method which was able to measure the h2o2 concentration without interference from sbs contrary to previous reports the data suggest that sbs added at stoichiometric concentrations 1 1 molar ratio reacts too slowly with h2o2 to be a practical full scale treatment

this method although sbs itself does not interfere with the titanium iv oxysulfate method i e zero reading for solutions only containing sbs and no h2o2 it still needs to be removed as the titanium peroxy group complex formation needs an acidic ph which is why titanium iv oxysulfate is usually prepared in a diluted sulfuric acid solution at acidic ph sbs will quench h2o2 almost instantly 2 3 quenching tests a 250 ml erlenmeyer glass flask was used as the batch reactor to which 100 ml of the r c harris post filtration water with a range of h2o2 concentrations was added the initial h2o2 concentrations in the quenching tests were 2 5 5 7 5 10 and 15 mg l the quenching agents were then added at a molar ratio of 1 1 under rapid mixing by a magnetic stirrer thermolyne cimarec 2 the h2o2 concentration was monitored using the modified titanium method in the sbs h2o2 reaction and using the original titanium method in the cl2 h2o2 reaction as this method is unaffected by chlorine din 38402h15 the cl2 h2o2 reaction was also tracked in a 5 cm quartz cuvette using direct spectroscopy at 235 nm with an avaspec 2048 fiber optic spectrophotometer as a supplementary measure to evaluate the reaction rate under the assumption that the total absorption decrease at 235 nm is due almost entirely to the loss of h2o2 and chlorine species through their direct reaction 2 4 theoretical prediction both quenching reactions were assumed to be second order the rate constants for the sbs h2o2 and cl2 h2o2 reactions were extracted from the rate constants vs ph graphs in hoffmann and edwards 1975 s and held et al 1978 s studies respectively for the sbs h2o2 reaction the second order rate constants were 0 8 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 1 3 m 1s 1 at ph 7 1 1 8 m 1s 1 at ph 6 9 5 0 m 1s 1 at ph 6 8 and 10 m 1s 1 at ph 6 6 for the cl2 h2o2 reaction the second order rate constants were 1450 m 1s 1 at ph 7 2 680 m 1s 1 at ph 6 9 500 m 1s 1 at ph 6 7 350 m 1s 1 at ph 6 6 and 200 m 1s 1 at ph 6 3 in addition to calculate the absorbance of the water sample at 235 nm in the cl2 h2o2 reaction the concentrations of the two chlorine species hocl and ocl were calculated using the pka of chlorine 7 5 at 25 c connick and chia 1959 and the ph of the water the total absorbance of the water sample was a sum of the background absorbance at 235 nm 0 039 cm 1 before h2o2 and cl2 were added and the absorbance arising from hocl ocl and h2o2 which had absorption coefficients of 101 10 and 48 m 1cm 1 at 235 nm respectively collins and bolton 2016 de laat and stefan 2018 feng et al 2007 the theoretical prediction was done using microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 quenching h2o2 using sbs the reaction between h2o2 and sbs was slow fig 2 the rate was a function of ph with a faster reaction at lower ph the ph was not actively adjusted for this test but since sbs is a weak acid and the lake ontario water has a low buffer capacity sbs application led to a ph reduction for the highest initial h2o2 concentration 15 mg l a 1 1 stoichiometric sbs dose of 28 mg l as so2 0 44 mm was applied which lowered the ph from 7 6 to 6 6 see the inset in fig 2 the ph during the reaction monitored up to 10 min was stable when starting with an h2o2 concentration of 15 mg l 50 of the h2o2 was quenched after 10 min this percentage decreased to 20 13 and 8 for initial h2o2 concentrations of 10 7 5 and 5 mg l respectively corresponding to ph values of 6 8 6 9 and 7 1 respectively no change in h2o2 concentration was detectable after 10 min when the initial h2o2 concentration was 2 5 mg l at ph 7 2 the theoretical decay of h2o2 using reaction rates reported by hoffmann and edwards 1975 is also plotted in fig 2 the results match the experimental results quite well suggesting that this previous work was correct and that the more recent results reporting a fast reaction are incorrect using the rate constants reported by hoffmann and edwards 1975 the time required to quench 95 of the h2o2 at an sbs h2o2 molar ratio of 1 1 is in the order of hours or days at ph 7 or higher depending on the initial h2o2 concentration this long reaction time likely makes it impractical to use sbs to quench h2o2 in water treatment mechanistically the reaction between h2o2 and sbs is acid catalyzed and hso3 rather than so3 2 is the principal reactive component toward h2o2 which explains the ph dependency of this quenching reaction brasseur et al 1999 hoffmann and edwards 1975 schwartz 1984 3 2 quenching h2o2 using cl2 the reaction between h2o2 and chlorine has been studied as a singlet oxygen generator and was reported to be fast and ph dependent held et al 1978 according to held et al 1978 the apparent second order rate constant for the cl2 h2o2 reaction increases with ph until ph 10 reaching a maximum of around 3 2 103 m 1s 1 and then decreases with further ph increase experiments were conducted to confirm the reaction rates by adding a range of h2o2 concentrations to the plant water and quenching with 1 1 molar chlorine as the initial h2o2 concentrations increased the required gaseous cl2 doses increased which caused the water ph to decrease from 7 5 to 6 2 as shown in fig 3 a the experimentally observed chorine decay was compared to the decay predicted using the kinetics reported by held et al 1978 the comparison was conducted using the h2o2 decay data fig 3a and the evolution of the uv absorbance at 235 nm fig 3b the predictions and the experimental data match quite well all these data suggest that in the ph range tested 6 2 7 2 the reaction between cl2 and h2o2 takes at least 1 min to achieve 95 completion it is therefore not necessarily instantaneous from a practical perspective in water treatment as has been previously reported however it is much faster than the reaction with sbs the reaction between chlorine and hydrogen peroxide is considered to occur mainly through an activated complex formation between h2o2 and ionized ocl or between hocl and ho2 i e one reactant in the molecular form and the other in the deprotonated form the pka s of hocl ocl and h2o2 ho2 are 7 5 connick and chia 1959 and 11 7 holleman et al 2001 respectively which gives the reaction the observed ph dependence held et al 1978 kajiwara and kearns 1973 the ph dependence implies faster reaction kinetics when hypochlorite instead of gaseous chlorine is used to quench h2o2 as hypochlorite will increase the water ph 3 3 comparison of sbs and cl2 as the h2o2 quenching agent a comparison of the apparent second order rate constants of the quenching reactions reproduced from hoffmann and edwards 1975 and held et al 1978 is shown in fig 4 an estimate of the time needed to achieve 95 h2o2 decay at different ph and initial h2o2 concentrations is given in table 1 using the rate constants in fig 4 in general as the ph increases from 6 to 8 the rate constant of the quenching reaction using cl2 increases from 150 m 1s 1 to 2500 m 1s 1 while that using sbs decreases from 50 m 1s 1 to 0 02 m 1s 1 the implication of these results is that the quenching reaction using sbs is likely to be too slow to be used in practice at close to neutral or basic ph this conclusion contrasts with previous reports that sbs is a feasible option dotson et al 2010 keen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 as explained earlier previous studies used the triiodide method to measure h2o2 which resulted in false negative results i e detected no h2o2 while in reality there was coexistence of sbs and h2o2 yiin and margerum 1990 also noted from fig 4 when the ph is below 5 7 sbs outperforms cl2 kinetically in quenching h2o2 implying its possible application at low ph conditions such as quenching h2o2 after uv h2o2 treatment of reverse osmosis permeate in some water reuse treatment applications where the ph is typically 6 qin et al 2005 in addition on some occasions such as in bench scale studies sbs coupled with acid might be a feasible option to quench h2o2 an overdose of sbs might also depress the ph and accelerate the h2o2 decay but this is unlikely to be applicable at full scale due to the cost and the likely need to subsequently eliminate the excess sbs 3 4 reaction stoichiometry sbs was observed to be very stable in the r c harris water in the absence of h2o2 over 10 min data not shown this is consistent with previous reports that sbs reacts with oxygen slowly with a half life of hours or days depending on the ph and the doses brimblecombe and spedding 1974 ekkad and huber 1996 wilkinson et al 1993 zhang and millero 1991 as such the sbs reaction with h2o2 was observed to essentially follow a 1 1 molar ratio under the conditions tested at higher ph however the sbs h2o2 reaction slows and the sbs o2 reaction may therefore become more important potentially leading higher sbs h2o2 molar ratios 1 to completely quench h2o2 similarly the reaction stoichiometry between chlorine and h2o2 was observed to be 1 1 on a molar basis or 2 1 mg l cl2 for 1 mg l h2o2 which is consistent with the findings of a previous study liu et al 2003 recall however that the water tested in our study had been pre chlorinated likely eliminating almost all background chlorine demand in other waters the required molar ratio of chlorine to h2o2 might be more than 1 1 to account for chlorine demand exerted by other constituents such as natural organic matter 4 conclusions the rate of the h2o2 quenching reaction by sbs was re evaluated using a newly modified titanium iv analytical method which was able to measure the h2o2 concentration without interference from sbs contrary to previous reports the data suggest that sbs added at stoichiometric concentrations 1 1 molar ratio reacts too slowly with h2o2 to be a practical full scale treatment

18518,discoloration events in drinking water distribution systems dwdss are usually considered an aesthetic issue rather than a health concern and the potential toxicity of the iron based particles resuspended from deposits in dwdss has not been a focus more importantly it has not been recognized that the iron based particles may have structural transformation under the complex condition in dwdss which would further increase their adverse effects in the present study iron particle dominated loose deposits which were collected from a real dwdss through pipe flushing were firstly found to possess obvious toxicity to human liver cells to further evaluate the potential harms of the deposits feooh crystals which is one of the most representative components in the deposits of dwdss were grown with different types of coexisting matters which may emerge in dwdss results showed that the feooh had obvious structure transformation with coexisting matters which further influenced their toxicity the samples with sharp surfaces had higher toxicity than those with smooth surfaces interestingly although the feooh particles formed with perfluorooctanoic acid feooh pfoa did not have the sharpest surface or smallest particle size among all the samples they demonstrated the highest toxicity with strong generation of reactive oxygen species experimental and theoretical studies verified that pfoa induced the electron migration around fe in feooh pfoa particles the feooh pfoa not only was able to capture electrons directly from dna but also generated ros from o2 using dna as an electron donor which might greatly enhance the oxidative damage to cells this study would broaden the understanding of the potential harms of deposits in dwdss graphical abstract new finding on the mechanism of potential harm of iron based particles in drinking water distribution systems image 1 keywords loose deposits drinking water distribution system discoloration iron oxides 1 introduction in drinking water distribution systems dwdss iron pipes are the most commonly used pipe material liu et al 2017b and thus iron oxide dominated corrosion scales and loose deposits ubiquitously exist gauthier et al 1999 lytle et al 2004 zacheus et al 2001 which can have a variety of effects on the water quality in dwdss husband et al 2008 the loose deposits have complex origins including residual matter from raw water residual particles and residual metallic elements such as iron and corrosion products from the pipes certain types of organic and inorganic contaminants have commonly been found in corrosion scales and loose deposits that were accumulated through adsorption or coprecipitation gauthier et al 1999 notably once a disturbance occurrs such as a pipe burst event as shown in fig s1 particles can be released or resuspended in the drinking water resulting in the deterioration of the water quality such as increases in the turbidity and discoloration liu et al 2017a particle accumulation could have numerous negative effects on the drinking water quality and is one of the main threats to tap water quality liu et al 2013 discoloration events caused by the resuspension of the particles are important aspects of customer complaints throughout the world and they have attracted great interests from both the scientific and societal communities vreeburg and boxall 2007 however water quality problems resulting from corrosion scales or loose deposits in dwdss are commonly considered as aesthetic issues rather than health concerns sun et al 2017 both the iron corrosion scales and iron dominated loose deposits contain a large proportion of feooh particles peng et al 2010 yang et al 2014 metal oxides such as tio2 cuo and zno are reported to have toxic effects zhang et al 2018 but iron oxide particles including fe3o4 and fe2o3 are usually assumed to be non toxic or low toxic matter karlsson et al 2008 generally particles follow a trend of increasing toxicity with decreasing particle size suresh et al 2013 and the toxicity of nanoparticles has attracted great attention for more than a decade in addition to particle size particle shape is another important factor affecting toxicity suresh et al 2013 compared engineered nanoparticles with different shapes including pentagons triangles hexagons squares rods and spheres they found that particles with sharp edges and corners are chemically and biologically reactive atoms at these positions are weakly bound in comparison to the bulk atoms which can influence their interactions and reactivities with microorganisms in addition small spherical particles are more toxic than rod like particles because they can damage the cell membrane easier feooh nanoparticles usually have urchin like nanostructures zhuang et al 2017 and high chemical reactivity in water which means they are potentially toxic applerot et al 2009 found that zno with smaller nanoparticles can produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species ros resulting in a remarkable promotion of oxidative stress for the feooh nanoparticles their ros generation is usually considered to happen in the presence of h2o2 which is known as the fenton reaction zhuang et al 2017 however it is worthwhile to note that feooh was found to be able to generate ros without h2o2 when bonding with graphene through the fe o c bonds induced by fe π interactions zhuang et al 2019 however the toxicity harms of feooh particles in dwdss have not been recognized iron ion released from iron based pipes is the commonest reason for colored water formation iron ion releases refers to its transmission in soluble or particulate form from corrosion scales or the pipe surface to the bulk water colored water is generated when iron enters the bulk water as ferric particles or as fe2 that oxidizes and then forms ferric particles with feooh as a main form in loose deposits sarin et al 2004 due to the complexity of environmental factors metal oxide nanoparticles formed with different types of coexisting matter may inevitably undergo structural changes compared to the pristine materials metal ions such as mn2 ions in drinking water were found to be able to form fe mn oxides during the formation of feooh bai et al 2016 organics with hydroxyl groups such as alcohols were found to be able to bond with the fe2 to guide the oxidation process of the iron oxides zhuang et al 2017 structural changes of metal oxide nanoparticles may further strengthen the nanoscale toxicological effects zhang et al 2018 for example in the presence of phosphate zno nanoparticles change from uniform spherical particles into larger anomalous porous particles that are more toxic to mammalian cells than the initial nanospheres lv et al 2012 most of the toxicity studies only focused on the pristine nanoparticles which could not fully elucidate the potential harms of nanoparticles under complex environmental exposure conditions thus it is necessary to understand the potential toxicity effects of feooh particles relating to their possible nanostructure changes under dwdss conditions to study the structure transformation and the potential harms of the iron based particles from deposits in dwdss in this work feooh particles were grown under the coexistence of various types of common matters in dwdss including inorganic matters cation ions al3 mn2 mg2 and ca2 anions silicate and phosphate and organic matters bisphenol a perfluorooctanoic acid and humic acid the iron particle dominated loose deposits were also collected from a real dwds all the samples were analyzed in terms of their structure and toxicity the influence of the coexisting matters on the particle structure and the bonding type between iron species and organics were further investigated density functional theory dft and molecular dynamics calculations were used to study the particle toxicity produced through the electron transfer pathway the toxicity mechanism related to free radical generation was proposed based on the results the findings could give new understanding on potential harm of discoloration events 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of feooh particles the feooh particles were prepared through a hydrothermal method the feooh particles were prepared in the presence of different coexisting compounds including inorganic and organic chemicals since the sulfate concentration is one of the most important water quality parameters for a number of models and indices including the larson index and has usually been considered a main cause of red water under many conditions feso4 was used to prepare feooh particles sun et al 2017 in a typical procedure 0 222 g of feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 9 was dissolved in 80 ml of distilled water and stirred for approximately 10 min to obtain a uniform solution then the solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 100 c for 24 h the resulting product was collected by centrifugation washed with ethanol once and then dried at 60 c overnight the influence of various types of coexisting matters on the structure of feooh based nanoparticles was studied using coexisting matters as follows a inorganic matter considering the widely distributed cation ions al3 mn2 mg2 and ca2 in drinking water al2 so4 3 mnso4 mgso4 and cacl2 1 mg l were introduced to generate feooh particles named feooh al feooh mn feooh mg and feooh ca respectively considering the possible leaching of zn2 and cu2 from the metallic pipe materials znso4 and cuso4 5h2o were introduced to generate feooh particles which were named feooh zn and feooh cu respectively as anions containing si such as clay minerals and p especially under eutrophication usually exist in drinking water na2sio3 and na2hpo4 were used to generate feooh particles which were named feooh si and feooh p b organic matter considering the widely used of bisphenol a bpa in plastic product production 1 ml of bpa was added into 79 ml of feso4 solution to generate feooh particles named feooh bpa perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa was selected as a representative emerging persistent organic pollutant in drinking water for the preparation of feooh particles named feooh pfoa for the commonly existing natural organic matter in drinking water humic acid ha obtained from drinking water sample which was measured relying on total organic carbon before filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane adapted to ph 2 went through a xad 8 macroporous resin and eluted by 0 1 mol l naoh which has been found to be able to form complexes with metal ions frenkel et al 2000 korshin et al 1998 was used to generate feooh particles named feooh ha 2 2 collection of iron dominated particles from the dwdss we collected loose deposit particles using a net assembly from real water supply pipes in beijing china consisting of old unlined cast iron pipes and cement lined iron pipes which were named ca and ce respectively all the particles were sieved and freeze dried before the experiments han et al 2018 2 3 characterization the morphologies of all the iron dominated particles from the dwdss and the feooh samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi s4800 and transmission electron microscopy tem fei tecnai g2 f20 to analyze the metal elements the solid deposits were first digested in concentrated hno3 at ph 2 0 the concentration of metals was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 2000 perkinelmer usa the x ray diffraction xrd spectra were obtained on a bragg brentano diffractometer rigaku d max 2200 the elemental compositions of the surfaces of the particles were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi electron spin resonance esr tests were performed on a bruker model a300 10 12 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer with 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo as a spin trapping agent the specific surface area pore volume and pore size distribution were tested with nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 4 k using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry system micromeritics asap 2020 and all the samples were degassed at 373 k for 8 h before the measurements 2 4 toxicity evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the cell cytotoxicity of the iron particles as well as the proliferation or viability of the cells with the iron particles a simple nonradioactive and colorimetric 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt assay was used pieters et al 1989 since dimethyl sulfoxide dmso can dissolve cell membranes the absorbance value at 570 nm was used to reflect the number of living cells the materials used to collect and logarithmically count the lo2 cells were sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation for 30 min the cell suspension concentration was adjusted and then 100 μl of suspension was added to each well of a well plate at a rate of 2 104 cells well a control experiment was performed with no iron particles the healthy human liver cells used in the toxicity test were purchased from the shanghai cell bank of the chinese academy of sciences the cells were cultured at 37 c in an incubator with a 5 co2 atmosphere the culture medium was removed after 24 h 48 h 72 h 120 h and 168 h a 0 5 mg ml mtt solution 200 μl was added to each well after incubation the medium was removed and the formazan crystals were solubilized by a 10 min treatment with 150 μl of isopropanol in the incubator the absorbance of each well was measured on a microplate reader epoch2t biotek at 570 nm the relative cell viability was calculated by conducting 3 duplicate experiments and taking the mean value microscopy images were obtained for samples after 24 h and 48 h by an optical microscope dmi8 leica after treated by calcein am 2 5 theoretical calculation density functional theory dft calculations were performed with the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp a spin polarized generalized gradient approximation perdew burke ernzerhof gga pbe functional an all electron plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 ev and a projector augmented wave paw method were adopted the conjugate gradient algorithm was used for optimization the convergence threshold was set to a total energy of 1 10 4 ev all structures and energies were allowed to relax below 0 01 ev å molecular dynamics md simulations were mainly completed by the forcite module of the material studio software package the pfoa feooh system was constructed and a water solution was added a canonical ensemble nvt and a compass force field were adopted first the smart algorithm was used to minimize the energy of the system then the nvt ensemble was used to simulate the md of the system the nose algorithm was used to control the temperature of the system at 300 k and each simulation step was 1 fs while the system was simulated over 5 ns 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural analysis to study the structure of the feooh particles grown with different types of coexisting matters which may emerge in dwdss sem images of the feooh particles are shown in fig 1 from which it could be seen that most of the feooh particles have urchin like structures with sharp hairy surfaces zarzycki et al 2015 reported that inner sphere fe complex formation requires electron transfer but electron transport from the outer sphere to inner sphere would cost energy and prevent electron injection into some of the crystal faces furthermore they also found that the migration of the subsurface charge occurs parallel to the surface running along the iron chains zarzycki et al 2015 due to the resistivity of the bulk crystal phase migration is more energetically plausible than conduction it is reasonable to deduce that deposits with urchin like structures have kinetically fast growth along the laterally oriented crystal growth pathway and then the small nanorods with a raft like alignment are assembled through oriented base attached nucleation and grown from small spherical primary particles vu et al 2014 moreover it also can be seen from fig 1 that the structure of feooh noticeably changes in the presence of different coexisting compounds under the existence of other metal ions the particles do not have obvious changes from feooh among all the samples feooh p is the only sample that does not have an urchin like structure but has a diamond like structure with the smoothest surface with the coexistence of organics the particles have obvious changes in the urchin like structure which may be because the organics with various functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can combine with iron ions to form complexes then the complexes hydrolyze and aggregate to form nanorods before finally generating nanospheres wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 among all the samples the feooh bpa has the sharpest surfaces with abundant long thin spines the feooh pfoa and feooh ha consist of blunt nanorods comparing to the feooh it has been found that phosphate and natural organic matter nom changed the morphology of zno thus resulting in higher toxicity jiang et al 2012 lv et al 2012 therefore the structural changes in the feooh nanoparticles may also lead to changes in their toxicities to study the structure of the iron particle dominated loose deposits collected from a real dwdss through pipe flushing fig 2 shows the sem images of the iron dominated particles from the dwdss interestingly in all the samples urchin like structures consisting of nanorods or nanoplates can be found in the sem images which is similar to the prepared feooh nanoparticles in fig 1 in the ce sample under low magnification nanoparticles with a hexahedron shape can be observed along with the urchin like structures which is similar to feooh p in fig 1 the structures and contents of crystals in the ca and ce are shown in table 1 and the high proportion of feooh crystals in the deposits in the dwdss is in good accordance with the previous reports peng et al 2010 yang et al 2014 3 2 toxicity evaluation iron nanoparticles were found to be quickly accumulated in the liver and spleen through macrophage phagocytosis and entrapment briley saebo et al 2011 wang et al 2001 liver uptake has been found to be the most effective elimination pathway of iron oxide nanoparticles even when the nanoparticles are tuned for specific targeting of tissues or organs briley saebo et al 2011 the size and stability of the iron oxide nanoparticles are considered to be the most important factors in their biodistribution kinetics arami et al 2015 after drinking water containing feooh particles humans have a high possibility of being exposed to the particles especially in the liver to evaluate the toxicity of the feooh particles with different morphologies and compositions healthy human liver cells were chosen as a target in this study fluorescence microscopy images of the cells before and after treatment with the particle samples are shown in fig 3 a in which the green cells are alive while the red cells are dead in the blank sample without feooh particles there were no dead cells were observed after 24 h and 48 h obvious dead cells were observed in all the samples after treatment with the various materials for the particles from the real dwdss ca and ce substantial red fluorescence appeared after 24 h which indicated that numerous cells died within 24 h moreover the green color after 48 h was weaker than that after 24 h which further indicated the damage to the live cells the results suggest that the discoloration events in the dwdss not only are an aesthetic issue but also could cause potential toxicity effects the relative viability results of different feooh particles obtained by mtt assay are shown in fig 3b for the feooh particles grown without any coexisting compounds the viability was lower than that from the real dwdss on the whole the feooh al feooh mn feooh ca feooh cu feooh si feooh bpa and feooh pfoa nanoparticles have higher toxicity to human liver cells than pure feooh which may be a result of their sharper nanostructure surfaces than those of pure feooh the relatively lower toxicity of feooh p which is the only one sample with a smooth surface among the feooh based samples further suggested the close relationship between the morphology and toxicity xu et al 2016 found that iron corrosion products with thicker and more compact passivating layers are less reactive due to the passivating layer preventing rapid electron and mass transfer interestingly although the feooh pfoa particles did not have a sharper surface or smaller particle size among all the samples they showed the highest toxicity with a viability of 29 6 at 24 h which is much lower than that of the pure feooh 81 6 and also lower than the sharpest feooh bpa 60 2 we deduced that in addition to the morphological and size factors the interaction between feooh and pfoa might also be able to increase the toxicity in general most of the samples with more urchin like structures had higher toxicity than pure feooh the sample with the smoothest surface feooh p had the lowest toxicity while the sample with the sharpest surface feooh bpa had the second highest toxicity however feooh pfoa did not follow this regular and had the highest toxicity while it does not have the sharpest surface this interesting phenomenon further indicated that besides morphology there would be other mechanisms involved in the toxicity of feooh pfoa 3 3 mechanistic study as organics with oxygen containing functional groups such as pfoa contains carboxyl groups may bind with iron ions to guide the growth of feooh to study the toxicity mechanism xps analysis was performed to further reveal the structures of the deposit ce and the feooh pfoa in the full survey xps spectrum shown in fig s2 the binding energies at 711 685 and 198 ev were attributed to fe 2p o 1s and c 1s respectively fig 4 a shows the o 1s xps spectrum of ce the existence of fe o c bond indicates an interaction between the feooh nanoparticles and organic matter in the real dwdss as determined from the spectrum in fig 4b the fe o c bond is stronger in feooh pfoa than in the ce sample due to the presence of nonmetal compounds in the particles from the real dwdss the fe oh bond in the deposits is weaker than the fe o bond while feooh pfoa exhibits an opposite trend which indicates that the feooh nanoparticles easily interact with other inorganic and organic compounds that coexist in the complex chemical environments of real pipes which may lead to the transformation of the fe oh bonds into fe o or fe o c bonds in the fe 2p spectra of the ce and feooh pfoa as shown in fig 4c and d respectively the peaks at 711 1 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 6 ev fe 2p1 2 are characteristic of fe ions yamashita and hayes 2008 the feooh pfoa sample contains a higher fe ii fe iii ratio than the ce sample the transformation between fe ii and fe iii is a key factor in the fenton process in a study using real iron containing deposits as novel catalysts they exhibited good performance in pesticide degradation through a heterogeneous fenton reaction oliveira et al 2012 bmpo trapped esr tests were performed for the ce and feooh pfoa samples as shown in fig 5 a four bmpo oh characteristic peaks appeared for both samples in the presence of h2o2 the deposits generated oh due to a heterogeneous fenton reaction between the fe components and h2o2 which was in accordance with the excellent catalytic performance of the deposits in the literature oliveira et al 2012 interestingly we found that the feooh pfoa nanoparticles could generate oh without the addition of h2o2 during the oxidation of fe ii on the fes surface o2 was found to be transformed into h2o2 as an intermediate before finally generating oh tong et al 2016 thus the oh generation by feooh pfoa may be from o2 through a fenon like mechanism anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 found that fe ii and fe iii were the most efficient transition metals for the activation of h2o2 with a higher fe ii fe iii ratio feooh pfoa obviously produced a much higher content of oh than the ce sample in addition dual reaction centers were found to be formed via metal o c bonds which were responsible for the high efficiency of the heterogeneous fenton process and the strong generation of oh lyu et al 2018 for the feooh based materials fe π interactions through the fe o c bonds could also induce the formation of dual reaction centers resulting in the generation of ros without the presence of h2o2 zhuang et al 2019 here we found that in addition to the cation π interactions the combination of fe and pfoa could also lead to the strong generation of oh the oh generation may be an important reason for the higher toxicity of the feooh pfoa among the feooh based nanoparticles to further study the mechanism of oh generation by the feooh pfoa nanoparticles dft calculations were used a color filled map of the two dimensional valence electron density is shown in fig 5b and the inset shows the optimized geometric structure and charge density difference these results further showed that electron rich regions are formed around the fe atoms in the feooh pfoa nanoparticles while electron poor regions are formed around f the c f bond in pfoa has a high bond energy which could further increase the electron distortion around the fe o c bond thus the electron migration in the feooh pfoa nanoparticles was enhanced by the strong combination of the fe o c bonds and c f bonds to form a fe o c f linkage dissolved oxygen do which has been reported to compete with pollutants for the electrons donated by zerovalent iron may capture the electrons from the electron rich regions of the feooh pfoa nanoparticles to generate ros li et al 2018 therefore the presence of electron distortion in unique feooh based nanoparticles has a higher likelihood of using o2 to generate oh thus pfoa could change the toxicity of feooh with regards to both morphological and chemical interaction effects due to the unique physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials traditional toxicological methods are not always fully applicable to the toxicity detection and safety evaluation of nanomaterials especially when nanomaterial exposure occurs at low doses such as environmental exposure without significant oxidative stress damage several indirect toxic effects such as secondary toxicity and compensatory damage are often neglected chen et al 2017 found that nanomaterials could induce dna methylation changes and lead to abnormal metabolic processes as well as signaling pathways resulting in the alteration of various cellular processes dna methylation induced by nanosilver and graphene oxide can lead to abnormal metabolic processes and signaling pathways especially for membrane related proteins membrane skeleton proteins energy metabolism proteins and ion channel proteins thus to further evaluate the toxicity of the particles with respect to dna changes dft calculations were further used to analyze the interactions between the feooh pfoa particles and dna using cytosine as a representative component the optimized structures of feooh pfoa and cytosine with numbered atoms are shown in fig s3 the parameters of the chemical activity analysis are shown in table 2 4 which were calculated according to equations s 1 to s 4 from table 2 the electronegativity χ of feooh pfoa is much higher than that cytosine indicating that the electrons can easily be transferred from cytosine to feooh pfoa from tables 3 and 4 the fe 26 atom in feooh pfoa has the highest fk while the o 8 atom in cytosine has the lowest fk indicating that electron transmission occurs from fe 26 in feooh pfoa to o 8 in cytosine to further study the formation mechanism of the feooh pfoa md calculations were used to study the interaction between feooh and pfoa fig s4a shows the molecular structure of feooh noticeably pfoa can be adsorbed onto the surface of feooh after 5 ns of the md simulation fig s4b the f in pfoa can act as hydrogen bond acceptors to form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of feooh pfoa mainly binds to feooh oriented along the surface fig 5c the length of the h f hydrogen bonds is between 2 6 and 2 9 å indicating that pfoa strongly bonds with feooh to induce the electron migration therefore the iron based nanostructures in particles have the following large toxicity effects which may be overlooked by traditional toxicity assays i the particles can directly capture electrons from the dna in cells due to the higher electronegativity of the iron based particles and ii the particles can generate oh from o2 and attack the cells which can be further accelerated by using the cells as electron donors due to the formation of the dual reaction centers fig 5d cell damage may cause further metabolic changes or inherent toxicities 4 conclusion iron based particles are widely existed in the deposits of dwdss but their toxicities have not been fully recognized here structure transformation of iron based particles was found to happen and had influence on the toxicity the real deposits from dwdss were demonstrated for the first time to possess toxicity to human liver cells among the feooh particles of various structures which may exist in deposits the particles with sharper surface especially feooh bpa with sharpest ordered urchin like structure had the second highest toxicity while the sample with smoothest surface especially feooh p in hexahedron structure with no stabs had the lowest toxicity more importantly we found the special toxicity of feooh pfoa which did not follow the rule of morphology due to the generation of reactive oxygen species pfoa mainly binds to feooh oriented along the surface and the strong bonds with feooh could enhance the electron migration do may capture the electrons from the electron rich regions of the feooh pfoa nanoparticles to generate ros moreover the particles might also directly capture electrons from the dna in cells due to the higher electronegativity of the iron based particles therefore the presence of electron distortion in unique feooh based nanoparticles has a higher likelihood of using o2 to generate oh this study would give a new vision on the potential adverse effects of discoloration events declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18518,discoloration events in drinking water distribution systems dwdss are usually considered an aesthetic issue rather than a health concern and the potential toxicity of the iron based particles resuspended from deposits in dwdss has not been a focus more importantly it has not been recognized that the iron based particles may have structural transformation under the complex condition in dwdss which would further increase their adverse effects in the present study iron particle dominated loose deposits which were collected from a real dwdss through pipe flushing were firstly found to possess obvious toxicity to human liver cells to further evaluate the potential harms of the deposits feooh crystals which is one of the most representative components in the deposits of dwdss were grown with different types of coexisting matters which may emerge in dwdss results showed that the feooh had obvious structure transformation with coexisting matters which further influenced their toxicity the samples with sharp surfaces had higher toxicity than those with smooth surfaces interestingly although the feooh particles formed with perfluorooctanoic acid feooh pfoa did not have the sharpest surface or smallest particle size among all the samples they demonstrated the highest toxicity with strong generation of reactive oxygen species experimental and theoretical studies verified that pfoa induced the electron migration around fe in feooh pfoa particles the feooh pfoa not only was able to capture electrons directly from dna but also generated ros from o2 using dna as an electron donor which might greatly enhance the oxidative damage to cells this study would broaden the understanding of the potential harms of deposits in dwdss graphical abstract new finding on the mechanism of potential harm of iron based particles in drinking water distribution systems image 1 keywords loose deposits drinking water distribution system discoloration iron oxides 1 introduction in drinking water distribution systems dwdss iron pipes are the most commonly used pipe material liu et al 2017b and thus iron oxide dominated corrosion scales and loose deposits ubiquitously exist gauthier et al 1999 lytle et al 2004 zacheus et al 2001 which can have a variety of effects on the water quality in dwdss husband et al 2008 the loose deposits have complex origins including residual matter from raw water residual particles and residual metallic elements such as iron and corrosion products from the pipes certain types of organic and inorganic contaminants have commonly been found in corrosion scales and loose deposits that were accumulated through adsorption or coprecipitation gauthier et al 1999 notably once a disturbance occurrs such as a pipe burst event as shown in fig s1 particles can be released or resuspended in the drinking water resulting in the deterioration of the water quality such as increases in the turbidity and discoloration liu et al 2017a particle accumulation could have numerous negative effects on the drinking water quality and is one of the main threats to tap water quality liu et al 2013 discoloration events caused by the resuspension of the particles are important aspects of customer complaints throughout the world and they have attracted great interests from both the scientific and societal communities vreeburg and boxall 2007 however water quality problems resulting from corrosion scales or loose deposits in dwdss are commonly considered as aesthetic issues rather than health concerns sun et al 2017 both the iron corrosion scales and iron dominated loose deposits contain a large proportion of feooh particles peng et al 2010 yang et al 2014 metal oxides such as tio2 cuo and zno are reported to have toxic effects zhang et al 2018 but iron oxide particles including fe3o4 and fe2o3 are usually assumed to be non toxic or low toxic matter karlsson et al 2008 generally particles follow a trend of increasing toxicity with decreasing particle size suresh et al 2013 and the toxicity of nanoparticles has attracted great attention for more than a decade in addition to particle size particle shape is another important factor affecting toxicity suresh et al 2013 compared engineered nanoparticles with different shapes including pentagons triangles hexagons squares rods and spheres they found that particles with sharp edges and corners are chemically and biologically reactive atoms at these positions are weakly bound in comparison to the bulk atoms which can influence their interactions and reactivities with microorganisms in addition small spherical particles are more toxic than rod like particles because they can damage the cell membrane easier feooh nanoparticles usually have urchin like nanostructures zhuang et al 2017 and high chemical reactivity in water which means they are potentially toxic applerot et al 2009 found that zno with smaller nanoparticles can produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species ros resulting in a remarkable promotion of oxidative stress for the feooh nanoparticles their ros generation is usually considered to happen in the presence of h2o2 which is known as the fenton reaction zhuang et al 2017 however it is worthwhile to note that feooh was found to be able to generate ros without h2o2 when bonding with graphene through the fe o c bonds induced by fe π interactions zhuang et al 2019 however the toxicity harms of feooh particles in dwdss have not been recognized iron ion released from iron based pipes is the commonest reason for colored water formation iron ion releases refers to its transmission in soluble or particulate form from corrosion scales or the pipe surface to the bulk water colored water is generated when iron enters the bulk water as ferric particles or as fe2 that oxidizes and then forms ferric particles with feooh as a main form in loose deposits sarin et al 2004 due to the complexity of environmental factors metal oxide nanoparticles formed with different types of coexisting matter may inevitably undergo structural changes compared to the pristine materials metal ions such as mn2 ions in drinking water were found to be able to form fe mn oxides during the formation of feooh bai et al 2016 organics with hydroxyl groups such as alcohols were found to be able to bond with the fe2 to guide the oxidation process of the iron oxides zhuang et al 2017 structural changes of metal oxide nanoparticles may further strengthen the nanoscale toxicological effects zhang et al 2018 for example in the presence of phosphate zno nanoparticles change from uniform spherical particles into larger anomalous porous particles that are more toxic to mammalian cells than the initial nanospheres lv et al 2012 most of the toxicity studies only focused on the pristine nanoparticles which could not fully elucidate the potential harms of nanoparticles under complex environmental exposure conditions thus it is necessary to understand the potential toxicity effects of feooh particles relating to their possible nanostructure changes under dwdss conditions to study the structure transformation and the potential harms of the iron based particles from deposits in dwdss in this work feooh particles were grown under the coexistence of various types of common matters in dwdss including inorganic matters cation ions al3 mn2 mg2 and ca2 anions silicate and phosphate and organic matters bisphenol a perfluorooctanoic acid and humic acid the iron particle dominated loose deposits were also collected from a real dwds all the samples were analyzed in terms of their structure and toxicity the influence of the coexisting matters on the particle structure and the bonding type between iron species and organics were further investigated density functional theory dft and molecular dynamics calculations were used to study the particle toxicity produced through the electron transfer pathway the toxicity mechanism related to free radical generation was proposed based on the results the findings could give new understanding on potential harm of discoloration events 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of feooh particles the feooh particles were prepared through a hydrothermal method the feooh particles were prepared in the presence of different coexisting compounds including inorganic and organic chemicals since the sulfate concentration is one of the most important water quality parameters for a number of models and indices including the larson index and has usually been considered a main cause of red water under many conditions feso4 was used to prepare feooh particles sun et al 2017 in a typical procedure 0 222 g of feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 9 was dissolved in 80 ml of distilled water and stirred for approximately 10 min to obtain a uniform solution then the solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 100 c for 24 h the resulting product was collected by centrifugation washed with ethanol once and then dried at 60 c overnight the influence of various types of coexisting matters on the structure of feooh based nanoparticles was studied using coexisting matters as follows a inorganic matter considering the widely distributed cation ions al3 mn2 mg2 and ca2 in drinking water al2 so4 3 mnso4 mgso4 and cacl2 1 mg l were introduced to generate feooh particles named feooh al feooh mn feooh mg and feooh ca respectively considering the possible leaching of zn2 and cu2 from the metallic pipe materials znso4 and cuso4 5h2o were introduced to generate feooh particles which were named feooh zn and feooh cu respectively as anions containing si such as clay minerals and p especially under eutrophication usually exist in drinking water na2sio3 and na2hpo4 were used to generate feooh particles which were named feooh si and feooh p b organic matter considering the widely used of bisphenol a bpa in plastic product production 1 ml of bpa was added into 79 ml of feso4 solution to generate feooh particles named feooh bpa perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa was selected as a representative emerging persistent organic pollutant in drinking water for the preparation of feooh particles named feooh pfoa for the commonly existing natural organic matter in drinking water humic acid ha obtained from drinking water sample which was measured relying on total organic carbon before filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane adapted to ph 2 went through a xad 8 macroporous resin and eluted by 0 1 mol l naoh which has been found to be able to form complexes with metal ions frenkel et al 2000 korshin et al 1998 was used to generate feooh particles named feooh ha 2 2 collection of iron dominated particles from the dwdss we collected loose deposit particles using a net assembly from real water supply pipes in beijing china consisting of old unlined cast iron pipes and cement lined iron pipes which were named ca and ce respectively all the particles were sieved and freeze dried before the experiments han et al 2018 2 3 characterization the morphologies of all the iron dominated particles from the dwdss and the feooh samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi s4800 and transmission electron microscopy tem fei tecnai g2 f20 to analyze the metal elements the solid deposits were first digested in concentrated hno3 at ph 2 0 the concentration of metals was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 2000 perkinelmer usa the x ray diffraction xrd spectra were obtained on a bragg brentano diffractometer rigaku d max 2200 the elemental compositions of the surfaces of the particles were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi electron spin resonance esr tests were performed on a bruker model a300 10 12 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer with 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo as a spin trapping agent the specific surface area pore volume and pore size distribution were tested with nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 4 k using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry system micromeritics asap 2020 and all the samples were degassed at 373 k for 8 h before the measurements 2 4 toxicity evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the cell cytotoxicity of the iron particles as well as the proliferation or viability of the cells with the iron particles a simple nonradioactive and colorimetric 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt assay was used pieters et al 1989 since dimethyl sulfoxide dmso can dissolve cell membranes the absorbance value at 570 nm was used to reflect the number of living cells the materials used to collect and logarithmically count the lo2 cells were sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation for 30 min the cell suspension concentration was adjusted and then 100 μl of suspension was added to each well of a well plate at a rate of 2 104 cells well a control experiment was performed with no iron particles the healthy human liver cells used in the toxicity test were purchased from the shanghai cell bank of the chinese academy of sciences the cells were cultured at 37 c in an incubator with a 5 co2 atmosphere the culture medium was removed after 24 h 48 h 72 h 120 h and 168 h a 0 5 mg ml mtt solution 200 μl was added to each well after incubation the medium was removed and the formazan crystals were solubilized by a 10 min treatment with 150 μl of isopropanol in the incubator the absorbance of each well was measured on a microplate reader epoch2t biotek at 570 nm the relative cell viability was calculated by conducting 3 duplicate experiments and taking the mean value microscopy images were obtained for samples after 24 h and 48 h by an optical microscope dmi8 leica after treated by calcein am 2 5 theoretical calculation density functional theory dft calculations were performed with the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp a spin polarized generalized gradient approximation perdew burke ernzerhof gga pbe functional an all electron plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 ev and a projector augmented wave paw method were adopted the conjugate gradient algorithm was used for optimization the convergence threshold was set to a total energy of 1 10 4 ev all structures and energies were allowed to relax below 0 01 ev å molecular dynamics md simulations were mainly completed by the forcite module of the material studio software package the pfoa feooh system was constructed and a water solution was added a canonical ensemble nvt and a compass force field were adopted first the smart algorithm was used to minimize the energy of the system then the nvt ensemble was used to simulate the md of the system the nose algorithm was used to control the temperature of the system at 300 k and each simulation step was 1 fs while the system was simulated over 5 ns 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural analysis to study the structure of the feooh particles grown with different types of coexisting matters which may emerge in dwdss sem images of the feooh particles are shown in fig 1 from which it could be seen that most of the feooh particles have urchin like structures with sharp hairy surfaces zarzycki et al 2015 reported that inner sphere fe complex formation requires electron transfer but electron transport from the outer sphere to inner sphere would cost energy and prevent electron injection into some of the crystal faces furthermore they also found that the migration of the subsurface charge occurs parallel to the surface running along the iron chains zarzycki et al 2015 due to the resistivity of the bulk crystal phase migration is more energetically plausible than conduction it is reasonable to deduce that deposits with urchin like structures have kinetically fast growth along the laterally oriented crystal growth pathway and then the small nanorods with a raft like alignment are assembled through oriented base attached nucleation and grown from small spherical primary particles vu et al 2014 moreover it also can be seen from fig 1 that the structure of feooh noticeably changes in the presence of different coexisting compounds under the existence of other metal ions the particles do not have obvious changes from feooh among all the samples feooh p is the only sample that does not have an urchin like structure but has a diamond like structure with the smoothest surface with the coexistence of organics the particles have obvious changes in the urchin like structure which may be because the organics with various functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can combine with iron ions to form complexes then the complexes hydrolyze and aggregate to form nanorods before finally generating nanospheres wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 among all the samples the feooh bpa has the sharpest surfaces with abundant long thin spines the feooh pfoa and feooh ha consist of blunt nanorods comparing to the feooh it has been found that phosphate and natural organic matter nom changed the morphology of zno thus resulting in higher toxicity jiang et al 2012 lv et al 2012 therefore the structural changes in the feooh nanoparticles may also lead to changes in their toxicities to study the structure of the iron particle dominated loose deposits collected from a real dwdss through pipe flushing fig 2 shows the sem images of the iron dominated particles from the dwdss interestingly in all the samples urchin like structures consisting of nanorods or nanoplates can be found in the sem images which is similar to the prepared feooh nanoparticles in fig 1 in the ce sample under low magnification nanoparticles with a hexahedron shape can be observed along with the urchin like structures which is similar to feooh p in fig 1 the structures and contents of crystals in the ca and ce are shown in table 1 and the high proportion of feooh crystals in the deposits in the dwdss is in good accordance with the previous reports peng et al 2010 yang et al 2014 3 2 toxicity evaluation iron nanoparticles were found to be quickly accumulated in the liver and spleen through macrophage phagocytosis and entrapment briley saebo et al 2011 wang et al 2001 liver uptake has been found to be the most effective elimination pathway of iron oxide nanoparticles even when the nanoparticles are tuned for specific targeting of tissues or organs briley saebo et al 2011 the size and stability of the iron oxide nanoparticles are considered to be the most important factors in their biodistribution kinetics arami et al 2015 after drinking water containing feooh particles humans have a high possibility of being exposed to the particles especially in the liver to evaluate the toxicity of the feooh particles with different morphologies and compositions healthy human liver cells were chosen as a target in this study fluorescence microscopy images of the cells before and after treatment with the particle samples are shown in fig 3 a in which the green cells are alive while the red cells are dead in the blank sample without feooh particles there were no dead cells were observed after 24 h and 48 h obvious dead cells were observed in all the samples after treatment with the various materials for the particles from the real dwdss ca and ce substantial red fluorescence appeared after 24 h which indicated that numerous cells died within 24 h moreover the green color after 48 h was weaker than that after 24 h which further indicated the damage to the live cells the results suggest that the discoloration events in the dwdss not only are an aesthetic issue but also could cause potential toxicity effects the relative viability results of different feooh particles obtained by mtt assay are shown in fig 3b for the feooh particles grown without any coexisting compounds the viability was lower than that from the real dwdss on the whole the feooh al feooh mn feooh ca feooh cu feooh si feooh bpa and feooh pfoa nanoparticles have higher toxicity to human liver cells than pure feooh which may be a result of their sharper nanostructure surfaces than those of pure feooh the relatively lower toxicity of feooh p which is the only one sample with a smooth surface among the feooh based samples further suggested the close relationship between the morphology and toxicity xu et al 2016 found that iron corrosion products with thicker and more compact passivating layers are less reactive due to the passivating layer preventing rapid electron and mass transfer interestingly although the feooh pfoa particles did not have a sharper surface or smaller particle size among all the samples they showed the highest toxicity with a viability of 29 6 at 24 h which is much lower than that of the pure feooh 81 6 and also lower than the sharpest feooh bpa 60 2 we deduced that in addition to the morphological and size factors the interaction between feooh and pfoa might also be able to increase the toxicity in general most of the samples with more urchin like structures had higher toxicity than pure feooh the sample with the smoothest surface feooh p had the lowest toxicity while the sample with the sharpest surface feooh bpa had the second highest toxicity however feooh pfoa did not follow this regular and had the highest toxicity while it does not have the sharpest surface this interesting phenomenon further indicated that besides morphology there would be other mechanisms involved in the toxicity of feooh pfoa 3 3 mechanistic study as organics with oxygen containing functional groups such as pfoa contains carboxyl groups may bind with iron ions to guide the growth of feooh to study the toxicity mechanism xps analysis was performed to further reveal the structures of the deposit ce and the feooh pfoa in the full survey xps spectrum shown in fig s2 the binding energies at 711 685 and 198 ev were attributed to fe 2p o 1s and c 1s respectively fig 4 a shows the o 1s xps spectrum of ce the existence of fe o c bond indicates an interaction between the feooh nanoparticles and organic matter in the real dwdss as determined from the spectrum in fig 4b the fe o c bond is stronger in feooh pfoa than in the ce sample due to the presence of nonmetal compounds in the particles from the real dwdss the fe oh bond in the deposits is weaker than the fe o bond while feooh pfoa exhibits an opposite trend which indicates that the feooh nanoparticles easily interact with other inorganic and organic compounds that coexist in the complex chemical environments of real pipes which may lead to the transformation of the fe oh bonds into fe o or fe o c bonds in the fe 2p spectra of the ce and feooh pfoa as shown in fig 4c and d respectively the peaks at 711 1 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 6 ev fe 2p1 2 are characteristic of fe ions yamashita and hayes 2008 the feooh pfoa sample contains a higher fe ii fe iii ratio than the ce sample the transformation between fe ii and fe iii is a key factor in the fenton process in a study using real iron containing deposits as novel catalysts they exhibited good performance in pesticide degradation through a heterogeneous fenton reaction oliveira et al 2012 bmpo trapped esr tests were performed for the ce and feooh pfoa samples as shown in fig 5 a four bmpo oh characteristic peaks appeared for both samples in the presence of h2o2 the deposits generated oh due to a heterogeneous fenton reaction between the fe components and h2o2 which was in accordance with the excellent catalytic performance of the deposits in the literature oliveira et al 2012 interestingly we found that the feooh pfoa nanoparticles could generate oh without the addition of h2o2 during the oxidation of fe ii on the fes surface o2 was found to be transformed into h2o2 as an intermediate before finally generating oh tong et al 2016 thus the oh generation by feooh pfoa may be from o2 through a fenon like mechanism anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 found that fe ii and fe iii were the most efficient transition metals for the activation of h2o2 with a higher fe ii fe iii ratio feooh pfoa obviously produced a much higher content of oh than the ce sample in addition dual reaction centers were found to be formed via metal o c bonds which were responsible for the high efficiency of the heterogeneous fenton process and the strong generation of oh lyu et al 2018 for the feooh based materials fe π interactions through the fe o c bonds could also induce the formation of dual reaction centers resulting in the generation of ros without the presence of h2o2 zhuang et al 2019 here we found that in addition to the cation π interactions the combination of fe and pfoa could also lead to the strong generation of oh the oh generation may be an important reason for the higher toxicity of the feooh pfoa among the feooh based nanoparticles to further study the mechanism of oh generation by the feooh pfoa nanoparticles dft calculations were used a color filled map of the two dimensional valence electron density is shown in fig 5b and the inset shows the optimized geometric structure and charge density difference these results further showed that electron rich regions are formed around the fe atoms in the feooh pfoa nanoparticles while electron poor regions are formed around f the c f bond in pfoa has a high bond energy which could further increase the electron distortion around the fe o c bond thus the electron migration in the feooh pfoa nanoparticles was enhanced by the strong combination of the fe o c bonds and c f bonds to form a fe o c f linkage dissolved oxygen do which has been reported to compete with pollutants for the electrons donated by zerovalent iron may capture the electrons from the electron rich regions of the feooh pfoa nanoparticles to generate ros li et al 2018 therefore the presence of electron distortion in unique feooh based nanoparticles has a higher likelihood of using o2 to generate oh thus pfoa could change the toxicity of feooh with regards to both morphological and chemical interaction effects due to the unique physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials traditional toxicological methods are not always fully applicable to the toxicity detection and safety evaluation of nanomaterials especially when nanomaterial exposure occurs at low doses such as environmental exposure without significant oxidative stress damage several indirect toxic effects such as secondary toxicity and compensatory damage are often neglected chen et al 2017 found that nanomaterials could induce dna methylation changes and lead to abnormal metabolic processes as well as signaling pathways resulting in the alteration of various cellular processes dna methylation induced by nanosilver and graphene oxide can lead to abnormal metabolic processes and signaling pathways especially for membrane related proteins membrane skeleton proteins energy metabolism proteins and ion channel proteins thus to further evaluate the toxicity of the particles with respect to dna changes dft calculations were further used to analyze the interactions between the feooh pfoa particles and dna using cytosine as a representative component the optimized structures of feooh pfoa and cytosine with numbered atoms are shown in fig s3 the parameters of the chemical activity analysis are shown in table 2 4 which were calculated according to equations s 1 to s 4 from table 2 the electronegativity χ of feooh pfoa is much higher than that cytosine indicating that the electrons can easily be transferred from cytosine to feooh pfoa from tables 3 and 4 the fe 26 atom in feooh pfoa has the highest fk while the o 8 atom in cytosine has the lowest fk indicating that electron transmission occurs from fe 26 in feooh pfoa to o 8 in cytosine to further study the formation mechanism of the feooh pfoa md calculations were used to study the interaction between feooh and pfoa fig s4a shows the molecular structure of feooh noticeably pfoa can be adsorbed onto the surface of feooh after 5 ns of the md simulation fig s4b the f in pfoa can act as hydrogen bond acceptors to form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of feooh pfoa mainly binds to feooh oriented along the surface fig 5c the length of the h f hydrogen bonds is between 2 6 and 2 9 å indicating that pfoa strongly bonds with feooh to induce the electron migration therefore the iron based nanostructures in particles have the following large toxicity effects which may be overlooked by traditional toxicity assays i the particles can directly capture electrons from the dna in cells due to the higher electronegativity of the iron based particles and ii the particles can generate oh from o2 and attack the cells which can be further accelerated by using the cells as electron donors due to the formation of the dual reaction centers fig 5d cell damage may cause further metabolic changes or inherent toxicities 4 conclusion iron based particles are widely existed in the deposits of dwdss but their toxicities have not been fully recognized here structure transformation of iron based particles was found to happen and had influence on the toxicity the real deposits from dwdss were demonstrated for the first time to possess toxicity to human liver cells among the feooh particles of various structures which may exist in deposits the particles with sharper surface especially feooh bpa with sharpest ordered urchin like structure had the second highest toxicity while the sample with smoothest surface especially feooh p in hexahedron structure with no stabs had the lowest toxicity more importantly we found the special toxicity of feooh pfoa which did not follow the rule of morphology due to the generation of reactive oxygen species pfoa mainly binds to feooh oriented along the surface and the strong bonds with feooh could enhance the electron migration do may capture the electrons from the electron rich regions of the feooh pfoa nanoparticles to generate ros moreover the particles might also directly capture electrons from the dna in cells due to the higher electronegativity of the iron based particles therefore the presence of electron distortion in unique feooh based nanoparticles has a higher likelihood of using o2 to generate oh this study would give a new vision on the potential adverse effects of discoloration events declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

to variations in the flow concentration relationship among rain events uncertainty inherent in stormwater quality data and physically based stormwater models requiring a substantial number of parameters a new method for identifying high risk pollution intervals during different rain events is proposed a dataset of the urban watershed located in shenzhen southern china was used to demonstrate the proposed method a cut pool strategy was initially used to pre process the dataset for maximizing valuable information hidden in existing datasets and to investigate the impact of rainfall on flow concentration relationships gaussian cloud distribution was then introduced to capture the trend dispersing extent and randomness of stormwater quality data at any flow interval interval overlapping ratio ior and load contribution of storm flow high risk pollution intervals was used to assess the performance of the method results show that storm flow high risk chemical oxygen demand cod pollution intervals of the shiyan watershed was 0 5 1 5 mm under light rain 0 13 mm 1 3 mm under moderate rain 13 27 mm and 5 7 mm under heavy rain 27 43 mm the accuracy of the identified high risk pollution intervals ior was 63 66 under light rain 64 67 under moderate rain moreover cod load can be reduced by 44 48 with high risk storm flow under light rain 43 49 under moderate rain 32 under heavy rain this method is very useful for effectively controlling storm flow pollution on an urban catchment scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords storm flow pollution index decision making stormwater pollution control cloud model 1 introduction urban river pollution is an increasing serious problem huang et al 2007 pei et al 2013 mandaric et al 2018 an effective decision making tool of the urban watershed pollution control is urgent however storm flow pollution risk was often neglected in existing watershed management decision making tools kim and chung 2014 dong et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 a quantitative method for identifying the storm flow pollution risk interval is therefore vital to urban river pollution control it should be noted that flow concentration relationships in an urban watershed vary among rain events bertrand krajewski et al 1998 li et al 2007 bach et al 2010 especially affected by the total rainfall across the watershed thorndahl and willems 2008 schroeder et al 2011 yu et al 2013 mailhot et al 2015 qin et al 2016 this is mainly due to variations in main pollution sources transported into an urban river resulting from rainfall during a storm event fig 1 it is the variation that results in issues in identifying high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed classification strategy can efficiently simplify a problem and it has been widely used in for example medicinal environmental and ecological fields besaw et al 2009 heyes and lott 2017 for example quinn et al 2001 improved the effectiveness of riparian zone management using a framework based on the classification of the riparian zone and liu et al 2014 maximized the benefit of animal production and ecological conservation by designing a functional classification index however few investigations have studied flow concentration relationships on the basis of rainfall classification in an urban watershed accordingly it is currently unknown whether classification based on rainfall is suitable to simplify the identification of storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed the common methods of pollution risk assessment are mainly divided into two categories i probabilistic based approach and ii risk index approach the probabilistic approach is often combined with physically based hydrological water quality models to quantify risk related to water park and roesner 2012 qin et al 2013 wang et al 2017 although this coupled method can overcome a shortage of data it has rarely been used in identifying stormwater pollution risk in an urban watershed reasons for the lack of use are mainly due to distributed and physically based stormwater models such as swmm rossman 2009 storm hec 1977 and sustain epa 2009 require a large amount of data from parameters which are difficult to obtain additionally they cannot represent the random uncertain and sequence characteristics of event based stormwater data egodawatta et al 2014 wijesiri et al 2016 in contrast risk index approach is simpler and has no requirements for a large amount of data from parameters zhao and li 2013 hofmeister et al 2016 however this approach still cannot solve randomness or uncertainty inherent in stormwater sequence data accordingly both limitations of existing methods and the characteristics of event based stormwater data bring great challenge for identifying high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed the cloud model can efficiently address the randomness or uncertainty inherent in a one sequence dataset li and du 2008 deng and wang 2017 for example analysis framework for water quality time series data based on the normal cloud model has been suggested to quantify water quality relationships between a river mainstream and its tributaries deng and wang 2017 therefore we believe the cloud model to be a useful tool to identify storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed however challenges as to how to transform storm flow and storm water quality data from an urban watershed into a cloud model sequence still exist currently urban rivers in southern china are experiencing serious water quality problems especially during rainy days the main objective of this study is to develop a storm flow pollution index using the cloud model to identify high risk pollution intervals posed by storm flow in an urban watershed the development of the storm flow pollution index entails the following tasks i the classification based on rainfall was initially introduced to simplify the identification of high risk pollution intervals ii the cut pool strategy was then introduced to pre process the dataset in preparation for making full use of information hidden in the dataset and investigating the impact of rainfall on high risk pollution intervals iii gaussian cloud distribution was then introduced to capture the trend dispersing extent and randomness of stormwater quality data at any flow interval iv finally similarity measure based on gaussian cloud distribution was used to quantify the possibility of stormwater pollutant load in any flow interval greater than the background in this investigation storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed under different rain events light rain moderate rain and heavy rain are suggested results from this analysis provide important information for urban watershed pollution control decision making 2 methods 2 1 study area and data the shiyan river watershed a representative urban catchment in southern china fig 2 belongs to the source tributary of the rain fed river the watershed has a warm humid subtropical climate with an average annual rainfall of 1933 mm event based rainfall depth in the watershed can vary from 0 to 417 2 mm the shiyan river watershed has experienced rapid urbanization having an area of 25 km2 of which 32 is classified as having an impervious surface residential industrial agricultural and sparse forest land use comprise 10 16 29 and 37 of the area respectively although both combined and separate sewer systems are utilized in the shiyan river watershed a misconnection exists between the two systems due to reconstruction of the sewer system therefore variations in the flow concentration relationship among different rain events in the watershed are exacerbated consequently making it difficult to identify the high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in the urban watershed the dataset used to test the proposed method are twenty six event based storm flow and water quality data from the shiyan river watershed which was collected by qin et al 2016 a summary of the dataset used is i one minute rainfall observation records from the shenzhen meteorology bureau ii streamflow measurements with a temporal resolution of 10 min and iii chemical oxygen demand cod observations with a temporal resolution of 20 min more details about these data are available in qin et al 2016 in addition we collected hourly rainfall time series records from the shenzhen meteorology bureau spanning the last ten years for six sites 2 2 method development 2 2 1 method framework international organization for standardization iso defined risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives iso 2009a b in other words risk is the combination of the likelihood or probability of a hazard resulting in an adverse event and the severity of the event this definition has been widely applied to both flood risk assessments apel et al 2004 wang et al 2015 and landslide risk assessments lu et al 2014 azimi et al 2018 amongst others according to this definition pollution risk related to storm flow can be defined as a combination of the storm flow pollutant flux driven by rain and the possibility of its occurrence in order to quantify the pollution risk of a storm flow the following storm flow pollution index was developed 1 s p i k r p f k 0 p k 0 where s p i k is the storm flow pollution index at the kth flow interval r p f k 0 is the storm flow pollution severity at the kth flow interval and p k 0 is occurrence possibility of r p f k 0 the development flowchart of the storm flow pollution index fig 3 is summarized as step 1 classify the dataset i e the storm flow and quality data according to its rainfall data section 2 2 2 step 2 pre process the dataset and transform it into the cloud model sequence for bridging the raw data and the calculation of storm flow pollution index section 2 2 3 step 3 construct the storm flow pollution index calculate the storm flow pollution severity and its occurrence possibility section 2 2 4 step 4 calculate the index value at any flow interval and identify the high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed 2 2 2 classification of the dataset based on rainfall data classification is an important strategy for simplifying a problem in order to simplify the identification of storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed classification of the dataset the flow and pollutant concentration data based on rainfall data was adopted the common six hour minimum inter event time mit criterion was adopted for defining the independent rain event uson and ramos 2001 dunkerley 2010 the widely used percentile method frich et al 2002 rahmani et al 2016 was used to determine the rainfall threshold value of different rain events finally 10 year hourly rainfall resolution records from six different sites in shenzhen were used to determine rainfall threshold value of different rain events results gained from this method are shown in table 1 2 2 3 transformation of the dataset into the cloud model sequence 2 2 3 1 cut pool strategy cut pool is a data pre processing strategy used to maximize valuable information in an existing dataset and to obtain an overview of the impact of one factor on the target variable especially when significant variation exists in their relationship bach et al 2010 alias et al 2014 for example for function y f x x it varies among events an increment of x was initially chosen and cut into pieces we then observed y from the same x interval among different events that can be pooled together red box thus making it possible to use the majority of data information to investigate the impact of x on y fig 4 in order to obtain an overview of the impact of rainfall on storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed the cut pool strategy was used to pre process the dataset 2 2 3 2 cloud model transformation the cloud model is a novel and promising method for risk assessment which can efficiently address vagueness and uncertainty inherent in a dataset yang et al 2018 more information about cloud model can refer to supplementary material in order to quantify storm flow pollution risk using the cloud model a multiple step backward cloud transformation mbct algorithm xu et al 2014 was used to transform the dataset into the cloud model sequence the flowchart used to transform the dataset into the cloud model sequence is shown in fig 5 and summarized below step 1 determine an increment of the flow i e slice size and cut each event from one classified dataset i e the pollutant concentration values into a slice according to the flow increment step 2 pool together these pollutant concentration values from the same slice i e the same flow interval to obtain the sample collection composed of these pollutant concentration values from the same flow interval i 1 i m s l i c e i j s l i c e j step 3 transform each sample collection from different flow intervals into a normal cloud model represented by three numerical parameters s l i c e j c x j e x j e n x j h e x j using a mbct algorithm finally the dataset the pollutant concentration values under one classified rain event was transformed into a one dimensional normal cloud model sequence thus the physical interpretations of parameters in the development of the storm flow pollution index can be developed based on the original descriptions of parameters table 2 2 2 4 calculation of the storm flow pollution index based on cloud model theory 2 2 4 1 calculation of storm flow pollution severity the storm flow pollution severity at the kth cumulative volume of storm flow can be represented by the ratio of the pollutant flux at the kth cumulative volume of storm flow to that of equal volume base flow rpf k 0 it can be calculated as 2 r p f k 0 p o l l u t a n t f l u x k p o l l u t a n t f l u x 0 3 p o l l u t a n t f l u x k e x k v f l o w i n t e r v a l 4 p o l l u t a n t f

pollutant flux of v f l o w i n t e r v a l flow when no storm occurs v f l o w i n t e r v a l is the volume of flow at each flow interval e x k is mean pollution concentration at the kth flow interval and e x 0 is mean pollution concentration of the receiving water body when no storm occurs thus eqs 2 4 can be simplified as 5 r p f k 0 e x k e x 0 2 2 4 2 calculation of the occurrence possibility of the storm flow pollution severity variable pollutant concentration cumulative volume relationships among rain events results in changeable pollutant flux of the kth flow interval among rain events thus making the storm flow pollution severity uncertain similarity between two one dimensional normal clouds proposed by deng et al 2016 can be used to quantify the similarity of two uncertain datasets in order to quantify the uncertainty of storm flow pollution severity this method was used to calculate the occurrence possibility of r p f k 0 for example using given two cloud models c x 0 e x 0 e n 0 h e 0 and c k e x k e n k h e k representing possible background pollutant concentration values and possible pollutant concentration values at the kth flow interval respectively their expectation curves can be expressed as 6 u 0 exp x e x 0 2 2 e n 0 2 7 u k exp x e x k 2 2 e n k 2 where x is any pollutant concentration value at one flow interval ex is mean pollution concentration en is the measurement of uncertainty of ex u is the gaussian membership degree namely the measurement of any pollutant concentration value belonging to this flow interval and the subscripts k and 0 represent the kth flow interval and the background pollutant concentration without a storm event respectively a summary of the schematic diagram calculating the occurrence possibility of r p f k 0 fig 6 shaded zone is summarized as step 1 calculate the overlap degree o d x k 0 of the expectation curves u 0 and u k 8 o d x k 0 2 min s u p c x 0 s u p c x k max i n f c x

belonging to cloud model c x 0 and c x k respectively satisfying the 3en rule note that o d x k 0 0 1 in this equation o d x k 0 equals zero when no overlapping area satisfies the 3en rule between c x

are common point forecast problems many indicators such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and the root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 can be used to evaluate the performance of this kind of model in this study however our focus was on its interval identification rather point forecast currently few indicators are suitable to assess the performance of interval identification finally two approaches were available to assess the performance of the proposed method including the interval overlapping ratio ior and load contribution of high risk pollution intervals for this purpose all datasets of light moderate rain events were randomly split into a training dataset 60 and a testing dataset 40 according to the mixed bag approach razavi and tolson 2013 arsenault et al 2018 this process was repeated ten times interval overlapping ratio ior is the agreement of intervals between identified response and measured response deng and guo 2018 for two length equal continuous intervals s s s and m m m representing the estimated and measured intervals respectively there exist five positional relationships denoted as case1 case 5 between them as seen in fig 7 ior can be calculated as follows 13 i o r 0 c a s e 1 c a s e 5 l e n s m l e n m c a s e 2 c a s e 4 1 c a s e 3 where l e n s and l e n m are the length of the continuous intervals s and m respectively they can be calculated as follows 14 l e n s s s 15 l e n m m m where s and s are the upper and lower boundary of interval s respectively m and m are the upper and lower boundary of interval m respectively based on the definition of high risk pollution intervals of storm flow load contribution of high risk pollution intervals of storm flow can be therefore calculated as 16 lc v 20 r i s k l v 20 r i s k l e where lc v 20 r i s k is the load contribution of high risk pollution intervals l v 20 r i s k is the load of high risk pollution intervals and l e is the load of the storm event the index performance is determined either by ior or l v 20 r i s k table 3 the index performance is considered to be good when ior is within 60 100 moderate when 30 60 and bad when 0 30 taking account load contribution of high risk pollution interval lc v 20 risk the index performance is considered to be good when lc v 20 risk is within 40 100 moderate when 25 40 and bad when 0 25 2 4 assessment of robustness the slice size an important parameter in the process of the development of the storm flow pollution index will affect the number of stormwater samples in each flow interval thus affecting the distribution of stormwater pollutant concentration in a flow interval and the accuracy of the model for example a smaller slice size may result in too fewer samples to capture the distribution of pollutant concentration thus failing to identify the high risk pollution interval otherwise higher resolution data is needed which will increase the cost of the experimental analysis in contrast a larger slice size may weaken the difference in the distribution of stormwater pollutant concentration between the two adjacent flow intervals thus leading to a coarse and inaccurate prediction interval determination of slice size should meet two requirements i to guarantee that the number of samples in any flow interval will be greater than 5 10 and ii that the slice size should be less than half of the cumulative volume of a storm flow therefore six different slice sizes 0 6 0 8 1 1 3 1 8 and 2 1 mm were chosen to investigate their impact on high risk pollution intervals the slice size 1 mm was chosen to demonstrated the identification process in this paper 3 results 3 1 a cloud model based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume results for a cloud model based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume under moderate rain fig 8 indicate a trend for flow cod concentration relationship from rain events with the same range rainfall the results also indicate uncertainty of the cod concentration at each flow interval using the mbct algorithm all possible cod concentration values at each flow interval were transformed into a one dimensional normal model represented by three numerical features c x k e x k e n x k h e k results from this analysis were then displayed fig 8 using a forward cloud transformation fct algorithm wang et al 2014 the y axis of each point represented a possible cod concentration value and its x axis represented the relative likelihood of this cod concentration value at this flow interval for example point a 0 8 represented the likelihood of the cod concentration value equaling 500 at the 2 3 mm cumulative volume interval note that the y axis of the red point equal to e x k was the most representative cod concentration value at each flow interval i e the characteristic cod concentration at each flow denoted as cod for convenience whose relative likelihood was highest equaling one entropy en reflected the fluctuation range of cod concentration that is the uncertainty measurement of cod at this flow interval thus the trend of the red points reflected the trend of the flow cod concentration relationship under uncertainty results in fig 8 indicate that cod concentration initially rapidly increased before slowly decreasing with an increase of cumulative volume additionally results for the pearson test indicated that a good correlation existed between expectation ex and entropy en heavy rain did not record a good correlation table 4 this result indicates that uncertainty of the cod concentration was related to cod concentration the exception under heavy rain was mainly due to the bias estimate of these parameters resulting from only two heavy rain events 3 2 storm flow pollution index for identifying high risk pollution intervals the storm flow pollution index developed using the cloud model reflects the relative pollution risk of storm flow at any flow interval compared with situations without a storm event a larger storm flow pollution index value indicates a higher pollution risk and a value greater than one indicates that a pollution risk exists results for the relationship between the storm flow pollution index and the cumulative volume fig 9 a recorded a gradual decrease from 1 51 to 0 09 for the storm flow pollution index when cumulative volume increased from 1 to 5 mm under light rain 0 13 mm in contrast the storm flow pollution index initially increased from 1 39 to 4 69 when cumulative volume increased from 1 to 2 mm under moderate rain 13 1 27 mm before decreasing to 0 39 when cumulative volume increased from 2 to 9 mm however under heavy rain 27 1 45 mm the index results initially increased from 0 74 to 4 42 when cumulative volume increased from 1 to 6 mm before rapidly decreasing to 0 01 when cumulative volume increased from 8 to 10 mm the high risk cod pollution interval of a storm flow can be identified by comparing the storm flow pollution index of each flow interval in the shiyan river storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals were 0 5 1 5 mm under light rain 1 3 mm under moderate rain and 5 7 mm under heavy rain the corresponding storm flow pollution indices were 1 38 1 51 2 85 4 69 and 4 35 4 36 respectively this result indicates that storm flow pollution risk was greatest under moderate rain followed by heavy rain and light rain this is mainly because pollutant flux largely depends on wash off and transportation capacity of storm flow and its dilution effect as rainfall increased from light rain to heavy rain more runoff is generally generated and more pollutants will be washed off and transported into the river the dilution effect will also increase at the same time however wash off and transportation capacity of storm flow dominates in moderate rain events while its dilution effect dominates in heavy rain events moreover the storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals tended to shift backwards as rainfall increased from light rain to moderate rain to heavy rain 3 3 performance assessment of the proposed index in this section interval overlapping ratio ior and load contribution of high risk pollution intervals l c v 20 r i s k were used to assess the performance of the presented method fig 10 ior was used to assess the agreement between the identified high risk cod pollution intervals and the measured as described in table 5 ior under light rain was 66 and 63 for training and testing respectively in moderate rain results were 64 and 67 respectively a lower ior value 55 for training recorded under heavy rain was mainly due to only two heavy rain events occurring in the studied time period this result indicates that the proposed method has a good performance of identifying high risk cod pollution intervals the good performance owed to that both the ratio of the cod flux and the possibility of its occurrence were taken into account using the cloud model fig 9b and c l c v 20 r i s k was used to assess the load contribution of storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals as seen in table 5 the load contribution of high risk pollution intervals under light rain was 49 and 43 for training and testing respectively in moderate rain results were 48 and 44 respectively as expected we found that 20 volume storm flow can on average control 40 50 cod load when focusing on high risk pollution intervals of storm flow 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of the proposed method 4 1 1 representation for the event based flow concentration relationships cod concentration for each cumulative volume interval fig 11 show that the relationship between mean or median cod concentration and cumulative volume initially rapidly increased before decreasing slowly with an increase in cumulative volume this result was in agreement with the cloud model based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume fig 8 cod concentration with cumulative volume also recorded significant fluctuations indicating that there was uncertainty inherent in cod concentration of each flow interval this being in agreement with the entropy results fig 8 in addition it can be seen that each value point was a different shade of color indicating that the distribution of cod concentration was not uniform at each flow interval this difference shows that the cloud model based flow concentration relationship had a good representation for the event based flow concentration relationship for rain events with the same range rainfall event based relationships between cod concentration and cumulative volume at the outlet of the shiyan river from different rain events but with the same rainfall range fig 12 were generally consistent except for a few exceptions such as the small rain events on the 2011 09 02 or 2011 09 08 fig 12a results in fig 12 indicate that the rainfall based classification idea was generally reasonable a few exceptions can be explained by the difference in the characteristics of different rain events such as rainfall intensity and antecedent dry periods liu et al 2013 salim et al 2019 however this relationship varied from one rain event to another even under rain events with same range rainfall this also shows the necessity of investigating the flow concentration relationship based on rainfall data accordingly the cloud model based flow concentration relationship had a good representation for the event based flow concentration relationship under rain events with the same range rainfall on the one hand it visualized the trend of flow concentration from rain events with the same range rainfall on the other hand it visualized the uncertain nature of pollution concentration at each flow interval 4 1 2 impact of rainfall depth on the flow concentration relationship rainfall has a significant influence on the flow concentration relationship especially at the watershed scale this is mainly because the pollutant concentration depends on the wash off effect and the dilution effect of the storm flow however variations in the flow concentration relationship among storm events and its uncertainty made it difficult to investigate the impact of rainfall on the flow concentration relationship using the proposed method we investigated the impact of rainfall on the flow cod concentration relationship fig 12a at the same time the impact of rainfall on the relationship between the cumulative cod flux and the cumulative volume was also investigated fig 12b it is worth noting that with rainfall increasing from light rain to moderate rain to heavy rain the peak cod concentration gradually shifted back and there would be more volume high concentration storm flow fig 12a this largely accounted for the difference in the high risk pollution intervals among different events suggesting we should identify high risk pollution intervals based on rainfall data to undertake pollution control strategies in addition an s curve relationship between cumulative cod flux and cumulative volume was evident similar to that recorded for the growth curve however this s curve relationship was distorted under light or moderate rain similar to the early stages under heavy rain fig 12b this result indicates that pollutants transported into the river under light or moderate rain was only a fraction of that transported under heavy rain this finding mainly occurs as the migration energy of storm flow is relatively small under light rain and only a small amount of easily washed off pollutants mainly from the effective impervious surface attached to small particle street dust are transported into the river as rainfall increases from light to heavy rain storm flow energy gradually increases resulting in pollutants which are harder to wash off from non effective impervious surfaces pipeline sediments and riverbeds gradually being transported into the river fig 1 however the phenomenon that the last part of the cumulative cod flux cumulative volume curve increased very slowly under heavy rain indicated that available washed off pollutants would reduce when cumulative volume increased to a certain extent and that the dilution effect of storm flow would gradually become dominant overall compared with the event based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume fig 10 our method can more clearly reflect the impact of rainfall on the flow cod concentration relationship as well as on the cumulative volume cumulative cod flux relationship it also largely explains differences in the high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed among different rainfall event types thorndahl and willems 2008 schroeder et al 2011 yu et al 2013 mailhot et al 2015 qin et al 2016 4 2 the robustness of the proposed method six different slice sizes 0 6 0 8 1 1 3 1 8 and 2 1 mm were chosen to investigate the impact of slice size on high risk pollution intervals results in fig 13 show that the cumulative volume vs storm flow pollution index relationship curve became smoother as the slice size increased this indicated that predicted pollution risk would be lower when a larger slice size was selected such as a slice size of 2 1 however noise occurred when a smaller slice size was selected such as a slice size of 0 6 this difference can be explained by the dilution effect of water when choosing a large size slice however slice size had little impact on the accuracy of the identified high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in the urban watershed for instance the storm flow pollution index peak was within fixed flow intervals regardless of the slice size and the rain event accordingly the proposed method for predicting the high risk pollution intervals is not sensitive to slice size 4 3 further considerations although the proposed method had a good performance for the shiyan river watershed more studies are required in other watersheds to verify the applicability of this method in addition we should not ignore the following facts 1 significant differences in the relationship between different pollutants and cumulative volume in urban watersheds exist xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 2 apart from rainfall depth other characteristics such as rain intensity rainfall duration can affect the wash off process of pollutants liu et al 2013 gong et al 2016 and 3 watershed characteristics such as land use and population density can also affect the accumulation and wash off of pollutants rodriguez hernandez et al 2013 li et al 2015 these factors affect the storm flow concentration relationship in an urban watershed thus affecting storm flow high risk pollution intervals therefore further research is needed to improve this method for example we can attempt to explore the high risk pollution intervals of other pollutants in storm flow from an urban watershed such as total suspended solids ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus etc additionally we can investigate storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed based on different classification standards of rain event such as only considering rainfall intensity or rainfall depth or one comprehensively considering rain intensity rainfall depth and rainfall duration furthermore it is possible to investigate the effect of watershed characteristics finally as pollutant concentration tends to be lower in a large watershed due to dilution effects and the volume of polluted water can be too large to be accommodated and treated the proposed method is applicable to a small urban watershed 2 30 km2 5 conclusions a storm flow pollution index model identifying storm flow high risk pollution intervals of an urban watershed was developed using a cloud model method a high temporal resolution dataset of an urban watershed located in shenzhen southern china was used to develop and demonstrated the proposed method our results show that the cloud model based flow cod concentration relationship can visualize not only the trend of the flow cod concentration relationship from rain events with the same range rainfall it can also identify the uncertainty of the cod concentration at each flow interval results indicate that storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals of the shiyan watershed was 0 5 1 5 mm under light rain 1 3 mm under moderate rain and 5 7 mm under heavy rain the accuracy of the identified high risk pollution intervals ior was 63 66 under light rain 64 67 under moderate rain these results implied that the proposed model had a good performance for identifying the storm flow high risk pollution intervals of an urban watershed based on rainfall data results also show chemical oxygen demand cod load can be reduced by 44 48 with high risk storm flow under light rain 43 49 under moderate rain 32 under heavy rain this suggests that controlling high risk storm flow can achieve greater load reduction results further show that the proposed method made it possible to investigate the impact of rainfall on the flow concentration relationship with rainfall being shown to be a main reason for differences in high risk pollution intervals among different events this finding suggests that pollution control strategies can be formulated based on storm flow high risk pollution intervals of an urban watershed accordingly this method is very useful for urban watershed pollution control decision making

18519,identifying high risk storm flow pollution intervals in an urban watershed is critical for watershed pollution control decision making high risk pollution intervals of storm flow are defined as storm flow intervals that contribute more than the background pollutant load and whose load contribution rank in the top 20 however the identification of high risk pollution intervals is difficult due to variations in the flow concentration relationship among rain events uncertainty inherent in stormwater quality data and physically based stormwater models requiring a substantial number of parameters a new method for identifying high risk pollution intervals during different rain events is proposed a dataset of the urban watershed located in shenzhen southern china was used to demonstrate the proposed method a cut pool strategy was initially used to pre process the dataset for maximizing valuable information hidden in existing datasets and to investigate the impact of rainfall on flow concentration relationships gaussian cloud distribution was then introduced to capture the trend dispersing extent and randomness of stormwater quality data at any flow interval interval overlapping ratio ior and load contribution of storm flow high risk pollution intervals was used to assess the performance of the method results show that storm flow high risk chemical oxygen demand cod pollution intervals of the shiyan watershed was 0 5 1 5 mm under light rain 0 13 mm 1 3 mm under moderate rain 13 27 mm and 5 7 mm under heavy rain 27 43 mm the accuracy of the identified high risk pollution intervals ior was 63 66 under light rain 64 67 under moderate rain moreover cod load can be reduced by 44 48 with high risk storm flow under light rain 43 49 under moderate rain 32 under heavy rain this method is very useful for effectively controlling storm flow pollution on an urban catchment scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords storm flow pollution index decision making stormwater pollution control cloud model 1 introduction urban river pollution is an increasing serious problem huang et al 2007 pei et al 2013 mandaric et al 2018 an effective decision making tool of the urban watershed pollution control is urgent however storm flow pollution risk was often neglected in existing watershed management decision making tools kim and chung 2014 dong et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 a quantitative method for identifying the storm flow pollution risk interval is therefore vital to urban river pollution control it should be noted that flow concentration relationships in an urban watershed vary among rain events bertrand krajewski et al 1998 li et al 2007 bach et al 2010 especially affected by the total rainfall across the watershed thorndahl and willems 2008 schroeder et al 2011 yu et al 2013 mailhot et al 2015 qin et al 2016 this is mainly due to variations in main pollution sources transported into an urban river resulting from rainfall during a storm event fig 1 it is the variation that results in issues in identifying high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed classification strategy can efficiently simplify a problem and it has been widely used in for example medicinal environmental and ecological fields besaw et al 2009 heyes and lott 2017 for example quinn et al 2001 improved the effectiveness of riparian zone management using a framework based on the classification of the riparian zone and liu et al 2014 maximized the benefit of animal production and ecological conservation by designing a functional classification index however few investigations have studied flow concentration relationships on the basis of rainfall classification in an urban watershed accordingly it is currently unknown whether classification based on rainfall is suitable to simplify the identification of storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed the common methods of pollution risk assessment are mainly divided into two categories i probabilistic based approach and ii risk index approach the probabilistic approach is often combined with physically based hydrological water quality models to quantify risk related to water park and roesner 2012 qin et al 2013 wang et al 2017 although this coupled method can overcome a shortage of data it has rarely been used in identifying stormwater pollution risk in an urban watershed reasons for the lack of use are mainly due to distributed and physically based stormwater models such as swmm rossman 2009 storm hec 1977 and sustain epa 2009 require a large amount of data from parameters which are difficult to obtain additionally they cannot represent the random uncertain and sequence characteristics of event based stormwater data egodawatta et al 2014 wijesiri et al 2016 in contrast risk index approach is simpler and has no requirements for a large amount of data from parameters zhao and li 2013 hofmeister et al 2016 however this approach still cannot solve randomness or uncertainty inherent in stormwater sequence data accordingly both limitations of existing methods and the characteristics of event based stormwater data bring great challenge for identifying high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed the cloud model can efficiently address the randomness or uncertainty inherent in a one sequence dataset li and du 2008 deng and wang 2017 for example analysis framework for water quality time series data based on the normal cloud model has been suggested to quantify water quality relationships between a river mainstream and its tributaries deng and wang 2017 therefore we believe the cloud model to be a useful tool to identify storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed however challenges as to how to transform storm flow and storm water quality data from an urban watershed into a cloud model sequence still exist currently urban rivers in southern china are experiencing serious water quality problems especially during rainy days the main objective of this study is to develop a storm flow pollution index using the cloud model to identify high risk pollution intervals posed by storm flow in an urban watershed the development of the storm flow pollution index entails the following tasks i the classification based on rainfall was initially introduced to simplify the identification of high risk pollution intervals ii the cut pool strategy was then introduced to pre process the dataset in preparation for making full use of information hidden in the dataset and investigating the impact of rainfall on high risk pollution intervals iii gaussian cloud distribution was then introduced to capture the trend dispersing extent and randomness of stormwater quality data at any flow interval iv finally similarity measure based on gaussian cloud distribution was used to quantify the possibility of stormwater pollutant load in any flow interval greater than the background in this investigation storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed under different rain events light rain moderate rain and heavy rain are suggested results from this analysis provide important information for urban watershed pollution control decision making 2 methods 2 1 study area and data the shiyan river watershed a representative urban catchment in southern china fig 2 belongs to the source tributary of the rain fed river the watershed has a warm humid subtropical climate with an average annual rainfall of 1933 mm event based rainfall depth in the watershed can vary from 0 to 417 2 mm the shiyan river watershed has experienced rapid urbanization having an area of 25 km2 of which 32 is classified as having an impervious surface residential industrial agricultural and sparse forest land use comprise 10 16 29 and 37 of the area respectively although both combined and separate sewer systems are utilized in the shiyan river watershed a misconnection exists between the two systems due to reconstruction of the sewer system therefore variations in the flow concentration relationship among different rain events in the watershed are exacerbated consequently making it difficult to identify the high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in the urban watershed the dataset used to test the proposed method are twenty six event based storm flow and water quality data from the shiyan river watershed which was collected by qin et al 2016 a summary of the dataset used is i one minute rainfall observation records from the shenzhen meteorology bureau ii streamflow measurements with a temporal resolution of 10 min and iii chemical oxygen demand cod observations with a temporal resolution of 20 min more details about these data are available in qin et al 2016 in addition we collected hourly rainfall time series records from the shenzhen meteorology bureau spanning the last ten years for six sites 2 2 method development 2 2 1 method framework international organization for standardization iso defined risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives iso 2009a b in other words risk is the combination of the likelihood or probability of a hazard resulting in an adverse event and the severity of the event this definition has been widely applied to both flood risk assessments apel et al 2004 wang et al 2015 and landslide risk assessments lu et al 2014 azimi et al 2018 amongst others according to this definition pollution risk related to storm flow can be defined as a combination of the storm flow pollutant flux driven by rain and the possibility of its occurrence in order to quantify the pollution risk of a storm flow the following storm flow pollution index was developed 1 s p i k r p f k 0 p k 0 where s p i k is the storm flow pollution index at the kth flow interval r p f k 0 is the storm flow pollution severity at the kth flow interval and p k 0 is occurrence possibility of r p f k 0 the development flowchart of the storm flow pollution index fig 3 is summarized as step 1 classify the dataset i e the storm flow and quality data according to its rainfall data section 2 2 2 step 2 pre process the dataset and transform it into the cloud model sequence for bridging the raw data and the calculation of storm flow pollution index section 2 2 3 step 3 construct the storm flow pollution index calculate the storm flow pollution severity and its occurrence possibility section 2 2 4 step 4 calculate the index value at any flow interval and identify the high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed 2 2 2 classification of the dataset based on rainfall data classification is an important strategy for simplifying a problem in order to simplify the identification of storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed classification of the dataset the flow and pollutant concentration data based on rainfall data was adopted the common six hour minimum inter event time mit criterion was adopted for defining the independent rain event uson and ramos 2001 dunkerley 2010 the widely used percentile method frich et al 2002 rahmani et al 2016 was used to determine the rainfall threshold value of different rain events finally 10 year hourly rainfall resolution records from six different sites in shenzhen were used to determine rainfall threshold value of different rain events results gained from this method are shown in table 1 2 2 3 transformation of the dataset into the cloud model sequence 2 2 3 1 cut pool strategy cut pool is a data pre processing strategy used to maximize valuable information in an existing dataset and to obtain an overview of the impact of one factor on the target variable especially when significant variation exists in their relationship bach et al 2010 alias et al 2014 for example for function y f x x it varies among events an increment of x was initially chosen and cut into pieces we then observed y from the same x interval among different events that can be pooled together red box thus making it possible to use the majority of data information to investigate the impact of x on y fig 4 in order to obtain an overview of the impact of rainfall on storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed the cut pool strategy was used to pre process the dataset 2 2 3 2 cloud model transformation the cloud model is a novel and promising method for risk assessment which can efficiently address vagueness and uncertainty inherent in a dataset yang et al 2018 more information about cloud model can refer to supplementary material in order to quantify storm flow pollution risk using the cloud model a multiple step backward cloud transformation mbct algorithm xu et al 2014 was used to transform the dataset into the cloud model sequence the flowchart used to transform the dataset into the cloud model sequence is shown in fig 5 and summarized below step 1 determine an increment of the flow i e slice size and cut each event from one classified dataset i e the pollutant concentration values into a slice according to the flow increment step 2 pool together these pollutant concentration values from the same slice i e the same flow interval to obtain the sample collection composed of these pollutant concentration values from the same flow interval i 1 i m s l i c e i j s l i c e j step 3 transform each sample collection from different flow intervals into a normal cloud model represented by three numerical parameters s l i c e j c x j e x j e n x j h e x j using a mbct algorithm finally the dataset the pollutant concentration values under one classified rain event was transformed into a one dimensional normal cloud model sequence thus the physical interpretations of parameters in the development of the storm flow pollution index can be developed based on the original descriptions of parameters table 2 2 2 4 calculation of the storm flow pollution index based on cloud model theory 2 2 4 1 calculation of storm flow pollution severity the storm flow pollution severity at the kth cumulative volume of storm flow can be represented by the ratio of the pollutant flux at the kth cumulative volume of storm flow to that of equal volume base flow rpf k 0 it can be calculated as 2 r p f k 0 p o l l u t a n t f l u x k p o l l u t a n t f l u x 0 3 p o l l u t a n t f l u x k e x k v f l o w i n t e r v a l 4 p o l l u t a n t f

pollutant flux of v f l o w i n t e r v a l flow when no storm occurs v f l o w i n t e r v a l is the volume of flow at each flow interval e x k is mean pollution concentration at the kth flow interval and e x 0 is mean pollution concentration of the receiving water body when no storm occurs thus eqs 2 4 can be simplified as 5 r p f k 0 e x k e x 0 2 2 4 2 calculation of the occurrence possibility of the storm flow pollution severity variable pollutant concentration cumulative volume relationships among rain events results in changeable pollutant flux of the kth flow interval among rain events thus making the storm flow pollution severity uncertain similarity between two one dimensional normal clouds proposed by deng et al 2016 can be used to quantify the similarity of two uncertain datasets in order to quantify the uncertainty of storm flow pollution severity this method was used to calculate the occurrence possibility of r p f k 0 for example using given two cloud models c x 0 e x 0 e n 0 h e 0 and c k e x k e n k h e k representing possible background pollutant concentration values and possible pollutant concentration values at the kth flow interval respectively their expectation curves can be expressed as 6 u 0 exp x e x 0 2 2 e n 0 2 7 u k exp x e x k 2 2 e n k 2 where x is any pollutant concentration value at one flow interval ex is mean pollution concentration en is the measurement of uncertainty of ex u is the gaussian membership degree namely the measurement of any pollutant concentration value belonging to this flow interval and the subscripts k and 0 represent the kth flow interval and the background pollutant concentration without a storm event respectively a summary of the schematic diagram calculating the occurrence possibility of r p f k 0 fig 6 shaded zone is summarized as step 1 calculate the overlap degree o d x k 0 of the expectation curves u 0 and u k 8 o d x k 0 2 min s u p c x 0 s u p c x k max i n f c x

belonging to cloud model c x 0 and c x k respectively satisfying the 3en rule note that o d x k 0 0 1 in this equation o d x k 0 equals zero when no overlapping area satisfies the 3en rule between c x 0 and c x k o d x k 0 equals one when the two cloud models are the same step 2 calculate the gaussian membership degree u k 0 intersection of the expectation curves as 9 u k 0 0 x 1 x 2 e x 0 3 e n 0

are common point forecast problems many indicators such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and the root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 can be used to evaluate the performance of this kind of model in this study however our focus was on its interval identification rather point forecast currently few indicators are suitable to assess the performance of interval identification finally two approaches were available to assess the performance of the proposed method including the interval overlapping ratio ior and load contribution of high risk pollution intervals for this purpose all datasets of light moderate rain events were randomly split into a training dataset 60 and a testing dataset 40 according to the mixed bag approach razavi and tolson 2013 arsenault et al 2018 this process was repeated ten times interval overlapping ratio ior is the agreement of intervals between identified response and measured response deng and guo 2018 for two length equal continuous intervals s s s and m m m representing the estimated and measured intervals respectively there exist five positional relationships denoted as case1 case 5 between them as seen in fig 7 ior can be calculated as follows 13 i o r 0 c a s e 1 c a s e 5 l e n s m l e n m c a s e 2 c a s e 4 1 c a s e 3 where l e n s and l e n m are the length of the continuous intervals s and m respectively they can be calculated as follows 14 l e n s s s 15 l e n m m m where s and s are the upper and lower boundary of interval s respectively m and m are the upper and lower boundary of interval m respectively based on the definition of high risk pollution intervals of storm flow load contribution of high risk pollution intervals of storm flow can be therefore calculated as 16 lc v 20 r i s k l v 20 r i s k l e where lc v 20 r i s k is the load contribution of high risk pollution intervals l v 20 r i s k is the load of high risk pollution intervals and l e is the load of the storm event the index performance is determined either by ior or l v 20 r i s k table 3 the index performance is considered to be good when ior is within 60 100 moderate when 30 60 and bad when 0 30 taking account load contribution of high risk pollution interval lc v 20 risk the index performance is considered to be good when lc v 20 risk is within 40 100 moderate when 25 40 and bad when 0 25 2 4 assessment of robustness the slice size an important parameter in the process of the development of the storm flow pollution index will affect the number of stormwater samples in each flow interval thus affecting the distribution of stormwater pollutant concentration in a flow interval and the accuracy of the model for example a smaller slice size may result in too fewer samples to capture the distribution of pollutant concentration thus failing to identify the high risk pollution interval otherwise higher resolution data is needed which will increase the cost of the experimental analysis in contrast a larger slice size may weaken the difference in the distribution of stormwater pollutant concentration between the two adjacent flow intervals thus leading to a coarse and inaccurate prediction interval determination of slice size should meet two requirements i to guarantee that the number of samples in any flow interval will be greater than 5 10 and ii that the slice size should be less than half of the cumulative volume of a storm flow therefore six different slice sizes 0 6 0 8 1 1 3 1 8 and 2 1 mm were chosen to investigate their impact on high risk pollution intervals the slice size 1 mm was chosen to demonstrated the identification process in this paper 3 results 3 1 a cloud model based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume results for a cloud model based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume under moderate rain fig 8 indicate a trend for flow cod concentration relationship from rain events with the same range rainfall the results also indicate uncertainty of the cod concentration at each flow interval using the mbct algorithm all possible cod concentration values at each flow interval were transformed into a one dimensional normal model represented by three numerical features c x k e x k e n x k h e k results from this analysis were then displayed fig 8 using a forward cloud transformation fct algorithm wang et al 2014 the y axis of each point represented a possible cod concentration value and its x axis represented the relative likelihood of this cod concentration value at this flow interval for example point a 0 8 represented the likelihood of the cod concentration value equaling 500 at the 2 3 mm cumulative volume interval note that the y axis of the red point equal to e x k was the most representative cod concentration value at each flow interval i e the characteristic cod concentration at each flow denoted as cod for convenience whose relative likelihood was highest equaling one entropy en reflected the fluctuation range of cod concentration that is the uncertainty measurement of cod at this flow interval thus the trend of the red points reflected the trend of the flow cod concentration relationship under uncertainty results in fig 8 indicate that cod concentration initially rapidly increased before slowly decreasing with an increase of cumulative volume additionally results for the pearson test indicated that a good correlation existed between expectation ex and entropy en heavy rain did not record a good correlation table 4 this result indicates that uncertainty of the cod concentration was related to cod concentration the exception under heavy rain was mainly due to the bias estimate of these parameters resulting from only two heavy rain events 3 2 storm flow pollution index for identifying high risk pollution intervals the storm flow pollution index developed using the cloud model reflects the relative pollution risk of storm flow at any flow interval compared with situations without a storm event a larger storm flow pollution index value indicates a higher pollution risk and a value greater than one indicates that a pollution risk exists results for the relationship between the storm flow pollution index and the cumulative volume fig 9 a recorded a gradual decrease from 1 51 to 0 09 for the storm flow pollution index when cumulative volume increased from 1 to 5 mm under light rain 0 13 mm in contrast the storm flow pollution index initially increased from 1 39 to 4 69 when cumulative volume increased from 1 to 2 mm under moderate rain 13 1 27 mm before decreasing to 0 39 when cumulative volume increased from 2 to 9 mm however under heavy rain 27 1 45 mm the index results initially increased from 0 74 to 4 42 when cumulative volume increased from 1 to 6 mm before rapidly decreasing to 0 01 when cumulative volume increased from 8 to 10 mm the high risk cod pollution interval of a storm flow can be identified by comparing the storm flow pollution index of each flow interval in the shiyan river storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals were 0 5 1 5 mm under light rain 1 3 mm under moderate rain and 5 7 mm under heavy rain the corresponding storm flow pollution indices were 1 38 1 51 2 85 4 69 and 4 35 4 36 respectively this result indicates that storm flow pollution risk was greatest under moderate rain followed by heavy rain and light rain this is mainly because pollutant flux largely depends on wash off and transportation capacity of storm flow and its dilution effect as rainfall increased from light rain to heavy rain more runoff is generally generated and more pollutants will be washed off and transported into the river the dilution effect will also increase at the same time however wash off and transportation capacity of storm flow dominates in moderate rain events while its dilution effect dominates in heavy rain events moreover the storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals tended to shift backwards as rainfall increased from light rain to moderate rain to heavy rain 3 3 performance assessment of the proposed index in this section interval overlapping ratio ior and load contribution of high risk pollution intervals l c v 20 r i s k were used to assess the performance of the presented method fig 10 ior was used to assess the agreement between the identified high risk cod pollution intervals and the measured as described in table 5 ior under light rain was 66 and 63 for training and testing respectively in moderate rain results were 64 and 67 respectively a lower ior value 55 for training recorded under heavy rain was mainly due to only two heavy rain events occurring in the studied time period this result indicates that the proposed method has a good performance of identifying high risk cod pollution intervals the good performance owed to that both the ratio of the cod flux and the possibility of its occurrence were taken into account using the cloud model fig 9b and c l c v 20 r i s k was used to assess the load contribution of storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals as seen in table 5 the load contribution of high risk pollution intervals under light rain was 49 and 43 for training and testing respectively in moderate rain results were 48 and 44 respectively as expected we found that 20 volume storm flow can on average control 40 50 cod load when focusing on high risk pollution intervals of storm flow 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of the proposed method 4 1 1 representation for the event based flow concentration relationships cod concentration for each cumulative volume interval fig 11 show that the relationship between mean or median cod concentration and cumulative volume initially rapidly increased before decreasing slowly with an increase in cumulative volume this result was in agreement with the cloud model based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume fig 8 cod concentration with cumulative volume also recorded significant fluctuations indicating that there was uncertainty inherent in cod concentration of each flow interval this being in agreement with the entropy results fig 8 in addition it can be seen that each value point was a different shade of color indicating that the distribution of cod concentration was not uniform at each flow interval this difference shows that the cloud model based flow concentration relationship had a good representation for the event based flow concentration relationship for rain events with the same range rainfall event based relationships between cod concentration and cumulative volume at the outlet of the shiyan river from different rain events but with the same rainfall range fig 12 were generally consistent except for a few exceptions such as the small rain events on the 2011 09 02 or 2011 09 08 fig 12a results in fig 12 indicate that the rainfall based classification idea was generally reasonable a few exceptions can be explained by the difference in the characteristics of different rain events such as rainfall intensity and antecedent dry periods liu et al 2013 salim et al 2019 however this relationship varied from one rain event to another even under rain events with same range rainfall this also shows the necessity of investigating the flow concentration relationship based on rainfall data accordingly the cloud model based flow concentration relationship had a good representation for the event based flow concentration relationship under rain events with the same range rainfall on the one hand it visualized the trend of flow concentration from rain events with the same range rainfall on the other hand it visualized the uncertain nature of pollution concentration at each flow interval 4 1 2 impact of rainfall depth on the flow concentration relationship rainfall has a significant influence on the flow concentration relationship especially at the watershed scale this is mainly because the pollutant concentration depends on the wash off effect and the dilution effect of the storm flow however variations in the flow concentration relationship among storm events and its uncertainty made it difficult to investigate the impact of rainfall on the flow concentration relationship using the proposed method we investigated the impact of rainfall on the flow cod concentration relationship fig 12a at the same time the impact of rainfall on the relationship between the cumulative cod flux and the cumulative volume was also investigated fig 12b it is worth noting that with rainfall increasing from light rain to moderate rain to heavy rain the peak cod concentration gradually shifted back and there would be more volume high concentration storm flow fig 12a this largely accounted for the difference in the high risk pollution intervals among different events suggesting we should identify high risk pollution intervals based on rainfall data to undertake pollution control strategies in addition an s curve relationship between cumulative cod flux and cumulative volume was evident similar to that recorded for the growth curve however this s curve relationship was distorted under light or moderate rain similar to the early stages under heavy rain fig 12b this result indicates that pollutants transported into the river under light or moderate rain was only a fraction of that transported under heavy rain this finding mainly occurs as the migration energy of storm flow is relatively small under light rain and only a small amount of easily washed off pollutants mainly from the effective impervious surface attached to small particle street dust are transported into the river as rainfall increases from light to heavy rain storm flow energy gradually increases resulting in pollutants which are harder to wash off from non effective impervious surfaces pipeline sediments and riverbeds gradually being transported into the river fig 1 however the phenomenon that the last part of the cumulative cod flux cumulative volume curve increased very slowly under heavy rain indicated that available washed off pollutants would reduce when cumulative volume increased to a certain extent and that the dilution effect of storm flow would gradually become dominant overall compared with the event based relationship between cod concentration and cumulative volume fig 10 our method can more clearly reflect the impact of rainfall on the flow cod concentration relationship as well as on the cumulative volume cumulative cod flux relationship it also largely explains differences in the high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in an urban watershed among different rainfall event types thorndahl and willems 2008 schroeder et al 2011 yu et al 2013 mailhot et al 2015 qin et al 2016 4 2 the robustness of the proposed method six different slice sizes 0 6 0 8 1 1 3 1 8 and 2 1 mm were chosen to investigate the impact of slice size on high risk pollution intervals results in fig 13 show that the cumulative volume vs storm flow pollution index relationship curve became smoother as the slice size increased this indicated that predicted pollution risk would be lower when a larger slice size was selected such as a slice size of 2 1 however noise occurred when a smaller slice size was selected such as a slice size of 0 6 this difference can be explained by the dilution effect of water when choosing a large size slice however slice size had little impact on the accuracy of the identified high risk pollution intervals of storm flow in the urban watershed for instance the storm flow pollution index peak was within fixed flow intervals regardless of the slice size and the rain event accordingly the proposed method for predicting the high risk pollution intervals is not sensitive to slice size 4 3 further considerations although the proposed method had a good performance for the shiyan river watershed more studies are required in other watersheds to verify the applicability of this method in addition we should not ignore the following facts 1 significant differences in the relationship between different pollutants and cumulative volume in urban watersheds exist xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 2 apart from rainfall depth other characteristics such as rain intensity rainfall duration can affect the wash off process of pollutants liu et al 2013 gong et al 2016 and 3 watershed characteristics such as land use and population density can also affect the accumulation and wash off of pollutants rodriguez hernandez et al 2013 li et al 2015 these factors affect the storm flow concentration relationship in an urban watershed thus affecting storm flow high risk pollution intervals therefore further research is needed to improve this method for example we can attempt to explore the high risk pollution intervals of other pollutants in storm flow from an urban watershed such as total suspended solids ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus etc additionally we can investigate storm flow high risk pollution intervals in an urban watershed based on different classification standards of rain event such as only considering rainfall intensity or rainfall depth or one comprehensively considering rain intensity rainfall depth and rainfall duration furthermore it is possible to investigate the effect of watershed characteristics finally as pollutant concentration tends to be lower in a large watershed due to dilution effects and the volume of polluted water can be too large to be accommodated and treated the proposed method is applicable to a small urban watershed 2 30 km2 5 conclusions a storm flow pollution index model identifying storm flow high risk pollution intervals of an urban watershed was developed using a cloud model method a high temporal resolution dataset of an urban watershed located in shenzhen southern china was used to develop and demonstrated the proposed method our results show that the cloud model based flow cod concentration relationship can visualize not only the trend of the flow cod concentration relationship from rain events with the same range rainfall it can also identify the uncertainty of the cod concentration at each flow interval results indicate that storm flow high risk cod pollution intervals of the shiyan watershed was 0 5 1 5 mm under light rain 1 3 mm under moderate rain and 5 7 mm under heavy rain the accuracy of the identified high risk pollution intervals ior was 63 66 under light rain 64 67 under moderate rain these results implied that the proposed model had a good performance for identifying the storm flow high risk pollution intervals of an urban watershed based on rainfall data results also show chemical oxygen demand cod load can be reduced by 44 48 with high risk storm flow under light rain 43 49 under moderate rain 32 under heavy rain this suggests that controlling high risk storm flow can achieve greater load reduction results further show that the proposed method made it possible to investigate the impact of rainfall on the flow concentration relationship with rainfall being shown to be a main reason for differences in high risk pollution intervals among different events this finding suggests that pollution control strategies can be formulated based on storm flow high risk pollution intervals of an urban watershed accordingly this method is very useful for urban watershed pollution control decision making
