19550,seawater treatment is increasingly required due to industrial activities that use substantial volumes of seawater in their processes the shipping industry and the associated management of a ship s ballast water are currently considered a global challenge for the seas related to that the suitability of an electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop with boron doped diamond bdd electrodes has been assessed on a laboratory scale for the disinfection of seawater this technology can produce both reactive oxygen species and chlorine species especially in seawater that are responsible for inactivation the eaop was applied in a continuous flow regime with real seawater natural marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb were used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency a biphasic inactivation kinetic model was fitted on experimental points achieving 4 log reductions at 0 019 ah l 1 by assessing regrowth after treatment results suggest that higher bacterial damages result from the eaop when it is compared to chlorination furthermore several issues lacking fundamental understanding were investigated such as recolonization capacity or bacterial community dynamics it was concluded that despite disinfection processes being effective there is not only a possibility for regrowth after treatment but also a change on bacterial population diversity produced by the treatment finally energy consumption was estimated and indicated that 0 264 kwh m 3 are needed for 4 8 log reductions of mhb otherwise with 0 035 kwh m 3 less disinfection efficiency can be obtained 2 2 log red however with a residual oxidant in the solution total inactivation can be achieved in three days graphical abstract image 1 keywords ballast water treatment marine bacteria chlorine active species ros recolonization bacterial diversity 1 introduction the treatment of seawater has experienced increased interest related to industrial activities that utilize substantial volumes of seawater in processes such as aquaculture or shipping it implies associated risks due to the control of pathogens or undesired biofouling that must be prevented de schryver and vadstein 2014 oh et al 2010 tanaka et al 2013 maritime transport deserves special attention in 2015 world seaborne trade volumes were estimated to have exceeded ten billion tons which means that 80 of international trade is conducted by sea unctad 2016 related to that an emerging challenge associated with a ship s ballast water has been related to the introduction of aquatic invasive species currently it is considered as the fourth greatest threat to the world s oceans gef undp imo 2017 unctad 2016 thus the international convention on the management of ships ballast water and sediments bwmc was adopted in 2004 and has recently been entered into force september 2017 imo 2004 among several specific aspects the bwmc requires that ballast water must be treated in accordance with discharge limits established in rule d2 it distinguished five organism groups with three being indicator microbes e coli enterococci and v cholerae these microbiological standards are proposed in order to avoid the introduction of undesired aquatic microorganisms bacterial indicators are otherwise primarily centered on human health concerns and do not consider the risks associated with other coastal activities it specifically implies to additional aquatic bacteria or viruses which could cause epidemics epizootics or other ecosystem consequences besides some authors indicate that specific indicator microbes standards that are established in the bwmc were identified at low concentrations in ballast water samples cohen and dobbs 2015 lymperopoulou and dobbs 2017 in parallel other studies showed the high diversity of marine bacteria in ballast tanks brinkmeyer 2016 lymperopoulou and dobbs 2017 which suggests that other bacterial indicators such as marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb should be incorporated into the regulations nevertheless the entry into force of the bwmc requires the implementation of seawater disinfection systems in this aspect several studies have been conducted to propose a number of options for treating ballast water that take into account environmental technical and economic criteria lloyd s register maritime 2017 tsolaki and diamadopoulos 2010 a number of challenges in this regard are the ability of working with high ballasting and discharge flow rates as well as ensuring their effectiveness in seawater that is characterized by high salinity and high microbiological activity on the other hand even though a wide range of studies focused on treatment efficiency there is limited literature focusing on side effects caused by disinfection it implies the regrowth potential in ballast tanks grob and pollet 2016 or the hazards associated with the alteration on dynamics of bacterial communities after disinfection which seems to be an emerging challenge hess erga et al 2010 chemical disinfection such as chlorination or using several biocides is problematic if it needs to be used onboard due to the transport and storage of active substances besides depending on the water matrix composition the generation of hazardous by products could be an issue of major concern werschkun et al 2012 uv disinfection is another well established method for this purpose however it has a disadvantage which is the repair mechanisms of microorganisms and consequential regrowth especially in these types of waters grob and pollet 2016 moreno andrés et al 2018 romero martínez et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as an alternative option for water treatment they have mainly been focused on the disinfection of drinking water and the removal of hardly biodegradable organic pollutants in wastewaters chaplin 2014 comninellis and chen 2010 however aops in seawater have been poorly developed for these purposes aguilar et al 2017 moreno andrés et al 2017 rubio et al 2013 särkkä et al 2015 an attractive alternative is the in situ generation of oxidant species as in the case of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops they have gained significance through the years by providing high efficiency in drinking water and in both industrial and domestic wastewater treatment systems chaplin 2014 garcia segura et al 2017 moreira et al 2017 särkkä et al 2015 even in ballast water or aquaculture applications high inactivation rates have been reached e g with low energy requirements for e coli nanayakkara et al 2012 as well as in different types of marine organisms cha et al 2015 oh et al 2010 tanaka et al 2013 tsolaki et al 2010 however these studies used active electrodes with low oxygen evolution overpotential this only permits the application of low currents before oxygen evolution begins and consequently competitive reactions occur that result in the major consumption of radical species and thus lower efficiency comninellis and chen 2010 jeong et al 2009 additionally active electrodes also favor the direct oxidation of chloride ions at the electrode surface to form chlorine garcia segura et al 2017 jeong et al 2006 panizza and cerisola 2009 with the aim to assess powerful oxidizing treatments that could achieve high disinfection efficiency together with the avoidance of bacterial regrowth the use of non active electrodes can be a valid candidate for seawater treatment vacca et al 2013 with non active electrodes higher efficiencies in the electro generation of reactive oxygen species ros can be achieved due to the high overpotential for oxygen evolution eqs 1 4 garcia segura et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 vacca et al 2013 thus a combination of ros oxidation and active chlorine generation could take part in disinfection mechanisms jeong et al 2006 therefore among the major advantages of the non active materials such as the high mechanical strength and chemical inertness oh are physisorbed on the anode surface and higher inactivation rates may be reached i e non active anode promotes oh diffusion to the bulk and reduces competing reactions comninellis and chen 2010 jeong et al 2009 moreira et al 2017 1 h2o oh h e 2 oh o h e 3 o o2 o3 4 oh oh h2o2 a clear example is the use of boron doped diamond bdd as anode material chaplin 2014 it has previously been studied for disinfection of seawater e g lacasa et al 2013 evaluated disinfection efficiency on artemia salina and e coli petrucci et al 2013 obtained strong inactivation effects for marine dinoflagellates and marine bacterium p aeruginosa however those studies work either at batch mode implies an electrolysis time in the order of minutes or at very low flow rates an aspect that is not feasible in the case of ballast water treatments bwts that require high ballasting deballasting flow rates in this context the eaop with bdd electrodes was evaluated and their operation was optimized for disinfection of seawater by assessing both inactivation kinetics and regrowth capability following treatment the application of this process in a continuous flow regime with real seawater and natural marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb as an indicator of disinfection efficiency is the main novelty aspect furthermore an approach of bacterial community dynamics after treatment has been performed this is a factor that is extremely challenging in the case of ballast water discharges finally a comparison of the disinfection efficiency between the eaop and naocl added as a chemical has been performed to investigate the bacterial survival on both processes 2 material and methods 2 1 water sampling seawater sw samples were collected from trondheimfjord trondheim norway sw was pumped from 70 m deep at sealab ntnu centre of fisheries and aquaculture and following the sand filter step they were collected in 25 l tanks and used as a water matrix for experimental assays physicochemical characterization of the water used in the experiments was performed table 1 including conductivity ph temperature hq430d hach and turbidity 2100an hach laboratory turbidimeter a total organic carbon toc analysis was conducted using an apollo 9000 toc analyzer alkalinity was determined by a titration using hydrochloric acid hcl 0 02m avs titrinorm vrw different ions were analyzed by ion chromatography 881 compact ic pro 882 compact ic plus metrohm with detection by conductivity 2 2 electrolytic cell and experimental set up experiments were performed in a diaclean lab unit waterdiam with electrolytic cell diaclean 106 101 which consists of two monopolar circular si bdd electrodes boron doped diamond on silicon substrate their active surface is 70 cm2 with an electrode gap of 1 mm the electrical power was supplied by a dc power supply diaclean ps 1000 polarity reversal function with tunable frequencies the range of possible applied current was between 0 6 up to 19 a 2 2 1 inactivation assays experiments were conducted in a single pass with seawater pumped in once from the storage tank 20 l through the electrolytic cell at different flow rates 200 1000 l h 1 and various current values 0 7 7 3a which corresponds to current density ranging between 9 72 and 101 38 ma cm 2 and implying different electrical charges applied q fig a1 supp material theoretical retention time trt on electrolytic cell ranged from 0 13 to 0 03 s before each battery of assays the lab unit was cleaned and disinfected with sodium hypochlorite and then rinsed with sterile water during this cleaning procedure polarity was automatically inverted every 10 min to avoid operational problems such as the formation of coatings or any material on the electrode surfaces from previous runs each sample was collected in a sterile 250 ml flask at the outlet once the flow rate was stabilized first a similar volume to the total system volume was wasted and the sample was subsequently collected in an ascending flow rate to avoid possible microbiological contamination at the beginning of the assay a control sample was taken to determine the initial bacterial concentration additionally a mechanical stress control was done by performing a run at 0 ma cm 2 no changes with the control were detected samples in the same experimental series were taken during a time lapse of 20 min maximum and stored in a cool dark place until microbiological analysis each sample different flow rate current was collected in two sterile flasks one was collected with a quenching agent in order to determine survival bacterial and assure that the electro generated total residual oxidants tro did not have bactericidal effects after treatment the other was collected by keeping the tro in a solution with the aim of assessing the residual effects after treatment 2 2 2 recolonization assays survival and recolonization of marine heterotrophic bacteria were investigated after the disinfection procedures by replicating a system of ballast water treatment in which water was stored in ballast tanks during a voyage in this context five samples were selected in varying degrees of inactivation produced by different values of the tro that was generated unt s1 s2 s3 s4 with unt being the untreated sample initial control the experimental procedure was similar to the previous section collecting samples in 250 ml flasks previously sterilized by autoclave collecting them twice quenching the tro and keeping it in a solution the five samples unt s1 s2 s3 s4 were stored in the dark at 20 c each day the bacterial concentration and tro were measured according to sections 2 3 and 2 4 respectively each battery of assays was repeated in three independent moments statistical differences between each sample with controls were evaluated by analysis of variance anova using statgraphics centurion xvii version 17 0 16 statpoints technologies inc 2 3 microbiological procedures natural marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb was assessed as an indicator of disinfection efficiency following imo recommendations bwmc g8 guideline a minimum concentration of 104 colony forming unit cfu per ml is needed for inactivation assays to obtain that concentration and secure good statistics yeast extract was added as a substrate for mhb four equal amounts were added at 0 3 6 and 12 h total of 2 μg ml 1 all assays began 48 h after water sampling bacterial survival after treatment was assessed by colony counting samples were plated in triplicate on petri dishes with difco marine agar 2216 detection limit 2 cfu ml 1 petri plates were inverted and incubated at 20 c for five days to assure valid counts on petri plates ten fold dilutions were performed and the majority of agar plates used for quantification had 10 150 cfu with three replicates per sample we obtained a coefficient variation of 30 after yeast extract additions the initial concentration of mhb was approximately 106 cfu ml 1 which gives a disinfection detection limit of 5 70 decimal log units log n n0 sterile conditions were monitored with plating blank samples during the microbiological analytical procedure 2 3 1 estimates of bacterial diversity a plate count method based on the time required to form macroscopically visible colonies tv days was used tv is linearly related to the maximum specific growth rate therefore divides the culturable mhb into categories based on their maximum growth rate this is a simple methodology that requires no specialized equipment and is applicable for describing the community structure with special reference to r k theory salvesen and vadstein 2000 the procedure followed the protocol of salvesen and vadstein 2000 briefly samples from three independent experiments were spread in triplicate on agar and incubated at 20 c each day during a period of eight days an untreated sample was used as a model of natural seawater i e freshly collected water samples cfus were counted regularly after plating to obtain differences in the frequency distribution of visible colonies as a function of time after plating colonies had to have a diameter 0 2 mm to be considered visible thus colonies that belonged to bacterial groups with high growth rates would be visible on the first or second day after plating whereas those with slower growth rates would take longer to develop visible colonies in this aspect with the aim of obtaining a parameter with biological interpretation the percentage of rapidly grown colonies was obtained i e colonies that showed tv 1 and 2 in respect to the total this is directly related to the theory of r and k strategists because opportunistic bacteria r strategists are distinct from non opportunistic k strategists according to their high maximum growth rate de schryver and vadstein 2014 salvesen and vadstein 2000 2 3 2 microbiological data analysis modeling of inactivation kinetics was performed according to different types of microbial survival models geeraerd et al 2005 the most suitable for this case was the biphasic model according to eq 5 cerf 1977 5 n n 0 f e k 1 q 1 f e k 2 q parameters in the model are electrical charge applied q ah l 1 first and second disinfection rate constants k1 k2 l ah 1 and the fraction of the initial organisms that follows a fast disinfection route f associated to k1 the validity of this model was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse for regrowth analysis the percentage of bacterial regrowth was calculated according to eq 6 based on the concentration of viable bacteria cfu ml 1 before n0 and after n disinfection treatment as well as in the regrowth sample nt lindenauer and darby 1994 6 r e p a i r n t n n 0 n 100 2 4 chemicals and analytical methods in addition to the eaop application parallel assays were performed with sodium hypochlorite naclo solution 10 w v sigma aldrich added as a chemical in order to compare the effects of electro generated tro in bacterial inactivation sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate na2s2o3 5h2o sigma aldrich was used for tro quenching at a ratio of 3 mol of na2s2o3 5h2o for every mol of chlorine in the samples it was placed in sterile flasks before sampling in order to achieve instant tro neutralization the colorimetric dpd method was used as an analytical method for the determination of oxidant species it is accepted for water analysis by standard protocols epa method 330 5 standard method 4500 cl g in both wastewater and drinking water as well as being recommended for seawater cha et al 2015 this method is based on the oxidation of n n diethyl p phenylendiamin dpd in the presence of oxidants the color intensity was measured with a hach dr 2000 spectrophotometer it should be noted that in addition to chlorine other possible oxidants can be electro generated and also react with dpd ghasemian et al 2017 therefore results are represented as tro and expressed as mg cl2 l 1 temperature ph and conductivity were measured throughout the experimental samples and variations with respect to the control untreated samples were not detected 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetic assays a battery of assays was performed in order to define inactivation kinetics of the mhb after the eaop the dose response curve is depicted in fig 1 in which the decimal logarithm of bacterial reduction log n n0 versus the electrical charge applied q is represented the experimental points exhibit a good fit r2 0 947 rmse 0 392 for the biphasic inactivation model eq 5 cerf 1977 geeraerd et al 2005 through a non linear adjustment of the experimental points kinetic rate constants were obtained k1 and k2 l ah 1 this indicates two different phases of disinfection primary inactivation with a first order rate constant k1 followed by a tailing deviation with k2 the f parameter is associated with k1 and determines the population rate that is inactivated in the first phase i e f 99 96 s e 0 0004 of the entire population are inactivated with k1 1082 32 l ah 1 s e 75 62 the remaining 0 04 is inactivated with a k2 that is near to zero 96 33 l ah 1 s e 84 69 additionally a number of calculations of interest can be made by obtaining the q necessary to reach a 4 log reduction 0 019 ah l 1 or a 3 log reduction 0 007 ah l 1 which permits an easy comparison of disinfection efficacy when different kinetic models are applied moreno andrés et al 2017 the same levels of inactivation were achieved for other authors e g 0 01 0 02 ah l 1 are needed for total inactivation of e coli cano et al 2012 lacasa et al 2013 other authors such as anfruns estrada et al 2017 work in different operation regimes and reach at least a 4 log reduction of diverse types of bacteria at current densities of 33 3 ma cm 2 and between 20 and 90 min residence time in this study higher inactivation rates were obtained with current density values of 95 ma cm 2 but with a residence time of 0 13 s in the maximum case inactivation pathways on the eaops are derived from two different disinfection mechanisms known as direct at electrode surface or indirect inactivation fig a1 supp material moreira et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 särkkä et al 2015 the latter is the result of oxidants species produced either by water oxidation or by substances that are dissolved in water which in our case is the use of seawater with high concentrations of chloride ions however other species such as sulfate or hydrogencarbonate can electro generate additional oxidant species such as peroxydisulfate or peroxodicarbonate which can be involved in disinfection processes garcia segura et al 2017 the oxidation of chlorides on an anode surface leads to the formation of free chlorine which is consequently hydrolyzed to form hypochlorous acid hclo hypochlorite ion clo depending on the ph of the solution in that context the chlorine active species cas that were generated were represented according to the electrical charge applied q fig 2 according to fig 2 a linear trend is observed at least by the q values that cover the entire inactivation kinetics afterwards a quadratic expression applies suggesting that the generation of oxidizing species will reach a limit fig 2 outerbox in this aspect oxygen evolution will be the dominant process instead of the electro generation of oxidant species ghasemian et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 according to that a direct relationship between the tro generation and disinfection efficiency can be assumed on inactivation kinetics nevertheless this aspect will be discussed later in section 3 4 on the other hand the use of bdd electrodes as non active anode material has a main disadvantage which is the production of noxious ionic species chlorate perchlorates bromates as a result of further oxidation of both cas and bromide compounds bergmann et al 2009 oh et al 2010 vacca et al 2013 in this context vacca et al 2013 studied the behavior of both of these compounds with the eaop on the bdd electrodes and concluded that when cl and br are both present in a solution disinfection by products dbps will depend primarily on the chloride concentration because the generation of active chlorine is the quickest reaction thus when the chloride concentration is in the amounts of seawater in the order of 10 g l 1 bromate production is almost completely inhibited during the electrolysis process vacca et al 2013 additionally this speciation is significantly affected by both applied current density and flow rate i e low current densities with high flow rates can reduce the formation of hazardous dbps bergmann et al 2009 cano et al 2012 according to the results obtained our current density work range was 9 72 101 38 ma cm 2 with flow rates ranging from 200 to 1000 l h 1 according to bergmann et al 2009 a small influence on perchlorate concentration is detected with flow rates 200 l h 1 otherwise cano et al 2012 did not detect hazardous by products even at a trace level with current density values of 0 13 1 3 ma cm 2 which are quite low values compared to this study hence high inactivation rates have been reached with both higher current densities as well as higher flow rates in terms of q operational values similar to those of cano et al 2012 were achieved nevertheless one of the most significant challenges for the eaops is the up scaling from lab scale to full scale therefore future studies are recommended to carefully investigate dbps under real operating conditions such as high flow rates 3 2 recolonization after treatment it is known that bacteria can regrow even after an apparent successful disinfection treatment grob and pollet 2016 in order to study this regrowth capability four samples were selected in different degrees of inactivation and thus differently generated tro s1 s2 s3 s4 all details appear in table 2 different strategies could be utilized after chemical disinfection in this study two approaches were taken i quenching the tro or ii keeping it in solution in fig 3 it can be observed how the mhb can evolve after treatment under these two strategies when the tro was neutralized after treatment the data reflects that bacteria can recover within two days regardless of the disinfection degree that was reached fig 3a significant differences between each treatment with controls were detected on s2 s4 samples on day 0 p 0 05 otherwise no statistical differences were found between the treated samples compared with the control 48 h after treatment i e treated samples were statistically equal to the control from day 2 onwards in this case recolonization occurred within two days fig 3a which is what happens with other types of treatments hess erga et al 2010 romero martínez et al 2016 this scenario take place with a majority of chemical options for bwts that are used to treat waters at the uptake or at the discharge with the consequential neutralization of the residual oxidant before it enters into ballast tanks this is to avoid active substances than can cause either toxic effects or corrosion in tanks lloyd s register maritime 2017 on the other hand no regrowth is observed if the tro is kept in solution regardless of the oxidant concentration fig 3b in this case statistical differences p 0 05 were obtained in all of the treated samples when compared with the control from day 1 until the end of the experiment here the diffusion of tro into the cells may act as an extra factor of inactivation after treatment the high level of cellular aggressions caused by ros may facilitate the diffusion of the disinfectant into the cell in a post treatment scenario according to the results that were obtained it seems to be sufficient for growth inhibition following the strategy in which the tro is kept in a solution in order to prevent regrowth monitoring the tro decay is required this ensures that the oxidant concentration does not exceed the maximal discharge limit concentration e g 0 5 mg l 1 according to mepc 159 55 for the discharge of treated effluents by onboard wastewater treatment systems no tro discharge standard currently exists for ballast water in this sense the tro concentration was monitored over 16 days by simulating a ballast tank results are depicted in fig 4 in the case of samples with high generated tro s3 s4 10 30 mg l 1 complete removal was not detected within 16 days samples with 1 and 5 mg l 1 s1 s2 did not show detectable levels of tro at the end of the test i e the tro was completely removed on the second day s1 while in s2 complete removal was reached on the fourth day it is an advantage when treatment is performed at the ballast water uptake whereby treated water can maintain low concentrations of tro and total inactivation can be achieved during the ship s voyage fig 3b and fig 4 additionally at the moment of discharge the levels of the tro will be below discharge limits this strategy is in accordance with echardt and kornmueller 2009 3 3 effects on bacterial community composition apart from the importance of regrowth in ballast ships tanks the changes in the bacterial community evolution is a strategic factor that must be monitored the effects caused by disinfection treatments can result in increased levels of dissolved organic carbon that facilitates recolonization of surviving bacteria in receiving waters as can be seen in section 3 2 besides recolonization bacterial succession dynamics are important in the way that the absence of competition low bacterial concentrations after disinfection allows easy growth for bacteria with high specific growth rates usually known as opportunists or r strategists according to that an approach of the bacterial community succession has been performed based on the time required to form macroscopically visible colonies tv as is explained in section 2 3 1 thus lower tv values are associated with bacterial groups exhibiting higher specific growth rates and could be related to opportunistic bacteria these are often the opportunistic pathogens meanwhile higher tv values are associated with k strategists which could be representative of an ecosystem with a stable environment where high interspecific competition select slow growing specialists salvesen and vadstein 2000 this theory has direct consequences on microbial ecology and ballast water implications de schryver and vadstein 2014 hess erga et al 2010 litchman 2010 selected cases for samples taken on days 1 2 4 and 8 after treatment are represented in fig 5 the percentage of bacteria that was visible on days 1 and 2 i e tv 1 and 2 in respect to the total bacterial community can be observed they are associated with r strategists with higher growth rates thus are so called fast growers the specific data and tv values appear in table a 1 supp data it is important to emphasize that the data represent the case when the tro was quenched after treatment on the contrary no regrowth was detected section 3 2 according to fig 5 it can be determined that the percentage of fast growers is higher in treated samples than in those that are untreated assuming that bacterial groups with higher growth rates prevail in treated samples for example on the first two days after treatment more than 50 of the colonies in all of the treated samples are considered r strategists in untreated samples a steady distribution is observed i e the percentage of fast growers does not exceed 35 on the first two days of incubation after a succession process days 4 8 those differences seem to diminish for instance s1 and s2 decrease considerably in the percentage of fast growers otherwise for samples s3 and s4 in which a higher electrical dose q was applied the colonies of rapid growth are still above 50 that means that variations in bacterial communities after storage can occur and it seems to be related to treatment strength this transitory shift in bacterial communities can be due to several factors these factors include the greater availability of nutrients for surviving bacteria the increase of biodegradable fraction due to the modification of organic matter after treatment that consequently rises on substrate availability or a possible increase in resistance mechanisms after oxidative damages for specific bacterial groups becerra castro et al 2016 hess erga et al 2010 moreno andrés et al 2018 thus despite the fact that disinfection processes can be effective a bacterial succession process can occur and consequently different bacterial groups may be dominant according to the data obtained it suggests that a monopolization of rapidly growing bacteria dominates the system treated samples at least during the first days although it is a poorly explored issue some studies accord with this trend in both wastewater becerra castro et al 2016 and seawater hess erga et al 2010 it is probable that the increase in opportunistic bacteria associated with high growth rates could dominate a disturbed environment such as a post disinfection scenario in the event of ballast tanks or receiving harbor areas this may also enhance the invasive potential of aquatic invasive microbes which could lead to serious ecological economic and health consequences drillet 2016 litchman 2010 especially because many genus of pathogens are usually detected in dominated r selected communities vadstein et al in prep this aspect is very important in ballast water implications because all of these scenarios can interfere with different ballast water management strategies in this sense in depth studies are recommended to specifically evaluate possible changes in bacterial diversity after disinfection of ballast water 3 4 bacterial survival concerning to the treatment aeop and chlorination finally all of the results discussed in the previous sections are directly related to inactivation mechanisms that are associated with the disinfection processes in this aspect electrochemical processes in seawater are primarily applied for the generation of cas särkkä et al 2015 stehouwer et al 2015 tanaka et al 2013 additionally it has been demonstrated that ros generated in electrochemical disinfection implies higher disinfection efficiency jeong et al 2006 with the aim of assessing a specific cas role on bacterial inactivation it was independently evaluated by adding naocl in order to achieve the same concentrations of tro as those assessed in samples s1 s4 naocl was added in a single dosage and the evolution of the mhb was evaluated in the different microcosm experiments such as those in section 3 2 i e by keeping the tro in a solution only slight differences of instantaneous inactivation were obtained compared to the eaop data not shown however on the contrary the evolution after treatment differs significantly consequently the percentage of regrowth after treatment was calculated according to eq 6 and is represented in fig 6 according to fig 6 the regrowth of the mhb occurs according to different levels of added chlorine i e s1 1 mg l 1 reaches the higher values of bacterial regrowth followed by s2 and s3 5 10 mg l 1 and negative values were obtained in s4 it must be remembered that according to section 3 2 the regrowth percentage remained negative for all of the samples when electro generated tro is kept in a solution fig 3b thus greater cellular damage occurs on the eaop compared to naocl suggesting that different oxidant species besides cas are involved in disinfection mechanisms and prevent the regrowth after treatment as stated in section 3 1 the inactivation of microorganisms in an electrolytic cell follows both direct and indirect oxidation processes direct inactivation requires bacterial adherence on the anode surface in this regard ghasemian et al 2017 studied the role of bacterial adhesion on electrodes surfaces and no high inactivation rates were detected whereas it mainly depended on the type of bacteria in addition two main indirect oxidation mechanisms are derived from either water quality which is mainly influenced by chloride concentration or water oxidation the electro oxidation of water generates different ros eqs 1 4 which can play an important role in disinfection mechanisms in this sense several studies considered a variety electrode materials jeong et al 2009 selective hydroxyl radical probe compounds jing and chaplin 2017 or electrolyte systems muff et al 2011 to determine the specific production of oh in the eaops all confirmed the high production of oh when non active electrodes bdd were used jeong et al 2009 specifically state that oh production by the bdd electrodes was approximately ten times higher compared to active electrodes additionally it can be assumed that chemical disinfection efficiency depends on the type of disinfectant while cas does not cause cell surface damage i e disinfection mechanisms are based on inner cell components cho et al 2010 oh are able to inactivate cells by mainly causing membrane or wall damages resulting in major cell injury fiorentino et al 2015 thus the higher bacterial damage that avoids regrowth detected in this study in comparison with naocl could be attributed to the electro generation of several ros such as oh h2o2 and o3 jeong et al 2009 2006 the use of seawater as an efficient electrolyte not only implies the generation of chlorine active species cas but can also generate reactive oxygen species ros which probably are responsible for the inhibition of bacterial regrowth thus future studies are recommended with the aim to define the specific role of both ros specially oh and cas on the inactivation mechanisms in this context eaops could be optimized by ranging different key operational parameters that would allow the determination of the best ratio between ros and cas production especially for marine water disinfection purposes 3 5 preliminary estimation of operation costs once disinfection efficiency was evaluated and different scenarios were exposed the energy efficiency of the process was estimated it was performed by considering only electricity consumption cano et al 2016 ghasemian et al 2017 thus the specific energy consumption w can be calculated from the values of the electrical charge applied q and the total applied voltage v eq 7 cano et al 2016 7 w k w h m 3 q v this was calculated for the s1 s4 samples as is shown in table 3 according to different scenarios a variance trough 0 009 0 264 kwh m 3 can be seen depending on the degree of inactivation reached for high inactivation degrees 4 log red s3 s4 higher energy consumption is required 0 095 0 264 kwh m 3 for low medium degrees of inactivation less consumption was estimated 0 009 0 035 kwh m 3 for samples s1 and s2 respectively these values are slightly higher than those obtained by e g lacasa et al 2013 or nanayakkara et al 2012 who required 0 009 0 088 kwh m 3 for complete inactivation of e coli in ballast water for more resistant organisms such as a franciscana consumption increases up to 8 6 kwh m 3 lacasa et al 2013 thus the values obtained suggest that the mhb could be more resistant than the typical indicator established on the bwmc such as e coli the primary techniques used for ballast water treatment are uv radiation and electrochemical processes lloyd s register maritime 2017 stehouwer et al 2015 in which calculated values for energy consumption represent promising results when compared to those obtained when uv systems are applied for example moreno andrés et al 2016 estimated that 0 047 kwh m 3 was used to reach 4 log reductions in e faecalis which can be reduced to 0 026 kwh m 3 if an aop is applied uv h2o2 with the data obtained in the present study 0 095 kwh m 3 are required for a 3 7 log reduction of mhb with 0 009 kwh m 3 s1 less efficiency can be obtained in the first stage 2 2 log reduction however by keeping the tro in a second stage total inactivation can be achieved in 3 day as has been explained in section 3 2 fig 3a 4 conclusions in this study the suitability of an advanced electrochemical oxidation process eaop with boron doped diamond bdd electrodes for disinfection of seawater was assessed at a laboratory scale several aspects have been addressed by covering the entire disinfection process inactivation kinetics and recolonization after treatment with a bacterial diversity assessment together with an estimation of energy costs by assessing inactivation kinetics a biphasic inactivation approach exhibits a good fit for marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb by obtaining disinfection parameters such as the electrical charge applied q that is needed for reaching a 4 log reduction 0 019 ah l 1 or a 3 log reduction 0 007 ah l 1 by comparison with chlorination it can be concluded that the use of bdd anodes induces greater cell damage when an aeop is applied those cell damages are sufficient for preventing bacterial regrowth when tro is kept in a solution furthermore bacterial community dynamics after treatment was evaluated it was concluded that despite disinfection processes can be effective there is not only a capacity for regrowth after treatment but also a bacterial succession process in which different bacterial groups may be dominant this aspect has direct implications on ballast water management depending on the ecosystem status of receiving waters it may enhance the potential introduction of aquatic invasive microbes that could lead to serious ecological economic and health consequences finally the energy costs of the process were estimated suggesting that the eaop is an environmentally friendly technology with low energy consumption in accordance with treatment strategy it is an essential factor for onboard bwts along with the capacity of production in situ oxidant species operation in mild conditions and the smaller footprint compact reactors additionally the feasibility to work in high flow rates as shown in this study makes these processes a valid strategy for ballast water management

19550,seawater treatment is increasingly required due to industrial activities that use substantial volumes of seawater in their processes the shipping industry and the associated management of a ship s ballast water are currently considered a global challenge for the seas related to that the suitability of an electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop with boron doped diamond bdd electrodes has been assessed on a laboratory scale for the disinfection of seawater this technology can produce both reactive oxygen species and chlorine species especially in seawater that are responsible for inactivation the eaop was applied in a continuous flow regime with real seawater natural marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb were used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency a biphasic inactivation kinetic model was fitted on experimental points achieving 4 log reductions at 0 019 ah l 1 by assessing regrowth after treatment results suggest that higher bacterial damages result from the eaop when it is compared to chlorination furthermore several issues lacking fundamental understanding were investigated such as recolonization capacity or bacterial community dynamics it was concluded that despite disinfection processes being effective there is not only a possibility for regrowth after treatment but also a change on bacterial population diversity produced by the treatment finally energy consumption was estimated and indicated that 0 264 kwh m 3 are needed for 4 8 log reductions of mhb otherwise with 0 035 kwh m 3 less disinfection efficiency can be obtained 2 2 log red however with a residual oxidant in the solution total inactivation can be achieved in three days graphical abstract image 1 keywords ballast water treatment marine bacteria chlorine active species ros recolonization bacterial diversity 1 introduction the treatment of seawater has experienced increased interest related to industrial activities that utilize substantial volumes of seawater in processes such as aquaculture or shipping it implies associated risks due to the control of pathogens or undesired biofouling that must be prevented de schryver and vadstein 2014 oh et al 2010 tanaka et al 2013 maritime transport deserves special attention in 2015 world seaborne trade volumes were estimated to have exceeded ten billion tons which means that 80 of international trade is conducted by sea unctad 2016 related to that an emerging challenge associated with a ship s ballast water has been related to the introduction of aquatic invasive species currently it is considered as the fourth greatest threat to the world s oceans gef undp imo 2017 unctad 2016 thus the international convention on the management of ships ballast water and sediments bwmc was adopted in 2004 and has recently been entered into force september 2017 imo 2004 among several specific aspects the bwmc requires that ballast water must be treated in accordance with discharge limits established in rule d2 it distinguished five organism groups with three being indicator microbes e coli enterococci and v cholerae these microbiological standards are proposed in order to avoid the introduction of undesired aquatic microorganisms bacterial indicators are otherwise primarily centered on human health concerns and do not consider the risks associated with other coastal activities it specifically implies to additional aquatic bacteria or viruses which could cause epidemics epizootics or other ecosystem consequences besides some authors indicate that specific indicator microbes standards that are established in the bwmc were identified at low concentrations in ballast water samples cohen and dobbs 2015 lymperopoulou and dobbs 2017 in parallel other studies showed the high diversity of marine bacteria in ballast tanks brinkmeyer 2016 lymperopoulou and dobbs 2017 which suggests that other bacterial indicators such as marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb should be incorporated into the regulations nevertheless the entry into force of the bwmc requires the implementation of seawater disinfection systems in this aspect several studies have been conducted to propose a number of options for treating ballast water that take into account environmental technical and economic criteria lloyd s register maritime 2017 tsolaki and diamadopoulos 2010 a number of challenges in this regard are the ability of working with high ballasting and discharge flow rates as well as ensuring their effectiveness in seawater that is characterized by high salinity and high microbiological activity on the other hand even though a wide range of studies focused on treatment efficiency there is limited literature focusing on side effects caused by disinfection it implies the regrowth potential in ballast tanks grob and pollet 2016 or the hazards associated with the alteration on dynamics of bacterial communities after disinfection which seems to be an emerging challenge hess erga et al 2010 chemical disinfection such as chlorination or using several biocides is problematic if it needs to be used onboard due to the transport and storage of active substances besides depending on the water matrix composition the generation of hazardous by products could be an issue of major concern werschkun et al 2012 uv disinfection is another well established method for this purpose however it has a disadvantage which is the repair mechanisms of microorganisms and consequential regrowth especially in these types of waters grob and pollet 2016 moreno andrés et al 2018 romero martínez et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as an alternative option for water treatment they have mainly been focused on the disinfection of drinking water and the removal of hardly biodegradable organic pollutants in wastewaters chaplin 2014 comninellis and chen 2010 however aops in seawater have been poorly developed for these purposes aguilar et al 2017 moreno andrés et al 2017 rubio et al 2013 särkkä et al 2015 an attractive alternative is the in situ generation of oxidant species as in the case of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops they have gained significance through the years by providing high efficiency in drinking water and in both industrial and domestic wastewater treatment systems chaplin 2014 garcia segura et al 2017 moreira et al 2017 särkkä et al 2015 even in ballast water or aquaculture applications high inactivation rates have been reached e g with low energy requirements for e coli nanayakkara et al 2012 as well as in different types of marine organisms cha et al 2015 oh et al 2010 tanaka et al 2013 tsolaki et al 2010 however these studies used active electrodes with low oxygen evolution overpotential this only permits the application of low currents before oxygen evolution begins and consequently competitive reactions occur that result in the major consumption of radical species and thus lower efficiency comninellis and chen 2010 jeong et al 2009 additionally active electrodes also favor the direct oxidation of chloride ions at the electrode surface to form chlorine garcia segura et al 2017 jeong et al 2006 panizza and cerisola 2009 with the aim to assess powerful oxidizing treatments that could achieve high disinfection efficiency together with the avoidance of bacterial regrowth the use of non active electrodes can be a valid candidate for seawater treatment vacca et al 2013 with non active electrodes higher efficiencies in the electro generation of reactive oxygen species ros can be achieved due to the high overpotential for oxygen evolution eqs 1 4 garcia segura et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 vacca et al 2013 thus a combination of ros oxidation and active chlorine generation could take part in disinfection mechanisms jeong et al 2006 therefore among the major advantages of the non active materials such as the high mechanical strength and chemical inertness oh are physisorbed on the anode surface and higher inactivation rates may be reached i e non active anode promotes oh diffusion to the bulk and reduces competing reactions comninellis and chen 2010 jeong et al 2009 moreira et al 2017 1 h2o oh h e 2 oh o h e 3 o o2 o3 4 oh oh h2o2 a clear example is the use of boron doped diamond bdd as anode material chaplin 2014 it has previously been studied for disinfection of seawater e g lacasa et al 2013 evaluated disinfection efficiency on artemia salina and e coli petrucci et al 2013 obtained strong inactivation effects for marine dinoflagellates and marine bacterium p aeruginosa however those studies work either at batch mode implies an electrolysis time in the order of minutes or at very low flow rates an aspect that is not feasible in the case of ballast water treatments bwts that require high ballasting deballasting flow rates in this context the eaop with bdd electrodes was evaluated and their operation was optimized for disinfection of seawater by assessing both inactivation kinetics and regrowth capability following treatment the application of this process in a continuous flow regime with real seawater and natural marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb as an indicator of disinfection efficiency is the main novelty aspect furthermore an approach of bacterial community dynamics after treatment has been performed this is a factor that is extremely challenging in the case of ballast water discharges finally a comparison of the disinfection efficiency between the eaop and naocl added as a chemical has been performed to investigate the bacterial survival on both processes 2 material and methods 2 1 water sampling seawater sw samples were collected from trondheimfjord trondheim norway sw was pumped from 70 m deep at sealab ntnu centre of fisheries and aquaculture and following the sand filter step they were collected in 25 l tanks and used as a water matrix for experimental assays physicochemical characterization of the water used in the experiments was performed table 1 including conductivity ph temperature hq430d hach and turbidity 2100an hach laboratory turbidimeter a total organic carbon toc analysis was conducted using an apollo 9000 toc analyzer alkalinity was determined by a titration using hydrochloric acid hcl 0 02m avs titrinorm vrw different ions were analyzed by ion chromatography 881 compact ic pro 882 compact ic plus metrohm with detection by conductivity 2 2 electrolytic cell and experimental set up experiments were performed in a diaclean lab unit waterdiam with electrolytic cell diaclean 106 101 which consists of two monopolar circular si bdd electrodes boron doped diamond on silicon substrate their active surface is 70 cm2 with an electrode gap of 1 mm the electrical power was supplied by a dc power supply diaclean ps 1000 polarity reversal function with tunable frequencies the range of possible applied current was between 0 6 up to 19 a 2 2 1 inactivation assays experiments were conducted in a single pass with seawater pumped in once from the storage tank 20 l through the electrolytic cell at different flow rates 200 1000 l h 1 and various current values 0 7 7 3a which corresponds to current density ranging between 9 72 and 101 38 ma cm 2 and implying different electrical charges applied q fig a1 supp material theoretical retention time trt on electrolytic cell ranged from 0 13 to 0 03 s before each battery of assays the lab unit was cleaned and disinfected with sodium hypochlorite and then rinsed with sterile water during this cleaning procedure polarity was automatically inverted every 10 min to avoid operational problems such as the formation of coatings or any material on the electrode surfaces from previous runs each sample was collected in a sterile 250 ml flask at the outlet once the flow rate was stabilized first a similar volume to the total system volume was wasted and the sample was subsequently collected in an ascending flow rate to avoid possible microbiological contamination at the beginning of the assay a control sample was taken to determine the initial bacterial concentration additionally a mechanical stress control was done by performing a run at 0 ma cm 2 no changes with the control were detected samples in the same experimental series were taken during a time lapse of 20 min maximum and stored in a cool dark place until microbiological analysis each sample different flow rate current was collected in two sterile flasks one was collected with a quenching agent in order to determine survival bacterial and assure that the electro generated total residual oxidants tro did not have bactericidal effects after treatment the other was collected by keeping the tro in a solution with the aim of assessing the residual effects after treatment 2 2 2 recolonization assays survival and recolonization of marine heterotrophic bacteria were investigated after the disinfection procedures by replicating a system of ballast water treatment in which water was stored in ballast tanks during a voyage in this context five samples were selected in varying degrees of inactivation produced by different values of the tro that was generated unt s1 s2 s3 s4 with unt being the untreated sample initial control the experimental procedure was similar to the previous section collecting samples in 250 ml flasks previously sterilized by autoclave collecting them twice quenching the tro and keeping it in a solution the five samples unt s1 s2 s3 s4 were stored in the dark at 20 c each day the bacterial concentration and tro were measured according to sections 2 3 and 2 4 respectively each battery of assays was repeated in three independent moments statistical differences between each sample with controls were evaluated by analysis of variance anova using statgraphics centurion xvii version 17 0 16 statpoints technologies inc 2 3 microbiological procedures natural marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb was assessed as an indicator of disinfection efficiency following imo recommendations bwmc g8 guideline a minimum concentration of 104 colony forming unit cfu per ml is needed for inactivation assays to obtain that concentration and secure good statistics yeast extract was added as a substrate for mhb four equal amounts were added at 0 3 6 and 12 h total of 2 μg ml 1 all assays began 48 h after water sampling bacterial survival after treatment was assessed by colony counting samples were plated in triplicate on petri dishes with difco marine agar 2216 detection limit 2 cfu ml 1 petri plates were inverted and incubated at 20 c for five days to assure valid counts on petri plates ten fold dilutions were performed and the majority of agar plates used for quantification had 10 150 cfu with three replicates per sample we obtained a coefficient variation of 30 after yeast extract additions the initial concentration of mhb was approximately 106 cfu ml 1 which gives a disinfection detection limit of 5 70 decimal log units log n n0 sterile conditions were monitored with plating blank samples during the microbiological analytical procedure 2 3 1 estimates of bacterial diversity a plate count method based on the time required to form macroscopically visible colonies tv days was used tv is linearly related to the maximum specific growth rate therefore divides the culturable mhb into categories based on their maximum growth rate this is a simple methodology that requires no specialized equipment and is applicable for describing the community structure with special reference to r k theory salvesen and vadstein 2000 the procedure followed the protocol of salvesen and vadstein 2000 briefly samples from three independent experiments were spread in triplicate on agar and incubated at 20 c each day during a period of eight days an untreated sample was used as a model of natural seawater i e freshly collected water samples cfus were counted regularly after plating to obtain differences in the frequency distribution of visible colonies as a function of time after plating colonies had to have a diameter 0 2 mm to be considered visible thus colonies that belonged to bacterial groups with high growth rates would be visible on the first or second day after plating whereas those with slower growth rates would take longer to develop visible colonies in this aspect with the aim of obtaining a parameter with biological interpretation the percentage of rapidly grown colonies was obtained i e colonies that showed tv 1 and 2 in respect to the total this is directly related to the theory of r and k strategists because opportunistic bacteria r strategists are distinct from non opportunistic k strategists according to their high maximum growth rate de schryver and vadstein 2014 salvesen and vadstein 2000 2 3 2 microbiological data analysis modeling of inactivation kinetics was performed according to different types of microbial survival models geeraerd et al 2005 the most suitable for this case was the biphasic model according to eq 5 cerf 1977 5 n n 0 f e k 1 q 1 f e k 2 q parameters in the model are electrical charge applied q ah l 1 first and second disinfection rate constants k1 k2 l ah 1 and the fraction of the initial organisms that follows a fast disinfection route f associated to k1 the validity of this model was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse for regrowth analysis the percentage of bacterial regrowth was calculated according to eq 6 based on the concentration of viable bacteria cfu ml 1 before n0 and after n disinfection treatment as well as in the regrowth sample nt lindenauer and darby 1994 6 r e p a i r n t n n 0 n 100 2 4 chemicals and analytical methods in addition to the eaop application parallel assays were performed with sodium hypochlorite naclo solution 10 w v sigma aldrich added as a chemical in order to compare the effects of electro generated tro in bacterial inactivation sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate na2s2o3 5h2o sigma aldrich was used for tro quenching at a ratio of 3 mol of na2s2o3 5h2o for every mol of chlorine in the samples it was placed in sterile flasks before sampling in order to achieve instant tro neutralization the colorimetric dpd method was used as an analytical method for the determination of oxidant species it is accepted for water analysis by standard protocols epa method 330 5 standard method 4500 cl g in both wastewater and drinking water as well as being recommended for seawater cha et al 2015 this method is based on the oxidation of n n diethyl p phenylendiamin dpd in the presence of oxidants the color intensity was measured with a hach dr 2000 spectrophotometer it should be noted that in addition to chlorine other possible oxidants can be electro generated and also react with dpd ghasemian et al 2017 therefore results are represented as tro and expressed as mg cl2 l 1 temperature ph and conductivity were measured throughout the experimental samples and variations with respect to the control untreated samples were not detected 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetic assays a battery of assays was performed in order to define inactivation kinetics of the mhb after the eaop the dose response curve is depicted in fig 1 in which the decimal logarithm of bacterial reduction log n n0 versus the electrical charge applied q is represented the experimental points exhibit a good fit r2 0 947 rmse 0 392 for the biphasic inactivation model eq 5 cerf 1977 geeraerd et al 2005 through a non linear adjustment of the experimental points kinetic rate constants were obtained k1 and k2 l ah 1 this indicates two different phases of disinfection primary inactivation with a first order rate constant k1 followed by a tailing deviation with k2 the f parameter is associated with k1 and determines the population rate that is inactivated in the first phase i e f 99 96 s e 0 0004 of the entire population are inactivated with k1 1082 32 l ah 1 s e 75 62 the remaining 0 04 is inactivated with a k2 that is near to zero 96 33 l ah 1 s e 84 69 additionally a number of calculations of interest can be made by obtaining the q necessary to reach a 4 log reduction 0 019 ah l 1 or a 3 log reduction 0 007 ah l 1 which permits an easy comparison of disinfection efficacy when different kinetic models are applied moreno andrés et al 2017 the same levels of inactivation were achieved for other authors e g 0 01 0 02 ah l 1 are needed for total inactivation of e coli cano et al 2012 lacasa et al 2013 other authors such as anfruns estrada et al 2017 work in different operation regimes and reach at least a 4 log reduction of diverse types of bacteria at current densities of 33 3 ma cm 2 and between 20 and 90 min residence time in this study higher inactivation rates were obtained with current density values of 95 ma cm 2 but with a residence time of 0 13 s in the maximum case inactivation pathways on the eaops are derived from two different disinfection mechanisms known as direct at electrode surface or indirect inactivation fig a1 supp material moreira et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 särkkä et al 2015 the latter is the result of oxidants species produced either by water oxidation or by substances that are dissolved in water which in our case is the use of seawater with high concentrations of chloride ions however other species such as sulfate or hydrogencarbonate can electro generate additional oxidant species such as peroxydisulfate or peroxodicarbonate which can be involved in disinfection processes garcia segura et al 2017 the oxidation of chlorides on an anode surface leads to the formation of free chlorine which is consequently hydrolyzed to form hypochlorous acid hclo hypochlorite ion clo depending on the ph of the solution in that context the chlorine active species cas that were generated were represented according to the electrical charge applied q fig 2 according to fig 2 a linear trend is observed at least by the q values that cover the entire inactivation kinetics afterwards a quadratic expression applies suggesting that the generation of oxidizing species will reach a limit fig 2 outerbox in this aspect oxygen evolution will be the dominant process instead of the electro generation of oxidant species ghasemian et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2009 according to that a direct relationship between the tro generation and disinfection efficiency can be assumed on inactivation kinetics nevertheless this aspect will be discussed later in section 3 4 on the other hand the use of bdd electrodes as non active anode material has a main disadvantage which is the production of noxious ionic species chlorate perchlorates bromates as a result of further oxidation of both cas and bromide compounds bergmann et al 2009 oh et al 2010 vacca et al 2013 in this context vacca et al 2013 studied the behavior of both of these compounds with the eaop on the bdd electrodes and concluded that when cl and br are both present in a solution disinfection by products dbps will depend primarily on the chloride concentration because the generation of active chlorine is the quickest reaction thus when the chloride concentration is in the amounts of seawater in the order of 10 g l 1 bromate production is almost completely inhibited during the electrolysis process vacca et al 2013 additionally this speciation is significantly affected by both applied current density and flow rate i e low current densities with high flow rates can reduce the formation of hazardous dbps bergmann et al 2009 cano et al 2012 according to the results obtained our current density work range was 9 72 101 38 ma cm 2 with flow rates ranging from 200 to 1000 l h 1 according to bergmann et al 2009 a small influence on perchlorate concentration is detected with flow rates 200 l h 1 otherwise cano et al 2012 did not detect hazardous by products even at a trace level with current density values of 0 13 1 3 ma cm 2 which are quite low values compared to this study hence high inactivation rates have been reached with both higher current densities as well as higher flow rates in terms of q operational values similar to those of cano et al 2012 were achieved nevertheless one of the most significant challenges for the eaops is the up scaling from lab scale to full scale therefore future studies are recommended to carefully investigate dbps under real operating conditions such as high flow rates 3 2 recolonization after treatment it is known that bacteria can regrow even after an apparent successful disinfection treatment grob and pollet 2016 in order to study this regrowth capability four samples were selected in different degrees of inactivation and thus differently generated tro s1 s2 s3 s4 all details appear in table 2 different strategies could be utilized after chemical disinfection in this study two approaches were taken i quenching the tro or ii keeping it in solution in fig 3 it can be observed how the mhb can evolve after treatment under these two strategies when the tro was neutralized after treatment the data reflects that bacteria can recover within two days regardless of the disinfection degree that was reached fig 3a significant differences between each treatment with controls were detected on s2 s4 samples on day 0 p 0 05 otherwise no statistical differences were found between the treated samples compared with the control 48 h after treatment i e treated samples were statistically equal to the control from day 2 onwards in this case recolonization occurred within two days fig 3a which is what happens with other types of treatments hess erga et al 2010 romero martínez et al 2016 this scenario take place with a majority of chemical options for bwts that are used to treat waters at the uptake or at the discharge with the consequential neutralization of the residual oxidant before it enters into ballast tanks this is to avoid active substances than can cause either toxic effects or corrosion in tanks lloyd s register maritime 2017 on the other hand no regrowth is observed if the tro is kept in solution regardless of the oxidant concentration fig 3b in this case statistical differences p 0 05 were obtained in all of the treated samples when compared with the control from day 1 until the end of the experiment here the diffusion of tro into the cells may act as an extra factor of inactivation after treatment the high level of cellular aggressions caused by ros may facilitate the diffusion of the disinfectant into the cell in a post treatment scenario according to the results that were obtained it seems to be sufficient for growth inhibition following the strategy in which the tro is kept in a solution in order to prevent regrowth monitoring the tro decay is required this ensures that the oxidant concentration does not exceed the maximal discharge limit concentration e g 0 5 mg l 1 according to mepc 159 55 for the discharge of treated effluents by onboard wastewater treatment systems no tro discharge standard currently exists for ballast water in this sense the tro concentration was monitored over 16 days by simulating a ballast tank results are depicted in fig 4 in the case of samples with high generated tro s3 s4 10 30 mg l 1 complete removal was not detected within 16 days samples with 1 and 5 mg l 1 s1 s2 did not show detectable levels of tro at the end of the test i e the tro was completely removed on the second day s1 while in s2 complete removal was reached on the fourth day it is an advantage when treatment is performed at the ballast water uptake whereby treated water can maintain low concentrations of tro and total inactivation can be achieved during the ship s voyage fig 3b and fig 4 additionally at the moment of discharge the levels of the tro will be below discharge limits this strategy is in accordance with echardt and kornmueller 2009 3 3 effects on bacterial community composition apart from the importance of regrowth in ballast ships tanks the changes in the bacterial community evolution is a strategic factor that must be monitored the effects caused by disinfection treatments can result in increased levels of dissolved organic carbon that facilitates recolonization of surviving bacteria in receiving waters as can be seen in section 3 2 besides recolonization bacterial succession dynamics are important in the way that the absence of competition low bacterial concentrations after disinfection allows easy growth for bacteria with high specific growth rates usually known as opportunists or r strategists according to that an approach of the bacterial community succession has been performed based on the time required to form macroscopically visible colonies tv as is explained in section 2 3 1 thus lower tv values are associated with bacterial groups exhibiting higher specific growth rates and could be related to opportunistic bacteria these are often the opportunistic pathogens meanwhile higher tv values are associated with k strategists which could be representative of an ecosystem with a stable environment where high interspecific competition select slow growing specialists salvesen and vadstein 2000 this theory has direct consequences on microbial ecology and ballast water implications de schryver and vadstein 2014 hess erga et al 2010 litchman 2010 selected cases for samples taken on days 1 2 4 and 8 after treatment are represented in fig 5 the percentage of bacteria that was visible on days 1 and 2 i e tv 1 and 2 in respect to the total bacterial community can be observed they are associated with r strategists with higher growth rates thus are so called fast growers the specific data and tv values appear in table a 1 supp data it is important to emphasize that the data represent the case when the tro was quenched after treatment on the contrary no regrowth was detected section 3 2 according to fig 5 it can be determined that the percentage of fast growers is higher in treated samples than in those that are untreated assuming that bacterial groups with higher growth rates prevail in treated samples for example on the first two days after treatment more than 50 of the colonies in all of the treated samples are considered r strategists in untreated samples a steady distribution is observed i e the percentage of fast growers does not exceed 35 on the first two days of incubation after a succession process days 4 8 those differences seem to diminish for instance s1 and s2 decrease considerably in the percentage of fast growers otherwise for samples s3 and s4 in which a higher electrical dose q was applied the colonies of rapid growth are still above 50 that means that variations in bacterial communities after storage can occur and it seems to be related to treatment strength this transitory shift in bacterial communities can be due to several factors these factors include the greater availability of nutrients for surviving bacteria the increase of biodegradable fraction due to the modification of organic matter after treatment that consequently rises on substrate availability or a possible increase in resistance mechanisms after oxidative damages for specific bacterial groups becerra castro et al 2016 hess erga et al 2010 moreno andrés et al 2018 thus despite the fact that disinfection processes can be effective a bacterial succession process can occur and consequently different bacterial groups may be dominant according to the data obtained it suggests that a monopolization of rapidly growing bacteria dominates the system treated samples at least during the first days although it is a poorly explored issue some studies accord with this trend in both wastewater becerra castro et al 2016 and seawater hess erga et al 2010 it is probable that the increase in opportunistic bacteria associated with high growth rates could dominate a disturbed environment such as a post disinfection scenario in the event of ballast tanks or receiving harbor areas this may also enhance the invasive potential of aquatic invasive microbes which could lead to serious ecological economic and health consequences drillet 2016 litchman 2010 especially because many genus of pathogens are usually detected in dominated r selected communities vadstein et al in prep this aspect is very important in ballast water implications because all of these scenarios can interfere with different ballast water management strategies in this sense in depth studies are recommended to specifically evaluate possible changes in bacterial diversity after disinfection of ballast water 3 4 bacterial survival concerning to the treatment aeop and chlorination finally all of the results discussed in the previous sections are directly related to inactivation mechanisms that are associated with the disinfection processes in this aspect electrochemical processes in seawater are primarily applied for the generation of cas särkkä et al 2015 stehouwer et al 2015 tanaka et al 2013 additionally it has been demonstrated that ros generated in electrochemical disinfection implies higher disinfection efficiency jeong et al 2006 with the aim of assessing a specific cas role on bacterial inactivation it was independently evaluated by adding naocl in order to achieve the same concentrations of tro as those assessed in samples s1 s4 naocl was added in a single dosage and the evolution of the mhb was evaluated in the different microcosm experiments such as those in section 3 2 i e by keeping the tro in a solution only slight differences of instantaneous inactivation were obtained compared to the eaop data not shown however on the contrary the evolution after treatment differs significantly consequently the percentage of regrowth after treatment was calculated according to eq 6 and is represented in fig 6 according to fig 6 the regrowth of the mhb occurs according to different levels of added chlorine i e s1 1 mg l 1 reaches the higher values of bacterial regrowth followed by s2 and s3 5 10 mg l 1 and negative values were obtained in s4 it must be remembered that according to section 3 2 the regrowth percentage remained negative for all of the samples when electro generated tro is kept in a solution fig 3b thus greater cellular damage occurs on the eaop compared to naocl suggesting that different oxidant species besides cas are involved in disinfection mechanisms and prevent the regrowth after treatment as stated in section 3 1 the inactivation of microorganisms in an electrolytic cell follows both direct and indirect oxidation processes direct inactivation requires bacterial adherence on the anode surface in this regard ghasemian et al 2017 studied the role of bacterial adhesion on electrodes surfaces and no high inactivation rates were detected whereas it mainly depended on the type of bacteria in addition two main indirect oxidation mechanisms are derived from either water quality which is mainly influenced by chloride concentration or water oxidation the electro oxidation of water generates different ros eqs 1 4 which can play an important role in disinfection mechanisms in this sense several studies considered a variety electrode materials jeong et al 2009 selective hydroxyl radical probe compounds jing and chaplin 2017 or electrolyte systems muff et al 2011 to determine the specific production of oh in the eaops all confirmed the high production of oh when non active electrodes bdd were used jeong et al 2009 specifically state that oh production by the bdd electrodes was approximately ten times higher compared to active electrodes additionally it can be assumed that chemical disinfection efficiency depends on the type of disinfectant while cas does not cause cell surface damage i e disinfection mechanisms are based on inner cell components cho et al 2010 oh are able to inactivate cells by mainly causing membrane or wall damages resulting in major cell injury fiorentino et al 2015 thus the higher bacterial damage that avoids regrowth detected in this study in comparison with naocl could be attributed to the electro generation of several ros such as oh h2o2 and o3 jeong et al 2009 2006 the use of seawater as an efficient electrolyte not only implies the generation of chlorine active species cas but can also generate reactive oxygen species ros which probably are responsible for the inhibition of bacterial regrowth thus future studies are recommended with the aim to define the specific role of both ros specially oh and cas on the inactivation mechanisms in this context eaops could be optimized by ranging different key operational parameters that would allow the determination of the best ratio between ros and cas production especially for marine water disinfection purposes 3 5 preliminary estimation of operation costs once disinfection efficiency was evaluated and different scenarios were exposed the energy efficiency of the process was estimated it was performed by considering only electricity consumption cano et al 2016 ghasemian et al 2017 thus the specific energy consumption w can be calculated from the values of the electrical charge applied q and the total applied voltage v eq 7 cano et al 2016 7 w k w h m 3 q v this was calculated for the s1 s4 samples as is shown in table 3 according to different scenarios a variance trough 0 009 0 264 kwh m 3 can be seen depending on the degree of inactivation reached for high inactivation degrees 4 log red s3 s4 higher energy consumption is required 0 095 0 264 kwh m 3 for low medium degrees of inactivation less consumption was estimated 0 009 0 035 kwh m 3 for samples s1 and s2 respectively these values are slightly higher than those obtained by e g lacasa et al 2013 or nanayakkara et al 2012 who required 0 009 0 088 kwh m 3 for complete inactivation of e coli in ballast water for more resistant organisms such as a franciscana consumption increases up to 8 6 kwh m 3 lacasa et al 2013 thus the values obtained suggest that the mhb could be more resistant than the typical indicator established on the bwmc such as e coli the primary techniques used for ballast water treatment are uv radiation and electrochemical processes lloyd s register maritime 2017 stehouwer et al 2015 in which calculated values for energy consumption represent promising results when compared to those obtained when uv systems are applied for example moreno andrés et al 2016 estimated that 0 047 kwh m 3 was used to reach 4 log reductions in e faecalis which can be reduced to 0 026 kwh m 3 if an aop is applied uv h2o2 with the data obtained in the present study 0 095 kwh m 3 are required for a 3 7 log reduction of mhb with 0 009 kwh m 3 s1 less efficiency can be obtained in the first stage 2 2 log reduction however by keeping the tro in a second stage total inactivation can be achieved in 3 day as has been explained in section 3 2 fig 3a 4 conclusions in this study the suitability of an advanced electrochemical oxidation process eaop with boron doped diamond bdd electrodes for disinfection of seawater was assessed at a laboratory scale several aspects have been addressed by covering the entire disinfection process inactivation kinetics and recolonization after treatment with a bacterial diversity assessment together with an estimation of energy costs by assessing inactivation kinetics a biphasic inactivation approach exhibits a good fit for marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb by obtaining disinfection parameters such as the electrical charge applied q that is needed for reaching a 4 log reduction 0 019 ah l 1 or a 3 log reduction 0 007 ah l 1 by comparison with chlorination it can be concluded that the use of bdd anodes induces greater cell damage when an aeop is applied those cell damages are sufficient for preventing bacterial regrowth when tro is kept in a solution furthermore bacterial community dynamics after treatment was evaluated it was concluded that despite disinfection processes can be effective there is not only a capacity for regrowth after treatment but also a bacterial succession process in which different bacterial groups may be dominant this aspect has direct implications on ballast water management depending on the ecosystem status of receiving waters it may enhance the potential introduction of aquatic invasive microbes that could lead to serious ecological economic and health consequences finally the energy costs of the process were estimated suggesting that the eaop is an environmentally friendly technology with low energy consumption in accordance with treatment strategy it is an essential factor for onboard bwts along with the capacity of production in situ oxidant species operation in mild conditions and the smaller footprint compact reactors additionally the feasibility to work in high flow rates as shown in this study makes these processes a valid strategy for ballast water management

and thorsten hüffer are equal first authors tire wear particles twp generated from tire material during use on roads have gained increasing attention as part of organic particulate contaminants such as microplastic in aquatic environments the available information on properties and generation of twp analytical techniques to determine twp emissions occurrence and behavior and ecotoxicological effects of twp are reviewed with a focus on surface water as a potential receptor twp emissions are traffic related and contribute 5 30 to non exhaust emissions from traffic the mass of twp generated is estimated at 1 327 000 t a for the european union 1 120 000 t a for the united states and 133 000 t a for germany for germany this is equivalent to four times the amount of pesticides used the mass of twp ultimately entering the aquatic environment strongly depends on the extent of collection and treatment of road runoff which is highly variable for the german highways it is estimated that up to 11 000 t a of twp reach surface waters data on twp concentrations in the environment including surface waters are fragmentary which is also due to the lack of suitable analytical methods for their determination information on twp properties such as density and size distribution are missing this hampers assessing the fate of twp in the aquatic environment effects in the aquatic environment may stem from twp itself or from compounds released from twp it is concluded that reliable knowledge on transport mechanism to surface waters concentrations in surface waters and sediments effects of aging environmental half lives of twp as well as effects on aquatic organisms are missing these aspects need to be addressed to allow for the assessment of risk of twp in an aquatic environment

of plastic debris and microplastics in the aquatic environment has raised the awareness that organic contaminants reach the aquatic environment not only in dissolved but also in particulate form it has been recognized that both the plastic particle as a physical entity and the plastic particle constituents as chemicals may cause adverse effects to the ecosystems research on microplastic has only focused on thermoplastic material like polyethylene or polystyrene and did not consider elastomers such as rubber according to iso rubber is not covered by the definition for plastic iso 2013 while others suggest to use a more general definition for microplastic that covers all man made macromolecular materials and would thus include rubber verschoor 2015 one of the most relevant sources for rubber emissions is automobile traffic kole et al 2017 while total traffic related non exhaust particulate emissions have been estimated and recognized as potential environmental contaminants less data is available specifically on tire wear particles twp which are formed from tires undergoing friction on the road this is astonishing as twp were suggested as a major contributor of metals e g zn released into the environment councell et al 2004 goonetilleke et al 2017 twp emissions split up into airborne and non airborne emissions non airborne emissions make up 90 99 9 of the total twp emissions and can be found deposited on the road or at the road side panko et al 2013a while the fate and effects of airborne twp have been investigated intensively amato et al 2014 grigoratos and martini 2015 thorpe and harrison 2008 van der gon et al 2013 the non airborne twp are far less studied it is expected that surface runoff transports twp from the road or road side towards wastewater treatment plants or the receiving water body huber et al 2016 this may lead to pollution of surface waters and the pedosphere data on twp pollution of surface waters as well as on their concentration and fate in surface waters are rare it is known that particle properties and local conditions such as rain intensity and infrastructure control twp accumulation and transport goonetilleke et al 2017 for instance in highway runoff total suspended solid concentration is efficiently reduced by more than 80 in sedimentation ponds vollertsen et al 2007 or wetlands gill et al 2017 in many cases surface runoff from rural roads is not collected and twp may accumulate at the road side and distribute further kole et al 2017 however quantitative data on twp accumulation and distribution are not available environmental concentrations of twp have been assessed based on twp marker concentrations kumata et al 1996 pant and harrison 2013 wik and dave 2009 twp markers are tire constituents which occur in specific concentrations in tire material this approach is limited due to multiple sources of most available marker substances and variations of the marker content in the tires therefore source apportionment of non exhaust emission has been largely hampered thorpe and harrison 2008 by the lack of reliable data due to missing analytical methods typically twp are composed of rubber filling agents oils vulcanization agents and further additives kreider et al 2010 due to interactions with other particulate matter twp are subjected to changes in morphology and composition which makes it difficult to track and quantify them in the environment twp are often examined in conjunction with the pavement material as it is not easy to distinguish between these two sources amato et al 2014 boulter et al 2006 harrison et al 2012 kreider et al 2010 therefore this review uses the term twp for all particles originating from tire abrasion this review assesses information and data on properties and generation of twp analytical techniques to determine twp emission occurrence and behavior and ecotoxicological effects focusing on the surface waters as potential receptor we thereby aim i to address the relevance of twp for the aquatic environment and ii to identify data and information gaps which have to be closed in order to be able to conclude on risks related to the occurrence of twp in surface waters 2 characteristics of tire wear particles and their emission into the environment 2 1 tire materials tire materials are complex mixtures as various chemicals are used during the production of tires besides the rubber itself fillers reinforcement agents processing aids accelerators and retarders adhesives and activators may be added table 1 despite consistent usage of the general ingredients the composition of a specific tire depends on its application for example a common sized all season passenger commercial tire contains approximately 30 types of synthetic and 8 natural rubbers 8 kinds of carbon black steel cord for belts polyester and nylon fiber steel bead wire and 40 different chemicals waxes oils pigments silica and clays baumann and ismeier 1998 natural rubber nr is a linear polymer of isoprene 2 methyl butadiene due to its high structural regularity natural rubber tends to crystallize spontaneously at low temperatures or when it is stretched the polymer network of nr allows the elasticity and flexibility to be combined with crystallization induced strength and toughness through the vulcanization of raw nr with sulfur or hardening with carbon black as filler baumann and ismeier 1998 given the superior performance in terms of tear strength and heat resistance nr is the preferred material for high performance tires used on aircraft trucks and buses thaptong et al 2014 for example typical truck tires contain 80 nr whereas passenger car tires contain only 15 nr camatini et al 2001 in many cases synthetic rubber is used as a substitute for nr synthetic petroleum based rubbers are among others polyisoprene chloroprene or styrene butadiene rubber sbr depending on the chemicals added and the properties associated with them the synthetic rubber may have versatile properties such as being very hard resilient or soft sbr is characterized as more difficult to mill mix or calender than nr as well as being deficient in building tack and having relatively poor inherent physical properties the potential hazard of oils with high contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs has led to the regulation of their use in rubber manufacturing by eu directive 2005 69 ec and replacement with low pah alternatives new tires or tire tread used for retreading manufactured after the first of january 2010 may not contain any extender oil with pah concentrations exceeding certain threshold limits tires that were manufactured prior to this date are not covered by these threshold limits and may still be sold on the market sadiktsis et al 2012 2 2 tire wear particles twp 2 2 1 generation twp have been defined as particles generated mechanically by the rolling shear of tread against a surface rogge et al 1993 or by volatilization which results in the generation of much smaller particles usually in the fine mode 2 5 μm for the emission of twp the tread and shoulder of the tire are of major importance as both components may be in contact with the pavement lee et al 2013 the interaction of tires with the pavement alters both the chemical composition and the characteristics of the particles generated in this interaction compared to the original tire tread this is due to heat and friction as well as to the incorporation of material from the road surface panko et al 2013a and of other particulate traffic related emissions such as brake dust adachi and tainosho 2004 investigations on properties of twp have used material generated in one of the following ways i by real on road driving conditions using mobile units hussein et al 2008 kwak et al 2013 mathissen et al 2011 under controlled conditions where the contribution from existing road dust and minerals from the road surface present under ambient conditions is considered kumar et al 2013 wang et al 2017b ii by sampling and analysis of particles from ambient air followed by application either of source apportionment methods bukowiecki et al 2009 luhana et al 2004 or specific tire wear tracers harrison et al 2012 panko et al 2013a or iii by a road simulator in the laboratory dahl et al 2006 gustafsson et al 2008 kreider et al 2010 kupiainen et al 2005 panko et al 2009 iv alternatively twp may be generated in the laboratory using a steel brush grit paper or other abrasive media which are however not able to replicate driving conditions kreider et al 2010 the shape of twp generated on road was therefore found to be very different from that of cryogenically ground tire material which has sharper more defined edges figs 1 and 2 thus twp at the road surface and in the environment are mostly not present as pristine material and it is likely that these multicomponent twp will differ in physical and chemical properties from the original tire material table 2 it appears that knowledge on how particle generation and particle properties are connected is insufficient for example no information is available on the densities of twp these knowledge gaps obviously hamper a comprehensive prediction of the fate of these particle entities in aquatic environment 2 2 2 physical properties the size distribution and density of particles are important parameters that determine their fate in the environment abrasion of tire tread leads to the emission of twp that can be classified into coarse pm10 fine pm2 5 and ultrafine pm0 1 particles fig 1 while twp are mainly found in the coarse size fraction only 0 1 10 are estimated to become airborne pm10 and below barlow et al 2007 boulter et al 2006 panko et al 2013a wik and dave 2006 ultrafine particles are generated by a thermo mechanical process spots on the tire surface reach temperatures high enough for the evaporation of volatile tire constituents which rapidly condense and form microparticles mathissen et al 2011 despite the fact that the majority of particles emitted during wear are in the coarse fraction the research with regard to the characterization of twp size distribution has focused on airborne pm10 and pm2 5 the size distribution of twp ranges from a few nanometers to several hundred micrometers fig 1 kreider et al 2010 tested different types of tires on asphalt based pavements in a road simulator and found that the size distribution of collected twp ranged between 5 0 μm and 220 μm with a maximum abundance at 70 80 μm kreider et al 2010 there was no pm0 1 found under controlled driving conditions similar observations were made by smolders and degryse 2002 who found roadside twp with a mean diameter of 65 μm for passenger vehicles and 80 μm for trucks however a number of studies report bimodal mass size distributions with one peak in the coarse fraction and another one in the fine fraction fukahori and yamazaki 1994 gustafsson et al 2008 wang et al 2017b these discrepancies in the obtained particle size distributions can result from different conditions of particle formation in sampling and in analytical instrumentation used kreider et al 2010 which hampers the comparisons of available data for a bimodal size distribution of twp small particles pm10 originated from microvibration and larger particles in the range of a few hundred micrometers were attributed to stick slip motion fukahori and yamazaki 1994 the speed of driving and the pavement material were reported to influence the amount of particles emitted rather than their size distribution gustafsson et al 2008 kwak et al 2013 ultrafine twp have very heterogenic forms such as droplets fibers and granules these particles form agglomerates dahl et al 2006 contrary to coarser particles the ultrafine twp seem to originate from organic constituents of tires softening filler and specifically mineral oils gustafsson et al 2008 most of the particles within the fine fraction are composed mainly of carbon panko et al 2009 further studies indicated fig 2 that fine twp are elongated in shape and contain incrustations of minerals from the road surface the morphology of twp was reported as an elongated sausage like shape with a mode of circularity of 0 83 and an aspect ratio of 0 64 adachi and tainosho 2004 cadle and williams 1978 kreider et al 2010 williams and cadle 1978 other factors influencing the generation of twp are the pavement properties its composition and texture for example the pm10 concentration has been shown to increase when anti skid aggregates were used in the asphalt pavements tervahattu et al 2006 and also the pm2 5 and pm0 1 concentrations were influenced by differences in the asphalt mixtures fullova and ďurcasnka 2016 in addition twp size distribution and concentration are influenced by the adhesion mechanism of friction for which surface energy and wear pattern of the tire are of major importance vieira et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2 2 3 chemical composition depending on their formation processes twp exhibit a chemical composition that differs from the composition of the initial tire material similar to the size characterization there is more information available on the chemical composition of airborne fine twp than on coarse ones pm10 the chemical composition of twp seems to differ depending on the size range considered for example in the coarse fraction of particles the concentrations of fe ca and zn were found to be high compared to concentrations of ti and sb kwak et al 2013 in the fine fraction of particles the concentrations of fe ca ti ba and sb dominated but zn was not found kwak et al 2013 and al and si dominated in the smaller sized airborne wear particles gustafsson et al 2008 kupiainen et al 2005 panko et al 2009 sulfur was reported to be enriched in the sub micrometer fraction particularly when friction tires were tested gustafsson et al 2008 panko et al 2009 the zn contribution to the total particle mass was similar 0 3 0 4 for road collected and laboratory generated wear particles kreider et al 2010 but different between passenger vehicles 1 1 and trucks 2 4 smolders and degryse 2002 the carbonaceous fraction of twp is dominated by organic substances 88 with trace amounts of elemental carbon 4 and carbonate carbon 8 the pah composition of coarse twp and the concentrations of individual pahs varied from the mg kg range for pyrene phenanthrene and fluoranthene to not detectable concentrations of these pahs in road wear particles aatmeeyata and sharma 2010 rogge et al 1993 other sources such as asphalt automobile exhaust and fuel combustion products are often more dominant pah contributors kreider et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 the pah content of twp increased with increasing mileage of the tire aatmeeyata and sharma 2010 due to thermal degradation of tires kwon and castaldi 2012 benzothiazoles are another substance class commonly found in twp a large variety of other organic compounds have been identified in twp such as n alkanes n alkanoic acids and natural resins rogge et al 1993 2 2 4 emission of twp from automobile traffic the quantity of twp emissions is often related to the mileage the so called emission factor defines the amount of twp generated per kilometer driving distance mg km this emission factor is controlled by i tire characteristics e g size width chemical composition accumulated mileage ii vehicle characteristics e g weight engine power state of maintenance iii road surface characteristics e g material bitumen concrete texture pattern wetness temperature van der gon et al 2013 and iv vehicle operation and operation conditions e g speed linear acceleration radial acceleration extent of braking and cornering boulter et al 2006 accordingly the reported abrasion rates cover a wide range heavy duty vehicles such as trailer trucks have been reported to emit approximately ten times more twp than light duty vehicles and passenger cars for instance median twp emission factors have been reported for passenger cars with 90 mg km 53 200 mg km for trucks with 700 mg km 105 1700 mg km and for trailer trucks with 1200 mg km 1000 1500 mg km hillenbrand et al 2005 for passenger cars this agrees well to the average of data collected by councell et al 2004 with 112 mg km 16 data points and a standard deviation of 174 mg km the scatter in the experimental data may reflect the different experimental conditions laboratory or field and methods of determination tire mass loss or direct measurement absolute twp emissions at the regional scale have been calculated either based on emission factors and annual travel distances of various vehicle categories or from average weight loss of tires and the number of tires in use for germany twp emissions for 2005 were estimated based on emission factors to be 111 42 103 t a hillenbrand et al 2005 a recent review calculated population specific twp emissions for various countries including china india japan norway sweden denmark and the united states of america usa kole et al 2017 data ranged between 0 23 and 1 9 kg a capita in the investigated countries in the usa however significantly higher emission of 4 7 kg a capita were found because of longer travel distances per capita kole et al 2017 a new estimation of the quantity of twp emissions was performed here for germany the european union eu and the usa for different vehicles categories and for urban and rural roads table 3 these considerations are important for the identification and localization of most relevant sources for example trucks on highways twp emissions in germany and the usa were calculated based on average emission factors provided by hillenbrand et al 2005 and recent data on total travel distance on highways and urban roads for various vehicle categories including passenger cars trucks busses and trailer trucks bäumer et al 2017 our estimation of twp emissions in the eu is based on car registration data and average traveled distances for each vehicle category based on this data we estimate that 133 103 t a twp were released in 2014 in germany table 3 this exceeds the amount estimated for 2005 by 20 see above emissions were dominated by trucks and busses 60 largest distances in germany are traveled on highways and rural roads with 550 109 km followed by urban areas with 190 109 km table 3 accordingly 70 of the twp emissions are likely generated on highways and rural roads and 30 in cities table 3 according to our estimation using data from 2010 in the usa twp emissions from passenger cars and trucks are of equal importance and sum up to 1120 103 t a table 3 a portion of 66 of these emissions occurs in urban environments compared to less than 30 in germany this difference is primarily due to the much higher urban travel distances in the usa table 3 which have been reported earlier councell et al 2004 this estimate of twp emissions for the usa are higher than earlier ones due to an increase in automobile traffic pierson and brachaczek 1974 estimated 600 103 t a of tire wear for the usa in 1974 a more recent publication by councell et al 2004 estimated zn emissions in the usa originating from twp in 1999 from this data twp emissions were deduced to be between 900 103 t a and 1000 103 t a assuming tire wear contains 1 1 wt zn smolders and degryse 2002 in the eu the total number of registered passenger cars and trucks was 210 106 and 36 106 respectively eu 2016 eurostat 2017 in 2014 the average distance traveled in the eu was approximated from average distances traveled in germany for passenger cars trucks and busses it is noted that average travel distance of trucks in germany might be higher compared to the eu average because of the high proportion of transit traffic in germany in total 260 103 t a twp are estimated to be emitted by passenger cars and 1100 103 t a twp by trucks including busses these emissions could not be further attributed to highway rural and urban roads due to the lack of data on the respective travel distances while engine exhaust emissions have decreased continuously during the last decades as a result of technical improvements the non exhaust emission remained constant or increased with rising traffic van der gon et al 2013 this global development is expected to continue due to a growth of automobile traffic goonetilleke et al 2017 leading to an increase in twp emissions the differentiation between vehicle categories makes clear that passenger cars and trucks emit almost equal percentage of twp in germany and the usa in germany twp emissions occur predominantly on highways whereas in the usa urban roads are more important table 3 in order to assess the environmental importance of twp emissions one may compare them with other non exhaust traffic emissions comprising of brake wear road wear and tire wear total traffic related emissions are composed of approximately 5 30 tire wear harrison et al 2012 due to complex generation processes the individual share of non exhaust emission components varies for instance studded tires exhibit much higher road surface erosion rates than non studded tires gültlinger et al 2014 lindbom et al 2007 the vehicle category plays another important role for medium sized cars for example road wear dominates non exhaust emissions and twp mass fraction equals approximately 30 of the total non exhaust emissions simons 2016 fig 3 twp emissions may also be compared with the emission of other classes of xenobiotic compounds for germany the estimated twp emission of 133 103 t a table 3 is four times the amount of active substances of pesticides used and released into the environment per year approx 33 103 t a in 2016 bvl 2017 and 16 times the amount of environmentally relevant human pharmaceuticals 8 1 103 t a in 2012 ebert et al 2014 however pesticides and pharmaceuticals are emitted in dissolved form while twp are released as particles with respect to the aquatic environment however it would be important to know which portion of the emitted twp ultimately ends up in surface waters this is controlled by the environmental fate of twp 3 analytical methods to determine the amount of twp in the environment this section focuses on methods suitable for the determination of the amount of twp in environmental samples such as dust sediments soil or water neither does it consider methods for the analysis of tire constituents directly from tires nor methods for the determination of tire born dissolved compounds in the aqueous phase after their release from tires the determination of the amount of twp in environmental samples requires an increase in sensitivity and selectivity with increasing distance between the source of twp emission and the sampling site the concentration of twp is expected to decrease with this distance while the complexity of the matrix and the importance of other sources increase for these reasons analytical methods developed for tire analysis are usually not suitable for the determination of twp from environmental samples also methods to determine tire particles in road dust with higher twp contributions may not work for roadside soils with a lower portion of twp analytical strategies to determine the amount of twp in environmental samples involve the determination of either the rubber sbr or nr as the major constituent of tires or of additives from the tire material that serve as markers for tires a marker should ideally fulfill the following criteria be present in all tire materials in comparable portion largely independent from manufacturer or manufacturing process not leach easily from tire particles into the surrounding environment not be easily transformed while the tire particles reside in the environment air water soil be sufficiently specific for tires namely not present in relevant concentration in other traffic related particulate matter such as brake dust roadway particles or surface runoff have a concentration in tire material significantly higher than in the particles forming the sample matrix soil sediment road dust suspended matter aerosol be analytically accessible by methods of high precision accuracy and sensitivity at reasonable analytical effort markers may either be metals or organic compounds the major elements considered as markers for twp are zn used as activator in the vulcanization process and s originating from various reduced organic sulfur species that are used as vulcanization accelerators rogge et al 1993 a variety of organic marker constituents have also been tested as discussed in more detail below 3 1 detection of twp particles from dust and water the detection of individual twp is of interest when particulate matter has been collected on filters e g by aerosol sampling with impactors for the detection of twp on filters spatially resolved analytical methods have been employed spectroscopic methods like raman spectroscopy however cannot be used as the black twp do not deliver a specific spectrum instead the determination of marker elements may help for example energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edxs has been used to detect twp in dust collected in the laboratory environment using its s and zn signature adachi and tainosho 2004 camatini et al 2001 fig 4 the authors noted however that this approach was not selective enough to identify tire particles in road dust collected from the environment as there are many other sources for zn like brake dust and paint used for road marking obviously these approaches are limited to situations where the contribution of twp to the particulate fraction of samples is comparatively large moreover the suitability of these methods for quantitative analyses remains questionable in principle twp detection by spatially resolved analysis of filters should also be suitable for the detection of twp in water samples after filtration however this application has not been reported yet 3 2 sediments and soils for more complex particulate samples or more diluted conditions the detection of each single twp is not feasible any longer then elemental analysis may be used to determine the total quantity of twp mass from sample digests complete digestion of tire material is however challenging often particulate matter remains in the digest this is not critical provided that only the sio2 filler remains otherwise it may lead to an underestimation of the true value strong acids nitric acid sulfuric acid perchloric acid elevated temperature 100 c and digestion times of several hours are therefore used kocher et al 2010 smolders and degryse 2002 metal determination in the diluted digest may involve aas icp oes kocher et al 2010 smolders and degryse 2002 or icp ms depending on the sensitivity required and the number of elements to be detected although some elements namely al na and fe exhibit higher concentrations than zn in tires they are not suited as elemental markers for twp as their environmental concentrations e g in soil are typically even higher kocher et al 2010 rhodes et al 2012 studied the loss of zn from tire particles some leaching of zn occurred but the zn content of the tire particles was not significantly reduced thus leaching did not limit the use of zn as marker of twp as mentioned above there are other traffic related sources that emit particulate zn moreover particulate zn may be formed in the aqueous phase in urban environments by adsorption or precipitation of dissolved zn2 ions that are discharged with surface runoff and originate from gutterings facades road signs and other surfaces plated with zn councell et al 2004 this further limits the specificity of particulate zn as tire marker in samples that are influenced by surface runoff such as from sewers urban creeks and receiving waters to increase selectivity fauser et al 1999 proposed not to determine the total zn content of particulate samples but more specifically the zinc accelerator complexes organic zinc as marker of twp the analytical approach first involves the extraction of the organo zn complexes from particulate matter by dichloromethane followed by digestion of the organic extract with nitric acid and determination of total zn in the digest fauser et al 1999 unfortunately there may be other traffic related sources of organo zinc such as engine oil fauser et al 1999 additionally unice et al 2013 pointed out that the solvent dichloromethane does not reliably exclude inorganic zno from extraction both aspects would lead to an overestimation of the content of twp in environmental samples and question the suitability of organo zinc as tire marker rubber is the major component and the backbone of tires therefore it seems straightforward to determine the amount of rubber if one is interested in the amount of twp in a sample however rubber is a polymer of high molecular weight which is not amenable as such to chemical analysis therefore rubber determination involves destructive measures that generate rubber specific volatile breakdown products typically by pyrolysis where the sample is heated to temperatures of 600 800 c for a few seconds the volatile products are transferred to and analyzed by gas chromatography either by gc fid or by gc ms unice et al 2012 the markers generated by rubber pyrolysis and determined by gc are styrene for sbr lee et al 1989 saito 1989 unice et al 2012 and isoprene or dipentene 1 methyl 4 isopropylcyclohexene for nr lee et al 1989 saito 1989 unice et al 2012 fig 5 some authors also included vinylcyclohexene and butadiene as sbr markers cadle and williams 1980 unice et al 2012 usually py gc is applied to the entire particulate sample to increase sensitivity the rubber of a sample can first be extracted and then only the extract is subjected to py gc rubber is however not easily brought into solution so that comparatively harsh extraction conditions have to be used cadle and williams 1980 py gc ms suffers from limited precision to improve this unice et al 2012 have added defined amounts of an internal standard material to the sample that generates a deuterated volatile monomer deuterated poly butadiene or poly isoprene which can be analyzed together with the rubber markers unice et al 2012 py gc ms methods were typically applied to road dust lee et al 1989 panko et al 2013a saito 1989 and to soils unice et al 2012 the most recent studies reached method detection limits of 2 30 μg g in soil depending on the kind of rubber unice et al 2012 and 300 800 μg g from 1 mg of dust collected on a filter panko et al 2013a many organic compounds are added during rubber and tire manufacturing see section 2 most of them are however not suited as markers because they are not specific for tires but have also other traffic related sources for example pahs and aliphatic hydrocarbons are present in tires but they are also found in asphalt automobile exhausts and fuel combustion products kreider et al 2010 one class of chemicals that have been used as markers of twp are benzothiazoles fig 6 2 4 morpholinyl benzothiazole 24mobt from the vulcanization accelerator obs and n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazolamine ncba from the accelerator cbs which contains mainly n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazolesulfenamide kumata et al 2002 spies et al 1987 cbs is the more frequently used vulcanization accelerator kumata et al 2002 and was claimed to be also the more environmentally friendly one pan et al 2012 during the vulcanization process however these vulcanization accelerators are transformed to a large extent less than 1 of cbs was found to survive the curing of rubber unice et al 2015 owing to the tight structure of rubber the extraction of organic constituents from tire material requires comparatively harsh conditions obviously such harsh conditions are also required to extract tire markers from environmental samples provided that they are still fixed in the rubber matrix as they should be most extraction methods involve soxhlet extraction using solvent mixtures such as benzene methanol 6 4 v v kumata et al 1996 toluene methanol 1 1 v v kumata et al 2000 or dichloromethane acetone 1 1 v v ni et al 2008 to date accelerated solvent extraction ase may be applicable instead but this would need to be validated while a clean up may not be required for extracts of tire material itself this becomes increasingly important with increasing distance from the emission source as the concentration of tire particles decreases while the portion of sample matrix increases moreover the harsh extraction conditions further increase the matrix content in an extract clean up procedures for benzothiazole analysis involved partitioning between an organic and an aqueous phase making use of the acid base properties of ncba and mobt kumata et al 2000 and column clean up with deactivated silica kumata et al 1996 or alumina silica mixes 1 2 in volume ni et al 2008 the instrumentation that has been used for the determination of the benzothiazole marker compounds in sample extracts reflects the general development in analytical instrumentation with gc based methods used initially first with gc fpd selective for sulfur kumata et al 2002 1996 then with gc ms ni et al 2008 and from the 2000s onwards complemented by lc ms avagyan et al 2013 kloepfer et al 2004 reemtsma 2000 the benzothiazole marker compounds 24mobt and ncba clearly show the challenges related to the use of organic markers for tires in a heterogeneous environment only a low portion of the cbs accelerator added to rubber before curing is found afterwards as ncba while other benzothiazoles namely mercapto benzothiazole mbt and also cyclohexylamine were more relevant unice et al 2015 indeed many other benzothiazoles are present in tire rubber like benzothiazole itself the mbt and its methylation product methylthiobenzothiazole mtbt as well as the oxidation product mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide mbts avagyan et al 2013 due to their lower molecular weight and a higher polarity these transformation products are preferentially leached from tire particles which makes them unsuited as alternate markers for tire particles unice et al 2015 benzothiazoles found in the aqueous phase may also have other sources kloepfer et al 2005 and are subjected to transformation processes reemtsma et al 1995 thus it is not fully clear yet to which extent the two benzothiazoles ncba and mobt are reliable tire markers two other compounds were therefore tested for their suitability as tire markers the vulcanization agent 1 3 diphenylguanidine dpg and the antioxidant n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl 1 4 phenylenediamine 6 ppd fig 6 both were more stable than the benzothiazoles during curing with approximately 50 loss dpg is partially transformed into the water soluble and easily leachable aniline unice et al 2015 4 aminodiphenylamine was found as degradation product of the antioxidant 6 ppd but the number of possible transformation products was much larger unice et al 2015 6 ppd is also less prone to leaching as it is comparatively hydrophobic logkow 4 unice et al 2015 while the antioxidant 6 ppd is also reported to be used in lubricants and dyes prosser et al 2017 its major application is in elastomers krüger et al 2005 on this basis one may consider 6 ppd an interesting candidate as marker for twp that deserves more scientific scrutiny resin acids namely dehydroabietic acid dha are added during rubber manufacturing as emulsifiers rogge et al 1993 and have recently been proposed as an alternative marker for twp kumata et al 2011 resin acids such as dha do have however many natural sources in biogeochemistry for example resin acids are considered biomarkers for the input from conifers medeiros and simoneit 2008 elevated levels of dha in the environment have also been related to discharges from pulp and paper production leppänen and oikari 1999 questioning the specificity of dha as marker it appears that satisfactory analytical approaches to determine the amount of twp in environmental samples are not readily available the analytical challenges increase with increasing distance from a source of emission while benzothiazoles have been proposed as markers they cannot fulfill many of the criteria needed 6 ppd appears an interesting but yet poorly studied alternative another option is to improve methods for the determination of rubber as such rather than searching for novel markers 4 occurrence and behavior of twp in the aquatic environment 4 1 role of particulate twp mass flow the concentration of twp in soil or water is determined by transport into these environmental compartments translocation transformation and degradation within these compartments as well as by transport out of these compartments the predominant portion of twp is coarse 10 μm and is assumed to remain at the road side cadle and williams 1979 dannis 1974 once generated and deposited twp are subjected to interaction with other traffic related particles from brakes tire pavement street furniture as well as with atmospheric deposition which results in the formation of aggregates charters et al 2015 this makes it difficult to distinguish between individual particle types sources adachi and tainosho 2004 hence most of the studies on traffic related particles were based on the so called total non exhaust traffic related particle emission or road deposited sediments consequently there is insufficient information specifically on the occurrence and behavior of twp depending on their size twp and their aggregates are eventually transported off the street by surface runoff by street cleaning or transferred into the atmosphere by resuspension huber et al 2016 wicke et al 2012 mobilization of twp by road runoff may lead to a translocation especially during stormwater events aryal et al 2010 the translocation of twp by rainfall strongly depends on the infrastructure installed for the collection and treatment of road runoff water in case there is no runoff sewer installed twp are likely quantitatively transferred to the roadside soil and to some extent to the nearest waterway if road runoff is collected in separate sewer systems a runoff treatment is usually foreseen before the water is discharged into receiving waters or percolated into groundwater barbosa et al 2012 in the centers of urban areas of industrialized countries surface runoff is often collected in sewers combined with municipal wastewater and treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants although no data on twp removal in wastewater treatment plants are available data on microplastics removal may allow a rough estimate removals exceeding 96 have been reported for microplastic in municipal wastewater treatment plants magnusson and norén 2014 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 but small particles are less efficiently removed compared to larger ones 300 μm kole et al 2017 on this basis one may expect removal efficiencies above 90 for twp 300 μm and lower removal for twp 300 μm in municipal wastewater treatment plants in the case of strong rainfall events however combined sewer overflow may occur and the wastewater be discharged into surface waters without any treatment reemtsma et al 2000 the majority of treatment of road runoff collected in separate sewer systems are based on filtration or sedimentation aryal et al 2010 their efficiency is strongly depending on the treatment process and on the properties of the particulate material hallberg et al 2007 jotte et al 2017 the runoff waters are typically characterized by high total suspended solid and high metal concentration as well as a bimodal particle size distribution with maxima between 6 10 μm and 70 100 μm brombach et al 2005 charters et al 2016 huber et al 2016 the mass percentage of particle sizes 63 μm so called fine sediments varies between 17 wt and 100 wt charters et al 2015 a survey on treatment systems revealed that removal efficiencies increase with increasing particle size and increasing hydraulic retention time for metals partitioned in the fine sediment fraction 63 μm retention in settling ponds is unlikely charters et al 2015 hilliges et al 2017 and removal efficiency is typically below 50 boogaard et al 2017 leading to metal emissions of zn and ni for instance gill et al 2017 reported average removal efficiencies of 86 for zn in a wetland with long hydraulic retention times gill et al 2017 whereas fettig et al 2017 showed that lamella sedimentation systems removed only 21 of particulate zn fettig et al 2017 therefore twp might not be efficiently removed in runoff treatment systems that are based on sedimentation with only short hydraulic retention times under high hydraulic loads removal rates of twp are expected to decline in sedimentation ponds and twp can be flushed out gill et al 2017 it has been observed that during stormwater events twp concentrations increased in the receiving water body kumata et al 2000 rural roads are mostly not equipped with a sewer and road runoff is treated only passively by percolation data on coverage of runoff treatment systems is not available therefore it is not possible to estimate the global amounts of twp that reach aquatic environments such estimation can be performed only on the local scale if adequate information is available for example twp concentrations were determined locally in road runoff ni et al 2008 unice et al 2013 wik and dave 2009 environmental twp concentrations were estimated based on marker concentrations because analytical methods for the reliable determination of twp concentrations in the environment are not available see section 4 such estimated data are available for road dust road surfaces soils in the close vicinity of the road road runoff settling ponds wastewater effluent river sediments and air fig 7 as one may expect twp concentrations appear to decrease with increased distance from the road highest concentrations were detected in tunnels and soils next to the road fig 7 towards the receiving water body twp concentration decreases because particles are being retained already at the road side and due to dilution contamination of groundwater by twp transported through the unsaturated soil zone is unlikely however groundwater contamination may occur by dissolved twp constituents that were leached from twp at the soil surface padoan et al 2017 twp concentrations in sediment are higher than those in surface water fig 7 because particles settle down and accumulate in the sediments correspondingly not only sediments in runoff treatment ponds but also sediments in the receiving water body act as a sink for twp fig 7 thus the question arises under which conditions twp accumulate in the sediment in principle the finer fraction of twp is expected to be easily transported during runoff while the coarser particles are more effectively retained because they settle in drainage channels canals and gully pots loganathan et al 2013 occurrence and characterization i e particle size distributions and chemical composition of road deposited sediments and other sum parameters for example total suspended solids have been studied in a number of case studies throughout the world sutherland et al 2012 wang et al 2017b zhou et al 2017 research focusing explicitly on twp specific properties and the processes affecting the fate of twp such as aggregation sedimentation or aging are still lacking in order to link twp emission environmental concentration and effects in various compartments it is crucial to understand the processes controlling the mass flow of twp from their source to surface waters and to determine the mass flows from sources to surface water in this review the yearly mass of twp entering water bodies is estimated for german highways twp emission from highways is estimated with 48 x 103 t a table 3 a portion of 10 of this is emitted into the atmosphere while the remaining mass is deposited on the road or at the road side the amount being retained and the amount reaching the receiving water body depends on the collection and treatment infrastructure two scenarios are calculated assuming that a 50 of the deposited twp are mobilized via surface runoff kaufmann et al 2007 and b that only 15 are mobilized hillenbrand et al 2005 the remaining twp accumulate at the road side in both scenarios it is assumed that all surface runoff is treated prior to full discharge into the receiving water body with no infiltration into the soil and that the average treatment efficiency is 50 twp removal fig 8 illustrates the mass flows of twp for both scenarios the mass of twp from highways estimated to reach the receiving german water body ranges from 3000 t a scenario b to 11 000 t a scenario a corresponding to 6 and 23 of the total twp emission respectively kole et al 2017 estimated twp release in the aquatic environment with approximately 7 of the total twp emission in the netherlands which is similar to the estimation in scenario a in case no treatment systems are in place twp outflow into the aquatic environment increases to 13 and 45 of the total emitted twp for scenarios a and b respectively these estimations are solely based on assumptions and need to be verified by field data however the results underline the importance of road and roadside management as well as the possible efficiency of runoff treatment systems regarding the prevention of twp release into the aquatic environment once emitted into surface waters twp will distribute further literature data on twp concentrations in rivers and sediments fig 7 suggest that sedimentation is an important process that removes twp from the surface waters correspondingly twp concentrations of 400 2200 μg g in river sediments have been determined ni et al 2008 unice et al 2013 wik and dave 2009 4 1 1 twp relevant fate processes at their point of emission on road surfaces twp may aggregate with other twp homoaggregation or other particles heteroaggregation with increasing distance from the road homoaggregation is likely to be negligible due to the decreasing twp concentration fig 7 compared to the concentrations of other particles heteroaggregation with suspended particulate matter is strongly influenced by particle sizes and densities therezien et al 2014 while particle size distributions of twp and their aggregates have been reported see section 2 2 other important physical properties such as twp density or surface charge have not been reported yet one may assume that twp density depends upon their composition while carbon black has a density of 1 8 g cm3 the density of sbr ranges from 0 94 to 1 04 g cm3 depending on its styrene portion sigma aldrich 2013 2012a 2012b the density of shredded tire materials has been reported to range between 1 13 and 1 16 g cm3 rhodes et al 2012 the lower densities of twp compared to other road derived particles e g asphalt 2 36 g cm3 rumble 2017 or suspended particulate matter e g quartz 2 65 or limestone 2 0 g cm3 rumble 2017 lead to the assumption that pure twp have a high potential to remain in suspension and be transported over longer distances while twp heteroaggregates with a higher density would be subjected to sedimentation this illustrates the need to investigate aggregation processes of twp in more detail as found for other particulate matter such as nanoparticles and microplastics one may assume that heteroaggregation is dependent on the surface characteristics of the twp and thus also affected by the characteristics of the surrounding water e g its ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter besseling et al 2017 praetorius et al 2014 smith et al 2015 furthermore aging processes may change the properties of twp in the aquatic environment these processes may involve mechanical stress oxidation as long as twp are not deposited in sediments as well as microbial colonization and degradation considering the major components of twp rubber and carbon black it can be expected that twp in the aquatic environment are persistent and degrade only slowly the available data do not allow to conclude on twp mass flows in the aquatic environment beyond those shown in fig 8 reliable information and data on infrastructure to collect and treat road runoff on the dynamics of twp transport e g mobilization during stormwater events as well as treatment efficiency for particles 50 μm would be required to estimate environmental concentrations of twp more precisely furthermore experimental or model based studies on the fate processes of twp are needed the latter could be achieved similar to the development of nanoparticle models first simple mass flow models evolved into validated spatiotemporal explicit models gottschalk et al 2013 for other particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials or microplastics complex transport models were developed besseling et al 2017 domercq et al 2018 praetorius et al 2014 these models simulate explicit spatial and temporal hydrodynamic particle behavior and account for advective transport particle aggregation sedimentation and resuspension such modeling approaches could be adapted for twp in smaller and larger size ranges this would be necessary to allow the identification of relevant fate processes and potential mitigation strategies 4 1 2 compounds released from twp the quality of the aquatic environment may be affected by the introduction of twp as particulate entities however also compounds released from twp and transferred into the aqueous phase may affect water quality the leaching from twp exposed to water has been investigated for a wide spectrum of substances including heavy metals such as zn smolders and degryse 2002 cu cd cr and pb malmstrom 1956 and organics such as pahs and benzothiazoles reddy and quinn 1997 wik and dave 2009 leaching from tire materials has been investigated in laboratory leaching studies e g tire crumb or tire wear the experimental conditions strongly affect the outcome of the experiment for example the removal of the metal wires from crumb rubbers minimized leaching of fe and manganese selbes et al 2015 the influence of the particle size on leaching from twp is inconclusive as organic carbon and zn were found to be leached more effectively from smaller particle sizes whereas the leaching of some elements were found to be independent from particles sizes of tire crumb rubber rhodes et al 2012 for zn it has been shown that leaching was reduced with both increasing salinity and ph of the leaching solution degaffe and turner 2011 on the contrary no effect of ph was observed for leaching of na and s from tire materials selbes et al 2015 for other compounds however systematic studies on the effect of the composition of the leaching solution its ionic strength e g mono divalent cations or natural organic matter on the extent of leaching are missing and should be included in future research a mechanistic interpretation of leaching results would require knowledge on the chemical speciation in the twp matrix as well as on the factors and constraints governing their dissolution this information is missing in many cases as the organic and inorganic species present in tire material vary among tire models and may be altered in the production process as well as during tire use for example zn accelerators inconsistent results have been obtained regarding the influence of physico chemical properties methodological parameters sampling analytics hydrochemical conditions ph ionic strength on leaching degaffe and turner 2011 rhodes et al 2012 selbes et al 2015 thus experimental parameters should be described in detail for each study to allow a comparison of the results obtained the leaching of pahs from tires was either investigated using samples obtained by artificial abrasion of the tire using files or knifes etc aatmeeyata and sharma 2010 sadiktsis et al 2012 or by sampling traffic related particles boonyatumanond et al 2007 rogge et al 1993 takada et al 1990 with highly variable results therefore the use of shredded tires is not recommended it should be taken into account that most substances leaching from twp may also have other sources such other sources are other traffic related particles or traffic area runoff including wear of brakes vehicle components pavement materials road equipment and road maintenance activities dongarra et al 2007 hjortenkrans et al 2007 johansson et al 2009 moreno et al 2006 querol et al 2007 shah et al 2006 other contributions may stem from point sources such as steel plants and other industrial activities in cities espinosa et al 2004 querol et al 2007 shah et al 2006 and corrosion of metallic material alongside streets it has been estimated that e g the largest portion of zn in stormwater runoff originates from building materials 70 rather than from twp and that most pah stem from atmospheric deposition 40 petrucci et al 2014 a detailed apportionment of the contribution of dissolved compounds from twp is necessary to assess whether aside from potential risks connected to the particulate twp themselves twp act as a significant source of dissolved compounds for receiving waters 5 effects on biota in the aquatic environment effects on biota can be caused by physical interactions between particle and organism often related to particle size and shape and or by toxic compounds released from the particles skjolding et al 2016 the majority of studies examined effects of twp leachates independent from the environmental compartment only a few studies considered different environmental compartments e g surface water sediments and soil table 4 most investigations focused on airborne twp which is reflected by the high number of available publications gustafsson et al 2008 mantecca et al 2010 2009 in order to study toxicity of twp in the aquatic environment leaching tests in aquatic media in the absence of soil and sediment were conducted after leaching the twp were removed and only the leachate was used for toxicity testing toxicity of twp leachates was related to the presence of zn other toxic metals like pb and cd as well as organic compounds like benzothiazole derivatives phthalates phenolic derivatives hydrocarbons aromatic amines and resin acids wik and dave 2009 in fact several studies found zn and organic compounds to be among the most important leachable tire constituents turner and rice 2010 wik et al 2009 treatment of leachates with ion exchange columns or spe columns led to significantly reduced toxicity indicating that not only metals are responsible for toxicity but also lipophilic organic compounds wik et al 2009 pahs bound to tires are not easily extracted even under harsh extraction conditions the bioavailability of pahs from twp to organisms in the environment is expected to be low kreider et al 2010 the acute effect concentrations of twp in aquatic media including marine environments were found to cover a range of 25 100 000 mg twp l while chronic effect concentrations vary from 10 to 3600 mg twp l varying test designs tire materials and species sensitivity might be responsible for a high variability of leachate toxicity data turner and rice 2010 wik and dave 2009 it was shown that twp leachates have sublethal effects i e teratogenic mutagenic and estrogenic effects the twp concentrations at which these sublethal effects were shown ranged between an equivalent of 500 mg twp l and 500 000 mg twp l wik and dave 2009 these twp concentrations in water do not represent realistic environmental conditions even a dilution to 1 would represent extremely contaminated water equivalent to 500 mg twp l reported environmental concentrations in river water and settling ponds do not exceed 10 mg twp l fig 7 only in surface runoff twp concentrations 100 mg l have been reported as reported earlier twp from road simulators are not appropriate to study ecotoxicological effects because they behave differently compared to real twp kreider et al 2010 twp toxicity in soils and sediments is most probably linked to leaching of toxic constituents panko et al 2013b twp from a road simulator were mixed with sediment and the leachate was not acutely toxic under environmental relevant conditions temperature and twp concentration marwood et al 2011 panko et al 2013b conclusively the risk of leachate toxicity resulting from twp in sediments is low since observed effects were low or absent at twp concentrations of up to 10 000 mg twp kg sediment panko et al 2013b in order to study chronic toxicity of twp in sediments the accumulation of leached zn from weathered twp by amphibians rana sylvatica during larval development was analyzed and compared to zncl2 spiked soils zn was shown to be bioavailable from twp and zncl2 there were no significant differences in effects between both sublethal effects were observed however increased mortality of larvae could not be observed at a statistically significant level and an impact on amphibian survival in traffic influenced environments cannot be expected from the presence of twp camponelli et al 2009 to assess the risk of twp in the aquatic environment two requirements have to be fulfilled environmental exposure conditions e g twp concentration have to be known and test conditions have to be selected keeping environmental conditions in mind from the reviewed studies however it can be concluded that effects vary due to inconsistent experimental conditions and the heterogeneous nature of twp composition further the applied test conditions differed strongly from environmental conditions as either twp concentrations were well above expected environmental concentrations or the leaching conditions were harsher than in the environment these test results are therefore hardly suitable for an environmental risk assessment of twp 6 conclusions based on this review the following conclusions can be drawn twp are a mixture of tire wear and particulate matter from the pavement or road dust the share of twp of non exhaust emissions from traffic was estimated to 5 30 the amount of twp generated in germany 2014 the european union 2014 and the usa 2010 were re estimated as 0 13 106 t a 1 3 106 t a and 1 1 106 t a the infrastructure for collection of surface runoff and the conditions of its treatment determine how much of the released twp eventually reaches surface water estimates are highly uncertain and vary between 0 1 and 10 of twp emissions for germany between 3000 and 10 000 t a were estimated to reach surface waters concentrations of twp are estimated to range from micrograms per litre in surface water to milligrams per kilogram in sediments suggesting that sediments act as a sink for twp ecotoxicity studies mostly used unrealistically high concentrations and leachates of laboratory produced tire particles rather than real twp direct effects of twp have rarely been studied the following research needs are seen novel twp markers should be found and analytical methods be developed for the determination of twp concentration in various environmental compartments knowledge on physico chemical properties of twp e g particle density particle size distribution in water surface charge should be improved to assess transport and fate of twp in surface waters novel analytical methods should be used to determine the flux of twp and their environmental concentrations an assessment should be made on the mass flows of elements and chemicals related to the twp fluxes in comparison to inputs from other sources ecotoxicity studies should be performed involving real twp and should consider possible direct effects of particles on the basis of improved exposure and effect data the risks related to twp in the aquatic environment should be assessed conflicts of interest we declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was funded in part by the german

and thorsten hüffer are equal first authors tire wear particles twp generated from tire material during use on roads have gained increasing attention as part of organic particulate contaminants such as microplastic in aquatic environments the available information on properties and generation of twp analytical techniques to determine twp emissions occurrence and behavior and ecotoxicological effects of twp are reviewed with a focus on surface water as a potential receptor twp emissions are traffic related and contribute 5 30 to non exhaust emissions from traffic the mass of twp generated is estimated at 1 327 000 t a for the european union 1 120 000 t a for the united states and 133 000 t a for germany for germany this is equivalent to four times the amount of pesticides used the mass of twp ultimately entering the aquatic environment strongly depends on the extent of collection and treatment of road runoff which is highly variable for the german highways it is estimated that up to 11 000 t a of twp reach surface waters data on twp concentrations in the environment including surface waters are fragmentary which is also due to the lack of suitable analytical methods for their determination information on twp properties such as density and size distribution are missing this hampers assessing the fate of twp in the aquatic environment effects in the aquatic environment may stem from twp itself or from compounds released from twp it is concluded that reliable knowledge on transport mechanism to surface waters concentrations in surface waters and sediments effects of aging environmental half lives of twp as well as effects on aquatic organisms are missing these aspects need to be addressed to allow for the assessment of risk of twp in an aquatic environment

of plastic debris and microplastics in the aquatic environment has raised the awareness that organic contaminants reach the aquatic environment not only in dissolved but also in particulate form it has been recognized that both the plastic particle as a physical entity and the plastic particle constituents as chemicals may cause adverse effects to the ecosystems research on microplastic has only focused on thermoplastic material like polyethylene or polystyrene and did not consider elastomers such as rubber according to iso rubber is not covered by the definition for plastic iso 2013 while others suggest to use a more general definition for microplastic that covers all man made macromolecular materials and would thus include rubber verschoor 2015 one of the most relevant sources for rubber emissions is automobile traffic kole et al 2017 while total traffic related non exhaust particulate emissions have been estimated and recognized as potential environmental contaminants less data is available specifically on tire wear particles twp which are formed from tires undergoing friction on the road this is astonishing as twp were suggested as a major contributor of metals e g zn released into the environment councell et al 2004 goonetilleke et al 2017 twp emissions split up into airborne and non airborne emissions non airborne emissions make up 90 99 9 of the total twp emissions and can be found deposited on the road or at the road side panko et al 2013a while the fate and effects of airborne twp have been investigated intensively amato et al 2014 grigoratos and martini 2015 thorpe and harrison 2008 van der gon et al 2013 the non airborne twp are far less studied it is expected that surface runoff transports twp from the road or road side towards wastewater treatment plants or the receiving water body huber et al 2016 this may lead to pollution of surface waters and the pedosphere data on twp pollution of surface waters as well as on their concentration and fate in surface waters are rare it is known that particle properties and local conditions such as rain intensity and infrastructure control twp accumulation and transport goonetilleke et al 2017 for instance in highway runoff total suspended solid concentration is efficiently reduced by more than 80 in sedimentation ponds vollertsen et al 2007 or wetlands gill et al 2017 in many cases surface runoff from rural roads is not collected and twp may accumulate at the road side and distribute further kole et al 2017 however quantitative data on twp accumulation and distribution are not available environmental concentrations of twp have been assessed based on twp marker concentrations kumata et al 1996 pant and harrison 2013 wik and dave 2009 twp markers are tire constituents which occur in specific concentrations in tire material this approach is limited due to multiple sources of most available marker substances and variations of the marker content in the tires therefore source apportionment of non exhaust emission has been largely hampered thorpe and harrison 2008 by the lack of reliable data due to missing analytical methods typically twp are composed of rubber filling agents oils vulcanization agents and further additives kreider et al 2010 due to interactions with other particulate matter twp are subjected to changes in morphology and composition which makes it difficult to track and quantify them in the environment twp are often examined in conjunction with the pavement material as it is not easy to distinguish between these two sources amato et al 2014 boulter et al 2006 harrison et al 2012 kreider et al 2010 therefore this review uses the term twp for all particles originating from tire abrasion this review assesses information and data on properties and generation of twp analytical techniques to determine twp emission occurrence and behavior and ecotoxicological effects focusing on the surface waters as potential receptor we thereby aim i to address the relevance of twp for the aquatic environment and ii to identify data and information gaps which have to be closed in order to be able to conclude on risks related to the occurrence of twp in surface waters 2 characteristics of tire wear particles and their emission into the environment 2 1 tire materials tire materials are complex mixtures as various chemicals are used during the production of tires besides the rubber itself fillers reinforcement agents processing aids accelerators and retarders adhesives and activators may be added table 1 despite consistent usage of the general ingredients the composition of a specific tire depends on its application for example a common sized all season passenger commercial tire contains approximately 30 types of synthetic and 8 natural rubbers 8 kinds of carbon black steel cord for belts polyester and nylon fiber steel bead wire and 40 different chemicals waxes oils pigments silica and clays baumann and ismeier 1998 natural rubber nr is a linear polymer of isoprene 2 methyl butadiene due to its high structural regularity natural rubber tends to crystallize spontaneously at low temperatures or when it is stretched the polymer network of nr allows the elasticity and flexibility to be combined with crystallization induced strength and toughness through the vulcanization of raw nr with sulfur or hardening with carbon black as filler baumann and ismeier 1998 given the superior performance in terms of tear strength and heat resistance nr is the preferred material for high performance tires used on aircraft trucks and buses thaptong et al 2014 for example typical truck tires contain 80 nr whereas passenger car tires contain only 15 nr camatini et al 2001 in many cases synthetic rubber is used as a substitute for nr synthetic petroleum based rubbers are among others polyisoprene chloroprene or styrene butadiene rubber sbr depending on the chemicals added and the properties associated with them the synthetic rubber may have versatile properties such as being very hard resilient or soft sbr is characterized as more difficult to mill mix or calender than nr as well as being deficient in building tack and having relatively poor inherent physical properties the potential hazard of oils with high contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs has led to the regulation of their use in rubber manufacturing by eu directive 2005 69 ec and replacement with low pah alternatives new tires or tire tread used for retreading manufactured after the first of january 2010 may not contain any extender oil with pah concentrations exceeding certain threshold limits tires that were manufactured prior to this date are not covered by these threshold limits and may still be sold on the market sadiktsis et al 2012 2 2 tire wear particles twp 2 2 1 generation twp have been defined as particles generated mechanically by the rolling shear of tread against a surface rogge et al 1993 or by volatilization which results in the generation of much smaller particles usually in the fine mode 2 5 μm for the emission of twp the tread and shoulder of the tire are of major importance as both components may be in contact with the pavement lee et al 2013 the interaction of tires with the pavement alters both the chemical composition and the characteristics of the particles generated in this interaction compared to the original tire tread this is due to heat and friction as well as to the incorporation of material from the road surface panko et al 2013a and of other particulate traffic related emissions such as brake dust adachi and tainosho 2004 investigations on properties of twp have used material generated in one of the following ways i by real on road driving conditions using mobile units hussein et al 2008 kwak et al 2013 mathissen et al 2011 under controlled conditions where the contribution from existing road dust and minerals from the road surface present under ambient conditions is considered kumar et al 2013 wang et al 2017b ii by sampling and analysis of particles from ambient air followed by application either of source apportionment methods bukowiecki et al 2009 luhana et al 2004 or specific tire wear tracers harrison et al 2012 panko et al 2013a or iii by a road simulator in the laboratory dahl et al 2006 gustafsson et al 2008 kreider et al 2010 kupiainen et al 2005 panko et al 2009 iv alternatively twp may be generated in the laboratory using a steel brush grit paper or other abrasive media which are however not able to replicate driving conditions kreider et al 2010 the shape of twp generated on road was therefore found to be very different from that of cryogenically ground tire material which has sharper more defined edges figs 1 and 2 thus twp at the road surface and in the environment are mostly not present as pristine material and it is likely that these multicomponent twp will differ in physical and chemical properties from the original tire material table 2 it appears that knowledge on how particle generation and particle properties are connected is insufficient for example no information is available on the densities of twp these knowledge gaps obviously hamper a comprehensive prediction of the fate of these particle entities in aquatic environment 2 2 2 physical properties the size distribution and density of particles are important parameters that determine their fate in the environment abrasion of tire tread leads to the emission of twp that can be classified into coarse pm10 fine pm2 5 and ultrafine pm0 1 particles fig 1 while twp are mainly found in the coarse size fraction only 0 1 10 are estimated to become airborne pm10 and below barlow et al 2007 boulter et al 2006 panko et al 2013a wik and dave 2006 ultrafine particles are generated by a thermo mechanical process spots on the tire surface reach temperatures high enough for the evaporation of volatile tire constituents which rapidly condense and form microparticles mathissen et al 2011 despite the fact that the majority of particles emitted during wear are in the coarse fraction the research with regard to the characterization of twp size distribution has focused on airborne pm10 and pm2 5 the size distribution of twp ranges from a few nanometers to several hundred micrometers fig 1 kreider et al 2010 tested different types of tires on asphalt based pavements in a road simulator and found that the size distribution of collected twp ranged between 5 0 μm and 220 μm with a maximum abundance at 70 80 μm kreider et al 2010 there was no pm0 1 found under controlled driving conditions similar observations were made by smolders and degryse 2002 who found roadside twp with a mean diameter of 65 μm for passenger vehicles and 80 μm for trucks however a number of studies report bimodal mass size distributions with one peak in the coarse fraction and another one in the fine fraction fukahori and yamazaki 1994 gustafsson et al 2008 wang et al 2017b these discrepancies in the obtained particle size distributions can result from different conditions of particle formation in sampling and in analytical instrumentation used kreider et al 2010 which hampers the comparisons of available data for a bimodal size distribution of twp small particles pm10 originated from microvibration and larger particles in the range of a few hundred micrometers were attributed to stick slip motion fukahori and yamazaki 1994 the speed of driving and the pavement material were reported to influence the amount of particles emitted rather than their size distribution gustafsson et al 2008 kwak et al 2013 ultrafine twp have very heterogenic forms such as droplets fibers and granules these particles form agglomerates dahl et al 2006 contrary to coarser particles the ultrafine twp seem to originate from organic constituents of tires softening filler and specifically mineral oils gustafsson et al 2008 most of the particles within the fine fraction are composed mainly of carbon panko et al 2009 further studies indicated fig 2 that fine twp are elongated in shape and contain incrustations of minerals from the road surface the morphology of twp was reported as an elongated sausage like shape with a mode of circularity of 0 83 and an aspect ratio of 0 64 adachi and tainosho 2004 cadle and williams 1978 kreider et al 2010 williams and cadle 1978 other factors influencing the generation of twp are the pavement properties its composition and texture for example the pm10 concentration has been shown to increase when anti skid aggregates were used in the asphalt pavements tervahattu et al 2006 and also the pm2 5 and pm0 1 concentrations were influenced by differences in the asphalt mixtures fullova and ďurcasnka 2016 in addition twp size distribution and concentration are influenced by the adhesion mechanism of friction for which surface energy and wear pattern of the tire are of major importance vieira et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2 2 3 chemical composition depending on their formation processes twp exhibit a chemical composition that differs from the composition of the initial tire material similar to the size characterization there is more information available on the chemical composition of airborne fine twp than on coarse ones pm10 the chemical composition of twp seems to differ depending on the size range considered for example in the coarse fraction of particles the concentrations of fe ca and zn were found to be high compared to concentrations of ti and sb kwak et al 2013 in the fine fraction of particles the concentrations of fe ca ti ba and sb dominated but zn was not found kwak et al 2013 and al and si dominated in the smaller sized airborne wear particles gustafsson et al 2008 kupiainen et al 2005 panko et al 2009 sulfur was reported to be enriched in the sub micrometer fraction particularly when friction tires were tested gustafsson et al 2008 panko et al 2009 the zn contribution to the total particle mass was similar 0 3 0 4 for road collected and laboratory generated wear particles kreider et al 2010 but different between passenger vehicles 1 1 and trucks 2 4 smolders and degryse 2002 the carbonaceous fraction of twp is dominated by organic substances 88 with trace amounts of elemental carbon 4 and carbonate carbon 8 the pah composition of coarse twp and the concentrations of individual pahs varied from the mg kg range for pyrene phenanthrene and fluoranthene to not detectable concentrations of these pahs in road wear particles aatmeeyata and sharma 2010 rogge et al 1993 other sources such as asphalt automobile exhaust and fuel combustion products are often more dominant pah contributors kreider et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 the pah content of twp increased with increasing mileage of the tire aatmeeyata and sharma 2010 due to thermal degradation of tires kwon and castaldi 2012 benzothiazoles are another substance class commonly found in twp a large variety of other organic compounds have been identified in twp such as n alkanes n alkanoic acids and natural resins rogge et al 1993 2 2 4 emission of twp from automobile traffic the quantity of twp emissions is often related to the mileage the so called emission factor defines the amount of twp generated per kilometer driving distance mg km this emission factor is controlled by i tire characteristics e g size width chemical composition accumulated mileage ii vehicle characteristics e g weight engine power state of maintenance iii road surface characteristics e g material bitumen concrete texture pattern wetness temperature van der gon et al 2013 and iv vehicle operation and operation conditions e g speed linear acceleration radial acceleration extent of braking and cornering boulter et al 2006 accordingly the reported abrasion rates cover a wide range heavy duty vehicles such as trailer trucks have been reported to emit approximately ten times more twp than light duty vehicles and passenger cars for instance median twp emission factors have been reported for passenger cars with 90 mg km 53 200 mg km for trucks with 700 mg km 105 1700 mg km and for trailer trucks with 1200 mg km 1000 1500 mg km hillenbrand et al 2005 for passenger cars this agrees well to the average of data collected by councell et al 2004 with 112 mg km 16 data points and a standard deviation of 174 mg km the scatter in the experimental data may reflect the different experimental conditions laboratory or field and methods of determination tire mass loss or direct measurement absolute twp emissions at the regional scale have been calculated either based on emission factors and annual travel distances of various vehicle categories or from average weight loss of tires and the number of tires in use for germany twp emissions for 2005 were estimated based on emission factors to be 111 42 103 t a hillenbrand et al 2005 a recent review calculated population specific twp emissions for various countries including china india japan norway sweden denmark and the united states of america usa kole et al 2017 data ranged between 0 23 and 1 9 kg a capita in the investigated countries in the usa however significantly higher emission of 4 7 kg a capita were found because of longer travel distances per capita kole et al 2017 a new estimation of the quantity of twp emissions was performed here for germany the european union eu and the usa for different vehicles categories and for urban and rural roads table 3 these considerations are important for the identification and localization of most relevant sources for example trucks on highways twp emissions in germany and the usa were calculated based on average emission factors provided by hillenbrand et al 2005 and recent data on total travel distance on highways and urban roads for various vehicle categories including passenger cars trucks busses and trailer trucks bäumer et al 2017 our estimation of twp emissions in the eu is based on car registration data and average traveled distances for each vehicle category based on this data we estimate that 133 103 t a twp were released in 2014 in germany table 3 this exceeds the amount estimated for 2005 by 20 see above emissions were dominated by trucks and busses 60 largest distances in germany are traveled on highways and rural roads with 550 109 km followed by urban areas with 190 109 km table 3 accordingly 70 of the twp emissions are likely generated on highways and rural roads and 30 in cities table 3 according to our estimation using data from 2010 in the usa twp emissions from passenger cars and trucks are of equal importance and sum up to 1120 103 t a table 3 a portion of 66 of these emissions occurs in urban environments compared to less than 30 in germany this difference is primarily due to the much higher urban travel distances in the usa table 3 which have been reported earlier councell et al 2004 this estimate of twp emissions for the usa are higher than earlier ones due to an increase in automobile traffic pierson and brachaczek 1974 estimated 600 103 t a of tire wear for the usa in 1974 a more recent publication by councell et al 2004 estimated zn emissions in the usa originating from twp in 1999 from this data twp emissions were deduced to be between 900 103 t a and 1000 103 t a assuming tire wear contains 1 1 wt zn smolders and degryse 2002 in the eu the total number of registered passenger cars and trucks was 210 106 and 36 106 respectively eu 2016 eurostat 2017 in 2014 the average distance traveled in the eu was approximated from average distances traveled in germany for passenger cars trucks and busses it is noted that average travel distance of trucks in germany might be higher compared to the eu average because of the high proportion of transit traffic in germany in total 260 103 t a twp are estimated to be emitted by passenger cars and 1100 103 t a twp by trucks including busses these emissions could not be further attributed to highway rural and urban roads due to the lack of data on the respective travel distances while engine exhaust emissions have decreased continuously during the last decades as a result of technical improvements the non exhaust emission remained constant or increased with rising traffic van der gon et al 2013 this global development is expected to continue due to a growth of automobile traffic goonetilleke et al 2017 leading to an increase in twp emissions the differentiation between vehicle categories makes clear that passenger cars and trucks emit almost equal percentage of twp in germany and the usa in germany twp emissions occur predominantly on highways whereas in the usa urban roads are more important table 3 in order to assess the environmental importance of twp emissions one may compare them with other non exhaust traffic emissions comprising of brake wear road wear and tire wear total traffic related emissions are composed of approximately 5 30 tire wear harrison et al 2012 due to complex generation processes the individual share of non exhaust emission components varies for instance studded tires exhibit much higher road surface erosion rates than non studded tires gültlinger et al 2014 lindbom et al 2007 the vehicle category plays another important role for medium sized cars for example road wear dominates non exhaust emissions and twp mass fraction equals approximately 30 of the total non exhaust emissions simons 2016 fig 3 twp emissions may also be compared with the emission of other classes of xenobiotic compounds for germany the estimated twp emission of 133 103 t a table 3 is four times the amount of active substances of pesticides used and released into the environment per year approx 33 103 t a in 2016 bvl 2017 and 16 times the amount of environmentally relevant human pharmaceuticals 8 1 103 t a in 2012 ebert et al 2014 however pesticides and pharmaceuticals are emitted in dissolved form while twp are released as particles with respect to the aquatic environment however it would be important to know which portion of the emitted twp ultimately ends up in surface waters this is controlled by the environmental fate of twp 3 analytical methods to determine the amount of twp in the environment this section focuses on methods suitable for the determination of the amount of twp in environmental samples such as dust sediments soil or water neither does it consider methods for the analysis of tire constituents directly from tires nor methods for the determination of tire born dissolved compounds in the aqueous phase after their release from tires the determination of the amount of twp in environmental samples requires an increase in sensitivity and selectivity with increasing distance between the source of twp emission and the sampling site the concentration of twp is expected to decrease with this distance while the complexity of the matrix and the importance of other sources increase for these reasons analytical methods developed for tire analysis are usually not suitable for the determination of twp from environmental samples also methods to determine tire particles in road dust with higher twp contributions may not work for roadside soils with a lower portion of twp analytical strategies to determine the amount of twp in environmental samples involve the determination of either the rubber sbr or nr as the major constituent of tires or of additives from the tire material that serve as markers for tires a marker should ideally fulfill the following criteria be present in all tire materials in comparable portion largely independent from manufacturer or manufacturing process not leach easily from tire particles into the surrounding environment not be easily transformed while the tire particles reside in the environment air water soil be sufficiently specific for tires namely not present in relevant concentration in other traffic related particulate matter such as brake dust roadway particles or surface runoff have a concentration in tire material significantly higher than in the particles forming the sample matrix soil sediment road dust suspended matter aerosol be analytically accessible by methods of high precision accuracy and sensitivity at reasonable analytical effort markers may either be metals or organic compounds the major elements considered as markers for twp are zn used as activator in the vulcanization process and s originating from various reduced organic sulfur species that are used as vulcanization accelerators rogge et al 1993 a variety of organic marker constituents have also been tested as discussed in more detail below 3 1 detection of twp particles from dust and water the detection of individual twp is of interest when particulate matter has been collected on filters e g by aerosol sampling with impactors for the detection of twp on filters spatially resolved analytical methods have been employed spectroscopic methods like raman spectroscopy however cannot be used as the black twp do not deliver a specific spectrum instead the determination of marker elements may help for example energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edxs has been used to detect twp in dust collected in the laboratory environment using its s and zn signature adachi and tainosho 2004 camatini et al 2001 fig 4 the authors noted however that this approach was not selective enough to identify tire particles in road dust collected from the environment as there are many other sources for zn like brake dust and paint used for road marking obviously these approaches are limited to situations where the contribution of twp to the particulate fraction of samples is comparatively large moreover the suitability of these methods for quantitative analyses remains questionable in principle twp detection by spatially resolved analysis of filters should also be suitable for the detection of twp in water samples after filtration however this application has not been reported yet 3 2 sediments and soils for more complex particulate samples or more diluted conditions the detection of each single twp is not feasible any longer then elemental analysis may be used to determine the total quantity of twp mass from sample digests complete digestion of tire material is however challenging often particulate matter remains in the digest this is not critical provided that only the sio2 filler remains otherwise it may lead to an underestimation of the true value strong acids nitric acid sulfuric acid perchloric acid elevated temperature 100 c and digestion times of several hours are therefore used kocher et al 2010 smolders and degryse 2002 metal determination in the diluted digest may involve aas icp oes kocher et al 2010 smolders and degryse 2002 or icp ms depending on the sensitivity required and the number of elements to be detected although some elements namely al na and fe exhibit higher concentrations than zn in tires they are not suited as elemental markers for twp as their environmental concentrations e g in soil are typically even higher kocher et al 2010 rhodes et al 2012 studied the loss of zn from tire particles some leaching of zn occurred but the zn content of the tire particles was not significantly reduced thus leaching did not limit the use of zn as marker of twp as mentioned above there are other traffic related sources that emit particulate zn moreover particulate zn may be formed in the aqueous phase in urban environments by adsorption or precipitation of dissolved zn2 ions that are discharged with surface runoff and originate from gutterings facades road signs and other surfaces plated with zn councell et al 2004 this further limits the specificity of particulate zn as tire marker in samples that are influenced by surface runoff such as from sewers urban creeks and receiving waters to increase selectivity fauser et al 1999 proposed not to determine the total zn content of particulate samples but more specifically the zinc accelerator complexes organic zinc as marker of twp the analytical approach first involves the extraction of the organo zn complexes from particulate matter by dichloromethane followed by digestion of the organic extract with nitric acid and determination of total zn in the digest fauser et al 1999 unfortunately there may be other traffic related sources of organo zinc such as engine oil fauser et al 1999 additionally unice et al 2013 pointed out that the solvent dichloromethane does not reliably exclude inorganic zno from extraction both aspects would lead to an overestimation of the content of twp in environmental samples and question the suitability of organo zinc as tire marker rubber is the major component and the backbone of tires therefore it seems straightforward to determine the amount of rubber if one is interested in the amount of twp in a sample however rubber is a polymer of high molecular weight which is not amenable as such to chemical analysis therefore rubber determination involves destructive measures that generate rubber specific volatile breakdown products typically by pyrolysis where the sample is heated to temperatures of 600 800 c for a few seconds the volatile products are transferred to and analyzed by gas chromatography either by gc fid or by gc ms unice et al 2012 the markers generated by rubber pyrolysis and determined by gc are styrene for sbr lee et al 1989 saito 1989 unice et al 2012 and isoprene or dipentene 1 methyl 4 isopropylcyclohexene for nr lee et al 1989 saito 1989 unice et al 2012 fig 5 some authors also included vinylcyclohexene and butadiene as sbr markers cadle and williams 1980 unice et al 2012 usually py gc is applied to the entire particulate sample to increase sensitivity the rubber of a sample can first be extracted and then only the extract is subjected to py gc rubber is however not easily brought into solution so that comparatively harsh extraction conditions have to be used cadle and williams 1980 py gc ms suffers from limited precision to improve this unice et al 2012 have added defined amounts of an internal standard material to the sample that generates a deuterated volatile monomer deuterated poly butadiene or poly isoprene which can be analyzed together with the rubber markers unice et al 2012 py gc ms methods were typically applied to road dust lee et al 1989 panko et al 2013a saito 1989 and to soils unice et al 2012 the most recent studies reached method detection limits of 2 30 μg g in soil depending on the kind of rubber unice et al 2012 and 300 800 μg g from 1 mg of dust collected on a filter panko et al 2013a many organic compounds are added during rubber and tire manufacturing see section 2 most of them are however not suited as markers because they are not specific for tires but have also other traffic related sources for example pahs and aliphatic hydrocarbons are present in tires but they are also found in asphalt automobile exhausts and fuel combustion products kreider et al 2010 one class of chemicals that have been used as markers of twp are benzothiazoles fig 6 2 4 morpholinyl benzothiazole 24mobt from the vulcanization accelerator obs and n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazolamine ncba from the accelerator cbs which contains mainly n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazolesulfenamide kumata et al 2002 spies et al 1987 cbs is the more frequently used vulcanization accelerator kumata et al 2002 and was claimed to be also the more environmentally friendly one pan et al 2012 during the vulcanization process however these vulcanization accelerators are transformed to a large extent less than 1 of cbs was found to survive the curing of rubber unice et al 2015 owing to the tight structure of rubber the extraction of organic constituents from tire material requires comparatively harsh conditions obviously such harsh conditions are also required to extract tire markers from environmental samples provided that they are still fixed in the rubber matrix as they should be most extraction methods involve soxhlet extraction using solvent mixtures such as benzene methanol 6 4 v v kumata et al 1996 toluene methanol 1 1 v v kumata et al 2000 or dichloromethane acetone 1 1 v v ni et al 2008 to date accelerated solvent extraction ase may be applicable instead but this would need to be validated while a clean up may not be required for extracts of tire material itself this becomes increasingly important with increasing distance from the emission source as the concentration of tire particles decreases while the portion of sample matrix increases moreover the harsh extraction conditions further increase the matrix content in an extract clean up procedures for benzothiazole analysis involved partitioning between an organic and an aqueous phase making use of the acid base properties of ncba and mobt kumata et al 2000 and column clean up with deactivated silica kumata et al 1996 or alumina silica mixes 1 2 in volume ni et al 2008 the instrumentation that has been used for the determination of the benzothiazole marker compounds in sample extracts reflects the general development in analytical instrumentation with gc based methods used initially first with gc fpd selective for sulfur kumata et al 2002 1996 then with gc ms ni et al 2008 and from the 2000s onwards complemented by lc ms avagyan et al 2013 kloepfer et al 2004 reemtsma 2000 the benzothiazole marker compounds 24mobt and ncba clearly show the challenges related to the use of organic markers for tires in a heterogeneous environment only a low portion of the cbs accelerator added to rubber before curing is found afterwards as ncba while other benzothiazoles namely mercapto benzothiazole mbt and also cyclohexylamine were more relevant unice et al 2015 indeed many other benzothiazoles are present in tire rubber like benzothiazole itself the mbt and its methylation product methylthiobenzothiazole mtbt as well as the oxidation product mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide mbts avagyan et al 2013 due to their lower molecular weight and a higher polarity these transformation products are preferentially leached from tire particles which makes them unsuited as alternate markers for tire particles unice et al 2015 benzothiazoles found in the aqueous phase may also have other sources kloepfer et al 2005 and are subjected to transformation processes reemtsma et al 1995 thus it is not fully clear yet to which extent the two benzothiazoles ncba and mobt are reliable tire markers two other compounds were therefore tested for their suitability as tire markers the vulcanization agent 1 3 diphenylguanidine dpg and the antioxidant n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl 1 4 phenylenediamine 6 ppd fig 6 both were more stable than the benzothiazoles during curing with approximately 50 loss dpg is partially transformed into the water soluble and easily leachable aniline unice et al 2015 4 aminodiphenylamine was found as degradation product of the antioxidant 6 ppd but the number of possible transformation products was much larger unice et al 2015 6 ppd is also less prone to leaching as it is comparatively hydrophobic logkow 4 unice et al 2015 while the antioxidant 6 ppd is also reported to be used in lubricants and dyes prosser et al 2017 its major application is in elastomers krüger et al 2005 on this basis one may consider 6 ppd an interesting candidate as marker for twp that deserves more scientific scrutiny resin acids namely dehydroabietic acid dha are added during rubber manufacturing as emulsifiers rogge et al 1993 and have recently been proposed as an alternative marker for twp kumata et al 2011 resin acids such as dha do have however many natural sources in biogeochemistry for example resin acids are considered biomarkers for the input from conifers medeiros and simoneit 2008 elevated levels of dha in the environment have also been related to discharges from pulp and paper production leppänen and oikari 1999 questioning the specificity of dha as marker it appears that satisfactory analytical approaches to determine the amount of twp in environmental samples are not readily available the analytical challenges increase with increasing distance from a source of emission while benzothiazoles have been proposed as markers they cannot fulfill many of the criteria needed 6 ppd appears an interesting but yet poorly studied alternative another option is to improve methods for the determination of rubber as such rather than searching for novel markers 4 occurrence and behavior of twp in the aquatic environment 4 1 role of particulate twp mass flow the concentration of twp in soil or water is determined by transport into these environmental compartments translocation transformation and degradation within these compartments as well as by transport out of these compartments the predominant portion of twp is coarse 10 μm and is assumed to remain at the road side cadle and williams 1979 dannis 1974 once generated and deposited twp are subjected to interaction with other traffic related particles from brakes tire pavement street furniture as well as with atmospheric deposition which results in the formation of aggregates charters et al 2015 this makes it difficult to distinguish between individual particle types sources adachi and tainosho 2004 hence most of the studies on traffic related particles were based on the so called total non exhaust traffic related particle emission or road deposited sediments consequently there is insufficient information specifically on the occurrence and behavior of twp depending on their size twp and their aggregates are eventually transported off the street by surface runoff by street cleaning or transferred into the atmosphere by resuspension huber et al 2016 wicke et al 2012 mobilization of twp by road runoff may lead to a translocation especially during stormwater events aryal et al 2010 the translocation of twp by rainfall strongly depends on the infrastructure installed for the collection and treatment of road runoff water in case there is no runoff sewer installed twp are likely quantitatively transferred to the roadside soil and to some extent to the nearest waterway if road runoff is collected in separate sewer systems a runoff treatment is usually foreseen before the water is discharged into receiving waters or percolated into groundwater barbosa et al 2012 in the centers of urban areas of industrialized countries surface runoff is often collected in sewers combined with municipal wastewater and treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants although no data on twp removal in wastewater treatment plants are available data on microplastics removal may allow a rough estimate removals exceeding 96 have been reported for microplastic in municipal wastewater treatment plants magnusson and norén 2014 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 but small particles are less efficiently removed compared to larger ones 300 μm kole et al 2017 on this basis one may expect removal efficiencies above 90 for twp 300 μm and lower removal for twp 300 μm in municipal wastewater treatment plants in the case of strong rainfall events however combined sewer overflow may occur and the wastewater be discharged into surface waters without any treatment reemtsma et al 2000 the majority of treatment of road runoff collected in separate sewer systems are based on filtration or sedimentation aryal et al 2010 their efficiency is strongly depending on the treatment process and on the properties of the particulate material hallberg et al 2007 jotte et al 2017 the runoff waters are typically characterized by high total suspended solid and high metal concentration as well as a bimodal particle size distribution with maxima between 6 10 μm and 70 100 μm brombach et al 2005 charters et al 2016 huber et al 2016 the mass percentage of particle sizes 63 μm so called fine sediments varies between 17 wt and 100 wt charters et al 2015 a survey on treatment systems revealed that removal efficiencies increase with increasing particle size and increasing hydraulic retention time for metals partitioned in the fine sediment fraction 63 μm retention in settling ponds is unlikely charters et al 2015 hilliges et al 2017 and removal efficiency is typically below 50 boogaard et al 2017 leading to metal emissions of zn and ni for instance gill et al 2017 reported average removal efficiencies of 86 for zn in a wetland with long hydraulic retention times gill et al 2017 whereas fettig et al 2017 showed that lamella sedimentation systems removed only 21 of particulate zn fettig et al 2017 therefore twp might not be efficiently removed in runoff treatment systems that are based on sedimentation with only short hydraulic retention times under high hydraulic loads removal rates of twp are expected to decline in sedimentation ponds and twp can be flushed out gill et al 2017 it has been observed that during stormwater events twp concentrations increased in the receiving water body kumata et al 2000 rural roads are mostly not equipped with a sewer and road runoff is treated only passively by percolation data on coverage of runoff treatment systems is not available therefore it is not possible to estimate the global amounts of twp that reach aquatic environments such estimation can be performed only on the local scale if adequate information is available for example twp concentrations were determined locally in road runoff ni et al 2008 unice et al 2013 wik and dave 2009 environmental twp concentrations were estimated based on marker concentrations because analytical methods for the reliable determination of twp concentrations in the environment are not available see section 4 such estimated data are available for road dust road surfaces soils in the close vicinity of the road road runoff settling ponds wastewater effluent river sediments and air fig 7 as one may expect twp concentrations appear to decrease with increased distance from the road highest concentrations were detected in tunnels and soils next to the road fig 7 towards the receiving water body twp concentration decreases because particles are being retained already at the road side and due to dilution contamination of groundwater by twp transported through the unsaturated soil zone is unlikely however groundwater contamination may occur by dissolved twp constituents that were leached from twp at the soil surface padoan et al 2017 twp concentrations in sediment are higher than those in surface water fig 7 because particles settle down and accumulate in the sediments correspondingly not only sediments in runoff treatment ponds but also sediments in the receiving water body act as a sink for twp fig 7 thus the question arises under which conditions twp accumulate in the sediment in principle the finer fraction of twp is expected to be easily transported during runoff while the coarser particles are more effectively retained because they settle in drainage channels canals and gully pots loganathan et al 2013 occurrence and characterization i e particle size distributions and chemical composition of road deposited sediments and other sum parameters for example total suspended solids have been studied in a number of case studies throughout the world sutherland et al 2012 wang et al 2017b zhou et al 2017 research focusing explicitly on twp specific properties and the processes affecting the fate of twp such as aggregation sedimentation or aging are still lacking in order to link twp emission environmental concentration and effects in various compartments it is crucial to understand the processes controlling the mass flow of twp from their source to surface waters and to determine the mass flows from sources to surface water in this review the yearly mass of twp entering water bodies is estimated for german highways twp emission from highways is estimated with 48 x 103 t a table 3 a portion of 10 of this is emitted into the atmosphere while the remaining mass is deposited on the road or at the road side the amount being retained and the amount reaching the receiving water body depends on the collection and treatment infrastructure two scenarios are calculated assuming that a 50 of the deposited twp are mobilized via surface runoff kaufmann et al 2007 and b that only 15 are mobilized hillenbrand et al 2005 the remaining twp accumulate at the road side in both scenarios it is assumed that all surface runoff is treated prior to full discharge into the receiving water body with no infiltration into the soil and that the average treatment efficiency is 50 twp removal fig 8 illustrates the mass flows of twp for both scenarios the mass of twp from highways estimated to reach the receiving german water body ranges from 3000 t a scenario b to 11 000 t a scenario a corresponding to 6 and 23 of the total twp emission respectively kole et al 2017 estimated twp release in the aquatic environment with approximately 7 of the total twp emission in the netherlands which is similar to the estimation in scenario a in case no treatment systems are in place twp outflow into the aquatic environment increases to 13 and 45 of the total emitted twp for scenarios a and b respectively these estimations are solely based on assumptions and need to be verified by field data however the results underline the importance of road and roadside management as well as the possible efficiency of runoff treatment systems regarding the prevention of twp release into the aquatic environment once emitted into surface waters twp will distribute further literature data on twp concentrations in rivers and sediments fig 7 suggest that sedimentation is an important process that removes twp from the surface waters correspondingly twp concentrations of 400 2200 μg g in river sediments have been determined ni et al 2008 unice et al 2013 wik and dave 2009 4 1 1 twp relevant fate processes at their point of emission on road surfaces twp may aggregate with other twp homoaggregation or other particles heteroaggregation with increasing distance from the road homoaggregation is likely to be negligible due to the decreasing twp concentration fig 7 compared to the concentrations of other particles heteroaggregation with suspended particulate matter is strongly influenced by particle sizes and densities therezien et al 2014 while particle size distributions of twp and their aggregates have been reported see section 2 2 other important physical properties such as twp density or surface charge have not been reported yet one may assume that twp density depends upon their composition while carbon black has a density of 1 8 g cm3 the density of sbr ranges from 0 94 to 1 04 g cm3 depending on its styrene portion sigma aldrich 2013 2012a 2012b the density of shredded tire materials has been reported to range between 1 13 and 1 16 g cm3 rhodes et al 2012 the lower densities of twp compared to other road derived particles e g asphalt 2 36 g cm3 rumble 2017 or suspended particulate matter e g quartz 2 65 or limestone 2 0 g cm3 rumble 2017 lead to the assumption that pure twp have a high potential to remain in suspension and be transported over longer distances while twp heteroaggregates with a higher density would be subjected to sedimentation this illustrates the need to investigate aggregation processes of twp in more detail as found for other particulate matter such as nanoparticles and microplastics one may assume that heteroaggregation is dependent on the surface characteristics of the twp and thus also affected by the characteristics of the surrounding water e g its ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter besseling et al 2017 praetorius et al 2014 smith et al 2015 furthermore aging processes may change the properties of twp in the aquatic environment these processes may involve mechanical stress oxidation as long as twp are not deposited in sediments as well as microbial colonization and degradation considering the major components of twp rubber and carbon black it can be expected that twp in the aquatic environment are persistent and degrade only slowly the available data do not allow to conclude on twp mass flows in the aquatic environment beyond those shown in fig 8 reliable information and data on infrastructure to collect and treat road runoff on the dynamics of twp transport e g mobilization during stormwater events as well as treatment efficiency for particles 50 μm would be required to estimate environmental concentrations of twp more precisely furthermore experimental or model based studies on the fate processes of twp are needed the latter could be achieved similar to the development of nanoparticle models first simple mass flow models evolved into validated spatiotemporal explicit models gottschalk et al 2013 for other particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials or microplastics complex transport models were developed besseling et al 2017 domercq et al 2018 praetorius et al 2014 these models simulate explicit spatial and temporal hydrodynamic particle behavior and account for advective transport particle aggregation sedimentation and resuspension such modeling approaches could be adapted for twp in smaller and larger size ranges this would be necessary to allow the identification of relevant fate processes and potential mitigation strategies 4 1 2 compounds released from twp the quality of the aquatic environment may be affected by the introduction of twp as particulate entities however also compounds released from twp and transferred into the aqueous phase may affect water quality the leaching from twp exposed to water has been investigated for a wide spectrum of substances including heavy metals such as zn smolders and degryse 2002 cu cd cr and pb malmstrom 1956 and organics such as pahs and benzothiazoles reddy and quinn 1997 wik and dave 2009 leaching from tire materials has been investigated in laboratory leaching studies e g tire crumb or tire wear the experimental conditions strongly affect the outcome of the experiment for example the removal of the metal wires from crumb rubbers minimized leaching of fe and manganese selbes et al 2015 the influence of the particle size on leaching from twp is inconclusive as organic carbon and zn were found to be leached more effectively from smaller particle sizes whereas the leaching of some elements were found to be independent from particles sizes of tire crumb rubber rhodes et al 2012 for zn it has been shown that leaching was reduced with both increasing salinity and ph of the leaching solution degaffe and turner 2011 on the contrary no effect of ph was observed for leaching of na and s from tire materials selbes et al 2015 for other compounds however systematic studies on the effect of the composition of the leaching solution its ionic strength e g mono divalent cations or natural organic matter on the extent of leaching are missing and should be included in future research a mechanistic interpretation of leaching results would require knowledge on the chemical speciation in the twp matrix as well as on the factors and constraints governing their dissolution this information is missing in many cases as the organic and inorganic species present in tire material vary among tire models and may be altered in the production process as well as during tire use for example zn accelerators inconsistent results have been obtained regarding the influence of physico chemical properties methodological parameters sampling analytics hydrochemical conditions ph ionic strength on leaching degaffe and turner 2011 rhodes et al 2012 selbes et al 2015 thus experimental parameters should be described in detail for each study to allow a comparison of the results obtained the leaching of pahs from tires was either investigated using samples obtained by artificial abrasion of the tire using files or knifes etc aatmeeyata and sharma 2010 sadiktsis et al 2012 or by sampling traffic related particles boonyatumanond et al 2007 rogge et al 1993 takada et al 1990 with highly variable results therefore the use of shredded tires is not recommended it should be taken into account that most substances leaching from twp may also have other sources such other sources are other traffic related particles or traffic area runoff including wear of brakes vehicle components pavement materials road equipment and road maintenance activities dongarra et al 2007 hjortenkrans et al 2007 johansson et al 2009 moreno et al 2006 querol et al 2007 shah et al 2006 other contributions may stem from point sources such as steel plants and other industrial activities in cities espinosa et al 2004 querol et al 2007 shah et al 2006 and corrosion of metallic material alongside streets it has been estimated that e g the largest portion of zn in stormwater runoff originates from building materials 70 rather than from twp and that most pah stem from atmospheric deposition 40 petrucci et al 2014 a detailed apportionment of the contribution of dissolved compounds from twp is necessary to assess whether aside from potential risks connected to the particulate twp themselves twp act as a significant source of dissolved compounds for receiving waters 5 effects on biota in the aquatic environment effects on biota can be caused by physical interactions between particle and organism often related to particle size and shape and or by toxic compounds released from the particles skjolding et al 2016 the majority of studies examined effects of twp leachates independent from the environmental compartment only a few studies considered different environmental compartments e g surface water sediments and soil table 4 most investigations focused on airborne twp which is reflected by the high number of available publications gustafsson et al 2008 mantecca et al 2010 2009 in order to study toxicity of twp in the aquatic environment leaching tests in aquatic media in the absence of soil and sediment were conducted after leaching the twp were removed and only the leachate was used for toxicity testing toxicity of twp leachates was related to the presence of zn other toxic metals like pb and cd as well as organic compounds like benzothiazole derivatives phthalates phenolic derivatives hydrocarbons aromatic amines and resin acids wik and dave 2009 in fact several studies found zn and organic compounds to be among the most important leachable tire constituents turner and rice 2010 wik et al 2009 treatment of leachates with ion exchange columns or spe columns led to significantly reduced toxicity indicating that not only metals are responsible for toxicity but also lipophilic organic compounds wik et al 2009 pahs bound to tires are not easily extracted even under harsh extraction conditions the bioavailability of pahs from twp to organisms in the environment is expected to be low kreider et al 2010 the acute effect concentrations of twp in aquatic media including marine environments were found to cover a range of 25 100 000 mg twp l while chronic effect concentrations vary from 10 to 3600 mg twp l varying test designs tire materials and species sensitivity might be responsible for a high variability of leachate toxicity data turner and rice 2010 wik and dave 2009 it was shown that twp leachates have sublethal effects i e teratogenic mutagenic and estrogenic effects the twp concentrations at which these sublethal effects were shown ranged between an equivalent of 500 mg twp l and 500 000 mg twp l wik and dave 2009 these twp concentrations in water do not represent realistic environmental conditions even a dilution to 1 would represent extremely contaminated water equivalent to 500 mg twp l reported environmental concentrations in river water and settling ponds do not exceed 10 mg twp l fig 7 only in surface runoff twp concentrations 100 mg l have been reported as reported earlier twp from road simulators are not appropriate to study ecotoxicological effects because they behave differently compared to real twp kreider et al 2010 twp toxicity in soils and sediments is most probably linked to leaching of toxic constituents panko et al 2013b twp from a road simulator were mixed with sediment and the leachate was not acutely toxic under environmental relevant conditions temperature and twp concentration marwood et al 2011 panko et al 2013b conclusively the risk of leachate toxicity resulting from twp in sediments is low since observed effects were low or absent at twp concentrations of up to 10 000 mg twp kg sediment panko et al 2013b in order to study chronic toxicity of twp in sediments the accumulation of leached zn from weathered twp by amphibians rana sylvatica during larval development was analyzed and compared to zncl2 spiked soils zn was shown to be bioavailable from twp and zncl2 there were no significant differences in effects between both sublethal effects were observed however increased mortality of larvae could not be observed at a statistically significant level and an impact on amphibian survival in traffic influenced environments cannot be expected from the presence of twp camponelli et al 2009 to assess the risk of twp in the aquatic environment two requirements have to be fulfilled environmental exposure conditions e g twp concentration have to be known and test conditions have to be selected keeping environmental conditions in mind from the reviewed studies however it can be concluded that effects vary due to inconsistent experimental conditions and the heterogeneous nature of twp composition further the applied test conditions differed strongly from environmental conditions as either twp concentrations were well above expected environmental concentrations or the leaching conditions were harsher than in the environment these test results are therefore hardly suitable for an environmental risk assessment of twp 6 conclusions based on this review the following conclusions can be drawn twp are a mixture of tire wear and particulate matter from the pavement or road dust the share of twp of non exhaust emissions from traffic was estimated to 5 30 the amount of twp generated in germany 2014 the european union 2014 and the usa 2010 were re estimated as 0 13 106 t a 1 3 106 t a and 1 1 106 t a the infrastructure for collection of surface runoff and the conditions of its treatment determine how much of the released twp eventually reaches surface water estimates are highly uncertain and vary between 0 1 and 10 of twp emissions for germany between 3000 and 10 000 t a were estimated to reach surface waters concentrations of twp are estimated to range from micrograms per litre in surface water to milligrams per kilogram in sediments suggesting that sediments act as a sink for twp ecotoxicity studies mostly used unrealistically high concentrations and leachates of laboratory produced tire particles rather than real twp direct effects of twp have rarely been studied the following research needs are seen novel twp markers should be found and analytical methods be developed for the determination of twp concentration in various environmental compartments knowledge on physico chemical properties of twp e g particle density particle size distribution in water surface charge should be improved to assess transport and fate of twp in surface waters novel analytical methods should be used to determine the flux of twp and their environmental concentrations an assessment should be made on the mass flows of elements and chemicals related to the twp fluxes in comparison to inputs from other sources ecotoxicity studies should be performed involving real twp and should consider possible direct effects of particles on the basis of improved exposure and effect data the risks related to twp in the aquatic environment should be assessed conflicts of interest we declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was funded in part by the german

19552,this study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes aops in addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by products data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging aops based on electrical energy per order eeo values despite strong variations within reviewed eeo values significant differences could be observed between three groups of aops 1 o3 often considered as aop like process o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine and electron beam represent median eeo values of 1 kwh m3 while median energy consumption by 2 photo fenton plasma and electrolytic aops were significantly higher eeo values in the range of 1 100 kwh m3 3 uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops are characterized by median values of 100 kwh m3 and were therefore considered as not yet energy efficient aops specific evaluation of 147 data points for the uv h2o2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported eeo values besides water type and quality a major influence was observed for process capacity lab vs pilot vs full scale applications and in case of uv based processes of the lamp type however due to the contribution of other factors correlation of eeo values with specific water quality parameters such as uv absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial also correlations between eeo and compound reactivity with oh radicals were not significant photolytically active compounds were not considered based on these findings recommendations regarding the use of the eeo concept including the upscaling of laboratory results were derived graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process trace organic chemicals oxidation by products oh radical

wastewater treatment plant effluents being discharged into surface waters since conventional physical and biological wastewater treatment can only partially remove these substances lim 2008 zhang et al 2008 luo et al 2014 the application of advanced oxidation processes aops provides a viable and effective attenuation option due to the oxidation of a wide range of torcs comninellis et al 2008 klavarioti et al 2009 yang et al 2014 giannakis et al 2015 stefan 2018 according to the definition of bolton et al 1996 and bolton et al 2001 aops are based on the in situ generation of strong oxidants for the oxidation of organic compounds this includes processes based on oh radicals oh which constitute the majority of available aops but also processes based on other oxidizing species favoring sulfate or chlorine radicals there are various different process technologies which have been investigated for use as aops several aops especially those involving ozonation and uv irradiation are already well established and operated at full scale in drinking water treatment and water reuse facilities however new studies of numerous emerging aops for water treatment i e electrochemical aop plasma electron beam ultrasound or microwave based aops are constantly being reported by various researchers stefan 2018 the huge amount of different studies and an increasing number of proposed technologies and process combinations pose an enormous challenge for a critical assessment of aops concerning their operational costs i e energy consumption chemical input sustainability i e resource use carbon footprint and general feasibility e g physical footprint and oxidation by product formation to enable comparison of their efficiency with other aops and alternative treatment processes to address this issue bolton and coworkers developed figures of merit for the comparison of advanced oxidation processes bolton et al 2001 these are based on electrical energy consumption which often represents a major fraction of the aop operating costs for low contaminant concentrations typically 100 mg l the kinetics of destruction of organic contaminants by aops can often be described phenomenologically by simple pseudo first order rate expressions thus the oxidant or energy dosage scales with the volume and treatment goals i e orders of magnitude of reduction per unit volume consequently the figure of merit for electrical driven aops is defined as eeo electrical energy per order electrical energy per order is the electrical energy in kwh required to degrade a contaminant c by one order of magnitude in 1 m 3 of contaminated water bolton et al 1996 this figure of merit has been accepted by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac in 2001 bolton et al 2001 and numerous eeo values have been reported since then in literature for various oxidation processes and applications giving a direct link to the electrical efficiency of the aop this approach allows not only for a simple comparison of different aop technologies but also provides the requisite data for scale up and economic as well as sustainability analyses for comparison with conventional treatment technologies e g activated carbon adsorption air stripping in aqueous systems oxidation of a specific compound c follows a second order reaction where the relative residual concentration is a function of compound specific rate constant koh and the oh exposure accordingly oh exposure can be determined from experimental data using equation 1 1 o h d t ln c c 0 k o h s the oh exposure is controlled by the radical formation efficiency of the respective process as well as competing reactions with other constituents in the water called radical scavenging major radical scavengers are carbonate bicarbonate nitrite and organic matter indicating a strong dependency of compound removal and thus eeo values on the water matrix besides radical scavenging the water matrix might also directly affect the in situ generation of radicals in several processes e g by reducing uv transmittance or reactions with ozone in ozone based aops for these reasons the application of eeo values for a comparison of experimental results from different water matrices is not recommended and comparative studies to evaluate efficiency of different aops in a defined water matrix are needed bolton et al 2001 to date only few studies directly comparing different aops are available bolton et al 1998 müller et al 2001 alaton et al 2002 katsoyiannis et al 2011 ureña de vivanco et al 2013 lutterbeck et al 2015 fast et al 2017 and they are mostly limited to a few established processes to the best of our knowledge such a comprehensive comparison across different aops has not yet been conducted this article provides a critical review of different established and emerging aops based on data compiled during an extensive literature study an initial comparative assessment is conducted based on eeo values reported in the peer reviewed literature for different aops influencing aspects such as reaction rate constants of target substances water matrix process capacity or system parameters are considered and critically evaluated as a result recommendations for the use of the eeo concept in future studies are presented in addition this article also provides an assessment on by product formation in different aops based on reaction mechanisms of different oxidants 2 background regarding advanced oxidation processes for contaminant removal in water technologies for aops involve widely different methods of activation as well as oxidant generation and can potentially utilize a number of different mechanisms for organic destruction an overview of different established and emerging aops is given in fig 1 categorized into ozone based uv based electrochemical eaop catalytic caop and physical paop aops however it is noteworthy that this classification scheme should not be viewed as strict since several processes involve different technologies and thus could be assigned to various categories the different processes summarized in fig 1 represent processes of very different degrees of implementation from well established aops to processes only tested at laboratory scale yet all aops comprise of two steps the in situ formation of reactive oxidative species and the reaction of oxidants with target contaminants mechanisms of radical formation depend on process specific parameters and can be affected by system design and water quality besides radical scavenging also other parameters e g radical mass transfer in surface based aops hydrodynamics play an important role for efficiency of contaminant destruction in the following sections the current status of implementation is reviewed major mechanisms and principles of radical generation are illustrated and constraints of different aops are briefly discussed more comprehensive overview on system design reaction principles and kinetics can be found in various book publications on aops parsons 2004 collins and bolton 2016 stefan 2018 mechanisms for the formation of oxidation by products obps in different aops are discussed separately in section 3 2 1 ozone based aops ozone has long been used as an oxidant and disinfectant in water treatment as an oxidant ozone is very selective and attacks primarily electron rich functional groups like double bonds amines and activated aromatic rings e g phenol since its reactions in real aqueous solutions often involve the formation of oh ozonation itself is often considered an aop or aop like process oh can be formed from the reaction of ozone with hydroxide ions merényi et al 2010a 2010b the initiation of this reaction however is quite slow with a second order rate constant of 70 m 1s 1 in addition radicals are formed as a side product from the reaction of ozone with organic matter mainly phenol and amine functional groups buffle and von gunten 2006 especially during ozonation of secondary effluents these reactions are the major contributors to radical formation methods to actively initiate formation of radicals include the ozonation at elevated ph and the combinations o3 h2o2 also called peroxone process o3 uv and o3 catalysts the combination of ozonation and uv irradiation will be discussed as a uv based aop in section 2 2 2 1 1 ozonation at elevated ph ozonation at elevated ph is considered as an aop if oh generation is intentionally favored elovitz and von gunten 1999 buffle et al 2006 the ph of treated water influences direct ozonation efficiency since dissociated target organic compounds might have significantly different ko3 values calderara et al 2002 furthermore the abundance of hydroxide ions directly influences the oh generation and therefore indirect ozonation especially if the water to be treated has a ph 8 ozonation applied as an aop might be a promising process if the precipitation of calcium carbonate is not of concern 2 1 2 peroxone process o3 h2o2 in the peroxone process ozone reacts with the peroxide anion ho2 to form oh precursors which are subsequently reacting to oh for a detailed mechanistic description of the peroxone process see merényi et al 2010a residual h2o2 might have to be destroyed before discharging the treated water to the receiving aqueous environment the optimum molar ratio for the peroxone process is h2o2 o3 0 5 mol mol katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 typical ozone doses in the peroxone process are 1 20 mg l peroxide can also be formed from reactions of ozone with the water matrix but its contribution to overall oh formation during wastewater ozonation is not significant nöthe et al 2009 o3 h2o2 is a well established process in drinking water treatment and water reuse applications e g windhoek namibia however recent studies have shown that benefits for its application in wastewater are limited due to high competition reactions and already efficient radical formation with ozone alone hübner et al 2015 however it might still be a valuable treatment option to minimize bromate formation during ozonation as discussed in section 3 2 1 3 o3 catalysts catalytic ozonation is distinguished between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation depending on the water solubility of the catalyst homogeneous catalytic ozonation can be described as a three step catalytic cycle as approached by pines and reckhow 2002 using co ii as a catalyst and oxalic acid 1 formation of co ii oxalate complex 2 oxidation by ozone to co iii oxalate complex and 3 decomposition of co iii oxalate complex forming an oxalate radical and co ii heterogeneous catalytic ozonation mechanisms are mediated by metal oxides e g tio2 al2o3 mno2 and result in more complex reaction paths based on multiple phase transport mechanisms and respective reactions as described in detail by beltrán 2004 both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation have shown their potential for water treatment at laboratory scale mainly based on lower ozone demand compared to ozonation alone bai et al 2016 wu et al 2016a 2016b xing et al 2016 however full scale application is limited due to catalyst recovery and a lack of understanding of the catalytic ozonation mechanisms nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 some studies report the use of activated carbon as a catalyst in catalytic ozonation e g kaptijn 1997 however oh production in this process is based on the reaction of ozone with pyrrol groups present on the activated carbon surface indicating that it acts rather as a radical promoter than a catalyst which needs to be continuously renewed to maintain efficient radical generation sánchez polo et al 2005 2 2 uv based aops uv based aops comprise processes based on uv irradiation mostly uv c and the combination of uv light with different radical promoters uv fluences applied for advanced oxidation are usually 200 mj cm2 and therefore exceed uv dose requirements for 4 log inactivation of most pathogens including uv resistant organisms e g adenovirus epa 2006 uv irradiation sources usually consist of either low lp or medium pressure mp mercury lamps with mono or polychromatic emission spectra respectively recently uv light emitting diode led light sources with specific wavelength distributions have been investigated and summarized for disinfection purposes song et al 2016 the principal advantages of leds compared to conventional medium and low pressure lamps are the elimination of mercury unique peak emission wavelengths compact size and therefore flexible application design as well as a short start up phase however despite the prediction of future uv led wall plug efficiencies of about 75 in 2020 autin et al 2013 current diodes emit uv radiation at efficiencies of 10 chen et al 2017 this results in eeo values for led systems that are not yet competitive with conventional uv systems wang et al 2017 and are therefore not considered in this study the most frequently applied uv based aop is the combination with h2o2 other radical promoters such as persulfate to form sulfate radicals and chlorine hydroxyl radicals and radical chlorine species are also being investigated besides established oxidants keen et al 2012 investigated the applicability of nitrate in combination with mp lamps as an alternative uv based aop however to the best of our knowledge no eeo values are available for this process 2 2 1 uv h2o2 the combination of uv irradiation and h2o2 leads to the photolytic cleavage of h2o2 into two oh however the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 is relatively low with ε 18 6 m 1cm 1 at λ 254 nm resulting in a h2o2 turnover of 10 if lp uv lamps are used high concentrations of h2o2 are required to generate sufficient oh h2o2 5 20 mg l leading to the necessity of removing residual h2o2 in a subsequent step applied h2o2 doses are mainly set based on economic aspects however at higher concentrations also scavenging of oh with h2o2 koh h2o2 2 7 107 m 1s 1 might affect the radical yield buxton et al 1988 uv h2o2 for torc removal has been examined widely throughout peer reviewed journal articles at lab scale wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 keen et al 2016 for water qualities ranging from ultrapure water to landfill leachate xiao et al 2016 ghazi et al 2014 first full scale applications are already established for potable water reuse audenaert et al 2011 and surface water treatment applications kruithof et al 2007 uv h2o2 is not established for advanced wastewater treatment mainly because of low uv transmittance and high scavenging capacity of secondary or tertiary treated wastewater effluents but is used in some potable reuse treatment trains employing integrated membrane systems ultrafiltration reverse osmosis drewes and khan 2015 based on its negligible obp formation potential as discussed in section 3 2 2 2 uv o3 in the uv o3 process uv irradiation λ 300 nm results in a cleavage of dissolved ozone followed by a fast reaction of atomic oxygen with water to form a thermally excited h2o2 subsequently the excited peroxide decomposes into two oh von sonntag 2008 ozone has a molar extinction coefficient of ε 3300 m 1cm 1 at λ 254 nm which is significantly higher than that of h2o2 at this particular wavelength however due to cage recombinations only a small proportion of generated h2o2 decomposes to oh resulting in a free oh quantum yield of only 0 1 reisz et al 2003 furthermore both uv lamps and ozone generator need large amounts of electrical energy resulting in relatively high energy demands for the combination of uv and ozone direct oxidation by the combination of ozonation and photolysis covers a wide range of torc reactivity and leads to the main advantage of this process however low energy efficiency of radical generation might explain that to the best of our knowledge no published data on full scale uv o3 application are available 2 2 3 uv so4 an interesting alternative to oh based aops is uv so4 which generates primarily sulfate radicals so4 for the oxidation of organic contaminants in water lutze 2013 ao and liu 2016 wacławek et al 2017 ike et al 2018 sulfate radicals have a strong oxidizing power and are more selective oxidants than oh lutze et al 2015 peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 is homolytically cleaved by uv c activation the quantum yield of s2o8 2 is larger than h2o2 1 4 compared to 1 0 and molar absorption for s2o8 2 is slightly higher as well 22 m 1cm 1 and 18 6 m 1cm 1 respectively resulting in a higher generation of radicals using pds as oxidizing agent legrini et al 1993 lutze 2013 xiao et al 2016 peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 is activated by uv radiation into a so4 and a oh with a quantum yield of 0 52 at ph 7 guan et al 2011 several studies have investigated the mechanisms and application of uv pms antoniou et al 2010 khan et al 2014 mahdi ahmed and chiron 2014 however based on its lower quantum yield high commercial pricing and low availability of eeo values it is not considered in this study wacławek et al 2017 recent research has shown the advantages of uv so4 compared to uv h2o2 in lab scale experiments khan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 xiao et al 2016 however based on more selective reactivity of sulfate radicals results reveal a higher sensitivity to water matrix changes and dom composition compared to uv h2o2 ahn et al 2017 depending on the respective target compound and water matrix so4 based aops can be a considerable alternative to oh based processes however uv pds yields in higher formation potential of obps in comparison to uv h2o2 see section 3 2 2 4 uv cl2 uv cl2 is another promising aop where uv activated chlorine forms radical species i e cl and cl2 and oh which then oxidize target compounds watts and linden 2007 cl is a more selective oxidant than oh since it reacts favorably with electron rich contaminants fang et al 2014 the two oxidants mainly used are hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide jin et al 2011 sichel et al 2011 fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however regarding hypochlorite ph dependency of hocl ocl speciation needs to be considered since it influences the molar absorption coefficient significantly uv cl2 is especially favorable for waters with lower ph values such as reverse osmosis permeate watts et al 2007 research has mainly been conducted on lab scale systems degrading organic indicator compounds jin et al 2011 sichel et al 2011 fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 a first full scale application for indirect potable reuse recently started operation at the los angeles terminal island water reclamation plant xylem 2015 however cl based reactions involve the formation of oxidative chlorine species e g clo ocl which might be oxidized by oh to chlorate perchlorate and halogenated obps see section 3 for more details 2 3 electrochemical aops electrochemical aops for water treatment applications were recently reviewed in detail by chaplin 2014 the major electrode types commonly used in this process are doped sno2 zhuo et al 2011 pbo2 bonfatti 1999 fernandes et al 2014 ruo2 quan et al 2013 boron doped diamond bdd chaplin et al 2013 and sub stoichiometric and doped tio2 kesselman et al 1997 bejan et al 2009 however bdd electrodes are the most applied eaop method due to their relatively low production costs compared to other electrodes and high stability of the diamond layer under anodic polarization chaplin 2014 the electrochemical oxidative treatment of contaminated water with bdd electrodes can generate oh directly via o2 evolution from water oxidation tröster et al 2004 as diamond is a non conductor it is doped with boron to use it as an electrode material that is deposited onto a carrier material such as niobium tantalum or silicon by chemical vapor deposition haenni et al 1998 the radicals are generated without the addition of further chemicals therefore bdd electrode treatment attracts interest as an eco friendly and efficient method for the removal of various pollutants however since oh generation occurs directly on the electrode surface and reactivity range of oh is limited to about 1 μm kapałka et al 2009 diffusive transport through the boundary layer at the electrode surface is the limiting factor of high oxidation efficiencies for eaop processes hydrodynamic parameters therefore have to be considered as energy used to pump water might account for the greatest share of energy consumption in this process this applies especially if low current densities are used to achieve higher oh formation efficiency prolonging overall treatment duration and pumping energy requirements apart from the oxidation of torcs in water treatment bdd electrodes are investigated for disinfection purposes as well as for the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod rajab et al 2013 2015 besides the generation of oh secondary oxidants which enhance elimination reactions and disinfection in the bulk solution can be produced rajab et al 2015 a limiting factor for the applicability of bdd is unintentional formation of halogenated obps as discussed in section 3 von gunten 2003b bergmann and rollin 2007 bergmann et al 2011 nevertheless several full scale eaop systems for cod removal are already applied woisetschläger et al 2015 2 4 catalytic aops 2 4 1 fenton process the combination of ferrous iron fe ii and h2o2 at acidic conditions results in oh formation fenton reaction iron acts as a catalyst with maximum catalytic activity at ph 3 particularly due to the precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide at higher ph value wadley and waite 2004 excess addition of h2o2 leads to the reduction of fe iii to fe ii safarzadeh amiri et al 1996 by substitution of iron oxides by other transition metals enhanced torc removal performance can be achieved jiang et al 2010 rahim pouran et al 2014 piscitelli et al 2015 to prevent iron precipitation the fenton process is restricted to acidic conditions therefore alternative iron free fenton like processes have recently been investigated as summarized by bokare and choi 2014 main advantages of the fenton process are operation at low costs sánchez perez et al 2013 and possibility of easy magnetic separation of residual iron the fenton process is therefore established in several industrial full scale applications e g bae et al 2015 2 4 2 photocatalytic aops the use of photo active catalysts for oxidation processes in water treatment has been investigated intensively over the last decades blake 2001 dong et al 2015 vallejo et al 2015 although there are numerous catalysts with photocatalytic properties i e tio2 wo3 or zno research has mainly concentrated on two types of reactions based on the solubility of the catalyst homogeneous photo fenton processes 2 f e o h 2 h ν f e 2 o h heterogeneous photocatalysis based on semiconductors tio2 simonsen et al 2010 3 t i o 2 h ν e h 4 h o h a d o h a d uv and visible light λ 180 400 nm accelerate the fenton process by photoreduction of fe iii however the quantum yield for this reaction is relatively low wadley and waite 2004 hence it is directly coupled with the fenton process photo fenton processes with an organic ligand e g ferrioxalate have a higher quantum yield and thus a higher efficiency due to the high uv absorption of fe iii polycarboxylates additionally the ferrioxalate complex can absorb radiation up to a wavelength of λ 550 nm making it suitable for solar driven aops hislop and bolton 1999 a recent review of photo fenton applications for wastewater treatment is given by rahim pouran et al 2015 in tio2 based photocatalysis a semiconductor material is irradiated by uv light λ 400 nm it is usually investigated as suspended colloidal particles or immobilized on different substrates if photons with sufficient energy hit the photocatalyst surface an electron is excited to the conduction band leaving a positively charged hole h in the valence band eq 3 these species can cause oxidative or reductive transformations of water constituents either directly on the semiconductor surface or via radical reactions eq 4 a sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen is necessary for the latter reactions the combination of oxidation and reduction mechanisms is specific for photocatalysis whereas other aops are based only on oh reactions unfortunately the quantum yield of tio2 photocatalysis for oxidation and reduction of contaminants is usually very low ϕ 0 04 due to the fast recombination of electron hole pairs sun and bolton 1996 addition of an electron donor e g citric acid may lead to the filling of positive holes and increased reduction rates from the negative electrons in the conduction band vohra and davis 2000 oliveira et al 2015 advantages of tio2 photocatalysis for torc removal include low costs of the catalyst itself and easy commercial availability in various crystalline forms and particle characteristics furthermore the catalyst is non toxic and photochemically stable the limitation of heterogeneous photo catalysis application at full scale is mainly based on two factors 1 separation of colloidal catalyst from the water suspension after treatment and 2 mass transfer limitations to the surface of the immobilized catalyst on a substrate qu et al 2013 despite strong research efforts in the field of photocatalysis the process is rarely applied in industrial or municipal water treatment facilities because of the low quantum yield for oh radical production 2 5 physical aops 2 5 1 electrohydraulic discharge plasma liquid phase electrical discharge reactors have been investigated as aops in water treatment locke et al 2006 hijosa valsero et al 2014 strong electric fields applied within the water electrohydraulic discharge or between water and gas phase nonthermal plasma initiate both chemical and physical processes beside the direct oxidation of contaminants in the water various oxidizing radicals or active species uv radiation and shock waves are formed during the discharge which can promote oxidation jiang et al 2014 2 5 2 ultrasound sonication of water by ultrasound us 20 500 khz leads to the formation and collapse of micro bubbles from acoustical wave induced compression and rarefaction these bubbles implode violently after reaching a critical resonance size and generate transient high temperatures 5000 k high pressures 1000 bar and highly reactive radicals destruction of water contaminants occurs by thermal decomposition and various radical reactions mason and pétrier 2004 cavitation via ultrasound exhibits low interference from water matrix and less heat transfer compared to uv irradiation a comprehensive review of sonochemical methods is provided by pang et al 2011 sonochemical processes have proven to oxidize various aquatic contaminants in lab scale experiments mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 however the application of ultrasound is highly energy intensive and results in a very low electrical efficiency of this aop in comparison to other technologies goel et al 2004 mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 therefore the coupling of ultrasound with uv irradiation sonophotolysis oxidants o3 h2o2 or catalysts tio2 sonocatalysis or both sonophotocatalysis receives increased attention these hybrid processes can yield additional advantages however major improvement of energy efficiency is often achieved due to the higher efficiency of the coupled additional processes e g uv h2o2 in us uv h2o2 mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 2 5 3 microwave the application of highly energetic radiation in the microwave range 300 mhz 300 ghz has been investigated for the oxidation of water contaminants microwaves have been used in combination with oxidants h2o2 or catalysts tio2 gac to assist in the destruction of organic pollutants han et al 2004 zhihui et al 2005 bo et al 2006 microwaves can enhance reaction rates and induce selective heating of the contaminants through internal molecule vibration additionally microwaves can generate uv radiation via an electrodeless discharge lamp for combined mw uv reactors unfortunately most of the applied microwave energy is converted into heat beside the low electrical efficiency eeo not readily available in literature cooling devices have to be employed to prevent treated water from overheating 2 5 4 electron beam the utilisation of ionizing radiation from an electron beam source 0 01 10 mev for water treatment has been tested since the 1980s the accelerated electrons penetrate the water surface and result in the formation of electronically excited species in the water including various ionic species and free radicals the maximum penetration depth of the accelerated electrons is directly proportional to the energy of the incident electrons e g 7 mm reported by nickelsen 1994 therefore water is irradiated in a thin film or as a sprayed aerosol this process exhibits a high oxidizing power and little interference by the water matrix and the electrical efficiency is within the feasibility range eeo 3 kwh m3 order for most contaminants bolton et al 1998 due to the high capital costs for an electron accelerator usually 1 million us the related risk potential from x rays and hence the necessary security measures further development of the electron beam process does not seem profitable 3 oxidation by products oxidation by product generation during the application of aops is a critical factor for process viability the abundance of nitrogen halogens and dissolved organic matter dom during disinfection of aops might lead to formation of organic halogenated by products such as total organic halides tox trihalomethanes thm haloacetic acids haa haloacetonitriles han and inorganic by products e g chlorate perchlorate and bromate all aops are based on radical oxidation paths however obp formation is diverse depending on radical type e g oh sulfate or chlorine radical radical exposure abundancy of other influencing water constituents e g radical scavengers and direct reactions of applied oxidants such as for instance ozone or chlorine occurrence and health risks of by products in drinking water as well as an overview of regulations and guidelines for specific disinfection by products is comprehensively reviewed richardson et al 2007 stalter et al 2016 while assessing the health risks from obps is challenging there is a general desire to minimize their formation thus in the following sections obp formation is discussed considering main reaction mechanisms divided into reactions with inorganic and organic compounds to identify opportunities to minimize their formation 3 1 reactions with inorganic compounds the oxyhalides chlorite chlorate perchlorate and bromate are potential inorganic by products of oxidation processes bromate bro3 which is regulated in drinking water worldwide can generally be formed in a pure oh reaction if br is abundant in the feed water von gunten and oliveras 1998 however this reaction is suppressed by dom lutze et al 2014 and in processes with excess h2o2 uv h2o2 fenton reaction where the oxidation of the intermediate hobr to bro3 is hindered by the fast reductive reaction with h2o2 to br k 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 von gunten 2003b therefore bro3 formation is negligible in most oh dominated systems chlorate and perchlorate formation during oh radical processes only occurs under certain conditions the initial reaction of oh radicals with cl is slow with a rate constant in the order of 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and formation of cl radicals can therefore be neglected at neutral conditions von gunten 2003b if oxidative chlorine species are abundant e g clo ocl however sequential oxidation by oh radicals to chlorate and perchlorate is possible in so4 based processes bro3 formation may be formed in a direct reaction of br with so4 kso4 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 redpath and willson 1975 in the absence of dom lutze et al 2014 in addition bro3 formation may occur from so4 reaction with cl to form oh and cl turning so4 based process into a cl and oh dominated process in some cases oh are directly formed on active surfaces e g the anode surface in eaops or the catalyst surface in heterogeneous caops and can only react within the diffusion limited zone of about 1 μm kapałka et al 2009 these conditions might induce high radical densities at the surface allowing kinetically unfavored oxidation of cl br and intermediate species forming bromate chlorate and perchlorate e g bergmann and rollin 2007 a detailed literature review on obp formation in eaops has recently been compiled by chaplin 2014 in ozone based aops at elevated bromide concentrations 100 μg l direct reaction of ozone can lead to 5 50 conversion of bromide to bromate depending on ozone exposure the fast decomposition of ozone in aops limits this reaction von gunten 2003a but significant bromate formation was still observed at elevated ozone dosages in the o3 h2o2 process hübner et al 2015 since chloride is not oxidized by ozone chlorate formation is only relevant for ozonation if pre oxidation by reactive chlorine species is applied von gunten 2003b as discussed above formation of chlorate perchlorate and bromate is not critical in uv based aops but other inorganic by products can be formed if dom containing water samples 10 mgc l are exposed to vacuum uv or lp uv irradiation h2o2 formation can reach up to 1 5 and 0 3 mg l respectively buchanan et al 2006 furthermore photolysis of nitrate may form nitrite during uv irradiation while the molar absorption coefficient of nitrate at λ 254 nm is low ε 4 m 1cm 1 it increases dramatically below 240 nm sharpless and linden 2001 revealing higher nitrite formation potentials for mp and vuv systems 3 2 reactions with organic compounds reactions of oh with dom generally involve hydrogen abstraction electrophilic addition and radical combination despite their electrophilic character these reactions are quite diverse and formation of significant obp concentrations was not observed in oh dominated oxidation processes for general water applications uv h2o2 for example was described as an aop without significant obp formation and no or minor increase of genotoxic activity if applied to surface water linden et al 2005 some studies however describe significant organic obp formation during uv h2o2 at high ph and cl concentrations 1 g l evaluated as adsorbable organic halides aox baycan et al 2007 despite the slow reactivity of oh with cl at high concentrations of cl formation of chlorine radicals cl cl2 and active chlorine species e g cl2 ocl hocl is sufficient these species can subsequently react with organic compounds by addition and substitution reactions resulting in halogenated obps oppenländer 2003 main formation paths of halogenated organic obps e g thm han and haa are based on reactions between oxoacids hypohalites hox ox and dom where the addition of halogens to dom increases following the order cl i br von gunten 2003b consequently uv chlorine process may involve formation of aox in contrast under mass transfer limited conditions organic obps are continuously generated bagastyo et al 2012 in ozone based aops the main pathway for generation of halogenated organic compounds is still the reaction of hox ox with dom as described above formation of bromo organic compounds 10 μg l depending on bromide concentration during raw surface water ozonation has been confirmed by huang et al 2005 since the oxidation of hoi and oi by ozone is fast ph 8 reaction of hoi with dom can be neglected for ozonation processes von gunten 2003b formation of hocl is not relevant for ozonation based on the low reactivity of ozone with chloride as described in section 4 1 1 resulting in a low relevance of chlorinated organic obps of higher concern is the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a highly carcinogenic substance mainly formed by chlorination of nitrogen and organic carbon containing waters some studies reported its occurrence after ozonation andrzejewski et al 2008 detailed reaction pathways for ndma formation during ozonation are proposed by yang et al 2009 however ndma is not a major by product of ozonation von gunten 2003b andrzejewski et al 2008 during uv chlorine ndma formation could be inhibited in a pilot scale system by quenching excess chlorine with thiosulfate sichel et al 2011 in uv based processes ndma is effectively removed by uv photolysis stefan and bolton 2002 mitch et al 2003 sharpless and linden 2003 other aops are less efficient removing ndma due to moderate and low second order rate constants with oh koh 3 8 108 m 1s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 and ozone ko3 0 052 m 1s 1 lee et al 2007 a common strategy to control ndma concentrations in water is the removal of precursors such as dimethylamine which can easily be oxidized by ozonation or aop lee et al 2007 however also subsequent biological steps are effective to mitigate ndma drewes et al 2006 recently researchers have shown the potential of mutagenic organic by product formation during application of medium pressure uv irradiation to water containing nitrate hofman caris et al 2015 kolkman et al 2015 the photolysis products of nitrate mainly peroxynitrite react with dom by hydroxylation nitration and nitrosation reactions forming organic obps martijn et al 2014 while potential reaction mechanisms have been proposed reckhow et al 2010 shah et al 2011 a comprehensive understanding has not yet been completed however nitrated aromatic compounds are expected to be the most toxic obps formed in this process martijn et al 2014 4 comparison of advanced oxidation processes eeo values derived for a specific aop are depending on the molecular structure the physico chemical characteristics such as specific reaction rate constants and the concentration range of the respective contaminant only if 1 mg l furthermore water matrix process capacity and energy independent process parameters e g oxidant or catalyst dose can have a significant influence on the efficiency of the process in general eeo values should only be determined for an aop which is optimized with respect to oxidant demand reactor geometry and other process specific parameters all these interdependencies should be kept in mind while comparing different aop technologies via eeo hence the boundary conditions in which eeo values were determined are very important for the overall comparison of aops via eeo it should be noted that additional energy demand for chemicals or catalysts is not reflected within this figure of merit the demand for auxiliary oxidants e g h2o2 however can be reflected within the eeo concept by regarding h2o2 as stored electric energy rosenfeldt et al 2006 for example müller et al 2001 calculated an equivalent of 10 kwh for 1 kg of h2o2 100 based on the commercial prices in germany however the majority of published eeo values are limited to the electricity which is directly used in the process e g for ozone generation or uv lamp operation several peer reviewed journal articles deal with the direct comparison of different aops in a defined experimental setup with controlled conditions i e in terms of water quality to be treated target contaminant and other process conditions with the aim to reveal the most efficient aop technology however many of these studies are lacking important information neglecting relevant parameters or testing removal of substances with specific reactivity to oxidants other than oh e g ozone reactive or photolytically degradable compounds furthermore comparison is only conducted in few water matrices and generalization of those results and their transfer to application with other water types contaminants etc should therefore be made with careful consideration of the respective conditions for this reason we critically reviewed and compared reported eeo values from different aops results are discussed and put in context to studies showing direct comparison if available in addition we analyzed major influencing factors on eeo determination based on literature data for the uv h2o2 process 4 1 comparative screening of eeo values for different aops eeo values for numerous aops from literature data are illustrated in fig 2 as box plots sorted according to their respective median values a summary of all data including specific information on water type system size and measured compounds is given at mendeley data https doi org 10 17632 n7h8kb4dfh 2 only data meeting the following criteria were included in the figure incorporated data is published in a peer reviewed process manufacturer data and data from non peer reviewed sources are included if detailed information about the experimental setup is given if kinetic data is available compounds which are susceptible to direct oxidation by e g ozone or uv photolysis will not be regarded threshold values for rate constants in o3 and uv based processes are set at ko3 10 m 1s 1 and kuv 10 5 m2 j data evaluation was conducted in three steps screening of eeo values single outlier detection and removal and descriptive statistics outlier detection was performed by the dixon test assuming log normal distribution for all data sets using an online tool available at http contchart com outliers aspx significance testing was performed using the two sample t test provided by another online tool http www evanmiller org ab testing t test html assuming log normal distribution for all data sets reported eeo values for individual aops often vary by several orders of magnitude in case of ozonation the strong variability might be explained by the dependence of radical formation from water matrix since it is only initiated by hydroxide ions at elevated ph or from ozone reactions with organic matter little variability of other processes might either indicate lower sensitivity to water quality and system design or limited experimental differences in literature data e g oxidation with microwaves was only tested in ultrapure water despite cases of high variability significant differences between aops can be observed from the literature study based on median values aops are classified in three groups processes with median eeo values 1 kwh m3 o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine and electron beam represent a realistic range for full scale application group 1 photo fenton plasma and eaop with median eeo values of 2 6 3 3 and 38 1 kwh m3 1 100 kwh m3 respectively are likely too energy intensive for most practical applications group 2 however they might still provide attractive solutions for specific challenges and full scale applicability of these processes should be further investigated eeo values for group 2 processes are significantly higher than values of group 1 p 0 045 processes with eéo values 100 kwh m3 i e uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops representing high median values of 335 2616 and 543 kwh m3 respectively are considered as not yet energy efficient aops significance of difference between group 2 and 3 is calculated as p 0 002 there are only few quality studies directly comparing processes from these different groups a direct comparison of uv h2o2 and bdd treatment for aniline removal from synthetic wastewater solutions confirmed lower eeo values for uv h2o2 by about 30 benito et al 2017 however extensive concentrations of h2o2 were applied in this study 1 5 g l that might have influenced calculated eeo values of uv h2o2 by re scavenging of oh by h2o2 observed differences between aops in the first group are statistically not significant p 0 2 in between all aops and most likely depend on experimental conditions this is confirmed by several studies comparing o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 sutherland and coworkers published a comprehensive evaluation of mtbe oxidation from five contaminated groundwaters with highly variable water quality characteristics sutherland et al 2004 depending on water type and adjusted ph either o3 h2o2 or uv h2o2 achieved lower eeo values in contrast lester et al 2011 reported lowest eéo values for o3 h2o2 followed by o3 uv h2o2 o3 uv o3 and uv for pharmaceutical degradation in phosphate buffer also müller et al 2001 showed advantages of the o3 h2o2 combination in comparison to uv h2o2 and uv o3 a recent study compared the efficiency of uv pds and uv h2o2 during iodoacids degradation considering most relevant influencing factors e g photo susceptibility and process capacity xiao et al 2016 special emphasis was directed to water matrix and oxidant dose effect results revealed higher energy efficiencies for the sulfate radical based aop by a factor of 3 however comparison of these processes using single compounds or specific compound groups needs to be evaluated carefully since sulfate radicals react more selectively than oh 4 2 principal influences on eeo values shown at the uv h2o2 process most boxplots for individual aops in fig 2 reveal high variances being mainly based on data variability considered in this review water quality process capacity and the selection of target chemicals are key parameters which may lead to large deviations of eeo values within one process effects of these factors is exemplarily illustrated in the following section using the dataset of uv h2o2 which is one of the most intensively investigated aops and therefore supplies high data density of eeo values n 149 excluding single outliers and data of photo susceptible compounds however transferability of influencing factors is not ensured for other aops since most influences are process specific 4 2 1 influence of process capacity eeo values from uv h2o2 studies conducted at laboratory pilot and full scale are illustrated in fig 3 median eeo values decrease with process capacity from 2 2 kwh m3 at lab scale to 0 68 and 0 5 kwh m3 for pilot and full scale applications respectively a significant difference could be observed p 0 05 between lab and pilot scale data the median values indicate that up scaling enhances energy efficiency which confirms the findings from bolton and stefan 2002 results furthermore emphasize that comparison of lab scale energy consumption not necessarily represents operation at full scale if possible energy demand should rather be estimated based on full scale system design with relevant operational parameters i e oxidant dosage uv fluence determined in standardized lab or pilot scale experiments 4 2 2 influence of compound reactivity energy efficiency of aops is also dependent on compound reactivity therefore gathered eeo values from reviewed uv h2o2 publications were correlated to second order rate constants koh of photo resistant target chemicals results indicated a slightly negative correlation r2 0 21 confirming that substances with higher koh values are more efficiently oxidized with a lower energy effort fig s1 however due to the low correlation coefficient the influence of other parameters e g process capacity is assumed to be higher 4 2 3 influence of water quality water quality mainly affects the uv h2o2 process by uv transmittance and radical scavengers therefore eeo values were investigated based on water characteristics reported from the respective article since numerous water types were included in all data gathered ranging from ultrapure lab water to industrial wastewater effluents eeo values were classified into main water application groups pure water drinking water groundwater and wastewater applications pure water applications include lab scale experiments with deionized and ultrapure water but also pilot scale applications with reverse osmosis permeate i e in water reuse drinking water applications summarize uv h2o2 processes with surface water after pre treatment with various process combinations groundwater applications include aops at contaminated sites as well as drinking water applications from groundwater wastewater consists of secondary and tertiary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants and industrial applications resulting eeo values of pure water drinking water groundwater and wastewater applications are presented in fig 4 as box plots median eeo values of each application were determined as 2 7 0 63 2 7 and 2 2 kwh m3 respectively however no significant difference could be observed between different groups p 0 05 the concentration of radical scavengers and uv absorbance uva are the most influential parameters for radical yield and radical oxidation efficiency consequently waters with higher scavenger concentrations and different scavenger composition and higher uva should result in higher eeo values surprisingly ultrapure water applications reveal the highest median eeo value in this comparison a possible explanation for this finding might be the predominant use of pure water in lab scale experiments which biases the illustration as already discussed in section 4 2 1 data comparison from drinking and wastewater applications reveal higher energy needs with increasing scavenger content especially doc and consequently uva are expected to be higher in this order in contrast to drinking water the median eeo value from groundwater applications is similar to wastewater oxidation groundwater may contain strongly variable inorganic concentrations e g alkalinity hco3 co3 2 but also reduced species like manganese and iron which might significantly scavenge oh radicals overall the operational classification of aops presented in fig 4 did not suggest any significant effects of water matrix on eeo values probably because the selected categories like pure water drinking water groundwater and wastewater are not specific enough and can include a wide range of different applications and water qualities therefore a direct correlation of water quality parameters with reported eeo values was also investigated considered as most relevant parameters doc uv transmittance and turbidity reported as ntu data were provided for 124 131 and 31 of the reviewed 147 data sets respectively a direct relationship within the reviewed data set between eeo values and doc concentrations uv transmittance or ntu however could not be revealed figs s2 and s3 4 2 4 influence of lamp type the influence of different lamp types on eeo values is illustrated in fig 5 mp uv lamps result in significantly higher eeo values compared to lp lamps p 0 001 the respective median values can be determined as 1 0 and 0 4 kwh m3 this is not surprising since the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 increases at wavelengths 260 nm and lp lamps depict higher 35 at 254 nm energy efficiencies than mp lamps 10 at 254 nm inevitably lp lamps yield in a higher h2o2 activation and consequently in lower eeo values this was also confirmed by rosenfeldt et al 2005 who directly compared lp and mp uv lamps for the oxidation of 2 methyl isoborneol 2 mib and geosmin raw blend surface water and filtered clearwell water were used in lab scale reactors eeo values revealed that lp lamps can be more energy efficient than mp lamps for oh generation 5 conclusions this study provides a critical review of different established and emerging aops including a mechanistic discussion of process specific by product formation to facilitate a comparison of energy efficiency data were collected for various aops in an extensive analysis of peer reviewed journal articles and critically compared based on reported eeo values despite high variability of results from individual processes significant differences between aops efficiency were observed based on reported eeo values processes were classified into 1 aops with median eeo values of 1 kwh m3 o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine electron beam 2 processes with median eeo values in the range of 1 100 kwh m3 photo fenton plasma and electrolytic aops and 3 uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops median eeo values of 100 kwh m3 which are considered as not yet energy efficient aops a more detailed evaluation of data for the uv h2o2 process showed highest impact of uv lamp type water matrix and process capacity lab scale vs pilot and full scale on resulting eeo values no significant correlation could be observed between eeo values and compound reactivity with oh radicals in addition reviewed literature indicates that by product formation from hydroxyl radicals is not critical unless formed at high density on surface areas e g in electrolytic aops however aops involving other oxidants such as ozone sulfate radicals or chlorine radicals need to be evaluated in more detail since site and process specific by products might be formed this study confirmed the main limitation to use the eeo concept for a general comparison of different aops due to the variability of the above mentioned influencing factors however if all factors are considered within a direct comparison the eeo concept provides a powerful figure of merit to directly compare and evaluate aops based on energy efficiency appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementray material

19552,this study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes aops in addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by products data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging aops based on electrical energy per order eeo values despite strong variations within reviewed eeo values significant differences could be observed between three groups of aops 1 o3 often considered as aop like process o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine and electron beam represent median eeo values of 1 kwh m3 while median energy consumption by 2 photo fenton plasma and electrolytic aops were significantly higher eeo values in the range of 1 100 kwh m3 3 uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops are characterized by median values of 100 kwh m3 and were therefore considered as not yet energy efficient aops specific evaluation of 147 data points for the uv h2o2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported eeo values besides water type and quality a major influence was observed for process capacity lab vs pilot vs full scale applications and in case of uv based processes of the lamp type however due to the contribution of other factors correlation of eeo values with specific water quality parameters such as uv absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial also correlations between eeo and compound reactivity with oh radicals were not significant photolytically active compounds were not considered based on these findings recommendations regarding the use of the eeo concept including the upscaling of laboratory results were derived graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process trace organic chemicals oxidation by products oh radical

et al 2010 besides urban and agricultural run offs wastewater treatment plant effluents are considered to be the most significant torc emitters lim 2008 gros et al 2010 luo et al 2014 torcs remain in wastewater treatment plant effluents being discharged into surface waters since conventional physical and biological wastewater treatment can only partially remove these substances lim 2008 zhang et al 2008 luo et al 2014 the application of advanced oxidation processes aops provides a viable and effective attenuation option due to the oxidation of a wide range of torcs comninellis et al 2008 klavarioti et al 2009 yang et al 2014 giannakis et al 2015 stefan 2018 according to the definition of bolton et al 1996 and bolton et al 2001 aops are based on the in situ generation of strong oxidants for the oxidation of organic compounds this includes processes based on oh radicals oh which constitute the majority of available aops but also processes based on other oxidizing species favoring sulfate or chlorine radicals there are various different process technologies which have been investigated for use as aops several aops especially those involving ozonation and uv irradiation are already well established and operated at full scale in drinking water treatment and water reuse facilities however new studies of numerous emerging aops for water treatment i e electrochemical aop plasma electron beam ultrasound or microwave based aops are constantly being reported by various researchers stefan 2018 the huge amount of different studies and an increasing number of proposed technologies and process combinations pose an enormous challenge for a critical assessment of aops concerning their operational costs i e energy consumption chemical input sustainability i e resource use carbon footprint and general feasibility e g physical footprint and oxidation by product formation to enable comparison of their efficiency with other aops and alternative treatment processes to address this issue bolton and coworkers developed figures of merit for the comparison of advanced oxidation processes bolton et al 2001 these are based on electrical energy consumption which often represents a major fraction of the aop operating costs for low contaminant concentrations typically 100 mg l the kinetics of destruction of organic contaminants by aops can often be described phenomenologically by simple pseudo first order rate expressions thus the oxidant or energy dosage scales with the volume and treatment goals i e orders of magnitude of reduction per unit volume consequently the figure of merit for electrical driven aops is defined as eeo electrical energy per order electrical energy per order is the electrical energy in kwh required to degrade a contaminant c by one order of magnitude in 1 m 3 of contaminated water bolton et al 1996 this figure of merit has been accepted by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac in 2001 bolton et al 2001 and numerous eeo values have been reported since then in literature for various oxidation processes and applications giving a direct link to the electrical efficiency of the aop this approach allows not only for a simple comparison of different aop technologies but also provides the requisite data for scale up and economic as well as sustainability analyses for comparison with conventional treatment technologies e g activated carbon adsorption air stripping in aqueous systems oxidation of a specific compound c follows a second order reaction where the relative residual concentration is a function of compound specific rate constant koh and the oh exposure accordingly oh exposure can be determined from experimental data using equation 1 1 o h d t ln c c 0 k o h s the oh exposure is controlled by the radical formation efficiency of the respective process as well as competing reactions with other constituents in the water called radical scavenging major radical scavengers are carbonate bicarbonate nitrite and organic matter indicating a strong dependency of compound removal and thus eeo values on the water matrix besides radical scavenging the water matrix might also directly affect the in situ generation of radicals in several processes e g by reducing uv transmittance or reactions with ozone in ozone based aops for these reasons the application of eeo values for a comparison of experimental results from different water matrices is not recommended and comparative studies to evaluate efficiency of different aops in a defined water matrix are needed bolton et al 2001 to date only few studies directly comparing different aops are available bolton et al 1998 müller et al 2001 alaton et al 2002 katsoyiannis et al 2011 ureña de vivanco et al 2013 lutterbeck et al 2015 fast et al 2017 and they are mostly limited to a few established processes to the best of our knowledge such a comprehensive comparison across different aops has not yet been conducted this article provides a critical review of different established and emerging aops based on data compiled during an extensive literature study an initial comparative assessment is conducted based on eeo values reported in the peer reviewed literature for different aops influencing aspects such as reaction rate constants of target substances water matrix process capacity or system parameters are considered and critically evaluated as a result recommendations for the use of the eeo concept in future studies are presented in addition this article also provides an assessment on by product formation in different aops based on reaction mechanisms of different oxidants 2 background regarding advanced oxidation processes for contaminant removal in water technologies for aops involve widely different methods of activation as well as oxidant generation and can potentially utilize a number of different mechanisms for organic destruction an overview of different established and emerging aops is given in fig 1 categorized into ozone based uv based electrochemical eaop catalytic caop and physical paop aops however it is noteworthy that this classification scheme should not be viewed as strict since several processes involve different technologies and thus could be assigned to various categories the different processes summarized in fig 1 represent processes of very different degrees of implementation from well established aops to processes only tested at laboratory scale yet all aops comprise of two steps the in situ formation of reactive oxidative species and the reaction of oxidants with target contaminants mechanisms of radical formation depend on process specific parameters and can be affected by system design and water quality besides radical scavenging also other parameters e g radical mass transfer in surface based aops hydrodynamics play an important role for efficiency of contaminant destruction in the following sections the current status of implementation is reviewed major mechanisms and principles of radical generation are illustrated and constraints of different aops are briefly discussed more comprehensive overview on system design reaction principles and kinetics can be found in various book publications on aops parsons 2004 collins and bolton 2016 stefan 2018 mechanisms for the formation of oxidation by products obps in different aops are discussed separately in section 3 2 1 ozone based aops ozone has long been used as an oxidant and disinfectant in water treatment as an oxidant ozone is very selective and attacks primarily electron rich functional groups like double bonds amines and activated aromatic rings e g phenol since its reactions in real aqueous solutions often involve the formation of oh ozonation itself is often considered an aop or aop like process oh can be formed from the reaction of ozone with hydroxide ions merényi et al 2010a 2010b the initiation of this reaction however is quite slow with a second order rate constant of 70 m 1s 1 in addition radicals are formed as a side product from the reaction of ozone with organic matter mainly phenol and amine functional groups buffle and von gunten 2006 especially during ozonation of secondary effluents these reactions are the major contributors to radical formation methods to actively initiate formation of radicals include the ozonation at elevated ph and the combinations o3 h2o2 also called peroxone process o3 uv and o3 catalysts the combination of ozonation and uv irradiation will be discussed as a uv based aop in section 2 2 2 1 1 ozonation at elevated ph ozonation at elevated ph is considered as an aop if oh generation is intentionally favored elovitz and von gunten 1999 buffle et al 2006 the ph of treated water influences direct ozonation efficiency since dissociated target organic compounds might have significantly different ko3 values calderara et al 2002 furthermore the abundance of hydroxide ions directly influences the oh generation and therefore indirect ozonation especially if the water to be treated has a ph 8 ozonation applied as an aop might be a promising process if the precipitation of calcium carbonate is not of concern 2 1 2 peroxone process o3 h2o2 in the peroxone process ozone reacts with the peroxide anion ho2 to form oh precursors which are subsequently reacting to oh for a detailed mechanistic description of the peroxone process see merényi et al 2010a residual h2o2 might have to be destroyed before discharging the treated water to the receiving aqueous environment the optimum molar ratio for the peroxone process is h2o2 o3 0 5 mol mol katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 typical ozone doses in the peroxone process are 1 20 mg l peroxide can also be formed from reactions of ozone with the water matrix but its contribution to overall oh formation during wastewater ozonation is not significant nöthe et al 2009 o3 h2o2 is a well established process in drinking water treatment and water reuse applications e g windhoek namibia however recent studies have shown that benefits for its application in wastewater are limited due to high competition reactions and already efficient radical formation with ozone alone hübner et al 2015 however it might still be a valuable treatment option to minimize bromate formation during ozonation as discussed in section 3 2 1 3 o3 catalysts catalytic ozonation is distinguished between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation depending on the water solubility of the catalyst homogeneous catalytic ozonation can be described as a three step catalytic cycle as approached by pines and reckhow 2002 using co ii as a catalyst and oxalic acid 1 formation of co ii oxalate complex 2 oxidation by ozone to co iii oxalate complex and 3 decomposition of co iii oxalate complex forming an oxalate radical and co ii heterogeneous catalytic ozonation mechanisms are mediated by metal oxides e g tio2 al2o3 mno2 and result in more complex reaction paths based on multiple phase transport mechanisms and respective reactions as described in detail by beltrán 2004 both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation have shown their potential for water treatment at laboratory scale mainly based on lower ozone demand compared to ozonation alone bai et al 2016 wu et al 2016a 2016b xing et al 2016 however full scale application is limited due to catalyst recovery and a lack of understanding of the catalytic ozonation mechanisms nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 some studies report the use of activated carbon as a catalyst in catalytic ozonation e g kaptijn 1997 however oh production in this process is based on the reaction of ozone with pyrrol groups present on the activated carbon surface indicating that it acts rather as a radical promoter than a catalyst which needs to be continuously renewed to maintain efficient radical generation sánchez polo et al 2005 2 2 uv based aops uv based aops comprise processes based on uv irradiation mostly uv c and the combination of uv light with different radical promoters uv fluences applied for advanced oxidation are usually 200 mj cm2 and therefore exceed uv dose requirements for 4 log inactivation of most pathogens including uv resistant organisms e g adenovirus epa 2006 uv irradiation sources usually consist of either low lp or medium pressure mp mercury lamps with mono or polychromatic emission spectra respectively recently uv light emitting diode led light sources with specific wavelength distributions have been investigated and summarized for disinfection purposes song et al 2016 the principal advantages of leds compared to conventional medium and low pressure lamps are the elimination of mercury unique peak emission wavelengths compact size and therefore flexible application design as well as a short start up phase however despite the prediction of future uv led wall plug efficiencies of about 75 in 2020 autin et al 2013 current diodes emit uv radiation at efficiencies of 10 chen et al 2017 this results in eeo values for led systems that are not yet competitive with conventional uv systems wang et al 2017 and are therefore not considered in this study the most frequently applied uv based aop is the combination with h2o2 other radical promoters such as persulfate to form sulfate radicals and chlorine hydroxyl radicals and radical chlorine species are also being investigated besides established oxidants keen et al 2012 investigated the applicability of nitrate in combination with mp lamps as an alternative uv based aop however to the best of our knowledge no eeo values are available for this process 2 2 1 uv h2o2 the combination of uv irradiation and h2o2 leads to the photolytic cleavage of h2o2 into two oh however the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 is relatively low with ε 18 6 m 1cm 1 at λ 254 nm resulting in a h2o2 turnover of 10 if lp uv lamps are used high concentrations of h2o2 are required to generate sufficient oh h2o2 5 20 mg l leading to the necessity of removing residual h2o2 in a subsequent step applied h2o2 doses are mainly set based on economic aspects however at higher concentrations also scavenging of oh with h2o2 koh h2o2 2 7 107 m 1s 1 might affect the radical yield buxton et al 1988 uv h2o2 for torc removal has been examined widely throughout peer reviewed journal articles at lab scale wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 keen et al 2016 for water qualities ranging from ultrapure water to landfill leachate xiao et al 2016 ghazi et al 2014 first full scale applications are already established for potable water reuse audenaert et al 2011 and surface water treatment applications kruithof et al 2007 uv h2o2 is not established for advanced wastewater treatment mainly because of low uv transmittance and high scavenging capacity of secondary or tertiary treated wastewater effluents but is used in some potable reuse treatment trains employing integrated membrane systems ultrafiltration reverse osmosis drewes and khan 2015 based on its negligible obp formation potential as discussed in section 3 2 2 2 uv o3 in the uv o3 process uv irradiation λ 300 nm results in a cleavage of dissolved ozone followed by a fast reaction of atomic oxygen with water to form a thermally excited h2o2 subsequently the excited peroxide decomposes into two oh von sonntag 2008 ozone has a molar extinction coefficient of ε 3300 m 1cm 1 at λ 254 nm which is significantly higher than that of h2o2 at this particular wavelength however due to cage recombinations only a small proportion of generated h2o2 decomposes to oh resulting in a free oh quantum yield of only 0 1 reisz et al 2003 furthermore both uv lamps and ozone generator need large amounts of electrical energy resulting in relatively high energy demands for the combination of uv and ozone direct oxidation by the combination of ozonation and photolysis covers a wide range of torc reactivity and leads to the main advantage of this process however low energy efficiency of radical generation might explain that to the best of our knowledge no published data on full scale uv o3 application are available 2 2 3 uv so4 an interesting alternative to oh based aops is uv so4 which generates primarily sulfate radicals so4 for the oxidation of organic contaminants in water lutze 2013 ao and liu 2016 wacławek et al 2017 ike et al 2018 sulfate radicals have a strong oxidizing power and are more selective oxidants than oh lutze et al 2015 peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 is homolytically cleaved by uv c activation the quantum yield of s2o8 2 is larger than h2o2 1 4 compared to 1 0 and molar absorption for s2o8 2 is slightly higher as well 22 m 1cm 1 and 18 6 m 1cm 1 respectively resulting in a higher generation of radicals using pds as oxidizing agent legrini et al 1993 lutze 2013 xiao et al 2016 peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 is activated by uv radiation into a so4 and a oh with a quantum yield of 0 52 at ph 7 guan et al 2011 several studies have investigated the mechanisms and application of uv pms antoniou et al 2010 khan et al 2014 mahdi ahmed and chiron 2014 however based on its lower quantum yield high commercial pricing and low availability of eeo values it is not considered in this study wacławek et al 2017 recent research has shown the advantages of uv so4 compared to uv h2o2 in lab scale experiments khan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 xiao et al 2016 however based on more selective reactivity of sulfate radicals results reveal a higher sensitivity to water matrix changes and dom composition compared to uv h2o2 ahn et al 2017 depending on the respective target compound and water matrix so4 based aops can be a considerable alternative to oh based processes however uv pds yields in higher formation potential of obps in comparison to uv h2o2 see section 3 2 2 4 uv cl2 uv cl2 is another promising aop where uv activated chlorine forms radical species i e cl and cl2 and oh which then oxidize target compounds watts and linden 2007 cl is a more selective oxidant than oh since it reacts favorably with electron rich contaminants fang et al 2014 the two oxidants mainly used are hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide jin et al 2011 sichel et al 2011 fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however regarding hypochlorite ph dependency of hocl ocl speciation needs to be considered since it influences the molar absorption coefficient significantly uv cl2 is especially favorable for waters with lower ph values such as reverse osmosis permeate watts et al 2007 research has mainly been conducted on lab scale systems degrading organic indicator compounds jin et al 2011 sichel et al 2011 fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 a first full scale application for indirect potable reuse recently started operation at the los angeles terminal island water reclamation plant xylem 2015 however cl based reactions involve the formation of oxidative chlorine species e g clo ocl which might be oxidized by oh to chlorate perchlorate and halogenated obps see section 3 for more details 2 3 electrochemical aops electrochemical aops for water treatment applications were recently reviewed in detail by chaplin 2014 the major electrode types commonly used in this process are doped sno2 zhuo et al 2011 pbo2 bonfatti 1999 fernandes et al 2014 ruo2 quan et al 2013 boron doped diamond bdd chaplin et al 2013 and sub stoichiometric and doped tio2 kesselman et al 1997 bejan et al 2009 however bdd electrodes are the most applied eaop method due to their relatively low production costs compared to other electrodes and high stability of the diamond layer under anodic polarization chaplin 2014 the electrochemical oxidative treatment of contaminated water with bdd electrodes can generate oh directly via o2 evolution from water oxidation tröster et al 2004 as diamond is a non conductor it is doped with boron to use it as an electrode material that is deposited onto a carrier material such as niobium tantalum or silicon by chemical vapor deposition haenni et al 1998 the radicals are generated without the addition of further chemicals therefore bdd electrode treatment attracts interest as an eco friendly and efficient method for the removal of various pollutants however since oh generation occurs directly on the electrode surface and reactivity range of oh is limited to about 1 μm kapałka et al 2009 diffusive transport through the boundary layer at the electrode surface is the limiting factor of high oxidation efficiencies for eaop processes hydrodynamic parameters therefore have to be considered as energy used to pump water might account for the greatest share of energy consumption in this process this applies especially if low current densities are used to achieve higher oh formation efficiency prolonging overall treatment duration and pumping energy requirements apart from the oxidation of torcs in water treatment bdd electrodes are investigated for disinfection purposes as well as for the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod rajab et al 2013 2015 besides the generation of oh secondary oxidants which enhance elimination reactions and disinfection in the bulk solution can be produced rajab et al 2015 a limiting factor for the applicability of bdd is unintentional formation of halogenated obps as discussed in section 3 von gunten 2003b bergmann and rollin 2007 bergmann et al 2011 nevertheless several full scale eaop systems for cod removal are already applied woisetschläger et al 2015 2 4 catalytic aops 2 4 1 fenton process the combination of ferrous iron fe ii and h2o2 at acidic conditions results in oh formation fenton reaction iron acts as a catalyst with maximum catalytic activity at ph 3 particularly due to the precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide at higher ph value wadley and waite 2004 excess addition of h2o2 leads to the reduction of fe iii to fe ii safarzadeh amiri et al 1996 by substitution of iron oxides by other transition metals enhanced torc removal performance can be achieved jiang et al 2010 rahim pouran et al 2014 piscitelli et al 2015 to prevent iron precipitation the fenton process is restricted to acidic conditions therefore alternative iron free fenton like processes have recently been investigated as summarized by bokare and choi 2014 main advantages of the fenton process are operation at low costs sánchez perez et al 2013 and possibility of easy magnetic separation of residual iron the fenton process is therefore established in several industrial full scale applications e g bae et al 2015 2 4 2 photocatalytic aops the use of photo active catalysts for oxidation processes in water treatment has been investigated intensively over the last decades blake 2001 dong et al 2015 vallejo et al 2015 although there are numerous catalysts with photocatalytic properties i e tio2 wo3 or zno research has mainly concentrated on two types of reactions based on the solubility of the catalyst homogeneous photo fenton processes 2 f e o h 2 h ν f e 2 o h heterogeneous photocatalysis based on semiconductors tio2 simonsen et al 2010 3 t i o 2 h ν e h 4 h o h a d o h a d uv and visible light λ 180 400 nm accelerate the fenton process by photoreduction of fe iii however the quantum yield for this reaction is relatively low wadley and waite 2004 hence it is directly coupled with the fenton process photo fenton processes with an organic ligand e g ferrioxalate have a higher quantum yield and thus a higher efficiency due to the high uv absorption of fe iii polycarboxylates additionally the ferrioxalate complex can absorb radiation up to a wavelength of λ 550 nm making it suitable for solar driven aops hislop and bolton 1999 a recent review of photo fenton applications for wastewater treatment is given by rahim pouran et al 2015 in tio2 based photocatalysis a semiconductor material is irradiated by uv light λ 400 nm it is usually investigated as suspended colloidal particles or immobilized on different substrates if photons with sufficient energy hit the photocatalyst surface an electron is excited to the conduction band leaving a positively charged hole h in the valence band eq 3 these species can cause oxidative or reductive transformations of water constituents either directly on the semiconductor surface or via radical reactions eq 4 a sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen is necessary for the latter reactions the combination of oxidation and reduction mechanisms is specific for photocatalysis whereas other aops are based only on oh reactions unfortunately the quantum yield of tio2 photocatalysis for oxidation and reduction of contaminants is usually very low ϕ 0 04 due to the fast recombination of electron hole pairs sun and bolton 1996 addition of an electron donor e g citric acid may lead to the filling of positive holes and increased reduction rates from the negative electrons in the conduction band vohra and davis 2000 oliveira et al 2015 advantages of tio2 photocatalysis for torc removal include low costs of the catalyst itself and easy commercial availability in various crystalline forms and particle characteristics furthermore the catalyst is non toxic and photochemically stable the limitation of heterogeneous photo catalysis application at full scale is mainly based on two factors 1 separation of colloidal catalyst from the water suspension after treatment and 2 mass transfer limitations to the surface of the immobilized catalyst on a substrate qu et al 2013 despite strong research efforts in the field of photocatalysis the process is rarely applied in industrial or municipal water treatment facilities because of the low quantum yield for oh radical production 2 5 physical aops 2 5 1 electrohydraulic discharge plasma liquid phase electrical discharge reactors have been investigated as aops in water treatment locke et al 2006 hijosa valsero et al 2014 strong electric fields applied within the water electrohydraulic discharge or between water and gas phase nonthermal plasma initiate both chemical and physical processes beside the direct oxidation of contaminants in the water various oxidizing radicals or active species uv radiation and shock waves are formed during the discharge which can promote oxidation jiang et al 2014 2 5 2 ultrasound sonication of water by ultrasound us 20 500 khz leads to the formation and collapse of micro bubbles from acoustical wave induced compression and rarefaction these bubbles implode violently after reaching a critical resonance size and generate transient high temperatures 5000 k high pressures 1000 bar and highly reactive radicals destruction of water contaminants occurs by thermal decomposition and various radical reactions mason and pétrier 2004 cavitation via ultrasound exhibits low interference from water matrix and less heat transfer compared to uv irradiation a comprehensive review of sonochemical methods is provided by pang et al 2011 sonochemical processes have proven to oxidize various aquatic contaminants in lab scale experiments mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 however the application of ultrasound is highly energy intensive and results in a very low electrical efficiency of this aop in comparison to other technologies goel et al 2004 mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 therefore the coupling of ultrasound with uv irradiation sonophotolysis oxidants o3 h2o2 or catalysts tio2 sonocatalysis or both sonophotocatalysis receives increased attention these hybrid processes can yield additional advantages however major improvement of energy efficiency is often achieved due to the higher efficiency of the coupled additional processes e g uv h2o2 in us uv h2o2 mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 2 5 3 microwave the application of highly energetic radiation in the microwave range 300 mhz 300 ghz has been investigated for the oxidation of water contaminants microwaves have been used in combination with oxidants h2o2 or catalysts tio2 gac to assist in the destruction of organic pollutants han et al 2004 zhihui et al 2005 bo et al 2006 microwaves can enhance reaction rates and induce selective heating of the contaminants through internal molecule vibration additionally microwaves can generate uv radiation via an electrodeless discharge lamp for combined mw uv reactors unfortunately most of the applied microwave energy is converted into heat beside the low electrical efficiency eeo not readily available in literature cooling devices have to be employed to prevent treated water from overheating 2 5 4 electron beam the utilisation of ionizing radiation from an electron beam source 0 01 10 mev for water treatment has been tested since the 1980s the accelerated electrons penetrate the water surface and result in the formation of electronically excited species in the water including various ionic species and free radicals the maximum penetration depth of the accelerated electrons is directly proportional to the energy of the incident electrons e g 7 mm reported by nickelsen 1994 therefore water is irradiated in a thin film or as a sprayed aerosol this process exhibits a high oxidizing power and little interference by the water matrix and the electrical efficiency is within the feasibility range eeo 3 kwh m3 order for most contaminants bolton et al 1998 due to the high capital costs for an electron accelerator usually 1 million us the related risk potential from x rays and hence the necessary security measures further development of the electron beam process does not seem profitable 3 oxidation by products oxidation by product generation during the application of aops is a critical factor for process viability the abundance of nitrogen halogens and dissolved organic matter dom during disinfection of aops might lead to formation of organic halogenated by products such as total organic halides tox trihalomethanes thm haloacetic acids haa haloacetonitriles han and inorganic by products e g chlorate perchlorate and bromate all aops are based on radical oxidation paths however obp formation is diverse depending on radical type e g oh sulfate or chlorine radical radical exposure abundancy of other influencing water constituents e g radical scavengers and direct reactions of applied oxidants such as for instance ozone or chlorine occurrence and health risks of by products in drinking water as well as an overview of regulations and guidelines for specific disinfection by products is comprehensively reviewed richardson et al 2007 stalter et al 2016 while assessing the health risks from obps is challenging there is a general desire to minimize their formation thus in the following sections obp formation is discussed considering main reaction mechanisms divided into reactions with inorganic and organic compounds to identify opportunities to minimize their formation 3 1 reactions with inorganic compounds the oxyhalides chlorite chlorate perchlorate and bromate are potential inorganic by products of oxidation processes bromate bro3 which is regulated in drinking water worldwide can generally be formed in a pure oh reaction if br is abundant in the feed water von gunten and oliveras 1998 however this reaction is suppressed by dom lutze et al 2014 and in processes with excess h2o2 uv h2o2 fenton reaction where the oxidation of the intermediate hobr to bro3 is hindered by the fast reductive reaction with h2o2 to br k 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 von gunten 2003b therefore bro3 formation is negligible in most oh dominated systems chlorate and perchlorate formation during oh radical processes only occurs under certain conditions the initial reaction of oh radicals with cl is slow with a rate constant in the order of 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and formation of cl radicals can therefore be neglected at neutral conditions von gunten 2003b if oxidative chlorine species are abundant e g clo ocl however sequential oxidation by oh radicals to chlorate and perchlorate is possible in so4 based processes bro3 formation may be formed in a direct reaction of br with so4 kso4 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 redpath and willson 1975 in the absence of dom lutze et al 2014 in addition bro3 formation may occur from so4 reaction with cl to form oh and cl turning so4 based process into a cl and oh dominated process in some cases oh are directly formed on active surfaces e g the anode surface in eaops or the catalyst surface in heterogeneous caops and can only react within the diffusion limited zone of about 1 μm kapałka et al 2009 these conditions might induce high radical densities at the surface allowing kinetically unfavored oxidation of cl br and intermediate species forming bromate chlorate and perchlorate e g bergmann and rollin 2007 a detailed literature review on obp formation in eaops has recently been compiled by chaplin 2014 in ozone based aops at elevated bromide concentrations 100 μg l direct reaction of ozone can lead to 5 50 conversion of bromide to bromate depending on ozone exposure the fast decomposition of ozone in aops limits this reaction von gunten 2003a but significant bromate formation was still observed at elevated ozone dosages in the o3 h2o2 process hübner et al 2015 since chloride is not oxidized by ozone chlorate formation is only relevant for ozonation if pre oxidation by reactive chlorine species is applied von gunten 2003b as discussed above formation of chlorate perchlorate and bromate is not critical in uv based aops but other inorganic by products can be formed if dom containing water samples 10 mgc l are exposed to vacuum uv or lp uv irradiation h2o2 formation can reach up to 1 5 and 0 3 mg l respectively buchanan et al 2006 furthermore photolysis of nitrate may form nitrite during uv irradiation while the molar absorption coefficient of nitrate at λ 254 nm is low ε 4 m 1cm 1 it increases dramatically below 240 nm sharpless and linden 2001 revealing higher nitrite formation potentials for mp and vuv systems 3 2 reactions with organic compounds reactions of oh with dom generally involve hydrogen abstraction electrophilic addition and radical combination despite their electrophilic character these reactions are quite diverse and formation of significant obp concentrations was not observed in oh dominated oxidation processes for general water applications uv h2o2 for example was described as an aop without significant obp formation and no or minor increase of genotoxic activity if applied to surface water linden et al 2005 some studies however describe significant organic obp formation during uv h2o2 at high ph and cl concentrations 1 g l evaluated as adsorbable organic halides aox baycan et al 2007 despite the slow reactivity of oh with cl at high concentrations of cl formation of chlorine radicals cl cl2 and active chlorine species e g cl2 ocl hocl is sufficient these species can subsequently react with organic compounds by addition and substitution reactions resulting in halogenated obps oppenländer 2003 main formation paths of halogenated organic obps e g thm han and haa are based on reactions between oxoacids hypohalites hox ox and dom where the addition of halogens to dom increases following the order cl i br von gunten 2003b consequently uv chlorine process may involve formation of aox in contrast under mass transfer limited conditions organic obps are continuously generated bagastyo et al 2012 in ozone based aops the main pathway for generation of halogenated organic compounds is still the reaction of hox ox with dom as described above formation of bromo organic compounds 10 μg l depending on bromide concentration during raw surface water ozonation has been confirmed by huang et al 2005 since the oxidation of hoi and oi by ozone is fast ph 8 reaction of hoi with dom can be neglected for ozonation processes von gunten 2003b formation of hocl is not relevant for ozonation based on the low reactivity of ozone with chloride as described in section 4 1 1 resulting in a low relevance of chlorinated organic obps of higher concern is the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a highly carcinogenic substance mainly formed by chlorination of nitrogen and organic carbon containing waters some studies reported its occurrence after ozonation andrzejewski et al 2008 detailed reaction pathways for ndma formation during ozonation are proposed by yang et al 2009 however ndma is not a major by product of ozonation von gunten 2003b andrzejewski et al 2008 during uv chlorine ndma formation could be inhibited in a pilot scale system by quenching excess chlorine with thiosulfate sichel et al 2011 in uv based processes ndma is effectively removed by uv photolysis stefan and bolton 2002 mitch et al 2003 sharpless and linden 2003 other aops are less efficient removing ndma due to moderate and low second order rate constants with oh koh 3 8 108 m 1s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 and ozone ko3 0 052 m 1s 1 lee et al 2007 a common strategy to control ndma concentrations in water is the removal of precursors such as dimethylamine which can easily be oxidized by ozonation or aop lee et al 2007 however also subsequent biological steps are effective to mitigate ndma drewes et al 2006 recently researchers have shown the potential of mutagenic organic by product formation during application of medium pressure uv irradiation to water containing nitrate hofman caris et al 2015 kolkman et al 2015 the photolysis products of nitrate mainly peroxynitrite react with dom by hydroxylation nitration and nitrosation reactions forming organic obps martijn et al 2014 while potential reaction mechanisms have been proposed reckhow et al 2010 shah et al 2011 a comprehensive understanding has not yet been completed however nitrated aromatic compounds are expected to be the most toxic obps formed in this process martijn et al 2014 4 comparison of advanced oxidation processes eeo values derived for a specific aop are depending on the molecular structure the physico chemical characteristics such as specific reaction rate constants and the concentration range of the respective contaminant only if 1 mg l furthermore water matrix process capacity and energy independent process parameters e g oxidant or catalyst dose can have a significant influence on the efficiency of the process in general eeo values should only be determined for an aop which is optimized with respect to oxidant demand reactor geometry and other process specific parameters all these interdependencies should be kept in mind while comparing different aop technologies via eeo hence the boundary conditions in which eeo values were determined are very important for the overall comparison of aops via eeo it should be noted that additional energy demand for chemicals or catalysts is not reflected within this figure of merit the demand for auxiliary oxidants e g h2o2 however can be reflected within the eeo concept by regarding h2o2 as stored electric energy rosenfeldt et al 2006 for example müller et al 2001 calculated an equivalent of 10 kwh for 1 kg of h2o2 100 based on the commercial prices in germany however the majority of published eeo values are limited to the electricity which is directly used in the process e g for ozone generation or uv lamp operation several peer reviewed journal articles deal with the direct comparison of different aops in a defined experimental setup with controlled conditions i e in terms of water quality to be treated target contaminant and other process conditions with the aim to reveal the most efficient aop technology however many of these studies are lacking important information neglecting relevant parameters or testing removal of substances with specific reactivity to oxidants other than oh e g ozone reactive or photolytically degradable compounds furthermore comparison is only conducted in few water matrices and generalization of those results and their transfer to application with other water types contaminants etc should therefore be made with careful consideration of the respective conditions for this reason we critically reviewed and compared reported eeo values from different aops results are discussed and put in context to studies showing direct comparison if available in addition we analyzed major influencing factors on eeo determination based on literature data for the uv h2o2 process 4 1 comparative screening of eeo values for different aops eeo values for numerous aops from literature data are illustrated in fig 2 as box plots sorted according to their respective median values a summary of all data including specific information on water type system size and measured compounds is given at mendeley data https doi org 10 17632 n7h8kb4dfh 2 only data meeting the following criteria were included in the figure incorporated data is published in a peer reviewed process manufacturer data and data from non peer reviewed sources are included if detailed information about the experimental setup is given if kinetic data is available compounds which are susceptible to direct oxidation by e g ozone or uv photolysis will not be regarded threshold values for rate constants in o3 and uv based processes are set at ko3 10 m 1s 1 and kuv 10 5 m2 j data evaluation was conducted in three steps screening of eeo values single outlier detection and removal and descriptive statistics outlier detection was performed by the dixon test assuming log normal distribution for all data sets using an online tool available at http contchart com outliers aspx significance testing was performed using the two sample t test provided by another online tool http www evanmiller org ab testing t test html assuming log normal distribution for all data sets reported eeo values for individual aops often vary by several orders of magnitude in case of ozonation the strong variability might be explained by the dependence of radical formation from water matrix since it is only initiated by hydroxide ions at elevated ph or from ozone reactions with organic matter little variability of other processes might either indicate lower sensitivity to water quality and system design or limited experimental differences in literature data e g oxidation with microwaves was only tested in ultrapure water despite cases of high variability significant differences between aops can be observed from the literature study based on median values aops are classified in three groups processes with median eeo values 1 kwh m3 o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine and electron beam represent a realistic range for full scale application group 1 photo fenton plasma and eaop with median eeo values of 2 6 3 3 and 38 1 kwh m3 1 100 kwh m3 respectively are likely too energy intensive for most practical applications group 2 however they might still provide attractive solutions for specific challenges and full scale applicability of these processes should be further investigated eeo values for group 2 processes are significantly higher than values of group 1 p 0 045 processes with eéo values 100 kwh m3 i e uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops representing high median values of 335 2616 and 543 kwh m3 respectively are considered as not yet energy efficient aops significance of difference between group 2 and 3 is calculated as p 0 002 there are only few quality studies directly comparing processes from these different groups a direct comparison of uv h2o2 and bdd treatment for aniline removal from synthetic wastewater solutions confirmed lower eeo values for uv h2o2 by about 30 benito et al 2017 however extensive concentrations of h2o2 were applied in this study 1 5 g l that might have influenced calculated eeo values of uv h2o2 by re scavenging of oh by h2o2 observed differences between aops in the first group are statistically not significant p 0 2 in between all aops and most likely depend on experimental conditions this is confirmed by several studies comparing o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 sutherland and coworkers published a comprehensive evaluation of mtbe oxidation from five contaminated groundwaters with highly variable water quality characteristics sutherland et al 2004 depending on water type and adjusted ph either o3 h2o2 or uv h2o2 achieved lower eeo values in contrast lester et al 2011 reported lowest eéo values for o3 h2o2 followed by o3 uv h2o2 o3 uv o3 and uv for pharmaceutical degradation in phosphate buffer also müller et al 2001 showed advantages of the o3 h2o2 combination in comparison to uv h2o2 and uv o3 a recent study compared the efficiency of uv pds and uv h2o2 during iodoacids degradation considering most relevant influencing factors e g photo susceptibility and process capacity xiao et al 2016 special emphasis was directed to water matrix and oxidant dose effect results revealed higher energy efficiencies for the sulfate radical based aop by a factor of 3 however comparison of these processes using single compounds or specific compound groups needs to be evaluated carefully since sulfate radicals react more selectively than oh 4 2 principal influences on eeo values shown at the uv h2o2 process most boxplots for individual aops in fig 2 reveal high variances being mainly based on data variability considered in this review water quality process capacity and the selection of target chemicals are key parameters which may lead to large deviations of eeo values within one process effects of these factors is exemplarily illustrated in the following section using the dataset of uv h2o2 which is one of the most intensively investigated aops and therefore supplies high data density of eeo values n 149 excluding single outliers and data of photo susceptible compounds however transferability of influencing factors is not ensured for other aops since most influences are process specific 4 2 1 influence of process capacity eeo values from uv h2o2 studies conducted at laboratory pilot and full scale are illustrated in fig 3 median eeo values decrease with process capacity from 2 2 kwh m3 at lab scale to 0 68 and 0 5 kwh m3 for pilot and full scale applications respectively a significant difference could be observed p 0 05 between lab and pilot scale data the median values indicate that up scaling enhances energy efficiency which confirms the findings from bolton and stefan 2002 results furthermore emphasize that comparison of lab scale energy consumption not necessarily represents operation at full scale if possible energy demand should rather be estimated based on full scale system design with relevant operational parameters i e oxidant dosage uv fluence determined in standardized lab or pilot scale experiments 4 2 2 influence of compound reactivity energy efficiency of aops is also dependent on compound reactivity therefore gathered eeo values from reviewed uv h2o2 publications were correlated to second order rate constants koh of photo resistant target chemicals results indicated a slightly negative correlation r2 0 21 confirming that substances with higher koh values are more efficiently oxidized with a lower energy effort fig s1 however due to the low correlation coefficient the influence of other parameters e g process capacity is assumed to be higher 4 2 3 influence of water quality water quality mainly affects the uv h2o2 process by uv transmittance and radical scavengers therefore eeo values were investigated based on water characteristics reported from the respective article since numerous water types were included in all data gathered ranging from ultrapure lab water to industrial wastewater effluents eeo values were classified into main water application groups pure water drinking water groundwater and wastewater applications pure water applications include lab scale experiments with deionized and ultrapure water but also pilot scale applications with reverse osmosis permeate i e in water reuse drinking water applications summarize uv h2o2 processes with surface water after pre treatment with various process combinations groundwater applications include aops at contaminated sites as well as drinking water applications from groundwater wastewater consists of secondary and tertiary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants and industrial applications resulting eeo values of pure water drinking water groundwater and wastewater applications are presented in fig 4 as box plots median eeo values of each application were determined as 2 7 0 63 2 7 and 2 2 kwh m3 respectively however no significant difference could be observed between different groups p 0 05 the concentration of radical scavengers and uv absorbance uva are the most influential parameters for radical yield and radical oxidation efficiency consequently waters with higher scavenger concentrations and different scavenger composition and higher uva should result in higher eeo values surprisingly ultrapure water applications reveal the highest median eeo value in this comparison a possible explanation for this finding might be the predominant use of pure water in lab scale experiments which biases the illustration as already discussed in section 4 2 1 data comparison from drinking and wastewater applications reveal higher energy needs with increasing scavenger content especially doc and consequently uva are expected to be higher in this order in contrast to drinking water the median eeo value from groundwater applications is similar to wastewater oxidation groundwater may contain strongly variable inorganic concentrations e g alkalinity hco3 co3 2 but also reduced species like manganese and iron which might significantly scavenge oh radicals overall the operational classification of aops presented in fig 4 did not suggest any significant effects of water matrix on eeo values probably because the selected categories like pure water drinking water groundwater and wastewater are not specific enough and can include a wide range of different applications and water qualities therefore a direct correlation of water quality parameters with reported eeo values was also investigated considered as most relevant parameters doc uv transmittance and turbidity reported as ntu data were provided for 124 131 and 31 of the reviewed 147 data sets respectively a direct relationship within the reviewed data set between eeo values and doc concentrations uv transmittance or ntu however could not be revealed figs s2 and s3 4 2 4 influence of lamp type the influence of different lamp types on eeo values is illustrated in fig 5 mp uv lamps result in significantly higher eeo values compared to lp lamps p 0 001 the respective median values can be determined as 1 0 and 0 4 kwh m3 this is not surprising since the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 increases at wavelengths 260 nm and lp lamps depict higher 35 at 254 nm energy efficiencies than mp lamps 10 at 254 nm inevitably lp lamps yield in a higher h2o2 activation and consequently in lower eeo values this was also confirmed by rosenfeldt et al 2005 who directly compared lp and mp uv lamps for the oxidation of 2 methyl isoborneol 2 mib and geosmin raw blend surface water and filtered clearwell water were used in lab scale reactors eeo values revealed that lp lamps can be more energy efficient than mp lamps for oh generation 5 conclusions this study provides a critical review of different established and emerging aops including a mechanistic discussion of process specific by product formation to facilitate a comparison of energy efficiency data were collected for various aops in an extensive analysis of peer reviewed journal articles and critically compared based on reported eeo values despite high variability of results from individual processes significant differences between aops efficiency were observed based on reported eeo values processes were classified into 1 aops with median eeo values of 1 kwh m3 o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine electron beam 2 processes with median eeo values in the range of 1 100 kwh m3 photo fenton plasma and electrolytic aops and 3 uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops median eeo values of 100 kwh m3 which are considered as not yet energy efficient aops a more detailed evaluation of data for the uv h2o2 process showed highest impact of uv lamp type water matrix and process capacity lab scale vs pilot and full scale on resulting eeo values no significant correlation could be observed between eeo values and compound reactivity with oh radicals in addition reviewed literature indicates that by product formation from hydroxyl radicals is not critical unless formed at high density on surface areas e g in electrolytic aops however aops involving other oxidants such as ozone sulfate radicals or chlorine radicals need to be evaluated in more detail since site and process specific by products might be formed this study confirmed the main limitation to use the eeo concept for a general comparison of different aops due to the variability of the above mentioned influencing factors however if all factors are considered within a direct comparison the eeo concept provides a powerful figure of merit to directly compare and evaluate aops based on energy efficiency appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementray material

19553,occurrence of microplastics mps in the environment has attracted great attention as it has become a global concern this review aims to systematically demonstrate the role of marine microplastic as a novel medium for environmental partitioning of chemicals in the ocean which can cause toxic effects in the ecological environment this review assimilated and analyzed available data published between 1972 and 2017 on the interaction between mps and selected chemicals firstly the review analyzes the occurrence of chemicals in mps and outlines their distribution patterns then possible mechanisms of the interaction between mps and organic chemicals and potential controlling factors were critically studied finally the hazards of mps and affiliated organic chemicals to marine organisms were shortly summarized graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics toxic chemicals sorption mechanism distribution characteristics plastic pollution 1 introduction in recent years marine environment pollution has been attracting increased attention with the boom of marine activities particularly plastic pollution as lightweight strong versatile durable and affordable materials derraik 2002 laist 1987 plastics have been heavily used as basic constituents for a variety of commercial and consumer products andrady 2011 bockhorn et al 1999 roy et al 2011 teuten et al 2009 however the disposal of plastic products has caused heavy pollution to the marine environment laist 1987 pruter 1987 plastic is a main component of marine trash occupying about 60 80 in some areas up to 95 of ocean garbage derraik 2002 gregory and ryan 1997 moore 2008 the so called microplastics mps or plastic pellets have been detected in various oceanic compartments including surface seawater water column and sediment claessens et al 2011 derraik 2002 hammer et al 2012 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 obbard et al 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 as well as beaches estuaries remote islands and polar regions barnes et al 2009 gregory and ryan 1997 thompson et al 2004 while their definitions may vary andrady 2011 mps are generally categorized as plastic particles with effective diameters less than 5 mm which are usually cylinder or disk shaped barnes et al 2009 betts 2008 dubaish and liebezeit 2013 liebezeit and dubaish 2012 thompson et al 2009 turra et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 according to the different shapes of mps they can be mainly divided into fragments foams granules and fibers tsang et al 2017 because the degradation rate of mps is quite low andrady 2011 bakir et al 2014 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 mps can accumulate and concentrate in the oceans via various routes such as mechanical physical chemical and biological actions carpenter et al 1972 thompson et al 2004 2005 microplastics can be derived from primary and or secondary sources andrady 2011 primary sources mainly include additives used to increase friction in consumer products such as cosmetic and facial care products or hand cleaners and toothpaste andrady 2011 browne et al 2011 carr et al 2016 cole et al 2011 fendall and sewell 2009 gregory 1996 wang et al 2016 zitko and hanlon 1991 medical supplies such as grinding polishing agents used in dental teeth and capsules as vectors for inclusion of drugs patel et al 2009 overflowing drilling fluid in oil exploration industrial abrasives and air blast cleaning media gregory 1996 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 secondary sources are large plastics degraded to small particles through physical chemical and biological processes browne et al 2007 microplastics are ubiquitously distributed in the marine environment accounting for approximately 92 of global marine plastic debris eriksen et al 2014 because of their minute sizes mps are difficult to identify and can be easily ingested by aquatic organisms microplastics have larger specific surface area than large plastic particles so they may sorb much more organics lee et al 2014 the kinetic of chemical sorption on mp is important for their fate and transportation guo et al 2012 showed that the sorption of four hydrophobic organic compounds on three polymers reached equilibrium within 6 days in oceans the equilibrium will changed from time to time as gyres are still in a kinetic phase the chemicals in the mps also exchanged with the surrounding media as mps can be transferred with very long distance such as the arctic and the north pacific gyre under the action of wind and ocean currents rios mendoza and jones 2015 zarfl and matthies 2010 for most case it was proposed that the equilibration was reached in short time scales when analyzing chemical concentrations in mps moreover the sorption behavior of chemicals on mps is related to plastic types color and other physical and chemical properties e g size and chemical composition endo et al 2005 discolored mps have been reported to adsorb more pcbs than non discolored ones and polyethylene pe generally exhibits a greater sorption capacity to environmental pollutants than other plastic types alimi et al 2017 and the presence of other sorbents is also important according to koelmans et al 2016 and lohmann 2017 the total organic contaminant fraction absorbed by plastic is much smaller than that adsorbed by other media like dissolved organic carbon and colloids in the ocean seidensticker et al 2017 experimentally found that the concentration of dissolved organic matter could change the distribution of contaminants between the mp and water in addition the increase of mp concentration would increase adsorption of chemicals the sorption of chemicals on mps may transfer harmful substances such as persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt chemicals into the food chain bakir et al 2012 carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 mato et al 2001 rochman et al 2013b rockstrom et al 2009 rothstein 1973 zitko and hanlon 1991 which would seriously endanger marine life and ecological environment however some critical papers regarding the transfer potential of mp didn t draw the conclusion that mp is an important transport carrier or a vector to marine organism beckingham and ghosh 2017 gouin et al 2011 koelmans et al 2013 as the number of studies regarding mps and affiliated chemicals has considerably increased in recent years it is useful to examine the sorption mechanisms between mps and organic chemicals and identify research gaps and directions the objectives of this review are to 1 summarize the types of organic chemicals preferably affiliated to mps 2 analyze the occurrence of these chemicals in mps and outline their distribution patterns 3 examine possible mechanisms of the interaction between mps and the organic chemicals and potential controlling factors and 4 discuss the hazards of mps and affiliated organic chemicals to marine organisms 2 data assimilation and analysis peer reviewed journal articles related to mps in web of science published between 1972 and 2017 were assimilated and analyzed the reported concentrations of mps in the environment river seawater and sediment are extracted and summarized in table s1 total concentrations of 13pcb sum of pcb 66 101 110 149 118 105 153 138 128 187 180 170 and 206 ddt sum of ddt dde and ddd and hch sum of α hch β hch γ hch and δ hch on plastic pellets were calculated and divided into major cities small cities remote areas and remote islands fig 1 concentrations of main chemicals in cities of australia and new zealand were averaged using median concentrations from different sampling sites chemical concentrations in cities of portugal and remote islands were based on reporting median data from two selected articles fig 2 and fig s3 were drawn based on the reported concentrations of different chemicals on mps with different colors black aged white and colored fig 3 outlined median concentration of some selected congeners or isomers of target chemicals on mps based on data from three different countries china greece and portugal to study the temporal distribution of chemicals on mps data from two related papers were summarized in fig 4 to compare changes of chemical levels with time table s5 outlined partition coefficients of various chemicals in different types of plastic polymers from 12 selected studies the correlation between the octanol water partition coefficient log kow and the equilibrium partitioning coefficient between polymer and seawater or water log kpolymer sw log kpolymer w of the chemicals through the relevant regression analysis are also demonstrated in fig 5 kpolymer sw was calculated using partitioning ratios as follows 1 kpolymer sw kpolymersm kpdmssm kpdmssw where kpolymersm and kpdmssm are partition coefficients between polymer and solvent mixture and between pdms and solvent mixture respectively 3 microplastics and adhered chemicals 3 1 spatial variability fig 1 shows concentrations of 13pcb ddt and hch on plastic pellets from major cities small cities remote areas and remote islands it is clear that concentrations of pcbs ddts and hchs in mps collected from large cities such as sydney auckland and lisbon were almost an order of magnitude higher than those from small cities e g tauranga in new zealand or remote areas e g kimberley in australia and were almost two orders of magnitude greater than those on remote islands e g oahu kahuku beach oahu wawamalu beach in us heskett et al 2012 mizukawa et al 2013 yeo et al 2015 fig s2 shows the concentrations of pcbs ddts hchs and pahs in plastic pellets from four different places in greece karapanagioti et al 2011 the concentrations of all detected chemicals in pellets from loutropyrgo beach and aegena island were much higher than those from kato achaia beach and vatera island it is well known that the saronikos gulf is a polluted place as loutropyrgo and aegena are located at the saronikos gulf gómez gutiérrez et al 2007 galanopoulou et al 2005 kato achaia and vatera are located on the non polluted patras gulf karapanagioti et al 2011 likewise there are regional differences in the chemical concentrations detected on the mps pahs in mps found on the sandy beach were also analyzed and the results showed that pahs on the mps sediments in different depths had different concentrations and surface layer had the highest pah levels fisner et al 2013a 2013b apparently levels of chemicals adhered to plastic pellets are related to the regional levels of industrialization endo et al 2005 heskett et al 2012 hirai et al 2011 hosoda et al 2014 karapanagioti et al 2011 mato et al 2001 2002 mizukawa et al 2013 yeo et al 2015 the concentration of pollutants is also related to the abundance of mps 3 2 color difference plastic pellets are divided into four categories black aged white and colored fig 2 summarizes the levels of pcbs pahs and ddts on plastic pellets with different colors from ten beaches along the portuguese coast matosinhos espinho mira vieira de leiria paredes de vitoria peniche cresmina fonte da telha sines and bordei antunes et al 2013 fig s3 shows the total concentrations of pcbs pahs and ddts in each color fraction in alcobaça portugal frias et al 2013 aged and black pellets contained higher pcb and pah concentrations than colored and white ones fig 2 a 2 b and s3 on the other hand ddt concentrations were similar in black colored and white pellets but not aged ones fig 2 c and s3 overall aged and black pellets had higher concentrations of pcbs and pahs than white and colored pellets especially yellowing pellets antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2010 2013 rios et al 2007 aged pellets are yellowing ones that have been present for a long time in the oceans and with a high state of degradation sorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants to microplastic includes not only adsorption to surfaces but also absorption into particles their long residence time would increase the sorption concentration of chemicals on mps while degradation would increase their specific surface areas further increasing their sorption capacities antunes et al 2013 endo et al 2005 frias et al 2013 karapanagioti and klontza 2008 mato et al 2001 ogata et al 2009 and longer residence time allows diffusion of hydrophobic organic pollutants deeper into plastic particles from contaminated water these are the main reasons why aged pellets can sorb much more chemicals than other tinctorial pellets some researchers hold the opposite view that originally absorbed chemicals might be released to less polluted water during the migration and hence the concentration may decrease thus the effect of prolonged stay in the surrounding water environment on the sorption and desorption of pollutants by aged microplastic is dependent on the chemical levels of the water environment another reason is that black granules basically consist of polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp materials while aging particles are usually made up of pp and pe materials cavani and trifirò 1995 frias et al 2010 with regards to plastic materials pe usually has higher sorption affinities than other plastic polymers towards organic chemicals followed by pp and ps karapanagioti and klontza 2007 2008 karapanagioti et al 2010 teuten et al 2007 there are also some other potential reasons for example polyurethane pu was identified as a constituent of black pellets occasionally which may increase their ability to sorb chemicals antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2013 zia et al 2007 pigmented particles may also contain some colored additives such as pigments that make it easier to sorb chemicals from surrounding seawater frias et al 2013 the reason for pigments favour sorption is the organic contents taken from plants and animals can promote sorption capacity compared to black and aged particles white pellets sorb significantly less amounts of chemicals due to their translucent characteristic frias et al 2013 white pellets are often present in seawater for a short time resulting in low sorption and small specific surface areas endo et al 2005 frias et al 2010 ogata et al 2009 the above results explain why black and aged particles can sorb higher concentrations of chemicals than colored and white particles however endo et al 2005 suggested that the degree of aging in particles had no association with sorption of pcbs they argued that plastic aging occurs after stranding on the beach rather than in seawater while plastic sorption of chemicals occurs in seawater endo et al 2005 gregory 1983 3 3 congeners or isomers in addition to the total concentrations of the target chemicals in mps presented above these chemicals also include different congeners or isomers fig 3 depicts levels of pcb congeners pah isomers hch isomers and ddt metabolites in plastic pellets ng g 1 pellet from three different countries china greece and portugal karapanagioti et al 2011 mizukawa et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 generally concentrations of pcbs hchs and ddts on plastic pellets from china were lower than those from greece and portugal while pah concentrations in china were higher the results also showed that pcb 110 was the most abundant congener among all pcbs in china followed by pcb 138 and pcb 170 while pcb 138 pcb 153 pcb 170 pcb 180 and pcb 187 were predominant in greece and portugal fig 3 a as many countries began to reduce or stop pcb production after 1973 the occurrence of pcbs in these three countries may be a result of past pollution to be specific in the past these chemicals were released into water and accumulated in the water column and sediment and was later released to the environment however pcb concentrations on plastics were much higher in polluted areas and large cities which were probably related to industrial activities from their surroundings in addition heavily chlorinated congeners were enriched in mps especially hexa chlorinated pcbs pcb 138 and pcb 153 and hepta chlorinated pcbs pcb 187 180 and 170 this indicates that either heavily chlorinated congener has high ambient concentrations in the environment or plastic particles have strong tendency to sorb such homologues this question requires further study for pah isomers the concentrations of phenanthrene phe and chrysene chr were dominant in all three countries especially in china in rural cities from portugal fluoranthene fla phe and pyrene pyr were the most prevalent pah components while phe indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ipy and benzo ghi perylene bghip were dominant in large cities fig 3 b budzinski et al 1997 and boonyatumanond et al 2006 suggested that high ring 4 6 rings pahs were derived mainly from fossil fuels and incomplete combustion of organic matter in contrast low ring pahs 2 3 rings are derived mostly from petroleum products such as gasoline and lubricant oils apparently pahs on plastic pellets may have derived from both combustion of fossil fuels and petroleum residues due to the proximity to large oil and gas electric power plants rural cities of portugal mainly contained low ring pahs mizukawa et al 2013 and it can clearly see from fig 3 b that the concentration of high ring pahs on mps in qinhuangdao is much higher than that in dalian which is because there is a china s largest transportation port of coal near the sampling site the main source of pahs may have been the combustion of fossil fuels at other sampling sites the concentrations of hchs and ddts in mps were relatively higher at polluted sites or large cities except for hchs in portugal in greece γ hch was the most abundant hch isomer followed by δ hch while γ hch and δ hch were the main isomers in portugal fig 3 c hchs are commonly used legacy pesticides the γ isomer also known as lindane has the only insecticidal effect and the most rapid degradation rate followed by α and δ isomers with the β isomer extremely recalcitrant willett et al 1998 this is an important reason why γ hch is the main isomer found in mps hchs especially γ hch were mainly used for insect control on fruits and vegetables rice and seed treatment which is also the main reason why hchs mostly occurred in rural areas another possibility is that plastic particles have higher affinity with γ hch than β hch or δ hch ziccardi et al 2016 experimentally measured partition coefficients of γ hch are consistently greater than those of β and δ hch using pe pp and ps debris lee et al 2014 which also supports such argument the ddt products have played a significant role in preventing agricultural diseases and pests and reducing malaria typhoid fever and other mosquito borne diseases for the first half of the 20th century the major ddt compounds p p ddt p p ddd and p p dde have been detected in mps from both rural and urban areas while urban areas generally have higher ddt concentrations than rural areas mizukawa et al 2013 fig 3 d the use of ddts as pesticides in nearby catchments may be attributed to the higher concentrations of ddts in cities 3 4 temporal trends fig 4 shows temporal characteristics of various chemicals in plastic particles collected from south africa and vietnam from fig 4 it is clear that plastic particles associated chemical concentrations in these places have overall declined more specifically pcb and ddt concentrations in plastic pellets decreased markedly from 2007 to 2014 in the minh chau island vietnam and from 2008 to 2014 in the balat estuary while hch levels had a slight decrease le et al 2016 the same trend was also observed in plastic samples collected from south african beaches ryan et al 2012 however a slight increase of pcb and ddt concentrations occurred at west coast park in the western cape province of south africa from 1999 to 2008 and at woody cape in the eastern cape province from 1994 to 2005 concentrations of chemicals in the environment will theoretically be reduced over time if the source is controlled chemicals in the environment will gradually degrade with time although the degradation process can be very slow the decreasing trends in vietnam from 2007 to 2014 and on three south african beaches from 1984 to 2005 and from 1989 to 2008 are consistent with this assumption the main reason is the ban of pcb and ddt usage since 1970 which has been effective to reduce environmental sources of these chemicals ryan et al 2012 however the slight increase of pcb and ddt levels at west coast park from 1999 to 2008 and woody cape from 1994 to 2005 may be due to analytical uncertainties as well as the roles of contaminant reservoir such as contaminated sediments according to ryan et al 2012 the increase may be due to the underestimation of the pcb concentrations on plastic samples in 1999 and by re suspension of sediment during industrial activities 4 the interaction between microplastics and chemicals microplastics are known to sorb pbt compounds from surrounding water which may further act as carriers or vectors to transport these chemicals to biota bakir et al 2012 2014 bowmer and kershaw 2010 brennecke et al 2016 endo et al 2005 hirai et al 2011 holmes et al 2014 mato et al 2001 rios et al 2007 teuten et al 2007 2009 nevertheless beckingham and ghosh 2017 gouin et al 2011 and koelmans et al 2013 draw the inverse conclusion that mp is not an important transport vector of chemicals recent study of chen et al 2018 showed that plastic might have a role to play in the transfer of chemicals to certain marine organisms if the gradient of plastic to predators is present furthermore chemical concentration in mps might be even up to 105 to 106 times greater than that in ambient seawater mato et al 2001 rios et al 2010 takada 2006 wurl and obbard 2004 ziccardi et al 2016 however fugacity gradient is proportional to cpolymer kpolymer sw cw thus the debated results lead to comprehensive summary of current study on the interaction between chemicals and mps 4 1 the effects of hydrophobicity kow table s5 shows partition coefficients of different chemicals derived from linear kd and freundlich kf models octanol water partition coefficients kow and polymer water partitioning coefficients in seawater kpolymer sw and water kpolymer w the equation for the linear model is as follows 2 kd qe solid ce aq where qe is the amount of contaminant sorbed onto plastic ug kg 1 at equilibrium and ce is the contaminant concentration in the aqueous phase at equilibrium ug l 1 the equation for the freundlich model is as follows 3 log qe log kf 1 nf log ce where qe ug kg 1 is the concentration of the contaminant on the solid phase at equilibrium ce ug l 1 contaminant concentration in the aqueous phase at equilibrium kf l kg 1 is the multilayer adsorption capacity and 1 nf is the freundlich exponent and an indicator of the site energy distribution of a sorbent ie sorbent heterogeneity increases as n decreases the equation for polymer water partitioning coefficients in seawater or water is as follows 4 kpolymer sw kpol ymersm kpdmssm kpdmssw where kpolymersm and kpdmssm are partition coefficients between polymer and solvent mixture and between pdms and solvent mixture respectively kpdmssw is partition coefficient between pdms and seawater from fig 5 a the hydrophobicity kow is generally in the order of hchs pcbs ddts pahs it is clear that the log kow log kd or log kf of ddt log kow 6 79 log kd 4 99 4 31 log kf 5 9 on pe is generally higher than that of phe log kow 4 6 log kd 4 71 4 08 kf 4 6 0 12 similarly the value of log kow log kd or log kf of ddt 6 79 5 02 4 18 5 4 on poly vinyl chloride pvc is also greater than that of phe 4 6 3 36 2 81 3 3 table s5 fig 5 b shows that the partition coefficients kpolymer sw and kpolymer w of chemicals on different types of mps have a strong relationship with the kow of chemicals which is in accordance with ziccardi et al 2016 for the fitting curves in fig 5 b the values of adj r square of logkpe w logkpe sw logkpp sw and logkps sw with log kow are 0 97 0 92 0 93 and 0 83 respectively the fitting results of logkpe w and kow are the best followed by logkpp sw and logkpe sw and the worst is logkps sw generally the fitting result can successfully indicate the relationship between log k and log kow however the log kf of dehp is lower than that of ddt while the log kow and log kd of the former chemical is higher this may indicate that the sorption of dehp is more consistent with the freundlich isotherm model in fig 5 a the log kd or log kf values of dehp and ddt were all higher than those of phe and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa which suggests the same plastic materials sorb more dehp and ddt than phe and pfoa it needs to point out that pfoa usually carries ionic charges in aquatic environment which is also the reason of lower sorption the log kd or log kf values of phe ddt pfoa and dehp on pe are apparently higher than on those on pvc this suggests that pe has a higher affinity with most chemicals than pvc for example teuten et al 2007 showed that pe particles can sorb and accumulate more organic chemicals than other plastics like pp and pvc pellets from fig 5 a the values of log kpe w for pah isomers follow the order bghip benzo a pyrene bap benz k fluoranthene bkf chr benz a anthracene baa pyrene pyr fla anthracene ant fluorene flu acenaphthene acp naphthalene nap such a finding illustrates that pe sorbs more high ring 4 6 rings pahs than low ring pahs 2 3 rings in aquatic environment as larger high ring pahs are more hydrophobic similarly pp and ps show higher affinities towards high ring pahs than with low ring pahs the log kd or log kf for pcbs pahs hchs and ddts on pe in water are in the range of 4 19 6 88 2 81 7 27 2 2 2 8 and 4 22 5 77 and the log kow for pcbs pahs hchs and ddts are as followed 5 11 7 88 3 00 6 35 3 55 4 14 and 6 79 ddt table s5 these findings indicate that pahs pcbs and ddts can partition to mps more readily than hchs frias et al 2013 hirai et al 2011 karapanagioti et al 2011 as for log kpe sw log kpp sw or log kps sw the value for α hch is greater than that of other hch isomers followed by γ hch δ hch and β hch fig 5 a this suggests plastic has a higher affinity with α hch and γ hch than δ hch and β hch in seawater when comparing log kpe sw log kpp sw and log kps sw of hch isomers it is clear that hch could partition more on ps than on pp and pe for pah isomers the values of log kpe sw and log kps sw are similar while the log kpp sw is relatively low generally log kd or log kf values in seawater are higher than in water such as the log kpe sw of pahs is greater than their log kpe w however the log kpe sw 5 22 of hexachlorobenzene is slightly lower than log kpe w 5 43 table s5 it suggests that salinity is an important factor influencing the partition behavior bakir et al 2014 as discussed further below 4 2 the materials of microplastics it is well known that mps have different types colors sizes and compositions the most common types of mps in the marine environment are pe and pp ps and pvc endo et al 2005 it was reported that organic chemicals were easily sorbed on mps due to their hydrophobic nature takada 2006 many other studies observed that chemicals usually had higher diffusion coefficients on low density mps than high density mps fries and zarfl 2012 karapanagioti and klontza 2008 lee et al 2018 mato et al 2001 2002 teuten et al 2007 it should be attributed to the slower diffusion rate of chemicals on high density mps for example the sorption of perfluorooctane sulphonate pfos and perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa on pe and pvc was reported to be greater than on ps wang et al 2015 while the partition coefficient of phe on pe was an order of magnitude higher than that of pp followed by pvc teuten et al 2007 polyethylene has generally been reported to exhibit greater adsorption capacity than other types of plastics alimi et al 2017 the distribution order of chemical substances on various types of plastic were ldpe hdpe pp pvc ps o connor et al 2016 where pvc and ps are glassy polymers with the glass transition temperature tg at 80 c is higher than normal ambient temperature resulting in low mobility of the polymer and low diffusivity of the penetrant these findings showed the sorption of chemicals was related to the type of plastics lee et al 2014 rochman et al 2013a previous studies showed concentrations of chemicals such as pcbs and pahs on black and aged plastic pellets were much higher than those on white and colored ones antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2010 2013 rios et al 2007 black plastic pellets may have more additives like pu than white pellets which may enhance the sorption level frias et al 2013 the size of plastic particles is also an important factor table s6 shows some physical characteristics and partition coefficients for sorption of phe on various polymers teuten et al 2007 it is clear that pe pp and pvc of the same size ranging from 200 μm to 250 μm had different bet surface areas and distribution coefficients table s6 showed that the log kd of pe log kd 4 58 3 75 was greater than pp log kd 3 34 2 23 and pvc log kd 3 22 2 30 which was attributed to the larger surface area of pe than pp and pvc plastic particles with smaller sizes had a higher surface area for sorption than larger particles and larger one also had longer distance for chemical diffusion than smaller one when the equilibrium is reached lee et al 2014 seidensticker et al 2017 for example the distribution coefficients of nano plastics log kd 5 82 5 23 were much higher than that of mps log kd 4 23 3 04 ma et al 2016 such findings indicated that the particle size of plastics was not only crucial for organic chemical sorption but also for equilibration times velzeboer et al 2014 the four common types of plastics pe pp pvc and ps at a given environmental temperature can be divided into two categories rubbery plastics pe and pp and glassy plastics pvc and ps which are also connected to the tg alimi et al 2017 kurtz 2004 teuten et al 2009 teuten et al 2009 reported that a certain polymer can transit from a rubbery state to a glassy state when it cools below its tg some studies showed that rubbery plastics such as pe and pp had a higher affinity with chemicals than glassy plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate pet and pvc guo et al 2012 rochman et al 2013a wu et al 2001 george and thomas 2001 proposed that glassy polymers have a more dense structure with little void space and present higher cohesive forces while rubbery polymers exhibit a large amount of free volume between molecules and present greater mobility and flexibility glassy polymers have long lived and closed internal nano scale pores due to their rigidity that act as adsorption sites such structures lead to a higher sorption level of chemicals and slower diffusion rate in glassy polymers than rubbery plastics teuten et al 2009 the phenomenon is reflected in the intrapolymer diffusion coefficients as well specifically the diffusion coefficients of organic compounds in ps pvc are lower than in pe chen et al 2018 seidensticker et al 2017 in general rubbery plastics small particulate plastic particles and black plastic pellets likely sorb more chemicals 4 3 the degree of weathering aging effect as mentioned in the previous section the aging of plastics increased its ability to sorb chemicals endo et al 2005 ogata et al 2009 rios et al 2007 aged plastic has a greater state of degradation mainly due to long term photooxidation seawater corrosion friction or other processes brennecke et al 2016 eriksson and burton 2003 photooxidation and friction made large plastic pieces exposed to uv light decompose into mps thereby increasing specific surface areas and surface roughness of mps which further increase their sorption capacities furthermore pérez et al 2010 indicated that the aging process led to a decrease in the molecular weight of the polymer which indirectly affects its sorbent properties another phenomenon was to use beach plastic particles as passive samplers to monitor the concentrations of chemicals in marine environment ogata et al 2009 takada 2006 rummel et al 2017 showed that biofilm plastic interactions have the ability to affect the fate and impact of mps by increasing the specific surface area and equilibration times in summary the effect of weathering aging on plastics would enhance the sorption capacity of chemicals due to a higher specific surface area the surface coverage of organic matter and so on 4 4 the influence of salinity as shown in table s5 the log kpe sw and log kpe w of the same chemical are slightly different for most pahs the log kpe sw is slightly greater than log kpe w while log kpe sw of hexachlorobenzene and α hch is lower than log kpe w while it would be expected that the salting out effect would provide a greater fugacity to drive dissolved neutral organic compounds to sorb to mps this does not explain the latter observed decreases studies exist the effect of salinity on sorption and desorption between plastics and chemicals adams et al 2007 bakir et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 wang et al 2015 but further investigations are needed to elucidate such an effect table s7 shows the corresponding log kf for the sorption of phe and ddt onto pvc and pe over a series of salinity gradients and desorption rate k day 1 sd in pure milliq water 0 psμ and in seawater 35 psμ adopted from bakir et al 2014 salinity for test included 0 8 8 17 5 26 3 and 35 psμ practical salinity scale unit corresponding to 0 25 50 75 100 of seawater respectively there was no significant change in the partition coefficient log kf of pvc phe pe phe pvc ddt and pe ddt with the increase in salinity it can be seen that the desorption rate between plastic and chemical in milliq water was a bit inferior to that in seawater the desorption rate between plastic and ddt is distinctly less than that of plastic phe according to wang et al 2015 salinity increase would increase the sorption capacity of pfos on pe but had no evident impact on fosa sorption the same study also found that pfos in pure water cannot be sorbed on ps pellets but sorbed on ps particles at high salt concentrations these observations all indicate that the sorption of pfos on mps was much easier in seawater than in water for the effects of salt on partition coefficients lohmann et al 2012 used the setschenow equation to calculate the effect of dissolved salts on the ksw of nonpolar compounds the equation was as follows 5 logksw logksw 0 ksi where ksw is the sampler water partition coefficient i is the ionic strength in moles per liter ks is the setschenow constant in liters per mole and ksw 0 is the sampler water partition coefficient at an ionic strength of 0 4 5 the impacts of ph and temperature at present there are a few reports about the impact of solution chemistry on the chemical sorption on mps the ph of solution should theoretically affect ionic chemicals sorption on mp due to the electrostatic interaction the study of wang et al 2015 showed that the sorption of pfos on pe and ps particles increases with a decrease in ph while neither had an effect on the sorption of neutral fosa on these plastics such findings may suggest that properties of mps and chemicals strongly influence the sorption process table s8 shows log kpe w values of some chemicals at different temperatures the log kpe w of phe increases with increasing temperature from 18 to 24 c 4 2 at 18 c 4 23 0 02 at 23 c and 4 3 0 1 at 24 c but was slightly lower at 30 c 4 16 0 02 than at 24 c pyr presents a similar trend as phe with a log kpe w value of 4 62 at 16 4 18 7 c which is smaller than those at 23 c 5 02 0 03 and 24 c 5 0 0 1 however it slightly decreased when temperature reached 30 c 4 90 0 01 for most hocs e g phe fla pyr chr and benzo e pyrene bep log kpe w values at 30 c were less than those at 24 c pcb 52 is an exception with log kpe w at 30 c being slightly higher than that at 23 c the study of lohmann et al 2012 showed that partition coefficient ksw for chlorobenzenes pcbs pahs and dde on plastics appears to be essentially temperature independent possibly with the exception of phe 5 microplastics and marine organisms at present mps had been found in a large number of marine organisms gall and thompson 2015 as they mistake and swallow tiny mps as food and transfer them to their food chains cole et al 2013 lusher et al 2013 it was estimated that 693 species in 2015 had been affected by marine plastic pollution while 267 species were recorded to have marine plastic debris in their bodies gall and thompson 2015 for example plastic fragments or mps were identified in the guts stomachs and tissues of marine organisms such as seabirds blight and burger 1997 fishes collard et al 2015 miranda and de carvalho souza 2016 turtles bjorndal et al 1994 whales fossi et al 2012 tarpley and marwitz 1993 crabs watts et al 2016 and even the alimentary tract of gudgeons gobio gobio sanchez et al 2014 table s9 shows the spatial distribution of mps in several aquatic organisms from different areas the amount of mps in bivalves was reported to range from 4 3 to 57 2 items individual of a chinese fishery market li et al 2015 in addition the number of plastic fibers found was up to 178 items individual in mytilus edulis from canada mathalon and hill 2014 while the levels of mps 0 03 0 18 items individual in demersal fish from the north sea and baltic sea were approximately four orders of magnitude lower than that in mytilus edulis rummel et al 2016 thus the plastic debris in the ocean is not only a kind of global environmental pollution problem but also brings potential harms to marine organisms plastic debris is related to the injury of organism derraik 2002 gregory 2009 and may even lead to sub vital and mortality effects on individuals browne et al 2015 cole and galloway 2015 the harm of plastic fragments to marine life is mainly manifested in physical chemical and biological effects with regards to physical aspects plastic debris has a direct mechanical effect on marine creatures through entanglement and ingestion for example large plastic debris or fragments block the passage of food and affect appetite and can even cause intestinal perforation and reproductive impairment derraik 2002 gregory 2009 moore 2008 wilcox et al 2015 to be specific plastic debris particularly synthetic fibers swallowed by animals may cause a false feeling of satiation or lead to internal blockage or damage to the digestive system all these effects would then reduce food intake and affect digestion and finally cause starvation and death duis and coors 2016 foekema et al 2013 hjelmeland et al 1988 jackson et al 2000 ryana 1988 wright et al 2013 according to von moos et al 2012 ingested plastic particles may stay in the alimentary canal and cause internal wear and inflammation predation further transfers mps into the food chains for example pelagic zooplankton are more susceptible to microplastic uptake which indirectly causes serious harm to the food chain due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of microplastics and chemicals cole and galloway 2015 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 moore 2008 another example is the blue mussel mytilus edulis they can ingest and transport microplastic particles to the gut which then accumulate in the digestive cavity and tubules browne et al 2008 overall the physical harm of mps are to cause injury after ingesting plastic fragments affect the digestive system and even cause starvation donohue et al 2001 but one important factor is that the mp concentrations in these lab experiments were orders of magnitude higher than those which can be found in the environment such physical injuries of mp should only occur with mp heavily polluted areas with regards to chemical aspects mps indirectly affect the organism because they can sorb and concentrate harmful chemicals from the surroundings and transport these chemicals into organisms mato et al 2001 teuten et al 2007 2009 as mentioned earlier mps or plastic fragments could be an importance transport route or vector for chemicals into the marine food web bakir et al 2012 chemicals sorbed on the surface of mps and plasticizers or additives released from plastics can enter the organism with the particles and could be released through desorption processes to cause effects such as lesions to the organism and ultimately to humans bakir et al 2014 cole et al 2011 farrell and nelson 2013 neves et al 2015 watts et al 2014 according to ryana 1988 the amount of ingested plastic particles had a positive correlation with the concentrations of pcbs in the adipose tissues of great shearwaters puffinus gravis in addition mps have a larger surface area than plastic debris which make them more accessible to sorb organic chemicals and plasticizers from surrounding seawater lee et al 2014 microplastics are also small enough to enter the living body while large plastic fragments can be blocked without a hitch thus mps may potentially cause greater damage than large plastic fragments to creatures in marine environment mohamed nor and obbard 2014 chemicals absorbed to mps such as pcbs and those released from mps such as bpa have carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic effects on organisms zhang et al 2016 however some researchers are still controversial about the vector function of mps according to gouin et al 2011 and beckingham and ghosh 2017 the transfer of organic contaminants into biological organisms by dietary mps may be a small or limited contribution compared to other natural routes of exposure in most cases therefore mps can introduce these harmful chemicals into organisms only when fugacity of a chemical in microplastics is greater than that in organism which may result in an exposure risk with regards to biological aspects mps may become gathering places for some microorganisms this will introduce new or non native species into other areas through transport of plastic debris by ocean currents and wind patterns such as bryozoans barnes 2002 derraik 2002 last but not least mps indirectly have a harmful effect on human health bivalves such as mussels m edulis and oysters crassostrea gigas are popular seafood in which mps have been discovered in both farmed and wild bivalves mathalon and hill 2014 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 therefore humans at the top of the food chain may be subject to potential health risks after the consumption of seafood polluted by mps and toxic chemicals seltenrich 2015 in summary the mps in the ocean not only cause marine environmental pollution issues affecting marine biodiversity but also have a potential of causing harmful effects on marine organisms and humans gall and thompson 2015 6 conclusions this review analyzes the distribution characteristics of chemicals on mps and discusses the sorption behavior between mps and chemicals chemicals adhered to mps sampled from larger cities or highly industrialized areas are higher than that in smaller cities or remote areas in addition chemicals sorbed on black or aged mps are at a greater concentration than that on colored or white mps furthermore chemical levels on mps will also be reduced due to the prohibition on use of some organic chemicals and to the degradation of chemicals these results are related to the sorption mechanisms between mps and chemicals which are mainly controlled by the physical chemical properties of mps nature of chemicals temperature and solution chemistry finally mps may enter the body of organisms through ingestion enter the food chain via predation and eventually reach the human bodies they can cause hazardous effects on ecological and human health this review article calls for public attention on microplastic pollution from a scientific viewpoint acknowledgements this

19553,occurrence of microplastics mps in the environment has attracted great attention as it has become a global concern this review aims to systematically demonstrate the role of marine microplastic as a novel medium for environmental partitioning of chemicals in the ocean which can cause toxic effects in the ecological environment this review assimilated and analyzed available data published between 1972 and 2017 on the interaction between mps and selected chemicals firstly the review analyzes the occurrence of chemicals in mps and outlines their distribution patterns then possible mechanisms of the interaction between mps and organic chemicals and potential controlling factors were critically studied finally the hazards of mps and affiliated organic chemicals to marine organisms were shortly summarized graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics toxic chemicals sorption mechanism distribution characteristics plastic pollution 1 introduction in recent years marine environment pollution has been attracting increased attention with the boom of marine activities particularly plastic pollution as lightweight strong versatile durable and affordable materials derraik 2002 laist 1987 plastics have been heavily used as basic constituents for a variety of commercial and consumer products andrady 2011 bockhorn et al 1999 roy et al 2011 teuten et al 2009 however the disposal of plastic products has caused heavy pollution to the marine environment laist 1987 pruter 1987 plastic is a main component of marine trash occupying about 60 80 in some areas up to 95 of ocean garbage derraik 2002 gregory and ryan 1997 moore 2008 the so called microplastics mps or plastic pellets have been detected in various oceanic compartments including surface seawater water column and sediment claessens et al 2011 derraik 2002 hammer et al 2012 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 obbard et al 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 as well as beaches estuaries remote islands and polar regions barnes et al 2009 gregory and ryan 1997 thompson et al 2004 while their definitions may vary andrady 2011 mps are generally categorized as plastic particles with effective diameters less than 5 mm which are usually cylinder or disk shaped barnes et al 2009 betts 2008 dubaish and liebezeit 2013 liebezeit and dubaish 2012 thompson et al 2009 turra et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 according to the different shapes of mps they can be mainly divided into fragments foams granules and fibers tsang et al 2017 because the degradation rate of mps is quite low andrady 2011 bakir et al 2014 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 mps can accumulate and concentrate in the oceans via various routes such as mechanical physical chemical and biological actions carpenter et al 1972 thompson et al 2004 2005 microplastics can be derived from primary and or secondary sources andrady 2011 primary sources mainly include additives used to increase friction in consumer products such as cosmetic and facial care products or hand cleaners and toothpaste andrady 2011 browne et al 2011 carr et al 2016 cole et al 2011 fendall and sewell 2009 gregory 1996 wang et al 2016 zitko and hanlon 1991 medical supplies such as grinding polishing agents used in dental teeth and capsules as vectors for inclusion of drugs patel et al 2009 overflowing drilling fluid in oil exploration industrial abrasives and air blast cleaning media gregory 1996 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 secondary sources are large plastics degraded to small particles through physical chemical and biological processes browne et al 2007 microplastics are ubiquitously distributed in the marine environment accounting for approximately 92 of global marine plastic debris eriksen et al 2014 because of their minute sizes mps are difficult to identify and can be easily ingested by aquatic organisms microplastics have larger specific surface area than large plastic particles so they may sorb much more organics lee et al 2014 the kinetic of chemical sorption on mp is important for their fate and transportation guo et al 2012 showed that the sorption of four hydrophobic organic compounds on three polymers reached equilibrium within 6 days in oceans the equilibrium will changed from time to time as gyres are still in a kinetic phase the chemicals in the mps also exchanged with the surrounding media as mps can be transferred with very long distance such as the arctic and the north pacific gyre under the action of wind and ocean currents rios mendoza and jones 2015 zarfl and matthies 2010 for most case it was proposed that the equilibration was reached in short time scales when analyzing chemical concentrations in mps moreover the sorption behavior of chemicals on mps is related to plastic types color and other physical and chemical properties e g size and chemical composition endo et al 2005 discolored mps have been reported to adsorb more pcbs than non discolored ones and polyethylene pe generally exhibits a greater sorption capacity to environmental pollutants than other plastic types alimi et al 2017 and the presence of other sorbents is also important according to koelmans et al 2016 and lohmann 2017 the total organic contaminant fraction absorbed by plastic is much smaller than that adsorbed by other media like dissolved organic carbon and colloids in the ocean seidensticker et al 2017 experimentally found that the concentration of dissolved organic matter could change the distribution of contaminants between the mp and water in addition the increase of mp concentration would increase adsorption of chemicals the sorption of chemicals on mps may transfer harmful substances such as persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt chemicals into the food chain bakir et al 2012 carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 mato et al 2001 rochman et al 2013b rockstrom et al 2009 rothstein 1973 zitko and hanlon 1991 which would seriously endanger marine life and ecological environment however some critical papers regarding the transfer potential of mp didn t draw the conclusion that mp is an important transport carrier or a vector to marine organism beckingham and ghosh 2017 gouin et al 2011 koelmans et al 2013 as the number of studies regarding mps and affiliated chemicals has considerably increased in recent years it is useful to examine the sorption mechanisms between mps and organic chemicals and identify research gaps and directions the objectives of this review are to 1 summarize the types of organic chemicals preferably affiliated to mps 2 analyze the occurrence of these chemicals in mps and outline their distribution patterns 3 examine possible mechanisms of the interaction between mps and the organic chemicals and potential controlling factors and 4 discuss the hazards of mps and affiliated organic chemicals to marine organisms 2 data assimilation and analysis peer reviewed journal articles related to mps in web of science published between 1972 and 2017 were assimilated and analyzed the reported concentrations of mps in the environment river seawater and sediment are extracted and summarized in table s1 total concentrations of 13pcb sum of pcb 66 101 110 149 118 105 153 138 128 187 180 170 and 206 ddt sum of ddt dde and ddd and hch sum of α hch β hch γ hch and δ hch on plastic pellets were calculated and divided into major cities small cities remote areas and remote islands fig 1 concentrations of main chemicals in cities of australia and new zealand were averaged using median concentrations from different sampling sites chemical concentrations in cities of portugal and remote islands were based on reporting median data from two selected articles fig 2 and fig s3 were drawn based on the reported concentrations of different chemicals on mps with different colors black aged white and colored fig 3 outlined median concentration of some selected congeners or isomers of target chemicals on mps based on data from three different countries china greece and portugal to study the temporal distribution of chemicals on mps data from two related papers were summarized in fig 4 to compare changes of chemical levels with time table s5 outlined partition coefficients of various chemicals in different types of plastic polymers from 12 selected studies the correlation between the octanol water partition coefficient log kow and the equilibrium partitioning coefficient between polymer and seawater or water log kpolymer sw log kpolymer w of the chemicals through the relevant regression analysis are also demonstrated in fig 5 kpolymer sw was calculated using partitioning ratios as follows 1 kpolymer sw kpolymersm kpdmssm kpdmssw where kpolymersm and kpdmssm are partition coefficients between polymer and solvent mixture and between pdms and solvent mixture respectively 3 microplastics and adhered chemicals 3 1 spatial variability fig 1 shows concentrations of 13pcb ddt and hch on plastic pellets from major cities small cities remote areas and remote islands it is clear that concentrations of pcbs ddts and hchs in mps collected from large cities such as sydney auckland and lisbon were almost an order of magnitude higher than those from small cities e g tauranga in new zealand or remote areas e g kimberley in australia and were almost two orders of magnitude greater than those on remote islands e g oahu kahuku beach oahu wawamalu beach in us heskett et al 2012 mizukawa et al 2013 yeo et al 2015 fig s2 shows the concentrations of pcbs ddts hchs and pahs in plastic pellets from four different places in greece karapanagioti et al 2011 the concentrations of all detected chemicals in pellets from loutropyrgo beach and aegena island were much higher than those from kato achaia beach and vatera island it is well known that the saronikos gulf is a polluted place as loutropyrgo and aegena are located at the saronikos gulf gómez gutiérrez et al 2007 galanopoulou et al 2005 kato achaia and vatera are located on the non polluted patras gulf karapanagioti et al 2011 likewise there are regional differences in the chemical concentrations detected on the mps pahs in mps found on the sandy beach were also analyzed and the results showed that pahs on the mps sediments in different depths had different concentrations and surface layer had the highest pah levels fisner et al 2013a 2013b apparently levels of chemicals adhered to plastic pellets are related to the regional levels of industrialization endo et al 2005 heskett et al 2012 hirai et al 2011 hosoda et al 2014 karapanagioti et al 2011 mato et al 2001 2002 mizukawa et al 2013 yeo et al 2015 the concentration of pollutants is also related to the abundance of mps 3 2 color difference plastic pellets are divided into four categories black aged white and colored fig 2 summarizes the levels of pcbs pahs and ddts on plastic pellets with different colors from ten beaches along the portuguese coast matosinhos espinho mira vieira de leiria paredes de vitoria peniche cresmina fonte da telha sines and bordei antunes et al 2013 fig s3 shows the total concentrations of pcbs pahs and ddts in each color fraction in alcobaça portugal frias et al 2013 aged and black pellets contained higher pcb and pah concentrations than colored and white ones fig 2 a 2 b and s3 on the other hand ddt concentrations were similar in black colored and white pellets but not aged ones fig 2 c and s3 overall aged and black pellets had higher concentrations of pcbs and pahs than white and colored pellets especially yellowing pellets antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2010 2013 rios et al 2007 aged pellets are yellowing ones that have been present for a long time in the oceans and with a high state of degradation sorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants to microplastic includes not only adsorption to surfaces but also absorption into particles their long residence time would increase the sorption concentration of chemicals on mps while degradation would increase their specific surface areas further increasing their sorption capacities antunes et al 2013 endo et al 2005 frias et al 2013 karapanagioti and klontza 2008 mato et al 2001 ogata et al 2009 and longer residence time allows diffusion of hydrophobic organic pollutants deeper into plastic particles from contaminated water these are the main reasons why aged pellets can sorb much more chemicals than other tinctorial pellets some researchers hold the opposite view that originally absorbed chemicals might be released to less polluted water during the migration and hence the concentration may decrease thus the effect of prolonged stay in the surrounding water environment on the sorption and desorption of pollutants by aged microplastic is dependent on the chemical levels of the water environment another reason is that black granules basically consist of polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp materials while aging particles are usually made up of pp and pe materials cavani and trifirò 1995 frias et al 2010 with regards to plastic materials pe usually has higher sorption affinities than other plastic polymers towards organic chemicals followed by pp and ps karapanagioti and klontza 2007 2008 karapanagioti et al 2010 teuten et al 2007 there are also some other potential reasons for example polyurethane pu was identified as a constituent of black pellets occasionally which may increase their ability to sorb chemicals antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2013 zia et al 2007 pigmented particles may also contain some colored additives such as pigments that make it easier to sorb chemicals from surrounding seawater frias et al 2013 the reason for pigments favour sorption is the organic contents taken from plants and animals can promote sorption capacity compared to black and aged particles white pellets sorb significantly less amounts of chemicals due to their translucent characteristic frias et al 2013 white pellets are often present in seawater for a short time resulting in low sorption and small specific surface areas endo et al 2005 frias et al 2010 ogata et al 2009 the above results explain why black and aged particles can sorb higher concentrations of chemicals than colored and white particles however endo et al 2005 suggested that the degree of aging in particles had no association with sorption of pcbs they argued that plastic aging occurs after stranding on the beach rather than in seawater while plastic sorption of chemicals occurs in seawater endo et al 2005 gregory 1983 3 3 congeners or isomers in addition to the total concentrations of the target chemicals in mps presented above these chemicals also include different congeners or isomers fig 3 depicts levels of pcb congeners pah isomers hch isomers and ddt metabolites in plastic pellets ng g 1 pellet from three different countries china greece and portugal karapanagioti et al 2011 mizukawa et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 generally concentrations of pcbs hchs and ddts on plastic pellets from china were lower than those from greece and portugal while pah concentrations in china were higher the results also showed that pcb 110 was the most abundant congener among all pcbs in china followed by pcb 138 and pcb 170 while pcb 138 pcb 153 pcb 170 pcb 180 and pcb 187 were predominant in greece and portugal fig 3 a as many countries began to reduce or stop pcb production after 1973 the occurrence of pcbs in these three countries may be a result of past pollution to be specific in the past these chemicals were released into water and accumulated in the water column and sediment and was later released to the environment however pcb concentrations on plastics were much higher in polluted areas and large cities which were probably related to industrial activities from their surroundings in addition heavily chlorinated congeners were enriched in mps especially hexa chlorinated pcbs pcb 138 and pcb 153 and hepta chlorinated pcbs pcb 187 180 and 170 this indicates that either heavily chlorinated congener has high ambient concentrations in the environment or plastic particles have strong tendency to sorb such homologues this question requires further study for pah isomers the concentrations of phenanthrene phe and chrysene chr were dominant in all three countries especially in china in rural cities from portugal fluoranthene fla phe and pyrene pyr were the most prevalent pah components while phe indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ipy and benzo ghi perylene bghip were dominant in large cities fig 3 b budzinski et al 1997 and boonyatumanond et al 2006 suggested that high ring 4 6 rings pahs were derived mainly from fossil fuels and incomplete combustion of organic matter in contrast low ring pahs 2 3 rings are derived mostly from petroleum products such as gasoline and lubricant oils apparently pahs on plastic pellets may have derived from both combustion of fossil fuels and petroleum residues due to the proximity to large oil and gas electric power plants rural cities of portugal mainly contained low ring pahs mizukawa et al 2013 and it can clearly see from fig 3 b that the concentration of high ring pahs on mps in qinhuangdao is much higher than that in dalian which is because there is a china s largest transportation port of coal near the sampling site the main source of pahs may have been the combustion of fossil fuels at other sampling sites the concentrations of hchs and ddts in mps were relatively higher at polluted sites or large cities except for hchs in portugal in greece γ hch was the most abundant hch isomer followed by δ hch while γ hch and δ hch were the main isomers in portugal fig 3 c hchs are commonly used legacy pesticides the γ isomer also known as lindane has the only insecticidal effect and the most rapid degradation rate followed by α and δ isomers with the β isomer extremely recalcitrant willett et al 1998 this is an important reason why γ hch is the main isomer found in mps hchs especially γ hch were mainly used for insect control on fruits and vegetables rice and seed treatment which is also the main reason why hchs mostly occurred in rural areas another possibility is that plastic particles have higher affinity with γ hch than β hch or δ hch ziccardi et al 2016 experimentally measured partition coefficients of γ hch are consistently greater than those of β and δ hch using pe pp and ps debris lee et al 2014 which also supports such argument the ddt products have played a significant role in preventing agricultural diseases and pests and reducing malaria typhoid fever and other mosquito borne diseases for the first half of the 20th century the major ddt compounds p p ddt p p ddd and p p dde have been detected in mps from both rural and urban areas while urban areas generally have higher ddt concentrations than rural areas mizukawa et al 2013 fig 3 d the use of ddts as pesticides in nearby catchments may be attributed to the higher concentrations of ddts in cities 3 4 temporal trends fig 4 shows temporal characteristics of various chemicals in plastic particles collected from south africa and vietnam from fig 4 it is clear that plastic particles associated chemical concentrations in these places have overall declined more specifically pcb and ddt concentrations in plastic pellets decreased markedly from 2007 to 2014 in the minh chau island vietnam and from 2008 to 2014 in the balat estuary while hch levels had a slight decrease le et al 2016 the same trend was also observed in plastic samples collected from south african beaches ryan et al 2012 however a slight increase of pcb and ddt concentrations occurred at west coast park in the western cape province of south africa from 1999 to 2008 and at woody cape in the eastern cape province from 1994 to 2005 concentrations of chemicals in the environment will theoretically be reduced over time if the source is controlled chemicals in the environment will gradually degrade with time although the degradation process can be very slow the decreasing trends in vietnam from 2007 to 2014 and on three south african beaches from 1984 to 2005 and from 1989 to 2008 are consistent with this assumption the main reason is the ban of pcb and ddt usage since 1970 which has been effective to reduce environmental sources of these chemicals ryan et al 2012 however the slight increase of pcb and ddt levels at west coast park from 1999 to 2008 and woody cape from 1994 to 2005 may be due to analytical uncertainties as well as the roles of contaminant reservoir such as contaminated sediments according to ryan et al 2012 the increase may be due to the underestimation of the pcb concentrations on plastic samples in 1999 and by re suspension of sediment during industrial activities 4 the interaction between microplastics and chemicals microplastics are known to sorb pbt compounds from surrounding water which may further act as carriers or vectors to transport these chemicals to biota bakir et al 2012 2014 bowmer and kershaw 2010 brennecke et al 2016 endo et al 2005 hirai et al 2011 holmes et al 2014 mato et al 2001 rios et al 2007 teuten et al 2007 2009 nevertheless beckingham and ghosh 2017 gouin et al 2011 and koelmans et al 2013 draw the inverse conclusion that mp is not an important transport vector of chemicals recent study of chen et al 2018 showed that plastic might have a role to play in the transfer of chemicals to certain marine organisms if the gradient of plastic to predators is present furthermore chemical concentration in mps might be even up to 105 to 106 times greater than that in ambient seawater mato et al 2001 rios et al 2010 takada 2006 wurl and obbard 2004 ziccardi et al 2016 however fugacity gradient is proportional to cpolymer kpolymer sw cw thus the debated results lead to comprehensive summary of current study on the interaction between chemicals and mps 4 1 the effects of hydrophobicity kow table s5 shows partition coefficients of different chemicals derived from linear kd and freundlich kf models octanol water partition coefficients kow and polymer water partitioning coefficients in seawater kpolymer sw and water kpolymer w the equation for the linear model is as follows 2 kd qe solid ce aq where qe is the amount of contaminant sorbed onto plastic ug kg 1 at equilibrium and ce is the contaminant concentration in the aqueous phase at equilibrium ug l 1 the equation for the freundlich model is as follows 3 log qe log kf 1 nf log ce where qe ug kg 1 is the concentration of the contaminant on the solid phase at equilibrium ce ug l 1 contaminant concentration in the aqueous phase at equilibrium kf l kg 1 is the multilayer adsorption capacity and 1 nf is the freundlich exponent and an indicator of the site energy distribution of a sorbent ie sorbent heterogeneity increases as n decreases the equation for polymer water partitioning coefficients in seawater or water is as follows 4 kpolymer sw kpol ymersm kpdmssm kpdmssw where kpolymersm and kpdmssm are partition coefficients between polymer and solvent mixture and between pdms and solvent mixture respectively kpdmssw is partition coefficient between pdms and seawater from fig 5 a the hydrophobicity kow is generally in the order of hchs pcbs ddts pahs it is clear that the log kow log kd or log kf of ddt log kow 6 79 log kd 4 99 4 31 log kf 5 9 on pe is generally higher than that of phe log kow 4 6 log kd 4 71 4 08 kf 4 6 0 12 similarly the value of log kow log kd or log kf of ddt 6 79 5 02 4 18 5 4 on poly vinyl chloride pvc is also greater than that of phe 4 6 3 36 2 81 3 3 table s5 fig 5 b shows that the partition coefficients kpolymer sw and kpolymer w of chemicals on different types of mps have a strong relationship with the kow of chemicals which is in accordance with ziccardi et al 2016 for the fitting curves in fig 5 b the values of adj r square of logkpe w logkpe sw logkpp sw and logkps sw with log kow are 0 97 0 92 0 93 and 0 83 respectively the fitting results of logkpe w and kow are the best followed by logkpp sw and logkpe sw and the worst is logkps sw generally the fitting result can successfully indicate the relationship between log k and log kow however the log kf of dehp is lower than that of ddt while the log kow and log kd of the former chemical is higher this may indicate that the sorption of dehp is more consistent with the freundlich isotherm model in fig 5 a the log kd or log kf values of dehp and ddt were all higher than those of phe and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa which suggests the same plastic materials sorb more dehp and ddt than phe and pfoa it needs to point out that pfoa usually carries ionic charges in aquatic environment which is also the reason of lower sorption the log kd or log kf values of phe ddt pfoa and dehp on pe are apparently higher than on those on pvc this suggests that pe has a higher affinity with most chemicals than pvc for example teuten et al 2007 showed that pe particles can sorb and accumulate more organic chemicals than other plastics like pp and pvc pellets from fig 5 a the values of log kpe w for pah isomers follow the order bghip benzo a pyrene bap benz k fluoranthene bkf chr benz a anthracene baa pyrene pyr fla anthracene ant fluorene flu acenaphthene acp naphthalene nap such a finding illustrates that pe sorbs more high ring 4 6 rings pahs than low ring pahs 2 3 rings in aquatic environment as larger high ring pahs are more hydrophobic similarly pp and ps show higher affinities towards high ring pahs than with low ring pahs the log kd or log kf for pcbs pahs hchs and ddts on pe in water are in the range of 4 19 6 88 2 81 7 27 2 2 2 8 and 4 22 5 77 and the log kow for pcbs pahs hchs and ddts are as followed 5 11 7 88 3 00 6 35 3 55 4 14 and 6 79 ddt table s5 these findings indicate that pahs pcbs and ddts can partition to mps more readily than hchs frias et al 2013 hirai et al 2011 karapanagioti et al 2011 as for log kpe sw log kpp sw or log kps sw the value for α hch is greater than that of other hch isomers followed by γ hch δ hch and β hch fig 5 a this suggests plastic has a higher affinity with α hch and γ hch than δ hch and β hch in seawater when comparing log kpe sw log kpp sw and log kps sw of hch isomers it is clear that hch could partition more on ps than on pp and pe for pah isomers the values of log kpe sw and log kps sw are similar while the log kpp sw is relatively low generally log kd or log kf values in seawater are higher than in water such as the log kpe sw of pahs is greater than their log kpe w however the log kpe sw 5 22 of hexachlorobenzene is slightly lower than log kpe w 5 43 table s5 it suggests that salinity is an important factor influencing the partition behavior bakir et al 2014 as discussed further below 4 2 the materials of microplastics it is well known that mps have different types colors sizes and compositions the most common types of mps in the marine environment are pe and pp ps and pvc endo et al 2005 it was reported that organic chemicals were easily sorbed on mps due to their hydrophobic nature takada 2006 many other studies observed that chemicals usually had higher diffusion coefficients on low density mps than high density mps fries and zarfl 2012 karapanagioti and klontza 2008 lee et al 2018 mato et al 2001 2002 teuten et al 2007 it should be attributed to the slower diffusion rate of chemicals on high density mps for example the sorption of perfluorooctane sulphonate pfos and perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa on pe and pvc was reported to be greater than on ps wang et al 2015 while the partition coefficient of phe on pe was an order of magnitude higher than that of pp followed by pvc teuten et al 2007 polyethylene has generally been reported to exhibit greater adsorption capacity than other types of plastics alimi et al 2017 the distribution order of chemical substances on various types of plastic were ldpe hdpe pp pvc ps o connor et al 2016 where pvc and ps are glassy polymers with the glass transition temperature tg at 80 c is higher than normal ambient temperature resulting in low mobility of the polymer and low diffusivity of the penetrant these findings showed the sorption of chemicals was related to the type of plastics lee et al 2014 rochman et al 2013a previous studies showed concentrations of chemicals such as pcbs and pahs on black and aged plastic pellets were much higher than those on white and colored ones antunes et al 2013 frias et al 2010 2013 rios et al 2007 black plastic pellets may have more additives like pu than white pellets which may enhance the sorption level frias et al 2013 the size of plastic particles is also an important factor table s6 shows some physical characteristics and partition coefficients for sorption of phe on various polymers teuten et al 2007 it is clear that pe pp and pvc of the same size ranging from 200 μm to 250 μm had different bet surface areas and distribution coefficients table s6 showed that the log kd of pe log kd 4 58 3 75 was greater than pp log kd 3 34 2 23 and pvc log kd 3 22 2 30 which was attributed to the larger surface area of pe than pp and pvc plastic particles with smaller sizes had a higher surface area for sorption than larger particles and larger one also had longer distance for chemical diffusion than smaller one when the equilibrium is reached lee et al 2014 seidensticker et al 2017 for example the distribution coefficients of nano plastics log kd 5 82 5 23 were much higher than that of mps log kd 4 23 3 04 ma et al 2016 such findings indicated that the particle size of plastics was not only crucial for organic chemical sorption but also for equilibration times velzeboer et al 2014 the four common types of plastics pe pp pvc and ps at a given environmental temperature can be divided into two categories rubbery plastics pe and pp and glassy plastics pvc and ps which are also connected to the tg alimi et al 2017 kurtz 2004 teuten et al 2009 teuten et al 2009 reported that a certain polymer can transit from a rubbery state to a glassy state when it cools below its tg some studies showed that rubbery plastics such as pe and pp had a higher affinity with chemicals than glassy plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate pet and pvc guo et al 2012 rochman et al 2013a wu et al 2001 george and thomas 2001 proposed that glassy polymers have a more dense structure with little void space and present higher cohesive forces while rubbery polymers exhibit a large amount of free volume between molecules and present greater mobility and flexibility glassy polymers have long lived and closed internal nano scale pores due to their rigidity that act as adsorption sites such structures lead to a higher sorption level of chemicals and slower diffusion rate in glassy polymers than rubbery plastics teuten et al 2009 the phenomenon is reflected in the intrapolymer diffusion coefficients as well specifically the diffusion coefficients of organic compounds in ps pvc are lower than in pe chen et al 2018 seidensticker et al 2017 in general rubbery plastics small particulate plastic particles and black plastic pellets likely sorb more chemicals 4 3 the degree of weathering aging effect as mentioned in the previous section the aging of plastics increased its ability to sorb chemicals endo et al 2005 ogata et al 2009 rios et al 2007 aged plastic has a greater state of degradation mainly due to long term photooxidation seawater corrosion friction or other processes brennecke et al 2016 eriksson and burton 2003 photooxidation and friction made large plastic pieces exposed to uv light decompose into mps thereby increasing specific surface areas and surface roughness of mps which further increase their sorption capacities furthermore pérez et al 2010 indicated that the aging process led to a decrease in the molecular weight of the polymer which indirectly affects its sorbent properties another phenomenon was to use beach plastic particles as passive samplers to monitor the concentrations of chemicals in marine environment ogata et al 2009 takada 2006 rummel et al 2017 showed that biofilm plastic interactions have the ability to affect the fate and impact of mps by increasing the specific surface area and equilibration times in summary the effect of weathering aging on plastics would enhance the sorption capacity of chemicals due to a higher specific surface area the surface coverage of organic matter and so on 4 4 the influence of salinity as shown in table s5 the log kpe sw and log kpe w of the same chemical are slightly different for most pahs the log kpe sw is slightly greater than log kpe w while log kpe sw of hexachlorobenzene and α hch is lower than log kpe w while it would be expected that the salting out effect would provide a greater fugacity to drive dissolved neutral organic compounds to sorb to mps this does not explain the latter observed decreases studies exist the effect of salinity on sorption and desorption between plastics and chemicals adams et al 2007 bakir et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 wang et al 2015 but further investigations are needed to elucidate such an effect table s7 shows the corresponding log kf for the sorption of phe and ddt onto pvc and pe over a series of salinity gradients and desorption rate k day 1 sd in pure milliq water 0 psμ and in seawater 35 psμ adopted from bakir et al 2014 salinity for test included 0 8 8 17 5 26 3 and 35 psμ practical salinity scale unit corresponding to 0 25 50 75 100 of seawater respectively there was no significant change in the partition coefficient log kf of pvc phe pe phe pvc ddt and pe ddt with the increase in salinity it can be seen that the desorption rate between plastic and chemical in milliq water was a bit inferior to that in seawater the desorption rate between plastic and ddt is distinctly less than that of plastic phe according to wang et al 2015 salinity increase would increase the sorption capacity of pfos on pe but had no evident impact on fosa sorption the same study also found that pfos in pure water cannot be sorbed on ps pellets but sorbed on ps particles at high salt concentrations these observations all indicate that the sorption of pfos on mps was much easier in seawater than in water for the effects of salt on partition coefficients lohmann et al 2012 used the setschenow equation to calculate the effect of dissolved salts on the ksw of nonpolar compounds the equation was as follows 5 logksw logksw 0 ksi where ksw is the sampler water partition coefficient i is the ionic strength in moles per liter ks is the setschenow constant in liters per mole and ksw 0 is the sampler water partition coefficient at an ionic strength of 0 4 5 the impacts of ph and temperature at present there are a few reports about the impact of solution chemistry on the chemical sorption on mps the ph of solution should theoretically affect ionic chemicals sorption on mp due to the electrostatic interaction the study of wang et al 2015 showed that the sorption of pfos on pe and ps particles increases with a decrease in ph while neither had an effect on the sorption of neutral fosa on these plastics such findings may suggest that properties of mps and chemicals strongly influence the sorption process table s8 shows log kpe w values of some chemicals at different temperatures the log kpe w of phe increases with increasing temperature from 18 to 24 c 4 2 at 18 c 4 23 0 02 at 23 c and 4 3 0 1 at 24 c but was slightly lower at 30 c 4 16 0 02 than at 24 c pyr presents a similar trend as phe with a log kpe w value of 4 62 at 16 4 18 7 c which is smaller than those at 23 c 5 02 0 03 and 24 c 5 0 0 1 however it slightly decreased when temperature reached 30 c 4 90 0 01 for most hocs e g phe fla pyr chr and benzo e pyrene bep log kpe w values at 30 c were less than those at 24 c pcb 52 is an exception with log kpe w at 30 c being slightly higher than that at 23 c the study of lohmann et al 2012 showed that partition coefficient ksw for chlorobenzenes pcbs pahs and dde on plastics appears to be essentially temperature independent possibly with the exception of phe 5 microplastics and marine organisms at present mps had been found in a large number of marine organisms gall and thompson 2015 as they mistake and swallow tiny mps as food and transfer them to their food chains cole et al 2013 lusher et al 2013 it was estimated that 693 species in 2015 had been affected by marine plastic pollution while 267 species were recorded to have marine plastic debris in their bodies gall and thompson 2015 for example plastic fragments or mps were identified in the guts stomachs and tissues of marine organisms such as seabirds blight and burger 1997 fishes collard et al 2015 miranda and de carvalho souza 2016 turtles bjorndal et al 1994 whales fossi et al 2012 tarpley and marwitz 1993 crabs watts et al 2016 and even the alimentary tract of gudgeons gobio gobio sanchez et al 2014 table s9 shows the spatial distribution of mps in several aquatic organisms from different areas the amount of mps in bivalves was reported to range from 4 3 to 57 2 items individual of a chinese fishery market li et al 2015 in addition the number of plastic fibers found was up to 178 items individual in mytilus edulis from canada mathalon and hill 2014 while the levels of mps 0 03 0 18 items individual in demersal fish from the north sea and baltic sea were approximately four orders of magnitude lower than that in mytilus edulis rummel et al 2016 thus the plastic debris in the ocean is not only a kind of global environmental pollution problem but also brings potential harms to marine organisms plastic debris is related to the injury of organism derraik 2002 gregory 2009 and may even lead to sub vital and mortality effects on individuals browne et al 2015 cole and galloway 2015 the harm of plastic fragments to marine life is mainly manifested in physical chemical and biological effects with regards to physical aspects plastic debris has a direct mechanical effect on marine creatures through entanglement and ingestion for example large plastic debris or fragments block the passage of food and affect appetite and can even cause intestinal perforation and reproductive impairment derraik 2002 gregory 2009 moore 2008 wilcox et al 2015 to be specific plastic debris particularly synthetic fibers swallowed by animals may cause a false feeling of satiation or lead to internal blockage or damage to the digestive system all these effects would then reduce food intake and affect digestion and finally cause starvation and death duis and coors 2016 foekema et al 2013 hjelmeland et al 1988 jackson et al 2000 ryana 1988 wright et al 2013 according to von moos et al 2012 ingested plastic particles may stay in the alimentary canal and cause internal wear and inflammation predation further transfers mps into the food chains for example pelagic zooplankton are more susceptible to microplastic uptake which indirectly causes serious harm to the food chain due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of microplastics and chemicals cole and galloway 2015 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 moore 2008 another example is the blue mussel mytilus edulis they can ingest and transport microplastic particles to the gut which then accumulate in the digestive cavity and tubules browne et al 2008 overall the physical harm of mps are to cause injury after ingesting plastic fragments affect the digestive system and even cause starvation donohue et al 2001 but one important factor is that the mp concentrations in these lab experiments were orders of magnitude higher than those which can be found in the environment such physical injuries of mp should only occur with mp heavily polluted areas with regards to chemical aspects mps indirectly affect the organism because they can sorb and concentrate harmful chemicals from the surroundings and transport these chemicals into organisms mato et al 2001 teuten et al 2007 2009 as mentioned earlier mps or plastic fragments could be an importance transport route or vector for chemicals into the marine food web bakir et al 2012 chemicals sorbed on the surface of mps and plasticizers or additives released from plastics can enter the organism with the particles and could be released through desorption processes to cause effects such as lesions to the organism and ultimately to humans bakir et al 2014 cole et al 2011 farrell and nelson 2013 neves et al 2015 watts et al 2014 according to ryana 1988 the amount of ingested plastic particles had a positive correlation with the concentrations of pcbs in the adipose tissues of great shearwaters puffinus gravis in addition mps have a larger surface area than plastic debris which make them more accessible to sorb organic chemicals and plasticizers from surrounding seawater lee et al 2014 microplastics are also small enough to enter the living body while large plastic fragments can be blocked without a hitch thus mps may potentially cause greater damage than large plastic fragments to creatures in marine environment mohamed nor and obbard 2014 chemicals absorbed to mps such as pcbs and those released from mps such as bpa have carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic effects on organisms zhang et al 2016 however some researchers are still controversial about the vector function of mps according to gouin et al 2011 and beckingham and ghosh 2017 the transfer of organic contaminants into biological organisms by dietary mps may be a small or limited contribution compared to other natural routes of exposure in most cases therefore mps can introduce these harmful chemicals into organisms only when fugacity of a chemical in microplastics is greater than that in organism which may result in an exposure risk with regards to biological aspects mps may become gathering places for some microorganisms this will introduce new or non native species into other areas through transport of plastic debris by ocean currents and wind patterns such as bryozoans barnes 2002 derraik 2002 last but not least mps indirectly have a harmful effect on human health bivalves such as mussels m edulis and oysters crassostrea gigas are popular seafood in which mps have been discovered in both farmed and wild bivalves mathalon and hill 2014 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 therefore humans at the top of the food chain may be subject to potential health risks after the consumption of seafood polluted by mps and toxic chemicals seltenrich 2015 in summary the mps in the ocean not only cause marine environmental pollution issues affecting marine biodiversity but also have a potential of causing harmful effects on marine organisms and humans gall and thompson 2015 6 conclusions this review analyzes the distribution characteristics of chemicals on mps and discusses the sorption behavior between mps and chemicals chemicals adhered to mps sampled from larger cities or highly industrialized areas are higher than that in smaller cities or remote areas in addition chemicals sorbed on black or aged mps are at a greater concentration than that on colored or white mps furthermore chemical levels on mps will also be reduced due to the prohibition on use of some organic chemicals and to the degradation of chemicals these results are related to the sorption mechanisms between mps and chemicals which are mainly controlled by the physical chemical properties of mps nature of chemicals temperature and solution chemistry finally mps may enter the body of organisms through ingestion enter the food chain via predation and eventually reach the human bodies they can cause hazardous effects on ecological and human health this review article calls for public attention on microplastic pollution from a scientific viewpoint acknowledgements this

19554,laboratory degradation tests with two model estrogen conjugates 17ß estradiol 3 glucuronide e2 3g and 17ß estradiol 3 sulphate e2 3s using river water and sediment as inoculum under aerobic conditions were investigated throughout the 14 day incubation degradation of e2 3g in river water at environmentally relevant level 25 ng l obeyed first order kinetics with the formation of 17 ß estradiol and estrone in contrast e2 3s was slowly converted to estrone 3 sulphate stoichiometrically degradation of the two conjugates across the spiking concentrations 0 01 1 μg g was much faster in sediment than in river water where 25 ng l of conjugate standards were spiked possibly due to relatively high population densities of microorganisms in sediment de conjugation of the thio ester bond at c 3 position and oxidation at c 17 position were the predominant degradation mechanisms for e2 3g and e2 3s respectively with negligible presence of metabolites estrone 3 glucuronide for e2 3g and 17ß estradiol for e2 3s in addition delta 9 11 dehydroestrone and 6 ketoestrone were determined as new metabolites of the two conjugates also a lactone compound hydroxylated estrone and a few sulfate conjugates were tentatively identified with the observation of new metabolites biodegradation pathways of e2 3g and e2 3s were proposed the formation of new metabolites may pose unknown risks to

disrupting compounds which could exert adverse effects on aquatic wildlife at environmentally relevant ng l level including intersexuality feminization and reproductive and behavioral problems jobling et al 1998 2006 kidd et al 2007 pelissero et al 1993 estrogens exhibit up to thousands times higher estrogenic potency than other major pharmaceuticals and personal care products as reflected by their predicted no effect concentration values li et al 2013 or the yeast estrogen screen results beek et al 2006 yost et al 2013 estrogens were frequently detected at low concentrations in the range of ng l to μg l in surface waters kolpin et al 2002 belfroid et al 1999 khanal et al 2006 ma et al 2016 gorga et al 2015 consequently investigation of estrogen contamination has drawn worldwide attention in the past few decades the routine administration of sex hormones to human and livestock as medicine leads to large estrogen loadings to environment it has been revealed that estrogen hormones were excreted in significant amounts from vertebrates in biologically inactive conjugates d ascenzo et al 2003 hanselman et al 2003 estrogen sulfate or glucuronide conjugation at c 3 and c 17 position of the basic parent estrogen structure commonly exist in the environment the sulfate or glucuronide moieties make the estrogen conjugates more water soluble and mobile posing an environmental risk once they are hydrolyzed to biologically active free estrogens khanal et al 2006 pinto et al 2014 nazari and suja 2016 estrogen conjugates enter the aqueous environment through sewage discharge and animal waste disposal a substantial portion can be converted back to their parent forms somewhere before and or after entering sewage treatment plants stps kumar et al 2012 liu et al 2015 arylsulfatase and ß glucuronidase enzymes synthesized by escherichia coli were suggested to be responsible for the de conjugation of estrogen sulfate and glucuronide respectively ternes et al 1999 duong et al 2011 estrogen conjugates normally occurred in wastewater treatment effluents at up to several ng l with estrogen sulfate outweighing glucuronide ma et al 2016 ben et al 2017 naldi et al 2016 animal waste disposal could cause considerable conjugate loadings to surface water considering one third of total estrogens in waste holding ponds of concentrated animal feeding operations were detected as conjugates hutchins et al 2007 for example up to 26 8 ng l of 17ß estradiol 3 sulphate e2 3s was observed in an agricultural watershed receiving poultry litter dutta et al 2012 estrogen conjugates that survive decomposition or bypass stp treatment enter river water and could liberate free estrogens and various intermediates with blurry biological activity leading to potential risks following water reuse however the majority of studies on estrogen conjugates to date have focused on their fate and degradation behavior based on laboratory batch studies using soil or activated sludge as incubation media chen and hu 2009 scherr et al 2008 2009 shrestha et al 2012 bai et al 2013 or in aqueous media on their occurrence and removal efficiency ma et al 2016 d ascenzo et al 2003 reddy et al 2005 griffith et al 2014 kumar et al 2011 in contrast relatively little is known about their degradation behavior and transformative pathways in river water environment the main goal of the study was to investigate the degradation of two model conjugates 17ß estradiol 3 glucuronide e2 3g and e2 3s and their transformation products in river water and sediment the degradation behavior of the two conjugates was investigated in river water at environmentally relevant ng l level and in sediment at three amendment levels finally degradation mechanisms were proposed electrospray collision induced dissociation cid tandem mass spectrometry together with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms were used for structure elucidation of metabolites at a specific degradation time knowledge on degradation kinetics and the formation of microbial metabolites is important for assessing the environmental behavior of estrogen conjugates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical standards

samples ranged 0 01 0 37 ng l and 71 6 98 5 respectively table s1 biodegradation of estrogen conjugates in sediment was evaluated at three concentration levels under aerobic condition specifically 5 g of fresh sediment and 2 ml of river water from the same site sampled in april 2017 were added to a 20 ml epa vial to make slurry where 50 μl of 1 10 and 100 μg ml of meoh free e2 3g or e2 3s was added separately to give a nominal concentration of 0 01 0 1 and 1 μg g wet weight basis for each compound in fresh sediment after the fortification the lid was tightened and the vial was vortex mixed and put in a 20 1 c incubator for 14 days the large headspace above the slurry ensured aerobic condition autoclaved sediments 120 c for 51 min at the highest fortification level served as sterile control

converted to their trimethylsilyl tms m z 73 0 derivatives which were identified based on national institute of standards and technology nist 14 mass spectrum library searching program and mass spectrum interpretation 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerobic degradation in river water the time course for e2 3g and e2 3s degradation in river water is illustrated in fig 1 comparison of their degradation trend against sterile controls suggests that biodegradation is mainly responsible for the loss of estrogen conjugates degradation of e2 3g obeys simple first order exponential kinetic model the calculated degradation rate constant k and half life t1 2 were 0 0355 h 1 and 18 h respectively kumar et al 2012 also recorded a similar half life of 15 4 h for e2 3g 370 ng l in incubated river water about half of fortified e2 3g was removed within the first day and was non detectable after 9 days of incubation suggesting that even at the environmentally relevant ng l level e2 3g can still be transformed the loss of e2 3g was accompanied by the concomitant formation of the primary degradation product e2 which was further oxidized to e1 the maximum percentage of e2 3g converted to e2 was 34 equal to 56 in molar percent estrone approached a plateau accounting for 20 over the period of 4 9 d the absence of e1 3g suggests that the dominant degradation pathway for e2 3g under the present conditions was hydrolysis of the thio ester bond at the c 3 position rather than oxidation at c 17 position degradation of e2 3s was much slower than e2 3g and the removal of e2 3s was concurrent with the sole detection of e1 3s fig 1b with 19 of e2 3s remaining after 14 days the molar percentages similar to weight percentages of e2 3s and e1 3s summed to around unity and remained unchanged for 9 days implying a stoichiometric conversion of e2 3s to e1 3s initially the two represented 83 of the original conjugates after 14 days to our knowledge this is likely the first study of degradation of e2 3s in river water at such low levels therefore hardly any other finding with this regard can be used for comparison however the stoichiometric oxidation at the c 17 site for e2 3s was also observed for e2 as investigated by yu et al 2007 who ascribed the pattern to the inability of the e2 degraders to catalyze the metabolite e1 while based on the previous results in a e2 3s degradation study that as arylsulphatase i e arylsulfatase was inhibited the formation and persistence of the major metabolite e1 3s were more pronounced scherr et al 2009 the slow degradation and accumulation of e1 3s in our study were expected since arylsulfatase in river water would be at insufficient levels in contrast to e2 3g e2 3s underwent a 2 day lag phase indicative that acclimation was necessary for the micro organisms to adapt before degradation began similar result was reported by d ascenzo et al 2003 who investigated the degradation behavior of e2 3s at an initial concentration of 25 μg l in domestic wastewater and also observed a 10 h of lag phase prior to progressive biodegradation after the lag phase degradation of e2 3s generally followed a linear trend other sulfate conjugate such as 17α estradiol 3 sulfate zheng et al 2013 in diluted dairy wastewater also displayed similar degradation profile aerobically these results are in line with the incomplete transformation of sulfate conjugate in stps kumar et al 2012 and its frequent detection in aqueous environments ma et al 2016 isobe et al 2003 3 2 aerobic degradation in sediment as illustrated in fig 2 the rapid depletion in the nonsterile treatments and the lack of abiotic loss in the sterile controls suggest that sorption to sediment is minimum while microorganisms play a key role in the dissipation of e2 3g and e2 3s in sediment the data all fit well to a simple first order kinetic model for three amendment levels and corresponding model parameters are presented in table 1 the half lives table 1 ranged respectively 0 81 3 94 h for e2 3g and 3 11 22 36 h for e2 3s table 1 which are within the range reported in raw sewage kumar et al 2012 and in soils scherr et al 2009 shrestha et al 2012 one conspicuous finding is as the initial concentration of e2 3g or e2 3s increased k value decreased table 1 such degradation trend was also reported before for e2 3g and e2 3s in agricultural soils soil slurries or moist soil shrestha et al 2012 ma and yates 2017 and activated sludge ng ml to μg ml range ternes et al 1999 elsewhere the inversed trend was proposed by marcus and talalay 1955 to be explained by the formation of nonactivated biomolecular complexes enzyme substrate complex involving two substrate molecules when degradation of testosterone and related androgens by a purified bacteria enzyme was investigated conversely chen and hu 2009 observed an increasing k value with increasing initial concentrations of e2 3g and e2 3s 10 400 μg l in sludge slurries apart from the stimulatory effect of high initial substrate concentration on the microorganisms the researchers provided a possible reason that the degradation intermediates of the conjugates did not compete with amended compound itself for binding with degraders because the activated sludge with relatively high concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids in the study would carry large bacterial population and result in effective degradation of the conjugates and their metabolites even at high initial concentration the explanation can be supported by the findings in another study that the first order rate constant k of e2 3s was significantly correlated to soil organic carbon content r 0 978 p 0 1 and to soil microbial biomass carbon r 0 995 p 0 05 scherr et al 2009 in our case the conjugates and their metabolites serving as carbon source could be saturated for microbiota in the sandy sediment major degradation products of the two conjugates were displayed in subfigures of fig 2 as initial concentration increased there was an overall increase some broadening and late arrival of the metabolite peaks a further hint that the metabolites together with their amended compounds as substrate could be saturated for the microbiota additionally degradation rate of the conjugates and their major metabolites at the medium initial level 0 1 μg g was close to that at the lowest level 0 01 μg g while the difference gap widened as concentration scale become larger 1 μg g the finding is comparable to the previous observation that between 0 03 and 10 μg l estrogen was degraded at similar rates in sewage while the rate was obviously slowed when estrogen concentration reached 100 μg l xu et al 2009 this was ascribed by the investigator to the possible availability of a key cometabolite at 100 μg l concentration limiting estrogen removal the figure also indicates that the metabolites at the highest initial concentration in particular persisted longer with certain amount detected at the end of the incubation the conversion of e2 3g to e2 was not complete as e2 accounted for 6 17 approximate 8 22 molar percent of original fortified conjugate at the highest point earlier 6 formation of e2 from e2 3g was reported in incubated surface soils shrestha et al 2012 ma and yates 2017 similar to the case in river water no discernable proportion of e1 3g was detected fig s3 nevertheless the absence of e1 3g seems counter to intuition given a wide range of bacteria was responsible for oxidation of e2 to e1 at c 17 position yu et al 2007 colucci et al 2001 jiang et al 2010 tanaka et al 2009 moreover prior batch studies of e2 3g degradation in soils observed considerable quantities of e1 3g shrestha et al 2012 this observation suggests that transformation mechanisms of estrogen conjugates in river water could be different from other compartments possibly due to differences of microbial population densities types and activeness as well as the dissolved oxygen content in the incubation media the proportions of e1 3s converted from e2 3s accounted for 33 100 of the applied e2 3s similar to the range of 55 100 reported by scherr et al 2009 in a soil microcosm study since the formation of e2 was trivial 0 3 fig s4 the secondary metabolite e1 8 was thus converted from e1 3s the low proportions of e1 and e2 in the present study as metabolites of e2 3s are congruent with a prior batch study with raw sewage and river water kumar et al 2012 indicative oxidation as the predominant transformation pathway of e2 3s in river sediment another noticeable finding is the maximum proportion of e1 decreased as the initial concentration of fortified e2 3s rose suggested that other transformation pathways become more important than de conjugation when e1 3s as substrate is saturated the formation of new metabolites of e1 3s with high level 10 μg g of e2 3s amended discussed in the next section provides certain evidence for this if this were the case degradation of e1 3s may not simply form e1 in particular when the initial concentration is high while other metabolites might need to be calculated for modelling and risk assessment 3 3 new metabolite formation in addition to the abovementioned general metabolites microbial assisted degradation of e2 3g in the sediment leads to four new products as indicated on the gc ms chromatograms fig 3 a these degradation metabolites are labeled herein asⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ the mass spectra of the new products were subject to nist library searching by comparison tms derivatives of products ⅱand ⅲ exhibited highly similar fragment patterns to that of 9 11 dehydro e1 and 6 keto e1 respectively fig s5 and the tms derivatives of the authentic standards also showed identical retention times and spectra figure not shown productsⅱand ⅲ were thus determined to be 9 11 dehydro e1 and 6 keto e1 respectively with respect to the tms derivatives of productⅰ molecular ion at m z 430 and ⅳ molecular ion at m z 358 no corresponding tms derivatives with similar mass spectra in the library were found however their spectra suggested that they could have two and one oh moieties respectively to react with bstfa herein a molecular ion at m z 286 430 2h 2tms forⅰand 358 h tms for ⅳ was tentatively assigned to productⅰand ⅳ to assist identification the underivatized counterpart of the sediment extract was reanalyzed and one new peak in the extract with a retention time of 15 33 min and a molecular ion at m z 286 showed its mass spectra identical to that of estrolactone with one oh group attached fig s6 product ⅳ was therefore tentatively identified to be estrolactone the structure of productⅰwas unclear nevertheless the molecular ion m z 430 represents 14 with respect to that of derivatized e2 m z 272 2h 2tms possibly corresponding to keto e2 or oh substituted e1 based on the peak areas yields of product ⅱand ⅲ peaked around 72 144 h of incubation according to our knowledge estrolactone as a biodegradation product of either e2 3g or e2 has never been reported before a similar metabolite with a lactone structure at the d ring was proposed as a biodegradation product of e2 lee and liu 2002 keto e1 has been tentatively identified as degradation intermediate of e2 by soil isolates of rhodococcus sp and sphingomonas sp kurisu et al 2010 9 11 dehydro e1 was not reported as estrogen metabolites by others although data was simultaneously collected on hplc using mass and uv detector the uv spectra fig 3b for e2 3g were included here since the spectra were able to show the new metabolites product a to f clearly these degradation metabolites are labelled herein as a f to differentiate them from gc ms peaks the ambiguous identification of different metabolites was achieved via the application of cid fragmentation mechanisms a precursor ion of each new metabolite selected based on the full scan spectra was subject to cid in a product ion scan mode and the subclass precursor normally a product ion with the greatest signal intensity was selected for further fragmentation corresponding spectra of all new products listed in alphabetical order were shown in fig s7 products b and f with pseudomolecular ions m h at m z 283 and 267 were identified to be 6 keto e1 and 9 11 dehydro e1 in accordance to product ⅲ and ⅱby gc ms respectively considering the identical cid spectra fig s8 and retention times with that of the standards without an authentic reference compound structure of other products can only be tentatively deducted from their molecular ions and fragmentation patterns product a and c with a pseudomolecular ion m h at m z 285 upon cid exhibited a characteristic ion at m z 267 which can be explained by a neutral loss of h2o to form a double bond implying there is an second oh group in the structure in addition to the existing one at c 3 position considering water loss from the aromatic ring is not favored and the subsequent fragmentation pattern of the ion at m z 267 is similar to that of 8 9 dehydro e1 fig s9 and 9 11 dehydro e1 fig s8 authentic standards the second oh is likely located at b or c ring formation of major fragments m z 251 237 223 209 195 and 171 of the ion at m z 267 was proposed as shown in fig s7 we determined product a and c to be hydroxy e1 although the position of the oh group is not located b ring or c ring oh substituted e1 hasn t been reported to be potential microbial degradation product of e2 or e1 in soil environment however hydroxylation of e2 and or e1 at various positions was reviewed by zhu and conney 1998 to be catalyzed by enzymes present in animal or human tissues as exemplified by human cytochrome p450 enzymes in the current study hydroxylation could be performed by soil bacteria as soil bacterial isolates were reported to oxidize e2 or e1 via hydroxylation at a or d ring which is then followed by ring cleavage kurisu et al 2010 casas campillo and bautista 1965 products d and e were not identified in the present study due to limited data available like e2 3g e2 3s showed the presence of 6 keto e1 9 11 dehydro e1 and estrolactone as potential degradation products on gc ms chromatograms fig s10 nevertheless the hplc ms ms spectra suggested of additional distinctive products fig 4 products g m have pseudomolecular ions m h at m z 365 or 363 which were selected as initial precursor ions for fragmentation fig s11 the formation of characteristic ions at m z 267 m hso3 h2o 285 m hso3 or 283 m hso3 and 80 so3 suggested products g m should be all sulfate conjugated metabolites to elucidate the structure of the products those characteristic ions m z 267 285 and 283 were fragmented further and the following spectra were compared with those acquired in figs s7 s9 product g and k were tentatively identified to be the sulfate conjugated hydroxy e1 product l was determined to be sulfate conjugated keto e1 products h i j and m were uncertain to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of sulfate conjugated hydroxy e1 and sulfate conjugated keto e1 as important biodegradation products of e2 3s the formation of multiple sulfate conjugated metabolites explained to some degree why percentages of e1 declined as the initial concentration of fortified e2 3s rose as exhibited in fig 2 based on the tentatively identified and confirmed metabolites tentative pathways describing conjugate degradation were proposed in fig 5 the degradation of e2 3g occurred mostly through oxidation of metabolites e2 and or e1 via hydroxylation desaturation and lactonization to form hydroxy e1 9 11 dehydro e1 and estrolactone keto e1 could be converted from hdyroxy e1 or directly from e2 li et al 2012 further degradation could be promoted by ring cleavage unlike e2 3g the degradation of e2 3s features the formation of different sulfate conjugate intermediates accompanied by the dissipation of e1 3s e2 3s was initially oxidized to e1 3s which was partially deconjugated to form e1 while considerable part of it was hydroxylated and ketonized understandable since sulfated estrogens are relatively recalcitrant due to limited arylsulfatase activity in the environment d ascenzo et al 2003 kumar et al 2012 scherr et al 2008 4 conclusions this study reports for the first time the degradation and new metabolite formation of e2 3g and e2 3s in river water environment results showed faster degradation rates in sediment than in river water for glucuronide conjugate than for sulfate conjugate and at low fortification level than at high level which were likely attributable to biomass densities it is clearly that low biomass availability and higher estrogen conjugate loadings prolonged their persistence also environmentally occurred estrogen conjugates could persist in river water for long 9 days for e2 3g and 14 days for e2 3s therefore existing conjugates may serve as sources of free estrogens via gradual liberation of free estrogens during the time course of their persistence new metabolites formed via hydroxylation dehydrogenation lactonization and ketonization in addition to de conjugation and the biologically active part of the estrogen structure is still preserved some of the metabolites appeared to be labile since they existed in a transitional manner but their role in the biodegradation of estrogen conjugates remains to be elucidated the negligible presence of e1 3g and e2 as primary metabolites respectively of e2 3g and e2 3s seems to be in a worse situation as e1 3g itself does not contribute to estrogenicity substituting e1 3g with e2 enhances the estrogenicity while the exclusive formation of e1 3s tends to prolong the estrogenicity because e1 3s is more persistent than e2 however since we didn t monitor the time course of estrogenicity this assumption remains untested in addition we only utilized sandy sediment in the study whether other sediment exhibits similar degradation behavior is unknown the study involved the degradation behavior in aerobic condition air exchange while real field condition could be a bit different since anaerobic condition may exist de conjugation could play a role for e2 3s under anaerobic condition therefore a parallel field study needs to be conducted in the future to obtain a better comparison acknowledgements this work was supported by the

19554,laboratory degradation tests with two model estrogen conjugates 17ß estradiol 3 glucuronide e2 3g and 17ß estradiol 3 sulphate e2 3s using river water and sediment as inoculum under aerobic conditions were investigated throughout the 14 day incubation degradation of e2 3g in river water at environmentally relevant level 25 ng l obeyed first order kinetics with the formation of 17 ß estradiol and estrone in contrast e2 3s was slowly converted to estrone 3 sulphate stoichiometrically degradation of the two conjugates across the spiking concentrations 0 01 1 μg g was much faster in sediment than in river water where 25 ng l of conjugate standards were spiked possibly due to relatively high population densities of microorganisms in sediment de conjugation of the thio ester bond at c 3 position and oxidation at c 17 position were the predominant degradation mechanisms for e2 3g and e2 3s respectively with negligible presence of metabolites estrone 3 glucuronide for e2 3g and 17ß estradiol for e2 3s in addition delta 9 11 dehydroestrone and 6 ketoestrone were determined as new metabolites of the two conjugates also a lactone compound hydroxylated estrone and a few sulfate conjugates were tentatively identified with the observation of new metabolites biodegradation pathways of e2 3g and e2 3s were proposed the formation of new metabolites may pose unknown risks to

disrupting compounds which could exert adverse effects on aquatic wildlife at environmentally relevant ng l level including intersexuality feminization and reproductive and behavioral problems jobling et al 1998 2006 kidd et al 2007 pelissero et al 1993 estrogens exhibit up to thousands times higher estrogenic potency than other major pharmaceuticals and personal care products as reflected by their predicted no effect concentration values li et al 2013 or the yeast estrogen screen results beek et al 2006 yost et al 2013 estrogens were frequently detected at low concentrations in the range of ng l to μg l in surface waters kolpin et al 2002 belfroid et al 1999 khanal et al 2006 ma et al 2016 gorga et al 2015 consequently investigation of estrogen contamination has drawn worldwide attention in the past few decades the routine administration of sex hormones to human and livestock as medicine leads to large estrogen loadings to environment it has been revealed that estrogen hormones were excreted in significant amounts from vertebrates in biologically inactive conjugates d ascenzo et al 2003 hanselman et al 2003 estrogen sulfate or glucuronide conjugation at c 3 and c 17 position of the basic parent estrogen structure commonly exist in the environment the sulfate or glucuronide moieties make the estrogen conjugates more water soluble and mobile posing an environmental risk once they are hydrolyzed to biologically active free estrogens khanal et al 2006 pinto et al 2014 nazari and suja 2016 estrogen conjugates enter the aqueous environment through sewage discharge and animal waste disposal a substantial portion can be converted back to their parent forms somewhere before and or after entering sewage treatment plants stps kumar et al 2012 liu et al 2015 arylsulfatase and ß glucuronidase enzymes synthesized by escherichia coli were suggested to be responsible for the de conjugation of estrogen sulfate and glucuronide respectively ternes et al 1999 duong et al 2011 estrogen conjugates normally occurred in wastewater treatment effluents at up to several ng l with estrogen sulfate outweighing glucuronide ma et al 2016 ben et al 2017 naldi et al 2016 animal waste disposal could cause considerable conjugate loadings to surface water considering one third of total estrogens in waste holding ponds of concentrated animal feeding operations were detected as conjugates hutchins et al 2007 for example up to 26 8 ng l of 17ß estradiol 3 sulphate e2 3s was observed in an agricultural watershed receiving poultry litter dutta et al 2012 estrogen conjugates that survive decomposition or bypass stp treatment enter river water and could liberate free estrogens and various intermediates with blurry biological activity leading to potential risks following water reuse however the majority of studies on estrogen conjugates to date have focused on their fate and degradation behavior based on laboratory batch studies using soil or activated sludge as incubation media chen and hu 2009 scherr et al 2008 2009 shrestha et al 2012 bai et al 2013 or in aqueous media on their occurrence and removal efficiency ma et al 2016 d ascenzo et al 2003 reddy et al 2005 griffith et al 2014 kumar et al 2011 in contrast relatively little is known about their degradation behavior and transformative pathways in river water environment the main goal of the study was to investigate the degradation of two model conjugates 17ß estradiol 3 glucuronide e2 3g and e2 3s and their transformation products in river water and sediment the degradation behavior of the two conjugates was investigated in river water at environmentally relevant ng l level and in sediment at three amendment levels finally degradation mechanisms were proposed electrospray collision induced dissociation cid tandem mass spectrometry together with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms were used for structure elucidation of metabolites at a specific degradation time knowledge on degradation kinetics and the formation of microbial metabolites is important for assessing the environmental behavior of estrogen conjugates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical standards

spectrum interpretation 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerobic degradation in river water the time course for e2 3g and e2 3s degradation in river water is illustrated in fig 1 comparison of their degradation trend against sterile controls suggests that biodegradation is mainly responsible for the loss of estrogen conjugates degradation of e2 3g obeys simple first order exponential kinetic model the calculated degradation rate constant k and half life t1 2 were 0 0355 h 1 and 18 h respectively kumar et al 2012 also recorded a similar half life of 15 4 h for e2 3g 370 ng l in incubated river water about half of fortified e2 3g was removed within the first day and was non detectable after 9 days of incubation suggesting that even at the environmentally relevant ng l level e2 3g can still be transformed the loss of e2 3g was accompanied by the concomitant formation of the primary degradation product e2 which was further oxidized to e1 the maximum percentage of e2 3g converted to e2 was 34 equal to 56 in molar percent estrone approached a plateau accounting for 20 over the period of 4 9 d the absence of e1 3g suggests that the dominant degradation pathway for e2 3g under the present conditions was hydrolysis of the thio ester bond at the c 3 position rather than oxidation at c 17 position degradation of e2 3s was much slower than e2 3g and the removal of e2 3s was concurrent with the sole detection of e1 3s fig 1b with 19 of e2 3s remaining after 14 days the molar percentages similar to weight percentages of e2 3s and e1 3s summed to around unity and remained unchanged for 9 days implying a stoichiometric conversion of e2 3s to e1 3s initially the two represented 83 of the original conjugates after 14 days to our knowledge this is likely the first study of degradation of e2 3s in river water at such low levels therefore hardly any other finding with this regard can be used for comparison however the stoichiometric oxidation at the c 17 site for e2 3s was also observed for e2 as investigated by yu et al 2007 who ascribed the pattern to the inability of the e2 degraders to catalyze the metabolite e1 while based on the previous results in a e2 3s degradation study that as arylsulphatase i e arylsulfatase was inhibited the formation and persistence of the major metabolite e1 3s were more pronounced scherr et al 2009 the slow degradation and accumulation of e1 3s in our study were expected since arylsulfatase in river water would be at insufficient levels in contrast to e2 3g e2 3s underwent a 2 day lag phase indicative that acclimation was necessary for the micro organisms to adapt before degradation began similar result was reported by d ascenzo et al 2003 who investigated the degradation behavior of e2 3s at an initial concentration of 25 μg l in domestic wastewater and also observed a 10 h of lag phase prior to progressive biodegradation after the lag phase degradation of e2 3s generally followed a linear trend other sulfate conjugate such as 17α estradiol 3 sulfate zheng et al 2013 in diluted dairy wastewater also displayed similar degradation profile aerobically these results are in line with the incomplete transformation of sulfate conjugate in stps kumar et al 2012 and its frequent detection in aqueous environments ma et al 2016 isobe et al 2003 3 2 aerobic degradation in sediment as illustrated in fig 2 the rapid depletion in the nonsterile treatments and the lack of abiotic loss in the sterile controls suggest that sorption to sediment is minimum while microorganisms play a key role in the dissipation of e2 3g and e2 3s in sediment the data all fit well to a simple first order kinetic model for three amendment levels and corresponding model parameters are presented in table 1 the half lives table 1 ranged respectively 0 81 3 94 h for e2 3g and 3 11 22 36 h for e2 3s table 1 which are within the range reported in raw sewage kumar et al 2012 and in soils scherr et al 2009 shrestha et al 2012 one conspicuous finding is as the initial concentration of e2 3g or e2 3s increased k value decreased table 1 such degradation trend was also reported before for e2 3g and e2 3s in agricultural soils soil slurries or moist soil shrestha et al 2012 ma and yates 2017 and activated sludge ng ml to μg ml range ternes et al 1999 elsewhere the inversed trend was proposed by marcus and talalay 1955 to be explained by the formation of nonactivated biomolecular complexes enzyme substrate complex involving two substrate molecules when degradation of testosterone and related androgens by a purified bacteria enzyme was investigated conversely chen and hu 2009 observed an increasing k value with increasing initial concentrations of e2 3g and e2 3s 10 400 μg l in sludge slurries apart from the stimulatory effect of high initial substrate concentration on the microorganisms the researchers provided a possible reason that the degradation intermediates of the conjugates did not compete with amended compound itself for binding with degraders because the activated sludge with relatively high concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids in the study would carry large bacterial population and result in effective degradation of the conjugates and their metabolites even at high initial concentration the explanation can be supported by the findings in another study that the first order rate constant k of e2 3s was significantly correlated to soil organic carbon content r 0 978 p 0 1 and to soil microbial biomass carbon r 0 995 p 0 05 scherr et al 2009 in our case the conjugates and their metabolites serving as carbon source could be saturated for microbiota in the sandy sediment major degradation products of the two conjugates were displayed in subfigures of fig 2 as initial concentration increased there was an overall increase some broadening and late arrival of the metabolite peaks a further hint that the metabolites together with their amended compounds as substrate could be saturated for the microbiota additionally degradation rate of the conjugates and their major metabolites at the medium initial level 0 1 μg g was close to that at the lowest level 0 01 μg g while the difference gap widened as concentration scale become larger 1 μg g the finding is comparable to the previous observation that between 0 03 and 10 μg l estrogen was degraded at similar rates in sewage while the rate was obviously slowed when estrogen concentration reached 100 μg l xu et al 2009 this was ascribed by the investigator to the possible availability of a key cometabolite at 100 μg l concentration limiting estrogen removal the figure also indicates that the metabolites at the highest initial concentration in particular persisted longer with certain amount detected at the end of the incubation the conversion of e2 3g to e2 was not complete as e2 accounted for 6 17 approximate 8 22 molar percent of original fortified conjugate at the highest point earlier 6 formation of e2 from e2 3g was reported in incubated surface soils shrestha et al 2012 ma and yates 2017 similar to the case in river water no discernable proportion of e1 3g was detected fig s3 nevertheless the absence of e1 3g seems counter to intuition given a wide range of bacteria was responsible for oxidation of e2 to e1 at c 17 position yu et al 2007 colucci et al 2001 jiang et al 2010 tanaka et al 2009 moreover prior batch studies of e2 3g degradation in soils observed considerable quantities of e1 3g shrestha et al 2012 this observation suggests that transformation mechanisms of estrogen conjugates in river water could be different from other compartments possibly due to differences of microbial population densities types and activeness as well as the dissolved oxygen content in the incubation media the proportions of e1 3s converted from e2 3s accounted for 33 100 of the applied e2 3s similar to the range of 55 100 reported by scherr et al 2009 in a soil microcosm study since the formation of e2 was trivial 0 3 fig s4 the secondary metabolite e1 8 was thus converted from e1 3s the low proportions of e1 and e2 in the present study as metabolites of e2 3s are congruent with a prior batch study with raw sewage and river water kumar et al 2012 indicative oxidation as the predominant transformation pathway of e2 3s in river sediment another noticeable finding is the maximum proportion of e1 decreased as the initial concentration of fortified e2 3s rose suggested that other transformation pathways become more important than de conjugation when e1 3s as substrate is saturated the formation of new metabolites of e1 3s with high level 10 μg g of e2 3s amended discussed in the next section provides certain evidence for this if this were the case degradation of e1 3s may not simply form e1 in particular when the initial concentration is high while other metabolites might need to be calculated for modelling and risk assessment 3 3 new metabolite formation in addition to the abovementioned general metabolites microbial assisted degradation of e2 3g in the sediment leads to four new products as indicated on the gc ms chromatograms fig 3 a these degradation metabolites are labeled herein asⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ the mass spectra of the new products were subject to nist library searching by comparison tms derivatives of products ⅱand ⅲ exhibited highly similar fragment patterns to that of 9 11 dehydro e1 and 6 keto e1 respectively fig s5 and the tms derivatives of the authentic standards also showed identical retention times and spectra figure not shown productsⅱand ⅲ were thus determined to be 9 11 dehydro e1 and 6 keto e1 respectively with respect to the tms derivatives of productⅰ molecular ion at m z 430 and ⅳ molecular ion at m z 358 no corresponding tms derivatives with similar mass spectra in the library were found however their spectra suggested that they could have two and one oh moieties respectively to react with bstfa herein a molecular ion at m z 286 430 2h 2tms forⅰand 358 h tms for ⅳ was tentatively assigned to productⅰand ⅳ to assist identification the underivatized counterpart of the sediment extract was reanalyzed and one new peak in the extract with a retention time of 15 33 min and a molecular ion at m z 286 showed its mass spectra identical to that of estrolactone with one oh group attached fig s6 product ⅳ was therefore tentatively identified to be estrolactone the structure of productⅰwas unclear nevertheless the molecular ion m z 430 represents 14 with respect to that of derivatized e2 m z 272 2h 2tms possibly corresponding to keto e2 or oh substituted e1 based on the peak areas yields of product ⅱand ⅲ peaked around 72 144 h of incubation according to our knowledge estrolactone as a biodegradation product of either e2 3g or e2 has never been reported before a similar metabolite with a lactone structure at the d ring was proposed as a biodegradation product of e2 lee and liu 2002 keto e1 has been tentatively identified as degradation intermediate of e2 by soil isolates of rhodococcus sp and sphingomonas sp kurisu et al 2010 9 11 dehydro e1 was not reported as estrogen metabolites by others although data was simultaneously collected on hplc using mass and uv detector the uv spectra fig 3b for e2 3g were included here since the spectra were able to show the new metabolites product a to f clearly these degradation metabolites are labelled herein as a f to differentiate them from gc ms peaks the ambiguous identification of different metabolites was achieved via the application of cid fragmentation mechanisms a precursor ion of each new metabolite selected based on the full scan spectra was subject to cid in a product ion scan mode and the subclass precursor normally a product ion with the greatest signal intensity was selected for further fragmentation corresponding spectra of all new products listed in alphabetical order were shown in fig s7 products b and f with pseudomolecular ions m h at m z 283 and 267 were identified to be 6 keto e1 and 9 11 dehydro e1 in accordance to product ⅲ and ⅱby gc ms respectively considering the identical cid spectra fig s8 and retention times with that of the standards without an authentic reference compound structure of other products can only be tentatively deducted from their molecular ions and fragmentation patterns product a and c with a pseudomolecular ion m h at m z 285 upon cid exhibited a characteristic ion at m z 267 which can be explained by a neutral loss of h2o to form a double bond implying there is an second oh group in the structure in addition to the existing one at c 3 position considering water loss from the aromatic ring is not favored and the subsequent fragmentation pattern of the ion at m z 267 is similar to that of 8 9 dehydro e1 fig s9 and 9 11 dehydro e1 fig s8 authentic standards the second oh is likely located at b or c ring formation of major fragments m z 251 237 223 209 195 and 171 of the ion at m z 267 was proposed as shown in fig s7 we determined product a and c to be hydroxy e1 although the position of the oh group is not located b ring or c ring oh substituted e1 hasn t been reported to be potential microbial degradation product of e2 or e1 in soil environment however hydroxylation of e2 and or e1 at various positions was reviewed by zhu and conney 1998 to be catalyzed by enzymes present in animal or human tissues as exemplified by human cytochrome p450 enzymes in the current study hydroxylation could be performed by soil bacteria as soil bacterial isolates were reported to oxidize e2 or e1 via hydroxylation at a or d ring which is then followed by ring cleavage kurisu et al 2010 casas campillo and bautista 1965 products d and e were not identified in the present study due to limited data available like e2 3g e2 3s showed the presence of 6 keto e1 9 11 dehydro e1 and estrolactone as potential degradation products on gc ms chromatograms fig s10 nevertheless the hplc ms ms spectra suggested of additional distinctive products fig 4 products g m have pseudomolecular ions m h at m z 365 or 363 which were selected as initial precursor ions for fragmentation fig s11 the formation of characteristic ions at m z 267 m hso3 h2o 285 m hso3 or 283 m hso3 and 80 so3 suggested products g m should be all sulfate conjugated metabolites to elucidate the structure of the products those characteristic ions m z 267 285 and 283 were fragmented further and the following spectra were compared with those acquired in figs s7 s9 product g and k were tentatively identified to be the sulfate conjugated hydroxy e1 product l was determined to be sulfate conjugated keto e1 products h i j and m were uncertain to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of sulfate conjugated hydroxy e1 and sulfate conjugated keto e1 as important biodegradation products of e2 3s the formation of multiple sulfate conjugated metabolites explained to some degree why percentages of e1 declined as the initial concentration of fortified e2 3s rose as exhibited in fig 2 based on the tentatively identified and confirmed metabolites tentative pathways describing conjugate degradation were proposed in fig 5 the degradation of e2 3g occurred mostly through oxidation of metabolites e2 and or e1 via hydroxylation desaturation and lactonization to form hydroxy e1 9 11 dehydro e1 and estrolactone keto e1 could be converted from hdyroxy e1 or directly from e2 li et al 2012 further degradation could be promoted by ring cleavage unlike e2 3g the degradation of e2 3s features the formation of different sulfate conjugate intermediates accompanied by the dissipation of e1 3s e2 3s was initially oxidized to e1 3s which was partially deconjugated to form e1 while considerable part of it was hydroxylated and ketonized understandable since sulfated estrogens are relatively recalcitrant due to limited arylsulfatase activity in the environment d ascenzo et al 2003 kumar et al 2012 scherr et al 2008 4 conclusions this study reports for the first time the degradation and new metabolite formation of e2 3g and e2 3s in river water environment results showed faster degradation rates in sediment than in river water for glucuronide conjugate than for sulfate conjugate and at low fortification level than at high level which were likely attributable to biomass densities it is clearly that low biomass availability and higher estrogen conjugate loadings prolonged their persistence also environmentally occurred estrogen conjugates could persist in river water for long 9 days for e2 3g and 14 days for e2 3s therefore existing conjugates may serve as sources of free estrogens via gradual liberation of free estrogens during the time course of their persistence new metabolites formed via hydroxylation dehydrogenation lactonization and ketonization in addition to de conjugation and the biologically active part of the estrogen structure is still preserved some of the metabolites appeared to be labile since they existed in a transitional manner but their role in the biodegradation of estrogen conjugates remains to be elucidated the negligible presence of e1 3g and e2 as primary metabolites respectively of e2 3g and e2 3s seems to be in a worse situation as e1 3g itself does not contribute to estrogenicity substituting e1 3g with e2 enhances the estrogenicity while the exclusive formation of e1 3s tends to prolong the estrogenicity because e1 3s is more persistent than e2 however since we didn t monitor the time course of estrogenicity this assumption remains untested in addition we only utilized sandy sediment in the study whether other sediment exhibits similar degradation behavior is unknown the study involved the degradation behavior in aerobic condition air exchange while real field condition could be a bit different since anaerobic condition may exist de conjugation could play a role for e2 3s under anaerobic condition therefore a parallel field study needs to be conducted in the future to obtain a better comparison acknowledgements this work was supported by the
