19305,cell based metabolomics was used in a proof of concept fashion to investigate the biological effects of contaminants as they traveled from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharge to a drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake in a surface water usage cycle zebrafish liver zfl cells were exposed to water samples collected along a surface water flowpath where a wwtp was located 14 5 km upstream of a dwtp the sampling sites included 1 upstream of the wwtp 2 the wwtp effluent discharging point 3 a proximal location downstream of the wwtp outfall 4 a distal location downstream of the wwtp outfall 5 the drinking water intake and 6 the treated drinking water collected prior to discharge to the distribution system after a 48 h laboratory exposure the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites in zfl cell extracts were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms respectively multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct changes in metabolite profiles in response to wwtp effluent exposure these effects on the hydrophilic metabolome gradually diminished downstream of the wwtp becoming non significant at the drinking water intake comparable to upstream of the wwtp p 0 98 however effects on the lipophilic metabolome increased significantly as the river flowed from the distal location downstream of the wwtp to the drinking water intake p 0 001 suggesting a source of bioactive compounds in this watershed other than the wwtp zfl cells exposed to treated drinking water did not exhibit significant changes in either the hydrophilic p 0 15 or lipophilic metabolome p 0 83 compared to the upstream site suggesting that constituents in the wwtp effluent were efficiently removed by the drinking water treatment process impacts on zfl cells from the wwtp effluent included disrupted energy metabolism a global decrease in amino acids and altered lipid metabolism pathways overall this study demonstrated the utility of cell based metabolomics as an effective tool for assessing the biological effects of complex pollutant mixtures particularly when used as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring graphical abstract image 1 keywords metabolomics cell culture wastewater treatment plant effluent potable reuse water quality 1 introduction the past several decades have witnessed a rapidly increasing demand for water resources due to global economic development and an ever increasing population in many densely populated or arid regions the lack of sufficient potable water has led to the use of treated wastewater e g discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps for many non potable applications such as agricultural and landscape irrigations and groundwater recharge usda 2013 usepa 2004 unfortunately the discharge of treated wastewater into natural systems e g rivers and lakes has also inadvertently resulted in introduction of a complex mixture of organic contaminants to local aquatic ecosystems and importantly surface water derived drinking water supplies this use of treated wastewater after mixing with receiving waters has been referred to as de facto unplanned potable reuse by a national academy of engineering study nrc 2012 it was estimated recently that 50 of 2056 surface water intakes that serve 1210 drinking water treatment plants dwtps across the u s are potentially affected by upstream wwtp discharges rice and westerhoff 2015 wwtp effluent is one of the main sources of contaminants of emerging concern cecs to surface waters kolpin et al 2002 cecs comprise a wide variety of chemicals including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs disinfection by products dbps antibiotics and pesticides many cecs have been reported to cause adverse ecotoxicological effects at environmentally relevant concentrations raising concerns over their presence in receiving waters david et al 2018 kolpin et al 2002 adding to these concerns are the growing number of instances in which these same surface waters are used as drinking water sources i e de facto water reuse to date there have been a limited number of studies demonstrating the influence of wwtp effluent on the quality of drinking water sources boleda et al 2009 guo and krasner 2009 rodayan et al 2016 for example under extremely low streamflow conditions some dwtp intakes could contain almost 100 wwtp discharge that is complete de facto reuse rice et al 2013 and the concentrations of some ppcps at dwtp intakes have been comparable to those from upstream wwtp effluents guo and krasner 2009 this is potentially concerning given that other studies have shown incomplete 90 removal of many cecs during the drinking water treatment process including benzoylecgonine 2 ethylidene 1 5 dimethyl 3 3 diphenylpyrrolidine methadone cocaine methylenedioxyamphetamine ephedrine and several prescription opioids boleda et al 2009 rodayan et al 2016 the presence of these and many other cecs in streams receiving wwtp effluent coupled with the potential for their incomplete removal during the drinking water treatment process poses a signifcant and increasing challenge to chemical risk assessment indeed the vast number of chemicals in wastewater has far exceeded our analytical capability based on individual targeted analysis nrc 2007 moreover there remains a dearth of information regarding the toxic modes of action moas of most targeted chemicals this implies an even greater level of uncertainty when unidentified contaminants are considered judson et al 2009 the limited understanding of how individual chemical toxicities are modified when chemicals occur in very complex mixtures at environmental conditions further complicates the risk assessment process schwarzenbach et al 2006 to address these and other limitations of the conventional targeted chemical monitoring approach a variety of biological effects based tools have emerged and have increasingly been used in water quality assessment escher and leusch 2012 these tools include bioassays that target specific biological activities such as estrogenic or androgenic receptor binding escher and leusch 2012 more recently omics tools that analyze gene transcripts proteins and or endogenous metabolites have gained popularity for moa assessments of individual chemicals as well as complex environmental mixtures davis et al 2017 skelton et al 2014 xia et al 2017 these effects based tools are particularly attractive as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring because they are both open ended i e untargeted and they provide insights into the biological impacts of complex mixtures even when the individual contaminants cannot be uniquely identified or quantified due to advantages that have been discussed elsewhere bundy et al 2009 lankadurai et al 2013 metabolomics has been shown to be a particularly useful omics approach for evaluating comprehensive biological responses to various environmental stressors for example this approach has been extensively employed to investigate the moas of various xenobiotics including nanoparticles ratnasekhar et al 2015 ppcps gomez canela et al 2016 and edcs davis et al 2017 through laboratory based animal e g rodents fish and invertebrates exposures in addition field based metabolomics assessments using on site exposure of fish have been used successfully to investigate the biological effect of complex contaminant mixtures discharging from both point e g wwtp effluent and non point sources davis et al 2013 skelton et al 2014 however metabolomics studies that employ live animals are labor and resource intensive and typically require lethal sampling to collect the relevant tissues and or biofluids in an effort to circumvent these drawbacks we previously developed a cell culture based metabolomics method and applied it to investigate the effect s of exposure to 17α ethynylestradiol on zebrafish danio rerio liver zfl cells teng et al 2013 our findings showed that the cellular responses agreed with those metabolite changes observed in vivo teng et al 2013 this suggested that cell based metabolomics approaches have the potential of providing valuable ecotoxicological information in a particularly high throughput and cost effective manner in the current study the zfl cell based metabolomics approach was extended to investigate the biological effect s of a wwtp effluent discharged into a stream and further downstream to a dwtp in a de facto potable reuse cycle previously zebrafish has been identified as a model vertebrate for investigating chemical toxicity both in vivo and in vitro and proven highly relevant for both human and ecological health dai et al 2014 the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cell based metabolomics for tracking the biological effects of contaminants as they travel from the wwtp to the corresponding downstream dwtp as well as the final drinking water product a second goal was to test the applicability and efficacy of cell based metabolomics for ecological assessments of complex environmental mixtures and to identify relationships between metabolomics endpoints and conventional contaminant detections 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations in april 2015 water samples were taken from a stretch of a river in the northeastern usa where a wwtp is located 14 5 km upstream of the intake of a dwtp the relative locations of all six sampling sites are shown in fig 1 grab samples were collected upstream ups of the wwtp at the effluent pipe efp of the wwtp a proximal location downstream of the wwtp outfall emz where the effluent is well mixed with the river as demonstrated by conductivity a distal location downstream of the wwtp outfall dns at the drinking water intake dwi and from treated drinking water tdw collected from the clear well just prior to discharge to the distribution system the ups site was located 1 2 km upstream of efp while emz dns and dwi were 0 7 9 1 and 14 5 km respectively downstream from efp the travel times of water from ups to efp emz dns dwi and tdw including residence times in the dwtp were estimated to be 0 8 1 3 7 2 10 9 and 18 9 h respectively no precipitation was reported during the period of sampling susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 the wwtp effluent flow 1 7 ft3 s was less than 1 of the flow of river water 1179 ft3 s average of measurements at three different locations along this segment of river during sample collection indicating a low magnitude of de facto potable reuse in the study area rice and westerhoff 2015 all samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles placed immediately on ice shipped overnight and stored at 20 c additional descriptions of the wwtp and dwtp are provided in supporting information 2 2 culturing of zfl cells and exposure experimental design zfl cells crl 2643 atcc manassas va were cultivated at 28 c in a humidified atmosphere as monolayer cultures in medium see the supporting information for medium composition prepared according to atcc s instructions www atcc org to prepare zfl cells for exposure four t75 flasks of cells were harvested after they reached 100 confluence cells were combined and evenly distributed to 49 culture dishes there were seven biological replicates for each of six sampling locations and the laboratory control for precultivation at 28 c for 48 h for cell exposure experiments the cell culture medium was displaced with the prepared mixed exposure medium made from the field collected grab samples specifically a medium based on the composition as described in the supporting information but at a four fold higher concentration was prepared this concentrated medium was mixed in a ratio of 1 3 with a filtered 0 1 μm water sample from each field site or with purified water ultrapure type 1 18 2 mω cm 0 1 μm filtered aqua solutions jasper ga usa that served as the laboratory control con thus the final concentrations of environmental samples in the exposure medium were 75 of the concentrations in the initial field collected water samples cells were then incubated at 28 c for 48 h before quenching cytotoxicity of water samples was tested based on a previously published protocol feoktistova et al 2016 no significant p 0 05 cytotoxic effects were observed for cells exposed to environmental samples vs con see the supporting information for details of the assay 2 3 extraction and analysis of intracellular metabolites a direct quenching method that was developed in our laboratory was applied to quench zfl cells after the 48 h exposure teng et al 2009 the intracellular metabolites were further extracted using a dual phase method that was published previously teng et al 2013 a bi phasic mixture was generated at the end of extraction and further separated into two fractions that contained mainly hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites respectively both fractions of cell extracts were dried using a vacuum concentrator thermo electron waltham ma usa after that the hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions of cell extracts from individual biological replicates were analyzed with an inova 600 mhz nmr spectrometer agilent santa clara ca usa and a gas chromatograph connected to a single quadrupole mass spectrometer in full scan mode thermo trace 1310 and isq waltham ma usa respectively additional descriptions of metabolite extraction and nmr and gc ms data acquisitions are provided in the supporting information 2 4 nmr data processing the nmr spectra were processed with 0 3 hz apodization after removing the residual solvent the spectra were binned at a width of 0 005 ppm within the range of 0 50 10 00 ppm the binned data were imported into microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa usa and normalized to unit total integrated intensity for subsequent analysis 2 5 gc ms data processing the metalign software package wageningen university netherlands was used to perform baseline correction background and noise reduction peak smoothing and selection and retention time alignment with gc ms chromatograms lommen and kools 2012 peaks with signal to noise s n ratios less than three were rejected ion groups were assembled into metabolites using the msclust software package wageningen university netherlands and unique ions for each metabolite were used for relative quantification tikunov et al 2012 artifact peaks arising from the derivatization reagent column bleed as well as peaks observed in method blanks were excluded only metabolites consistently detected in at least 80 of samples in at least one of the six sites or con were retained metabolites with relative standard deviations rsd of greater than 30 in the quality control samples were excluded from the final dataset putative annotation of metabolites was conducted by comparing the retention index δ of 10 and ei mass spectrum similarity 70 to those recorded in the nist05 wiley 7 and golm metabolome database mass spectral libraries or those obtained from the standards injection following these steps the final dataset contained a total of 107 unique metabolites 32 of which were annotated 5 at level i and 27 at level ii as defined by the metabolomics standard initiative msi www metabolomics msi org normalized abundance relative to a constant sum of all detected metabolites was performed for each sample prior to statistical analyses 2 6 statistical analysis multivariate analyses with nmr and gc ms data were conducted with simca version 14 1 umetrics umea sweden the nmr data were mean centered and pareto scaled while the gc ms data were mean centered and scaled to unit variance principal component analysis pca models were built with all data points and outliers were defined as those points that fell out of the 95 confidence interval of a hotellings t2 test anova with tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test was performed for multiple group comparison of pca scores on the first and second components for analysis of the nmr and gc ms data a student s t test was performed to compare the normalized abundance of individual metabolites between a given site and the control using the results of this analysis we generated t test filtered difference spectra by subtracting averaged relative abundances of the control from those of a given site in addition we calculated the fold change of lipophilic metabolites that exhibited significant difference between a sampling site and the control comparisons were also carried out with a selection of lipophilic metabolites to investigate the abundance change across all sites by applying anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test overall a significance level of 0 05 was set for all statistical tests in this study more details on generating these difference spectra including the strategies for controlling false positives with multiple t tests and across site comparisons are provided in supporting information a bioactivity network was built based on significantly changed p 0 05 and annotated metabolites using the open source software cytoscape www cytoscape org all data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the main text and supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of metabolite profiles of zfl cells following exposure to water from each site pca score plots displayed an overall alteration of metabolite profiles of zfl cells following exposure to field water samples relative to controls fig 2 distinct separations across several of the sampling sites was achieved in the first component of pca score plots for both hydrophilic fig 2a and lipophilic fig 2b sample extracts anova with post hoc tukey s hsd analysis was applied to evaluate the significance of metabolite profile differences between individual sites using the pca scores of the first two components table s1 water collected from the ups site shows discernible differences in metabolome profiles of zfl cells relative to con in both score plots pc1 p 0 039 in fig 2a p 0 005 in fig 2b this is perhaps not surprising since there are several known potential sources of contamination i e wwtps located upstream of ups in addition as with all field collected waters this sample contained natural constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom that were absent in con it is reasonable to suspect that these natural constituents were also contributing to the cellular metabolic changes observed at ups for example dom in natural waters was shown to have a significant effect on the metabolic energy status of daphnia pulex pulicaria taylor et al 2016 however it is notable that in other similar field studies we have seen no separation in pc1 for score plots similarly generated by nmr analysis of the polar fraction of a relatively pristine field water vs a similarly prepared lab control quincy teng personal communication july 25th 2018 this suggests that the known potential sources of contamination located upstream from the current study sites are indeed contributing to the metabolite marker profiles at ups the water sample collected at efp reflected the most distinct change in metabolome profile among all sites based on the extent of its separation from con along pc1 in both hydrophilic and lipophilic score plots this effect decreased but not significantly at emz which was proximal below the outfall pc1 p 0 77 in fig 2a p 0 57 in fig 2b emz vs efp and where dilution of effluent with river water had taken place as water flowed further downstream the zfl cells exhibited different patterns of change in the hydrophilic metabolome as compared to the lipophilic metabolome specifically the effects of dns and dwi observed in the hydrophilic extracts significantly decreased relative to the effect of emz fig 2a pc1 p 0 007 for dns vs emz and p 0 007 for dwi vs emz in fact the pc1 score values for dns and dwi were coincident with those of ups for the score plot generated from the hydrophilic metabolome fig 2a conversely the effects observed in the dns and dwi lipophilic extracts were not significantly different from that of emz fig 2b pc1 p 0 799 for dns vs emz and p 1 for dwi vs emz and were significantly greater than that of ups pc1 p 0 001 for dns vs ups and p 0 001 for dwi vs ups finally the effect of tdw on the zfl metabolome was found to be generally comparable to that of ups based on pc1 score values in both pca plots however a statistically significant difference was observed when comparing pc1 scores of tdw and con from the score plot for the lipophilic metabolome fig 2a p 0 001 but not in the plot for the hydrophilic metabolome fig 2b p 0 78 tdw and con score values were significantly different along pc2 for the hydrophilic metabolome p 0 04 but not for the lipophilic metabolome p 0 691 it seems reasonable although untested that this difference in metabolite profiles between con and tdw could be caused by the ubiquitous occurrence of dbps in treated drinking water richardson and ternes 2014 for example similar findings were also reported in an earlier study showing higher baseline toxicity and neurotoxicity in treated drinking water compared with purified water when testing with a variety of bioanalytical tools macova et al 2011 to further investigate the site specific effects on both the zfl hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolomes we focused only on those metabolites that exhibited a statistically significant change in normalized abundance versus that of the controls p 0 05 the t test filtered difference spectra were generated for the hydrophilic extracts fig 3 and s1 as described in the materials and methods section consistent with the pca score plot fig 2a the efp and emz sites which are directly or indirectly affected by wwtp effluent exhibited a similar pattern of changes in the difference spectra with respect to the identity of changed hydrophilic metabolites and the magnitude of those changes the effects at other field sites were less than those observed at efp and emz based on the number and magnitude of altered metabolite peaks for the lipophilic extracts analyzed with gc ms a fold change plot was made for the exposure result for each site versus control see fig 4 for annotated metabolites fig s2 for a version displaying all metabolites there are 44 63 32 and 53 metabolites out of a total of 107 that exhibited significant changes in efp emz dns and dwi respectively versus con p 0 05 in agreement with the pca score plot these four sites exhibit similar patterns of metabolite changes fig s2 however several metabolites exhibited considerably greater increases in normalized abundance for the efp site than any metabolites at any of the other sites for the two least impacted sites ups and tdw only 13 and 19 metabolites respectively are found to change significantly in normalized abundance versus con p 0 05 in a further step we summed the absolute values of intensity differences of all peaks from the t test filtered difference spectra for zfl hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts and compared their magnitudes as a proxy for total impact from the exposure for each site fig 5 for both hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts efp was found to be the most affected site in agreement with the pca score plots fig 2 the level of dilution at the emz site did not result in a statistically significant attenuation p 0 08 for hydrophilic extracts and p 0 26 for lipophilic extracts still in general the effect of effluent from the wwtp gradually decreased along the direction of water flow particularly in the case of the hydrophilic extract fig 5a however we noted a discrepancy between the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolome at dwi where the integrated impact on hydrophilic metabolites was at the same level as that of ups fig 5a while the intensity change of the lipophilic metabolome for dwi was even greater than that observed at dns fig 5b note that as discussed above these trends were also observable in the score plots of fig 2 inconsistent effects on biological responses when looking at both the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites are not uncommon having also been reported for an in vivo exposure of fathead minnows pimephales promelas fhm that were caged at various locations near a wwtp skelton et al 2014 however it serves to reiterate the importance of capturing the greatest extent of the intracellular metabolome as possible as different classes of metabolites e g lipids amino acids carbohydrates can provide both complementary and disparate types of information an examination of the greater impact on the lipophilic metabolome of the zfl cells exposed to water from the dwi site suggests an additional source of environmental stressor s in the stretch of the river between dns and dwi that mainly affects lipid metabolism regardless of the source of the stressor s it appears that they are effectively eliminated during drinking water treatment based on a comparison of the summed integrated differences of tdw and dwi fig 5b indeed the data in fig 5 suggest that in this system the response in the zfl cells from the wwtp effluent is well controlled downstream through a combination of river dilution natural attenuation and existing drinking water treatment technologies 3 2 metabolic pathway perturbations observed in the hydrophilic zfl metabolome the combined metabolome changes as depicted in fig 2 through 5 suggest that wwtp effluent was the primary cause of the responses that we measured in this portion of the river system hence further analyses focused on the perturbed metabolic pathways associated with exposure to the effluent using these pathways a bioactivity network was built using a majority of the annotated metabolites fig 6 the complete list of affected metabolites is presented in tables s2 and s3 analysis of the bioactivity network revealed that several metabolites associated with energy metabolism in zfl were found to change substantially following exposure to the wwtp effluent efp for example the key entry and exit metabolites for the glycolysis pathway glucose and pyruvate respectively were found to decrease in the zfl metabolome following exposure this suggested a greater energetic demand by zfl cells when exposed to the complex mixtures in the effluent this hypothesis was further bolstered by findings in the nmr difference spectra of depleted cellular energy molecules axps atp adp amp see fig s1 in supporting information in keeping with increased cellular energy consumption udp glucose was also found to decrease following exposure to the efp site water samples udp glucose is the major form of glucose utilized in the synthesis of polysaccharides e g glycogen in biological cells a previous study showed that glucose starvation could result in udp glucose deficiency and inactivation of glycogen synthase higuita et al 2004 thus it appears that not only the short term energy balance was affected e g decreased glucose and nucleotides but potentially so were cellular reserves e g glycogen unfortunately due to the low levels of metabolites characteristic of zfl cells we were unable to evaluate effects on glycogen regardless the concomitant decreases in energetic metabolites in the hydrophilic metabolome suggests that glycogen effects may be observed in vivo oxidative degradation i e the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle was also affected by wwtp effluent exposure specifically the abundances of citrate and succinate were found decreased in the efp exposed cells compared to con conversely lactate the primary by product of fermentation i e homolactic fermentation was found to increase in cells that were exposed to water samples collected at the wwtp effluent discharging point a number of amino acids in zfl cells were decreased following wastewater exposure fig 6 specifically reductions in valine leucine isoleucine lysine threonine glutamine arginine tryptophan and phenylalanine were observed given the decreases measured in energetic metabolites glucose pyruvate etc the global decrease in amino acids is likely due in part to increased consumption by glycolysis and the tca cycle i e anaplerosis to sustain energy production exceptions to this apparent global decrease are the increases observed for glutamate and tyrosine in fact one of the most prominent metabolite changes following exposure to wwtp effluent is the increase of glutamate fig 3 which appeared to coincide with decreases in glutamine and glutathione these findings suggest disturbance of the glutamate metabolism pathway which could have multiple implications for cell viability and function newsholme et al 2003 as the hub of this pathway glutamate undergoes transformation to numerous other metabolites in order to meet the changing demands of the cell for example glutamate can influence the tca cycle through deamination to α ketoglutarate provide a readily available sink for excess nitrogen via its conversion to glutamine and support amino acid homeostasis furthermore as a component of the tripeptide glutathione glutamate is essential for defense against oxidative stressors e g free radicals peroxides and heavy metals newsholme et al 2003 the reduction in glutathione suggests the presence of components of the wwtp effluent mixture capable of inducing oxidative stress however exactly how this decline relates to the observed increase in glutamate is uncertain beyond energetic effects we also observed a large increase in choline cho and phosphocholine pcho in zfl cells from the efp site fig 3 cho and pcho are major components in the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids that determine the cell membrane fluidity and govern overall cell functions li and vance 2008 in biological cells pcho cho can either be acquired from the extracellular environment or produced de novo via the action of phospholipase an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine an important component of membrane phospholipids into fatty acids and other substances including cho and pcho li and vance 2008 the products from phospholipase action play critical roles in many physiological processes including the generation of signaling lipids as well as regulation of energy metabolism li and vance 2008 considering the close relationship between pcho cho levels and lipid homeostasis in biological cells such a large increase of pcho cho suggests considerable disturbance of lipid metabolism by the effluent exposure which we indeed observed in the lipophilic zfl metabolome figs 2b 4 and 5b 3 3 metabolic pathway perturbations observed in the lipophilic zfl metabolome guided in part by the large change of pcho cho levels in the hydrophilic zfl metabolome fig 3 we further analyzed the gc ms data to assess which lipid metabolism pathways were affected by exposing zfl cells to the wwtp effluent because 19 of the 21 annotated lipophilic metabolites fig 4 were classified as intermediates or end products in either cholesterol or fatty acid synthesis we focused our attention on the effects of exposure from the efp site water relative to con on these pathways specifically we first assessed the variation in abundances of cholesterol and its biosynthetic intermediates in the context of a bioactivity network cholesterol plays an essential role in vertebrate biochemistry and physiology maintaining the structural integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane and serving as the precursor for biosynthesis of steroid hormones vitamin d and bile acids van der wulp et al 2013 hence regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is of paramount importance in the current study we found that 14 demethyllanosterol significantly decreased p 0 01 while the levels of three other intermediate metabolites desmosterol lathosterol and 7 dehydrocholesterol 7 dhc were significantly elevated upon exposure to efp fig 6 p 0 001 for desmosterol p 0 002 for lathosterol and p 0 001 for 7 dhc it should be noted that the normalized abundance of 7 dhc was 102 times that of the con see fig 4 log2 fold change 6 7 however its downstream reaction product cholesterol was not significantly changed p 0 22 this pattern of metabolite changes has recently been reported with neuro2a cells that were exposed to over 30 different pharmacologically active compounds that were associated with inhibited conversion of 7 dhc to cholesterol via the enzyme 7 dhc reductase dhcr7 kim et al 2016 expression changes both increases and decreases in the transcript and or protein of dhcr7 has frequently been reported in aquatic species exposed to a range of environmental contaminants including cu santos et al 2010 linuron webster et al 2015 and 17α ethynylestradiol tompsett et al 2013 thus the marked change in 7 dhc observed here is not without some precedent and may represent a candidate marker for exposure to contaminated surface waters in regard to fatty acid metabolism we observed significant decreases in the normalized abundances of two saturated fatty acids sfa hexadecanoic acid c16 0 p 0 001 and octadecanoic acid c18 0 p 0 001 in efp exposed zfl cells relative to control fig 7 b for the monounsaturated fatty acids mufa it was found that hexadecenoic acid c16 1 abundance increased significantly p 0 02 after efp exposure fig 7c another commonly detected mufa octadecenoic acid c18 1 was also found to increase in normalized abundance upon efp exposure however this increase did not meet the threshold for statistical significance p 0 12 fig 7c as for the polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa the final dataset for the lipophilic metabolome contained only one metabolite octadecadienoic acid c18 2 and there was no significant difference p 0 81 in its normalized abundance between efp and con interestingly the sum of abundances of all detected fatty acids did not show a significant difference between efp and con p 0 65 this suggests that the combined pool of fatty acids in the zfl cells was at a steady state following efp exposure however looking more closely at the selectivity of responses with regard to extent of saturation suggests that exposure to the undiluted wastewater effluent from efp promoted the biotransformation of sfa to mufa mufa as opposed to sfa have been reported to have a protective effect on oxidative stress quiles et al 2006 and cellular inflammation liu et al 2011 previously a number of studies have reported elevated mufa levels across multiple species fish rodent and invertebrate that were exposed to environmental contaminants including 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzofuran zhang et al 2015 tributyltin janer et al 2007 and perfluorinated compounds wagbo et al 2012 considering the fact that wwtp effluent contains a complex mixture of numerous natural and xenobiotic compounds that may exert oxidative stress and or an inflammatory effect on zfl cells it is plausible that the elevated mufa level relative to sfa reflects the physiological status of zfl cells in combating both types of environmental stress in response to exposure to wwtp effluent 3 4 relating metabolite changes with chemicals detected at the wwtp site efp data from this study clearly show that the zfl cell metabolome was impacted to the greatest extent by direct exposure to wwtp effluent i e the efp site as discussed above many of the metabolite changes that were measured provide new or confirmatory knowledge regarding in vitro responses and demonstrate the value of cell based metabolomics for screening environmental surface waters note that water samples collected concurrently at the same study sites were analyzed for over 200 chemical pollutants that cover a wide variety of classes including antibiotics disinfection byproducts endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceutical compounds and inorganic compounds results will be published separately susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 using the targeted chemical analysis results we were able to establish potential links between a selection of chemicals and certain perturbed metabolic pathways that were observed in zfl cells following exposure to effluent from the efp site as discussed earlier one of the most distinct metabolite changes in efp exposed cells as opposed to other sites was the increase in the pcho cho level fig 3 which may indicate promoted phospholipase activity interestingly some of the pharmaceuticals detected above their minimum reporting levels only at the efp site including acetaminophen and fluoxetine have been reported to upregulate the activity of phospholipase for example acetaminophen was found to increase the expression of mrna for multiple members of the phospholipase family in mouse liver coen et al 2003 and chronic fluoxetine exposure upregulated activity protein and mrna levels of cytosolic phospholipase a2 in rat frontal cortex rao et al 2006 these studies along with the occurrence data suggest the potential role of these and related chemicals in the altered levels of pcho cho that were observed in the metabolome of zfl cells exposed to water from efp data from the present study also show that zfl cell lipid synthesis pathways were considerably affected by exposure to the wwtp effluent from the efp site figs 6 and 7 two pharmaceuticals that were detected above their minimum reporting levels only at the efp site bupropion and fluoxetine have been reported in a recent study to inhibit the activity of dhcr7 kim et al 2016 the detection of these dhcr7 inhibitors in efp effluent but not at other sites may potentially help explain the considerable accumulation of 7 dhc in cells exposed to the efp samples fig 6 however the apparent nonspecific chemical inhibition of dhcr7 does not preclude the role of other compounds in this response either from additional chemicals that were detected or those that were present but not included in the targeted analytical methods used for compound detection a number of other detected chemicals are known to affect certain enzyme activities in fatty acid biosynthetic pathways for example the pharmaceutical sitagliptin was reported to inhibit the production of malonyl coa and thus the synthesis of sfa sujishi et al 2015 three detected antidepressant drugs bupropion citalopram and fluoxetine have been shown to induce increased expression of stearoyl coa desaturase scd an enzyme that regulates the synthesis of ufa from sfa in human glial cells raeder et al 2006 conversely acetaminophen and carbamazepine were found to down regulate scd activity in human liver elferink et al 2011 and bronchial epithelial cells song et al 2011 respectively all of these compounds were detected as part of the complex mixture of chemicals present in the water collected at the efp site and none were detected above their minimum reporting levels at any of the other sites thus it seems likely that these and other bioactive chemicals both detected and undetected in combination could have resulted in the integrated effects observed for fatty acid metabolism in zfl cells 3 5 trends in metabolite changes and chemical compositions across various sites in addition to focusing specifically on the efp site we also explored the chemical data from the other sites in light of the pattern of zfl metabolome changes that were observed across these sites for example chemical analysis of the emz site sample collected 0 7 km downstream of efp resulted as expected in the detection of substantially fewer and less concentrated compounds as compared to the efp site susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 therefore that we observed no significant difference p 0 05 between efp and emz with respect to effect on both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic zfl metabolome figs 2 and 5 is somewhat surprising given the complexity of the chemical mixtures at these sites there could be multiple factors contributing to this discrepancy first an organic farm that cultivates vegetables and fruits was identified in close proximity to emz suggesting the possibility of an additional source of unmeasured bioactive constituents that might have contributed to the overall effect on the zfl metabolome second given the limited knowledge regarding the transformation products of contaminants in surface waters it is possible that a variety of unmeasured daughter products were present at emz that produced equivalent or greater toxicity to the zfl cells than the parent compounds furthermore the integrated effects of chemical mixtures on metabolome changes may not produce a linear dose response relationship particularly when mixing with river water indeed non linear dose response curves have been frequently observed in toxicological studies for example in numerous studies the toxicological effect s of a given compound appears to follow an inverted u shaped dose response curve in which increases in dose produce increased effect s up to a maximum followed by a decreasing response despite continuing to increase the dose calabrese and baldwin 2001 this type of response has been attributed to different types of effects occurring at different dose levels e g stimulatory at low dose and or inhibitory at high dose calabrese and baldwin 2001 clearly this relationship between the constituents found in complex environmental mixtures e g various types of contaminants and different dilution factors and their effects on the zfl cell metabolome warrant further investigation moreover given the disparity between efp and emz with regard to the number of compounds detected and the intensities of the metabolomic responses observed the importance of including untargeted biological assessments in conjunction with chemical monitoring efforts should not be underestimated our untargeted metabolomics assessment also suggested that an unidentified source of bioactive compounds that primarily affect lipid metabolism may exist in the stretch of river between dns and dwi for example as noted above the overall effects are greater at dwi than at dns for the lipophilic but not for the hydrophilic metabolome fig 5 given this unanticipated result we looked more closely for differences in compound detections at these sites there were slightly fewer constituents detected at dwi as compared to dns but one steroid hormone androstenedione which is often present in human and animal waste was considerably more abundant at dwi as compared to dns in spite of the fact that dwi is 5 4 km further downstream from the wwtp while there is no permitted wastewater discharge between dwi and dns a land use analysis revealed that this segment of river passes through a densely populated area that includes many residential homes businesses and a heavily trafficked highway thus some level of additional contamination from these and other sources may be contributing to the lipid response this may include for example stormwater runoff and leaking septic tanks only 60 of residents in the surrounding area are connected to sewer collection susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 4 conclusions the main goal of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of cell based metabolomics for tracking biological impacts of complex chemical mixtures as they move through aquatic systems from their initial release at a wwtp to a treated water intended for human consumption at a dwtp the analyses of both the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolomes revealed a gradient of response intensities generally diminishing with the distance of the sampling sites downstream from the wwtp and after drinking water treatment the ability to capture these trends even when some impacts are relatively small as in the case of treated drinking water vs other sites impacted by wwtp effluent provides a strong impetus to further develop this untargeted in vitro approach for environmental assessments in general and specifically for surface water reuse scenarios moreover these results underscore the importance of including such bioassay methods alongside extensive chemical monitoring for understanding potential sublethal contributions to exposure and risk the results of this study also emphasize the importance of including lipid analyses alongside more routine metabolomics assessments that are often exclusive of this important class of metabolites indeed as described above the lipophilic metabolome revealed an unexpectedly large response at the drinking water intake despite the level of wwtp contaminant dilution observed at this site finally biochemical pathway analysis of the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolite changes suggested candidate pathways energy amino acids and lipid metabolism and potential markers e g 7 dhc indicative of disrupted cholesterol metabolism for future investigations of other surface waters highly sensitive untargeted approaches such as in vitro metabolomics which can assess effects upon multiple biological pathways are increasing in importance as the global water crisis places additional focus on the complexity of ecological and human health effects that result from the discharge of natural and xenobiotic compounds into surface waters from wwtps however it is important to note that in vitro experiments in general do not fully mimic in vivo exposures for example cells used for in vitro exposures typically do not experience the types of intercellular interactions e g exchanges of nutrients signaling molecules growth factors observed in in vivo systems in addition xenobiotics from in vitro exposures are introduced directly into the growth medium while for in vivo experiments the exposure levels of xenobiotics are impacted by a number of factors including substrate uptake and transport looking forward the development and refinement of these tools with regard to linking these cellular level effects to whole organism and population level adverse responses is of considerable importance tools such as the adverse outcome pathway framework ankley et al 2010 which has been designed to support such efforts will be critical

19305,cell based metabolomics was used in a proof of concept fashion to investigate the biological effects of contaminants as they traveled from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharge to a drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake in a surface water usage cycle zebrafish liver zfl cells were exposed to water samples collected along a surface water flowpath where a wwtp was located 14 5 km upstream of a dwtp the sampling sites included 1 upstream of the wwtp 2 the wwtp effluent discharging point 3 a proximal location downstream of the wwtp outfall 4 a distal location downstream of the wwtp outfall 5 the drinking water intake and 6 the treated drinking water collected prior to discharge to the distribution system after a 48 h laboratory exposure the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites in zfl cell extracts were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms respectively multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct changes in metabolite profiles in response to wwtp effluent exposure these effects on the hydrophilic metabolome gradually diminished downstream of the wwtp becoming non significant at the drinking water intake comparable to upstream of the wwtp p 0 98 however effects on the lipophilic metabolome increased significantly as the river flowed from the distal location downstream of the wwtp to the drinking water intake p 0 001 suggesting a source of bioactive compounds in this watershed other than the wwtp zfl cells exposed to treated drinking water did not exhibit significant changes in either the hydrophilic p 0 15 or lipophilic metabolome p 0 83 compared to the upstream site suggesting that constituents in the wwtp effluent were efficiently removed by the drinking water treatment process impacts on zfl cells from the wwtp effluent included disrupted energy metabolism a global decrease in amino acids and altered lipid metabolism pathways overall this study demonstrated the utility of cell based metabolomics as an effective tool for assessing the biological effects of complex pollutant mixtures particularly when used as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring graphical abstract image 1 keywords metabolomics cell culture wastewater treatment plant effluent potable reuse water quality 1 introduction the past several decades have witnessed a rapidly increasing demand for water resources due to global economic development and an ever increasing population in many densely populated or arid regions the lack of sufficient potable water has led to the use of treated wastewater e g discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps for many non potable applications such as agricultural and landscape irrigations and groundwater recharge usda 2013 usepa 2004 unfortunately the discharge of treated wastewater into natural systems e g rivers and lakes has also inadvertently resulted in introduction of a complex mixture of organic contaminants to local aquatic ecosystems and importantly surface water derived drinking water supplies this use of treated wastewater after mixing with receiving waters has been referred to as de facto unplanned potable reuse by a national academy of engineering study nrc 2012 it was estimated recently that 50 of 2056 surface water intakes that serve 1210 drinking water treatment plants dwtps across the u s are potentially affected by upstream wwtp discharges rice and westerhoff 2015 wwtp effluent is one of the main sources of contaminants of emerging concern cecs to surface waters kolpin et al 2002 cecs comprise a wide variety of chemicals including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs disinfection by products dbps antibiotics and pesticides many cecs have been reported to cause adverse ecotoxicological effects at environmentally relevant concentrations raising concerns over their presence in receiving waters david et al 2018 kolpin et al 2002 adding to these concerns are the growing number of instances in which these same surface waters are used as drinking water sources i e de facto water reuse to date there have been a limited number of studies demonstrating the influence of wwtp effluent on the quality of drinking water sources boleda et al 2009 guo and krasner 2009 rodayan et al 2016 for example under extremely low streamflow conditions some dwtp intakes could contain almost 100 wwtp discharge that is complete de facto reuse rice et al 2013 and the concentrations of some ppcps at dwtp intakes have been comparable to those from upstream wwtp effluents guo and krasner 2009 this is potentially concerning given that other studies have shown incomplete 90 removal of many cecs during the drinking water treatment process including benzoylecgonine 2 ethylidene 1 5 dimethyl 3 3 diphenylpyrrolidine methadone cocaine methylenedioxyamphetamine ephedrine and several prescription opioids boleda et al 2009 rodayan et al 2016 the presence of these and many other cecs in streams receiving wwtp effluent coupled with the potential for their incomplete removal during the drinking water treatment process poses a signifcant and increasing challenge to chemical risk assessment indeed the vast number of chemicals in wastewater has far exceeded our analytical capability based on individual targeted analysis nrc 2007 moreover there remains a dearth of information regarding the toxic modes of action moas of most targeted chemicals this implies an even greater level of uncertainty when unidentified contaminants are considered judson et al 2009 the limited understanding of how individual chemical toxicities are modified when chemicals occur in very complex mixtures at environmental conditions further complicates the risk assessment process schwarzenbach et al 2006 to address these and other limitations of the conventional targeted chemical monitoring approach a variety of biological effects based tools have emerged and have increasingly been used in water quality assessment escher and leusch 2012 these tools include bioassays that target specific biological activities such as estrogenic or androgenic receptor binding escher and leusch 2012 more recently omics tools that analyze gene transcripts proteins and or endogenous metabolites have gained popularity for moa assessments of individual chemicals as well as complex environmental mixtures davis et al 2017 skelton et al 2014 xia et al 2017 these effects based tools are particularly attractive as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring because they are both open ended i e untargeted and they provide insights into the biological impacts of complex mixtures even when the individual contaminants cannot be uniquely identified or quantified due to advantages that have been discussed elsewhere bundy et al 2009 lankadurai et al 2013 metabolomics has been shown to be a particularly useful omics approach for evaluating comprehensive biological responses to various environmental stressors for example this approach has been extensively employed to investigate the moas of various xenobiotics including nanoparticles ratnasekhar et al 2015 ppcps gomez canela et al 2016 and edcs davis et al 2017 through laboratory based animal e g rodents fish and invertebrates exposures in addition field based metabolomics assessments using on site exposure of fish have been used successfully to investigate the biological effect of complex contaminant mixtures discharging from both point e g wwtp effluent and non point sources davis et al 2013 skelton et al 2014 however metabolomics studies that employ live animals are labor and resource intensive and typically require lethal sampling to collect the relevant tissues and or biofluids in an effort to circumvent these drawbacks we previously developed a cell culture based metabolomics method and applied it to investigate the effect s of exposure to 17α ethynylestradiol on zebrafish danio rerio liver zfl cells teng et al 2013 our findings showed that the cellular responses agreed with those metabolite changes observed in vivo teng et al 2013 this suggested that cell based metabolomics approaches have the potential of providing valuable ecotoxicological information in a particularly high throughput and cost effective manner in the current study the zfl cell based metabolomics approach was extended to investigate the biological effect s of a wwtp effluent discharged into a stream and further downstream to a dwtp in a de facto potable reuse cycle previously zebrafish has been identified as a model vertebrate for investigating chemical toxicity both in vivo and in vitro and proven highly relevant for both human and ecological health dai et al 2014 the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cell based metabolomics for tracking the biological effects of contaminants as they travel from the wwtp to the corresponding downstream dwtp as well as the final drinking water product a second goal was to test the applicability and efficacy of cell based metabolomics for ecological assessments of complex environmental mixtures and to identify relationships between metabolomics endpoints and conventional contaminant detections 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations in april 2015 water samples were taken from a stretch of a river in the northeastern usa where a wwtp is located 14 5 km upstream of the intake of a dwtp the relative locations of all six sampling sites are shown in fig 1 grab samples were collected upstream ups of the wwtp at the effluent pipe efp of the wwtp a proximal location downstream of the wwtp outfall emz where the effluent is well mixed with the river as demonstrated by conductivity a distal location downstream of the wwtp outfall dns at the drinking water intake dwi and from treated drinking water tdw collected from the clear well just prior to discharge to the distribution system the ups site was located 1 2 km upstream of efp while emz dns and dwi were 0 7 9 1 and 14 5 km respectively downstream from efp the travel times of water from ups to efp emz dns dwi and tdw including residence times in the dwtp were estimated to be 0 8 1 3 7 2 10 9 and 18 9 h respectively no precipitation was reported during the period of sampling susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 the wwtp effluent flow 1 7 ft3 s was less than 1 of the flow of river water 1179 ft3 s average of measurements at three different locations along this segment of river during sample collection indicating a low magnitude of de facto potable reuse in the study area rice and westerhoff 2015 all samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles placed immediately on ice shipped overnight and stored at 20 c additional descriptions of the wwtp and dwtp are provided in supporting information 2 2 culturing of zfl cells and exposure experimental design zfl cells crl 2643 atcc manassas va were cultivated at 28 c in a humidified atmosphere as monolayer cultures in medium see the supporting information for medium composition prepared according to atcc s instructions www atcc org to prepare zfl cells for exposure four t75 flasks of cells were harvested after they reached 100 confluence cells were combined and evenly distributed to 49 culture dishes there were seven biological replicates for each of six sampling locations and the laboratory control for precultivation at 28 c for 48 h for cell exposure experiments the cell culture medium was displaced with the prepared mixed exposure medium made from the field collected grab samples specifically a medium based on the composition as described in the supporting information but at a four fold higher concentration was prepared this concentrated medium was mixed in a ratio of 1 3 with a filtered 0 1 μm water sample from each field site or with purified water ultrapure type 1 18 2 mω cm 0 1 μm filtered aqua solutions jasper ga usa that served as the laboratory control con thus the final concentrations of environmental samples in the exposure medium were 75 of the concentrations in the initial field collected water samples cells were then incubated at 28 c for 48 h before quenching cytotoxicity of water samples was tested based on a previously published protocol feoktistova et al 2016 no significant p 0 05 cytotoxic effects were observed for cells exposed to environmental samples vs con see the supporting information for details of the assay 2 3 extraction and analysis of intracellular metabolites a direct quenching method that was developed in our laboratory was applied to quench zfl cells after the 48 h exposure teng et al 2009 the intracellular metabolites were further extracted using a dual phase method that was published previously teng et al 2013 a bi phasic mixture was generated at the end of extraction and further separated into two fractions that contained mainly hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites respectively both fractions of cell extracts were dried using a vacuum concentrator thermo electron waltham ma usa after that the hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions of cell extracts from individual biological replicates were analyzed with an inova 600 mhz nmr spectrometer agilent santa clara ca usa and a gas chromatograph connected to a single quadrupole mass spectrometer in full scan mode thermo trace 1310 and isq waltham ma usa respectively additional descriptions of metabolite extraction and nmr and gc ms data acquisitions are provided in the supporting information 2 4 nmr data processing the nmr spectra were processed with 0 3 hz apodization after removing the residual solvent the spectra were binned at a width of 0 005 ppm within the range of 0 50 10 00 ppm the binned data were imported into microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa usa and normalized to unit total integrated intensity for subsequent analysis 2 5 gc ms data processing the metalign software package wageningen university netherlands was used to perform baseline correction background and noise reduction peak smoothing and selection and retention time alignment with gc ms chromatograms lommen and kools 2012 peaks with signal to noise s n ratios less than three were rejected ion groups were assembled into metabolites using the msclust software package wageningen university netherlands and unique ions for each metabolite were used for relative quantification tikunov et al 2012 artifact peaks arising from the derivatization reagent column bleed as well as peaks observed in method blanks were excluded only metabolites consistently detected in at least 80 of samples in at least one of the six sites or con were retained metabolites with relative standard deviations rsd of greater than 30 in the quality control samples were excluded from the final dataset putative annotation of metabolites was conducted by comparing the retention index δ of 10 and ei mass spectrum similarity 70 to those recorded in the nist05 wiley 7 and golm metabolome database mass spectral libraries or those obtained from the standards injection following these steps the final dataset contained a total of 107 unique metabolites 32 of which were annotated 5 at level i and 27 at level ii as defined by the metabolomics standard initiative msi www metabolomics msi org normalized abundance relative to a constant sum of all detected metabolites was performed for each sample prior to statistical analyses 2 6 statistical analysis multivariate analyses with nmr and gc ms data were conducted with simca version 14 1 umetrics umea sweden the nmr data were mean centered and pareto scaled while the gc ms data were mean centered and scaled to unit variance principal component analysis pca models were built with all data points and outliers were defined as those points that fell out of the 95 confidence interval of a hotellings t2 test anova with tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test was performed for multiple group comparison of pca scores on the first and second components for analysis of the nmr and gc ms data a student s t test was performed to compare the normalized abundance of individual metabolites between a given site and the control using the results of this analysis we generated t test filtered difference spectra by subtracting averaged relative abundances of the control from those of a given site in addition we calculated the fold change of lipophilic metabolites that exhibited significant difference between a sampling site and the control comparisons were also carried out with a selection of lipophilic metabolites to investigate the abundance change across all sites by applying anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test overall a significance level of 0 05 was set for all statistical tests in this study more details on generating these difference spectra including the strategies for controlling false positives with multiple t tests and across site comparisons are provided in supporting information a bioactivity network was built based on significantly changed p 0 05 and annotated metabolites using the open source software cytoscape www cytoscape org all data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the main text and supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of metabolite profiles of zfl cells following exposure to water from each site pca score plots displayed an overall alteration of metabolite profiles of zfl cells following exposure to field water samples relative to controls fig 2 distinct separations across several of the sampling sites was achieved in the first component of pca score plots for both hydrophilic fig 2a and lipophilic fig 2b sample extracts anova with post hoc tukey s hsd analysis was applied to evaluate the significance of metabolite profile differences between individual sites using the pca scores of the first two components table s1 water collected from the ups site shows discernible differences in metabolome profiles of zfl cells relative to con in both score plots pc1 p 0 039 in fig 2a p 0 005 in fig 2b this is perhaps not surprising since there are several known potential sources of contamination i e wwtps located upstream of ups in addition as with all field collected waters this sample contained natural constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom that were absent in con it is reasonable to suspect that these natural constituents were also contributing to the cellular metabolic changes observed at ups for example dom in natural waters was shown to have a significant effect on the metabolic energy status of daphnia pulex pulicaria taylor et al 2016 however it is notable that in other similar field studies we have seen no separation in pc1 for score plots similarly generated by nmr analysis of the polar fraction of a relatively pristine field water vs a similarly prepared lab control quincy teng personal communication july 25th 2018 this suggests that the known potential sources of contamination located upstream from the current study sites are indeed contributing to the metabolite marker profiles at ups the water sample collected at efp reflected the most distinct change in metabolome profile among all sites based on the extent of its separation from con along pc1 in both hydrophilic and lipophilic score plots this effect decreased but not significantly at emz which was proximal below the outfall pc1 p 0 77 in fig 2a p 0 57 in fig 2b emz vs efp and where dilution of effluent with river water had taken place as water flowed further downstream the zfl cells exhibited different patterns of change in the hydrophilic metabolome as compared to the lipophilic metabolome specifically the effects of dns and dwi observed in the hydrophilic extracts significantly decreased relative to the effect of emz fig 2a pc1 p 0 007 for dns vs emz and p 0 007 for dwi vs emz in fact the pc1 score values for dns and dwi were coincident with those of ups for the score plot generated from the hydrophilic metabolome fig 2a conversely the effects observed in the dns and dwi lipophilic extracts were not significantly different from that of emz fig 2b pc1 p 0 799 for dns vs emz and p 1 for dwi vs emz and were significantly greater than that of ups pc1 p 0 001 for dns vs ups and p 0 001 for dwi vs ups finally the effect of tdw on the zfl metabolome was found to be generally comparable to that of ups based on pc1 score values in both pca plots however a statistically significant difference was observed when comparing pc1 scores of tdw and con from the score plot for the lipophilic metabolome fig 2a p 0 001 but not in the plot for the hydrophilic metabolome fig 2b p 0 78 tdw and con score values were significantly different along pc2 for the hydrophilic metabolome p 0 04 but not for the lipophilic metabolome p 0 691 it seems reasonable although untested that this difference in metabolite profiles between con and tdw could be caused by the ubiquitous occurrence of dbps in treated drinking water richardson and ternes 2014 for example similar findings were also reported in an earlier study showing higher baseline toxicity and neurotoxicity in treated drinking water compared with purified water when testing with a variety of bioanalytical tools macova et al 2011 to further investigate the site specific effects on both the zfl hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolomes we focused only on those metabolites that exhibited a statistically significant change in normalized abundance versus that of the controls p 0 05 the t test filtered difference spectra were generated for the hydrophilic extracts fig 3 and s1 as described in the materials and methods section consistent with the pca score plot fig 2a the efp and emz sites which are directly or indirectly affected by wwtp effluent exhibited a similar pattern of changes in the difference spectra with respect to the identity of changed hydrophilic metabolites and the magnitude of those changes the effects at other field sites were less than those observed at efp and emz based on the number and magnitude of altered metabolite peaks for the lipophilic extracts analyzed with gc ms a fold change plot was made for the exposure result for each site versus control see fig 4 for annotated metabolites fig s2 for a version displaying all metabolites there are 44 63 32 and 53 metabolites out of a total of 107 that exhibited significant changes in efp emz dns and dwi respectively versus con p 0 05 in agreement with the pca score plot these four sites exhibit similar patterns of metabolite changes fig s2 however several metabolites exhibited considerably greater increases in normalized abundance for the efp site than any metabolites at any of the other sites for the two least impacted sites ups and tdw only 13 and 19 metabolites respectively are found to change significantly in normalized abundance versus con p 0 05 in a further step we summed the absolute values of intensity differences of all peaks from the t test filtered difference spectra for zfl hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts and compared their magnitudes as a proxy for total impact from the exposure for each site fig 5 for both hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts efp was found to be the most affected site in agreement with the pca score plots fig 2 the level of dilution at the emz site did not result in a statistically significant attenuation p 0 08 for hydrophilic extracts and p 0 26 for lipophilic extracts still in general the effect of effluent from the wwtp gradually decreased along the direction of water flow particularly in the case of the hydrophilic extract fig 5a however we noted a discrepancy between the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolome at dwi where the integrated impact on hydrophilic metabolites was at the same level as that of ups fig 5a while the intensity change of the lipophilic metabolome for dwi was even greater than that observed at dns fig 5b note that as discussed above these trends were also observable in the score plots of fig 2 inconsistent effects on biological responses when looking at both the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites are not uncommon having also been reported for an in vivo exposure of fathead minnows pimephales promelas fhm that were caged at various locations near a wwtp skelton et al 2014 however it serves to reiterate the importance of capturing the greatest extent of the intracellular metabolome as possible as different classes of metabolites e g lipids amino acids carbohydrates can provide both complementary and disparate types of information an examination of the greater impact on the lipophilic metabolome of the zfl cells exposed to water from the dwi site suggests an additional source of environmental stressor s in the stretch of the river between dns and dwi that mainly affects lipid metabolism regardless of the source of the stressor s it appears that they are effectively eliminated during drinking water treatment based on a comparison of the summed integrated differences of tdw and dwi fig 5b indeed the data in fig 5 suggest that in this system the response in the zfl cells from the wwtp effluent is well controlled downstream through a combination of river dilution natural attenuation and existing drinking water treatment technologies 3 2 metabolic pathway perturbations observed in the hydrophilic zfl metabolome the combined metabolome changes as depicted in fig 2 through 5 suggest that wwtp effluent was the primary cause of the responses that we measured in this portion of the river system hence further analyses focused on the perturbed metabolic pathways associated with exposure to the effluent using these pathways a bioactivity network was built using a majority of the annotated metabolites fig 6 the complete list of affected metabolites is presented in tables s2 and s3 analysis of the bioactivity network revealed that several metabolites associated with energy metabolism in zfl were found to change substantially following exposure to the wwtp effluent efp for example the key entry and exit metabolites for the glycolysis pathway glucose and pyruvate respectively were found to decrease in the zfl metabolome following exposure this suggested a greater energetic demand by zfl cells when exposed to the complex mixtures in the effluent this hypothesis was further bolstered by findings in the nmr difference spectra of depleted cellular energy molecules axps atp adp amp see fig s1 in supporting information in keeping with increased cellular energy consumption udp glucose was also found to decrease following exposure to the efp site water samples udp glucose is the major form of glucose utilized in the synthesis of polysaccharides e g glycogen in biological cells a previous study showed that glucose starvation could result in udp glucose deficiency and inactivation of glycogen synthase higuita et al 2004 thus it appears that not only the short term energy balance was affected e g decreased glucose and nucleotides but potentially so were cellular reserves e g glycogen unfortunately due to the low levels of metabolites characteristic of zfl cells we were unable to evaluate effects on glycogen regardless the concomitant decreases in energetic metabolites in the hydrophilic metabolome suggests that glycogen effects may be observed in vivo oxidative degradation i e the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle was also affected by wwtp effluent exposure specifically the abundances of citrate and succinate were found decreased in the efp exposed cells compared to con conversely lactate the primary by product of fermentation i e homolactic fermentation was found to increase in cells that were exposed to water samples collected at the wwtp effluent discharging point a number of amino acids in zfl cells were decreased following wastewater exposure fig 6 specifically reductions in valine leucine isoleucine lysine threonine glutamine arginine tryptophan and phenylalanine were observed given the decreases measured in energetic metabolites glucose pyruvate etc the global decrease in amino acids is likely due in part to increased consumption by glycolysis and the tca cycle i e anaplerosis to sustain energy production exceptions to this apparent global decrease are the increases observed for glutamate and tyrosine in fact one of the most prominent metabolite changes following exposure to wwtp effluent is the increase of glutamate fig 3 which appeared to coincide with decreases in glutamine and glutathione these findings suggest disturbance of the glutamate metabolism pathway which could have multiple implications for cell viability and function newsholme et al 2003 as the hub of this pathway glutamate undergoes transformation to numerous other metabolites in order to meet the changing demands of the cell for example glutamate can influence the tca cycle through deamination to α ketoglutarate provide a readily available sink for excess nitrogen via its conversion to glutamine and support amino acid homeostasis furthermore as a component of the tripeptide glutathione glutamate is essential for defense against oxidative stressors e g free radicals peroxides and heavy metals newsholme et al 2003 the reduction in glutathione suggests the presence of components of the wwtp effluent mixture capable of inducing oxidative stress however exactly how this decline relates to the observed increase in glutamate is uncertain beyond energetic effects we also observed a large increase in choline cho and phosphocholine pcho in zfl cells from the efp site fig 3 cho and pcho are major components in the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids that determine the cell membrane fluidity and govern overall cell functions li and vance 2008 in biological cells pcho cho can either be acquired from the extracellular environment or produced de novo via the action of phospholipase an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine an important component of membrane phospholipids into fatty acids and other substances including cho and pcho li and vance 2008 the products from phospholipase action play critical roles in many physiological processes including the generation of signaling lipids as well as regulation of energy metabolism li and vance 2008 considering the close relationship between pcho cho levels and lipid homeostasis in biological cells such a large increase of pcho cho suggests considerable disturbance of lipid metabolism by the effluent exposure which we indeed observed in the lipophilic zfl metabolome figs 2b 4 and 5b 3 3 metabolic pathway perturbations observed in the lipophilic zfl metabolome guided in part by the large change of pcho cho levels in the hydrophilic zfl metabolome fig 3 we further analyzed the gc ms data to assess which lipid metabolism pathways were affected by exposing zfl cells to the wwtp effluent because 19 of the 21 annotated lipophilic metabolites fig 4 were classified as intermediates or end products in either cholesterol or fatty acid synthesis we focused our attention on the effects of exposure from the efp site water relative to con on these pathways specifically we first assessed the variation in abundances of cholesterol and its biosynthetic intermediates in the context of a bioactivity network cholesterol plays an essential role in vertebrate biochemistry and physiology maintaining the structural integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane and serving as the precursor for biosynthesis of steroid hormones vitamin d and bile acids van der wulp et al 2013 hence regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is of paramount importance in the current study we found that 14 demethyllanosterol significantly decreased p 0 01 while the levels of three other intermediate metabolites desmosterol lathosterol and 7 dehydrocholesterol 7 dhc were significantly elevated upon exposure to efp fig 6 p 0 001 for desmosterol p 0 002 for lathosterol and p 0 001 for 7 dhc it should be noted that the normalized abundance of 7 dhc was 102 times that of the con see fig 4 log2 fold change 6 7 however its downstream reaction product cholesterol was not significantly changed p 0 22 this pattern of metabolite changes has recently been reported with neuro2a cells that were exposed to over 30 different pharmacologically active compounds that were associated with inhibited conversion of 7 dhc to cholesterol via the enzyme 7 dhc reductase dhcr7 kim et al 2016 expression changes both increases and decreases in the transcript and or protein of dhcr7 has frequently been reported in aquatic species exposed to a range of environmental contaminants including cu santos et al 2010 linuron webster et al 2015 and 17α ethynylestradiol tompsett et al 2013 thus the marked change in 7 dhc observed here is not without some precedent and may represent a candidate marker for exposure to contaminated surface waters in regard to fatty acid metabolism we observed significant decreases in the normalized abundances of two saturated fatty acids sfa hexadecanoic acid c16 0 p 0 001 and octadecanoic acid c18 0 p 0 001 in efp exposed zfl cells relative to control fig 7 b for the monounsaturated fatty acids mufa it was found that hexadecenoic acid c16 1 abundance increased significantly p 0 02 after efp exposure fig 7c another commonly detected mufa octadecenoic acid c18 1 was also found to increase in normalized abundance upon efp exposure however this increase did not meet the threshold for statistical significance p 0 12 fig 7c as for the polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa the final dataset for the lipophilic metabolome contained only one metabolite octadecadienoic acid c18 2 and there was no significant difference p 0 81 in its normalized abundance between efp and con interestingly the sum of abundances of all detected fatty acids did not show a significant difference between efp and con p 0 65 this suggests that the combined pool of fatty acids in the zfl cells was at a steady state following efp exposure however looking more closely at the selectivity of responses with regard to extent of saturation suggests that exposure to the undiluted wastewater effluent from efp promoted the biotransformation of sfa to mufa mufa as opposed to sfa have been reported to have a protective effect on oxidative stress quiles et al 2006 and cellular inflammation liu et al 2011 previously a number of studies have reported elevated mufa levels across multiple species fish rodent and invertebrate that were exposed to environmental contaminants including 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzofuran zhang et al 2015 tributyltin janer et al 2007 and perfluorinated compounds wagbo et al 2012 considering the fact that wwtp effluent contains a complex mixture of numerous natural and xenobiotic compounds that may exert oxidative stress and or an inflammatory effect on zfl cells it is plausible that the elevated mufa level relative to sfa reflects the physiological status of zfl cells in combating both types of environmental stress in response to exposure to wwtp effluent 3 4 relating metabolite changes with chemicals detected at the wwtp site efp data from this study clearly show that the zfl cell metabolome was impacted to the greatest extent by direct exposure to wwtp effluent i e the efp site as discussed above many of the metabolite changes that were measured provide new or confirmatory knowledge regarding in vitro responses and demonstrate the value of cell based metabolomics for screening environmental surface waters note that water samples collected concurrently at the same study sites were analyzed for over 200 chemical pollutants that cover a wide variety of classes including antibiotics disinfection byproducts endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceutical compounds and inorganic compounds results will be published separately susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 using the targeted chemical analysis results we were able to establish potential links between a selection of chemicals and certain perturbed metabolic pathways that were observed in zfl cells following exposure to effluent from the efp site as discussed earlier one of the most distinct metabolite changes in efp exposed cells as opposed to other sites was the increase in the pcho cho level fig 3 which may indicate promoted phospholipase activity interestingly some of the pharmaceuticals detected above their minimum reporting levels only at the efp site including acetaminophen and fluoxetine have been reported to upregulate the activity of phospholipase for example acetaminophen was found to increase the expression of mrna for multiple members of the phospholipase family in mouse liver coen et al 2003 and chronic fluoxetine exposure upregulated activity protein and mrna levels of cytosolic phospholipase a2 in rat frontal cortex rao et al 2006 these studies along with the occurrence data suggest the potential role of these and related chemicals in the altered levels of pcho cho that were observed in the metabolome of zfl cells exposed to water from efp data from the present study also show that zfl cell lipid synthesis pathways were considerably affected by exposure to the wwtp effluent from the efp site figs 6 and 7 two pharmaceuticals that were detected above their minimum reporting levels only at the efp site bupropion and fluoxetine have been reported in a recent study to inhibit the activity of dhcr7 kim et al 2016 the detection of these dhcr7 inhibitors in efp effluent but not at other sites may potentially help explain the considerable accumulation of 7 dhc in cells exposed to the efp samples fig 6 however the apparent nonspecific chemical inhibition of dhcr7 does not preclude the role of other compounds in this response either from additional chemicals that were detected or those that were present but not included in the targeted analytical methods used for compound detection a number of other detected chemicals are known to affect certain enzyme activities in fatty acid biosynthetic pathways for example the pharmaceutical sitagliptin was reported to inhibit the production of malonyl coa and thus the synthesis of sfa sujishi et al 2015 three detected antidepressant drugs bupropion citalopram and fluoxetine have been shown to induce increased expression of stearoyl coa desaturase scd an enzyme that regulates the synthesis of ufa from sfa in human glial cells raeder et al 2006 conversely acetaminophen and carbamazepine were found to down regulate scd activity in human liver elferink et al 2011 and bronchial epithelial cells song et al 2011 respectively all of these compounds were detected as part of the complex mixture of chemicals present in the water collected at the efp site and none were detected above their minimum reporting levels at any of the other sites thus it seems likely that these and other bioactive chemicals both detected and undetected in combination could have resulted in the integrated effects observed for fatty acid metabolism in zfl cells 3 5 trends in metabolite changes and chemical compositions across various sites in addition to focusing specifically on the efp site we also explored the chemical data from the other sites in light of the pattern of zfl metabolome changes that were observed across these sites for example chemical analysis of the emz site sample collected 0 7 km downstream of efp resulted as expected in the detection of substantially fewer and less concentrated compounds as compared to the efp site susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 therefore that we observed no significant difference p 0 05 between efp and emz with respect to effect on both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic zfl metabolome figs 2 and 5 is somewhat surprising given the complexity of the chemical mixtures at these sites there could be multiple factors contributing to this discrepancy first an organic farm that cultivates vegetables and fruits was identified in close proximity to emz suggesting the possibility of an additional source of unmeasured bioactive constituents that might have contributed to the overall effect on the zfl metabolome second given the limited knowledge regarding the transformation products of contaminants in surface waters it is possible that a variety of unmeasured daughter products were present at emz that produced equivalent or greater toxicity to the zfl cells than the parent compounds furthermore the integrated effects of chemical mixtures on metabolome changes may not produce a linear dose response relationship particularly when mixing with river water indeed non linear dose response curves have been frequently observed in toxicological studies for example in numerous studies the toxicological effect s of a given compound appears to follow an inverted u shaped dose response curve in which increases in dose produce increased effect s up to a maximum followed by a decreasing response despite continuing to increase the dose calabrese and baldwin 2001 this type of response has been attributed to different types of effects occurring at different dose levels e g stimulatory at low dose and or inhibitory at high dose calabrese and baldwin 2001 clearly this relationship between the constituents found in complex environmental mixtures e g various types of contaminants and different dilution factors and their effects on the zfl cell metabolome warrant further investigation moreover given the disparity between efp and emz with regard to the number of compounds detected and the intensities of the metabolomic responses observed the importance of including untargeted biological assessments in conjunction with chemical monitoring efforts should not be underestimated our untargeted metabolomics assessment also suggested that an unidentified source of bioactive compounds that primarily affect lipid metabolism may exist in the stretch of river between dns and dwi for example as noted above the overall effects are greater at dwi than at dns for the lipophilic but not for the hydrophilic metabolome fig 5 given this unanticipated result we looked more closely for differences in compound detections at these sites there were slightly fewer constituents detected at dwi as compared to dns but one steroid hormone androstenedione which is often present in human and animal waste was considerably more abundant at dwi as compared to dns in spite of the fact that dwi is 5 4 km further downstream from the wwtp while there is no permitted wastewater discharge between dwi and dns a land use analysis revealed that this segment of river passes through a densely populated area that includes many residential homes businesses and a heavily trafficked highway thus some level of additional contamination from these and other sources may be contributing to the lipid response this may include for example stormwater runoff and leaking septic tanks only 60 of residents in the surrounding area are connected to sewer collection susan glassmeyer personal communication october 24th 2017 4 conclusions the main goal of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of cell based metabolomics for tracking biological impacts of complex chemical mixtures as they move through aquatic systems from their initial release at a wwtp to a treated water intended for human consumption at a dwtp the analyses of both the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolomes revealed a gradient of response intensities generally diminishing with the distance of the sampling sites downstream from the wwtp and after drinking water treatment the ability to capture these trends even when some impacts are relatively small as in the case of treated drinking water vs other sites impacted by wwtp effluent provides a strong impetus to further develop this untargeted in vitro approach for environmental assessments in general and specifically for surface water reuse scenarios moreover these results underscore the importance of including such bioassay methods alongside extensive chemical monitoring for understanding potential sublethal contributions to exposure and risk the results of this study also emphasize the importance of including lipid analyses alongside more routine metabolomics assessments that are often exclusive of this important class of metabolites indeed as described above the lipophilic metabolome revealed an unexpectedly large response at the drinking water intake despite the level of wwtp contaminant dilution observed at this site finally biochemical pathway analysis of the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolite changes suggested candidate pathways energy amino acids and lipid metabolism and potential markers e g 7 dhc indicative of disrupted cholesterol metabolism for future investigations of other surface waters highly sensitive untargeted approaches such as in vitro metabolomics which can assess effects upon multiple biological pathways are increasing in importance as the global water crisis places additional focus on the complexity of ecological and human health effects that result from the discharge of natural and xenobiotic compounds into surface waters from wwtps however it is important to note that in vitro experiments in general do not fully mimic in vivo exposures for example cells used for in vitro exposures typically do not experience the types of intercellular interactions e g exchanges of nutrients signaling molecules growth factors observed in in vivo systems in addition xenobiotics from in vitro exposures are introduced directly into the growth medium while for in vivo experiments the exposure levels of xenobiotics are impacted by a number of factors including substrate uptake and transport looking forward the development and refinement of these tools with regard to linking these cellular level effects to whole organism and population level adverse responses is of considerable importance tools such as the adverse outcome pathway framework ankley et al 2010 which has been designed to support such efforts will be critical

that oxidation products of fqs by pms retained negligible antibacterial potency in comparison to parent fqs kinetic modeling using the rate constants estimated from pure water well predicted the oxidation kinetics of low levels of cf and ef by pms in surface water the degradation efficiency of fqs by pms in surface water was slightly lower than that by ozone comparable to that by ferrate and much higher than that by permanganate these results suggest that pms is a promising oxidant for the treatment of fqs in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate fluoroquinolone

been received little attention in previous studies pms with a standard redox potential e h 0 of 1 82 v may act as a mild oxidant betterton and hoffmann 1990 for example wang et al 2014 reported that pms was capable of directly oxidizing arsenite to arsenate with a relatively high rate yang et al 2018 showed that pms without activation could appreciably oxidize the commonly used singlet oxygen 1o2

product ion spectra i e ida antibacterial activity analysis escherichia coli e coli had been widely used as model bacteria to assess the antibacterial activity of fqs in this study the effect of pms

kinetics fig 2 a showed the time course profiles of the degradation of fqs 5 μm by pms 0 42 mm at ph 8 fqs were stable in absence of pms while appreciable degradation of fqs was achieved in the presence of pms quenching studies were conducted to verify whether reactive radicals i e so4 and oh were involved in the degradation of fqs by pms it was found that methanol and tert butanol in excess had negligible influence on the degradation of cf suggesting that neither so4 nor oh was participated in the degradation of fqs by pms fig s1 for example it is well known that 1o2 can be generated from the self decomposition of pms in aqueous solutions edwards et al 1979 evans and upton 1985 zhou et al 2015 the involvement of 1o2 was also excluded by quenching studies where nan3 an efficient quencher for 1o2 had negligible effect on the degradation of cf see fig s1 for example this was consistent with the finding obtained by yang et al 2018 that 1o2 only played a minor role in the oxidation of ffa by pms because the generation rate of 1o2 from self decomposition of pms was very slow and the quenching effect of 1o2 by water was very strong haag et al 1984 yang et al 2018 these results suggested that pms itself rather than its activation products i e so4 oh and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of fqs the loss of cf and ef in the presence of excess pms all exhibited pseudo first order kinetics over the ph range of 5 10 insert in fig 2a for example indicating that the reactions were first order with respect to these two fqs the measured pseudo first order rates k obs increased linearly with the increase of pms concentration fig 2b for example demonstrating that the reactions were also first order with respect to pms therefore the apparent second order rate constant k app could be determined by eq 1 1 d fq tot d t k app pms tot fq tot where pms tot and fq tot represent the total concentrations of pms hso5 and so5 2 and fq species respectively as shown in fig 3 the k app values of cf and ef exhibited strong ph dependency for instance k app cf substantially increased above ph 5 with a maximum occurring near ph 9 and then decreased as ph further increased these ph dependent rate profiles might be ascribed to a combined effect of pms speciation eq 2 goodman and robson 1963 and fqs speciation fig 1b and c where deprotonation of fqs contributed to the increase in reaction rates while deprotonation of pms ion hso5 resulted in the decrease of reaction rates 2 hso 5 so 5 2 h pka 9 3 3 2 kinetic modeling of ph dependency of rate constants cf and ef were amphoteric compounds exhibiting the acid base speciation fig 1b and c according to previous studies it was difficult to make an accurate micro speciation modeling since the reported values of micro speciation constants i e k 11 and k 21 differed distinctly for a given fq hernàndez borrell and montero 1997 ross and riley 1992 alternatively the speciation of fqs was modeled according to macro speciation patterns the combination of zwitterion and neutral species was considered as a single effective species cf and ef could be considered as diprotic acids for their piperazinyl n4 amine and carboxylate group and their pka values were exhibited in fig 1b and c luis vázquez et al 2001 zhang and huang 2005 the macroscopic k a1 is corresponding to the piperazinyl n4 amine and the macroscopic k a2 is corresponding to the carboxylate group the ph dependency of k app for each fq could be quantitatively modeled by eq 3 3 k app pms tot fq tot i 1 2 j 1 2 3 k ij α i pms tot β j fq tot where αi and βj represent the respective species distribution coefficients for pms and target fq i and j represent pms species i e hso5 or so5 2 and fq species i e cationic fq zwitterion neutral fq or anionic fq respectively and k ij represents the species specific second order rate constant for the reaction between pms species i with fq species j the reactions of pms with fq were neglected in the model calculations because k app values decreased with decreasing ph and became very low at ph 5 this result suggested that pms was unreactive toward cationic fqs since so5 2 always exhibited lower oxidizing capacity than hso5 chen et al 2018 lente et al 2009 zhou et al 2017 2018 the reactions of so5 2 with fq and fq were preliminarily neglected in the model calculation for simplification consequently the following reactions eqs 4 and 5 were initially proposed as main reactions between pms and fqs to explain the ph dependency of the reaction rates 4 hso 5 fq k 12 products 5 hso 5 fq k 13 products the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 6 k app k 12 α 1 β 2 k 13 α 1 β 3 the species specific second order rate constants k ij were calculated according to nonlinear least squares regressions of experimental k app values as can be seen the fit between experimental data and model ones was satisfactory fig 3 validating that the overall reactions were dominated by reactions 4 5 the calculated k ij values were summarized in table 1 specific second order rate constants of hso5 with zwitterion neutral fq species k 12 were 1 57 m 1s 1 for cf and 6 88 m 1s 1 for ef respectively which were much lower than those with fq 30 00 and 43 40 m 1s 1 respectively this result suggested that fq was more susceptible to pms oxidation the contribution of species specific reactions to the overall k app was also depicted in fig 3 for cf the reaction of hso5 with zwitterion neutral cf k 1 2 α1 β2 dominated at ph 7 5 and the reaction of hso5 with cf k 1 3 α1 β3 was predominant at ph 7 5 similar result was also observed in the case of ef 3 3 comparison of pms with common oxidants a comparison of the ph dependent k app for the reactions of selective oxidants i e free chlorine hocl chlorine dioxide clo2 o3 mn vii fe vi and pms with cf and ef was made in fig 4 a and b respectively dodd et al 2005 2006 hu et al 2010 lee et al 2009 wang et al 2010 for cf the reaction rates of hocl 2 7 104 1 4 106 m 1s 1 clo2 0 34 183 m 1s 1 o3 9 5 102 8 6 105 m 1s 1 and fe vi 6 60 416 m 1s 1 were much higher than those of pms 0 10 13 05 m 1s 1 in the ph range of 5 10 while pms exhibited higher reactivity than mn vii 0 50 1 18 m 1s 1 when ph 6 at near neutral ph the second order rate constants of pms with ef were comparable with those of fe vi but lower than hocl clo2 and o3 3 4 reactive sites the reactions of pms with flu and pp i e structurally related fluoroquinolone and piperazine portions were examined as shown in fig s2 negligible flu was degraded by pms while pp could be rapidly degraded by pms at ph 8 these results suggested that quinolone moiety was refractory to pms oxidation and the piperazine moiety containing aromatic amine and secondary or tertiary aliphatic amine was the reactive site the piperazine ring was also identified as the reactive site of fqs in the case of other oxidants e g hocl clo2 o3 mn vii fe vi and mno2 dodd et al 2005 2006 wang et al 2010 hu et al 2011 lee et al 2009 zhang and huang 2005 feng et al 2016 for example feng et al 2016 found that ef was rapidly degraded by fe vi while the reaction rate of flu without piperazine ring was relatively slow piperazine n4 amine underwent successive deprotonation over the ph range examined while speciation of piperazine n1 amine remains unchanged due to its weaker basicity e g estimated pka 0 7 for n1 of cf dodd et al 2005 therefore in the case of hocl clo2 and o3 where n4 amine was identified as the primary reactive site the reaction kinetics were highly ph dependent comparatively in the case of mn vii where n1 amine was the main site solution ph had slight effect on the reaction rates the strong ph dependency for the reactions of pms with fqs fig 3 indicated that piperazine n4 amine was the possible site for pms oxidation moreover it was noted that the reactivity of pms for ef was higher than that for cf this might be ascribed to their difference in the piperazine rings where ef contained tertiary n4 amine while cf contained secondary n4 amine similar finding was observed in the case of clo2 due to the higher reactivity of tertiary amines than secondary amines toward clo2 lee and von gunten 2010 neta et al 1988 wang et al 2010 comparatively in the cases of hocl and fe vi the reaction rates of cf were significantly higher than those of ef due to the fact that hocl and fe vi exhibited higher reactivity toward neutral secondary amines than tertiary amines abia et al 1998 dodd et al 2005 accordingly the reactivity of dma representative of secondary amines vs tma representative of tertiary amines toward pms was examined at ph 8 as expected pms exhibited stronger reactivity toward tma as compared to dma fig s3 3 5 oxidation products and reaction pathways oxidation products formed in the reactions of fqs with pms were analyzed by hplc esi ms ms chemical structures for these products were proposed upon the basis of their molecular ion mass product ion spectra and previously well reported information on product formation from fqs during various oxidative processes dodd et al 2005 hu et al 2011 wang et al 2010 zhang and huang 2005 for cf four products were detected and their proposed structures were shown in table s1 fig s4 showed the ms2 spectra of parent cf and four oxidation products the product ion spectrum of parent cf m z 332 showed that product ion of m z 314 was the abundant one which represented the loss of h2o from the carboxylate group of the quinolone ring these four products also exhibited similar fragmentation pattern m h h2o in product ion spectra suggesting the intact of the core fluoroquinolone structure in these products this was consistent with the kinetic result that flu was inert to pms oxidation fig s2 product i with molecular ion of m z 348 should be a hydroxylated cf ho cf since pms readily oxidized the n4 amine of piperazine the hydroxyl group might add on the n4 atom to form a hydroxylamine product ii m z 305 and product iii m z 306 with less molecular mass than cf were partial dealkylation products at the piperazine ring and product iv m z 263 was a fully dealkylated product at the piperazine ring two oxidation products were detected in the reaction of ef with pms table s2 and fig s5 similar to cf the transformation of ef occurred on the piperazine ring n4 amine and the fluoroquinolone structure remained intact product v had molecular ion of m z 376 indicating the addition of o atom on the piperazine ring comparing to parent ef m z 360 unlike cf ef contained a tertiary n4 amine with an additional ethyl group on the piperazine ring the oxidation of tertiary amines by peroxide i e h2o2 or pms could generate n oxide products albini 1991 1993 thus o atom might add on the tertiary n4 amine to form an n oxide product product v the formation of n oxide product was also proposed during mno2 and o3 oxidation of fqs dodd et al 2009 zhang and huang 2005 product vi m z 392 with an additional o atom than product v m z 376 was assigned to a further hydroxylation product of v the proposed oxidation pathways of cf and ef were shown in fig 5 a and b for cf pms initially attacks the n4 atom on the piperazine ring leading to the generation of hydroxylated product i or partially dealkylated product iii product i could be further transformed to dealkylated product ii product iii could undergo further oxidation leading to the formation of fully dealkylated product iv the fluoroquinolone structure of cf remained intact during the reactions for tertiary ef pms mainly attracted the n4 amine to generate n oxide products v and vi and they were hardly transformed to dealkylated products the proposed reaction mechanisms were consistent with the conclusions drawn from kinetics experiments that the n4 amine in the piperazine ring was the primary reactive site 3 6 antibacterial activity the effect of pms treatment on the antibacterial activity of fqs solutions was investigated by quantitative bioassays growth of e coli in the presence of untreated and pms treated fqs samples was reflected by δod600 fig 6 showed that the growth of e coli in the presence of pms treated samples was similar to that of untreated samples change of bacterial growth inhibition with fq concentration can be quantified by fitting measured data with a boltzmann curve eq 7 7 y a 2 a 1 a 2 1 e x x 0 d x where x is log of fq concentration m y is δod600 a 1 is the value of y corresponding to no growth inhibition a 2 is the value of y corresponding to maximum growth inhibition dx is the slope at the midpoint of the curve and x 0 is the midpoint for cf the calculated logec50 value 7 29 for pms treated samples was very similar to that of untreated samples 7 28 similar result was also observed in the case of ef where logec50 values for untreated and pms treated ef were 7 48 and 7 52 respectively these results suggested that oxidation products had a much lower antibacterial activity than parent fqs and the bacterial growth inhibition in the pms treated samples was mainly attributed to the residual fqs generally fqs exert their antibacterial effect by preventing bacterial dna from unwinding and duplicating drlica and malik 2003 the presence of the piperazine ring on the quinolone ring structure provides fqs with a considerably more potent antibacterial activity reaction kinetics and products identification have demonstrated that pms selectively oxidized the piperazine moiety of fqs thus it was not difficult to understand the effective antibacterial deactivation of fqs by pms treatment it was reported that the transformation of cf on the piperazine substituent by mn vii and o3 also showed a significant reduction of antibacterial activity dodd et al 2009 hu et al 2011 thus it can be concluded that a partial modification of the piperazine moiety of fqs via oxidation of n4 or n1 amines to the corresponding n oxide hydroxylated or partially dealkylated products is sufficient to diminish their antibacterial potency 3 7 treatment of fqs by pms in natural water kinetic experiments were conducted to examine whether the determined rate constants could predict the oxidation dynamics of fqs by pms in natural water degradation of cf 1 μm and ef 1 μm by pms 60 μm was conducted in surface water at ph 8 since the reactions of fqs with pms follow the secondary order kinetics the loss of fqs could be predicted by eq 8 8 c c 0 exp k app 0 t pms d t where 0 t pms d t is the pms exposure i e pms concentration integrated over time the decay of pms was found to be less than 10 fig s6 and thus pms exposure was approximate to pms 0 t the oxidation dynamics of cf and ef were modeled according to eq 8 as shown in fig 7 a and b dash lines the determined rate constants predicted the oxidation kinetics of cf and ef in surface water reasonably well this suggested that background matrices had negligible impact on fqs removal by pms comparatively it was well documented that background matrices such as bicarbonate and natural organic matter nom had great impact on pms based aops luo et al 2015 yang et al 2015 fig 7c d comparatively showed the removal of fqs in surface water by o3 fe vi mn vii and pms as can be seen except for mn vii an increasing removal of fqs was observed with the increase of oxidant concentrations for example with the oxidant concentration increased from 6 to 60 μm the degradation of cf by o3 fe vi and pms increased from 25 to 100 5 100 and 7 51 respectively the removal of fqs by mn vii at each concentration was negligible less than 5 which might be attributed to its sluggish reactivity toward fqs o3 was the most efficient oxidant for both cf and ef removal in surface water and this was in agreement with the fact that the second order rate constants of o3 with fqs were much higher than the other oxidants the performance of fe vi for cf removal was lower than o3 but higher than pms and this was not unexpected because the second order rate constant of fe vi with cf was much lower than o3 but higher than pms interestingly pms performed better than fe vi for ef degradation this result might be ascribed to the following reasons i the reaction rates of ef with pms and fe vi were similar at near neutral ph fig 4b and ii pms was much more stable than fe vi in surface water 4 conclusion this study investigated the reaction kinetics and oxidation products of two model fqs cf and ef by pms the effect of pms treatment on the antibacterial activity of fqs was examined the degradation kinetics of cf and ef by pms were also examined in natural water and the effectiveness of pms was evaluated and compared with o3 mn vii and fe vi the findings of this study were summarized as follows i reaction kinetics between pms with fqs were described by a second order rate law the reaction rates showed strong ph dependency with apparent second order rate constants of 0 10 13 05 m 1s 1 for cf and 0 51 33 17 m 1s 1 for ef at ph 5 10 this ph dependency was well described by species specific parallel reactions between fqs and pms ii transformation of fqs by pms yielded hydroxylated n oxide and dealkylated products via oxidation of tertiary and secondary aliphatic n4 amines on the piperazine ring the oxidation products had a much lower antibacterial activity than parent fqs iii the determined rate constants predicted the oxidation kinetics of fqs by pms in surface water reasonably well and background matrices had negligible impact the degradation efficiency of fqs by pms in surface water was slightly lower than that by o3 comparable to that by fe vi and much higher than that by mn vii acknowledgement this work was

19306,while fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics are susceptible to degradation by sulfate and or hydroxyl radicals formed in peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes here we report that unactivated pms itself exhibits a specific high reactivity toward fqs for the first time reaction kinetics of pms with two model fqs ciprofloxacin cf and enrofloxacin ef showed a strong ph dependency with apparent second order rate constants of 0 10 13 05 m 1s 1 for cf and 0 51 33 17 m 1s 1 for ef at ph 5 10 this ph dependency was well described by species specific parallel reactions on the basis

chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass analysis showed the formation of hydroxylated n oxide and dealkylated products bacterial growth inhibition bioassays using escherichia coli showed that oxidation products of fqs by pms retained negligible antibacterial potency in comparison to parent fqs kinetic modeling using the rate constants estimated from pure water well predicted the oxidation kinetics of low levels of cf and ef by pms in surface water the degradation efficiency of fqs by pms in surface water was slightly lower than that by ozone comparable to that by ferrate and much higher than that by permanganate these results suggest that pms is a promising oxidant for the treatment of fqs in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate fluoroquinolone

been received little attention in previous studies pms with a standard redox potential e h 0 of 1 82 v may act as a mild oxidant betterton and hoffmann 1990 for example wang et al 2014 reported that pms was capable of directly oxidizing arsenite to arsenate with a relatively high rate yang et al 2018 showed that pms without activation could appreciably oxidize the commonly used singlet oxygen 1o2

product ion spectra i e ida antibacterial activity analysis escherichia coli e coli had been widely used as model bacteria to assess the antibacterial activity of fqs in this study the effect of pms treatment on the antibacterial activity of fqs solutions was also examined by using e coli as the test bacteria a series of ph buffered solutions ph 8 containing target fqs 100 μm were treated by

surface water at ph 8 spiked with cf or ef 1 μm reactions were initiated by adding pms 60 μm following the similar procedure to that in synthetic buffer solutions the transformation efficiency of fqs by pms in surface water was compared with o3 fe vi and mn vii a series of surface water samples containing 1 μm cf or ef were treated by each oxidant doses of 0 6 12 30 and 60 μm under vigorous

kinetics fig 2 a showed the time course profiles of the degradation of fqs 5 μm by pms 0 42 mm at ph 8 fqs were stable in absence of pms while appreciable degradation of fqs was achieved in the presence of pms quenching studies were conducted to verify whether reactive radicals i e so4 and oh were involved in the degradation of fqs by pms it was found that methanol and tert butanol in excess had negligible influence on the degradation of cf suggesting that neither so4 nor oh was participated in the degradation of fqs by pms fig s1 for example it is well known that 1o2 can be generated from the self decomposition of pms in aqueous solutions edwards et al 1979 evans and upton 1985 zhou et al 2015 the involvement of 1o2 was also excluded by quenching studies where nan3 an efficient quencher for 1o2 had negligible effect on the degradation of cf see fig s1 for example this was consistent with the finding obtained by yang et al 2018 that 1o2 only played a minor role in the oxidation of ffa by pms because the generation rate of 1o2 from self decomposition of pms was very slow and the quenching effect of 1o2 by water was very strong haag et al 1984 yang et al 2018 these results suggested that pms itself rather than its activation products i e so4 oh and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of fqs the loss of cf and ef in the presence of excess pms all exhibited pseudo first order kinetics over the ph range of 5 10 insert in fig 2a for example indicating that the reactions were first order with respect to these two fqs the measured pseudo first order rates k obs increased linearly with the increase of pms concentration fig 2b for example demonstrating that the reactions were also first order with respect to pms therefore the apparent second order rate constant k app could be determined by eq 1 1 d fq tot d t k app pms tot fq tot where pms tot and fq tot represent the total concentrations of pms hso5 and so5 2 and fq species respectively as shown in fig 3 the k app values of cf and ef exhibited strong ph dependency for instance k app cf substantially increased above ph 5 with a maximum occurring near ph 9 and then decreased as ph further increased these ph dependent rate profiles might be ascribed to a combined effect of pms speciation eq 2 goodman and robson 1963 and fqs speciation fig 1b and c where deprotonation of fqs contributed to the increase in reaction rates while deprotonation of pms ion hso5 resulted in the decrease of reaction rates 2 hso 5 so 5 2 h pka 9 3 3 2 kinetic modeling of ph dependency of rate constants cf and ef were amphoteric compounds exhibiting the acid base speciation fig 1b and c according to previous studies it was difficult to make an accurate micro speciation modeling since the reported values of micro speciation constants i e k 11 and k 21 differed distinctly for a given fq hernàndez borrell and montero 1997 ross and riley 1992 alternatively the speciation of fqs was modeled according to macro speciation patterns the combination of zwitterion and neutral species was considered as a single effective species cf and ef could be considered as diprotic acids for their piperazinyl n4 amine and carboxylate group and their pka values were exhibited in fig 1b and c luis vázquez et al 2001 zhang and huang 2005 the macroscopic k a1 is corresponding to the piperazinyl n4 amine and the macroscopic k a2 is corresponding to the carboxylate group the ph dependency of k app for each fq could be quantitatively modeled by eq 3 3 k app pms tot fq tot i 1 2 j 1 2 3 k ij α i pms tot β j fq tot where αi and βj represent the respective species distribution coefficients for pms and target fq i and j represent pms species i e hso5 or so5 2 and fq species i e cationic fq zwitterion neutral fq or anionic fq respectively and k ij represents the species specific second order rate constant for the reaction between pms species i with fq species j the reactions of pms with fq were neglected in the model calculations because k app values decreased with decreasing ph and became very low at ph 5 this result suggested that pms was unreactive toward cationic fqs since so5 2 always exhibited lower oxidizing capacity than hso5 chen et al 2018 lente et al 2009 zhou et al 2017 2018 the reactions of so5 2 with fq and fq were preliminarily neglected in the model calculation for simplification consequently the following reactions eqs 4 and 5 were initially proposed as main reactions between pms and fqs to explain the ph dependency of the reaction rates 4 hso 5 fq k 12 products 5 hso 5 fq k 13 products the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 6 k app k 12 α 1 β 2 k 13 α 1 β 3 the species specific second order rate constants k ij were calculated according to nonlinear least squares regressions of experimental k app values as can be seen the fit between experimental data and model ones was satisfactory fig 3 validating that the overall reactions were dominated by reactions 4 5 the calculated k ij values were summarized in table 1 specific second order rate constants of hso5 with zwitterion neutral fq species k 12 were 1 57 m 1s 1 for cf and 6 88 m 1s 1 for ef respectively which were much lower than those with fq 30 00 and 43 40 m 1s 1 respectively this result suggested that fq was more susceptible to pms oxidation the contribution of species specific reactions to the overall k app was also depicted in fig 3 for cf the reaction of hso5 with zwitterion neutral cf k 1 2 α1 β2 dominated at ph 7 5 and the reaction of hso5 with cf k 1 3 α1 β3 was predominant at ph 7 5 similar result was also observed in the case of ef 3 3 comparison of pms with common oxidants a comparison of the ph dependent k app for the reactions of selective oxidants i e free chlorine hocl chlorine dioxide clo2 o3 mn vii fe vi and pms with cf and ef was made in fig 4 a and b respectively dodd et al 2005 2006 hu et al 2010 lee et al 2009 wang et al 2010 for cf the reaction rates of hocl 2 7 104 1 4 106 m 1s 1 clo2 0 34 183 m 1s 1 o3 9 5 102 8 6 105 m 1s 1 and fe vi 6 60 416 m 1s 1 were much higher than those of pms 0 10 13 05 m 1s 1 in the ph range of 5 10 while pms exhibited higher reactivity than mn vii 0 50 1 18 m 1s 1 when ph 6 at near neutral ph the second order rate constants of pms with ef were comparable with those of fe vi but lower than hocl clo2 and o3 3 4 reactive sites the reactions of pms with flu and pp i e structurally related fluoroquinolone and piperazine portions were examined as shown in fig s2 negligible flu was degraded by pms while pp could be rapidly degraded by pms at ph 8 these results suggested that quinolone moiety was refractory to pms oxidation and the piperazine moiety containing aromatic amine and secondary or tertiary aliphatic amine was the reactive site the piperazine ring was also identified as the reactive site of fqs in the case of other oxidants e g hocl clo2 o3 mn vii fe vi and mno2 dodd et al 2005 2006 wang et al 2010 hu et al 2011 lee et al 2009 zhang and huang 2005 feng et al 2016 for example feng et al 2016 found that ef was rapidly degraded by fe vi while the reaction rate of flu without piperazine ring was relatively slow piperazine n4 amine underwent successive deprotonation over the ph range examined while speciation of piperazine n1 amine remains unchanged due to its weaker basicity e g estimated pka 0 7 for n1 of cf dodd et al 2005 therefore in the case of hocl clo2 and o3 where n4 amine was identified as the primary reactive site the reaction kinetics were highly ph dependent comparatively in the case of mn vii where n1 amine was the main site solution ph had slight effect on the reaction rates the strong ph dependency for the reactions of pms with fqs fig 3 indicated that piperazine n4 amine was the possible site for pms oxidation moreover it was noted that the reactivity of pms for ef was higher than that for cf this might be ascribed to their difference in the piperazine rings where ef contained tertiary n4 amine while cf contained secondary n4 amine similar finding was observed in the case of clo2 due to the higher reactivity of tertiary amines than secondary amines toward clo2 lee and von gunten 2010 neta et al 1988 wang et al 2010 comparatively in the cases of hocl and fe vi the reaction rates of cf were significantly higher than those of ef due to the fact that hocl and fe vi exhibited higher reactivity toward neutral secondary amines than tertiary amines abia et al 1998 dodd et al 2005 accordingly the reactivity of dma representative of secondary amines vs tma representative of tertiary amines toward pms was examined at ph 8 as expected pms exhibited stronger reactivity toward tma as compared to dma fig s3 3 5 oxidation products and reaction pathways oxidation products formed in the reactions of fqs with pms were analyzed by hplc esi ms ms chemical structures for these products were proposed upon the basis of their molecular ion mass product ion spectra and previously well reported information on product formation from fqs during various oxidative processes dodd et al 2005 hu et al 2011 wang et al 2010 zhang and huang 2005 for cf four products were detected and their proposed structures were shown in table s1 fig s4 showed the ms2 spectra of parent cf and four oxidation products the product ion spectrum of parent cf m z 332 showed that product ion of m z 314 was the abundant one which represented the loss of h2o from the carboxylate group of the quinolone ring these four products also exhibited similar fragmentation pattern m h h2o in product ion spectra suggesting the intact of the core fluoroquinolone structure in these products this was consistent with the kinetic result that flu was inert to pms oxidation fig s2 product i with molecular ion of m z 348 should be a hydroxylated cf ho cf since pms readily oxidized the n4 amine of piperazine the hydroxyl group might add on the n4 atom to form a hydroxylamine product ii m z 305 and product iii m z 306 with less molecular mass than cf were partial dealkylation products at the piperazine ring and product iv m z 263 was a fully dealkylated product at the piperazine ring two oxidation products were detected in the reaction of ef with pms table s2 and fig s5 similar to cf the transformation of ef occurred on the piperazine ring n4 amine and the fluoroquinolone structure remained intact product v had molecular ion of m z 376 indicating the addition of o atom on the piperazine ring comparing to parent ef m z 360 unlike cf ef contained a tertiary n4 amine with an additional ethyl group on the piperazine ring the oxidation of tertiary amines by peroxide i e h2o2 or pms could generate n oxide products albini 1991 1993 thus o atom might add on the tertiary n4 amine to form an n oxide product product v the formation of n oxide product was also proposed during mno2 and o3 oxidation of fqs dodd et al 2009 zhang and huang 2005 product vi m z 392 with an additional o atom than product v m z 376 was assigned to a further hydroxylation product of v the proposed oxidation pathways of cf and ef were shown in fig 5 a and b for cf pms initially attacks the n4 atom on the piperazine ring leading to the generation of hydroxylated product i or partially dealkylated product iii product i could be further transformed to dealkylated product ii product iii could undergo further oxidation leading to the formation of fully dealkylated product iv the fluoroquinolone structure of cf remained intact during the reactions for tertiary ef pms mainly attracted the n4 amine to generate n oxide products v and vi and they were hardly transformed to dealkylated products the proposed reaction mechanisms were consistent with the conclusions drawn from kinetics experiments that the n4 amine in the piperazine ring was the primary reactive site 3 6 antibacterial activity the effect of pms treatment on the antibacterial activity of fqs solutions was investigated by quantitative bioassays growth of e coli in the presence of untreated and pms treated fqs samples was reflected by δod600 fig 6 showed that the growth of e coli in the presence of pms treated samples was similar to that of untreated samples change of bacterial growth inhibition with fq concentration can be quantified by fitting measured data with a boltzmann curve eq 7 7 y a 2 a 1 a 2 1 e x x 0 d x where x is log of fq concentration m y is δod600 a 1 is the value of y corresponding to no growth inhibition a 2 is the value of y corresponding to maximum growth inhibition dx is the slope at the midpoint of the curve and x 0 is the midpoint for cf the calculated logec50 value 7 29 for pms treated samples was very similar to that of untreated samples 7 28 similar result was also observed in the case of ef where logec50 values for untreated and pms treated ef were 7 48 and 7 52 respectively these results suggested that oxidation products had a much lower antibacterial activity than parent fqs and the bacterial growth inhibition in the pms treated samples was mainly attributed to the residual fqs generally fqs exert their antibacterial effect by preventing bacterial dna from unwinding and duplicating drlica and malik 2003 the presence of the piperazine ring on the quinolone ring structure provides fqs with a considerably more potent antibacterial activity reaction kinetics and products identification have demonstrated that pms selectively oxidized the piperazine moiety of fqs thus it was not difficult to understand the effective antibacterial deactivation of fqs by pms treatment it was reported that the transformation of cf on the piperazine substituent by mn vii and o3 also showed a significant reduction of antibacterial activity dodd et al 2009 hu et al 2011 thus it can be concluded that a partial modification of the piperazine moiety of fqs via oxidation of n4 or n1 amines to the corresponding n oxide hydroxylated or partially dealkylated products is sufficient to diminish their antibacterial potency 3 7 treatment of fqs by pms in natural water kinetic experiments were conducted to examine whether the determined rate constants could predict the oxidation dynamics of fqs by pms in natural water degradation of cf 1 μm and ef 1 μm by pms 60 μm was conducted in surface water at ph 8 since the reactions of fqs with pms follow the secondary order kinetics the loss of fqs could be predicted by eq 8 8 c c 0 exp k app 0 t pms d t where 0 t pms d t is the pms exposure i e pms concentration integrated over time the decay of pms was found to be less than 10 fig s6 and thus pms exposure was approximate to pms 0 t the oxidation dynamics of cf and ef were modeled according to eq 8 as shown in fig 7 a and b dash lines the determined rate constants predicted the oxidation kinetics of cf and ef in surface water reasonably well this suggested that background matrices had negligible impact on fqs removal by pms comparatively it was well documented that background matrices such as bicarbonate and natural organic matter nom had great impact on pms based aops luo et al 2015 yang et al 2015 fig 7c d comparatively showed the removal of fqs in surface water by o3 fe vi mn vii and pms as can be seen except for mn vii an increasing removal of fqs was observed with the increase of oxidant concentrations for example with the oxidant concentration increased from 6 to 60 μm the degradation of cf by o3 fe vi and pms increased from 25 to 100 5 100 and 7 51 respectively the removal of fqs by mn vii at each concentration was negligible less than 5 which might be attributed to its sluggish reactivity toward fqs o3 was the most efficient oxidant for both cf and ef removal in surface water and this was in agreement with the fact that the second order rate constants of o3 with fqs were much higher than the other oxidants the performance of fe vi for cf removal was lower than o3 but higher than pms and this was not unexpected because the second order rate constant of fe vi with cf was much lower than o3 but higher than pms interestingly pms performed better than fe vi for ef degradation this result might be ascribed to the following reasons i the reaction rates of ef with pms and fe vi were similar at near neutral ph fig 4b and ii pms was much more stable than fe vi in surface water 4 conclusion this study investigated the reaction kinetics and oxidation products of two model fqs cf and ef by pms the effect of pms treatment on the antibacterial activity of fqs was examined the degradation kinetics of cf and ef by pms were also examined in natural water and the effectiveness of pms was evaluated and compared with o3 mn vii and fe vi the findings of this study were summarized as follows i reaction kinetics between pms with fqs were described by a second order rate law the reaction rates showed strong ph dependency with apparent second order rate constants of 0 10 13 05 m 1s 1 for cf and 0 51 33 17 m 1s 1 for ef at ph 5 10 this ph dependency was well described by species specific parallel reactions between fqs and pms ii transformation of fqs by pms yielded hydroxylated n oxide and dealkylated products via oxidation of tertiary and secondary aliphatic n4 amines on the piperazine ring the oxidation products had a much lower antibacterial activity than parent fqs iii the determined rate constants predicted the oxidation kinetics of fqs by pms in surface water reasonably well and background matrices had negligible impact the degradation efficiency of fqs by pms in surface water was slightly lower than that by o3 comparable to that by fe vi and much higher than that by mn vii acknowledgement this work was

19307,ammonia nitrogen removal from wastewaters has gained much attention in recent decades as a result of the environmental problems associated with discharge of excessive amounts of this critical nutrient including eutrophication of receiving waters generation of offensive odours as a result of organism decay and complications associated with the disinfection of water supplies while removal via biological processes represents the principal means by which a reduction in dissolved nitrogen concentrations is achieved an electrochemical advanced oxidation process has been proposed as a potentially effective alternate means of removing ammonia from wastewaters with the removal associated with the in situ generation of oxidants particularly active chlorine at the anode here we describe the influence of key factors on the rate and extent of ammonia nitrogen removal in an electrochemical cell with a ti iro2 ruo2 anode and ti cathode the rate of ammonia removal was found to be dependent on both current density and initial chloride concentration with 95 ammonia removed from a 20 mm cl solution within approximately 40 min at a current density of 3 ma cm 2 resulting in an energy consumption of 126 kwh kg 1 nh4 n additionally we show that by products formation is effectively suppressed during the electrolysis process a mechanistically based kinetic model incorporating the key processes operating in the ammonia electro oxidation process was developed with particular attention given to i anodic generation of active chlorine and other chloride related by products ii active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation the results demonstrate that the electrochemical advanced oxidation process is a promising technology for treatment of ammonia containing wastewaters with advantages including simplicity safety and effectiveness graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical advanced oxidation process ammonia oxidation active chlorine kinetic model 1 introduction ammonia removal from wastewaters has attracted much attention in recent decades given the concerns associated with discharge of this critical nutrient with particular problems including eutrophication

zhang et al 2017 biological nitrification denitrification kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 and break point chlorination pressley et al 1972 have been applied extensively in the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters with each of these technologies exhibiting particular limitations for example air stripping consumes large amounts of energy and may result in air pollution problems when ammonia is transformed from aqueous to gas phase additionally this technology exhibits poor removal efficiency at low ammonia concentrations obaid ur rehman and beg 1990 biological methods require a series of reactors to achieve the range of functions required i e nitrification denitrification and solid liquid separation with the denitrification efficiency largely constrained by the biodegradable organic content in the wastewater ruiz et al 2003 breakpoint chlorination possesses risks related to the transport storage and the handling of active chlorine with challenges also associated with the optimization of the dosing of active chlorine in recent years an electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop has emerged as a promising approach to ammonia removal with advantages including minimal production of secondary waste amenability to automation versatility and safety li and liu 2009 pérez et al 2012a it has been reported that eaops are effective for the treatment of ammonia containing wastewaters from tanneries vlyssides and israilides 1997 power plants vanlangendonck et al 2005 municipal sources li and liu 2009 and landfills ye et al 2016 ammonia in either ammonium ion nh4 or deprotonated nh3 aq forms can be removed by i direct anodic oxidation and or ii indirect oxidation mediated by the electro generated active chlorine in the direct oxidation pathway nh3 is firstly adsorbed to the anode surface and subsequently decomposed principally to harmless nitrogen gas as a result of anodic electron transfer as shown in eq 1 kapałka et al 2010 kim et al 2006 zöllig et al 2015b 1 2 nh 3 6 oh n 2 6 h 2 o 6 e however direct ammonia oxidation requires the adjustment of wastewater ph to values greater than the pk a of the nh4 nh3 acid base pair i e ph 9 25 because nh4 cannot be oxidized directly at the anode zöllig et al 2015a furthermore the low reaction rate and high cost of the electrodes usually platinum restricts the practical application of this technology zöllig et al 2015b indirect oxidation which takes advantage of in situ generation of active chlorine at the anode to oxidize ammonia to nitrogen gas is more commonly used ji et al 2017 kapałka et al 2010 li and liu 2009 zhang et al 2018b this approach is much faster more efficient and cost effective than direct oxidation provided sufficient chloride ion 300 mg l 1 is present in the wastewater stream kim et al 2006 the overall reactions resulting in n2 production are as follows 2 2 cl cl 2 2 e 3 cl 2 h 2 o hocl h cl 4 2 nh 4 3 hocl n 2 3 h 2 o 5 h 3 cl limited insight regarding the precise mechanism and reaction kinetics of the active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation process is currently available traditionally it has been considered that the indirect electrochemical ammonia oxidation process eaop occurs via a mechanism similar to that of the intensively studied breakpoint chlorination that is ammonia first reacts with the active chlorine species hocl or ocl and stepwise generates chloramine species i e monochloramine dichloramine and trichloramine and finally nitrogen gas when the active chlorine ammonia mole ratio gradually reaches 1 5 mergerum et al 1978 qiang and adams 2004 however results of a number of electrochemical indirect ammonia oxidation studies indicate that the transformation of ammonia into nitrogen gas takes place at the very beginning of the electrolysis process and long before an active chlorine ammonia mole ratio of 1 5 is attained kim et al 2006 li and liu 2009 vanlangendonck et al 2005 these findings suggest that the mechanism of eaop differs from that of the conventional breakpoint chlorination process and as such requires clarification not surprisingly given the variety of faradaic reactions that may occur at both anode and cathode as well as the various solution phase reactions that may influence the rate and extent of ammonia oxidation there has been limited attempt to develop mechanistically based models of the overall process as such the objectives of this work are to i determine the effects of operating parameters such as initial chloride concentration and current density on the rate and extent of ammonia removal and ii development of a detailed mechanistically based kinetic model providing insight into the complex interactions that occur during electrochemically mediated ammonia oxidation processes that will assist in optimising implementation of the technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents all solutions were prepared using ultrapure 18 mω cm milli q water mq millipore analytical

calculations a range of factors influencing ammonia removal in the electrochemical advanced oxidation process was investigated including applied current density initial cl concentration initial ph ph0 and initial ammonia concentration during our experiments a dc power source was used to provide constant current densities ranged from 1 to 5 ma cm 2 for the electrochemical cell initial cl concentrations varied from 5 mm to 50 mm wastewater ph0 values were adjusted using either 1 m naoh or 1 m h2so4 each experiment was operated in batch mode and lasted for 90 min samples were taken from

hypothesized reaction set describing all key chemical reactions occurring in the system the concentrations of reactants and products given specific initial conditions and rate constants predicted to be present at any given time during the electrochemically mediated active chlorine production and ammonia oxidation processes were determined by numerically solving the differential equations corresponding to the rate expressions for the hypothesized reactions using the kinetic modelling software kintek explorer https kintekcorp com johnson et al 2009 qiu et al 2015 sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the kinetic modeling software kintecus http kintecus com by determining eigenvectors following previously published methods pham and waite 2008 vajda et al 1985 xing et al 2018 3 results 3 1 chlorine evolution the electrochemical system was first employed for examination of the evolution of chlorine species in the absence of ammonia at initial cl concentrations of 10 mm and 20 mm under three different current densities i e 1 3 and 5 ma cm 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the gradual loss of cl with a concomitant increase in active chlorine concentration indicated that cl was converted into active chlorine at the anode surface reactions 1 6 in table 1 higher current density and initial cl concentration resulted in faster active chlorine formation and higher steady state concentrations of active chlorine for example when an initial cl concentration of 20 mm was applied during the electrolysis steady state active chlorine concentrations of 1 4 1 5 2 7 2 9 and 3 3 3 5 mm were obtained at current densities of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 1 respectively a similar dependence was observed for the 10 mm cl case with active chlorine concentrations reaching 0 8 0 9 1 3 1 5 and 1 5 1 8 mm at current densities of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 1 respectively 3 2 active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation fig 2 demonstrates the effects of current density and cl concentration on the removal of ammonia during 90 min reaction it can be seen from these results that a higher current density leads to more rapid ammonia oxidation when a current density of 1 ma cm 2 was applied only 9 0 of nh4 n could be degraded in 40 min at an initial cl concentration of 10 mm the removal rates increased dramatically to 43 2 and 88 0 on increasing the current density to 3 and 5 ma cm 2 respectively a similar trend was observed for the 20 mm cl case while enhanced ammonia removal rates i e 17 8 87 5 and 97 7 were observed following 90 min operation at current densities of 1 5 ma cm 2 the variation of nh4 n concentrations for different initial cl concentrations is presented in fig s2 an initial cl concentration of 5 mm was too low to achieve an effective result when the cl concentration was higher than 10 mm the treatment was satisfactory with the near complete ammonia removal in 10 40 and 80 min in the solutions containing 50 20 and 10 mm cl respectively initial ph was observed to exert much less significant influence on ammonia removal than either current density or cl concentration in our electrochemical system as can be seen from fig s3 the degradation of ammonia exhibited little difference for various initial ph conditions ph0 3 6 and 9 bulk solution ph decreased during the electrolysis process to similar values whatever the initial ph fig s4 with this decrease a result of the abundant generation of h through both hypochlorite generation and indirect ammonia oxidation reactions reactions 3 and 4 and as a result of other side reactions such as water splitting fig s4 in addition the insignificant effect of initial ph on ammonia removal could be attributed to the fact that ammonia degradation mainly takes place close to the anode surface where the local ph is likely to be minimally affected by initial ph other investigators have also found that initial ph exerts little impact on ammonia degradation while current density and cl concentration appear to be the rate determining parameters li and liu 2009 xiao et al 2009 results showing the effects of initial ammonium concentrations and current density are provided in the supplementary information figs s5 and s6 fig 3 shows the temporal variation in cl and active chlorine concentrations during ammonia oxidation in all cases the concentration of cl was relatively stable until nh4 n was completely removed specifically obvious decrease in the cl concentration occurred following 70 and 40 min reaction at 3 and 5 ma cm 2 at an initial cl of 10 mm fig 3a while increase in the initial cl concentration to 20 mm resulted in a similar but earlier decrease in cl concentrations fig 3b in comparison when the current density was fixed at 1 ma cm 2 no significant change in chloride concentrations was observed with this result likely associated with the residual of ammonia in the solutions over the course of the experiments fig 2 active chlorine was also monitored as it plays a crucial role in ammonia removal through the aforementioned reactions eqs 2 4 initially a low concentration of active chlorine was detected due to its rapid consumption in the indirect ammonia oxidation process while it increased to a relatively high value following the complete degradation of ammonia fig 3c and d with the use of 10 mm cl active chlorine began to accumulate from 40 min to 70 min at current densities of 5to3 ma cm 2 respectively for a higher initial cl concentration of 20 mm the concentration of active chlorine increased earlier fig 3d it should be noted that the steady state concentrations of resultant active chlorine were quite comparable to the control experiments fig 1 in contrast the active chlorine concentrations were low throughout the whole electrolysis process at 1 ma cm 2 it is expected that the electrochemical ammonia oxidation process commences with the anodic oxidation of cl to active chlorine which subsequently reacts with ammonia resulting in the production of nitrogen gas eqs 2 4 meanwhile active chlorine is reduced to cl the dashed lines in fig 3 represent the time up until which the cl concentration does not change significantly and active chlorine does not accumulate as prior to these critical times it is reacting with ammonia that is still present as such cl can be regarded as a catalyst for electrochemical ammonia degradation up to these times however once the concentration of ammonia has decreased to zero the cl concentration begins to decrease with active chlorine thereafter accumulating in a manner similar to that shown in fig 1 3 3 by products generation the generation of hazardous by products such as chlorate and perchlorate is one main drawback of eaops applied to water wastewater containing chloride in our system chlorate was the only chloro species detected in all conditions with the concentrations of perchlorate well below the detection limit the formation of chlorate during the electrolysis of the solution without ammonia is shown in fig 4 a and b relatively low concentrations of chlorate were generated at the lowest current density applied 1 ma cm 2 not surprisingly chlorate concentration increased on increasing the applied current density to 5 ma cm 2 with 112 and 193 μm chlorate produced after 90 min electrolysis of solutions containing 10 mm and 20 mm cl nevertheless the final chlorate concentrations in this electrochemical cell were less than 1 of the initial cl concentration which is one order of magnitude lower than those observed in other similar electrochemical ammonia removal systems jung et al 2010 lin et al 2016 suggesting that by products generation was suppressed in our cell when ammonia was present in the electrolyte as shown in fig 4c and d the formation of chlorate was initially inhibited but increased rapidly once ammonia had been completely removed as a result of oxidation by electro generated chlorine with an initial cl concentration of 10 mm the chlorate concentration reached 0 5 1 2 and 1 9 μm at the time point when most ammonia was removed at current densities of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 2 respectively for a higher initial cl concentration fig 4d the chlorate generation was relatively faster with 1 2 2 0 and 2 4 μm formed at the end of the ammonia removal period for current densities respectively of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 2 these values are lower than the guideline 8 4 μm suggested by who who 2011 though once ammonia was exhausted the chlorate production exhibited a similar trend to the ammonia free cases fig 4a and b with the chlorate concentrations increasing to more than 100 μm following 90 min of reaction during the sequential oxidation of ammonia with in situ generated free chlorine most of the ammonia would be expected to convert to n2 reactions 7 10 in table 1 though a portion could transform into other nitrogenous by products such as nitrite and nitrate via reactions such as that shown in eq 7 7 nh 4 4 hocl no 3 h 2 o 6 h 4 cl in all experiments described here the concentration of nitrite was below the detection limit while a small quantity of nitrate was observed typical profiles of nitrate formation are shown in fig 5 with the production of nitrate commencing at the beginning of each experiment and the concentration increasing continuously until a plateau was reached at approximately the time at which ammonia was totally removed the generation rate of nitrate increased with increase in current density and initial cl concentration with the nitrate concentration reaching more than 100 μm when 5 ma cm 2 current density and 20 mm cl were used nevertheless this value is far below drinking water guideline values 806 μm who 2011 due to very limited information on steady state concentration of nitrite only an overall reaction reaction 12 in table 1 has been introduced to the kinetic model with a reasonable description of formation of nitrate achieved from the kinetic modelling of our experimental data fig 5 possible ph dependence of the rate of this reaction could account for the small differences observed between model and experimental values chloramine is potentially another nitrogen by product that could be formed during the active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation process in our experiments however minimal concentrations of chloramine 10 μm were detected after 90 min electrolysis with this accounting for less than 0 5 of the initial nh4 n concentration data not shown 3 4 current efficiency and energy consumption as mentioned earlier current efficiency and energy consumption are two key parameters used to evaluate the performance of electrochemical processes as illustrated in fig 6 a at a current density of 3 ma cm 2 the current efficiency ce was 2 9 for a 5 mm cl solution but increased sharply to 6 7 14 6 and 46 1 if higher cl concentrations of 10 20 and 50 mm were employed results presented in fig 6b indicate that the current efficiency first increased with increase in current density and then decreased with the maximum value achieved at 3 ma cm 2 in contrast energy consumption exhibits a negative relationship with cl concentration the electrochemical cell operated with initial cl concentration of 50 mm and current density of 3 ma cm 2 consumed the lowest energy 39 9 kwh kg n 1 of the various operating conditions examined with this value one order of magnitude lower than that reported in previous work yang et al 2016 fig 6c and d 4 discussion although the electrochemical ammonia oxidation process has now been described by a number of investigators understanding of the detailed mechanism of chlorine evolution and ammonia removal remains relatively preliminary to assist our understanding we here in develop a mechanistically based kinetic model to describe the anodic chlorine evolution and the resultant indirect ammonia oxidation processes the core components of the model include i active chlorine evolution during the electrolysis of nacl solution in the absence of ammonia and ii indirect ammonia oxidation by in situ generated active chlorine table 1 4 1 active chlorine evolution the in situ electro generated free chlorine is recognized to be the principal agent responsible for the oxidation of ammonia fig 1 shows the electrolytic generation of chlorine in the absence of ammonia with the observed behaviour following the classical volmer heyrovsky v h mechanism hansen et al 2010 trasatti 1987 according to this mechanism chloride ion is first adsorbed on the metal oxide electrode and is transformed into the chloride radical and in the process releases an electron reaction 1 in table 1 8 mo x cl k 1 mo x cl e in the following heyrovsky step the generated cl combines with the cl near the electrodes to produce chlorine reaction 2 in table 1 9 mo x cl cl k 2 mo x cl 2 e alternatively two cl radicals can combine and generate chlorine through the volmer tafel reaction reaction 3 in table 1 10 mo x cl mo x cl k 3 2 mo x cl 2 subsequently the hydrolysis of cl2 occurs reaction 4 in table 1 11 cl 2 h 2 o k 4 hocl h cl the hypochlorous acid generated at the anode can then be reduced to chloride ion at the cathode surface reaction 5 in table 1 12 hocl 2 e k 5 cl oh the main side reactions involve the further anodic oxidation of hocl ocl to chlorate reaction 6 in table 1 yang et al 2016 13 mo x 2 h 2 o hocl k 6 mo x clo 3 5 h 4 e here reaction 1 and reaction 5 in table 1 are the two key reactions that determine formation and decay of active chlorine while reaction 6 has an insignificant effect as the transformation of active chlorine to chlorate is negligible indeed the active chlorine concentration was controlled by the ratio of reactions 1 and 5 by maintaining the ratio of the rate constants for reactions 1 and 5 constant at each current density we can obtain the values of these rate constants on the basis of best fit to the experimental data for formation of active chlorine and decay of cl fig 1 as illustrated in table 1 the rate constants of reactions 1 and 5 k 1 and k 5 showed a strong dependency on current density for instance the rate constant of cl formation k 1 increased from 0 2 10 4 s 1 to 2 3 10 4 s 1 as the applied current density increased from 1 ma cm 2 to 5 ma cm 2 meanwhile the cathodic chlorine reduction reaction exhibited a rate constant ranging from 1 8 10 4 s 1 to 11 10 4 s 1 with its occurrence leading to the achievement of steady state concentrations of active chlorine fig 1 fig s7 shows that the values of these rate constants correlate linearly with the current densities r 2 0 98 the rate constant for reaction 6 was obtained by fitting the experimental data for chlorate generation fig 4a and b it should be noted that the rate and extent of generation of active chlorine is largely determined by the nature of the anode materials used in previous work linear sweep voltammetry was used to determine the active chlorine evolution potentials of the three most widely used eaop electrodes i e bdd ti iro2 ruo2 and ti iro2 ta2o5 of these electrodes ti iro2 ruo2 exhibited a lower chlorine evolution potential 1 10 v vs sce than ti iro2 ta2o5 1 11 v vs sce and bdd anodes 1 98 v vs sce with this comparison indicating that active chlorine production reaction 1 4 should be more facile at a ti iro2 ruo2 anode than at a bdd anode on application of the same voltage zhou et al 2011 moreover mixed metal oxides such as iro2 ruo2 have been found to increase the activity selectivity and stability of the anode with these materials providing active sites for radical cl formation and the redox transitions of ruo x v iv and iro x iv vi serving as electron sinks arikawa et al 1998 ferro and de battisti 2002 in our eaop system the rate constant for cl formation k 1 on the ti iro2 ruo2 anode used was more than one order larger than that obtained in previous similar work using a multilayer heterojunction sbsn coti ir anode yang et al 2016 chlorate appeared to be the only stable chloride related by product generated during the electrolysis process with perchlorate concentrations below detection limit as illustrated in table 1 the chlorate formation rate constant k 6 is two orders of magnitude lower than k 1 with this result in line with previous findings that the iro2 ruo2 anode is conducive to catalysing the generation of active chlorine but satisfyingly does little to facilitate the conversion of chlorine to by products such as chlorate and perchlorate bagastyo et al 2011 zöllig et al 2015c 4 2 chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation as the identity and rate constants for the key reactions of the traditional breakpoint chlorination process have been reasonably well established we combined the established ammonia reaction set reaction 7 12 in table 1 with the reactions describing the electrochemical active chlorine evolution reaction 1 6 in table 1 in order to fully elucidate the mechanism and kinetics of the electrochemically assisted ammonia oxidation processes it should be noted that reaction 5 in table 1 actually plays a minor role in the kinetic model of ammonia oxidation since the in situ generated active chlorine will be immediately consumed near the anode surface when ammonia is present in solution thereby rendering the cathodic chlorine reduction reaction reaction 5 in table 1 unlikely to occur as can be seen from fig 2 the reaction set we present in table 1 is able to satisfactorily describe the ammonia degradation data over a range of conditions including different current densities and initial cl concentrations the model also provides an excellent description of the time varying concentrations of cl fig 3a and b and active chlorine fig 3c and d as well as by products chlorate fig 4c and d and nitrate fig 5a and b as illustrated table 1 the in situ generated active chlorine could react with ammonia and form monochloramine and then dichloramine with rate constants for these reactions of 3 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 102 m 1 s 1 respectively dichloramine on the one hand could decompose into noh which could combine with monochloramine and dichloramine resulting in formation of harmless nitrogen gas with rate constants of 8 3 103 m 1 s 1 and 2 8 104 m 1 s 1 respectively the oxidation of ammonium ions via reaction with cl is unimportant in our system because of i the much higher concentration of cl than nh4 and ii cl is generated at the anode to which positively charged nh4 ions cannot approach for these reasons the transformations of cl into active chlorine reaction 2 and 3 in table 1 are the dominant reactions while the reactions between cl and nh4 are of minor importance sensitivity analysis was undertaken in order to determine the importance of each of the various reactions table 1 in the kinetic model towards ammonia degradation during the electrolysis process as shown in fig s7 the oxidation of the chloride ion to the chloride radical reaction 1 is the only dominant reaction in the chlorine evolution reaction set while the transformation of nh4 into nh2cl reaction 7 and its subsequent decomposition into harmless n2 reaction 10 play relatively significant roles in relation to the ultimate degradation of ammonia compounds ammonia nitrogen removal from real wastewaters i e domestic sources landfills tanneries and urine using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaop has been examined previously by a number of investigators for example greater than 95 reductions in cod and nh4 n were observed within 6h on treating decentralized domestic wastewater influent nh4 n concentration of 30 40 mg l 1 cod concentration of 400 mg l 1 and cl concentration of 10 50 mm using an eaop cho et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the effluent from this eaop was of high quality and was considered suitable for nonpotable applications such as toilet flushing and it was proposed that the hydrogen gas generated at the cathode could be used as a back up energy source for the eaop system eaop have also been proposed as an effective alternative method for indirect ammonium oxidation from landfill leachate as the presence of high chloride concentrations are considered likely to facilitate this process anglada et al 2009 2011 cabeza et al 2007 pérez et al 2012b undesired chloride related by products i e chloramine chlorate and perchlorate were generated on electrolysis of real landfill leachate but by adjusting the parameters such as applied current density and influent chloride concentration the generation of chloramine and perchlorate could be effectively eliminated pérez et al 2012b while the energy consumption is substantially higher than that of conventional biological processes eaop provides a feasible approach for treating ammonia containing wastewaters with lower area requirement easier maintenance and remarkably reproducible behavior in addition no secondary waste biomass is generated consideration should be given to use of eaop as a final polishing step or as an alternative technology to biological nitrification with this latter option particularly attractive for chloride containing wastewaters future work will be undertaken to achieve better ammonium removal performance to further reduce the energy demand and to minimize toxic by products formation 4 3 implications of the model the mechanistically based kinetic model developed here provides an effective method to both interpret the experimental data and determine optimal conditions for ammonia oxidation with minimal generation of undesirable by products the ammonia degradation times predicted to be required using the kinetic model for complete ammonia removal for a range of initial cl and ammonia concentrations are shown in fig 7 for current densities of 3 ma cm 2 fig 7a and 5 ma cm 2 fig 7b utilizing fig 7 we can readily determine the appropriate operating time for ammonia removal for particular influent water compositions if the operating time is shorter than that deduced using the model ammonia is unlikely to be completely oxidized however if an operating time longer than that predicated is used all of the incoming ammonia will be degraded with residual active chlorine transferred to and consumed at the cathode eq 5 in table 1 this not only results in a sharp decrease in current efficiency and increase in energy consumption but also results in the formation of excessive by products fig 4c and d based on the experimental and modelling results a reaction mechanism for the electrochemical active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation process is proposed and shown in fig 8 the initial activation of cl to cl results in the formation of active chlorine the mono dichloramine generated from the reaction between active chlorine and ammonia undergoes rapid cleavage with the aid of a local excess of active chlorine with eventual transformation to nitrogen gas cl can be regenerated during the oxidation of ammonia with the reformation of cl facilitating the anodic production of active chlorine thereby extending the lifetime of cl and allowing cl to be employed in catalytic quantities only trace amounts of chlorine and nitrogen by products are produced in break point oxidation of ammonia when the active chlorine dose to ammonia nitrogen molar ratio cl n is lower than 1 active chlorine reacts with ammonia and converts it into chloramine with the concentration of total nitrogen remaining constant while in the transition region 1 cl n 1 6 decay of ammonia and chloramine starts to occur at cl n 1 6 complete removal of ammonia nitrogen to nitrogen gas is achieved in contrast during the electrochemical ammonia oxidation in the presence of cl removal of ammonia nitrogen is initiated at the very beginning of the electrolysis process this is attributed to the high localized concentration of in situ electro generated active chlorine with the molar ratio between ammonia nitrogen likely to be higher than 1 6 in the reaction zone close to the anode surface resulting in the rapid transformation of ammonia to chloramine followed by complete decomposition into nitrogen gas prior to diffusion into bulk solution it is therefore apparent that the electrochemical oxidation method has advantages over classical break point chlorination treatment in view of the more efficient use of in situ generated active chlorine the suppression of generation accumulation of nitrogen by products 5 conclusion we have demonstrated in this study that the active chlorine mediated electrochemical oxidation of ammonia can be an effective technology for ammonia removal the in situ generated active chlorine can be used to efficiently convert ammonia into harmless nitrogen gas with concentrations of by products i e chlorate nitrate and chloramine well below who guidelines a mechanistically based kinetic model has been developed that successfully describes the key underlying reactions occurring in the electrochemical ammonia oxidation system including active chlorine evolution ammonia decomposition and by product formation this model can be used to determine operating conditions current densities electrolysis times appropriate to particular feed water compositions of chloride and ammonia content that enable complete ammonia removal at optimal current efficiency and minimal by product formation these findings contribute to our

19307,ammonia nitrogen removal from wastewaters has gained much attention in recent decades as a result of the environmental problems associated with discharge of excessive amounts of this critical nutrient including eutrophication of receiving waters generation of offensive odours as a result of organism decay and complications associated with the disinfection of water supplies while removal via biological processes represents the principal means by which a reduction in dissolved nitrogen concentrations is achieved an electrochemical advanced oxidation process has been proposed as a potentially effective alternate means of removing ammonia from wastewaters with the removal associated with the in situ generation of oxidants particularly active chlorine at the anode here we describe the influence of key factors on the rate and extent of ammonia nitrogen removal in an electrochemical cell with a ti iro2 ruo2 anode and ti cathode the rate of ammonia removal was found to be dependent on both current density and initial chloride concentration with 95 ammonia removed from a 20 mm cl solution within approximately 40 min at a current density of 3 ma cm 2 resulting in an energy consumption of 126 kwh kg 1 nh4 n additionally we show that by products formation is effectively suppressed during the electrolysis process a mechanistically based kinetic model incorporating the key processes operating in the ammonia electro oxidation process was developed with particular attention given to i anodic generation of active chlorine and other chloride related by products ii active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation the results demonstrate that the electrochemical advanced oxidation process is a promising technology for treatment of ammonia containing wastewaters with advantages including simplicity safety and effectiveness graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical advanced oxidation process ammonia oxidation active chlorine kinetic model 1 introduction ammonia removal from wastewaters has attracted much attention in recent decades given the concerns associated with discharge of this critical nutrient with particular problems including eutrophication

zhang et al 2017 biological nitrification denitrification kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 and break point chlorination pressley et al 1972 have been applied extensively in the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters with each of these technologies exhibiting particular limitations for example air stripping consumes large amounts of energy and may result in air pollution problems when ammonia is transformed from aqueous to gas phase additionally this technology exhibits poor removal efficiency at low ammonia concentrations obaid ur rehman and beg 1990 biological methods require a series of reactors to achieve the range of functions required i e nitrification denitrification and solid liquid separation with the denitrification efficiency largely constrained by the biodegradable organic content in the wastewater ruiz et al 2003 breakpoint chlorination possesses risks related to the transport storage and the handling of active chlorine with challenges also associated with the optimization of the dosing of active chlorine in recent years an electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop has emerged as a promising approach to ammonia removal with advantages including minimal production of secondary waste amenability to automation versatility and safety li and liu 2009 pérez et al 2012a it has been reported that eaops are effective for the treatment of ammonia containing wastewaters from tanneries vlyssides and israilides 1997 power plants vanlangendonck et al 2005 municipal sources li and liu 2009 and landfills ye et al 2016 ammonia in either ammonium ion nh4 or deprotonated nh3 aq forms can be removed by i direct anodic oxidation and or ii indirect oxidation mediated by the electro generated active chlorine in the direct oxidation pathway nh3 is firstly adsorbed to the anode surface and subsequently decomposed principally to harmless nitrogen gas as a result of anodic electron transfer as shown in eq 1 kapałka et al 2010 kim et al 2006 zöllig et al 2015b 1 2 nh 3 6 oh n 2 6 h 2 o 6 e however direct ammonia oxidation requires the adjustment of wastewater ph to values greater than the pk a of the nh4 nh3 acid base pair i e ph 9 25 because nh4 cannot be oxidized directly at the anode zöllig et al 2015a furthermore the low reaction rate and high cost of the electrodes usually platinum restricts the practical application of this technology zöllig et al 2015b indirect oxidation which takes advantage of in situ generation of active chlorine at the anode to oxidize ammonia to nitrogen gas is more commonly used ji et al 2017 kapałka et al 2010 li and liu 2009 zhang et al 2018b this approach is much faster more efficient and cost effective than direct oxidation provided sufficient chloride ion 300 mg l 1 is present in the wastewater stream kim et al 2006 the overall reactions resulting in n2 production are as follows 2 2 cl cl 2 2 e 3 cl 2 h 2 o hocl h cl 4 2 nh 4 3 hocl n 2 3 h 2 o 5 h 3 cl limited insight regarding the precise mechanism and reaction kinetics of the active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation process is currently available traditionally it has been considered that the indirect electrochemical ammonia oxidation process eaop occurs via a mechanism similar to that of the intensively studied breakpoint chlorination that is ammonia first reacts with the active chlorine species hocl or ocl and stepwise generates chloramine species i e monochloramine dichloramine and trichloramine and finally nitrogen gas when the active chlorine ammonia mole ratio gradually reaches 1 5 mergerum et al 1978 qiang and adams 2004 however results of a number of electrochemical indirect ammonia oxidation studies indicate that the transformation of ammonia into nitrogen gas takes place at the very beginning of the electrolysis process and long before an active chlorine ammonia mole ratio of 1 5 is attained kim et al 2006 li and liu 2009 vanlangendonck et al 2005 these findings suggest that the mechanism of eaop differs from that of the conventional breakpoint chlorination process and as such requires clarification not surprisingly given the variety of faradaic reactions that may occur at both anode and cathode as well as the various solution phase reactions that may influence the rate and extent of ammonia oxidation there has been limited attempt to develop mechanistically based models of the overall process as such the objectives of this work are to i determine the effects of operating parameters such as initial chloride concentration and current density on the rate and extent of ammonia removal and ii development of a detailed mechanistically based kinetic model providing insight into the complex interactions that occur during electrochemically mediated ammonia oxidation processes that will assist in optimising implementation of the technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents all solutions were prepared using ultrapure 18 mω cm milli q water mq millipore analytical

calculations a range of factors influencing ammonia removal in the electrochemical advanced oxidation process was investigated including applied current density initial cl concentration initial ph ph0 and initial ammonia concentration during our experiments a dc power source was used to provide constant current densities ranged from 1 to 5 ma cm 2 for the electrochemical cell initial cl concentrations varied from 5 mm to 50 mm wastewater ph0 values were adjusted using either 1 m naoh or 1 m h2so4 each experiment was operated in batch mode and lasted for 90 min samples were taken from

corresponding to the rate expressions for the hypothesized reactions using the kinetic modelling software kintek explorer https kintekcorp com johnson et al 2009 qiu et al 2015 sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the kinetic modeling software kintecus http kintecus com by determining eigenvectors following previously published methods pham and waite 2008 vajda et al 1985 xing et al 2018 3 results 3 1 chlorine evolution the electrochemical system was first employed for examination of the evolution of chlorine species in the absence of ammonia at initial cl concentrations of 10 mm and 20 mm under three different current densities i e 1 3 and 5 ma cm 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the gradual loss of cl with a concomitant increase in active chlorine concentration indicated that cl was converted into active chlorine at the anode surface reactions 1 6 in table 1 higher current density and initial cl concentration resulted in faster active chlorine formation and higher steady state concentrations of active chlorine for example when an initial cl concentration of 20 mm was applied during the electrolysis steady state active chlorine concentrations of 1 4 1 5 2 7 2 9 and 3 3 3 5 mm were obtained at current densities of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 1 respectively a similar dependence was observed for the 10 mm cl case with active chlorine concentrations reaching 0 8 0 9 1 3 1 5 and 1 5 1 8 mm at current densities of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 1 respectively 3 2 active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation fig 2 demonstrates the effects of current density and cl concentration on the removal of ammonia during 90 min reaction it can be seen from these results that a higher current density leads to more rapid ammonia oxidation when a current density of 1 ma cm 2 was applied only 9 0 of nh4 n could be degraded in 40 min at an initial cl concentration of 10 mm the removal rates increased dramatically to 43 2 and 88 0 on increasing the current density to 3 and 5 ma cm 2 respectively a similar trend was observed for the 20 mm cl case while enhanced ammonia removal rates i e 17 8 87 5 and 97 7 were observed following 90 min operation at current densities of 1 5 ma cm 2 the variation of nh4 n concentrations for different initial cl concentrations is presented in fig s2 an initial cl concentration of 5 mm was too low to achieve an effective result when the cl concentration was higher than 10 mm the treatment was satisfactory with the near complete ammonia removal in 10 40 and 80 min in the solutions containing 50 20 and 10 mm cl respectively initial ph was observed to exert much less significant influence on ammonia removal than either current density or cl concentration in our electrochemical system as can be seen from fig s3 the degradation of ammonia exhibited little difference for various initial ph conditions ph0 3 6 and 9 bulk solution ph decreased during the electrolysis process to similar values whatever the initial ph fig s4 with this decrease a result of the abundant generation of h through both hypochlorite generation and indirect ammonia oxidation reactions reactions 3 and 4 and as a result of other side reactions such as water splitting fig s4 in addition the insignificant effect of initial ph on ammonia removal could be attributed to the fact that ammonia degradation mainly takes place close to the anode surface where the local ph is likely to be minimally affected by initial ph other investigators have also found that initial ph exerts little impact on ammonia degradation while current density and cl concentration appear to be the rate determining parameters li and liu 2009 xiao et al 2009 results showing the effects of initial ammonium concentrations and current density are provided in the supplementary information figs s5 and s6 fig 3 shows the temporal variation in cl and active chlorine concentrations during ammonia oxidation in all cases the concentration of cl was relatively stable until nh4 n was completely removed specifically obvious decrease in the cl concentration occurred following 70 and 40 min reaction at 3 and 5 ma cm 2 at an initial cl of 10 mm fig 3a while increase in the initial cl concentration to 20 mm resulted in a similar but earlier decrease in cl concentrations fig 3b in comparison when the current density was fixed at 1 ma cm 2 no significant change in chloride concentrations was observed with this result likely associated with the residual of ammonia in the solutions over the course of the experiments fig 2 active chlorine was also monitored as it plays a crucial role in ammonia removal through the aforementioned reactions eqs 2 4 initially a low concentration of active chlorine was detected due to its rapid consumption in the indirect ammonia oxidation process while it increased to a relatively high value following the complete degradation of ammonia fig 3c and d with the use of 10 mm cl active chlorine began to accumulate from 40 min to 70 min at current densities of 5to3 ma cm 2 respectively for a higher initial cl concentration of 20 mm the concentration of active chlorine increased earlier fig 3d it should be noted that the steady state concentrations of resultant active chlorine were quite comparable to the control experiments fig 1 in contrast the active chlorine concentrations were low throughout the whole electrolysis process at 1 ma cm 2 it is expected that the electrochemical ammonia oxidation process commences with the anodic oxidation of cl to active chlorine which subsequently reacts with ammonia resulting in the production of nitrogen gas eqs 2 4 meanwhile active chlorine is reduced to cl the dashed lines in fig 3 represent the time up until which the cl concentration does not change significantly and active chlorine does not accumulate as prior to these critical times it is reacting with ammonia that is still present as such cl can be regarded as a catalyst for electrochemical ammonia degradation up to these times however once the concentration of ammonia has decreased to zero the cl concentration begins to decrease with active chlorine thereafter accumulating in a manner similar to that shown in fig 1 3 3 by products generation the generation of hazardous by products such as chlorate and perchlorate is one main drawback of eaops applied to water wastewater containing chloride in our system chlorate was the only chloro species detected in all conditions with the concentrations of perchlorate well below the detection limit the formation of chlorate during the electrolysis of the solution without ammonia is shown in fig 4 a and b relatively low concentrations of chlorate were generated at the lowest current density applied 1 ma cm 2 not surprisingly chlorate concentration increased on increasing the applied current density to 5 ma cm 2 with 112 and 193 μm chlorate produced after 90 min electrolysis of solutions containing 10 mm and 20 mm cl nevertheless the final chlorate concentrations in this electrochemical cell were less than 1 of the initial cl concentration which is one order of magnitude lower than those observed in other similar electrochemical ammonia removal systems jung et al 2010 lin et al 2016 suggesting that by products generation was suppressed in our cell when ammonia was present in the electrolyte as shown in fig 4c and d the formation of chlorate was initially inhibited but increased rapidly once ammonia had been completely removed as a result of oxidation by electro generated chlorine with an initial cl concentration of 10 mm the chlorate concentration reached 0 5 1 2 and 1 9 μm at the time point when most ammonia was removed at current densities of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 2 respectively for a higher initial cl concentration fig 4d the chlorate generation was relatively faster with 1 2 2 0 and 2 4 μm formed at the end of the ammonia removal period for current densities respectively of 1 3 and 5 ma cm 2 these values are lower than the guideline 8 4 μm suggested by who who 2011 though once ammonia was exhausted the chlorate production exhibited a similar trend to the ammonia free cases fig 4a and b with the chlorate concentrations increasing to more than 100 μm following 90 min of reaction during the sequential oxidation of ammonia with in situ generated free chlorine most of the ammonia would be expected to convert to n2 reactions 7 10 in table 1 though a portion could transform into other nitrogenous by products such as nitrite and nitrate via reactions such as that shown in eq 7 7 nh 4 4 hocl no 3 h 2 o 6 h 4 cl in all experiments described here the concentration of nitrite was below the detection limit while a small quantity of nitrate was observed typical profiles of nitrate formation are shown in fig 5 with the production of nitrate commencing at the beginning of each experiment and the concentration increasing continuously until a plateau was reached at approximately the time at which ammonia was totally removed the generation rate of nitrate increased with increase in current density and initial cl concentration with the nitrate concentration reaching more than 100 μm when 5 ma cm 2 current density and 20 mm cl were used nevertheless this value is far below drinking water guideline values 806 μm who 2011 due to very limited information on steady state concentration of nitrite only an overall reaction reaction 12 in table 1 has been introduced to the kinetic model with a reasonable description of formation of nitrate achieved from the kinetic modelling of our experimental data fig 5 possible ph dependence of the rate of this reaction could account for the small differences observed between model and experimental values chloramine is potentially another nitrogen by product that could be formed during the active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation process in our experiments however minimal concentrations of chloramine 10 μm were detected after 90 min electrolysis with this accounting for less than 0 5 of the initial nh4 n concentration data not shown 3 4 current efficiency and energy consumption as mentioned earlier current efficiency and energy consumption are two key parameters used to evaluate the performance of electrochemical processes as illustrated in fig 6 a at a current density of 3 ma cm 2 the current efficiency ce was 2 9 for a 5 mm cl solution but increased sharply to 6 7 14 6 and 46 1 if higher cl concentrations of 10 20 and 50 mm were employed results presented in fig 6b indicate that the current efficiency first increased with increase in current density and then decreased with the maximum value achieved at 3 ma cm 2 in contrast energy consumption exhibits a negative relationship with cl concentration the electrochemical cell operated with initial cl concentration of 50 mm and current density of 3 ma cm 2 consumed the lowest energy 39 9 kwh kg n 1 of the various operating conditions examined with this value one order of magnitude lower than that reported in previous work yang et al 2016 fig 6c and d 4 discussion although the electrochemical ammonia oxidation process has now been described by a number of investigators understanding of the detailed mechanism of chlorine evolution and ammonia removal remains relatively preliminary to assist our understanding we here in develop a mechanistically based kinetic model to describe the anodic chlorine evolution and the resultant indirect ammonia oxidation processes the core components of the model include i active chlorine evolution during the electrolysis of nacl solution in the absence of ammonia and ii indirect ammonia oxidation by in situ generated active chlorine table 1 4 1 active chlorine evolution the in situ electro generated free chlorine is recognized to be the principal agent responsible for the oxidation of ammonia fig 1 shows the electrolytic generation of chlorine in the absence of ammonia with the observed behaviour following the classical volmer heyrovsky v h mechanism hansen et al 2010 trasatti 1987 according to this mechanism chloride ion is first adsorbed on the metal oxide electrode and is transformed into the chloride radical and in the process releases an electron reaction 1 in table 1 8 mo x cl k 1 mo x cl e in the following heyrovsky step the generated cl combines with the cl near the electrodes to produce chlorine reaction 2 in table 1 9 mo x cl cl k 2 mo x cl 2 e alternatively two cl radicals can combine and generate chlorine through the volmer tafel reaction reaction 3 in table 1 10 mo x cl mo x cl k 3 2 mo x cl 2 subsequently the hydrolysis of cl2 occurs reaction 4 in table 1 11 cl 2 h 2 o k 4 hocl h cl the hypochlorous acid generated at the anode can then be reduced to chloride ion at the cathode surface reaction 5 in table 1 12 hocl 2 e k 5 cl oh the main side reactions involve the further anodic oxidation of hocl ocl to chlorate reaction 6 in table 1 yang et al 2016 13 mo x 2 h 2 o hocl k 6 mo x clo 3 5 h 4 e here reaction 1 and reaction 5 in table 1 are the two key reactions that determine formation and decay of active chlorine while reaction 6 has an insignificant effect as the transformation of active chlorine to chlorate is negligible indeed the active chlorine concentration was controlled by the ratio of reactions 1 and 5 by maintaining the ratio of the rate constants for reactions 1 and 5 constant at each current density we can obtain the values of these rate constants on the basis of best fit to the experimental data for formation of active chlorine and decay of cl fig 1 as illustrated in table 1 the rate constants of reactions 1 and 5 k 1 and k 5 showed a strong dependency on current density for instance the rate constant of cl formation k 1 increased from 0 2 10 4 s 1 to 2 3 10 4 s 1 as the applied current density increased from 1 ma cm 2 to 5 ma cm 2 meanwhile the cathodic chlorine reduction reaction exhibited a rate constant ranging from 1 8 10 4 s 1 to 11 10 4 s 1 with its occurrence leading to the achievement of steady state concentrations of active chlorine fig 1 fig s7 shows that the values of these rate constants correlate linearly with the current densities r 2 0 98 the rate constant for reaction 6 was obtained by fitting the experimental data for chlorate generation fig 4a and b it should be noted that the rate and extent of generation of active chlorine is largely determined by the nature of the anode materials used in previous work linear sweep voltammetry was used to determine the active chlorine evolution potentials of the three most widely used eaop electrodes i e bdd ti iro2 ruo2 and ti iro2 ta2o5 of these electrodes ti iro2 ruo2 exhibited a lower chlorine evolution potential 1 10 v vs sce than ti iro2 ta2o5 1 11 v vs sce and bdd anodes 1 98 v vs sce with this comparison indicating that active chlorine production reaction 1 4 should be more facile at a ti iro2 ruo2 anode than at a bdd anode on application of the same voltage zhou et al 2011 moreover mixed metal oxides such as iro2 ruo2 have been found to increase the activity selectivity and stability of the anode with these materials providing active sites for radical cl formation and the redox transitions of ruo x v iv and iro x iv vi serving as electron sinks arikawa et al 1998 ferro and de battisti 2002 in our eaop system the rate constant for cl formation k 1 on the ti iro2 ruo2 anode used was more than one order larger than that obtained in previous similar work using a multilayer heterojunction sbsn coti ir anode yang et al 2016 chlorate appeared to be the only stable chloride related by product generated during the electrolysis process with perchlorate concentrations below detection limit as illustrated in table 1 the chlorate formation rate constant k 6 is two orders of magnitude lower than k 1 with this result in line with previous findings that the iro2 ruo2 anode is conducive to catalysing the generation of active chlorine but satisfyingly does little to facilitate the conversion of chlorine to by products such as chlorate and perchlorate bagastyo et al 2011 zöllig et al 2015c 4 2 chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation as the identity and rate constants for the key reactions of the traditional breakpoint chlorination process have been reasonably well established we combined the established ammonia reaction set reaction 7 12 in table 1 with the reactions describing the electrochemical active chlorine evolution reaction 1 6 in table 1 in order to fully elucidate the mechanism and kinetics of the electrochemically assisted ammonia oxidation processes it should be noted that reaction 5 in table 1 actually plays a minor role in the kinetic model of ammonia oxidation since the in situ generated active chlorine will be immediately consumed near the anode surface when ammonia is present in solution thereby rendering the cathodic chlorine reduction reaction reaction 5 in table 1 unlikely to occur as can be seen from fig 2 the reaction set we present in table 1 is able to satisfactorily describe the ammonia degradation data over a range of conditions including different current densities and initial cl concentrations the model also provides an excellent description of the time varying concentrations of cl fig 3a and b and active chlorine fig 3c and d as well as by products chlorate fig 4c and d and nitrate fig 5a and b as illustrated table 1 the in situ generated active chlorine could react with ammonia and form monochloramine and then dichloramine with rate constants for these reactions of 3 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 102 m 1 s 1 respectively dichloramine on the one hand could decompose into noh which could combine with monochloramine and dichloramine resulting in formation of harmless nitrogen gas with rate constants of 8 3 103 m 1 s 1 and 2 8 104 m 1 s 1 respectively the oxidation of ammonium ions via reaction with cl is unimportant in our system because of i the much higher concentration of cl than nh4 and ii cl is generated at the anode to which positively charged nh4 ions cannot approach for these reasons the transformations of cl into active chlorine reaction 2 and 3 in table 1 are the dominant reactions while the reactions between cl and nh4 are of minor importance sensitivity analysis was undertaken in order to determine the importance of each of the various reactions table 1 in the kinetic model towards ammonia degradation during the electrolysis process as shown in fig s7 the oxidation of the chloride ion to the chloride radical reaction 1 is the only dominant reaction in the chlorine evolution reaction set while the transformation of nh4 into nh2cl reaction 7 and its subsequent decomposition into harmless n2 reaction 10 play relatively significant roles in relation to the ultimate degradation of ammonia compounds ammonia nitrogen removal from real wastewaters i e domestic sources landfills tanneries and urine using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaop has been examined previously by a number of investigators for example greater than 95 reductions in cod and nh4 n were observed within 6h on treating decentralized domestic wastewater influent nh4 n concentration of 30 40 mg l 1 cod concentration of 400 mg l 1 and cl concentration of 10 50 mm using an eaop cho et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the effluent from this eaop was of high quality and was considered suitable for nonpotable applications such as toilet flushing and it was proposed that the hydrogen gas generated at the cathode could be used as a back up energy source for the eaop system eaop have also been proposed as an effective alternative method for indirect ammonium oxidation from landfill leachate as the presence of high chloride concentrations are considered likely to facilitate this process anglada et al 2009 2011 cabeza et al 2007 pérez et al 2012b undesired chloride related by products i e chloramine chlorate and perchlorate were generated on electrolysis of real landfill leachate but by adjusting the parameters such as applied current density and influent chloride concentration the generation of chloramine and perchlorate could be effectively eliminated pérez et al 2012b while the energy consumption is substantially higher than that of conventional biological processes eaop provides a feasible approach for treating ammonia containing wastewaters with lower area requirement easier maintenance and remarkably reproducible behavior in addition no secondary waste biomass is generated consideration should be given to use of eaop as a final polishing step or as an alternative technology to biological nitrification with this latter option particularly attractive for chloride containing wastewaters future work will be undertaken to achieve better ammonium removal performance to further reduce the energy demand and to minimize toxic by products formation 4 3 implications of the model the mechanistically based kinetic model developed here provides an effective method to both interpret the experimental data and determine optimal conditions for ammonia oxidation with minimal generation of undesirable by products the ammonia degradation times predicted to be required using the kinetic model for complete ammonia removal for a range of initial cl and ammonia concentrations are shown in fig 7 for current densities of 3 ma cm 2 fig 7a and 5 ma cm 2 fig 7b utilizing fig 7 we can readily determine the appropriate operating time for ammonia removal for particular influent water compositions if the operating time is shorter than that deduced using the model ammonia is unlikely to be completely oxidized however if an operating time longer than that predicated is used all of the incoming ammonia will be degraded with residual active chlorine transferred to and consumed at the cathode eq 5 in table 1 this not only results in a sharp decrease in current efficiency and increase in energy consumption but also results in the formation of excessive by products fig 4c and d based on the experimental and modelling results a reaction mechanism for the electrochemical active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation process is proposed and shown in fig 8 the initial activation of cl to cl results in the formation of active chlorine the mono dichloramine generated from the reaction between active chlorine and ammonia undergoes rapid cleavage with the aid of a local excess of active chlorine with eventual transformation to nitrogen gas cl can be regenerated during the oxidation of ammonia with the reformation of cl facilitating the anodic production of active chlorine thereby extending the lifetime of cl and allowing cl to be employed in catalytic quantities only trace amounts of chlorine and nitrogen by products are produced in break point oxidation of ammonia when the active chlorine dose to ammonia nitrogen molar ratio cl n is lower than 1 active chlorine reacts with ammonia and converts it into chloramine with the concentration of total nitrogen remaining constant while in the transition region 1 cl n 1 6 decay of ammonia and chloramine starts to occur at cl n 1 6 complete removal of ammonia nitrogen to nitrogen gas is achieved in contrast during the electrochemical ammonia oxidation in the presence of cl removal of ammonia nitrogen is initiated at the very beginning of the electrolysis process this is attributed to the high localized concentration of in situ electro generated active chlorine with the molar ratio between ammonia nitrogen likely to be higher than 1 6 in the reaction zone close to the anode surface resulting in the rapid transformation of ammonia to chloramine followed by complete decomposition into nitrogen gas prior to diffusion into bulk solution it is therefore apparent that the electrochemical oxidation method has advantages over classical break point chlorination treatment in view of the more efficient use of in situ generated active chlorine the suppression of generation accumulation of nitrogen by products 5 conclusion we have demonstrated in this study that the active chlorine mediated electrochemical oxidation of ammonia can be an effective technology for ammonia removal the in situ generated active chlorine can be used to efficiently convert ammonia into harmless nitrogen gas with concentrations of by products i e chlorate nitrate and chloramine well below who guidelines a mechanistically based kinetic model has been developed that successfully describes the key underlying reactions occurring in the electrochemical ammonia oxidation system including active chlorine evolution ammonia decomposition and by product formation this model can be used to determine operating conditions current densities electrolysis times appropriate to particular feed water compositions of chloride and ammonia content that enable complete ammonia removal at optimal current efficiency and minimal by product formation these findings contribute to our fundamental understanding of the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia and provide guidance with regard to effective implementation and optimization of this process acknowledgement we gratefully

19308,the performances of an equilibrium and a kinetic passive sampler for monitoring a range of organic contaminants log kow from 0 03 to 6 26 were evaluated in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant the receiving river saar as well as the river mosel in germany the polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis and a new mixed polymer sampler mps were selected as kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers respectively concentrations were described in terms of a time weighted average concentration ctwa from the pocis measurements and as an equilibrium concentration from the mps cequil mps and pocis membrane cequil pes analyses twenty seven compounds could be detected including eight priority substances of the eu water framework directive both sampler types detected a similar range of compounds in the low ng l to μg l range with a high proportion of pharmaceuticals being detected at all sampling sites to account for uncertainty in the pocis sampling rates a range in ctwa was estimated by applying low and high sampling rates for the compounds that were detected in the pocis this range was within a factor of 3 5 interestingly the mps extracts showed lower ionisation artefacts than the pocis extracts during the lc ms ms analysis finally total water concentrations ctotal were estimated from the dissolved concentrations literature organic carbon partition coefficients koc and the total organic carbon levels measured in the rivers for the compounds in this study negligible differences between ctotal and the passive sampler derived dissolved concentrations were found with a maximum difference of 15 for diclofenac overall this study demonstrated that the parallel application of kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers can improve the description of water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords passive sampling pocis mixed polymer sampler chemical profile surface water ctotal 1 introduction increased attention on organic contaminants in aquatic environments and their possible negative effects has triggered research into developing tools for the monitoring of water quality there is even a legislative demand for the monitoring of aquatic organic contaminants such as in the european union water framework directive eu wfd the united states clean water act us cwa or the oslo paris convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north east atlantic ospar improvements in analytical methods and instrumentation have resulted in high sensitivity and selectivity for the determination of an increasingly wide range of trace organic contaminants in aquatic environments nevertheless the initial sampling still remains a challenging step ort et al 2010 conventional sampling techniques such as grab sampling using containers are practical to apply but limited to a specific time and place loos 2012 in addition the relatively small sample volumes may lead to detection issues the latter might be overcome by using large volume samplers that can sample up to several hundred liters schulze et al 2017 flow proportional samplers take more representative samples yet still often only provide a limited volume and also require a power source ort et al 2010 finally the above sampling approaches often require a filtering or centrifugation step prior to analysis which can be associated with artefacts such as sorption to the filters or to third phases such as dissolved organic matter andrade eiroa et al 2016 such issues challenge a comprehensive assessment of water quality at the spatial and temporal scales here passive sampling is a promising tool with a number of advantages in situ application targeting a wide range of compounds over a prolonged period providing their bioavailable dissolved concentrations and selective concentration of the analytes on the sorbent to give clean samples to simplify the analysis vrana et al 2005 in passive sampling the contaminants partition to the sampler material via diffusion as driven by the differences in chemical potential between the environmental and sampler phases górecki and namieśnik 2002 the partitioned amount of chemical initially increases with time i e kinetic sampling mode until the sampler and surrounding medium reach an equilibrium such that the sampler concentrations remain constant i e equilibrium sampling mode both sampling modes have been applied for investigating contaminant levels in aquatic environments in kinetic mode the environmental dissolved concentration is estimated using a compound and sampler specific sampling rate determined in laboratory calibration experiments or via in situ calibration sampling in the kinetic uptake regime provides a time weighted average concentration ctwa which gives a longer term description of water quality vrana et al 2005 alvarez et al 2004 in equilibrium mode the sampler concentration is calibrated back to the environmental dissolved concentration using a compound and sampler specific equilibrium partition coefficient if the response time of the passive sampler is sufficiently fast compared to changes in the ambient concentrations then the equilibrium sampling concentrations cequil can depict the dissolved levels in the period prior to sampler recovery hawker 2010 how fast a passive sampler reaches equilibrium depends on the sampler format the contaminant properties as well as environmental conditions such as the water flow rate or temperature a further application of equilibrium passive sampling is for the initial sampling of environmental mixtures for their subsequent toxicity testing creusot et al 2014 emelogu et al 2013 however interfacing passive sampling with toxicity testing requires properly reproducing the bioavailable field mixture profile in the test which can only be achieved by combining equilibrium passive sampling with passive dosing jahnke et al 2017 therefore this requires suitable equilibrium passive samplers for both polar and non polar aquatic contaminants in this study kinetic and equilibrium passive sampling were compared for the monitoring of aquatic contaminants in german rivers the widely used polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis was selected as a representative kinetic passive sampler as an equilibrium passive sampler a new monophasic mixed polymer sampler mps was used the mps consists of oasis hlb sorbent the receiving phase of the pocis embedded in a polydimethylsiloxane pdms silicone matrix this has a better affinity for polar compounds compared to pdms alone jeong et al 2018 the two passive sampler formats were deployed over 35 days at five sampling sites along the rivers saar and mosel as well as in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharging into the river saar the chemical profiles accumulated in the samplers were converted into either ctwa or cequil to describe the surface water contaminant levels the specific aims of this study were i to compare the performance of the two passive sampler types with regards to their practicality and sampling characteristics ii to determine the environmental dissolved concentrations either as ctwa or cequil of a range of organic contaminants in two rivers and the outflow of the wwtp and iii to estimate total water concentrations ctotal from the passive sampling measurements to investigate its potential for meeting regulatory requirements which are based on ctotal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals target compounds were selected based on their detection frequency in surface waters loos

steinheim germany dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany or toronto research chemicals toronto canada stock solutions for each target analyte were prepared in methanol at a nominal concentration of 1 mg ml and stored at 20 c solvents including lc ms grade methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from vwr international gmbh darmstadt germany oasis hlb sorbent particle size 30 μm was purchased from waters ma usa polyethersulfone pes membranes 90 mm diameter 0 1 μm pore size from pall corporation mi usa and silastic medical adhesive silicone type a from dow corning mi usa for assembling the pocis stainless steel washers were bought from wegertseder gmbh ortenburg germany all glassware and materials were cleaned in a dishwasher followed by rinsing with methanol prior to use 2 2 preparation of the passive samplers 2 2 1 mps a mixed polymer sampler mps was produced in house by combining pdms and oasis hlb jeong et al 2018 in brief pdms was dissolved in hexane and this solution cured in a petri dish at 4 c overnight to give a thin layer of pdms a suspension of oasis hlb and pdms in a mixed solvent of hexane and ethanol 1 1 v v was then added and allowed to cure finally a top layer of pdms was added before deployment the mps were cleaned by soaking twice in methanol and then twice in milli q water for 24 h each time details on the configuration of the mps are provided in table s2 the possibility of using performance reference compounds prcs with the mps was also tested a prc stock solution was prepared containing the 12 deuterated compounds at concentrations of around 1 μg ml one ml of this prc stock was added per mps contained in separate beakers the beakers were tightly closed and stored at room temperature in the dark for 17 days to give sufficient time for the prcs to distribute within the polymer after removing the mps 1 ml of methanol was added to rinse the beaker walls and this was analysed to calculate the mass of each compound loaded per mps 2 2 2 pocis pes membranes were pre conditioned by soaking in 10 ml of methanol overnight followed by storage in milli q water oasis hlb sorbent was prepared by shaking in methanol and pouring off the overlying methanol after repeating the cleaning procedure three times the oasis hlb was dried in a fume hood overnight the pocis was constructed by enclosing 218 74 1 82 mg of oasis hlb powder between two pes membranes and clamping these between two cleaned steel washers table s2 the amount of oasis hlb added was calculated following the sorbent to surface area ratio of 180 cm2 g from alvarez et al 2004 the assembled pocis were covered in the solvent rinsed aluminum foil until field deployment 2 3 laboratory calibration of passive samplers sampling rates rs and equilibrium passive sampler water partition coefficients ksw were available from a separate laboratory calibration experiment full details available in jeong et al 2018 and summarized in the si in short bottles containing 2 l of milli q water adjusted to ph 7 and with nominal concentrations of the target compounds of 20 μg l were prepared uptake of the target compounds in the passive samplers was measured over 512 h sampling rates for 34 compounds were determined under stirred and static conditions to reflect the influence of extremes in hydrodynamic conditions table s5 equilibrium partition coefficients of each passive sampler type were also determined table s5 2 4 field deployment passive samplers were deployed from 18 may to 22 june 2015 in the effluent from the brebach wwtp located in saarbrücken wwtp in fig 1 the receiving river saar saar1 saar2 and saar3 and in the river mosel adjacent to the inflow of the river saar the river saar is the longest and biggest tributary of the river mosel physicochemical parameters of the surface water including surface water temperature 17 22 1 49 c ph 7 80 0 16 and total organic carbon concentration toc 4 07 0 46 mg toc l were measured in situ at fortnightly or monthly intervals at two stations locations are marked on fig 1 at each sampling site duplicate pocis and triplicate or quadruplicate mps were attached to a wire cage and deployed for 35 days the mps were enclosed in copper mesh envelopes to limit biofouling field blank passive samplers triplicate for pocis and quadruplicate for mps were included to detect background contamination during the transportation deployment and recovery of the passive samplers 2 5 sampler extraction after the 35 day deployment all passive samplers were recovered immediately after collection the sampler surfaces were wiped with lab tissue enclosed in aluminum foil and stored at 20 c until extraction and analysis the pocis were separated into the pes membranes and oasis hlb sorbent by trapping the latter on a pre cleaned glass fiber filter gf f 47 mm diameter via rinsing the membranes with milli q water each was transferred to separate 20 ml headspace vials the mps were removed from their copper mesh envelope and carefully wiped with lab tissue to remove any organic residue from the sampler surface before placing in 20 ml headspace vials the pes membrane oasis hlb sorbent mps were separately extracted in their storage vials by adding 10 ml of methanol and shaking on the vertical rotator for 48 h after 48 h the methanol extracts were filtered with a 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filter fitted to a glass syringe and blown down to ca 1 ml under a gentle n2 stream using a turbovap lv biotage uppsala sweden this extraction procedure was repeated twice more to give a final volume of approximately 3 ml the exact volume of the combined methanol extracts was calculated by weight to make sure that all compounds had been extracted a fourth extraction was performed as above and the extracted concentrations analysed separately 2 6 lc ms ms analysis an hplc system 1290 infinity agilent technologies coupled to a 6460 qqq mass spectrophotometer agilent technologies equipped with a jet stream electrospray ionisation esi source was used for analysis of the 44 compounds analytical details are available in jeong et al 2017 briefly a gradient of milli q water containing 5 mm ammonium acetate and 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile was used to separate the target analytes on an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 rapid resolution high definition rrhd column 1 8 μm 2 1 mm 50 mm equipped with an uhplc guard column 1 8 μm 2 1 mm 5 mm dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mrm employing two transitions from a single precursor ion to two product ions was used in either positive or negative ionisation mode depending on the analyte contaminant levels in the passive samplers from the various the sampling sites and the remaining prcs in recovered mps were analysed in separate sequences quantification of the target analytes was done using the quantitative and qualitative modules of the masshunter workstation software version b 06 00 2 7 theoretical background the two passive samplers employed in this study have different sampling modes pocis is a kinetic sampler with a long linear uptake period for many compounds a time weighted average concentration of a contaminant in water ctwa ng l can be calculated from the measured sampler concentrations as follows booij et al 2007 1 c twa n s k sw m s 1 e x p r s t k sw m s where ns is the contaminant mass extracted from the passive sampler ng rs the compound specific sampling rate l day t the sampling period day ksw the sampler water partition coefficient l kg and ms the sampler mass kg when the compound specific uptake halftime t1 2 day is over 30 days which is assumed to be relatively long considering the sampling period i e 35 days in this study the partitioning of the analytes to the pocis remains in the linear uptake regime therefore equation 1 can be simplified to 2 c twa n s r s t one challenge in the interpretation of pocis data is the choice of the correct sampling rate rs this depends greatly on environmental conditions and in particular turbulence which is difficult to extrapolate from laboratory calibrations into the field therefore to derive upper and lower bounds in ctwa two sampling rates derived from calibration experiments and determined under strongly stirred and static condition were applied to cover the likely range of turbulences in the field in contrast a laboratory calibration experiment demonstrated that uptake halftimes of the target compounds in the mps were less than 12 days and this sampler is an equilibrium sampler the environmental dissolved concentration cequil ng l were derived as follows 3 c equil n s k sw m s the sampling rates and equilibrium partition coefficient values are available in si table s5 to further describe the kinetic characteristics of the mps halftimes and response times in the field were calculated from dissipation of the prcs as follows huckins et al 2002 4 c s c s 0 e x p k e t 5 t 1 2 ln 2 k e where cs is the prc concentration remaining in the mps at sampler recovery ng kg cs 0 the loaded prc concentration before the sampler deployment ng kg k e the elimination rate 1 day and t1 2 is the halftime days the sampler response time was then estimated from the reciprocal of k e 2 8 determination of ctotal from the passive sampling measurements in this study ctotal was calculated using the freely dissolved concentrations obtained from the passive sampling measurements cfree ctotal is the sum of the passive sampler derived values of cfree and the concentrations associated with the organic carbon present in the water csorbed csorbed was calculated using the following equation 6 c sorbed toc k oc c free where toc is the toc concentration kg toc l koc the organic carbon oc partition coefficient l water kg oc toc was measured by online photometers either every two weeks or monthly at two locations see fig 1 landesamt für umwelt und arbeitsschutz 2015 koc of the contaminants were predicted using poly parameter linear free energy relationships pp lfers obtained from the ufz lser database v 3 1 ulrich et al 2017 this calculation is based on three assumptions firstly that sorbed compounds were predominantly associated with particulate organic carbon in the water secondly the sampling area had homogenous and constant total organic carbon concentrations during the sampling period lastly that the koc values from the ufz database which are based on soil organic carbon are similar to those in surface water these are further discussed below 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of analytical procedure contaminant concentrations in the methanol extracts of the different samplers were determined using lc ms ms as described elsewhere jeong et al 2017 fifteen calibration standards ranging from 0 05 to 800 00 μg l were analysed at the beginning and the end of each sequence it was confirmed that there was no contamination of the pocis or mps before sampler deployment by analyzing the field blank samplers procedural blanks consisting of milli q water or methanol were analysed after every 5 6 samples to check carry over during the sequence significant peaks were only found for dehp in these blanks and it was not included in the further data treatment due to low analytical sensitivities six compounds were excluded from the further discussion i e bifenox clopyralid dichlorvos ibuprofen fluroxypyr and tribenuron methyl for the remaining 37 compounds a quadratic relationship between peak area and concentration was established with correlation coefficients r2 all above 0 95 in addition ilod and iloq were calculated and are available in a previous publication jeong et al 2017 as check standards low level calibration standards i e 0 40 0 78 1 56 μg l were routinely analysed at least every 15 samples and the relative standard deviations were less than 10 for most compounds in summary the analysis was accurate and sensitive enough to quantify 37 target analytes in the field samples ionisation suppression or enhancement is a major challenge in the electrospray ionisation source in lc ms ms analyses petrović et al 2005 therefore an evaluation of the matrix effects of environment samples is critical because this can lead to inaccurate quantification considering the fact that ionisation effects are compound sampler and site specific ionisation factors were determined for all compound sampler sample combinations using a simplified standard addition method details available in jeong et al 2018 in short duplicate aliquots of each extract were analysed in parallel one aliquot consisted of the passive sampler extract whereas the second was additionally spiked with 20 ng of each compound taking into account the range of field concentrations ionisation factors were calculated from the signal difference between the two aliquots ionisation effects of the 37 compounds have been presented in order of increasing retention times in figure s1 ionisation suppression is indicated by an ionisation factor of less than 1 and ionisation enhancement by a factor of more than 1 ionisation factors ranged by a factor of 24 from 0 08 for flufenacet up to 1 91 for atenolol both measured in wwtp effluent samples for the mps extracts by a factor of 70 from 0 05 for metoprolol mosel site up to 3 47 for thifensulfuron methyl saar1 site for the pes membrane extracts and by a factor of 42 from 0 06 for flufenacet saar2 site up to 2 54 for thifensulfuron methyl mosel site for the oasis hlb extracts although passive sampling is considered to be robust against matrix effects lissalde et al 2011 significant ionisation effects were observed for most of the target compounds sampler types as well as between samples from different sites for example chlorpyrifos did not give a peak in any of the samples despite no ionisation effects being observed in field blank samplers average ionisation factor of 0 97 this results in uncertainty as to whether it is absent from the river or whether it is present but the measurements are compromised by high ionisation suppression there was no clear relationship between ionisation factors and compound properties sampler configuration or different sampling sites for any given compound mps ionisation factors were rather consistent regardless of the sampling site this may be related to the fact that the mps were relatively clean after the 35 day deployment this might be due to the copper mesh limiting biofouling another explanation could be that the silicone surface of the sampler is less suitable for biofilm growth and or sorption of organic matter for pocis the ionisation factors from the pes membrane extracts were more variable than those from the oasis hlb with the biofouling seen on the membranes likely one of the main reasons organic matter adhering on the membranes was not easily removed especially compared to the mps surface in constrast the oasis hlb was not directly exposed to the environment and thus more protected from biofilm growth the disparate ionisation responses between the pes and oasis hlb extracts imply that the oasis hlb sorbent and pes membrane should always be extracted and analysed separately for an accurate quantification of pocis sorbed compounds to lower matrix effects a non damaging washing protocol for pes membranes has been developed by guibal et al 2015 in this study the calculated dissolved concentrations have been corrected using each compound sampler sample specific ionisation factor 3 2 quantitation of the surface water dissolved concentrations during the 35 days sampling period noticeable sorbent loss was found in only one pocis from saar2 and this was therefore not analysed apart from this all passive samplers could be recovered and were analysed to derive the dissolved concentrations at the five sampling sites for the pocis contaminant levels could be described using both a ctwa and a cequil pes from the mps measurements these were described using a cequil mps field blank pocis and mps measurements did not reveal any airborne contamination twenty seven out of the 37 analysed compounds were detected using at least one of the two passive sampler formats and the ctwa or cequil of each determined fig 2 and s2 table s7 the detected compounds covered a broad range of log kow from 0 06 atenolol up to 6 26 clotrimazole seventeen compounds were detected at all sampling sites with the mps whereas 22 compounds were found at all sites by pocis atenolol and mcpa were only detected using pocis sulfamethoxazole and gemfibrozil were only observed using mps in the wwtp effluent but were detected using pocis at the other sampling sites alachlor was consistently detected by the mps at all sampling sites but measured by pocis at only one sampling site therefore there was a large overlap in the range of compounds detected using either mps or pocis and both sampler types are complementary the fungicides econazole ketoconazole and miconazole were measured in the sampler extracts but rs and ksw are not available and their dissolved field concentrations could not be determined figure s3 table s8 note that aqueous ph in the laboratory calibration experiment ph 7 and at the sampling sites ph 7 8 was different this may affect uptake rates and partition coefficients to the pocis and the mps especially for ionisable compounds however such effects are likely small since over this ph range sulfamethoxazole remains predomintaly anioic 87 at ph 7 and 98 at ph 7 8 whereas clotrimazole always remains mainly neutral 85 at ph 7 and 98 at ph 7 8 3 2 1 oasis hlb of pocis measurements ctwa uncertainty in rs has been underlined as one of the main limitations of pocis miège et al 2012 to date various calibration methods including in silico and prc approaches have been attempted for in situ calibration miller et al 2016 carpinteiro et al 2016 however available rs values remain variable which challenges quantitation of the environmental dissolved concentrations note that for pocis the prc approach was not used in this study and the true in situ impact of environmental parameters such as flow rate and temperature on rs remains a source of uncertainty for the pocis two ctwa values were calculated using the amounts accumulated on the oasis hlb in conjunction with the lowest representing static conditions and highest representing highly turbulent conditions rs from a laboratory calibration experiment the impact of mixing on rs was below a factor of 9 for the complete set of target analytes and the difference between the low and high ctwa for the compounds that were actually measured in this study ranged from only 1 2 for 2 4 d up to 3 5 for atrazine see fig 2 and s2 the two values in ctwa thus represent upper and lower bounds that might be expected in the field and imply that the true dissolved concentrations can be estimated to within a factor of 3 5 regardless of extremes in hydrodynamic conditions for some compounds accumulating in the pocis the uptake halftimes obtained from the calibration experiment were relatively short even under the static conditions these included atenolol carbendazim clotrimazole mcpa and sulfamethoxazole which all had halftimes of less than 15 days this implies that during the 35 day deployment the pocis was no longer acting as a kinetic but rather as an equilibrium sampler for these compounds therefore their dissolved concentrations were calculated from the accumulated amounts using the equilibrium partition coefficients from jeong et al 2018 and equation 3 figure s2 and table s7 to avoid confusion these have still been termed ctwa to make clear they are derived from the pocis measurements but have been marked with an asterisk ctwa ranged from 0 19 ng l for napropamid saar3 up to 37 84 μg l for metoprolol wwtp the low dissolved concentrations that could be detected using pocis underline its suitability for sampling trace levels of aquatic contaminants in general the highest ctwa values of over 1 μg l were observed for four pharmaceuticals atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac and metoprolol as well as pentachlorophenol pcp for example the lower ctwa estimate for diclofenac was 36 μg l and 38 μg l for metropolol both in the wwtp effluent although markedly higher concentrations in the wwtp effluents were determined for the pharmaceuticals and a few compounds such as pcp for the remaining compounds the concentrations determined in the wwtp effluent were similar or only marginally higher than the river levels bearing in mind that these effluents are diluted by the river water this has repercussions as to the magnitude of the wwtp as a contributory source of these compounds to the saar river furthermore ctwa were relatively similar along the saar and mosel river sites 3 2 2 pes membrane of pocis measurements cequil pes previous studies have reported that sorption to the pocis membranes is considerable for some compounds vermeirssen et al 2012 and that the pes membranes can themselves be used as passive samplers posada ureta et al 2017 therefore in addition to ctwa cequil pes values were calculated using the measured pes concentrations and the kpesw determined in the calibration experiment cequil pes could be determined for the 21 compounds with both a quantifiable signal and a value of kpesw note that cequil pes could be calculated even for compounds with low kpesw values such as 2 4 d cybutryne flufenacet and orysastrobin see table s5 cequil pes ranged from 2 12 ng l napropamid at saar3 to 10 60 μg l diclofenac at wwtp when compared with the ctwa estimates the values of cequil pes were either similar or at least in the same range for most compounds and sampling sites see fig 2 and s1 exceptionally large differences were found for 2 4 d and clotrimazole where cequil pes were up to 64 and 34 times higher than the respective ctwa values one explanation could be that the equilibrium sampling nature of the pes membranes means that a peak in concentrations prior to the samples being recovered was picked up whereas this would only be reflected in a slightly higher ctwa however this is unlikely due to this difference in cequil pes not being reflected in the corresponding cequil mps which was measured using another equilibrium sampler for the remaining compounds the differences were less than a factor of 20 see table s7 although some compounds consistently had lower cequil pes values e g atrazine whereas others had cequil pes higher values e g cybutryne the basic assumption behind the cequil pes calculation is that the pes membrane reaches equilibrium however this may not be valid for pocis during kinetic uptake given that partitioning within the sampler is still ongoing and lag effects due to sorption by the pes membrane should be considered jeong et al 2018 vermeirssen et al 2012 this is further complicated when the concentrations in the surrounding water fluctuate as the overall equilibrium status is continuously shifted consequently the accumulated amount of analyte is not simply determined by the environmental dissolved concentration and kpesw but an intricate combination of changing environmental dissolved concentrations the relative affinity of the pes and oasis hlb components lag effects due to the pes membranes and environmental parameters 3 2 3 mps measurements cequil mps the mps was considered to act as an equilibrium sampler jeong et al 2018 which is supported by two aspects firstly the uptake halftimes obtained from the calibration experiment were less than 15 days for all compounds except for diclofenac and metoprolol 45 8 and 18 0 days respectively secondly to better understand the role of the in situ conditions on the sampler uptake prcs were loaded onto the mps before deployment analysis of the prc levels remaining after sampler recovery allowed elimination constants k e and the associated halftimes t1 2 to be calculated for the mps deployed at each of the sites table s3 all loaded deuterated compounds were significantly dissipated by over 90 after the 35 days regardless of their hydrophobicity or other physicochemical properties log d of prcs ranged from 2 14 for atenolol to 4 30 for chlorfenvinphos such dissipation rates resulted in t1 2 values that were mostly in the 3 5 day range and all lower than 8 days table s3 even the in situ halftimes of diclofenac and metoprolol were less than 8 days from these prc dissipation measurements the corresponding response times calculated after huckins et al 1993 ranged from 4 1 days for metoprolol at saar3 to 11 2 days for diclofenac at saar2 table s4 this confirms the results of the calibration experiment and indicates that the mps were likely close to equilibrium after their deployment note also that there was no lag effect due to the absence of membranes in the mps application of equilibrium passive samplers requires that stable ambient concentrations are maintained for longer periods than the corresponding response time of the sampler mayer et al 2003 however as discussed in hawker 2010 when water concentrations fluctuate significantly over shorter time scales then the mps would not reach a true partitioning equilibrium although this situation is unlikely to have occured for all of the sampled compounds due to their numerous input sources and the large water volumes of the river acting as a buffer ht it could nevertheless have been an issue for acute inputs e g illegal discharges accidents investigating this would require a high resolution grab sampling campaign which although beyond the scope of this study is a worthwhile research topic for the future therefore the mps was considered to function as an equilibrium passive sampler and equation 3 was used to derive cequil mps cequil mps values ranged from 0 93 ng l napropamid at saar1 to 7 61 μg l terbutryn at mosel these are in the similar range as the corresponding ctwa and cequil pes values and again the low dissolved concentrations that could be detected attest to passive sampling as a sensitive sampling approach the high loads of some pharmaceuticals that were detected by pocis were not so well detected by mps e g atenolol and sulfamethoxazole in figure s2 despite the same sorbent used as the receiving phase i e oasis hlb the lack of detection by the mps can perhaps be explained by the fact that overall the kmps is lower than kpocis and they were thus less concentrated in the sampler jeong et al 2018 nevertheless the mps still detected a similar range of organic contaminants as the pocis this means they can be deployed in parallel as kinetic and equilibrium samplers to better monitor short term changes in concentrations and or for the initial sampling of environmental mixtures for toxicity testing the mps and pes membranes of the pocis both functioned as equilibrium passive samplers and for the majority of compounds comparable cequil values were observed e g see atrazine cybutryne diuron and isoproturon in fig 2 where differences were within a factor of 2 3 this is encouraging given that although both operate in the equilibrium regime they are completely different formats made of different materials and use independently determined values to describe their partitioning affinity for a few compounds such as terbutryn cequil mps higher at all sites or 2 4 d cequil mps lower at all river sites differences over a factor of 100 were observed the exact reasons are unclear but could be due to differences in the sampler equilibration halftimes meaning that they sample over different time frames the pes membrane not reaching full equilibrium see discussion above or uncertainty in the equilibrium partitioning coefficients 3 3 chemical profile absolute proportions of the different compound classes e g pharmaceuticals pesticides etc are dependent on the list of target analytes however since these were the same for all sampling sites a comparison of the contribution of different classes allows inferences to be made as to the likely sources of contamination to a particular site indeed chemical profiles between the saar and mosel rivers were different which is probably related to differences in the watershed size land use and the amount of discharge the target analytes have been divided into pharmaceuticals and pesticides and the latter further classified as herbicides fungicides algicides and insecticide table s1 a preponderance of pharmaceuticals was found indicating that wwtp remains a major input pathway of these compounds to the rivers fig 3 the percentage of ctwa of pharmaceuticals to the total ctwa i e the sum of ctwa of all analytes for each sample ranged from 72 50 to 88 19 apart from the mosel site where they only contributed 6 37 the percentage of cequil mps of pharmaceuticals to the total cequil mps was similarly dominant and ranged from 43 35 to 71 51 the passive sampler derived concentrations from this study fall within or at the higher end of the range reported in other studies in europe loos et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 meyer et al 2016 high pharmaceutical loads likely result from their high prescription amounts combined with their low removal rate during wastewater treatment meyer et al 2016 al aukidy et al 2012 ter laak et al 2010 among the pharmaceuticals both carbamazepine ctwa 205 11 ng l to 533 51 ng l and metoprolol ctwa 210 96 ng l to 945 49 ng l were particularly abundant in river water in fact carbamazepine has been adopted as an anthropogenic marker to indicate a severe anthropogenic burden on sampling sites kahle et al 2009 overall the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the receiving rivers implies the need for additional treatment steps to ensure their removal combined with further studies regarding the potential impact of wwtp in the contamination of the receiving waters zenker et al 2014 in general the concentrations and contributions of the pesticides as a group either as ctwa or cequil were relatively constant across all river sites and in good agreement with reported values in previous studies moschet et al 2015 poulier et al 2015 the percentage of ctwa of the pesticides as a group to the total ctwa ranged from 11 81 to 27 50 the percentage of cequil mps to the total cequil mps ranged from 28 49 to 56 65 with the exception of the cequil mps of 93 63 found for the mosel site fig 3 the latter was due to the markedly higher concentration of terbutryn 7 61 μg l at this site although high this terbutryn level is still comparable to concentrations determined in surface waters elsewhere quednow and puttmann 2009 bollmann et al 2014 this high concentration implies a local source and is perhaps due to its use as an algicide in paint products remobilisation of secondary sources or unauthorized agricultural use as terbutryn has been banned as a herbicide in germany since 2003 similarly the use of alachlor atrazine isoproturon simazine and orysastrobin has been banned in eu but their occurrence and concentrations both as ctwa and cequil were consistent throughout all sampling sites it is remarkable that the persistence of several of these substances obviously does not match those reported in the authorization dossiers although the contribution of the pesticides from both the pocis and mps measurements was lower compared to the pharmaceuticals the actual ecotoxicological impact of these contaminants should be carefully assessed since these are designed to be potent towards particular organism groups for example le et al 2017 underlined that herbicides contributed most the total pesticide toxicity compared to fungicides and insecticides 3 4 estimation of ctotal from passive sampling measurement national e g the us cwa and canadian water quality guidelines and international regulations e g eu wfd and ospar have all established criteria for the assessment of water quality with the aim of reducing the risk of pollutants towards aquatic organisms and providing a safe water quality generally these are based on a comparison of total water concentrations ctotal with thresholds determined using acute and chronic toxicity data on the other hand it is the bioavailable dissolved concentrations as measured by passive sampling that better describe the toxicologically relevant concentrations escher et al 2005 this raises the question as to whether one can reliably convert the dissolved concentrations from passive sampling into total water concentrations this would open up the possibility of taking advantage of the benefits of passive sampling for aquatic monitoring but at the same time generate data that can be used for regulatory compliance to illustrate this the dissolved concentrations from this study were first converted into ctotal and these compared to the thresholds set out in environmental quality standards eqs directive the latter was selected as a case study since the study site was in germany but the implications equally apply to water quality thresholds in other regulatory frameworks ctotal was estimated from koc values obtained using pp lfers and the toc concentrations from the surface water measurements details in section 2 8 koc values were obtained for 20 target analytes not only priority substances but also other detected compounds from the ufz lser database v3 2 ulrich et al 2017 and used in equation 4 figure s4 these ctotal calculations are based on the measured toc concentration of 4 07 mg l which is in the lower range reported for surface waters furthermore the koc values refer to soil organic carbon whereas toc represents surface water organic carbon therefore it is important to bear in mind that these ctotal calculations are simply a good first approximation for most compounds in this study the sorbed fraction made up less than 2 of ctotal which can be almost considered negligible among the compounds shown in fig 4 the log koc values of diclofenac and pcp were highest but nevertheless the discrepancy between ctotal and ctwa or cequil was still only 1 74 15 47 and 1 07 13 48 respectively therefore at least for the compounds measured in this study the dissolved concentrations already provide a good and even slightly conservative indication of whether regulatory concentration thresholds are exceeded given the low toc levels differences between the total and dissolved concentrations really only become important for compounds with log kow values above around 6 carvalho et al 2016 the only contaminants with log kow above 6 were clotrimazole 6 26 and miconazole 6 25 unfortunately a koc for clotrimazole was not available from the ufz lser database although koc values were found for miconazole and ketoconazole neither a ctwa nor a cequil could be calculated for these compounds due to the lack of sampling rates and partitioning coefficients therefore further research is needed to better understand the limitations of this approach particularly for situations with higher toc concentrations for more hydrophobic compounds with higher koc values or where both apply in this study the ctwa of the eight priority substances have been compared to their respective aa eqs fig 2 these aa eqs values are based on chronic toxicity data and are usually applied to assess the impacts of long term exposure lepper 2005 here only the river samples are considered since the wwtp levels are diluted upon discharge the pocis derived ctwa of alachlor atrazine cybutryne diuron isoproturon simazine and pcp were all well below their respective aa eqs however two priority substances diclofenac and terbutryn had ctwa above their aa eqs at the saar river sites fig 2 for diclofenac this was the case for the ctwa calculations using both the low and high rs whereas for terbutryn this was only the case for for the high rs calculations mac eqs are based on acute toxicity results and cequil mps were compared to the respective mac eqs values considering the shorter time to reach equilibrium terbutryn was the only compound for which cequil mps exceeded its mac eqs at three sites however this result should perhaps be treated with caution since the corresponding cequil pes were lower and did not lead to mac eqs exceedances despite these also being equilibrium samples the reason behind these differences remains to be investigated 3 5 the implication of ctwa and cequil if a higher cequil than a ctwa is observed this could be indicative of a concentration peak in the period immediately prior to sampler recovery fig 2 and s2 show that in general the pocis derived ctwa were in the same range as the mps derived cequil which would indicate relatively constant concentration levels over the deployment period however some compounds had consistently higher cequil values for both equilibrium samplers this includes clotrimazole cybutryne flufenacet orysastrobin and thiabendazole perhaps for these compounds there was a peak concentration in the period prior to sampler recovery which was then reflected in the equilibrium sampler levels it should be kept in mind that the application of the mps as an equilbrium passive sampler applies only to the compounds of this study and for more hydrophobic compounds the response time would be longer such that rapidly changing concentration peaks would be missed to further shorten the response time of the mps its thickness could be adjusted depending on the sampling period of interest this is because partitioning from the aquatic environment to the sampler is controlled by the water boundary layer and the response time is thus proportional to the sampler thickness angel et al 2016 such short and repeated pulses in the concentrations of contaminants are highly relevant for adverse effects on aquatic organisms mohr et al 2012 therefore mps measurements could be more suitable to explore the ecological impacts resulting from contaminant exposure another very important advantage of the mps is its application for environmental mixture toxicity testing by using it in passive dosing mode the mps can be used to capture the complete bioavailable environmental mixture including those contaminants not identified with the targeted analysis performed in this study 3 6 conclusion and outlook the occurrence of organic contaminants in surface water varies depending on land use rain events and episodic spill events indeed the concentrations measured in this study showed variations between sampling sites sampler types and target compounds this illustrates the dynamic nature of aquatic contamination which is difficult to summarise using a single concentration and might also be missed with traditional grab sampling approaches in this regard passive sampling is particularly useful in terms of providing a representative value for the water quality vrana et al 2005 novic et al 2017 in this study low and high ctwa values plus a cequil pes from the pocis and a cequil mps from the mps were available from a 35 day deployment the role of passive sampling approaches in regulatory water monitoring has often been discussed booij et al 2016 brack et al 2017 passive sampling allows lower detection limits and simplifies analysis compared to traditional sampling methods loos 2012 although the provision of a dissolved concentration has been pointed out as a limitation of passive sampling the results obtained in this study show that the discrepancy between ctotal and ctwa is minor and quantifiable at least for the study compounds caution is needed as to the integrative nature of pocis since for some compounds equilibrium was reached during the sampling period furthermore for pocis accurate sampling rates and partition coefficients remain critical for a precise estimation of the environmental dissolved concentration and application of the prc approach to capture the in situ conditions remains challenging therefore the in situ influence of environmental parameters such as the water flow rate or biofouling is difficult to account for this is the reason why a probable range of ctwa has been given in fig 2 but it should be also noted that this range was no more than a factor of 3 5 for the pocis detected compounds the mps as an equilibrium passive sampler more provided a snapshot of contaminant levels prior to the sampler recovery which can be particularly informative in terms of ecological effects in contrast to pocis the prc approach worked well with the mps and confirmed its equilibrium sampling nature although future work should concentrate on its application in highly dynamic situations the mps sampled a similar range of organic contaminants to the pocis and also resulted in lower matrix effects during the lc ms ms analyses the sampling domain of the mps might be improved via use of other combinations of polymers furthermore since the mps is an equilibrium sampler it can potentially be used in passive dosing mode for the toxicity testing of field mixtures but this remains to be investigated overall passive samplers with different sampling modes can improve our understanding of surface water quality equilibrium and kinetic passive samplers deployed side by side can provide more complete information on short and long term exposure to aquatic pollutants acknowledgments we are grateful

19308,the performances of an equilibrium and a kinetic passive sampler for monitoring a range of organic contaminants log kow from 0 03 to 6 26 were evaluated in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant the receiving river saar as well as the river mosel in germany the polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis and a new mixed polymer sampler mps were selected as kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers respectively concentrations were described in terms of a time weighted average concentration ctwa from the pocis measurements and as an equilibrium concentration from the mps cequil mps and pocis membrane cequil pes analyses twenty seven compounds could be detected including eight priority substances of the eu water framework directive both sampler types detected a similar range of compounds in the low ng l to μg l range with a high proportion of pharmaceuticals being detected at all sampling sites to account for uncertainty in the pocis sampling rates a range in ctwa was estimated by applying low and high sampling rates for the compounds that were detected in the pocis this range was within a factor of 3 5 interestingly the mps extracts showed lower ionisation artefacts than the pocis extracts during the lc ms ms analysis finally total water concentrations ctotal were estimated from the dissolved concentrations literature organic carbon partition coefficients koc and the total organic carbon levels measured in the rivers for the compounds in this study negligible differences between ctotal and the passive sampler derived dissolved concentrations were found with a maximum difference of 15 for diclofenac overall this study demonstrated that the parallel application of kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers can improve the description of water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords passive sampling pocis mixed polymer sampler chemical profile surface water ctotal 1 introduction increased attention on organic contaminants in aquatic environments and their possible negative effects has triggered research into developing tools for the monitoring of water quality there is even a legislative demand for the monitoring of aquatic organic contaminants such as in the european union water framework directive eu wfd the united states clean water act us cwa or the oslo paris convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north east atlantic ospar improvements in analytical methods and instrumentation have resulted in high sensitivity and selectivity for the determination of an increasingly wide range of trace organic contaminants in aquatic environments nevertheless the initial sampling still remains a challenging step ort et al 2010 conventional sampling techniques such as grab sampling using containers are practical to apply but limited to a specific time and place loos 2012 in addition the relatively small sample volumes may lead to detection issues the latter might be overcome by using large volume samplers that can sample up to several hundred liters schulze et al 2017 flow proportional samplers take more representative samples yet still often only provide a limited volume and also require a power source ort et al 2010 finally the above sampling approaches often require a filtering or centrifugation step prior to analysis which can be associated with artefacts such as sorption to the filters or to third phases such as dissolved organic matter andrade eiroa et al 2016 such issues challenge a comprehensive assessment of water quality at the spatial and temporal scales here passive sampling is a promising tool with a number of advantages in situ application targeting a wide range of compounds over a prolonged period providing their bioavailable dissolved concentrations and selective concentration of the analytes on the sorbent to give clean samples to simplify the analysis vrana et al 2005 in passive sampling the contaminants partition to the sampler material via diffusion as driven by the differences in chemical potential between the environmental and sampler phases górecki and namieśnik 2002 the partitioned amount of chemical initially increases with time i e kinetic sampling mode until the sampler and surrounding medium reach an equilibrium such that the sampler concentrations remain constant i e equilibrium sampling mode both sampling modes have been applied for investigating contaminant levels in aquatic environments in kinetic mode the environmental dissolved concentration is estimated using a compound and sampler specific sampling rate determined in laboratory calibration experiments or via in situ calibration sampling in the kinetic uptake regime provides a time weighted average concentration ctwa which gives a longer term description of water quality vrana et al 2005 alvarez et al 2004 in equilibrium mode the sampler concentration is calibrated back to the environmental dissolved concentration using a compound and sampler specific equilibrium partition coefficient if the response time of the passive sampler is sufficiently fast compared to changes in the ambient concentrations then the equilibrium sampling concentrations cequil can depict the dissolved levels in the period prior to sampler recovery hawker 2010 how fast a passive sampler reaches equilibrium depends on the sampler format the contaminant properties as well as environmental conditions such as the water flow rate or temperature a further application of equilibrium passive sampling is for the initial sampling of environmental mixtures for their subsequent toxicity testing creusot et al 2014 emelogu et al 2013 however interfacing passive sampling with toxicity testing requires properly reproducing the bioavailable field mixture profile in the test which can only be achieved by combining equilibrium passive sampling with passive dosing jahnke et al 2017 therefore this requires suitable equilibrium passive samplers for both polar and non polar aquatic contaminants in this study kinetic and equilibrium passive sampling were compared for the monitoring of aquatic contaminants in german rivers the widely used polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis was selected as a representative kinetic passive sampler as an equilibrium passive sampler a new monophasic mixed polymer sampler mps was used the mps consists of oasis hlb sorbent the receiving phase of the pocis embedded in a polydimethylsiloxane pdms silicone matrix this has a better affinity for polar compounds compared to pdms alone jeong et al 2018 the two passive sampler formats were deployed over 35 days at five sampling sites along the rivers saar and mosel as well as in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharging into the river saar the chemical profiles accumulated in the samplers were converted into either ctwa or cequil to describe the surface water contaminant levels the specific aims of this study were i to compare the performance of the two passive sampler types with regards to their practicality and sampling characteristics ii to determine the environmental dissolved concentrations either as ctwa or cequil of a range of organic contaminants in two rivers and the outflow of the wwtp and iii to estimate total water concentrations ctotal from the passive sampling measurements to investigate its potential for meeting regulatory requirements which are based on ctotal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals target compounds were selected based on their detection frequency in surface waters loos

stainless steel washers were bought from wegertseder gmbh ortenburg germany all glassware and materials were cleaned in a dishwasher followed by rinsing with methanol prior to use 2 2 preparation of the passive samplers 2 2 1 mps a mixed polymer sampler mps was produced in house by combining pdms and oasis hlb jeong et al 2018 in brief pdms was dissolved in hexane and this solution cured in a petri dish at 4 c overnight to give a thin layer of pdms a suspension of oasis hlb and pdms in a mixed solvent of hexane and ethanol 1 1 v v was then added and allowed to cure finally a top layer of pdms was added before deployment the mps were cleaned by soaking twice in methanol and then twice in milli q water for 24 h each time details on the configuration of the mps are provided in table s2 the possibility of using performance reference compounds prcs with the mps was also tested a prc stock solution was prepared containing the 12 deuterated compounds at concentrations of around 1 μg ml one ml of this prc stock was added per mps contained in separate beakers the beakers were tightly closed and stored at room temperature in the dark for 17 days to give sufficient time for the prcs to distribute within the polymer after removing the mps 1 ml of methanol was added to rinse the beaker walls and this was analysed to calculate the mass of each compound loaded per mps 2 2 2 pocis pes membranes were pre conditioned by soaking in 10 ml of methanol overnight followed by storage in milli q water oasis hlb sorbent was prepared by shaking in methanol and pouring off the overlying methanol after repeating the cleaning procedure three times the oasis hlb was dried in a fume hood overnight the pocis was constructed by enclosing 218 74 1 82 mg of oasis hlb powder between two pes membranes and clamping these between two cleaned steel washers table s2 the amount of oasis hlb added was calculated following the sorbent to surface area ratio of 180 cm2 g from alvarez et al 2004 the assembled pocis were covered in the solvent rinsed aluminum foil until field deployment 2 3 laboratory calibration of passive samplers sampling rates rs and equilibrium passive sampler water partition coefficients ksw were available from a separate laboratory calibration experiment full details available in jeong et al 2018 and summarized in the si in short bottles containing 2 l of milli q water adjusted to ph 7 and with nominal concentrations of the target compounds of 20 μg l were prepared uptake of the target compounds in the passive samplers was measured over 512 h sampling rates for 34 compounds were determined under stirred and static conditions to reflect the influence of extremes in hydrodynamic conditions table s5 equilibrium partition coefficients of each passive sampler type were also determined table s5 2 4 field deployment passive samplers were deployed from 18 may to 22 june 2015 in the effluent from the brebach wwtp located in saarbrücken wwtp in fig 1 the receiving river saar saar1 saar2 and saar3 and in the river mosel adjacent to the inflow of the river saar the river saar is the longest and biggest tributary of the river mosel physicochemical parameters of the surface water including surface water temperature 17 22 1 49 c ph 7 80 0 16 and total organic carbon concentration toc 4 07 0 46 mg toc l were measured in situ at fortnightly or monthly intervals at two stations locations are marked on fig 1 at each sampling site duplicate pocis and triplicate or quadruplicate mps were attached to a wire cage and deployed for 35 days the mps were enclosed in copper mesh envelopes to limit biofouling field blank passive samplers triplicate for pocis and quadruplicate for mps were included to detect background contamination during the transportation deployment and recovery of the passive samplers 2 5 sampler extraction after the 35 day deployment all passive samplers were recovered immediately after collection the sampler surfaces were wiped with lab tissue enclosed in aluminum foil and stored at 20 c until extraction and analysis the pocis were separated into the pes membranes and oasis hlb sorbent by trapping the latter on a pre cleaned glass fiber filter gf f 47 mm diameter via rinsing the membranes with milli q water each was transferred to separate 20 ml headspace vials the mps were removed from their copper mesh envelope and carefully wiped with lab tissue to remove any organic residue from the sampler surface before placing in 20 ml headspace vials the pes membrane oasis hlb sorbent mps were separately extracted in their storage vials by adding 10 ml of methanol and shaking on the vertical rotator for 48 h after 48 h the methanol extracts were filtered with a 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filter fitted to a glass syringe and blown down to ca 1 ml under a gentle n2 stream using a turbovap lv biotage uppsala sweden this extraction procedure was repeated twice more to give a final volume of approximately 3 ml the exact volume of the combined methanol extracts was calculated by weight to make sure that all compounds had been extracted a fourth extraction was performed as above and the extracted concentrations analysed separately 2 6 lc ms ms analysis an hplc system 1290 infinity agilent technologies coupled to a 6460 qqq mass spectrophotometer agilent technologies equipped with a jet stream electrospray ionisation esi source was used for analysis of the 44 compounds analytical details are available in jeong et al 2017 briefly a gradient of milli q water containing 5 mm ammonium acetate and 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile was used to separate the target analytes on an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 rapid resolution high definition rrhd column 1 8 μm 2 1 mm 50 mm equipped with an uhplc guard column 1 8 μm 2 1 mm 5 mm dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mrm employing two transitions from a single precursor ion to two product ions was used in either positive or negative ionisation mode depending on the analyte contaminant levels in the passive samplers from the various the sampling sites and the remaining prcs in recovered mps were analysed in separate sequences quantification of the target analytes was done using the quantitative and qualitative modules of the masshunter workstation software version b 06 00 2 7 theoretical background the two passive samplers employed in this study have different sampling modes pocis is a kinetic sampler with a long linear uptake period for many compounds a time weighted average concentration of a contaminant in water ctwa ng l can be calculated from the measured sampler concentrations as follows booij et al 2007 1 c twa n s k sw m s 1 e x p r s t k sw m s where ns is the contaminant mass extracted from the passive sampler ng rs the compound specific sampling rate l day t the sampling period day ksw the sampler water partition coefficient l kg and ms the sampler mass kg when the compound specific uptake halftime t1 2 day is over 30 days which is assumed to be relatively long considering the sampling period i e 35 days in this study the partitioning of the analytes to the pocis remains in the linear uptake regime therefore equation 1 can be simplified to 2 c twa n s r s t one challenge in the interpretation of pocis data is the choice of the correct sampling rate rs this depends greatly on environmental conditions and in particular turbulence which is difficult to extrapolate from laboratory calibrations into the field therefore to derive upper and lower bounds in ctwa two sampling rates derived from calibration experiments and determined under strongly stirred and static condition were applied to cover the likely range of turbulences in the field in contrast a laboratory calibration experiment demonstrated that uptake halftimes of the target compounds in the mps were less than 12 days and this sampler is an equilibrium sampler the environmental dissolved concentration cequil ng l were derived as follows 3 c equil n s k sw m s the sampling rates and equilibrium partition coefficient values are available in si table s5 to further describe the kinetic characteristics of the mps halftimes and response times in the field were calculated from dissipation of the prcs as follows huckins et al 2002 4 c s c s 0 e x p k e t 5 t 1 2 ln 2 k e where cs is the prc concentration remaining in the mps at sampler recovery ng kg cs 0 the loaded prc concentration before the sampler deployment ng kg k e the elimination rate 1 day and t1 2 is the halftime days the sampler response time was then estimated from the reciprocal of k e 2 8 determination of ctotal from the passive sampling measurements in this study ctotal was calculated using the freely dissolved concentrations obtained from the passive sampling measurements cfree ctotal is the sum of the passive sampler derived values of cfree and the concentrations associated with the organic carbon present in the water csorbed csorbed was calculated using the following equation 6 c sorbed toc k oc c free where toc is the toc concentration kg toc l koc the organic carbon oc partition coefficient l water kg oc toc was measured by online photometers either every two weeks or monthly at two locations see fig 1 landesamt für umwelt und arbeitsschutz 2015 koc of the contaminants were predicted using poly parameter linear free energy relationships pp lfers obtained from the ufz lser database v 3 1 ulrich et al 2017 this calculation is based on three assumptions firstly that sorbed compounds were predominantly associated with particulate organic carbon in the water secondly the sampling area had homogenous and constant total organic carbon concentrations during the sampling period lastly that the koc values from the ufz database which are based on soil organic carbon are similar to those in surface water these are further discussed below 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of analytical procedure contaminant concentrations in the methanol extracts of the different samplers were determined using lc ms ms as described elsewhere jeong et al 2017 fifteen calibration standards ranging from 0 05 to 800 00 μg l were analysed at the beginning and the end of each sequence it was confirmed that there was no contamination of the pocis or mps before sampler deployment by analyzing the field blank samplers procedural blanks consisting of milli q water or methanol were analysed after every 5 6 samples to check carry over during the sequence significant peaks were only found for dehp in these blanks and it was not included in the further data treatment due to low analytical sensitivities six compounds were excluded from the further discussion i e bifenox clopyralid dichlorvos ibuprofen fluroxypyr and tribenuron methyl for the remaining 37 compounds a quadratic relationship between peak area and concentration was established with correlation coefficients r2 all above 0 95 in addition ilod and iloq were calculated and are available in a previous publication jeong et al 2017 as check standards low level calibration standards i e 0 40 0 78 1 56 μg l were routinely analysed at least every 15 samples and the relative standard deviations were less than 10 for most compounds in summary the analysis was accurate and sensitive enough to quantify 37 target analytes in the field samples ionisation suppression or enhancement is a major challenge in the electrospray ionisation source in lc ms ms analyses petrović et al 2005 therefore an evaluation of the matrix effects of environment samples is critical because this can lead to inaccurate quantification considering the fact that ionisation effects are compound sampler and site specific ionisation factors were determined for all compound sampler sample combinations using a simplified standard addition method details available in jeong et al 2018 in short duplicate aliquots of each extract were analysed in parallel one aliquot consisted of the passive sampler extract whereas the second was additionally spiked with 20 ng of each compound taking into account the range of field concentrations ionisation factors were calculated from the signal difference between the two aliquots ionisation effects of the 37 compounds have been presented in order of increasing retention times in figure s1 ionisation suppression is indicated by an ionisation factor of less than 1 and ionisation enhancement by a factor of more than 1 ionisation factors ranged by a factor of 24 from 0 08 for flufenacet up to 1 91 for atenolol both measured in wwtp effluent samples for the mps extracts by a factor of 70 from 0 05 for metoprolol mosel site up to 3 47 for thifensulfuron methyl saar1 site for the pes membrane extracts and by a factor of 42 from 0 06 for flufenacet saar2 site up to 2 54 for thifensulfuron methyl mosel site for the oasis hlb extracts although passive sampling is considered to be robust against matrix effects lissalde et al 2011 significant ionisation effects were observed for most of the target compounds sampler types as well as between samples from different sites for example chlorpyrifos did not give a peak in any of the samples despite no ionisation effects being observed in field blank samplers average ionisation factor of 0 97 this results in uncertainty as to whether it is absent from the river or whether it is present but the measurements are compromised by high ionisation suppression there was no clear relationship between ionisation factors and compound properties sampler configuration or different sampling sites for any given compound mps ionisation factors were rather consistent regardless of the sampling site this may be related to the fact that the mps were relatively clean after the 35 day deployment this might be due to the copper mesh limiting biofouling another explanation could be that the silicone surface of the sampler is less suitable for biofilm growth and or sorption of organic matter for pocis the ionisation factors from the pes membrane extracts were more variable than those from the oasis hlb with the biofouling seen on the membranes likely one of the main reasons organic matter adhering on the membranes was not easily removed especially compared to the mps surface in constrast the oasis hlb was not directly exposed to the environment and thus more protected from biofilm growth the disparate ionisation responses between the pes and oasis hlb extracts imply that the oasis hlb sorbent and pes membrane should always be extracted and analysed separately for an accurate quantification of pocis sorbed compounds to lower matrix effects a non damaging washing protocol for pes membranes has been developed by guibal et al 2015 in this study the calculated dissolved concentrations have been corrected using each compound sampler sample specific ionisation factor 3 2 quantitation of the surface water dissolved concentrations during the 35 days sampling period noticeable sorbent loss was found in only one pocis from saar2 and this was therefore not analysed apart from this all passive samplers could be recovered and were analysed to derive the dissolved concentrations at the five sampling sites for the pocis contaminant levels could be described using both a ctwa and a cequil pes from the mps measurements these were described using a cequil mps field blank pocis and mps measurements did not reveal any airborne contamination twenty seven out of the 37 analysed compounds were detected using at least one of the two passive sampler formats and the ctwa or cequil of each determined fig 2 and s2 table s7 the detected compounds covered a broad range of log kow from 0 06 atenolol up to 6 26 clotrimazole seventeen compounds were detected at all sampling sites with the mps whereas 22 compounds were found at all sites by pocis atenolol and mcpa were only detected using pocis sulfamethoxazole and gemfibrozil were only observed using mps in the wwtp effluent but were detected using pocis at the other sampling sites alachlor was consistently detected by the mps at all sampling sites but measured by pocis at only one sampling site therefore there was a large overlap in the range of compounds detected using either mps or pocis and both sampler types are complementary the fungicides econazole ketoconazole and miconazole were measured in the sampler extracts but rs and ksw are not available and their dissolved field concentrations could not be determined figure s3 table s8 note that aqueous ph in the laboratory calibration experiment ph 7 and at the sampling sites ph 7 8 was different this may affect uptake rates and partition coefficients to the pocis and the mps especially for ionisable compounds however such effects are likely small since over this ph range sulfamethoxazole remains predomintaly anioic 87 at ph 7 and 98 at ph 7 8 whereas clotrimazole always remains mainly neutral 85 at ph 7 and 98 at ph 7 8 3 2 1 oasis hlb of pocis measurements ctwa uncertainty in rs has been underlined as one of the main limitations of pocis miège et al 2012 to date various calibration methods including in silico and prc approaches have been attempted for in situ calibration miller et al 2016 carpinteiro et al 2016 however available rs values remain variable which challenges quantitation of the environmental dissolved concentrations note that for pocis the prc approach was not used in this study and the true in situ impact of environmental parameters such as flow rate and temperature on rs remains a source of uncertainty for the pocis two ctwa values were calculated using the amounts accumulated on the oasis hlb in conjunction with the lowest representing static conditions and highest representing highly turbulent conditions rs from a laboratory calibration experiment the impact of mixing on rs was below a factor of 9 for the complete set of target analytes and the difference between the low and high ctwa for the compounds that were actually measured in this study ranged from only 1 2 for 2 4 d up to 3 5 for atrazine see fig 2 and s2 the two values in ctwa thus represent upper and lower bounds that might be expected in the field and imply that the true dissolved concentrations can be estimated to within a factor of 3 5 regardless of extremes in hydrodynamic conditions for some compounds accumulating in the pocis the uptake halftimes obtained from the calibration experiment were relatively short even under the static conditions these included atenolol carbendazim clotrimazole mcpa and sulfamethoxazole which all had halftimes of less than 15 days this implies that during the 35 day deployment the pocis was no longer acting as a kinetic but rather as an equilibrium sampler for these compounds therefore their dissolved concentrations were calculated from the accumulated amounts using the equilibrium partition coefficients from jeong et al 2018 and equation 3 figure s2 and table s7 to avoid confusion these have still been termed ctwa to make clear they are derived from the pocis measurements but have been marked with an asterisk ctwa ranged from 0 19 ng l for napropamid saar3 up to 37 84 μg l for metoprolol wwtp the low dissolved concentrations that could be detected using pocis underline its suitability for sampling trace levels of aquatic contaminants in general the highest ctwa values of over 1 μg l were observed for four pharmaceuticals atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac and metoprolol as well as pentachlorophenol pcp for example the lower ctwa estimate for diclofenac was 36 μg l and 38 μg l for metropolol both in the wwtp effluent although markedly higher concentrations in the wwtp effluents were determined for the pharmaceuticals and a few compounds such as pcp for the remaining compounds the concentrations determined in the wwtp effluent were similar or only marginally higher than the river levels bearing in mind that these effluents are diluted by the river water this has repercussions as to the magnitude of the wwtp as a contributory source of these compounds to the saar river furthermore ctwa were relatively similar along the saar and mosel river sites 3 2 2 pes membrane of pocis measurements cequil pes previous studies have reported that sorption to the pocis membranes is considerable for some compounds vermeirssen et al 2012 and that the pes membranes can themselves be used as passive samplers posada ureta et al 2017 therefore in addition to ctwa cequil pes values were calculated using the measured pes concentrations and the kpesw determined in the calibration experiment cequil pes could be determined for the 21 compounds with both a quantifiable signal and a value of kpesw note that cequil pes could be calculated even for compounds with low kpesw values such as 2 4 d cybutryne flufenacet and orysastrobin see table s5 cequil pes ranged from 2 12 ng l napropamid at saar3 to 10 60 μg l diclofenac at wwtp when compared with the ctwa estimates the values of cequil pes were either similar or at least in the same range for most compounds and sampling sites see fig 2 and s1 exceptionally large differences were found for 2 4 d and clotrimazole where cequil pes were up to 64 and 34 times higher than the respective ctwa values one explanation could be that the equilibrium sampling nature of the pes membranes means that a peak in concentrations prior to the samples being recovered was picked up whereas this would only be reflected in a slightly higher ctwa however this is unlikely due to this difference in cequil pes not being reflected in the corresponding cequil mps which was measured using another equilibrium sampler for the remaining compounds the differences were less than a factor of 20 see table s7 although some compounds consistently had lower cequil pes values e g atrazine whereas others had cequil pes higher values e g cybutryne the basic assumption behind the cequil pes calculation is that the pes membrane reaches equilibrium however this may not be valid for pocis during kinetic uptake given that partitioning within the sampler is still ongoing and lag effects due to sorption by the pes membrane should be considered jeong et al 2018 vermeirssen et al 2012 this is further complicated when the concentrations in the surrounding water fluctuate as the overall equilibrium status is continuously shifted consequently the accumulated amount of analyte is not simply determined by the environmental dissolved concentration and kpesw but an intricate combination of changing environmental dissolved concentrations the relative affinity of the pes and oasis hlb components lag effects due to the pes membranes and environmental parameters 3 2 3 mps measurements cequil mps the mps was considered to act as an equilibrium sampler jeong et al 2018 which is supported by two aspects firstly the uptake halftimes obtained from the calibration experiment were less than 15 days for all compounds except for diclofenac and metoprolol 45 8 and 18 0 days respectively secondly to better understand the role of the in situ conditions on the sampler uptake prcs were loaded onto the mps before deployment analysis of the prc levels remaining after sampler recovery allowed elimination constants k e and the associated halftimes t1 2 to be calculated for the mps deployed at each of the sites table s3 all loaded deuterated compounds were significantly dissipated by over 90 after the 35 days regardless of their hydrophobicity or other physicochemical properties log d of prcs ranged from 2 14 for atenolol to 4 30 for chlorfenvinphos such dissipation rates resulted in t1 2 values that were mostly in the 3 5 day range and all lower than 8 days table s3 even the in situ halftimes of diclofenac and metoprolol were less than 8 days from these prc dissipation measurements the corresponding response times calculated after huckins et al 1993 ranged from 4 1 days for metoprolol at saar3 to 11 2 days for diclofenac at saar2 table s4 this confirms the results of the calibration experiment and indicates that the mps were likely close to equilibrium after their deployment note also that there was no lag effect due to the absence of membranes in the mps application of equilibrium passive samplers requires that stable ambient concentrations are maintained for longer periods than the corresponding response time of the sampler mayer et al 2003 however as discussed in hawker 2010 when water concentrations fluctuate significantly over shorter time scales then the mps would not reach a true partitioning equilibrium although this situation is unlikely to have occured for all of the sampled compounds due to their numerous input sources and the large water volumes of the river acting as a buffer ht it could nevertheless have been an issue for acute inputs e g illegal discharges accidents investigating this would require a high resolution grab sampling campaign which although beyond the scope of this study is a worthwhile research topic for the future therefore the mps was considered to function as an equilibrium passive sampler and equation 3 was used to derive cequil mps cequil mps values ranged from 0 93 ng l napropamid at saar1 to 7 61 μg l terbutryn at mosel these are in the similar range as the corresponding ctwa and cequil pes values and again the low dissolved concentrations that could be detected attest to passive sampling as a sensitive sampling approach the high loads of some pharmaceuticals that were detected by pocis were not so well detected by mps e g atenolol and sulfamethoxazole in figure s2 despite the same sorbent used as the receiving phase i e oasis hlb the lack of detection by the mps can perhaps be explained by the fact that overall the kmps is lower than kpocis and they were thus less concentrated in the sampler jeong et al 2018 nevertheless the mps still detected a similar range of organic contaminants as the pocis this means they can be deployed in parallel as kinetic and equilibrium samplers to better monitor short term changes in concentrations and or for the initial sampling of environmental mixtures for toxicity testing the mps and pes membranes of the pocis both functioned as equilibrium passive samplers and for the majority of compounds comparable cequil values were observed e g see atrazine cybutryne diuron and isoproturon in fig 2 where differences were within a factor of 2 3 this is encouraging given that although both operate in the equilibrium regime they are completely different formats made of different materials and use independently determined values to describe their partitioning affinity for a few compounds such as terbutryn cequil mps higher at all sites or 2 4 d cequil mps lower at all river sites differences over a factor of 100 were observed the exact reasons are unclear but could be due to differences in the sampler equilibration halftimes meaning that they sample over different time frames the pes membrane not reaching full equilibrium see discussion above or uncertainty in the equilibrium partitioning coefficients 3 3 chemical profile absolute proportions of the different compound classes e g pharmaceuticals pesticides etc are dependent on the list of target analytes however since these were the same for all sampling sites a comparison of the contribution of different classes allows inferences to be made as to the likely sources of contamination to a particular site indeed chemical profiles between the saar and mosel rivers were different which is probably related to differences in the watershed size land use and the amount of discharge the target analytes have been divided into pharmaceuticals and pesticides and the latter further classified as herbicides fungicides algicides and insecticide table s1 a preponderance of pharmaceuticals was found indicating that wwtp remains a major input pathway of these compounds to the rivers fig 3 the percentage of ctwa of pharmaceuticals to the total ctwa i e the sum of ctwa of all analytes for each sample ranged from 72 50 to 88 19 apart from the mosel site where they only contributed 6 37 the percentage of cequil mps of pharmaceuticals to the total cequil mps was similarly dominant and ranged from 43 35 to 71 51 the passive sampler derived concentrations from this study fall within or at the higher end of the range reported in other studies in europe loos et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 meyer et al 2016 high pharmaceutical loads likely result from their high prescription amounts combined with their low removal rate during wastewater treatment meyer et al 2016 al aukidy et al 2012 ter laak et al 2010 among the pharmaceuticals both carbamazepine ctwa 205 11 ng l to 533 51 ng l and metoprolol ctwa 210 96 ng l to 945 49 ng l were particularly abundant in river water in fact carbamazepine has been adopted as an anthropogenic marker to indicate a severe anthropogenic burden on sampling sites kahle et al 2009 overall the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the receiving rivers implies the need for additional treatment steps to ensure their removal combined with further studies regarding the potential impact of wwtp in the contamination of the receiving waters zenker et al 2014 in general the concentrations and contributions of the pesticides as a group either as ctwa or cequil were relatively constant across all river sites and in good agreement with reported values in previous studies moschet et al 2015 poulier et al 2015 the percentage of ctwa of the pesticides as a group to the total ctwa ranged from 11 81 to 27 50 the percentage of cequil mps to the total cequil mps ranged from 28 49 to 56 65 with the exception of the cequil mps of 93 63 found for the mosel site fig 3 the latter was due to the markedly higher concentration of terbutryn 7 61 μg l at this site although high this terbutryn level is still comparable to concentrations determined in surface waters elsewhere quednow and puttmann 2009 bollmann et al 2014 this high concentration implies a local source and is perhaps due to its use as an algicide in paint products remobilisation of secondary sources or unauthorized agricultural use as terbutryn has been banned as a herbicide in germany since 2003 similarly the use of alachlor atrazine isoproturon simazine and orysastrobin has been banned in eu but their occurrence and concentrations both as ctwa and cequil were consistent throughout all sampling sites it is remarkable that the persistence of several of these substances obviously does not match those reported in the authorization dossiers although the contribution of the pesticides from both the pocis and mps measurements was lower compared to the pharmaceuticals the actual ecotoxicological impact of these contaminants should be carefully assessed since these are designed to be potent towards particular organism groups for example le et al 2017 underlined that herbicides contributed most the total pesticide toxicity compared to fungicides and insecticides 3 4 estimation of ctotal from passive sampling measurement national e g the us cwa and canadian water quality guidelines and international regulations e g eu wfd and ospar have all established criteria for the assessment of water quality with the aim of reducing the risk of pollutants towards aquatic organisms and providing a safe water quality generally these are based on a comparison of total water concentrations ctotal with thresholds determined using acute and chronic toxicity data on the other hand it is the bioavailable dissolved concentrations as measured by passive sampling that better describe the toxicologically relevant concentrations escher et al 2005 this raises the question as to whether one can reliably convert the dissolved concentrations from passive sampling into total water concentrations this would open up the possibility of taking advantage of the benefits of passive sampling for aquatic monitoring but at the same time generate data that can be used for regulatory compliance to illustrate this the dissolved concentrations from this study were first converted into ctotal and these compared to the thresholds set out in environmental quality standards eqs directive the latter was selected as a case study since the study site was in germany but the implications equally apply to water quality thresholds in other regulatory frameworks ctotal was estimated from koc values obtained using pp lfers and the toc concentrations from the surface water measurements details in section 2 8 koc values were obtained for 20 target analytes not only priority substances but also other detected compounds from the ufz lser database v3 2 ulrich et al 2017 and used in equation 4 figure s4 these ctotal calculations are based on the measured toc concentration of 4 07 mg l which is in the lower range reported for surface waters furthermore the koc values refer to soil organic carbon whereas toc represents surface water organic carbon therefore it is important to bear in mind that these ctotal calculations are simply a good first approximation for most compounds in this study the sorbed fraction made up less than 2 of ctotal which can be almost considered negligible among the compounds shown in fig 4 the log koc values of diclofenac and pcp were highest but nevertheless the discrepancy between ctotal and ctwa or cequil was still only 1 74 15 47 and 1 07 13 48 respectively therefore at least for the compounds measured in this study the dissolved concentrations already provide a good and even slightly conservative indication of whether regulatory concentration thresholds are exceeded given the low toc levels differences between the total and dissolved concentrations really only become important for compounds with log kow values above around 6 carvalho et al 2016 the only contaminants with log kow above 6 were clotrimazole 6 26 and miconazole 6 25 unfortunately a koc for clotrimazole was not available from the ufz lser database although koc values were found for miconazole and ketoconazole neither a ctwa nor a cequil could be calculated for these compounds due to the lack of sampling rates and partitioning coefficients therefore further research is needed to better understand the limitations of this approach particularly for situations with higher toc concentrations for more hydrophobic compounds with higher koc values or where both apply in this study the ctwa of the eight priority substances have been compared to their respective aa eqs fig 2 these aa eqs values are based on chronic toxicity data and are usually applied to assess the impacts of long term exposure lepper 2005 here only the river samples are considered since the wwtp levels are diluted upon discharge the pocis derived ctwa of alachlor atrazine cybutryne diuron isoproturon simazine and pcp were all well below their respective aa eqs however two priority substances diclofenac and terbutryn had ctwa above their aa eqs at the saar river sites fig 2 for diclofenac this was the case for the ctwa calculations using both the low and high rs whereas for terbutryn this was only the case for for the high rs calculations mac eqs are based on acute toxicity results and cequil mps were compared to the respective mac eqs values considering the shorter time to reach equilibrium terbutryn was the only compound for which cequil mps exceeded its mac eqs at three sites however this result should perhaps be treated with caution since the corresponding cequil pes were lower and did not lead to mac eqs exceedances despite these also being equilibrium samples the reason behind these differences remains to be investigated 3 5 the implication of ctwa and cequil if a higher cequil than a ctwa is observed this could be indicative of a concentration peak in the period immediately prior to sampler recovery fig 2 and s2 show that in general the pocis derived ctwa were in the same range as the mps derived cequil which would indicate relatively constant concentration levels over the deployment period however some compounds had consistently higher cequil values for both equilibrium samplers this includes clotrimazole cybutryne flufenacet orysastrobin and thiabendazole perhaps for these compounds there was a peak concentration in the period prior to sampler recovery which was then reflected in the equilibrium sampler levels it should be kept in mind that the application of the mps as an equilbrium passive sampler applies only to the compounds of this study and for more hydrophobic compounds the response time would be longer such that rapidly changing concentration peaks would be missed to further shorten the response time of the mps its thickness could be adjusted depending on the sampling period of interest this is because partitioning from the aquatic environment to the sampler is controlled by the water boundary layer and the response time is thus proportional to the sampler thickness angel et al 2016 such short and repeated pulses in the concentrations of contaminants are highly relevant for adverse effects on aquatic organisms mohr et al 2012 therefore mps measurements could be more suitable to explore the ecological impacts resulting from contaminant exposure another very important advantage of the mps is its application for environmental mixture toxicity testing by using it in passive dosing mode the mps can be used to capture the complete bioavailable environmental mixture including those contaminants not identified with the targeted analysis performed in this study 3 6 conclusion and outlook the occurrence of organic contaminants in surface water varies depending on land use rain events and episodic spill events indeed the concentrations measured in this study showed variations between sampling sites sampler types and target compounds this illustrates the dynamic nature of aquatic contamination which is difficult to summarise using a single concentration and might also be missed with traditional grab sampling approaches in this regard passive sampling is particularly useful in terms of providing a representative value for the water quality vrana et al 2005 novic et al 2017 in this study low and high ctwa values plus a cequil pes from the pocis and a cequil mps from the mps were available from a 35 day deployment the role of passive sampling approaches in regulatory water monitoring has often been discussed booij et al 2016 brack et al 2017 passive sampling allows lower detection limits and simplifies analysis compared to traditional sampling methods loos 2012 although the provision of a dissolved concentration has been pointed out as a limitation of passive sampling the results obtained in this study show that the discrepancy between ctotal and ctwa is minor and quantifiable at least for the study compounds caution is needed as to the integrative nature of pocis since for some compounds equilibrium was reached during the sampling period furthermore for pocis accurate sampling rates and partition coefficients remain critical for a precise estimation of the environmental dissolved concentration and application of the prc approach to capture the in situ conditions remains challenging therefore the in situ influence of environmental parameters such as the water flow rate or biofouling is difficult to account for this is the reason why a probable range of ctwa has been given in fig 2 but it should be also noted that this range was no more than a factor of 3 5 for the pocis detected compounds the mps as an equilibrium passive sampler more provided a snapshot of contaminant levels prior to the sampler recovery which can be particularly informative in terms of ecological effects in contrast to pocis the prc approach worked well with the mps and confirmed its equilibrium sampling nature although future work should concentrate on its application in highly dynamic situations the mps sampled a similar range of organic contaminants to the pocis and also resulted in lower matrix effects during the lc ms ms analyses the sampling domain of the mps might be improved via use of other combinations of polymers furthermore since the mps is an equilibrium sampler it can potentially be used in passive dosing mode for the toxicity testing of field mixtures but this remains to be investigated overall passive samplers with different sampling modes can improve our understanding of surface water quality equilibrium and kinetic passive samplers deployed side by side can provide more complete information on short and long term exposure to aquatic pollutants acknowledgments we are grateful

19309,ultrasound is widely used in water and wastewater treatment however the influence of ultrasound on the composition and structure of dissolved organic matter dom and consequently its behaviors is still unclear in this study the changes in proton and metal binding moieties in dom caused by ultrasound at an environmentally relevant concentration about 5 mg l 1 were investigated using spectrophotometric titrations the amounts of carboxylic and phenolic like groups in dom before and after ultrasound were quantified by the spectral parameter dslope350 400 the differential slope of the log transformed dom absorbance in the wavelength region of 350 400 nm in combination with the non ideal competitive adsorption nica model the results demonstrate that the concentration of carboxylic like sites decreased with an increase in the ultrasound intensity at the same reaction time however the concentration of phenolic like sites increased with an increase in the ultrasound intensity in most cases the amounts of bound metal ca ii and al iii ions decreased with an increase of the ultrasound intensity due to the reduction of available total binding sites carboxylic like and phenolic like groups in the dom after ultrasound this study provides detailed in situ information concerning the changes in the properties and behaviors of dom in ultrasound which would be useful

concentrations caused by the additions of ca clo4 2 al clo4 3 hclo4 and naoh during the experiments were accounted for by means of measuring the volumes of the added reagents at each step during the variation of the total metal concentrations and correcting the measured absorbance using the ratio of the solution volume at any current state of the system to its initial volume 100 ml after each addition of naoh or metal stock the solutions were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min prior to the removal of 15 ml aliquots for the acquisition of the absorbance spectrum the aliquots were then added

proton affinity distributions for these groups while mcarboxylic and mphenolic define the widths of these distributions and are measurements of the apparent heterogeneity of the dom 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of ultrasound the effect of the ultrasound power on the srfa and aha solutions were investigated the performance of srfa was similar to that of aha in general but it would be obviously carbonized at high ultrasound powers 360 w the results of aha were shown in fig 1 as an example the results of srfa were shown in fig s1 in supporting information si section the concentration of doc decreased slightly with the increase of the ultrasound power fig 1a which was consistent with previous research naddeo et al 2007 zúñiga benítez et al 2015 meanwhile the turbidity of the solution increased with the increase of the ultrasound power especially at powers above 360 w fig 1b this cannot be explained by the view that macromolecules could be decomposed into hydrophilic and smaller molecules by ultrasound irradiation naddeo et al 2007 we hypothesized that the structure and charge of the dom had changed significantly during the ultrasound process resulting in the instability and precipitation of dom to further explore effects of ultrasound on the structure and properties of dom dom samples before and after ultrasound were further characterized by the spectrophotometric titrations after filtered by 0 45 μm membrane 3 2 influence of ultrasound on the protonation deprotonation properties of srfa and aha the absorbance spectra of srfa and aha at various ph values in the range of 3 11 were recorded before and after ultrasound they were consistent with the results in previous literature yan et al 2014c and the original spectra of ph spectrophotometric titrations changed slightly and were featureless obvious changes cannot be found before and after ultrasound das corresponding to the varying ph values were calculated using equation 1 and were shown in fig 2 there are several peaks located at ca 245 280 320 and 380 nm that could be found in the das of srfa yan et al 2014c the appearance of these bands may be due to the changes of the electron distribution before and after protonation deprotonation and or other non specific effects associated with deprotonation could induce the changes of inter chromophore interactions and conformations in dom molecules yan et al 2014b meanwhile only an obvious peak located at ca 280 nm could be found this feature in the das of aha is not as prominent as for srfa because its composition is more complicated yan et al 2014c it can be found that the shape of the das before and after ultrasound has not changed significantly but the intensity of the das decreased with the increase of the ultrasound power regardless of aha or srfa according to prior literature dryer et al 2008 janot et al 2010 yan et al 2014b the changes in the das indicated that ultrasound caused the modification of the structural characteristics and composition of dom especially the two major groups carboxylic and phenolic groups of protonation active functionalities in dom it has been demonstrated that the spectral parameter dslope350 400 is well correlated with the amount of protons bound onto carboxylic and phenolic functional groups of dom gao et al 2015 yan et al 2016b in this study dslope350 400 was calculated using equation 2 and applied to examine the extent of changes of protonation active functionalities in dom before and after ultrasound the evolution of the dslope350 400 values of srfa and aha as a function of ph were shown in fig 3 it indicates that ultrasound has obvious effects on the protonation deprotonation properties of dom chromophores for both srfa and aha the increase of ultrasound power led to a gradual decrease of the value of the dslope350 400 the data were further interpreted by a revised nica model to quantify the amount of carboxylic like and phenolic like functional groups in dom benedetti et al 1995 kinniburgh et al 1999 as shown in fig 3 the experimental data could be described well by the revised nica for both srfa and aha at various ultrasound powers typical r2 0 99 the parameters applied in the revised nica model for each set were shown in table 1 the amount of carboxylic like groups in the dom tended to decrease with the increase of the ultrasound power except for aha at high ultrasound power 480 w while the amount of phenolic like groups had a certain degree of increase except for aha at high ultrasound power 480 w in general the total binding sites in dom decreased with an increase of ultrasound power there was a great difference in the content of protonation deprotonation functional groups between srfa and aha which was almost 1 order higher in srfa than aha this was consistent with the literature data indicating that fulvic acid has a lower c o ratio than humic acid janot et al 2010 milne et al 2003 ritchie and perdue 2003 especially given that aha is a chemical humic substance with a high molecular weight and complicated composition the removal rate of carboxylic groups 38 96 at 480 w in aha was lower than that of srfa 79 00 at 240 w and the rate of increase of phenolic groups 26 30 at 480 w was higher than that of srfa 16 50 at 240 w aha is mainly composed of macromolecules and oh radicals formed under ultrasound could decompose them to form small molecules and phenolic like groups kotronarou et al 1991 resulting in a significant increase in the phenolic like groups in aha while srfa is mainly composed of small molecules and oh radicals could further oxidize srfa resulting in the carboxylic groups being significantly decomposed they would be carbonized if the experiment was carried out at high ultrasound power 240 w 3 3 influence of ultrasound on the metal ion binding properties of srfa and aha the effects of ultrasound on the interactions between dom and metal ions ca ii and al iii were further explored the das results of srfa caused by ca ii and al iii binding were shown in fig 4 as an example the data for aha were shown in fig s2 in si for the two examined metal ions ca ii and al iii peaks with maxima located at ca 245 280 320 and 380 nm could be found which was consistent with the result of ph das shown above as well as the results in the literature yan and korshin 2014 meanwhile the relative intensities of each peak were different between ca ii and al iii resulting in the different shapes of these differential spectra for ca ii and al iii especially in the low wavelength range 300 nm the metal specific feature in das demonstrates the discrete functionalities and structures of dom to interact with metal ions yan and korshin 2014 the ultrasound had no significant influence on the shape of the das caused by ca ii and al iii binding but the intensity of the das caused by ca ii and al iii binding obviously decreased with the increase of ultrasound power especially for ca ii in prior literature yan et al 2013b 2014b 2014c 2015 2016b it has been demonstrated that the spectral parameter dslope350 400 has good linear correlation with the metals bound onto dom including ca ii and al iii accordingly we used the dslope350 400 values measured at varying concentrations of ca ii and al iii to quantify the amounts of metal bound onto the dom before and after ultrasound the results for srfa and aha were shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively as shown in fig 5 the dslope350 400 value increased with increases in the concentrations of both total ca ii and al iii but the changes in the dslope350 400 value of ca ii were one order lower than those of al although its concentration was two orders higher than that of al iii with the increase of ultrasound power the dslope350 400 values decreased for both ca ii and al iii especially at a high ultrasound power of 240 w and high concentrations of ca ii as shown in fig 6 the aha was similar to srfa in that the dslope350 400 value increased with the increases in both the total ca ii and al iii concentrations but the changes in the dslope350 400 of aha caused by ca ii and al iii were comparable when the concentration of ca ii was two orders higher than that of al iii the effect of ultrasound on the dslope350 400 values was slight at 60 w but it was more obvious for both ca ii and al iii at a high ultrasound power of 480 w especially for al iii the different trends between ca ii and al iii reflect the different mechanisms of their interactions with dom samples according to the nica donnan model most of the metal ions bound to dom can be operationally attributed to binding onto carboxylic and phenolic functional groups and they participate in non discrete donnan gel electrostatic interactions benedetti et al 1995 kinniburgh et al 1999 al iii shows a higher ability than ca ii to bind onto dom and the dominant al dom binding is with phenolic like groups meanwhile besides the non discrete donnan gel electrostatic interactions the dominant fraction of bound ca ii is carboxylic ca based on the results above regarding functional groups it is reasonable that the amount of the ca ii decrease is significant for srfa as there is a significant decrease in carboxylic like groups in the case of aha the content of phenolic like groups decreases at high ultrasound power which leads to the bound al decreasing more obviously than for srfa 4 conclusion 1 the effects of ultrasound on the changes in proton binding moieties in dom at environmentally relevant concentrations were determined using the das approach the engagement of proton binding moieties of dom was well quantified by the revised non ideal competitive adsorption nica model it demonstrates that the concentration of carboxylic groups decreased with the increase of ultrasound power and the concentration of the operationally defined phenolic groups increased with the increase of ultrasound power expect for aha at high ultrasound power 480 w 2 the amounts of bound metal ions ca ii and al iii before and after ultrasound could be quantified by the das approach and they decreased with the decrease in the available total binding sites carboxylic like and phenolic like groups in dom after ultrasound 3 the approach presented in this study provides in situ information concerning the existence of ultrasound induced changes in the composition and reactivities of dom it would be useful to understand in more detail and ultimately optimize the utility of ultrasound in water treatment

19309,ultrasound is widely used in water and wastewater treatment however the influence of ultrasound on the composition and structure of dissolved organic matter dom and consequently its behaviors is still unclear in this study the changes in proton and metal binding moieties in dom caused by ultrasound at an environmentally relevant concentration about 5 mg l 1 were investigated using spectrophotometric titrations the amounts of carboxylic and phenolic like groups in dom before and after ultrasound were quantified by the spectral parameter dslope350 400 the differential slope of the log transformed dom absorbance in the wavelength region of 350 400 nm in combination with the non ideal competitive adsorption nica model the results demonstrate that the concentration of carboxylic like sites decreased with an increase in the ultrasound intensity at the same reaction time however the concentration of phenolic like sites increased with an increase in the ultrasound intensity in most cases the amounts of bound metal ca ii and al iii ions decreased with an increase of the ultrasound intensity due to the reduction of available total binding sites carboxylic like and phenolic like groups in the dom after ultrasound this study provides detailed in situ information concerning the changes in the properties and behaviors of dom in ultrasound which would be useful

pollutants chiha et al 2011 dailianis et al 2014 mahvi 2009 mendez arriaga et al 2008 and pharmaceutical organic pollutants tran et al 2015 as well as dissolved organic matter dom in membrane foulants and sludge chemat et al 2001 naddeo et al 2007 due to no chemical cleaning reagent and a high efficiency in removing organic foulants the application of ultrasound is attractive in membrane systems to enhance ultrafiltration permeate fluxes cai et al 2010 gao et al 2012 kyllonen et al 2005 muthukumaran et al 2005 ultrasound disintegration is a very promising sludge pretreatment method because it can change the structure of sludge particles as well as the moisture content of the sludge and thus improve the sludge dewatering performance zhou et al 2016 the performance of ultrasound is significantly dependent on the operating parameters e g intensity and time of sonication solvent temperature and the composition of impurities themselves al juboori et al 2016 naddeo et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 it is found that the aromatic rings in organic molecules could be broken by ultrasound naddeo et al 2007 nagata et al 1996 and the hydrophobic fractions could be transformed into the hydrophilic fraction in the field of ultrasound al juboori et al 2016 several regression models have been developed to predict the removal of dom and other substances by ultrasound with various operating parameters al juboori et al 2016 nanzai et al 2009 okitsu et al 2005 2009 serpone and colarusso 1994 xu et al 2015 despite the extent of these studies quantitative data correlating ultrasound conditions and resultant changes in the intrinsic chemistry of dom for example its proton and metal binding capacity are limited and such data are highly important for achieving a detailed understanding of the properties and behaviors of dom this is partly because of the limitations of the quantitative method to characterize the changes of heterogeneous dom at realistic concentrations in water and wastewater treatment leenheer and croué 2003 yan et al 2014b 2014c recent research has demonstrated that differential absorbance spectra das which compare the subtle changes in dom absorbance as a function of the reaction coordinate of dom measured at environmentally relevant concentrations have consistently observed features that are associated with various processes such as

properties and behaviors of dom in ultrasound the changes in proton binding moieties in dom caused by ultrasound were quantified using ph spectrophotometric titrations in combination with a non ideal competitive adsorption nica model the effects of ultrasound on the behaviors of dom to bind with metal ions were investigated using ca2 and al3 metal ions as examples ca2 was selected because it is the most abundant background cation in natural water al3 was selected because it is widely used as a coagulant together with ultrasound in water and wastewater treatment these results have the potential to allow understanding of the mechanism of ultrasound and to optimize the utility of ultrasound in water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals all

strength at 0 01 mol l 1 2 2 ultrasound experiments ultrasound experiments were carried out at 25 c in a water bath the volume of the srfa and aha water sample used in each experiment was 400 ml the samples were treated at five electrical powers of 60 120 240 360 and 480 w respectively the reaction time was 2 h the ph of the solutions was maintained at a ph of 6 00 0 05 by adding diluted hclo4 or naoh as necessary part of samples before and after ultrasound were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polypropylene membrane for doc and spectrophotometric titrations 2 3 spectrophotometric titrations the methods for the spectrophotometric titrations of the ph and metals were described in previous literature yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 the ph was regulated by adding required volumes of solutions of hclo4 or naoh at concentrations of 0 01 0 1 or 1 m during the experiment ca ii and al iii titrations were conducted by adding the required amount of ca ii and al iii stock prepared using ca clo4 2 and al clo4 3 the amount of ca ii and al iii added were below their precipitation level determined based on visual minteq calculations for each used ph minor changes in the dom concentrations caused by the additions of ca clo4 2 al clo4 3 hclo4 and naoh during the experiments were accounted for by means of measuring the volumes of the added reagents at each step during the variation of the total metal concentrations and correcting the measured absorbance using the ratio of the solution volume at any current state of the system to its initial volume 100 ml after each addition of naoh or metal stock the solutions were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min prior to the removal of 15 ml aliquots for the acquisition of the absorbance spectrum the aliquots were then added back to the solutions prior to the next addition of metal ions hclo4 or naoh titration the absorbance spectra were recorded using a hitachi u 3900uv vis spectrophotometer with a 5 cm cell at

binding properties of the dom were quantified based on the revised non ideal competitive adsorption nica model gao et al 2015 yan et al 2016b the engagement of phenolic and carboxylic chromophores in dom samples before and after ultrasound can be modeled using equation 3 that has been utilized in prior research to interpret the data of spectrophotometric titrations gao et al 2015 yan et al 2014b

discussion 3 1 the performance of ultrasound the effect of the ultrasound power on the srfa and aha solutions were investigated the performance of srfa was similar to that of aha in general but it would be obviously carbonized at high ultrasound powers 360 w the results of aha were shown in fig 1 as an example the results of srfa were shown in fig s1 in supporting information si section the concentration of doc decreased slightly with the increase of the ultrasound power fig 1a which was consistent with previous research naddeo et al 2007 zúñiga benítez et al 2015 meanwhile the turbidity

equation 1 and were shown in fig 2 there are several peaks located at ca 245 280 320 and 380 nm that could be found in the das of srfa yan et al 2014c the appearance of these bands may be due to the changes of the electron distribution before and after protonation deprotonation and or other non specific effects associated with deprotonation could induce the changes of inter chromophore

study dslope350 400 was calculated using equation 2 and applied to examine the extent of changes of protonation active functionalities in dom before and after ultrasound the evolution of the dslope350 400 values of srfa and aha as a function of ph were shown in fig 3 it indicates that ultrasound has obvious effects on the protonation deprotonation properties of dom chromophores for both srfa and aha the increase of ultrasound power led to a gradual decrease of the value of the dslope350 400 the data were further interpreted by a revised nica model to quantify the amount of carboxylic like and phenolic like functional groups in dom benedetti et al 1995 kinniburgh et al 1999 as shown in fig 3 the experimental data could be described well by the revised nica for both srfa and aha at various ultrasound powers typical r2 0 99 the parameters applied in the revised nica model for each set were shown in table 1 the amount of carboxylic like groups in the dom tended to decrease with the increase of the ultrasound power except for aha at high ultrasound power 480 w while the amount of phenolic like groups had a certain degree of increase except for aha at high ultrasound power 480 w

ritchie and perdue 2003 especially given that aha is a chemical humic substance with a high molecular weight and complicated composition the removal rate of carboxylic groups 38 96 at 480 w in aha was lower than that of srfa 79 00 at 240 w and the rate of increase of phenolic groups 26 30 at 480 w was higher than that of srfa 16 50 at 240 w aha is mainly composed of macromolecules and oh radicals formed under ultrasound could decompose them to form small molecules and phenolic like groups kotronarou et al 1991 resulting in a significant increase in the phenolic like groups in aha while srfa is mainly composed of small molecules and oh radicals could further oxidize srfa resulting in the carboxylic groups being significantly decomposed they would be carbonized if the experiment was carried out at high ultrasound power 240 w 3 3 influence of ultrasound on the metal ion binding properties of srfa and aha the effects of ultrasound on the interactions between dom and metal ions ca ii and al iii were further explored the das results of srfa caused by ca ii and al iii binding were shown in fig 4 as an example the data for aha were shown in fig s2 in si for the two examined metal ions ca ii and al iii peaks with maxima located at ca 245 280 320 and 380 nm could be found which was consistent with the result of ph das shown above as well as the results in the literature yan and korshin 2014 meanwhile the relative intensities of each peak were different between ca ii and al iii resulting in the different shapes of these differential spectra for ca ii and al iii especially in the low wavelength range 300 nm the metal specific feature in das demonstrates the discrete functionalities and structures of dom to interact with metal ions yan and korshin 2014 the ultrasound had no significant influence on the shape of the das caused by ca ii and al iii binding but the intensity of the das caused by ca ii and al iii binding obviously decreased with the increase of ultrasound power especially for ca ii in prior literature yan et al 2013b 2014b 2014c 2015 2016b it has been demonstrated that the spectral parameter dslope350 400 has good linear correlation with the metals bound onto dom including ca ii and al iii accordingly we used the dslope350 400 values measured at varying concentrations of ca ii and al iii to quantify the amounts of metal bound onto the dom before and after ultrasound the results for srfa and aha were shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively as shown in fig 5 the dslope350 400 value increased with increases in the concentrations of both total ca ii and al iii but the changes in the dslope350 400 value of ca ii were one order lower than those of al although its concentration was two orders higher than that of al iii with the increase of ultrasound power the dslope350 400 values decreased for both ca ii and al iii especially at a high ultrasound power of 240 w and high concentrations of ca ii as shown in fig 6 the aha was similar to srfa in that the dslope350 400 value increased with the increases in both the total ca ii and al iii concentrations but the changes in the dslope350 400 of aha caused by ca ii and al iii were comparable when the concentration of ca ii was two orders higher than that of al iii the effect of ultrasound on the dslope350 400 values was slight at 60 w but it was more obvious for both ca ii and al iii at a high ultrasound power of 480 w especially for al iii the different trends between ca ii and al iii reflect the different mechanisms of their interactions with dom samples according to the nica donnan model most of the metal ions bound to dom can be operationally attributed to binding onto carboxylic and phenolic functional groups and they participate in non discrete donnan gel electrostatic interactions benedetti et al 1995 kinniburgh et al 1999 al iii shows a higher ability than ca ii to bind onto dom and the dominant al dom binding is with phenolic like groups meanwhile besides the non discrete donnan gel electrostatic interactions the dominant fraction of bound ca ii is carboxylic ca based on the results above regarding functional groups it is reasonable that the amount of the ca ii decrease is significant for srfa as there is a significant decrease in carboxylic like groups in the case of aha the content of phenolic like groups decreases at high ultrasound power which leads to the bound al decreasing more obviously than for srfa 4 conclusion 1 the effects of ultrasound on the changes in proton binding moieties in dom at environmentally relevant concentrations were determined using the das approach the engagement of proton binding moieties of dom was well quantified by the revised non ideal competitive adsorption nica model it demonstrates that the concentration of carboxylic groups decreased with the increase of ultrasound power and the concentration of the operationally defined phenolic groups increased with the increase of ultrasound power expect for aha at high ultrasound power 480 w 2 the amounts of bound metal ions ca ii and al iii before and after ultrasound could be quantified by the das approach and they decreased with the decrease in the available total binding sites carboxylic like and phenolic like groups in dom after ultrasound 3 the approach presented in this study provides in situ information concerning the
