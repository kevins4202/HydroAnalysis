15100,we analyzed the impacts of land use land cover types on carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 concentration and diffusion in 1st to 4th strahler order tributaries of the longchuan river to the upper yangtze river in china by using headspace equilibration method and co2sys program field sampling and measurements were conducted during the dry and wet seasons from 2017 to 2019 the average of calculated co2 partial pressure pco2 mean sd 2389 3220 μatm by co2sys program was 1 9 fold higher than the value mean sd 1230 1440 μatm 10 years ago in the longchuan river basin where the urban land area increased by a factor of 7 times further analysis showed that corrected pco2 by headspace method and dissolved ch4 dch4 decrease as the stream order and flow velocity increase the pco2 and dch4 in the wet season was lower than that in the dry season the explanatory ability of land use types on the variation of corrected pco2 and dch4 was stronger at the reach scale than at the riparian and catchment scales in two seasons urban land at reach scale further showed much higher explanation on corrected pco2 and dch4 than cropland grassland and forest land in the wet season the longchuan river emits approximately 112 5 kt co2 c and 1 0 kt ch4 c per year being 1 7 fold of the total lateral export of dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic carbon 68 3 kt c y 1 the findings highlight

transporting terrigenous carbon c to the marine system but function as a complex processor that transform store and release large amounts of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 gases into the atmosphere cole et al 2007 stanley et al 2016 the global estimates of riverine co2 emission vary largely from 0 2 pg c y 1 to 2 2 pg c y 1 cole et al 2007 lauerwald et al 2015 li et al 2021a raymond et al 2013 sawakuchi et al 2020 and there is an even much wider range of riverine ch4 outgassing estimates from 2 tg ch4 y 1 to 30 3 tg ch4 y 1 bastviken et al 2011 li et al 2021a stanley et al 2016 the increasing field data of riverine co2 and ch4 emissions caused the revised estimated numbers li et al 2021a sawakuchi et al 2020 low order streams comprising the greatest stream length in a river basin downing et al 2012 have been found to have higher partial pressure of co2 pco2 and dissolved ch4 concentrations dch4 borges et al 2019 brigham et al 2019 teodoru et al 2015 being a disproportional contributor to riverine c emission li et al 2021a marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 under emphasis of carbon cycles of low order stream ecosystems can cause large uncertainties in global carbon budget marx et al 2017 hence more field observations of co2 and ch4 emission particularly from low order streams can help a better evaluation of local and global c budgets from river systems low order streams are experiencing rapid changes in nutrient enrichment and carbon dynamics gu et al 2022 tang et al 2021b as world s population continues to increase and urban development continues progressing with the development of global urbanization the increasingly intensified human activities have caused land use changes with encroachment of urbanized terrain on cropland cropland exploitation and reclamation of forest han et al 2017 which drastically influence structures and functions of river ecosystem allan 2004 meyer et al 2005 in rivers strongly affected by human activities carbon dynamics in the river water can be regulated in several ways li et al 2022a zhang et al 2023 changes in land use land cover lulc can accelerate chemical weathering and erosion causing more carbonate and bicarbonate ions entering adjacent streams chetelat et al 2008 hartmann et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 which are a major source of carbon contributing to the total dissolved carbon telmer and veizer 1999 zeng and masiello 2010 point source and non point source pollutants induced by urban development and agricultural practices can increase nutrient and carbon loadings to the adjacent riverine systems affecting aquatic biogeochemical processing blann et al 2009 li et al 2009 tang et al 2019 also increased nutrient loadings exert complex effects on the balance between co2 production and consumption as well as other greenhouse gases jia et al 2019 li et al 2020b organic carbon level could enhance microbial degradation modifying in stream production of co2 and ch4 ballester et al 1999 howarth et al 1992 wang et al 2021 the oxidation of dch4 due to methane oxidizing bacteria through aerobic and anaerobic processes would lead to an increase in pco2 but a decrease in dch4 borges et al 2019 deutzmann et al 2014 in addition sewage discharge and effluents from wastewater treatment plants may contain a large amount of dissolved co2 and ch4 alshboul et al 2016 smith et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 low order streams dominate a riverine landscape and support the ecological functions of downstream systems vannote et al 1980 due to relatively smaller size and higher edge to water volume ratios low order streams are more susceptible to the impacts of terrestrial inputs induced by land use changes de mello et al 2018 ding et al 2016 gu et al 2022 multi scale investigation has been made to analyze the influence of lulc over river condition the spatial scales of lulc are measured at reach riparian and catchment scales and their clear differences are articulated as follows 1 reach is often defined as a buffer of several hundred meters in width and length above a sampling site 2 riparian is usually described as a specific area along the each side surrounding a river channel but extending to the entire upstream above a site 3 catchment is the entire catchment upstream of a site allan 2004 shi et al 2017 previous studies have emphasized that co2 and ch4 are largely driven by the terrestrial contribution within a certain residence length crawford et al 2014 leng et al 2021 for example crawford et al 2014 found that stream co2 decreases to almost complete depletion within 1400 m downstream without addition and the ch4 residence length is relatively shorter the scale largely depends on the gas transfer properties and flow velocity e g 3u k where u is the flow velocity and k is the gas exchange coefficient demars et al 2015 meanwhile the variation of the scale effects is definitely related to the topography precipitation and connectivity between riparian wetland and stream channel borges et al 2019 lambert et al 2016 leng et al 2021 for example the larger submerged riparian area caused the higher ch4 in the stream characterized by smoother hills compared to stream characterized by steeper hills during the rainy season leng et al 2021 several recent studies have reported the relationship between lulc and riverine c gases i e co2 and ch4 borges et al 2018 tang et al 2021b wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 but few studies have investigated the scale effects of lulc on fluvial c gases seasonality gu et al 2022 understanding their interactions in low order streams is essential for addressing the challenge of accurate estimation of stream c emission regional c balance and mitigation to global climate change to improve our understanding we conducted five field campaigns in measuring riverine pco2 and dch4 at 34 locations distributed in the 1st to 4th order steams of the longchuan river basin a headwater area of the upper yangtze river this area has been under rapid urbanization development in the last two decades two previous studies reported pco2 levels in the river computed with the co2sys software li et al 2012 ni et al 2020 and these modeling estimates have not never been validated furthermore the studies did not analyze dch4 variation as well as the responses of pco2 and dch4 to the lulc conditions in the drainage area in this study we aimed to 1 investigate the spatial temporal variability of pco2 dch4 and their diffusive fluxes as well as compare pco2 level with that of ten years before 2 examine the influence of scale effects of lulc on fluvial pco2 and dch4 and 3 identify the controls of variability and coupling relationships among pco2 dch4 and ambient factors the gases have an ordinary property of rapid gas exchange demars et al 2015 and the streams are generally well aerated stanley et al 2016 so that the effect of upstream and surrounding lulc is thought to be limited to small scales therefore we intended to test the hypothesis that the lulc had scale effects with stronger influence on riverine c gases at smaller reach scale than larger riparian or catchment scale in low order streams the findings gained from this study provide insights into the effects of lulc and hydrological factors on dissolved c gases 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in the longchuan river basin lcr 24 49 26 14 n 100 58 102 4 e strahler order 5 in southwest china the river is a headwater tributary of the yangtze river located in chuxiong yi autonomous prefecture of yunnan province fig 1 the drainage basin is about 9256 km2 in a longitudinal range gorge region with a main channel length of 246 km this area has high average cumulative sunshine hours of 2549 h and is characterized by a sub tropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 14 8 21 9 fig s1 the annual average precipitation is 800 1000 mm with 86 94 of the total precipitation occurring during may october wet season fig s1 except for the lower basin area yuanmou county which has a dry hot climate characterized by lower rainfall 610 mm and serious soil erosion zhou et al 2004 the discharge of the lcr is controlled by catchment precipitation leading to more than 80 of total stream flow occurring in the wet season xu and zang 2011 topography of the river basin is characterized by mountains and hills with the highest elevation of 3000 m and the lowest 700 m the parent rocks are triassic shales and sandstone with small proportion of granite limestone and quaternary deposits with abundant carbonates in the drainage basin he et al 2010 the area is dominated by purple soil classified as regosols in the food and agriculture organization fao taxonomy which is very susceptible to water erosion and weathering li et al 2012 since the chinese central government promotes a west development strategy that intends to modernize the region the urbanization rate and urban population have increased from 20 3 and 0 52 million to 46 5 and 0 87 million in the chuxiong yi autonomous prefecture in the last two decades respectively https www hongheiku com meanwhile the lulc types have changed for example the percentage of urban has a seven fold increase from 0 3 in 2009 to 2 3 in 2017 while cropland increases in downstream and decreases in upstream with no changed percentage in the lcr basin fig 2 and table s1 river water quality was affected by point source and non point source pollutants cheng et al 2020 li et al 2021b accordingly local government has carried out a number of ecological and environmental protection projects such as designation of natural protection areas construction of new wastewater treatment plants and improvement of sewage pipe networks 2 2 sampling and analyses five field measurement and sampling were performed at 34 locations in the 1st 4th streams of the lcr basin during the dry season 21 25 january in 2018 and 18 25 april in 2019 and the wet season 13 18 may and 12 16 september in 2017 and 20 24 september in 2019 figs 1 and s1 data from 2017 2019 guaranteed the necessary data of inter annual repetition experiment and seasonal differences among them 21 sampling sites were in the tributaries and 13 sampling sites were in the mainstem fig 1 during sampling period the wet season accounts for 79 to 98 of the annual rainfall 312 904 mm in the mouding county which is the center area in the longchuan river catchment fig s1 the amount of monthly precipitation in the sampling month was 15 8 mm may 2017 23 1 mm september 2017 and 84 8 mm september 2019 in the wet season while 4 7 mm january 2017 and 5 3 mm april 2019 in the dry season in stream measurements on ph water temperature twater dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were performed using an multiparameter water quality probe pcd 650 thermo fisher eutech singapore streamflow velocity v was measured with a current meter ls300a china or float method ni et al 2020 air temperature tair was measured by anemometer testo 410 1 testo se co kgaa titisee neustadt germany atmospheric pressure at the sampling was also recorded using a barometer water samples were collected about 10 cm below the surface water and were filtered with whatman gf f 0 7 μm pore size on the sampling days the filtered samples were stored in 100 ml high density polyethylene hdpe containers for chemical analysis and the filters were used for determining chlorophyll a chl a and total suspended solid tss concentrations total alkalinity ta was determined by a fixed end point titration method with 0 0200 mol l hcl on the sampling day all samples were immediately transported with ice boxes to the lab for refrigeration

based on the china national standard http datacenter mee gov cn the chl a concentration was determined by the acetone extraction method total suspended solid tss was measured following zhang et al 2020a and kao and liu 1996 the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed with a toc analyzer multi n c 2100s toc tn jena germany in each field sampling riverine pco2 was calculated by co2sys program with ph water temperature and ta regarding the two field samplings during 2019 surface water pco2 and dch4 were also measured by the headspace equilibration method herreid et al 2021 ortega et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 briefly 40 ml of water samples were collected in a 60 ml gas tight syringe from a depth of about 10 cm below the surface and equilibrated with 20 ml volume of atmospheric air after vigorous shaking to promote equilibration headspace gas was injected into a pre evacuated glass nichiden rika glass co ltd japan atmospheric co2 and ch4 concentrations were concurrently collected for analysis duplicate or three replicates were analyzed throughout the study the headspace air was analyzed by gas chromatograph gc clarus 580 perkinelmer usa with 10 ppmv ch4 and 349 6 ppmv co2 for concentration verification check up the original water pco2 μatm and dch4 nmol l 1 were then calculated according to the temperature and headspace ratio using henry s law johnson et al 1990 weiss 1974 as follows 1 p c o 2 c g c r t v g v w c g c c a c k h c 2 d c h 4 c g m r t k h m v g v w c g m c a m 3 ln k h c 58 0931 90 5069 100 t 22 2940 ln t 100 4 k h m β 22 356

117 24212 μatm linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between calculated pco2 with co2sys program and measured pco2 with the headspace equilibration method abril et al 2015 has suggested that overestimation of calculated pco2 with respect to measured pco2 are link to the contribution of organic acids to the total alkalinity in view the difference of average concentration of doc between two seasons table 2 the observed calculated pco2 from the dry season and wet season was fit separately and the formula with the highest coefficient of determination r2 was chosen for further analysis a model between calculated pco2 and measured pco2 was developed with logarithmic transformation of the data dry season measured pco2 23 5e1 2288 log calculated p co 2 r2 0 73 n 31 p 0 001 wet season measured pco2 6 853 log calculated pco2 4 3296 r2 0 87 n 34 p 0 001 fig s2 this function was then used to correct possible bias of calculated pco2 the corrected pco2 abbreviated to pco2 data are scrutinized with an exclusion of two maxima and was consequently used for the latter analysis these two maxima in the dry season were perhaps the results of occasional leakage of domestic sewage and low streamflow velocity 0 or 0 01 m s 1 in two sampling sites when compared with the reported riverine pco2 data from co2sys program calculated pco2 in this study was adopted to avoid potential methodological bias 2 3 water air co2 and ch4 diffusive fluxes co2 and ch4 diffusive flux f mmol m 2 d 1 was estimated by the thin boundary layer tbl model as follows 6 f k c water c atm 7 k

order in our studied streams k600 models from small rivers in the amazon and mekong basin see eq 9 alin et al 2011 and usa see eq 10 raymond et al 2012 were used for obtaining reliable and reasonable k600 values in view of the similar ecological stress from soil erosion and the range of weed speed in the lcr basin wind speed ranged from 0 to 2 4 m s 1 and yellow river basin wind speed ranged from 0 9 to 2 8 m s 1 eqs 11 13 from yellow river basin ran et al 2017a ran et al 2015 were also used for the estimation of k600 to help generate the likely magnitude of co2 and ch4 areal estimates since eq 12 and eq 13 were respectively from the spring dry season and summer wet season ran et al 2017a they were also used for the estimation of k600 in the dry and wet seasons respectively in river system gas transfer velocity has classically been modeled based on physical characteristics such as streamflow velocity stream depth discharge and slope alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 these k600 models provide the possibility of estimating fluxes across broad regions where no direct measurements are available borges et al 2019 looman et al 2021 but different k600 models could yield different estimates of fluxes wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 multiple models that are recommended for rivers with the characteristics as the lcr e g channels 100 m wide low stream order and similar ecological issues can help generate the likely magnitude of co2 and ch4 areal estimates for all sampling streams in two seasons 2 4 spatial data the strahler stream order was extracted from the hydroriver dataset https www hydrosheds org lulc types were analyzed using the remote sensing data with 10 m resolution in 2017 gong et al 2019 fig 2b and 30 m resolution in 2009 yang and huang 2021 fig 2a the digital elevation model dem data for the study area was obtained from china s geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca and lulc types in 2017 was used to evaluate the importance of the spatial extent on the lulc effects on dissolved c gases concentration the presentations of seven spatial scales of lulc in 2017 are shown in fig 2c and fig s3 different scales of lulc were extracted at the reach riparian scales of 500 1000 1500 m and the catchment scale ding et al 2016 shi et al 2017 for reach scale of 500 m 500 m upstream the sampling site was considered to be the geographical center and a circle with radius of 500 m was created similar method was used to obtain the reach scale of 1000 1500 m for riparian scale a band width of 500 1000 1500 m on each side extending to the entire upstream above sampling sites was analyzed the catchment scale included the entire catchment upstream the monitoring site 2 5 data quality and uncertainty the average value is expressed in the form of mean standard deviation sd multi parameter water quality probes of ph do and ec were calibrated prior to measurement and have relative precision of 0 002 ph units 0 5 c 2 0 and 1 respectively the relative error of replicated measuring of nutrients was below 5 doc concentrations were determined in triplicate with coefficient of variance 2 ph values were generally neutral or basic with a range of 7 09 9 15 fig s4a excluding two acidic ph values measured in the streams draining paddy fields or rubbish dump the high ta 2640 1896 µeq l 1 measured in all river samples indicated that water was carbonate buffered due to the abundant carbonate rocks in streams fig s4b doc tdn and tdp averaged 4 77 1 70 mg l 1 2 06 3 21 mg l 1 and 0 62 1 35 mg l 1 could result in a small proportion of organic acids anions and non carbonated alkalinity which could contribute to the overestimation of the calculated pco2 abril et al 2015 hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 regarding measured pco2 koschorreck et al 2021 indicated that increasing water headspace ratio e g 2 1 was adopted in this study and using air as headspace can significantly reduce the magnitude of error in headspace method therefore the headspace used could limit the uncertainty photosynthesis imparts a daily cycle on riverine pco2 clow et al 2021 li et al 2020b unfortunately we could not determine the diurnal variations and correct co2 measures affected by sampling time however we sampled running waters and avoided the time 12 00 am to 14 00 pm with intensive light and high temperature field measurements during the day may cause underestimate of riverine pco2 and co2 fluxes which were 1 2 1 8 times lower than the values at night in some rivers zhang et al 2020b for ch4 the diffusion reported here was considered conservative in view of other pathways such as ebullition via bubbles mcginnis et al 2016 wang et al 2021 and plant mediated emission via vascular plants stanley et al 2016 were not included 2 6 statistical analyses all data were checked for normality and homogeneity using the shapiro wilk and levene s test and the results showed that most of them were not normally distributed the mann whitney test was used to assess whether the spatial and seasonal variables were significantly different ibm spss statistics 24 the redundancy analysis rda was used to examine the explanation of lulc in multiple spatial scales on pco2 and dch4 using canoco 5 software a spearman rank correlation analysis was employed to detect relationships between pco2 dch4 lulc types on different scales and physicochemical parameters originpro 2021 the explanatory ability of ambient environmental variables on pco2 and dch4 were explored using stepwise multiple linear regression mlr by ibm spss statistics 24 a significance level of p at 0 05 was used the full dataset is available in the table s4 and table s5 in the supplementary document 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations of pco2 and dch4 and their diffusive fluxes pco2 varied from 159 μatm to 6591 μatm with an average of 1266 990 μatm in the lcr fig 3 a and table 1 the average of pco2 was 1 2 times higher in the dry season than in the wet season 1401 1214 μatm vs 1182 816 μatm p 0 05 table 1 fluvial dch4 spanned more than two orders of magnitude from 12 nmol l 1 to 5801 nmol l 1 with an average of 749 1115 nmol l 1 fig 3b and table 1 similar to pco2 the average of dch4 was significantly i e 2 2 times higher in the dry season than in the wet season 1092 1410 nmol l 1 vs 456 677 nmol l 1 p 0 01 table 1 the means of pco2 and dch4 decreased with increased stream order with the highest value 2357 1732 μatm 2010 2942 nmol l 1 occurring in the 1st order streams and the lowest value 842 676 μatm 411 692 nmol l 1 in the 4th order streams figs 3c and 3d pco2 was observed to show significant differences among 1st order 2nd order and 4th order streams fig 3c the average of k600 calculated from the five models ranged 7 3 cm h 1 to 640 7 cm h 1 with an average of 45 5 sd 57 1 cm h 1 comparable to the means 45 5 cm h 1 or 42 5 cm h 1 calculated from eq 9 in the daning river ni et al 2019 and measured by chambers in small tributaries mean sd 48 4 53 2 cm h 1 li et al 2019 in the upper yangtze river the k600 value was between the two values 8 cm h 1 and 59 8 cm h 1 reported by previous studies in the lcr however k600 for this study was clearly higher than the value used for global rivers 20 8 cm h 1 calculated from eq 10 raymond et al 2013 and the measured value in small rivers of usa 19 6 cm h 1 raymond et al 2012 therefore direct k600 measurements are recommended to further refine the k600 for flux estimation the k600 calculated from five models showed that the average of all k600 in dry season was lower than that in the wet season 41 1 54 3 cm h 1 vs 48 2 58 8 cm h 1 p 0 05 table 1 on the contrary estimated co2 flux fco2 and ch4 flux fch4 in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the wet season fco2 335 4 518 9 mmol m 2 d 1 vs 283 7 433 7 mmol m 2 d 1 fch4 3 6 3 9 mmol m 2 d 1 vs 1 7 2 5 mmol m 2 d 1 p 0 01 table 1 in the lcr catchment estimated fco2 ranged from 234 0 mmol m 2 d 1 to 6065 8 mmol m 2 d 1 with an average of 303 4 468 3 mmol m 2 d 1 table 1 4 i e 6 samples of 161 sampling river segments showed the sink of atmospheric co2 and 4 samples were in the dry season the average of fch4 was estimated at 2 6 3 4 mmol m 2 d 1 ranging from 0 03 mmol m 2 d 1 to 19 2 mmol m 2 d 1 in the basin table 1 all sampling river segments were the source of atmospheric ch4 3 2 relationship of pco2 and dch4 with land use patterns on different scales the rda results showed the spatial scale effects of lulc on pco2 and dch4 fig 4 the higher total variation in pco2 and dch4 could be explained by land use types at the reach scales moreover the explanatory ability of land use types decreased when the scales were enlarged to riparian and catchment the urban land at reach scale 500 m can respectively explain 5 3 and 12 1 simple effect of variation of pco2 and dch4 during the dry season and wet season but the explanation of urban land decreased to 2 4 and 3 6 in catchment scale respectively the explanatory ability of lulc on stream c gases was relatively higher in the wet season than that in the dry season accordingly pco2 was positively correlated with the percentages of urban land and cropland on the reach scale of 1000 1500 m and dch4 was positively correlated with the percentage of urban land on the reach scale of 500 m during the dry season p 0 05 fig 5 a in the wet season pco2 was positively correlated with the proportion of urban land at reach scales of 500 1000 1500 m and riparian scales of 500 1000 m p 0 05 fig 5a 3 3 relationship of pco2 and dch4 with physicochemical factors seasonal variations of physicochemical parameters are presented in table 2 there were significant differences in twater do doc tdn tdp nh4 n and tss between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 with higher averages of twater do doc tdn nh4 n and tss in the wet season the spearman s correlations among pco2 dch4 and physicochemical factors are shown in fig 5b pco2 and dch4 were negatively correlated with streamflow velocity and ph in the two seasons and negatively correlated with do and positively correlated with doc and tdp in the wet season p 0 05 significant positive relationship between pco2 and dch4 was observed in the wet season r 0 68 p 0 01 but not in the dry season fig 5b multiple regressions showed that the variation of pco2 could be explained by grassland at catchment scale and ec in the dry season r2 0 42 p 0 01 but doc and twater in the wet season r2 0 23 p 0 05 fig 6 a for dch4 tdp ph and grassland at reach scale of 1000 1500 m were the powerful predictors for dch4 in the wet season r2 0 70 p 0 01 fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 the roles of riverine hydrologic factors the riverine concentrations of c gases are a multiple consequence of degassing endogenous metabolism and external inputting driven by hydrologic factors liu and greaver 2009 stanley et al 2016 stream order or size is generally considered to be an important hydrologic control on riverine pco2 and dch4 pco2 and dch4 were found to be highest in 1st order streams and to decrease with increasing steam order in line with recent previous studies borges et al 2019 li et al 2021a wallin et al 2018 the directly co2 and ch4 input via groundwater benthic carbon degradation and leaching from riparian soil respiration could be assumed to be the important sources that resulted in high pco2 and dch4 in headwater streams hotchkiss et al 2015 jones and mulholland 1998 marx et al 2017 for example marescaux et al 2018 found that pco2 in the groundwater can reached up 65000 µtm and be 5 10 times higher than the surface water on the contrary the increasing discharge and decreasing ratio of edge to water volume could reduce the percentage of co2 and ch4 input from groundwater and soil respiration in higher order rivers li et al 2021a this implies that pco2 and dch4 in low order streams are higher than that in high order main stem streamflow velocity mediated by climate and the channel geomorphologic features is a critical driver on riverine pco2 and dch4 by affecting the degassing rate of dissolved gas raymond et al 2012 and biogeochemical processing i e balance between c gases production and consumption mitrovic et al 2011 ward et al 2018 for example the riverine co2 almost completely outgassed and approached atmospheric equilibrium as the river plunges down over victoria falls teodoru et al 2015 in addition increasing streamflow velocity can lead to reduced hydraulic retention time and thus rapid hydrological cycling which is unfavorable to the co2 consumption by photosynthesis cotovicz et al 2015 xia et al 2019 the mentioned process i e hydraulic control on pco2 was evidenced by findings of the negative relationship between streamflow velocity and pco2 fig 5b the negative relationship between dch4 and streamflow velocity fig 5b is in line with the findings in rivers in the skogaryd research catchment sweden natchimuthu et al 2017 and northern quebec canada campeau and del giorgio 2014 this is linked to degassing rate of dissolved gas and highly sensibility of methanogenic and methane oxidation to do enhanced by turbulence liu and whitman 2008 stanley et al 2016 as reflected by their negative relationship fig 5b therefore the higher streamflow velocity table 2 could be a potential driver of the lower concentrations of c gases in the wet season than that in the dry season in the lcr 4 2 effects of land use land cover types urban and cropland are considered as intense human activities that directly or indirectly affect pco2 and dch4 in the rivers first cropland and urban land can lead to the enrichment of nutrients in adjacent rivers during the expansion and development process thereby accelerating the production of co2 and ch4 and carbon loss of river ecosystem raymond et al 2008 rosemond et al 2015 wang et al 2021 in addition chemical weathering enhanced by agricultural activities e g fertilization transition reclamation can enhance export of carbonate alkalinity from soils to rivers subsequently fueling the riverine pco2 li et al 2020a raymond and cole 2003 second rivers draining urban and cultivated area are influenced by untreated domestic sewage effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp and leaching from soil which are not only bring nutrients and organic matter to rivers but also contain high levels of co2 and ch4 jin et al 2018 jones and mulholland 1998 marwick et al 2014 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 on the contrary grassland or forest area could reduce pollutants and carbon input from terrestrial sources borken et al 2003 de souza et al 2013 leading to lower pco2 and dch4 as well as pollutant concentration in rivers bodmer et al 2016 borges et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the surface runoff caused by rainfall and overflow of sewage pipes can make urban land an important contributor to pollution loadings in rivers during the wet season chen et al 2016 paul and meyer 2001 smith et al 2017 this is verified by the fact that the higher explanatory ability of urban land on variation of physicochemical parameters than cropland in the wet season table s2 the more contribution of urban land to the riverine c gases was also observed in the wet season which is reflective to the different correlation of pco2 with lulc between the two seasons fig 5a the extent of influence from cropland on river is associated with the tillage management and geographic characteristics gu et al 2019 for example paddy land had a much stronger effect on water quality and riverine ch4 than dry cropland wu et al 2019 field survey showed the dominant dry cropland around the sampling sites 4 3 scale effects of land use land cover the overall variation of pco2 and dch4 was explained better by reach scales than by riparian or catchment scale land use types as indicated by the positive relationship between urban land or cropland at reach scales and pco2 or dch4 this scale effects are similar to the land use influence on water quality ding et al 2016 pratt and chang 2012 for example urban land displayed a stronger positive correlation with degraded water quality at small scales shi et al 2017 and water quality e g water temperature chl a ec nh4 n in the mountainous catchments was best explained by land use at reach scale ding et al 2016 this is likely because the effect of conversion of natural vegetation into urban land and cropland is greater along the river in mountainous area fig 2b as reflected by the acutely decreasing percentage of urban and cropland from reach scale to watershed scale fig s3b furthermore the solubility degassing and oxidation characteristics of gases in water may also affect the scale effect of lulc for example the solubility of ch4 in water is very low and ch4 is easy to be oxidized and outgassed in a short distance i e 10 1000 m as water moves downstream stanley et al 2016 this may explain that ch4 is positively related with urban land only on reach scale of 500 m in the dry season fig 6b as regards co2 the balance between production and consumption is changeable longitudinally thereby affecting co2 concentration at larger scales the hydrological connectivity between terrestrial lands and stream channel would be better in the wet season so the effect of lulc would become more prominent for the riverine c gases in wet seasons bracken and croke 2007 leng et al 2021 we found the terrestrial effect is expectedly larger in the wet season than that in the dry season this is supported by the higher explanatory ability of lulc on the c gases in the wet season the scale of the highest explanatory ability of lulc on stream c gases enlarges from reach scale of 1000 m during the dry season to 1500 m during the wet season fig 4 precipitation can activate flow paths that is absent in the dry season and also accelerate streamflow velocity cohen et al 2016 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 previous studies reported that the connectivity of river with flooded forest wetland and floodplain areas during the wet season could drive higher riverine pco2 and dch4 because of external inputs of enormous c gases and organic carbon abril et al 2014 borges et al 2019 on the contrary we observed the higher averages of pco2 and dch4 in the dry season in the lcr in our sampling area there are not lateral wetlands or other water bodies e g lakes the contribution from hydrological connectivity may be confined from riparian sterile soil in the lcr catchment with steep terrain leng et al 2021 in addition concentrated rainfall can have a dilution effect particularly in the catchment with steep terrain showing rapid hydrological cycling therefore during the wet season the combination of the diluting effect of concentrated precipitation fig s1 and the influence of accelerated c gases degassing induced by higher gas transfer velocity table 2 overcome the promotional effect of lateral inputs resulting in the lower riverine pco2 and dch4 4 4 the roles of riverine physicochemical factors increasing nutrient elements and organic carbon inputs would elevate the respiration rate accompanied by the depletion of o2 and increase of pco2 for example the respiration rate in the river downstream receiving sewage and waste water is three times higher than the average found in the upstream with less pollution in the piracicaba river ballester et al 1999 dissolved ch4 concentration generally represents the result of methanogenesis since the decomposition of organic matter mainly under anoxic conditions liu and whitman 2008 therefore dissolved oxygen and organic carbon are vital drivers of riverine pco2 and dch4 as it is also reflected in the negative relation of pco2 and dch4 with stream do and the positive relation with doc found in the wet season fig 5b implying the potential biological control on pco2 and dch4 on the other hand intense carbonate weathering process in the lcr catchment of the longitudinal ridge valley area he et al 2010 could be an important source of pco2 in the dry season similar to the seasonal variation of pco2 in the tigris river turkey with karst carbonate rocks in the basin due to diluting effect of higher discharge by concentrated precipitation reflected in the lower ec table 2 and the more contribution from urban land to pollution loading in the wet season the proportion of pco2 from chemical weathering may decrease while the proportion of pco2 that was associated with biological metabolism may increase this is consistent with previous observation that the percentage of 12c enriched dic co2 from soil respiration and organic matter oxidation increased during the wet season in the mun river li et al 2022b therefore pco2 showed significant correlation with do doc tdp and nh4 n in the wet season but these close linkages were not observed in the dry season fig 5b this was also well reflected in that the variation of pco2 was positively explained by ec in the dry season while by doc and twater in the wet season fig 6a ch4 can be readily oxidized to co2 in the oxygen rich rivers shelley et al 2015 stanley et al 2016 which may have contributed to the significant positive relationship between dch4 and pco2 in the wet season with higher do level fig 5b table 2 such relations have been observed in other studies for instance in the meuse river belgium borges et al 2018 some urban rivers in baltimore united states smith et al 2017 borges et al 2018b speculated that the two gases may have had the same source such as the overflow of sewage pipes and leaching from soil resulted from precipitation li et al 2012 smith et al 2017 similar to pco2 the variation of dch4 could be positively explained by tdp in the wet season fig 6 however our finding that no significant relationship between dch4 and pco2 exist in the dry season fig 5b may suggest that dch4 and pco2 likely have different sources 4 5 importance of pco2 and dch4 and diffusive fluxes the average 2389 3220 μatm of calculated pco2 is 1 9 times more than the previous average value 1230 1440 μatm calculated using co2sys in the lcr during 2008 2009 where only one sampling site xiaohekou hydrological station in upstream of mainstem was included li et al 2012 this difference is partly due to the increased percentage of urban land fig 2 and table s1 and partly to the higher pco2 in headwater tributaries than the main stem included in this study fig 3c compared with daning river 1198 μatm calculated by co2sys program another tributary of the upper yangtze river the average calculated pco2 in the lcr is almost 2 times higher ni et al 2019 this may be related to the decreased pco2 by enhanced photosynthesis resulting from the development of cascade reservoirs in the daning river however the calculated pco2 and the pco2 1334 1389 μatm corrected by headspace equilibration method in the lcr is lower than the average value of several larger rivers i e the yangtze river 2662 1240 μatm calculated by co2sys program ran et al 2017b and amazon river system 3929 μatm calculated with ph and alkalinity lauerwald et al 2015 which can be attributed to different pollution loads chen et al 2020b and hydrologic connectivity with wetland abril et al 2014 respectively for example water quality e g biochemical oxygen demand nh4 n and tp of the upper reaches of the yangtze river was better than that in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river chen et al 2020b the measured dch4 749 1115 nmol l 1 in the low order streams of the lcr is comparable to previous measurements in suburban rural rivers or reaches such as tributaries of hudson river 633 93 nmol l 1 usa brigham et al 2019 and tributaries in the upper reaches of yangtze river 764 708 nmol l 1 china tang et al 2021b but the average of dch4 is lower than values found in seriously polluted rivers draining highly urbanized landscapes for example xiaoyue river in beijing 5400 nmol l 1 china wang et al 2020 and urban tributary of han river south korea 2327 nmol l 1 jin et al 2018 the data suggests that as watersheds get being developed with sewage and waste water input higher riverine dch4 can be expected without consideration of carbon deposition in sediment a total c of 181 8 kt y 1 is yielded in the lcr basin of which 62 113 5 kt c y 1 is emitted into the atmosphere in the forms of co2 99 and ch4 1 and 38 68 3 kt c y 1 is exported further downstream in the forms of dissolved inorganic carbon 90 and doc 10 fig 7 here previously reported data including the lcr s water surface area 84 69 km2 li and zeng 2018 dissolved inorganic carbon 39 9 mg l 1 ni et al 2020 and discharge 48 5 m3 s 1 in the xiaohuangguayuan and duoke hydrological stations of the lcr fig 1b xu and zang 2011 was used for estimation the proportion of c gases in total c flux is higher than that found in the zambezi river 39 6 teodoru et al 2015 but comparable to that found in the tropical low order streams of australia 60 atkins et al 2017 suggesting that vertical carbon emission has dominant control on the lcr carbon balance it is worth noting that diffusive emission of ch4 1 0 kt ch4 c y 1 corresponds to 23 of the total co2 diffusive emission as 33 0 kt c co2 eq y 1 assuming that the global warming potential of 1 kg ch4 is equivalent to 34 kg co2 over a 100 year period dean et al 2018 this suggests that important contribution of ch4 to the local carbon budget should be taken seriously accordingly the lcr totally emits 145 5 kt co2 c equivalent to the atmosphere per year the sequestration of c by terrestrial vegetation in the yuanmou county fig 1b was about 4 88 103 kt c y 1 2017 chen et al 2020a meaning that 3 0 of sequestered c was offset by the diffusive emission from water air interface this reveals the importance of c evasion of low order rivers in local carbon budget 5 conclusion we highlight the scale effects of land use land cover lulc types on dissolved carbon dioxide partial pressure of co2 pco2 and dissolved methane dch4 in low order streams the stream pco2 and dch4 is better explained by lulc types at smaller scale reach scale in the lcr basin further urban land at reach scale showed higher explanation power of pco2 and dch4 than cropland grassland and forest land in the wet season the increased percentage of urban land in the lcr basin and the decreasing pco2 with increasing stream order result in the higher average calculated pco2 than the value from the main stem ten years ago the lower pco2 and dch4 was observed in the wet season than the dry season increasing flow velocity and stream order decrease the concentration of pco2 and dch4 in the river the outgassing flux 113 5 kt c y 1 in the lcr is about 1 7 fold of the total lateral export of dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic carbon 68 3 kt c y 1 showing the potential to offset a part of the sequestrated carbon by local terrestrial ecosystem the scale effects of lulc on riverine c gases provide new insights into the reduction of pollution and carbon emissions for sustainable development goal because that reasonable land use planning is not only beneficial to water quality management but also to alleviating river carbon emission declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the

15100,we analyzed the impacts of land use land cover types on carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 concentration and diffusion in 1st to 4th strahler order tributaries of the longchuan river to the upper yangtze river in china by using headspace equilibration method and co2sys program field sampling and measurements were conducted during the dry and wet seasons from 2017 to 2019 the average of calculated co2 partial pressure pco2 mean sd 2389 3220 μatm by co2sys program was 1 9 fold higher than the value mean sd 1230 1440 μatm 10 years ago in the longchuan river basin where the urban land area increased by a factor of 7 times further analysis showed that corrected pco2 by headspace method and dissolved ch4 dch4 decrease as the stream order and flow velocity increase the pco2 and dch4 in the wet season was lower than that in the dry season the explanatory ability of land use types on the variation of corrected pco2 and dch4 was stronger at the reach scale than at the riparian and catchment scales in two seasons urban land at reach scale further showed much higher explanation on corrected pco2 and dch4 than cropland grassland and forest land in the wet season the longchuan river emits approximately 112 5 kt co2 c and 1 0 kt ch4 c per year being 1 7 fold of the total lateral export of dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic carbon 68 3 kt c y 1 the findings highlight

transporting terrigenous carbon c to the marine system but function as a complex processor that transform store and release large amounts of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 gases into the atmosphere cole et al 2007 stanley et al 2016 the global estimates of riverine co2 emission vary largely from 0 2 pg c y 1 to 2 2 pg c y 1 cole et al 2007 lauerwald et al 2015 li et al 2021a raymond et al 2013 sawakuchi et al 2020 and there is an even much wider range of riverine ch4 outgassing estimates from 2 tg ch4 y 1 to 30 3 tg ch4 y 1 bastviken et al 2011 li et al 2021a stanley et al 2016 the increasing field data of riverine co2 and ch4 emissions caused the revised estimated numbers li et al 2021a sawakuchi et al 2020 low order streams comprising the greatest stream length in a river basin downing et al 2012 have been found to have higher partial pressure of co2 pco2 and dissolved ch4 concentrations dch4 borges et al 2019 brigham et al 2019 teodoru et al 2015 being a disproportional contributor to riverine c emission li et al 2021a marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 under emphasis of carbon cycles of low order stream ecosystems can cause large uncertainties in global carbon budget marx et al 2017 hence more field observations of co2 and ch4 emission particularly from low order streams can help a better evaluation of local and global c budgets from river systems low order streams are experiencing rapid changes in nutrient enrichment and carbon dynamics gu et al 2022 tang et al 2021b as world s population continues to increase and urban development continues progressing with the development of global urbanization the increasingly intensified human activities have caused land use changes with encroachment of urbanized terrain on cropland cropland exploitation and reclamation of forest han et al 2017 which drastically influence structures and functions of river ecosystem allan 2004 meyer et al 2005 in rivers strongly affected by human activities carbon dynamics in the river water can be regulated in several ways li et al 2022a zhang et al 2023 changes in land use land cover lulc can accelerate chemical weathering and erosion causing more carbonate and bicarbonate ions entering adjacent streams chetelat et al 2008 hartmann et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 which are a major source of carbon contributing to the total dissolved carbon telmer and veizer 1999 zeng and masiello 2010 point source and non point source pollutants induced by urban development and agricultural practices can increase nutrient and carbon loadings to the adjacent riverine systems affecting aquatic biogeochemical processing blann et al 2009 li et al 2009 tang et al 2019 also increased nutrient loadings exert complex effects on the balance between co2 production and consumption as well as other greenhouse gases jia et al 2019 li et al 2020b organic carbon level could enhance microbial degradation modifying in stream production of co2 and ch4 ballester et al 1999 howarth et al 1992 wang et al 2021 the oxidation of dch4 due to methane oxidizing bacteria through aerobic and anaerobic processes would lead to an increase in pco2 but a decrease in dch4 borges et al 2019 deutzmann et al 2014 in addition sewage discharge and effluents from wastewater treatment plants may contain a large amount of dissolved co2 and ch4 alshboul et al 2016 smith et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 low order streams dominate a riverine landscape and support the ecological functions of downstream systems vannote et al 1980 due to relatively smaller size and higher edge to water volume ratios low order streams are more susceptible to the impacts of terrestrial inputs induced by land use changes de mello et al 2018 ding et al 2016 gu et al 2022 multi scale investigation has been made to analyze the influence of lulc over river condition the spatial scales of lulc are measured at reach riparian and catchment scales and their clear differences are articulated as follows 1 reach is often defined as a buffer of several hundred meters in width and length above a sampling site 2 riparian is usually described as a specific area along the each side surrounding a river channel but extending to the entire upstream above a site 3 catchment is the entire catchment upstream of a site allan 2004 shi et al 2017 previous studies have emphasized that co2 and ch4 are largely driven by the terrestrial contribution within a certain residence length crawford et al 2014 leng et al 2021 for example crawford et al 2014 found that stream co2 decreases to almost complete depletion within 1400 m downstream without addition and the ch4 residence length is relatively shorter the scale largely depends on the gas transfer properties and flow velocity e g 3u k where u is the flow velocity and k is the gas exchange coefficient demars et al 2015 meanwhile the variation of the scale effects is definitely related to the topography precipitation and connectivity between riparian wetland and stream channel borges et al 2019 lambert et al 2016 leng et al 2021 for example the larger submerged riparian area caused the higher ch4 in the stream characterized by smoother hills compared to stream characterized by steeper hills during the rainy season leng et al 2021 several recent studies have reported the relationship between lulc and riverine c gases i e co2 and ch4 borges et al 2018 tang et al 2021b wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 but few studies have investigated the scale effects of lulc on fluvial c gases seasonality gu et al 2022 understanding their interactions in low order streams is essential for addressing the challenge of accurate estimation of stream c emission regional c balance and mitigation to global climate change to improve our understanding we conducted five field campaigns in measuring riverine pco2 and dch4 at 34 locations distributed in the 1st to 4th order steams of the longchuan river basin a headwater area of the upper yangtze river this area has been under rapid urbanization development in the last two decades two previous studies reported pco2 levels in the river computed with the co2sys software li et al 2012 ni et al 2020 and these modeling estimates have not never been validated furthermore the studies did not analyze dch4 variation as well as the responses of pco2 and dch4 to the lulc conditions in the drainage area in this study we aimed to 1 investigate the spatial temporal variability of pco2 dch4 and their diffusive fluxes as well as compare pco2 level with that of ten years before 2 examine the influence of scale effects of lulc on fluvial pco2 and dch4 and 3 identify the controls of variability and coupling relationships among pco2 dch4 and ambient factors the gases have an ordinary property of rapid gas exchange demars et al 2015 and the streams are generally well aerated stanley et al 2016 so that the effect of upstream and surrounding lulc is thought to be limited to small scales therefore we intended to test the hypothesis that the lulc had scale effects with stronger influence on riverine c gases at smaller reach scale than larger riparian or catchment scale in low order streams the findings gained from this study provide insights into the effects of lulc and hydrological factors on dissolved c gases 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in the longchuan river basin lcr 24 49 26 14 n 100 58 102 4 e strahler order 5 in southwest china the river is a headwater tributary of the yangtze river located in chuxiong yi autonomous prefecture of yunnan province fig 1 the drainage basin is about 9256 km2 in a longitudinal range gorge region with a main channel length of 246 km this area has high average cumulative sunshine hours of 2549 h and is characterized by a sub tropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 14 8 21 9 fig s1 the annual average precipitation is 800 1000 mm with 86 94 of the total precipitation occurring during may october wet season fig s1 except for the lower basin area yuanmou county which has a dry hot climate characterized by lower rainfall 610 mm and serious soil erosion zhou et al 2004 the discharge of the lcr is controlled by catchment precipitation leading to more than 80 of total stream flow occurring in the wet season xu and zang 2011 topography of the river basin is characterized by mountains and hills with the highest elevation of 3000 m and the lowest 700 m the parent rocks are triassic shales and sandstone with small proportion of granite limestone and quaternary deposits with abundant carbonates in the drainage basin he et al 2010 the area is dominated by purple soil classified as regosols in the food and agriculture organization fao taxonomy which is very susceptible to water erosion and weathering li et al 2012 since the chinese central government promotes a west development strategy that intends to modernize the region the urbanization rate and urban population have increased from 20 3 and 0 52 million to 46 5 and 0 87 million in the chuxiong yi autonomous prefecture in the last two decades respectively https www hongheiku com meanwhile the lulc types have changed for example the percentage of urban has a seven fold increase from 0 3 in 2009 to 2 3 in 2017 while cropland increases in downstream and decreases in upstream with no changed percentage in the lcr basin fig 2 and table s1 river water quality was affected by point source and non point source pollutants cheng et al 2020 li et al 2021b accordingly local government has carried out a number of ecological and environmental protection projects such as designation of natural protection areas construction of new wastewater treatment plants and improvement of sewage pipe networks 2 2 sampling and analyses five field measurement and sampling were performed at 34 locations in the 1st 4th streams of the lcr basin during the dry season 21 25

annual repetition experiment and seasonal differences among them 21 sampling sites were in the tributaries and 13 sampling sites were in the mainstem fig 1 during sampling period the wet season accounts for 79 to 98 of the annual rainfall 312 904 mm in the mouding county which is the center area in the longchuan river catchment fig s1 the amount of monthly precipitation in the sampling month was 15 8 mm may 2017 23 1 mm september 2017 and 84 8 mm september 2019 in the wet season while 4 7 mm january 2017 and 5 3 mm april 2019 in the dry season in stream measurements on ph water

co2sys program with ph water temperature and ta regarding the two field samplings during 2019 surface water pco2 and dch4 were also measured by the headspace equilibration method herreid et al 2021 ortega et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 briefly 40 ml of water samples were collected in a 60 ml gas tight syringe from a depth of about 10 cm below the surface and equilibrated with 20 ml volume of atmospheric air after vigorous shaking to promote equilibration headspace gas was injected into a pre evacuated glass nichiden rika glass co ltd japan atmospheric co2 and ch4 concentrations were concurrently collected for analysis duplicate or three replicates were analyzed throughout the study the headspace air was analyzed by gas chromatograph gc clarus 580 perkinelmer usa with 10 ppmv ch4 and 349 6 ppmv co2 for concentration verification check up the original water pco2 μatm and dch4 nmol l 1 were then calculated according to the temperature and headspace ratio using henry s law

suggested that overestimation of calculated pco2 with respect to measured pco2 are link to the contribution of organic acids to the total alkalinity in view the difference of average concentration of doc between two seasons table 2 the observed calculated pco2 from the dry season and wet season was fit separately and the formula with the highest coefficient of determination r2 was chosen for further analysis a model between calculated pco2 and measured pco2 was developed with logarithmic transformation of the data dry season measured pco2 23 5e1 2288 log calculated p co 2 r2 0 73 n 31 p 0

data are scrutinized with an exclusion of two maxima and was consequently used for the latter analysis these two maxima in the dry season were perhaps the results of occasional leakage of domestic sewage and low streamflow velocity 0 or 0 01 m s 1 in two sampling sites when compared with the reported riverine pco2 data from co2sys program calculated pco2 in this study was adopted to avoid potential methodological bias 2 3 water air co2 and ch4 diffusive fluxes co2 and ch4 diffusive flux f mmol m 2 d 1 was estimated by the thin boundary layer tbl model as follows 6 f k c water c atm 7 k

order in our studied streams k600 models from small rivers in the amazon and mekong basin see eq 9 alin et al 2011 and usa see eq 10 raymond et al 2012 were used for obtaining reliable and reasonable k600 values in view of the similar ecological stress from soil erosion and the range of weed speed in the lcr basin wind speed ranged from 0 to 2 4 m s 1 and yellow river basin wind speed ranged from 0 9 to 2 8 m s 1 eqs 11 13 from yellow river basin ran et al 2017a ran et al 2015 were also used for the estimation of k600 to help generate the likely magnitude of co2 and ch4 areal estimates since eq 12 and eq 13 were respectively from the spring dry season and summer wet season ran et al 2017a they were also used for the estimation of k600 in the dry and wet seasons respectively in river system gas transfer velocity has classically been modeled based on physical characteristics such as streamflow velocity stream depth discharge and slope alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 these k600 models provide the possibility of estimating fluxes across broad regions where no direct measurements are available borges et al 2019 looman et al 2021 but different k600 models could yield different estimates of fluxes wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 multiple models that are recommended for rivers with the characteristics as the lcr e g channels 100 m wide low stream order and similar ecological issues can help generate the likely magnitude of co2 and ch4 areal estimates for all sampling streams in two seasons 2 4 spatial data the strahler stream order was extracted from the hydroriver dataset https www hydrosheds org lulc types were analyzed using the remote sensing data with 10 m resolution in 2017 gong et al 2019 fig 2b and 30 m resolution in 2009 yang and huang 2021 fig 2a the digital elevation model dem data for the study area was obtained from china s geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca and lulc types in 2017 was used to evaluate the importance of the spatial extent on the lulc effects on dissolved c gases concentration the presentations of seven spatial scales of lulc in 2017 are shown in fig 2c and fig s3 different scales of lulc were extracted at the reach riparian scales of 500 1000 1500 m and the catchment scale ding et al 2016 shi et al 2017 for reach scale of 500 m 500 m upstream the sampling site was considered to be the geographical center and a circle with radius of 500 m was created similar method was used to obtain the reach scale of 1000 1500 m for riparian scale a band width of 500 1000 1500 m on each side extending to the entire upstream above sampling sites was analyzed the catchment scale included the entire catchment upstream the monitoring site 2 5 data quality and uncertainty the average

c 2 0 and 1 respectively the relative error of replicated measuring of nutrients was below 5 doc concentrations were determined in triplicate with coefficient of variance 2 ph values were generally neutral or basic with a range of 7 09 9 15 fig s4a excluding two acidic ph values measured in the streams draining paddy fields or rubbish dump the high ta 2640 1896 µeq l 1 measured in all river samples indicated that water was carbonate buffered due to the abundant carbonate rocks in streams fig s4b doc tdn and tdp averaged 4 77 1 70 mg l 1 2 06 3 21 mg l 1 and 0 62 1 35 mg l 1 could result in a small proportion of organic acids anions and non carbonated alkalinity which could contribute to the overestimation of the calculated pco2 abril et al 2015 hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 regarding measured pco2 koschorreck et al 2021 indicated that increasing water headspace ratio e g 2 1 was adopted in this study and using air as headspace can significantly reduce the magnitude of error in headspace method therefore the headspace used could limit the uncertainty photosynthesis imparts a daily cycle on riverine pco2 clow et al 2021 li et al 2020b unfortunately we could not determine the diurnal variations and correct co2 measures affected by sampling time however we sampled running waters and avoided the time 12 00 am to 14 00 pm with intensive light and high temperature field measurements during the day may cause underestimate of riverine pco2 and co2 fluxes which were 1 2 1 8 times lower than the values at night in some rivers zhang et al 2020b for ch4 the diffusion reported here was considered conservative in view of other pathways such as ebullition via bubbles mcginnis et al 2016 wang et al 2021 and plant mediated emission via vascular plants stanley et al 2016 were not included 2 6 statistical analyses all data were checked for normality and homogeneity using the shapiro wilk and levene s test and the results showed that most of them were not normally distributed the mann whitney test was used to assess whether the spatial and seasonal variables were significantly different ibm spss statistics 24 the redundancy analysis rda was used to examine the explanation of lulc in multiple spatial scales on pco2 and dch4 using canoco 5 software a spearman rank correlation analysis was employed to detect relationships between pco2 dch4 lulc types on different scales and physicochemical parameters originpro 2021 the explanatory ability of ambient environmental variables on pco2 and dch4 were explored using stepwise multiple linear regression mlr by ibm spss statistics 24 a significance level of p at 0 05 was used the full dataset is available in the table s4 and table s5 in the supplementary document 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations of pco2 and dch4 and their diffusive fluxes pco2 varied from 159 μatm to 6591 μatm with an average of 1266 990 μatm in the lcr fig 3 a and table 1 the average of pco2 was 1 2 times higher in the dry season than in the wet season 1401 1214 μatm vs 1182 816 μatm p 0 05 table 1 fluvial dch4 spanned more than two orders of magnitude from 12 nmol l 1 to 5801 nmol l 1 with an average of 749 1115 nmol l 1 fig 3b and table 1 similar to pco2 the average of dch4 was significantly i e 2 2 times higher in the dry season than in the wet season 1092 1410 nmol l 1 vs 456 677 nmol l 1 p 0 01 table 1 the means of pco2 and dch4 decreased with increased stream order with the highest value 2357 1732 μatm 2010 2942 nmol l 1 occurring in the 1st order streams and the lowest value 842 676 μatm 411 692 nmol l 1 in the 4th order streams figs 3c and 3d pco2 was observed to show significant differences among 1st order 2nd order and 4th order streams fig 3c the average of k600 calculated from the five models ranged 7 3 cm h 1 to 640 7 cm h 1 with an average of 45 5 sd 57 1 cm h 1 comparable to the means 45 5 cm h 1 or 42 5 cm h 1 calculated from eq 9 in the daning river ni et al 2019 and measured by chambers in small tributaries mean sd 48 4 53 2 cm h 1 li et al 2019 in the upper yangtze river the k600 value was between the two values 8 cm h 1 and 59 8 cm h 1 reported by previous studies in the lcr however k600 for this study was clearly higher than the value used for global rivers 20 8 cm h 1 calculated from eq 10 raymond et al 2013 and the measured value in small rivers of usa 19 6 cm h 1 raymond et al 2012 therefore direct k600 measurements are recommended to further refine the k600 for flux estimation the k600 calculated from five models showed that the average of all k600 in dry season was lower than that in the wet season 41 1 54 3 cm h 1 vs 48 2 58 8 cm h 1 p 0 05 table 1 on the contrary estimated co2 flux fco2 and ch4 flux fch4 in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the wet season fco2 335 4 518 9 mmol m 2 d 1 vs 283 7 433 7 mmol m 2 d 1 fch4 3 6 3 9 mmol m 2 d 1 vs 1 7 2 5 mmol m 2 d 1 p 0 01 table 1 in the lcr catchment estimated fco2 ranged from 234 0 mmol m 2 d 1 to 6065 8 mmol m 2 d 1 with an average of 303 4 468 3 mmol m 2 d 1 table 1 4 i e 6 samples of 161 sampling river segments showed the sink of atmospheric co2 and 4 samples were in the dry season the average of fch4 was estimated at 2 6 3 4 mmol m 2 d 1 ranging from 0 03 mmol m 2 d 1 to 19 2 mmol m 2 d 1 in the basin table 1 all sampling river segments were the source of atmospheric ch4 3 2 relationship of pco2 and dch4 with land use patterns on different scales the rda results showed the spatial scale effects of lulc on pco2 and dch4 fig 4 the higher total variation in pco2 and dch4 could be explained by land use types at the reach scales moreover the explanatory ability of land use types decreased when the scales were enlarged to riparian and catchment the urban land at reach scale 500 m can respectively explain 5 3 and 12 1 simple effect of variation of pco2 and dch4 during the dry season and wet season but the explanation of urban land decreased to 2 4 and 3 6 in catchment scale respectively the explanatory ability of lulc on stream c gases was relatively higher in the wet season than that in the dry season accordingly pco2 was positively correlated with the percentages of urban land and cropland on the reach scale of 1000 1500 m and dch4 was positively correlated with the percentage of urban land on the reach scale of 500 m during the dry season p 0 05 fig 5 a in the wet season pco2 was positively correlated with the proportion of urban land at reach scales of 500 1000 1500 m and riparian scales of 500 1000 m p 0 05 fig 5a 3 3 relationship of pco2 and dch4 with physicochemical factors seasonal variations of physicochemical parameters are presented in table 2 there were significant differences in twater do doc tdn tdp nh4 n and tss between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 with higher averages of twater do doc tdn nh4 n and tss in the wet season the spearman s correlations among pco2 dch4 and physicochemical factors are shown in fig 5b pco2 and dch4 were negatively correlated with streamflow velocity and ph in the two seasons and negatively correlated with do and positively correlated with doc and tdp in the wet season p 0 05 significant positive relationship between pco2 and dch4 was observed in the wet season r 0 68 p 0 01 but not in the dry season fig 5b multiple regressions showed that the variation of pco2 could be explained by grassland at catchment scale and ec in the dry season r2 0 42 p 0 01 but doc and twater in the wet season r2 0 23 p 0 05 fig 6 a for dch4 tdp ph and grassland at reach scale of 1000 1500 m were the powerful predictors for dch4 in the wet season r2 0 70 p 0 01 fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 the roles of riverine hydrologic factors the riverine concentrations of c gases are a multiple consequence of degassing endogenous metabolism and external inputting driven by hydrologic factors liu and greaver 2009 stanley et al 2016 stream order or size is generally considered to be an important hydrologic control on riverine pco2 and dch4 pco2 and dch4 were found to be highest in 1st order streams and to decrease with increasing steam order in line with recent previous studies borges et al 2019 li et al 2021a wallin et al 2018 the directly co2 and ch4 input via groundwater benthic carbon degradation and leaching from riparian soil respiration could be assumed to be the important sources that resulted in high pco2 and dch4 in headwater streams hotchkiss et al 2015 jones and mulholland 1998 marx et al 2017 for example marescaux et al 2018 found that pco2 in the groundwater can reached up 65000 µtm and be 5 10 times higher than the surface water on the contrary the increasing discharge and decreasing ratio of edge to water volume could reduce the percentage of co2 and ch4 input from groundwater and soil respiration in higher order rivers li et al 2021a this implies that pco2 and dch4 in low order streams are higher than that in high order main stem streamflow velocity mediated by climate and the channel geomorphologic features is a critical driver on riverine pco2 and dch4 by affecting the degassing rate of dissolved gas raymond et al 2012 and biogeochemical processing i e balance between c gases production and consumption mitrovic et al 2011 ward et al 2018 for example the riverine co2 almost completely outgassed and approached atmospheric equilibrium as the river plunges down over victoria falls teodoru et al 2015 in addition increasing streamflow velocity can lead to reduced hydraulic retention time and thus rapid hydrological cycling which is unfavorable to the co2 consumption by photosynthesis cotovicz et al 2015 xia et al 2019 the mentioned process i e hydraulic control on pco2 was evidenced by findings of the negative relationship between streamflow velocity and pco2 fig 5b the negative relationship between dch4 and streamflow velocity fig 5b is in line with the findings in rivers in the skogaryd research catchment sweden natchimuthu et al 2017 and northern quebec canada campeau and del giorgio 2014 this is linked to degassing rate of dissolved gas and highly sensibility of methanogenic and methane oxidation to do enhanced by turbulence liu and whitman 2008 stanley et al 2016 as reflected by their negative relationship fig 5b therefore the higher streamflow velocity table 2 could be a potential driver of the lower concentrations of c gases in the wet season than that in the dry season in the lcr 4 2 effects of land use land cover types urban and cropland are considered as intense human activities that directly or indirectly affect pco2 and dch4 in the rivers first cropland and urban land can lead to the enrichment of nutrients in adjacent rivers during the expansion and development process thereby accelerating the production of co2 and ch4 and carbon loss of river ecosystem raymond et al 2008 rosemond et al 2015 wang et al 2021 in addition chemical weathering enhanced by agricultural activities e g fertilization transition reclamation can enhance export of carbonate alkalinity from soils to rivers subsequently fueling the riverine pco2 li et al 2020a raymond and cole 2003 second rivers draining urban and cultivated area are influenced by untreated domestic sewage effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp and leaching from soil which are not only bring nutrients and organic matter to rivers but also contain high levels of co2 and ch4 jin et al 2018 jones and mulholland 1998 marwick et al 2014 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 on the contrary grassland or forest area could reduce pollutants and carbon input from terrestrial sources borken et al 2003 de souza et al 2013 leading to lower pco2 and dch4 as well as pollutant concentration in rivers bodmer et al 2016 borges et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the surface runoff caused by rainfall and overflow of sewage pipes can make urban land an important contributor to pollution loadings in rivers during the wet season chen et al 2016 paul and meyer 2001 smith et al 2017 this is verified by the fact that the higher explanatory ability of urban land on variation of physicochemical parameters than cropland in the wet season table s2 the more contribution of urban land to the riverine c gases was also observed in the wet season which is reflective to the different correlation of pco2 with lulc between the two seasons fig 5a the extent of influence from cropland on river is associated with the tillage management and geographic characteristics gu et al 2019 for example paddy land had a much stronger effect on water quality and riverine ch4 than dry cropland wu et al 2019 field survey showed the dominant dry cropland around the sampling sites 4 3 scale effects of land use land cover the overall variation of pco2 and dch4 was explained better by reach scales than by riparian or catchment scale land use types as indicated by the positive relationship between urban land or cropland at reach scales and pco2 or dch4 this scale effects are similar to the land use influence on water quality ding et al 2016 pratt and chang 2012 for example urban land displayed a stronger positive correlation with degraded water quality at small scales shi et al 2017 and water quality e g water temperature chl a ec nh4 n in the mountainous catchments was best explained by land use at reach scale ding et al 2016 this is likely because the effect of conversion of natural vegetation into urban land and cropland is greater along the river in mountainous area fig 2b as reflected by the acutely decreasing percentage of urban and cropland from reach scale to watershed scale fig s3b furthermore the solubility degassing and oxidation characteristics of gases in water may also affect the scale effect of lulc for example the solubility of ch4 in water is very low and ch4 is easy to be oxidized and outgassed in a short distance i e 10 1000 m as water moves downstream stanley et al 2016 this may explain that ch4 is positively related with urban land only on reach scale of 500 m in the dry season fig 6b as regards co2 the balance between production and consumption is changeable longitudinally thereby affecting co2 concentration at larger scales the hydrological connectivity between terrestrial lands and stream channel would be better in the wet season so the effect of lulc would become more prominent for the riverine c gases in wet seasons bracken and croke 2007 leng et al 2021 we found the terrestrial effect is expectedly larger in the wet season than that in the dry season this is supported by the higher explanatory ability of lulc on the c gases in the wet season the scale of the highest explanatory ability of lulc on stream c gases enlarges from reach scale of 1000 m during the dry season to 1500 m during the wet season fig 4 precipitation can activate flow paths that is absent in the dry season and also accelerate streamflow velocity cohen et al 2016 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 previous studies reported that the connectivity of river with flooded forest wetland and floodplain areas during the wet season could drive higher riverine pco2 and dch4 because of external inputs of enormous c gases and organic carbon abril et al 2014 borges et al 2019 on the contrary we observed the higher averages of pco2 and dch4 in the dry season in the lcr in our sampling area there are not lateral wetlands or other water bodies e g lakes the contribution from hydrological connectivity may be confined from riparian sterile soil in the lcr catchment with steep terrain leng et al 2021 in addition concentrated rainfall can have a dilution effect particularly in the catchment with steep terrain showing rapid hydrological cycling therefore during the wet season the combination of the diluting effect of concentrated precipitation fig s1 and the influence of accelerated c gases degassing induced by higher gas transfer velocity table 2 overcome the promotional effect of lateral inputs resulting in the lower riverine pco2 and dch4 4 4 the roles of riverine physicochemical factors increasing nutrient elements and organic carbon inputs would elevate the respiration rate accompanied by the depletion of o2 and increase of pco2 for example the respiration rate in the river downstream receiving sewage and waste water is three times higher than the average found in the upstream with less pollution in the piracicaba river ballester et al 1999 dissolved ch4 concentration generally represents the result of methanogenesis since the decomposition of organic matter mainly under anoxic conditions liu and whitman 2008 therefore dissolved oxygen and organic carbon are vital drivers of riverine pco2 and dch4 as it is also reflected in the negative relation of pco2 and dch4 with stream do and the positive relation with doc found in the wet season fig 5b implying the potential biological control on pco2 and dch4 on the other hand intense carbonate weathering process in the lcr catchment of the longitudinal ridge valley area he et al 2010 could be an important source of pco2 in the dry season similar to the seasonal variation of pco2 in the tigris river turkey with karst carbonate rocks in the basin due to diluting effect of higher discharge by concentrated precipitation reflected in the lower ec table 2 and the more contribution from urban land to pollution loading in the wet season the proportion of pco2 from chemical weathering may decrease while the proportion of pco2 that was associated with biological metabolism may increase this is consistent with previous observation that the percentage of 12c enriched dic co2 from soil respiration and organic matter oxidation increased during the wet season in the mun river li et al 2022b therefore pco2 showed significant correlation with do doc tdp and nh4 n in the wet season but these close linkages were not observed in the dry season fig 5b this was also well reflected in that the variation of pco2 was positively explained by ec in the dry season while by doc and twater in the wet season fig 6a ch4 can be readily oxidized to co2 in the oxygen rich rivers shelley et al 2015 stanley et al 2016 which may have contributed to the significant positive relationship between dch4 and pco2 in the wet season with higher do level fig 5b table 2 such relations have been observed in other studies for instance in the meuse river belgium borges et al 2018 some urban rivers in baltimore united states smith et al 2017 borges et al 2018b speculated that the two gases may have had the same source such as the overflow of sewage pipes and leaching from soil resulted from precipitation li et al 2012 smith et al 2017 similar to pco2 the variation of dch4 could be positively explained by tdp in the wet season fig 6 however our finding that no significant relationship between dch4 and pco2 exist in the dry season fig 5b may suggest that dch4 and pco2 likely have different sources 4 5 importance of pco2 and dch4 and diffusive fluxes the average 2389 3220 μatm of calculated pco2 is 1 9 times more than the previous average value 1230 1440 μatm calculated using co2sys in the lcr during 2008 2009 where only one sampling site xiaohekou hydrological station in upstream of mainstem was included li et al 2012 this difference is partly due to the increased percentage of urban land fig 2 and table s1 and partly to the higher pco2 in headwater tributaries than the main stem included in this study fig 3c compared with daning river 1198 μatm calculated by co2sys program another tributary of the upper yangtze river the average calculated pco2 in the lcr is almost 2 times higher ni et al 2019 this may be related to the decreased pco2 by enhanced photosynthesis resulting from the development of cascade reservoirs in the daning river however the calculated pco2 and the pco2 1334 1389 μatm corrected by headspace equilibration method in the lcr is lower than the average value of several larger rivers i e the yangtze river 2662 1240 μatm calculated by co2sys program ran et al 2017b and amazon river system 3929 μatm calculated with ph and alkalinity lauerwald et al 2015 which can be attributed to different pollution loads chen et al 2020b and hydrologic connectivity with wetland abril et al 2014 respectively for example water quality e g biochemical oxygen demand nh4 n and tp of the upper reaches of the yangtze river was better than that in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river chen et al 2020b the measured dch4 749 1115 nmol l 1 in the low order streams of the lcr is comparable to previous measurements in suburban rural rivers or reaches such as tributaries of hudson river 633 93 nmol l 1 usa brigham et al 2019 and tributaries in the upper reaches of yangtze river 764 708 nmol l 1 china tang et al 2021b but the average of dch4 is lower than values found in seriously polluted rivers draining highly urbanized landscapes for example xiaoyue river in beijing 5400 nmol l 1 china wang et al 2020 and urban tributary of han river south korea 2327 nmol l 1 jin et al 2018 the data suggests that as watersheds get being developed with sewage and waste water input higher riverine dch4 can be expected without consideration of carbon deposition in sediment a total c of 181 8 kt y 1 is yielded in the lcr basin of which 62 113 5 kt c y 1 is emitted into the atmosphere in the forms of co2 99 and ch4 1 and 38 68 3 kt c y 1 is exported further downstream in the forms of dissolved inorganic carbon 90 and doc 10 fig 7 here previously reported data including the lcr s water surface area 84 69 km2 li and zeng 2018 dissolved inorganic carbon 39 9 mg l 1 ni et al 2020 and discharge 48 5 m3 s 1 in the xiaohuangguayuan and duoke hydrological stations of the lcr fig 1b xu and zang 2011 was used for estimation the proportion of c gases in total c flux is higher than that found in the zambezi river 39 6 teodoru et al 2015 but comparable to that found in the tropical low order streams of australia 60 atkins et al 2017 suggesting that vertical carbon emission has dominant control on the lcr carbon balance it is worth noting that diffusive emission of ch4 1 0 kt ch4 c y 1 corresponds to 23 of the total co2 diffusive emission as 33 0 kt c co2 eq y 1 assuming that the global warming potential of 1 kg ch4 is equivalent to 34 kg co2 over a 100 year period dean et al 2018 this suggests that important contribution of ch4 to the local carbon budget should be taken seriously accordingly the lcr totally emits 145 5 kt co2 c equivalent to the atmosphere per year the sequestration of c by terrestrial vegetation in the yuanmou county fig 1b was about 4 88 103 kt c y 1 2017 chen et al 2020a meaning that 3 0 of sequestered c was offset by the diffusive emission from water air interface this reveals the importance of c evasion of low order rivers in local carbon budget 5 conclusion we highlight the scale effects of land use land cover lulc types on dissolved carbon dioxide partial pressure of co2 pco2 and dissolved methane dch4 in low order streams the stream pco2 and dch4 is better explained by lulc types at smaller scale reach scale in the lcr basin further urban land at reach scale showed higher explanation power of pco2 and dch4 than cropland grassland and forest land in the wet season the increased percentage of urban land in the lcr basin and the decreasing pco2 with increasing stream order result in the higher average calculated pco2 than the value from the main stem ten years ago the lower pco2 and dch4 was observed in the wet season than the dry season increasing flow velocity and stream order decrease the concentration of pco2 and dch4 in the river the outgassing flux 113 5 kt c y 1 in the lcr is about 1 7 fold of the total lateral export of dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic carbon 68 3 kt c y 1 showing the potential to offset a part of the sequestrated carbon by local terrestrial ecosystem the scale effects of lulc on riverine c gases provide new insights into the reduction of pollution and carbon emissions for sustainable development goal because that reasonable land use planning is not only beneficial to water quality management but also to alleviating river carbon emission declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the

2020a although various iron based catalysts with fine structures have been constructed to activate h2o2 their limitations such as low effective oxidant utilization low oh utilization and narrow ph applicability are far from satisfactory gao et al 2021 yin et al 2021 the design of new catalytic systems with sufficient activity to overcome the limitations of low effective utilisation of h2o2 and oh is highly attractive and is important for the efficient treatment of trace amounts of refractory organic pollutants in complex aqueous environments such as those containing natural organic matter nom although the mechanism of the fenton reaction is not fully understood the main reactive oxygen species ros involved in the multiphase reaction are still thought to be generated via the fe ii fe iii cycle eqs 1 4 koppenol 2001 amongst them the production of oh is usually limited by the fe ii fe iii cycle worse still slow reduction of fe iii leads to a low efficiency of h2o2 decomposition to

centres cao et al 2020 and directed built in electric field mediated electron transfer zuo et al 2022 may provide valuable clues for accelerating the fe iii fe ii cycle for efficient conversion of

an extremely effective strategy for the efficient removal of refractory micropollutants and efficient utilisation of ros in complex aqueous environments however the adsorption of contaminants could occupy the active sites hindering the heterogeneous fenton reaction chen et al 2021b whereas a single strategy falls far short of the desired effect the coupled assembly of multifunctional reactors for multi step synergy remains largely an under explored area interactions such as π π conjugation of metal organic frameworks mofs with their own organic ligand structures and aromatic organic compounds can adsorb aromatic organic compounds on the surface and thus improve the efficient utilisation of ros fan et al 2020 li et al 2021a feocl a layered mineral with octahedral feo4cl2 layers was developed as a fenton like catalyst which could activate h2o2 to generate oh sun et al 2018a 2018b yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2021b however its effective catalysts may transform to the other less effective solids e g iron oxides in some practical applications chen et al 2021a recently mofs composites with core shell structures have emerged as an attractive new class multifunctional materials however the rational assembly of feocl and mofs with well defined structures has not been reported dai et al 2022 inspired by these the encapsulation of feocl within mofs endowing the catalyst with high adsorption capacity for aromatic organics and effective ros generation could significantly shorten the migration distance of ros to pollutants spatial confinement at the nanoscale can significantly accelerate contaminant degradation which may be attributed to the increased local proton concentration and specific surface area exposure zhang et al 2021a more importantly mofs as surface porous shells provide a possible pathway for the interception of macromolecular impurities and the crossing of small molecules of non degradable organic pollutants which is important for the selective removal of pollutants in complex aqueous environments zhang et al 2020c in this work the first in situ growth of mofs materials of institut lavoisier 101 mil 101 fe on the feocl surface was used to provide an feocl mof yolk shell reactor for fenton like catalysis the interaction between feocl and mof was firstly analysed by morphology and structure for improving the electronic structure with suitable d band centres facilitating the release of ros the catalytic degradation performance and mechanism of feocl mof was investigated to illustrate the advantages of concentrating catalysis and adsorption in a confinement space for rapid oh generation release and utilisation the systematic evaluation of bisphenol a bpa removal as well as the exploration of experimental characterisation and theoretical calculations demonstrate the great promise of mof constrained feocl as a fenton like catalyst for efficient pollution remediation 2 experiments 2 1 synthesis feocl was prepared by partial pyrolysis feocl and h2bdc were added to dmf and reacted by microwave heating to 120 c the resulting mixture was washed with ethanol to obtain feocl mof the heating times of 5 min 10 min 20 min and 30 min were labelled feocl mof 1 feocl mof 2 feocl mof 3 and feocl mof 4 respectively if not specified feocl mof was feocl mof 2 replace feocl with fecl3 6h2o to make mof 2 2 experiment the catalyst and oxidant were added sequentially to the pollutant containing solution to obtain a solution of 0 5 g l catalyst 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 05 mm bpa the ph is controlled by naoh and h2so4 use 10 mm borate buffer to control ph in certain experiments the solution was mixed with magnetic stirring so that it fully reacted and the liquid was removed and filtered through a 0 45 µm filter membrane and detected by high performance liquid chromatography each experiment was repeated three times 2 3 methods the analytical and characterization methods can be found in texts s1 s2 s3 and s4 the calculation method can be found in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and properties the feocl mof was prepared as shown in fig 1 a a series of feocl mofs were successfully prepared by following this procedure xrd revealed an atypical feocl pattern similar to the exfoliated flake feocl in previous reports fig 1b wang et al 2022 with increasing preparation time feocl mof showed diffraction peaks similar to femof mil 101 duan et al 2018 xu et al 2020 this indicates the successful in situ growth of femof on the feocl sem shows a typical lamellar structure of feocl fig 1c the mof is in a broken spindle shape which can be speculated that femof has mil 101 fe as its main structure fig 1d the irregular structure may be due to microwave synthesis and mof contains a large number of unsaturated coordination structures these unsaturated coordination structures may lead to local electron density changes and exposure of more metal centers favoring electron transfer and reactant binding which may facilitate reaction kökçam demir et al 2020 furthermore the tem images revealed a yolk shell structure composed of mof wrapped sheet like feocl fig 1f and g energy dispersive spectroscopy eds mapping showed a structure with uneven distribution of fe and c elements and c was approximately distributed around cl and fe fig s1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps showed the presence of fe cl o c elements in feocl mof fig s2 these results suggest a possible yolk shell structure of feocl mof feocl mof and feocl mof showed different particle sizes and specific surface areas the particle size table s1 and specific surface area fig s3 increased with the increase of surface mof the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum shows a similar pattern to xrd fig 1h the characteristic peaks at 480 cm 1 and 554 cm 1 are attributed to fe o feocl and fe o femof respectively han et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the characteristic peaks at about 1000 cm 1 to 1600 cm 1 are attributed to organic ligands such as cooh c o and oh of femof respectively sun et al 2022 wan et al 2020 the appearance and gradual increase of the characteristic peaks of mof in feocl mof further confirms the xrd sem and tem results that the in situ growth of mof on feocl produced the feocl mof yolk shell wrapped structure to further explore the process of in situ growth of mof on feocl a two dimensional ftir correlation analysis 2d ftir cos was carried out based on one dimensional ftir spectroscopy chen et al 2020 ding et al 2020 in the simultaneous spectra four main peaks were observed at 480 cm 1 554 cm 1 1390 cm 1 1601 cm 1 and 485 cm 1 corresponding to fe o feocl fe o femof cooh femof and c o femof respectively fig 1i the higher peak intensities at 480 cm 1 554 cm 1 1390 cm 1 and 1601 cm 1 may be due to the fe o bonding of femof and the increase in organic ligands during the original for growth in addition negative cross peaks were observed suggesting that fe o feocl and femof organic ligands change in opposite trends during the process the results also provide direct evidence for the in situ growth of femof using fe on feocl and suggest that the fe o feocl and femof organic ligands change asynchronously according to noda yoshiyo s rules asynchronous spectra can reveal the order of changes in the process fig 1j table s2 the asynchronous mapping is antisymmetric about the diagonal and therefore shows no auto peaks in table s2 many cross peaks x1 480 are shown for the negative signal indicating that the 480 cm 1 peak changes before the other peaks specifically fe o on feocl breaks off while fe with organic ligands grows femof in situ on the feocl surface afterwards the close interaction between feocl and femof may affect the electronic structure of feocl and femof which leads to changes in electrochemical properties and catalytic behaviour the effect of feocl mof interaction on the electronic structure is further analysed by xps the xps vb test showed that the highest occupied orbitals homo energy level of feocl mof and feocl mof were 1 48 ev 1 73 ev and 3 36 ev respectively implying differences in their electronic structures and possible electronic interactions fig 2 a the xps fine spectra analysed the electronic structure changes in detail fe 2p showed distinct peaks at 710 4 and 724 2 ev assigned to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 as well as satellite peaks fig 2b sun et al 2018b since both feocl and mof contain fe the valence states of fe 2p in feocl and mof could not be distinguished the electronic structures of feocl and mof were analysed by cl 2p feocl and c 1s femof representing feocl and mof respectively c 1s shows that the binding energy of feocl mof is shifted to a high degree compared with mof fig 2c cl 2p shows that the binding energy of feocl mof is shifted lower compared to feocl fig 2d jiang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 this may imply that the interaction between feocl and mof leads to the electrons transfer from mof to feocl increasing the electron density of feocl and decreasing the electron density of mof zhao et al 2022 the intrinsic driving force for the change in electronic structure is further explored by density flooding theory dft according to the equation ϕ ev ef ev and ef are the vacuum and fermi energy levels respectively the work functions of mil 101 fe and feocl are estimated to be 3 66 ev and 4 97 ev respectively fig 2e low et al 2019 xu et al 2018 therefore when the two contact the electrons of mof tend to migrate to feocl to balance their fermi energy levels optimisation the established geometrical structure model fig s4 the differential charge density directly shows the interfacial electron transfer from mof to feocl fig 2f and also the directional built in electric field between feocl and mof which is consistent with the xps results the interfacial electron transfer may also affect the electronic structure of feocl and mof thus profoundly affecting the catalytic behaviour electrochemical impedance eis and cyclic voltammetric curves cv were used to investigate the electrochemical properties the eis results showed that feocl mof had a smaller semicircular arc compared to feocl and mof indicating that the interaction of feocl mof leads to higher electrical conductivity thereby improving electron transport efficiency fig 2g wang et al 2019 feocl mof exhibited stronger faradaic current compared to feocl and mof implying faster electron transport capability which is consistent with the eis results fig s5 the symmetry of the cv morphology indicates that the electron transfer during catalysis is reversible wan et al 2020 this may be attributed to the facilitation of electron transfer by the directional built in electric field thus exhibiting higher electrochemical activity 3 2 catalytic performance and ros this electric field modulated catalytic behaviour is of interest as shown in fig 2h the endocrine disruptor bpa was used as a model pollutant and the differences in h2o2 catalysis and bpa removal between feocl mof feocl and mof were significant feocl mof showed superior catalytic performance than feocl and mof figs 2h and s6a the bpa removed by adsorption alone was shown in fig s6b which confirms that the removal of bpa is mainly due to catalytic degradation it is worth noting that the degradation rate of bpa in this system also compares favourably with previous studies using feocl or mof table s3 compared with feocl 0 03263 min 1 and mof 0 01062 min 1 the kinetic reaction rates of feocl mof 0 1125 min 1 increased by 3 4 and 10 6 times respectively indicating a synergistic effect between the two catalytic stability is essential for pollution control in the aqueous environment multi cycle experiments showed that feocl mof could maintain more than 80 of bpa removal fig s7 xrd and xps also showed the stability of its crystal structure and chemical composition fig s8a and s8b the trace changes in rate may be due to the adsorption of organic pollutants bpa to the structure of the catalyst some chemical interactions cause the lattice spacing of the catalyst to change and the pollutants are enriched on the surface coverage li et al 2018 the change in xrd could also be the reason of this processes however these do not affect the performance stability of feocl mof in catalytic degradation these results further demonstrate the critical role of the directional built in electric field of feocl mof in maintaining excellent stability a clear ros role is fundamental to explore superior catalytic performance fenton like reaction is usually mediated by oh not surprisingly tert butanol tba showed significant inhibition of bpa degradation figs 2i and s9a buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 xiao et al 2022 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr was used to further detect the active species with no oh measured in h2o2 while oh signal was clearly detected in feocl mof h2o2 in addition bpa could affect the signal intensity of oh fig s9b this further suggests that feocl mof h2o2 mediated oh is the main ros for the degradation of bpa inhibitors of 1o2 nan3 as inhibitor and o2 p benzoquinone bq as inhibitor showed only limited inhibition fig s10a although the production of small amounts of methylphenyl sulfone pmso2 demonstrated the presence of fe iv species in the system fig s10b methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso had no inhibitory effect on bpa removal fig s10a this indicates that 1o2 o2 and fe iv are not the main active species leading to the degradation of bpa high oxidant utilisation has been a key indicator of excellent fenton like reactions molecular probes benzoic acid ba were used to quantify oh production chen et al 2017 the oh was detected in feocl mof h2o2 in a continuous efficient manner while instantaneous large amounts of oh were detected in fe2 h2o2 0 3192 g l equal to fe content in feocl mof the fe content in the catalyst measured by icp is 63 84 fig s11a h2o2 consumption showed similar results fig s11b the effective utilisation of h2o2 was accounted for at 77 1 feocl mof and 25 5 fe2 respectively fig 3 a which implies that feocl mof achieves an extremely high oxidant utilisation in contrast the presence of organic contaminants may promote the decomposition of h2o2 which may be attributed to the π π conjugation of organic contaminants with mofs electrostatic hydrogen bonding and other interactions that may induce an electron giving effect of organic matter thus promoting the catalysis of h2o2 fig s12 the results of epr confirmed this from the side the oh signal was stronger in the feocl mof h2o2 bpa system than that in the feocl mof h2o2 bpa system with same reaction time fig 3b lyu et al 2018 feocl mof exhibited an effective oxidant utilisation 3 02 times higher than that of the homogeneous fenton reagent this may be partly due to the directional built in electric field within feoc mof promoting electron transfer which effectively improves the redox cycle in the metal centre avoiding the low effective utilisation due to the reduction of high valent metals by h2o2 and achieving efficient selective reduction of h2o2 on the other hand it may be due to the utilized nearby with the organic matter adsorbed at the surface mof achieving the in situ targeted utilisation of oh 3 3 interfacial behaviour and catalytic mechanism in depth analysis of the catalytic process and interfacial reactions was essential to explore the mechanisms underlying the excellent catalytic performance and pollutant removal efficiency of feocl mof xps fine spectra compared the reacted fe 2p h2o2 and bpa all interacted with feocl mof fig 3c specifically h2o2 increased the average valence of fe and bpa decreased the average valence of fe further the cl 2p and c 1s results confirm this conclusion with an increase in electron density upon interaction with bpa and a decrease in electron density upon interaction with h2o2 figs 3d and e s13 and s14 the interaction of bpa with feocl mof was analysed by electrochemical tests linear scanning voltammetry lsv showed that the presence of bpa decreased the oxidation potential of feocl mof and chronoamperometry test i t observed that the addition of bpa resulted in a change in current density this implies that the presence of bpa results in a much lower electron transfer potential on the catalyst surface figs s15 and s16 notably the electrochemical impedance of feocl mof was significantly reduced with the addition of small amounts of h2o2 and bpa fig 3f the presence of bpa significantly increased the electron transfer rate of the reaction system these results demonstrate that bpa is not only adsorbed on the surface by mof but can act as an electron donor to provide electrons for the reaction thus increasing the yield of oh further the tafel equation was used to investigate the kinetics of surface bpa anodic oxidation of feocl mof fig s17 when the applied potential is higher than the bpa oxidation potential the bpa will generate a current and the overpotential leads to an exponential increase in current shinagawa et al 2015 because the nature of anodic oxidation is a direct electron transfer process of reactants at the anodic interface the kinetic constants of the reactants visually reflect the number of electrons anodic oxidation was further verified by tafel curves where the electron transfer process at potentials greater than 0 5 v is the key process for electrooxidation the tafel slope of feocl mof is much lower than that of feocl and mof indicating that feocl mof has a faster electron transfer capability for bpa oxidation fig 3g ren et al 2019 this directly confirms the improvement of the electronic structure by the built in electric field of feocl mof which makes it easier to obtain electrons from organic pollutants this is consistent with the previous findings that feocl mof oxidises bpa to gain electrons and that the directional built in electric field mediates electron transfer to promote efficient catalytic reduction of h2o2 in addition two dimensional correlation analysis by ftir showed that the organic ligand of mof participated in the reaction before fe o feocl which directly confirms that the interaction between mof and bpa is crucial in the catalytic process figs 3h and i and s18 table s4 these properties arise from the fact that feocl and mof interactions improve its electronic structure the electronic structure was further investigated by theoretical calculations of the density of electron rubbing states dos d band centres of feocl and mil 101 fe were calculated to be 0 625 ev and 27 072 ev respectively fig 4 a and the dos on the surface near the fermi energy level originated mainly from fe 3d states they are closely related to the electronic interactions of the adsorbate with and on the feocl mof surface the electronic interactions can be seen as a coupling between the adsorbate and the transition metal d state leading to bonding and antibonding orbitals fig 4b bonding orbitals are usually fully populated because they are below the fermi energy level whereas the electron filling of antibonding orbitals depends on the state relative to the fermi energy level the d band centres ed are good descriptors of adsorbent metal interactions and are used here to describe h2o2 and reactive oxygen intermediates oh soon et al 2007 sun et al 2020 this implies that mof is very unfavourable for o adsorption compared to feocl so it can be speculated that h2o2 adsorbs and reacts on feocl rather than mof the d band centre of feocl is too close to the fermi energy level which may lead to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates oh that are not easily desorbed and quenched in situ or lead to poisoning of the active site of feocl in feocl mof on the other hand the d band centre is calculated to be 2 570 ev and its orbitals near the fermi energy level are more discrete fig 4a on the one hand this allows feocl mof to still maintain a better adsorption and response to h2o2 and also reduces the adsorption of the reaction intermediate ros compared to feocl making it easier to release zuo et al 2021 on the other hand the d orbital distribution near the fermi energy level in feocl mof is more discrete which means that its electron mobility is better and favours the catalytic reduction of h2o2 on the other hand when h2o2 is placed on mof and feocl mof respectively h2o2 can only be adsorbed and reacted by feocl mof fig 4c and d although mof cannot react effectively with h2o2 the o o bond in h2o2 near mof is elongated to 2 485 å compared to the initial 1 453 å of h2o2 mof can influence the o o bond in h2o2 thus making it more susceptible to cleavage and thus co operating with feocl to catalyse the reduction of h2o2 combining experimental and theoretical settlements a possible interfacial catalytic mechanism is postulated fig 4e eqs 5 11 the interaction between feocl and mof leads to an inhomogeneous charge distribution resulting in a directional built in electric field this leads to an elevated electron density of feocl that favours the catalytic reduction of h2o2 and a reduced electron density of mof that captures electrons from bpa and facilitates the redox process by mediating electron transport by the directional built in electric field more importantly the improved electronic structures of feocl and mof with suitable d band centres are not only favourable for the adsorption of h2o2 but also for the desorption of oh the rapidly released oh can be utilized nearby by the bpa adsorbed by the in situ grown mof thus greatly improving the effective utilisation of h2o2 in addition the mof can elongate the o o in h2o2 making it easier to be cleaved thus synergising with the feocl catalysed reduction of h2o2 5 b p a m o f m o f e b p a a d 6 m o f e f e o c l m o f f e o c l e 7 f e o c l e h 2 o 2 f e o c l o h o h

environment contains a variety of complex factors that influence this there was no difference in the kinetics of bpa removal by feocl mof at ph 3 9 figs 5 a and s19 this implies that feocl mof can maintain excellent catalytic degradation over a wide ph range in contrast ph online monitoring revealed that the ph of the aqueous environment changed to approximately 3 4 with the addition of the catalyst in a ph 3 9 environment without buffer salts fig 5b the zeta potential results show that the surface charges of feocl mof are negative in a ph range of 3 11 fig s20 this may be due to the surface properties of the catalyst it has been reported that the overlap of the double electric layer through the surface of the charged pore at the nano confined space 5 nm increases the potential within the nanopore zhang et al 2021a as a result the concentration of counterions protons increases for electrically negative surfaces that are in the nanoconfinement this means that the h concentration near the surface of the mof pore will be much higher than the average concentration this concentration of surface protons creates a surface acidic microenvironment that helps to significantly enhance the kinetics in complex ph environments and may also increase the binding between the surface and oppositely charged substances fig 5c this is further confirmed by comparison of homogeneous phase experiments in a buffered salt environment fig s21 this implies that reactions in this restricted space can be made independent of macroscopic ph limitations and remain active bao et al 2022 yan et al 2021 continuous operation in the reactor is essential to test the practical applicability of the fenton like catalyst a pilot plant was designed in which a large number of 1 cm 1 cm 0 2 cm cotton felts were immersed in a solution of 1 g l feocl mof dispersion as shown in fig 5d the reactor consisted of a catalytic tower loaded with cotton felt loaded by the catalyst and a simulated wastewater vessel a mixture of pollutants and h2o2 was continuously fed into the reaction hydraulic residence time 60 min long term operation results showed a stable pollutants phenolic antibiotics and dyes removal rate of over 90 fig 5d this confirms the potential of feocl mof for practical applications the reaction parameters were further investigated to optimise the process increases in catalyst concentration h2o2 concentration and temperature all provide kinetic reaction rates however the increasement of bpa resulted in the opposite trend figs s22 s25 kinetic models were developed based on statistical fitting of the arrhenius equation to the kinetic parameters catalyst concentration oxidant concentration pollutant concentration ph temperature eqs 12 and 13 the predicted and experimental values showed a good correlation fig 5e in a real water environment yangtze water natural organic matter soluble microorganisms and complex substances in the water may have side effects three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed a weakening of the characteristic peaks of nom and bpa after the reaction indicating that feocl mof also performs well for the degradation of organic matter in real water environments fig 5f and g these results can provide guidance for feocl mof treatment processes used for real pollution control 12 k p r e d i c t 0 77477 k

in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy the peaks at 1673 cm 1 1482 m 1 and 1194 cm 1 can be attributed to c o cooh c o etc respectively fig 5h this means that the bpa on the catalyst surface was oxidated to degradation products which in turn continued to react to eventually convert to co2 and h2o the total organic carbon toc results also indicated that bpa was oxidatively degraded fig s26 the degradation products were analysed by uplc ms fig s27 and table s5 the electronic states of the different atoms of bpa and degradation products differ due to the influence of adjacent groups and elements the highest occupied orbital homo energy level and the lowest unoccupied orbital lumo of bpa and degradation products were analysed according to frontier molecular orbital theory fmo chi et al 2020 li et al 2020a moghadam et al 2019 the possible degradation pathways were assumed fig 5i and the acute toxicity of bpa and its degradation products was predicted by the toxicity evaluation software tool test jiang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 acute toxicity was assessed by the lc50 96 h for fathead minnow concentration of chemical causing 50 death at 48 h in fathead minnow and the lc50 48 h for daphnia magna concentration of chemical causing 50 death at 48 h in daphnia magna as shown in fig 5j and k the degradation of bpa produced some less toxic and harmless products the results of the toxicity evaluation show that most of the degradation products of bpa are low toxicity and harmless with a gradual decrease in toxicity as the oxidation process proceeds these intermediates have a minimal impact on the environment the above results demonstrated that the toxic effects of these resultant organic pollutants were significantly reduced after feocl mof h2o2 treatment 4 conclusions this work encapsulates feocl in mof for the first time and demonstrates its efficiency in fenton like in situ growth of mil 101 fe on the surface of feocl forms a yolk shell structure composite that confines the high electron density catalytic sites to the interior of the mof the interaction between feocl and mof not only increases the electron density of feocl but also shifts down the d band centre the improved electronic structure of feocl rapidly catalyzes h2o2 to produce and desorb large amounts of oh that can be utilized nearby by the bpa adsorbed by mof thus achieving a very high effective oxidant utilization 77 1 3 02 times higher than that of homogeneous fenton reactions the rapid adsorption of target pollutants by mof could increase the effective utilization of oh and the confining effect of its nanopore channels could also enhance the plasmonic effect of the surface stean electric layer build an acidic microenvironment and exhibit significant

15101,fenton like reactions is attractive for environmental pollutant control but there is an urgent need to improve the utilisation of hydroxyl radicals oh in practical applications here for the first time feocl is encapsulated within a metal organic framework mof materials of institut lavoisier 101 mil 101 fe as a yolk shell reactor feocl mof by in situ growth the interaction between feocl and the mof not only increases the electron density of feocl but also shifts down the d band centre the increase of electron density could promote the efficient conversion of h2o2 to oh catalysed by feocl and the shift of the d band centre to the lower energy level facilitates the desorption of oh experimental and theoretical calculations showed that the high catalytic performance was attributed to the unique yolk shell structure that concentrates the catalytic and adsorption sites in a confinement space as well as the improved electron density and d band centre for efficient generation rapid desorption and utilized nearby of oh which is utilized nearby by the organic pollutants adsorbed by the surface mof thus greatly improving the effective conversion of h2o2 and the oh utilisation from 25 5 fe2 h2o2 to 77 1 feocl mof h2o2 in addition a catalytic reactor was constructed to achieve continuous efficient treatment of organic pollutants this work provides a fenton like microreactor for

an extremely effective strategy for the efficient removal of refractory micropollutants and efficient utilisation of ros in complex aqueous environments however the adsorption of contaminants could occupy the active sites hindering the heterogeneous fenton reaction chen et al 2021b whereas a single strategy falls far short of the desired effect the coupled assembly of multifunctional reactors for multi step synergy remains largely an under explored area interactions such as π π conjugation of metal organic frameworks mofs with their own organic ligand structures and aromatic organic compounds can adsorb aromatic organic compounds on the surface and thus improve the efficient utilisation of ros fan et al 2020 li et al 2021a feocl a layered mineral with octahedral feo4cl2 layers was developed as a fenton like catalyst which could activate h2o2 to generate oh sun et al 2018a 2018b yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2021b however its effective catalysts may transform to the other less effective solids e g iron oxides in some practical applications chen et al 2021a recently mofs composites with core shell structures have emerged as an attractive new class multifunctional materials however the rational assembly of feocl and mofs with well defined structures has not been reported dai et al 2022 inspired by these the encapsulation of feocl within mofs endowing the catalyst with high adsorption capacity for aromatic organics and effective ros generation could significantly shorten the migration distance of ros to pollutants spatial confinement at the nanoscale can significantly accelerate contaminant degradation which may be attributed to the increased local proton concentration and specific surface area exposure zhang et al 2021a more importantly mofs as surface porous shells provide a possible pathway for the interception of macromolecular impurities and the crossing of small molecules of non degradable organic pollutants which is important for the selective removal of pollutants in complex aqueous environments zhang et al 2020c in this work the first in situ growth of mofs materials of institut lavoisier 101 mil 101 fe on the feocl surface was used to provide an feocl mof yolk shell reactor for fenton like catalysis the interaction between feocl and mof was firstly analysed by morphology and structure for improving the electronic structure with suitable d band centres facilitating the release of ros the catalytic degradation performance and mechanism of feocl mof was investigated to illustrate the advantages of concentrating catalysis and adsorption in a confinement space for rapid oh generation release and utilisation the systematic evaluation of bisphenol a bpa removal as well as the exploration of experimental characterisation and theoretical calculations demonstrate the great promise of mof constrained feocl as a fenton like catalyst for efficient pollution remediation 2 experiments 2 1 synthesis feocl was prepared by partial pyrolysis feocl and h2bdc were added to dmf and reacted by microwave heating to 120 c the resulting mixture was washed with ethanol to obtain feocl mof the heating times of 5 min 10 min 20 min and 30 min were labelled feocl mof 1 feocl mof 2 feocl mof 3 and feocl mof 4 respectively if not specified feocl mof was feocl mof 2 replace feocl with fecl3 6h2o to make mof 2 2 experiment the catalyst and oxidant were added sequentially to the pollutant containing solution to obtain a solution of 0 5 g l catalyst 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 05 mm bpa the ph is controlled by naoh and h2so4 use 10 mm borate buffer to control ph in certain experiments the solution was mixed with magnetic stirring so that it fully reacted and the liquid was removed and filtered through a 0 45 µm filter membrane and detected by high performance liquid chromatography each experiment was repeated three times 2 3 methods the analytical and characterization methods can be found in texts s1 s2 s3 and s4 the calculation method can be found in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and properties the feocl mof was prepared as shown in fig 1 a a series of feocl mofs were successfully prepared by following this procedure xrd revealed an atypical feocl pattern similar to the exfoliated flake feocl in previous reports fig 1b wang et al 2022 with increasing preparation time feocl mof showed diffraction peaks similar to femof mil 101 duan et al 2018 xu et al 2020 this indicates the successful in situ growth of femof on the feocl sem shows a typical lamellar structure of feocl fig 1c the mof is in a broken spindle shape which can be speculated that femof has mil 101 fe as its main structure fig 1d the irregular structure may be due to microwave synthesis and mof contains a large number of unsaturated coordination structures these unsaturated coordination structures may lead to local electron density changes and exposure of more metal centers favoring electron transfer and reactant binding which may facilitate reaction kökçam demir et al 2020 furthermore the tem images revealed a yolk shell structure composed of mof wrapped sheet like feocl fig 1f and g energy dispersive spectroscopy eds mapping showed a structure with uneven distribution of fe and c elements and c was approximately distributed around cl and fe fig s1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps showed the presence of fe cl o c elements in feocl mof fig s2 these results suggest a possible yolk shell structure of feocl mof feocl mof and feocl mof showed different particle sizes and specific surface areas the particle size table s1 and specific surface area fig s3 increased with the increase of surface mof the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum shows a similar pattern to xrd fig 1h the characteristic peaks at 480 cm 1 and 554 cm 1 are attributed to fe o feocl and fe o femof respectively han et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the characteristic peaks at about 1000 cm 1 to 1600 cm 1 are attributed to organic ligands such as cooh c o and oh of femof respectively sun et al 2022 wan et al 2020 the appearance and gradual increase of the characteristic peaks of mof in feocl mof further confirms the xrd sem and tem results that the in situ growth of mof on feocl produced the feocl mof yolk shell wrapped structure to further explore the process of in situ growth of mof on feocl a two dimensional ftir correlation analysis 2d ftir cos was carried out based on one dimensional ftir spectroscopy chen et al 2020 ding et al 2020 in the simultaneous spectra four main peaks were observed at 480 cm 1 554 cm 1 1390 cm 1 1601 cm 1 and 485 cm 1 corresponding to fe o feocl fe o femof cooh femof and c o femof respectively fig 1i the higher peak intensities at 480 cm 1 554 cm 1 1390 cm 1 and 1601 cm 1 may be due to the fe o bonding of femof and the increase in organic ligands during the original for growth in addition negative cross peaks were observed suggesting that fe o feocl and femof organic ligands change in opposite trends during the process the results also provide direct evidence for the in situ growth of femof using fe on feocl and suggest that the fe o feocl and femof organic ligands change asynchronously according to noda yoshiyo s rules asynchronous spectra can reveal the order of changes in the process fig 1j table s2 the asynchronous mapping is antisymmetric about the diagonal and therefore shows no auto peaks in table s2 many cross peaks x1 480 are shown for the negative signal indicating that the 480 cm 1 peak changes before the other peaks specifically fe o on feocl breaks off while fe with organic ligands grows femof in situ on the feocl surface afterwards the close interaction between feocl and femof may affect the electronic structure of feocl and femof which leads to changes in electrochemical properties and catalytic behaviour the effect of feocl mof interaction on the electronic structure is further analysed by xps the xps vb test showed that the highest occupied orbitals homo energy level of feocl mof and feocl mof were 1 48 ev 1 73 ev and 3 36 ev respectively implying differences in their electronic structures and possible electronic interactions fig 2 a the xps fine spectra analysed the electronic structure changes in detail fe 2p showed distinct peaks at 710 4 and 724 2 ev assigned to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 as well as satellite peaks fig 2b sun et al 2018b since both feocl and mof contain fe the valence states of fe 2p in feocl and mof could not be distinguished the electronic structures of feocl and mof were analysed by cl 2p feocl and c 1s femof representing feocl and mof respectively c 1s shows that the binding energy of feocl mof is shifted to a high degree compared with mof fig 2c cl 2p shows that the binding energy of feocl mof is shifted lower compared to feocl fig 2d jiang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 this may imply that the interaction between feocl and mof leads to the electrons transfer from mof to feocl increasing the electron density of feocl and decreasing the electron density of mof zhao et al 2022 the intrinsic driving force for the change in electronic structure is further explored by density flooding theory dft according to the equation ϕ ev ef ev and ef are the vacuum and fermi energy levels respectively the work functions of mil 101 fe and feocl are estimated to be 3 66 ev and 4 97 ev respectively fig 2e low et al 2019 xu et al 2018 therefore when the two contact the electrons of mof tend to migrate to feocl to balance their fermi energy levels optimisation the established geometrical structure model fig s4 the differential charge density directly shows the interfacial electron transfer from mof to feocl fig 2f and also the directional built in electric field between feocl and mof which is consistent with the xps results the interfacial electron transfer may also affect the electronic structure of feocl and mof thus profoundly affecting the catalytic behaviour electrochemical impedance eis and cyclic voltammetric curves cv were used to investigate the electrochemical properties the eis results showed that feocl mof had a smaller semicircular arc compared to feocl and mof indicating that the interaction of feocl mof leads to higher electrical conductivity thereby improving electron transport efficiency fig 2g wang et al 2019 feocl mof exhibited stronger faradaic current compared to feocl and mof implying faster electron transport capability which is consistent with the eis results fig s5 the symmetry of the cv morphology indicates that the electron transfer during catalysis is reversible wan et al 2020 this may be attributed to the facilitation of electron transfer by the directional built in electric field thus exhibiting higher electrochemical activity 3 2 catalytic performance and ros this electric field modulated catalytic behaviour is of interest as shown in fig 2h the endocrine disruptor bpa was used as a model pollutant and the differences in h2o2 catalysis and bpa removal between feocl mof feocl and mof were significant feocl mof showed superior catalytic performance than feocl and mof figs 2h and s6a the bpa removed by adsorption alone was shown in fig s6b which confirms that the removal of bpa is mainly due to catalytic degradation it is worth noting that the degradation rate of bpa in this system also compares favourably with previous studies using feocl or mof table s3 compared with feocl 0 03263 min 1 and mof 0 01062 min 1 the kinetic reaction rates of feocl mof 0 1125 min 1 increased by 3 4 and 10 6 times respectively indicating a synergistic effect between the two catalytic stability is essential for pollution control in the aqueous environment multi cycle experiments showed that feocl mof could maintain more than 80 of bpa removal fig s7 xrd and xps also showed the stability of its crystal structure and chemical composition fig s8a and s8b the trace changes in rate may be due to the adsorption of organic pollutants bpa to the structure of the catalyst some chemical interactions cause the lattice spacing of the catalyst to change and the pollutants are enriched on the surface coverage li et al 2018 the change in xrd could also be the reason of this processes however these do not affect the performance stability of feocl mof in catalytic degradation these results further demonstrate the critical role of the directional built in electric field of feocl mof in maintaining excellent stability a clear ros role is fundamental to explore superior catalytic performance fenton like reaction is usually mediated by oh not surprisingly tert butanol tba showed significant inhibition of bpa degradation figs 2i and s9a buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 xiao et al 2022 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr was used to further detect the active species with no oh measured in h2o2 while oh signal was clearly detected in feocl mof h2o2 in addition bpa could affect the signal intensity of oh fig s9b this further suggests that feocl mof h2o2 mediated oh is the main ros for the degradation of bpa inhibitors of 1o2 nan3 as inhibitor and o2 p benzoquinone bq as inhibitor showed only limited inhibition fig s10a although the production of small amounts of methylphenyl sulfone pmso2 demonstrated the presence of fe iv species in the system fig s10b methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso had no inhibitory effect on bpa removal fig s10a this indicates that 1o2 o2 and fe iv are not the main active species leading to the degradation of bpa high oxidant utilisation has been a key indicator of excellent fenton like reactions molecular probes benzoic acid ba were used to quantify oh production chen et al 2017 the oh was detected in feocl mof h2o2 in a continuous efficient manner while instantaneous large amounts of oh were detected in fe2 h2o2 0 3192 g l equal to fe content in feocl mof the fe content in the catalyst measured by icp is 63 84 fig s11a h2o2 consumption showed similar results fig s11b the effective utilisation of h2o2 was accounted for at 77 1 feocl mof and 25 5 fe2 respectively fig 3 a which implies that feocl mof achieves an extremely high oxidant utilisation in contrast the presence of organic contaminants may promote the decomposition of h2o2 which may be attributed to the π π conjugation of organic contaminants with mofs electrostatic hydrogen bonding and other interactions that may induce an electron giving effect of organic matter thus promoting the catalysis of h2o2 fig s12 the results of epr confirmed this from the side the oh signal was stronger in the feocl mof h2o2 bpa system than that in the feocl mof h2o2 bpa system with same reaction time fig 3b lyu et al 2018 feocl mof exhibited an effective oxidant utilisation 3 02 times higher than that of the homogeneous fenton reagent this may be partly due to the directional built in electric field within feoc mof promoting electron transfer which effectively improves the redox cycle in the metal centre avoiding the low effective utilisation due to the reduction of high valent metals by h2o2 and achieving efficient selective reduction of h2o2 on the other hand it may be due to the utilized nearby with the organic matter adsorbed at the surface mof achieving the in situ targeted utilisation of oh 3 3 interfacial behaviour and catalytic mechanism in depth analysis of the catalytic process and interfacial reactions was essential to explore the mechanisms underlying the excellent catalytic performance and pollutant removal efficiency of feocl mof xps fine spectra compared the reacted fe 2p h2o2 and bpa all interacted with feocl mof fig 3c specifically h2o2 increased the average valence of fe and bpa decreased the average valence of fe further the cl 2p and c 1s results confirm this conclusion with an increase in electron density upon interaction with bpa and a decrease in electron density upon interaction with h2o2 figs 3d and e s13 and s14 the interaction of bpa with feocl mof was analysed by electrochemical tests linear scanning voltammetry lsv showed that the presence of bpa decreased the oxidation potential of feocl mof and chronoamperometry test i t observed that the addition of bpa resulted in a change in current density this implies that the presence of bpa results in a much lower electron transfer potential on the catalyst surface figs s15 and s16 notably the electrochemical impedance of feocl mof was significantly reduced with the addition of small amounts of h2o2 and bpa fig 3f the presence of bpa significantly increased the electron transfer rate of the reaction system these results demonstrate that bpa is not only adsorbed on the surface by mof but can act as an electron donor to provide electrons for the reaction thus increasing the yield of oh further the tafel equation was used to investigate the kinetics of surface bpa anodic oxidation of feocl mof fig s17 when the applied potential is higher than the bpa oxidation potential the bpa will generate a current and the overpotential leads to an exponential increase in current shinagawa et al 2015 because the nature of anodic oxidation is a direct electron transfer process of reactants at the anodic interface the kinetic constants of the reactants visually reflect the number of electrons anodic oxidation was further verified by tafel curves where the electron transfer process at potentials greater than 0 5 v is the key process for electrooxidation the tafel slope of feocl mof is much lower than that of feocl and mof indicating that feocl mof has a faster electron transfer capability for bpa oxidation fig 3g ren et al 2019 this directly confirms the improvement of the electronic structure by the built in electric field of feocl mof which makes it easier to obtain electrons from organic pollutants this is consistent with the previous findings that feocl mof oxidises bpa to gain electrons and that the directional built in electric field mediates electron transfer to promote efficient catalytic reduction of h2o2 in addition two dimensional correlation analysis by ftir showed that the organic ligand of mof participated in the reaction before fe o feocl which directly confirms that the interaction between mof and bpa is crucial in the catalytic process figs 3h and i and s18 table s4 these properties arise from the fact that feocl and mof interactions improve its electronic structure the electronic structure was further investigated by theoretical calculations of the density of electron rubbing states dos d band centres of feocl and mil 101 fe were calculated to be 0 625 ev and 27 072 ev respectively fig 4 a and the dos on the surface near the fermi energy level originated mainly from fe 3d states they are closely related to the electronic interactions of the adsorbate with and on the feocl mof surface the electronic interactions can be seen as a coupling between the adsorbate and the transition metal d state leading to bonding and antibonding orbitals fig 4b bonding orbitals are usually fully populated because they are below the fermi energy level whereas the electron filling of antibonding orbitals depends on the state relative to the fermi energy level the d band centres ed are good descriptors of adsorbent metal interactions and are used here to describe h2o2 and reactive oxygen intermediates oh soon et al 2007 sun et al 2020 this implies that mof is very unfavourable for o adsorption compared to feocl so it can be speculated that h2o2 adsorbs and reacts on feocl rather than mof the d band centre of feocl is too close to the fermi energy level which may lead to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates oh that are not easily desorbed and quenched in situ or lead to poisoning of the active site of feocl in feocl mof on the other hand the d band centre is calculated to be 2 570 ev and its orbitals near the fermi energy level are more discrete fig 4a on the one hand this allows feocl mof to still maintain a better adsorption and response to h2o2 and also reduces the adsorption of the reaction intermediate ros compared to feocl making it easier to release zuo et al 2021 on the other hand the d orbital distribution near the fermi energy level in feocl mof is more discrete which means that its electron mobility is better and favours the catalytic reduction of h2o2 on the other hand when h2o2 is placed on mof and feocl mof respectively h2o2 can only be adsorbed and reacted by feocl mof fig 4c and d although mof cannot react effectively with h2o2 the o o bond in h2o2 near mof is elongated to 2 485 å compared to the initial 1 453 å of h2o2 mof can influence the o o bond in h2o2 thus making it more susceptible to cleavage and thus co operating with feocl to catalyse the reduction of h2o2 combining experimental and theoretical settlements a possible interfacial catalytic mechanism is postulated fig 4e eqs 5 11 the interaction between feocl and mof leads to an inhomogeneous charge distribution resulting in a directional built in electric field this leads to an elevated electron density of feocl that favours the catalytic reduction of h2o2 and a reduced electron density of mof that captures electrons from bpa and facilitates the redox process by mediating electron transport by the directional built in electric field more importantly the improved electronic structures of feocl and mof with suitable d band centres are not only favourable for the adsorption of h2o2 but also for the desorption of oh the rapidly released oh can be utilized nearby by the bpa adsorbed by the in situ grown mof thus greatly improving the effective utilisation of h2o2 in addition the mof can elongate the o o in h2o2 making it easier to be cleaved thus synergising with the feocl catalysed reduction of h2o2 5 b p a m o f m o f e b p a a d 6 m o f e f e o c l m o f f e o c l e 7 f e o c l e h 2 o 2 f e o c l o h o h

environment contains a variety of complex factors that influence this there was no difference in the kinetics of bpa removal by feocl mof at ph 3 9 figs 5 a and s19 this implies that feocl mof can maintain excellent catalytic degradation over a wide ph range in contrast ph online monitoring revealed that the ph of the aqueous environment changed to approximately 3 4 with the addition of the catalyst in a ph 3 9 environment without buffer salts fig 5b the zeta potential results show that the surface charges of feocl mof are negative in a ph range of 3 11 fig s20 this may be due to the surface properties of the catalyst it has been reported that the overlap of the double electric layer through the surface of the charged pore at the nano confined space 5 nm increases the potential within the nanopore zhang et al 2021a as a result the concentration of counterions protons increases for electrically negative surfaces that are in the nanoconfinement this means that the h concentration near the surface of the mof pore will be much higher than the average concentration this concentration of surface protons creates a surface acidic microenvironment that helps to significantly enhance the kinetics in complex ph environments and may also increase the binding between the surface and oppositely charged substances fig 5c this is further confirmed by comparison of homogeneous phase experiments in a buffered salt environment fig s21 this implies that reactions in this restricted space can be made independent of macroscopic ph limitations and remain active bao et al 2022 yan et al 2021 continuous operation in the reactor is essential to test the practical applicability of the fenton like catalyst a pilot plant was designed in which a large number of 1 cm 1 cm 0 2 cm cotton felts were immersed in a solution of 1 g l feocl mof dispersion as shown in fig 5d the reactor consisted of a catalytic tower loaded with cotton felt loaded by the catalyst and a simulated wastewater vessel a mixture of pollutants and h2o2 was continuously fed into the reaction hydraulic residence time 60 min long term operation results showed a stable pollutants phenolic antibiotics and dyes removal rate of over 90 fig 5d this confirms the potential of feocl mof for practical applications the reaction parameters were further investigated to optimise the process increases in catalyst concentration h2o2 concentration and temperature all provide kinetic reaction rates however the increasement of bpa resulted in the opposite trend figs s22 s25 kinetic models were developed based on statistical fitting of the arrhenius equation to the kinetic parameters catalyst concentration oxidant concentration pollutant concentration ph temperature eqs 12 and 13 the predicted and experimental values showed a good correlation fig 5e in a real water environment yangtze water natural organic matter soluble microorganisms and complex substances in the water may have side effects three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed a weakening of the characteristic peaks of nom and bpa after the reaction indicating that feocl mof also performs well for the degradation of organic matter in real water environments fig 5f and g these results can provide guidance for feocl mof treatment processes used for real pollution control 12 k p r e d i c t 0 77477 k

in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy the peaks at 1673 cm 1 1482 m 1 and 1194 cm 1 can be attributed to c o cooh c o etc respectively fig 5h this means that the bpa on the catalyst surface was oxidated to degradation products which in turn continued to react to eventually convert to co2 and h2o the total organic carbon toc results also indicated that bpa was oxidatively degraded fig s26 the degradation products were analysed by uplc ms fig s27 and table s5 the electronic states of the different atoms of bpa and degradation products differ due to the influence of adjacent groups and elements the highest occupied orbital homo energy level and the lowest unoccupied orbital lumo of bpa and degradation products were analysed according to frontier molecular orbital theory fmo chi et al 2020 li et al 2020a moghadam et al 2019 the possible degradation pathways were assumed fig 5i and the acute toxicity of bpa and its degradation products was predicted by the toxicity evaluation software tool test jiang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 acute toxicity was assessed by the lc50 96 h for fathead minnow concentration of chemical causing 50 death at 48 h in fathead minnow and the lc50 48 h for daphnia magna concentration of chemical causing 50 death at 48 h in daphnia magna as shown in fig 5j and k the degradation of bpa produced some less toxic and harmless products the results of the toxicity evaluation show that most of the degradation products of bpa are low toxicity and harmless with a gradual decrease in toxicity as the oxidation process proceeds these intermediates have a minimal impact on the environment the above results demonstrated that the toxic effects of these resultant organic pollutants were significantly reduced after feocl mof h2o2 treatment 4 conclusions this work encapsulates feocl in mof for the first time and demonstrates its efficiency in fenton like in situ growth of mil 101 fe on the surface of feocl forms a yolk shell structure composite that confines the high electron density catalytic sites to the interior of the mof the interaction between feocl and mof not only increases the electron density of feocl but also shifts down the d band centre the improved electronic structure of feocl rapidly catalyzes h2o2 to produce and desorb large amounts of oh that can be utilized nearby by the bpa adsorbed by mof thus achieving a very high effective oxidant utilization 77 1 3 02 times higher than that of homogeneous fenton reactions the rapid adsorption of target pollutants by mof could increase the effective utilization of oh and the confining effect of its nanopore channels could also enhance the plasmonic effect of the surface stean electric layer build an acidic microenvironment and exhibit significant catalytic performance over a wide ph range 3 9 a fixed bed catalytic reactor was constructed to simulate a real world application showing high capacity and stability in the remediation of continuously

15102,hospital wastewater treatment system hwts is an important source and environmental reservoir of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes args however how antibiotic resistome of clinical wastewater changed in hwts is poorly understood herein the basic quantitative traits i e diversity and abundance of args in three hwtss were profiled by metagenomics in total 709 arg subtypes belonging to 20 arg types were detected with relative abundance ranging from 1 12 10 5 to 7 33 10 1 copies cell notably most args could not be significantly removed by chlorination treatment in the hwts these args were identified to confer resistance to almost all major classes of antibiotics and include args of last resort antibiotics such as bla ndm mcr and tet x which were abundantly occurred in hwts with 19 5 and 7 variants respectively moreover qualitative analysis based on metagenome assembled genome mag analysis revealed that the putative hosts of the identified args were broadly distributed into at least 8 dominant bacterial phyla of the 107 arg carrying mags recovered 39 encoded multi antibiotic resistance and 16 belonged to antibiotic resistant pathogens further analysis of co occurrence patterns of args with mobile genetic elements suggested their potential mobility these key qualitative traits of args provided further information about their phylogeny and genetic

introduction the continuous emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance amr have become an enormous threat to human health and ecosystem the world health organization who and the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc classify amr pathogens as an imminent threat to human health who 2014 cdc 2019 currently 700 000 people die each year from infections caused by drug resistant microbes which is predicted to rise to 10 million deaths by 2050 resulting in 100 trillion in lost economic output shankar 2016 amr became the only health issue included in the outcome communique of the leaders summit on 2016 g20 summit in light of this gloomy prospect necessary action should be conducted to tackle antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and recognize the connections between human and animal health and the environment in the one health framework hernando amado et al 2019 hospital wastewater is the hinge of the clinical setting and the environment which has gained attention as an important reservoir and dispersal route of antibiotic resistance determinants the profile of the collection of args i e resistome in hospital wastewater is certainly different from that of other types of wastewaters zhang et al 2020 the risk level of hospital wastewater is further amplified by the extensive use of clinic antibiotics like last resort antibiotics to treat fatal infection the recent emergence of last resort antibiotics resistance mechanism including new delhi metallo β lactamase ndm kumarasamy et al 2010 plasmid mediated colistin resistance mcr liu et al 2016 and high level tigecycline resistance tet x variants he et al 2019 has gained global attention in term of the threat to clinical infections caused by multidrug resistant mdr bacteria the rapid rise in phenotypic resistance to cationic antimicrobial cyclic peptides has challenged renewed interest in colistin as the ultimate line of defense for carbapenem resistant bacterial infections and tet x mediated high level resistance to tigecycline sprang up in the livestock and clinical field subsequently prior studies have mainly used qpcr or high throughput dna sequencing analysis to reveal the effect of chlorine disinfection on last resort args in hospital wastewater loudermilk et al 2022 marathe et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 2021 while these studies provide basic quantitative information of individual args there is still a lack of in depth qualitative knowledge on the key traits of resistome e g resistance mobility host traits and clinical relevance of args found in hospital wastewater limiting our capacity to evaluate their risk to human health compared with qpcr or microarray based studies of args metagenomic studies of environmental resistome especially those based on assembly and binning approaches as recently applied in genome centric metatranscriptomic analysis of urban sewage and activated sludge resistome provided new insights into risk assessment of environmentally found args ju et al 2019 2016 vikesland et al 2017 these approaches have their unique advantages in tracking arg hosts detecting potential pathogenic arbs and exploring the potential of resistance transmission based on the coexistence or co occurrence patterns of args and mobile genetic elements mges in a metagenomic microbiota context liu et al 2019b yuan et al 2021 despite a prominent role of hospital wastewater as the hotspot for the spread of clinically important args marathe et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 to our knowledge a systematic investigation on the presence dynamics and key qualitative traits e g host identity and function of args in hospital wastewater treatment system hwts is lacking although such in depth qualitative insights are essential for the assessment of spread and health risks of amr in hospital wastewater as well as the system efficiency in the removal of clinically important args and resistant pathogens here we comprehensively profiled the antibiotic resistome and tracked their bacterial hosts including human pathogens in the wastewater treatment systems of three local hospitals over four seasons based on shot gun metagenomics and systematic bioinformatics that complementarily integrate regular read based and advanced assembly based metagenomic approaches we analyzed both basic quantitative traits i e diversity and abundance and key qualitative traits i e mobility and host function of args to enhance our knowledge closely associated with the risk assessment of hospital wastewater resistome 1 the diversity and dynamics of args and mges 2 the diversity and dynamics of bacterial pathogens and their correlation with args and mges and 3 the genetic mobility and host traits e g taxonomy pathogenicity and multi resistance of args in the hospital wastewater influents and effluents overall this work expands our horizons on a comprehensive view of the fate and dynamics of antibiotic resistome in hwtss and greatly benefits to environmental and health risk assessments of args 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample origin and collection hospital wastewater samples were collected every three months from three public hospitals in hangzhou city zhejiang province eastern china from september 2018 to july 2019 table s1 three hwtss namely shwts yhwts and zhwts the treatment processes of

mags from three hwts metagenomes were dereplicated using drep v1 4 3 olm et al 2017 leading to 273 unique and high quality mags 2 4 taxonomy and quantification of mags taxonomy assignment of recovered mags was determined by gtdb tk v0 3 2 chaumeil et al 2019 classify wf phylogenetic analysis of the mags was accomplished using fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 based on 120 bacterial domain specific marker genes from gtdb phylogenetic trees were visualized in itol v6 letunic and bork 2007 online server the relative abundance of mags in their corresponding samples was calculated based on reads

gene database sarg v2 0 using ncbi s blastp yin et al 2018 and orfs with a global amino acid identity 60 to any reference sequence were considered as args plasmid sequences in all assembled contigs was predicted by plasflow v1 1 krawczyk et al 2018 with parameter threshold 0 95 the plasmid associated genes were annotated by blastp against ncbi nr database using parameter max target seqs 1 if the arg were found located on the predicted plasmid contigs the arg were regarded as plasmid associated arg then mges were identified by hmmsearch v3 3 2 finn et al 2011 against pfam v34 0 finn et al 2016 followed by keywords match to mges e g insertion sequence iss integrase transposase and plasmid ju et al 2019 the args that either located on a plasmid contig or nearby with an mge 10 kb was considered with potential mobility 2 5 2 identification of pathogenic genes and genomes the identification of potentially pathogenic mags was performed as described in reference yuan et al 2021 briefly potentially pathogenic mags were firstly identified based on the earlier published pathogen lists containing 140 human pathogenic genera and 538 human pathogenic species ju et al 2016 woolhouse and gowtage sequeria 2005 and further verified the presence of virulence factors in the genome by blastp against virulence factor database vfdb liu et al 2019a with a global amino acid identity 70 2 6 statistical and network analyses the abundance of arg types were represented using the circos program krzywinski et al 2009 the phylogenetic tree with heatmap of pathogens was acquired from mega7 maximum likelihood tree with 1000 bootstraps and evolview subramanian et al 2019 pearson s correlation was used to analyze the relationship between args mges and pathogens boxplots bubble graph and line regression were performed with r version 3 5 1 with ggplot2 wickham 2009 and vegan packages oksanen et al 2011 the network was visualized with cytoscape 3 3 0 shannon et al 2003 one way analysis of variance anova was used to assess statistical significance of group difference using spss v22 0 ibm usa where p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the difference in the abundance of args between the influent and effluent was determined by the mann whitney u test where adjusted p 0 05 was considered significant 2 7 data availability the raw sequencing data generated from shotgun metagenomes in this study has been deposited with the ncbi sra prjna675192 other data of this study are available from the authors upon request 3 results and discussion 3 1 diversity and dynamics of args in hwtss in this study wastewater influent and effluent samples from hwtss of three hospitals were collected in four seasons i e spring summer autumn and winter to obtain a comprehensive profile of antibiotic resistomes and microbiota the 24 wastewater samples contained a total of 20 arg types i e resistance types and 709 arg subtypes i e resistance genes which accounted respectively for 80 25 of types and 57 1244 of subtypes of args in the sarg v2 0 databases and conferred resistance to almost all common classes of antibiotics highlighting that hospital wastewater is a potential major conduit for the release of args into the environment resistance gene profiles showed that the five abundant arg types accounted for 75 8 of the total args figs 1 a s1 beta lactam 19 2 7 33 10 1 copies cell aminoglycoside 18 5 7 17 10 1 copies cell multidrug 13 9 5 29 10 1 copies cell sulfonamide 13 0 4 95 10 1 copies cell and tetracycline 11 2 4 30 10 1 copies cell the distribution of arg profiles in influent and effluent was type dependent for example some args were more abundant in influents compared to effluents those against bleomycin chloramphenicol fosfomycin fosmidomycin kasugamycin macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls polymyxin puromycin rifamycin tetracenomycin c tetracycline vancomycin and unclassified resistance genes fig s1 among three hwtss only 9 arg types i e bleomycin chloramphenicol fosfomycin tetracycline mls quinolone polymyxin kasugamycin fosmidomycin rifamycin vancomycin and unclassified resistance genes in zhwts could be significantly removed by chlorination treatment p 0 05 fig 1a other arg types were more abundant in effluent they may be associated to mges and dominate the resistome of hwts che et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the heatmap of the top 30 args revealed that sul1 4 14 10 1 copies cell aada 2 61 10 1 copies cell aac 6 i 2 15 10 1 copies cell qace 1 95 10 1 copies cell dominant args in influents and sul1 3 60 10 1 copies cell aada 2 00 10 1 copies cell ermf 1 76 10 1 copies cell tetq 1 73 10 1 copies cell herein among all targeted 1244 args 97 args were found in all samples these are persistent args not removed by chlorination treatment their relative abundance had no significant difference among seasons p 0 5 suggesting that temperature does not significantly affect the variation of persistent args fig s2 with the marked increase in the frequency of mdr bacteria and the limited availability of novel antibiotics the carbapenems colistin and tigecycline have been regard as last resort antibiotics over the past decades our recent study emphasized the distribution and genetic context of last resort args largs bacteria by qpcr and whole genome sequencing in hwtss the result showed that largs might accelerate the occurrence of superbugs zhu et al 2021 largs bla ndm mcr and tet x were abundant in hwts with 19 5 and 7 variants respectively in the last six years an increasing number of mcr variants 10 in total so far have been identified and placed at different positions in the phylogenies the most abundant last resort antibiotic resistance subtypes were mcr 3 and tet x2 based on the metagenomics data for hwtss fig 1c on the whole the highest relative abundance larg was tet x 0 to 8 90 10 2 copies cells in influents and 0 to 6 92 10 3 copies cells in effluents with an average of 7 39 10 3 copies cell in influents and 5 61 10 3 copies cell in effluents for bla ndm and mcr the average relative abundances in influents were 6 38 10 4 and 2 76 10 3 copies cell respectively whereas those in effluents were 1 79 10 4 and 4 06 10 4 copies cell respectively fig 1d the relative abundance of largs in influents were much higher than in effluents fig 1d p 0 05 our previous results based on qpcr analysis showed that most larg variants mcr 1 mcr 2 and tet x1 tet x5 in effluents exhibited significantly lower absolute abundance than those in influents p 0 01 or p 0 05 zhu et al 2021 these findings indicated that chlorine disinfection could effectively reduce the absolute copies l and relative abundance copies cell of most largs however the wastewater ecosystem is still a vital pool of the larg facilitating the coupling bla ndm mcr and tet x on the same plasmid which posed a significant risk to the clinic and human health 3 2 diversity and dynamics of mges in hwts mges represent a key feature for gram negative bacteria to adapt to their environment especially when selective pressures are present hgt via mges is believed to be the underlying mechanism responsible for the spread of args ellabaan et al 2021 hospital wastewaters may present optimal conditions for horizontal gene exchange via mges high cell density nutrient rich environment and constant contact between antibiotics and arb as well as donor and recipient bacteria hocquet et al 2016 in total 396 insertion sequences iss 239 integrons and 522 plasmids were identified in hwts metagenomes the relative abundance of iss was significantly higher than that of plasmids and integrons p 0 05 fig 2 a overall lower relative abundance of mges in effluents than that of influents were detectable in three hwtss specifically the relative abundance of iss integrons and plasmids in influents were 1 74 1 20 and 1 33 fold that of effluents respectively but only for zhwts the removes of mges by chlorination were significant p 0 05 fig 2a interestingly we observed lower relative abundance of mges in influent than in some effluents e g in spring and summer for influent and effluent samples of shwts like in other environments tian et al 2016 total args showed significant positive correlation with total mges iss integrons and plasmids in influents of hwtss with r 0 886 0 859 0 885 and 0 804 respectively p 0 01 fig 2b suggesting that most args from human gut might be highly mobile more interesting total args showed much lower positive correlation with total mges iss integrons and plasmids r 0 577 0 484 0 635 and 0 929 in effluents of hwtss p 0 01 fig 2c respectively the contrasting results between wastewater influent and effluent samples implied that the chlorination treatment selectively killed some arg carrying bacteria in the influent and the debris of genome and plasmids resulted in the decoupling of co occurrence of args and mges 3 3 diversity and dynamics of bacterial pathogens in hwtss considering clinic particularity it is inevitable that hospital wastewater should harbor diverse and abundant pathogens despite significant improvements in wastewater treatment and management water borne diseases caused by pathogens still account for about 4 of the total mortality rate and 5 7 of total disease burden prüss et al 2002 it was difficult to classify clades at the species level with traditional 16s rrna gene sequence analysis but shotgun metagenome sequencing was useful to identify disease associated taxa metagenomic reads based analysis results showed that the study identified diversified pathogenicity associated clades in hwts the composition of the bacterial community at the phylum level showed proteobacteria 44 2 bacteroidetes 35 5 firmicutes 12 5 and actinobacteria 2 9 as the most dominant microbes fig s3 in three hwtss betaproteobacteria 17 9 and bacteroidia 15 9 made up a significant portion of the total population fig s4 a total of 353 pathogenic bacteria compare with the list of bacterial pathogens in a previous study li et al 2015a were detected fig 3 a arcobacter bacteroides aeromonas acinetobacter and enterobacteriaceae were found in both influents and effluents which of removal rate were 52 7 79 2 some important clinic pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa removal rate 88 0 streptococcus suis removal rate 87 2 acinetobacter johnsonii removal rate 80 1 staphylococcus aureus removal rate 77 0 acinetobacter baumannii removal rate 23 6 klebsiella pneumonia removal rate 24 8 vibrio cholera removal rate 13 8 and haemophilus influenza removal rate 22 6 were identified based on their relative abundances table s3 their abundance was lower in the effluent fig 3a suggesting that wastewater chlorination treatment can reduce the relative abundance of some hbps however many important causative organisms like e coli 2 60 10 4 a baumannii 2 38 10 4 a johnsonii 2 01 10 4 k pneumonia 1 03 10 4 or pseudomonas 2 98 10 3 were abundant in the treated effluents fig 3a table s3 this suggests that despite chlorination the risk of waterborne diseases in these effluents remains high pathogenic bacteria are more susceptible to acquire and spread args than nonpathogenic bacteria wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 and strong links between args mges and pathogens were also observed in our study fig 3b for example args encoding beta lactam resistance were strongly associated r 0 8 p 0 01 to multiple mges 6 plasmids and 3 integrons and crucial pathogens e g salmonella enterica r 0 87 p 0 01 the latter is among the most important foodborne pathogens globally who 2018 plasmids and integrons may contribute to the spread of β lactam args in both non pathogens and pathogens multidrug resistant mdr s enterica is prevalent in parts of asia and africa mejia et al 2021 and β lactam resistant s enterica is difficult to treat in the clinic kuang et al 2018 given the high proportion 85 of args strongly associated with mges args from the clinic may be introduced into the environment via hwts and transmitted to pathogens co occurrence patterns of arg types mges and bacterial pathogens were also explored using network analysis fig 3b significant correlations existed among kasugamycin tetracycline and mls with mges and certain pathogens which might be attributed to the coexistence of these resistance genes and mges in many clinical bacterial genomes these results reveal an important role for mges in args dissemination in the environment by increased accessibility to bacterial pathogens positive correlations were also found between tetracycline kasugamycin and mls as well as between polymyxin or quinolone and unclassified arg types which suggests similar dynamics and transmission profiles in the hwtss 3 4 key qualitative traits of args of hospital wastewater bacteria higher abundance or diversity of args does not necessarily mean greater risk especially when some important information of args such as their mobility and the host range in a certain environment is missing the characteristics of each type of args need to be further dissected and which arg subtypes and host bacteria need to be considered in priority for amr monitoring and control is yet to be determined once the basic traits of antibiotic resistome e g abundance and richness of args in the examined hwtss were unraveled we further asked how the key traits closely related to the environmental spread e g genetic mobility and human health risk e g host pathogenicity and multi resistance of wastewater args may change before and after wastewater treatment based on metagenome co assembly and binning 94 102 105 unique and high quality mags were recovered from shwts yhwts and zhwts n 24 accounting for 32 0 12 2 20 3 7 0 and 19 5 2 6 of clean metagenomic reads respectively the read percentage represented by recovered mags was in a normal range comparable with that of sewage microbiomes of municipal wastewater treatment plants yuan et al 2021 therein recovered mags represented 39 6 12 9 clean reads of the influent and effluent wastewater metagenomes taxonomically mags recovered from shwts were dominated by proteobacteria 43 bacteroidota 22 actinobacteriota 16 while mags recovered from both yhwts and zhwts were mainly composed of bacteroidota 32 42 firmicutes 32 19 and proteobacteria 14 35 fig 4 revealing great taxonomic heterogeneity between the former and the wastewater microbiota of the two latter hospitals based on reads mapping mags with high abundance sum were consistent with those with high frequency in shwts and zhwts that is mags of proteobacteria bacteroidota and actinobacteriota in shwts and mags of bacteroidota firmicutes and proteobacteria in z hwts both represented more than 95 abundance in the recovered mags respectively however in yhwts campylobacterota and desulfobacterota had only 10 mags and 4 mags respectively but they accounted for more than half 54 7 in the total abundance of in recovered mags notably campylobacterota harbor campylobacteria that largely represented by widely recognized human pathogens e g helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni shiotani et al 2020 bdellovibrionota 6 was uniquely found in shwts which are composed of obligate vibrio shaped predators that can consume some gram negative bacteria inhabiting various environments li et al 2021b previous many studies explored the linkage args with their potential hosts in metagenomic data li et al 2015b luo et al 2017 herein a combination of metagenomic co assembly and binning methods was used to detect taxonomically host of args the high quality mags were focused and inspected to profile their args fig 4 among them 12 11 and 23 mags were identified to encode resistance to multiple classes multi resistant and 28 20 and 24 single resistant single class of antibiotics mags identified from shwts yhwts and zhwts respectively fig 4 the high number of mdr bacteria is especially worrisome these mags encoded various types of args and were not completely eliminated in the effluent as later discussed the args of multidrug and unclassified type were not included in the assembly based analysis for their universal distribution and unverified function overall of all unique mags 107 39 2 were found to contain args encoding resistance to at least one class of antibiotics with bacitracin 65 mls 20 fosmidomycin 19 beta lactam 18 and tetracycline 18 as the five most popular resistance types of args table s4 while the bacitracin resistance encoded in the mags all belonged to baca beta lactam and tetracycline resistance genes were broadly distributed into 17 and 16 subtypes respectively 3 5 host pathogenicity patterns of args in hospital wastewater considering the ecological and human health risks caused by multi drug resistant pathogens these mags predicted to encode args and as pathogens were extracted for further comparative analysis their taxonomic classification abundance distribution resistance type and removal efficiency were illustrated fig 5 there were 39 mags found to be multi resistant which may resistant to more than 1 class of antibiotic there were 20 mags found to be potential pathogens and 80 16 20 mags were resistant therein 12 were multi resistant the basic statistics of 12 mags with both multi resistance and potential pathogenicity were listed in table s4 the args especially multi args hosted by hbps represent a global threat to human health martínez et al 2015 striking example included potential pathogen escherichia flexneri s bin106 aeromonas hydrophila y bin332 and klebsiella pneumoniae z bin130 encoded 11 12 14 args respectively against 7 categories of antibiotics β lactam fosmidomycin bacitracin tetracycline kasugamycin mls and polymyxin potential pathogen z bin145 escherichia flexneri encoded 12 args against β lactam fosmidomycin bacitracin quinolone kasugamycin mls and polymyxin mag based method is a reliable tool to identify and quantify health related strains for microbial risk assessment in the environment liang et al 2020 taxonomically 54 mags with multi resistance or potential pathogenicity all came from the top 4 dominant phyla proteobacteria bacteroidota actinobacteriota and firmicutes in the three hwtss only 15 out of 54 mags mostly in zhwts with multi resistance or potential pathogenicity were removed significantly t test p 0 05 from influent to effluent fig 5 and table s5 suggesting that current disinfection process implemented in the hwtss was not efficient enough for removal of multidrug resistant pathogens such as comamonas thiooxydans aeromonas hydrophila and acinetobacter junii table s3 3 6 co localization patterns between args and mges on mags and plasmids of hospital wastewater bacteria to prioritize monitoring and risk assessment of resistome special attention should be paid to the mobility of args that can be transferred from environmental bacteria to human pathogens or vice versa forsberg et al 2012 we were able to predict and compare the transferability potential of resistance genes at the level of resistance type subtype and ecosystem which is an important aspect of risk ranking for resistance groups the positive correlation between 1 total args and total mges section 3 2 2 specific arg types and mge types section 3 3 both indicated the mobility of args here several co localizations of arg and mge were observed and further suggested the mobile potential of args from genomes of recovered mags there were 17 cases that an arg was located near to a mge 10 kb table s6 including 8 cases that arg ermf aac 3 ⅳ mefa cmxb fosb tet x mefa bla imp 16 were directly adjacent to an mge suggesting its potential mobility fig s5 besides from all contigs of metagenomes assembly there were 236 args were found to locate on the plasmid table s7 more importantly the larg tetx was directly adjacent to an mge of phage integrase family fig 6 a notably the tetx containing mag z bin211 was found with an increase abundance from influent to effluent in all four seasons indicating this microbe successfully survived the treatment and thrived in the hospital effluent plasmids play an important role in the migration and acquisition of args and allow transfer to various microorganisms by horizontal gene transfer in the metagenomic assemblies of three hwtss a total of 2638 args were identified on 2355 contigs and 265 of them were plasmid like contigs specifically args for bacitracin fosmidomycin and kasugamycin were only prevalent in chromosomes 95 args were located on chromosome like contigs these args were potentially stable inheritance by vertical gene transfer while some types of args were prevalent in plasmids e g 45 3 chloramphenicol resistance genes 37 5 sulfonamide resistance genes and 37 0 quinolone resistance genes were found located on plasmid like sequences table s7 therefore these kinds of args with a higher risk of transmission are of a great concern plasmid mediated largs is a new challenge for public health safety our previous results also revealed that largs were frequently borne by plasmids in hospital wastewater zhu et al 2021 so the genetic environment of largs on plasmids were dissected 12 largs were found to locate on the plasmid table s6 and several gene arrangements on plasmids were visualized fig 6b the mcr genes frequently carried by a range of plasmids such as inci2 incx4 incp incx and incfii types wang et al 2017 mcr 3 and mcr 5 also were found to possess discrepant genetic context in s hwts the eama gene is located immediately upstream of the mcr 3 s 145 513 in zhwts mcr 5 was directly adjacent to chromate resistance protein chrb which responsible for chromium resistance nies et al 1990 it suggested the host bacteria of this plasmid might survival in specific selection pressure so some bacteria were obstinate although no bla ndm was detected in these contigs of plasmid the another important larg bla kpc were detected on plasmids for shwts the transposon tnas1 is located upstream of the bla kpc and is iskpn6 was directly adjacent to bla kpc s 191 648 which might greatly facilitate the transfer of bla kpc in wastewater environment fig 6b tnas1 belong to tn3 family and the largs carrying plasmid contig is similar to e coli env103 plasmid psgmcr103 genbank mk731977 1 coverage 71 identifies 100 from ready to eat retail chicken rice in singapore implying its dissemination in cross environments likewise the larg bla kpc was directly adjacent to a mge iskpn6 and an arg bla tem z 308 762 2 bla tem bla kpc iskpn6 in zwts fig 6b these revealed that a range of plasmids as well as an insertion sequence iskpn6 are facilitating the spread of bla kpc genes in hwtss moreover it implied that mdr and high mobility of args were present in hwts 4 conclusion the basic quantitative traits i e diversity an abundance and key qualitative traits of args in the resistome of hospital wastewater treatment systems were profiled using a combination of read based and assembly based metagenomic approaches the basic quantitative trait analyses of args and their association with human bacterial pathogens suggest that the investigated hwtss could reduce the concentration of some args mges and pathogens however there were still considerable persistent args remained in the effluent including larg variants the total abundance of args was correlated with different types of mge indicating that mges potentially influenced the shaping of args moreover our results demonstrated that advanced metagenomic analyses including assembly and binning can gain deep qualitative genomic insights into args in hospital wastewater within the context of their host organisms it is noteworthy that arg containing genera that include clinically important species were also detected including acinetobacter arcobacter streptococcus and escherichia indicating the high risks in hwts effluent and wastewater pipeline network the detection of potential host organisms and genomic context allows for a more accurate risk evaluation associated with hospital wastewater above all the findings highlighted the risk of hospital wastewater based on the diversity abundance mobility and host pathogenicity of args which could also effectively link the

15102,hospital wastewater treatment system hwts is an important source and environmental reservoir of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes args however how antibiotic resistome of clinical wastewater changed in hwts is poorly understood herein the basic quantitative traits i e diversity and abundance of args in three hwtss were profiled by metagenomics in total 709 arg subtypes belonging to 20 arg types were detected with relative abundance ranging from 1 12 10 5 to 7 33 10 1 copies cell notably most args could not be significantly removed by chlorination treatment in the hwts these args were identified to confer resistance to almost all major classes of antibiotics and include args of last resort antibiotics such as bla ndm mcr and tet x which were abundantly occurred in hwts with 19 5 and 7 variants respectively moreover qualitative analysis based on metagenome assembled genome mag analysis revealed that the putative hosts of the identified args were broadly distributed into at least 8 dominant bacterial phyla of the 107 arg carrying mags recovered 39 encoded multi antibiotic resistance and 16 belonged to antibiotic resistant pathogens further analysis of co occurrence patterns of args with mobile genetic elements suggested their potential mobility these key qualitative traits of args provided further information about their phylogeny and genetic context this study sheds light on the key traits of args associated with resistance dissemination and pathogenicity and health risks of clinical wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction the continuous emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance amr have become an enormous threat to human health and ecosystem the world health organization who and the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc classify amr pathogens as an imminent threat to human health who 2014 cdc 2019 currently 700 000 people die each year from infections caused by drug resistant microbes which is predicted to rise to 10 million deaths by 2050 resulting in 100 trillion in lost economic output shankar 2016 amr became the only health issue included in the outcome communique of the leaders summit on 2016 g20 summit in light of this gloomy prospect necessary action should be conducted to tackle antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and recognize the connections between human and animal health and the environment in the one health framework hernando amado et al 2019 hospital wastewater is the hinge of the clinical setting and the environment which has gained attention as an important reservoir and dispersal route of antibiotic resistance determinants the profile of the collection of args i e resistome in hospital wastewater is certainly different from that of other types of wastewaters zhang et al 2020 the risk level of hospital wastewater is further amplified by the extensive use of clinic antibiotics like last resort antibiotics to treat fatal infection the recent emergence of last resort antibiotics resistance mechanism including new delhi metallo β lactamase ndm kumarasamy et al 2010 plasmid mediated colistin resistance mcr liu et al 2016 and high level tigecycline resistance tet x variants he et al 2019 has gained global attention in term of the threat to clinical infections caused by multidrug resistant mdr bacteria the rapid rise in phenotypic resistance to cationic antimicrobial cyclic peptides has challenged renewed interest in colistin as the ultimate line of defense for carbapenem resistant bacterial infections and tet x mediated high level resistance to tigecycline sprang up in the livestock and clinical field subsequently prior studies have mainly used qpcr or high throughput dna sequencing analysis to reveal the effect of chlorine disinfection on last resort args in hospital wastewater loudermilk et al 2022 marathe et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 2021 while these studies provide basic quantitative information of individual args there is still a lack of in depth qualitative knowledge on the key traits of resistome e g resistance mobility host traits and clinical relevance of args found in hospital wastewater limiting our capacity to evaluate their risk to human health compared with qpcr or microarray based studies of args metagenomic studies of environmental resistome especially those based on assembly and binning approaches as recently applied in genome centric metatranscriptomic analysis of urban sewage and activated sludge resistome provided new insights into risk assessment of environmentally found args ju et al 2019 2016 vikesland et al 2017 these approaches have their unique advantages in tracking arg hosts detecting potential pathogenic arbs and exploring the potential of resistance transmission based on the coexistence or co occurrence patterns of args and mobile genetic elements mges in a metagenomic microbiota context liu et al 2019b yuan et al 2021 despite a prominent role of hospital wastewater as the hotspot for the spread of clinically important args marathe et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 to our knowledge a systematic investigation on the presence dynamics and key qualitative traits e g host identity and function of args in hospital wastewater treatment system hwts is lacking although such in depth qualitative insights are essential for the assessment of spread and health risks of amr in hospital wastewater as well as the system efficiency in the removal of clinically important args and resistant pathogens here we comprehensively profiled the antibiotic resistome and tracked their bacterial hosts including human pathogens in the wastewater treatment systems of three local hospitals over four seasons based on shot gun metagenomics and systematic bioinformatics that complementarily integrate regular read based and advanced assembly based metagenomic approaches we analyzed both basic quantitative traits i e diversity and abundance and key qualitative traits i e mobility and host function of args to enhance our knowledge closely associated with the risk assessment of hospital wastewater resistome 1 the diversity and dynamics of args and mges 2 the diversity and dynamics of bacterial pathogens and their correlation with args and mges and 3 the genetic mobility and host traits e g taxonomy pathogenicity and multi resistance of args in the hospital wastewater influents and effluents overall this work expands our horizons on a comprehensive view of the fate and dynamics of antibiotic resistome in hwtss and greatly benefits to environmental and health risk assessments of args 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample origin and collection hospital wastewater samples were collected every

mags from three hwts metagenomes were dereplicated using drep v1 4 3 olm et al 2017 leading to 273 unique and high quality mags 2 4 taxonomy and quantification of mags taxonomy assignment of recovered mags was determined by gtdb tk v0 3 2 chaumeil et al 2019 classify wf phylogenetic analysis of the mags was accomplished using fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 based on 120 bacterial domain specific marker genes from gtdb phylogenetic trees were visualized in itol v6 letunic and bork 2007 online server the relative abundance of mags in their corresponding samples was calculated based on reads recruitment by bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and normalized to reads per kilobase per million rpkm using the following equation r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e n m a p p e d b a s e s l m a g s

metagenome gb 2 5 functional annotation of mags 2 5 1 identification of args and mges on mags orfs predicted from mags by prodigal v2 6 3 were searched against the structured antibiotic resistance gene database sarg v2 0 using ncbi s blastp yin et al 2018 and orfs with a global amino acid identity 60 to any reference sequence were considered as args plasmid sequences in all assembled contigs was predicted by plasflow v1 1 krawczyk et al 2018 with parameter threshold 0 95 the plasmid associated genes were annotated by blastp against ncbi nr database using parameter max target seqs 1 if the arg were found located on the predicted plasmid contigs the arg were regarded as plasmid associated arg then mges were identified by hmmsearch v3 3 2 finn et al 2011 against pfam v34 0 finn et al 2016 followed by keywords match to mges e g insertion sequence iss integrase transposase and plasmid ju et al 2019 the args that either located on a plasmid contig or nearby with an mge 10 kb was considered with potential mobility 2 5 2 identification of pathogenic genes and genomes the identification of potentially pathogenic mags was performed as described in reference yuan et al 2021 briefly potentially pathogenic mags were firstly identified based on the earlier published pathogen lists containing 140 human pathogenic genera and 538 human pathogenic species ju et al 2016 woolhouse and gowtage sequeria 2005 and further verified the presence of virulence factors in the genome by blastp against virulence factor database vfdb liu et al 2019a with a global amino acid identity 70 2 6 statistical and network analyses the abundance of arg types were represented using the circos program krzywinski et al 2009 the phylogenetic tree with heatmap of pathogens was acquired from mega7 maximum likelihood tree with 1000 bootstraps and evolview subramanian et al 2019 pearson s correlation was used to analyze the relationship between args mges and pathogens boxplots bubble graph and line regression were performed with r version 3 5 1 with ggplot2 wickham 2009 and vegan packages oksanen et al 2011 the network was visualized with cytoscape 3 3 0 shannon et al 2003 one way analysis of variance anova was used to assess statistical significance of group difference using spss v22 0 ibm usa where p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the difference in the abundance of args between the influent and effluent was determined by the mann whitney u test where adjusted p 0 05 was considered significant 2 7 data availability the raw sequencing data generated from shotgun metagenomes in this study has been deposited with the ncbi sra prjna675192 other data of this study are available from the authors upon request 3 results and discussion 3 1 diversity and dynamics of args in hwtss in this study wastewater influent and effluent samples from hwtss of three hospitals were collected in four seasons i e spring summer autumn and winter to obtain a comprehensive profile of antibiotic resistomes and microbiota the 24 wastewater samples contained a total of 20 arg types i e resistance types and 709 arg subtypes i e resistance genes which accounted respectively for 80 25 of types and 57 1244 of subtypes of args in the sarg v2 0 databases and conferred resistance to almost all common classes of antibiotics highlighting that hospital wastewater is a potential major conduit for the release of args into the environment resistance gene profiles showed that the five abundant arg types accounted for 75 8 of the total args figs 1 a s1 beta lactam 19 2 7 33 10 1 copies cell aminoglycoside 18 5 7 17 10 1 copies cell multidrug 13 9 5 29 10 1 copies cell sulfonamide 13 0 4 95 10 1 copies cell and tetracycline 11 2 4 30 10 1 copies cell the distribution of arg profiles in influent and effluent was type dependent for example some args were more abundant in influents compared to effluents those against bleomycin chloramphenicol fosfomycin fosmidomycin kasugamycin macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls polymyxin puromycin rifamycin tetracenomycin c tetracycline vancomycin and unclassified resistance genes fig s1 among three hwtss only 9 arg types i e bleomycin chloramphenicol fosfomycin tetracycline mls quinolone polymyxin kasugamycin fosmidomycin rifamycin vancomycin and unclassified resistance genes in zhwts could be significantly removed by chlorination treatment p 0 05 fig 1a other arg types were more abundant in effluent they may be associated to mges and dominate the resistome of hwts che et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the heatmap of the top 30 args revealed that sul1 4 14 10 1 copies cell aada 2 61 10 1 copies cell aac 6 i 2 15 10 1 copies cell qace 1 95 10 1 copies cell dominant args in influents and sul1 3 60 10 1 copies cell aada 2 00 10 1 copies cell ermf 1 76 10 1 copies cell tetq 1 73 10 1 copies cell herein among all targeted 1244 args 97 args were found in all samples these are persistent args not removed by chlorination treatment their relative abundance had no significant difference among seasons p 0 5 suggesting that temperature does not significantly affect the variation of persistent args fig s2 with the marked increase in the frequency of mdr bacteria and the limited availability of novel antibiotics the carbapenems colistin and tigecycline have been regard as last resort antibiotics over the past decades our recent study emphasized the distribution and genetic context of last resort args largs bacteria by qpcr and whole genome sequencing in hwtss the result showed that largs might accelerate the occurrence of superbugs zhu et al 2021 largs bla ndm mcr and tet x were abundant in hwts with 19 5 and 7 variants respectively in the last six years an increasing number of mcr variants 10 in total so far have been identified and placed at different positions in the phylogenies the most abundant last resort antibiotic resistance subtypes were mcr 3 and tet x2 based on the metagenomics data for hwtss fig 1c on the whole the highest relative abundance larg was tet x 0 to 8 90 10 2 copies cells in influents and 0 to 6 92 10 3 copies cells in effluents with an average of 7 39 10 3 copies cell in influents and 5 61 10 3 copies cell in effluents for bla ndm and mcr the average relative abundances in influents were 6 38 10 4 and 2 76 10 3 copies cell respectively whereas those in effluents were 1 79 10 4 and 4 06 10 4 copies cell respectively fig 1d the relative abundance of largs in influents were much higher than in effluents fig 1d p 0 05 our previous results based on qpcr analysis showed that most larg variants mcr 1 mcr 2 and tet x1 tet x5 in effluents exhibited significantly lower absolute abundance than those in influents p 0 01 or p 0 05 zhu et al 2021 these findings indicated that chlorine disinfection could effectively reduce the absolute copies l and relative abundance copies cell of most largs however the wastewater ecosystem is still a vital pool of the larg facilitating the coupling bla ndm mcr and tet x on the same plasmid which posed a significant risk to the clinic and human health 3 2 diversity and dynamics of mges in hwts mges represent a key feature for gram negative bacteria to adapt to their environment especially when selective pressures are present hgt via mges is believed to be the underlying mechanism responsible for the spread of args ellabaan et al 2021 hospital wastewaters may present optimal conditions for horizontal gene exchange via mges high cell density nutrient rich environment and constant contact between antibiotics and arb as well as donor and recipient bacteria hocquet et al 2016 in total 396 insertion sequences iss 239 integrons and 522 plasmids were identified in hwts metagenomes the relative abundance of iss was significantly higher than that of plasmids and integrons p 0 05 fig 2 a overall lower relative abundance of mges in effluents than that of influents were detectable in three hwtss specifically the relative abundance of iss integrons and plasmids in influents were 1 74 1 20 and 1 33 fold that of effluents respectively but only for zhwts the removes of mges by chlorination were significant p 0 05 fig 2a interestingly we observed lower relative abundance of mges in influent than in some effluents e g in spring and summer for influent and effluent samples of shwts like in other environments tian et al 2016 total args showed significant positive correlation with total mges iss integrons and plasmids in influents of hwtss with r 0 886 0 859 0 885 and 0 804 respectively p 0 01 fig 2b suggesting that most args from human gut might be highly mobile more interesting total args showed much lower positive correlation with total mges iss integrons and plasmids r 0 577 0 484 0 635 and 0 929 in effluents of hwtss p 0 01 fig 2c respectively the contrasting results between wastewater influent and effluent samples implied that the chlorination treatment selectively killed some arg carrying bacteria in the influent and the debris of genome and plasmids resulted in the decoupling of co occurrence of args and mges 3 3 diversity and dynamics of bacterial pathogens in hwtss considering clinic particularity it is inevitable that hospital wastewater should harbor diverse and abundant pathogens despite significant improvements in wastewater treatment and management water borne diseases caused by pathogens still account for about 4 of the total mortality rate and 5 7 of total disease burden prüss et al 2002 it was difficult to classify clades at the species level with traditional 16s rrna gene sequence analysis but shotgun metagenome sequencing was useful to identify disease associated taxa metagenomic reads based analysis results showed that the study identified diversified pathogenicity associated clades in hwts the composition of the bacterial community at the phylum level showed proteobacteria 44 2 bacteroidetes 35 5 firmicutes 12 5 and actinobacteria 2 9 as the most dominant microbes fig s3 in three hwtss betaproteobacteria 17 9 and bacteroidia 15 9 made up a significant portion of the total population fig s4 a total of 353 pathogenic bacteria compare with the list of bacterial pathogens in a previous study li et al 2015a were detected fig 3 a arcobacter bacteroides aeromonas acinetobacter and enterobacteriaceae were found in both influents and effluents which of removal rate were 52 7 79 2 some important clinic pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa removal rate 88 0 streptococcus suis removal rate 87 2 acinetobacter johnsonii removal rate 80 1 staphylococcus aureus removal rate 77 0 acinetobacter baumannii removal rate 23 6 klebsiella pneumonia removal rate 24 8 vibrio cholera removal rate 13 8 and haemophilus influenza removal rate 22 6 were identified based on their relative abundances table s3 their abundance was lower in the effluent fig 3a suggesting that wastewater chlorination treatment can reduce the relative abundance of some hbps however many important causative organisms like e coli 2 60 10 4 a baumannii 2 38 10 4 a johnsonii 2 01 10 4 k pneumonia 1 03 10 4 or pseudomonas 2 98 10 3 were abundant in the treated effluents fig 3a table s3 this suggests that despite chlorination the risk of waterborne diseases in these effluents remains high pathogenic bacteria are more susceptible to acquire and spread args than nonpathogenic bacteria wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 and strong links between args mges and pathogens were also observed in our study fig 3b for example args encoding beta lactam resistance were strongly associated r 0 8 p 0 01 to multiple mges 6 plasmids and 3 integrons and crucial pathogens e g salmonella enterica r 0 87 p 0 01 the latter is among the most important foodborne pathogens globally who 2018 plasmids and integrons may contribute to the spread of β lactam args in both non pathogens and pathogens multidrug resistant mdr s enterica is prevalent in parts of asia and africa mejia et al 2021 and β lactam resistant s enterica is difficult to treat in the clinic kuang et al 2018 given the high proportion 85 of args strongly associated with mges args from the clinic may be introduced into the environment via hwts and transmitted to pathogens co occurrence patterns of arg types mges and bacterial pathogens were also explored using network analysis fig 3b significant correlations existed among kasugamycin tetracycline and mls with mges and certain pathogens which might be attributed to the coexistence of these resistance genes and mges in many clinical bacterial genomes these results reveal an important role for mges in args dissemination in the environment by increased accessibility to bacterial pathogens positive correlations were also found between tetracycline kasugamycin and mls as well as between polymyxin or quinolone and unclassified arg types which suggests similar dynamics and transmission profiles in the hwtss 3 4 key qualitative traits of args of hospital wastewater bacteria higher abundance or diversity of args does not necessarily mean greater risk especially when some important information of args such as their mobility and the host range in a certain environment is missing the characteristics of each type of args need to be further dissected and which arg subtypes and host bacteria need to be considered in priority for amr monitoring and control is yet to be determined once the basic traits of antibiotic resistome e g abundance and richness of args in the examined hwtss were unraveled we further asked how the key traits closely related to the environmental spread e g genetic mobility and human health risk e g host pathogenicity and multi resistance of wastewater args may change before and after wastewater treatment based on metagenome co assembly and binning 94 102 105 unique and high quality mags were recovered from shwts yhwts and zhwts n 24 accounting for 32 0 12 2 20 3 7 0 and 19 5 2 6 of clean metagenomic reads respectively the read percentage represented by recovered mags was in a normal range comparable with that of sewage microbiomes of municipal wastewater treatment plants yuan et al 2021 therein recovered mags represented 39 6 12 9 clean reads of the influent and effluent wastewater metagenomes taxonomically mags recovered from shwts were dominated by proteobacteria 43 bacteroidota 22 actinobacteriota 16 while mags recovered from both yhwts and zhwts were mainly composed of bacteroidota 32 42 firmicutes 32 19 and proteobacteria 14 35 fig 4 revealing great taxonomic heterogeneity between the former and the wastewater microbiota of the two latter hospitals based on reads mapping mags with high abundance sum were consistent with those with high frequency in shwts and zhwts that is mags of proteobacteria bacteroidota and actinobacteriota in shwts and mags of bacteroidota firmicutes and proteobacteria in z hwts both represented more than 95 abundance in the recovered mags respectively however in yhwts campylobacterota and desulfobacterota had only 10 mags and 4 mags respectively but they accounted for more than half 54 7 in the total abundance of in recovered mags notably campylobacterota harbor campylobacteria that largely represented by widely recognized human pathogens e g helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni shiotani et al 2020 bdellovibrionota 6 was uniquely found in shwts which are composed of obligate vibrio shaped predators that can consume some gram negative bacteria inhabiting various environments li et al 2021b previous many studies explored the linkage args with their potential hosts in metagenomic data li et al 2015b luo et al 2017 herein a combination of metagenomic co assembly and binning methods was used to detect taxonomically host of args the high quality mags were focused and inspected to profile their args fig 4 among them 12 11 and 23 mags were identified to encode resistance to multiple classes multi resistant and 28 20 and 24 single resistant single class of antibiotics mags identified from shwts yhwts and zhwts respectively fig 4 the high number of mdr bacteria is especially worrisome these mags encoded various types of args and were not completely eliminated in the effluent as later discussed the args of multidrug and unclassified type were not included in the assembly based analysis for their universal distribution and unverified function overall of all unique mags 107 39 2 were found to contain args encoding resistance to at least one class of antibiotics with bacitracin 65 mls 20 fosmidomycin 19 beta lactam 18 and tetracycline 18 as the five most popular resistance types of args table s4 while the bacitracin resistance encoded in the mags all belonged to baca beta lactam and tetracycline resistance genes were broadly distributed into 17 and 16 subtypes respectively 3 5 host pathogenicity patterns of args in hospital wastewater considering the ecological and human health risks caused by multi drug resistant pathogens these mags predicted to encode args and as pathogens were extracted for further comparative analysis their taxonomic classification abundance distribution resistance type and removal efficiency were illustrated fig 5 there were 39 mags found to be multi resistant which may resistant to more than 1 class of antibiotic there were 20 mags found to be potential pathogens and 80 16 20 mags were resistant therein 12 were multi resistant the basic statistics of 12 mags with both multi resistance and potential pathogenicity were listed in table s4 the args especially multi args hosted by hbps represent a global threat to human health martínez et al 2015 striking example included potential pathogen escherichia flexneri s bin106 aeromonas hydrophila y bin332 and klebsiella pneumoniae z bin130 encoded 11 12 14 args respectively against 7 categories of antibiotics β lactam fosmidomycin bacitracin tetracycline kasugamycin mls and polymyxin potential pathogen z bin145 escherichia flexneri encoded 12 args against β lactam fosmidomycin bacitracin quinolone kasugamycin mls and polymyxin mag based method is a reliable tool to identify and quantify health related strains for microbial risk assessment in the environment liang et al 2020 taxonomically 54 mags with multi resistance or potential pathogenicity all came from the top 4 dominant phyla proteobacteria bacteroidota actinobacteriota and firmicutes in the three hwtss only 15 out of 54 mags mostly in zhwts with multi resistance or potential pathogenicity were removed significantly t test p 0 05 from influent to effluent fig 5 and table s5 suggesting that current disinfection process implemented in the hwtss was not efficient enough for removal of multidrug resistant pathogens such as comamonas thiooxydans aeromonas hydrophila and acinetobacter junii table s3 3 6 co localization patterns between args and mges on mags and plasmids of hospital wastewater bacteria to prioritize monitoring and risk assessment of resistome special attention should be paid to the mobility of args that can be transferred from environmental bacteria to human pathogens or vice versa forsberg et al 2012 we were able to predict and compare the transferability potential of resistance genes at the level of resistance type subtype and ecosystem which is an important aspect of risk ranking for resistance groups the positive correlation between 1 total args and total mges section 3 2 2 specific arg types and mge types section 3 3 both indicated the mobility of args here several co localizations of arg and mge were observed and further suggested the mobile potential of args from genomes of recovered mags there were 17 cases that an arg was located near to a mge 10 kb table s6 including 8 cases that arg ermf aac 3 ⅳ mefa cmxb fosb tet x mefa bla imp 16 were directly adjacent to an mge suggesting its potential mobility fig s5 besides from all contigs of metagenomes assembly there were 236 args were found to locate on the plasmid table s7 more importantly the larg tetx was directly adjacent to an mge of phage integrase family fig 6 a notably the tetx containing mag z bin211 was found with an increase abundance from influent to effluent in all four seasons indicating this microbe successfully survived the treatment and thrived in the hospital effluent plasmids play an important role in the migration and acquisition of args and allow transfer to various microorganisms by horizontal gene transfer in the metagenomic assemblies of three hwtss a total of 2638 args were identified on 2355 contigs and 265 of them were plasmid like contigs specifically args for bacitracin fosmidomycin and kasugamycin were only prevalent in chromosomes 95 args were located on chromosome like contigs these args were potentially stable inheritance by vertical gene transfer while some types of args were prevalent in plasmids e g 45 3 chloramphenicol resistance genes 37 5 sulfonamide resistance genes and 37 0 quinolone resistance genes were found located on plasmid like sequences table s7 therefore these kinds of args with a higher risk of transmission are of a great concern plasmid mediated largs is a new challenge for public health safety our previous results also revealed that largs were frequently borne by plasmids in hospital wastewater zhu et al 2021 so the genetic environment of largs on plasmids were dissected 12 largs were found to locate on the plasmid table s6 and several gene arrangements on plasmids were visualized fig 6b the mcr genes frequently carried by a range of plasmids such as inci2 incx4 incp incx and incfii types wang et al 2017 mcr 3 and mcr 5 also were found to possess discrepant genetic context in s hwts the eama gene is located immediately upstream of the mcr 3 s 145 513 in zhwts mcr 5 was directly adjacent to chromate resistance protein chrb which responsible for chromium resistance nies et al 1990 it suggested the host bacteria of this plasmid might survival in specific selection pressure so some bacteria were obstinate although no bla ndm was detected in these contigs of plasmid the another important larg bla kpc were detected on plasmids for shwts the transposon tnas1 is located upstream of the bla kpc and is iskpn6 was directly adjacent to bla kpc s 191 648 which might greatly facilitate the transfer of bla kpc in wastewater environment fig 6b tnas1 belong to tn3 family and the largs carrying plasmid contig is similar to e coli env103 plasmid psgmcr103 genbank mk731977 1 coverage 71 identifies 100 from ready to eat retail chicken rice in singapore implying its dissemination in cross environments likewise the larg bla kpc was directly adjacent to a mge iskpn6 and an arg bla tem z 308 762 2 bla tem bla kpc iskpn6 in zwts fig 6b these revealed that a range of plasmids as well as an insertion sequence iskpn6 are facilitating the spread of bla kpc genes in hwtss moreover it implied that mdr and high mobility of args were present in hwts 4 conclusion the basic quantitative traits i e diversity an abundance and key qualitative traits of args in the resistome of hospital wastewater treatment systems were profiled using a combination of read based and assembly based metagenomic approaches the basic quantitative trait analyses of args and their association with human bacterial pathogens suggest that the investigated hwtss could reduce the concentration of some args mges and pathogens however there were still considerable persistent args remained in the effluent including larg variants the total abundance of args was correlated with different types of mge indicating that mges potentially influenced the shaping of args moreover our results demonstrated that advanced metagenomic analyses including assembly and binning can gain deep qualitative genomic insights into args in hospital wastewater within the context of their host organisms it is noteworthy that arg containing genera that include clinically important species were also detected including acinetobacter arcobacter streptococcus and escherichia indicating the high risks in hwts effluent and wastewater pipeline network the detection of potential host organisms and genomic context allows for a more accurate risk evaluation associated with hospital wastewater above all the findings highlighted the risk of hospital wastewater based on the diversity abundance mobility and host pathogenicity of args which could also effectively link the risk of args between the clinic and wastewater environment author contributions hc and lz conceived and designed the project lz xs and zl collected samples lz xs and ys conducted experimental progress

antibiotics in the reclaimed water can induce stress on aquifer system reshape microbial community and affect the emergence and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args in this study three sandy soil columns h 1 5 m id 14 cm were employed to simulate mar and synthetic reclaimed water containing either amoxicillin amo ampicillin amp or oxacillin oxa was continuously recharged for 120 d the temporal and spatial attenuation of β lactams and nitrogen was studied and microbial collaboration and the resistance mechanism were elaborated biodegradation is the main pathway for β lactams elimination amo and amp were eliminated when migrating 30 cm while the attenuation of oxa experienced in the whole column with final removal efficiency of 82 moreover refractory oxa induced more args production and approximately 10 and 13 higher than that of amo and amp columns efflux pump and antibiotics inactivation were the two major resistance mechanisms no3 n gradually decreased by 26 38 and 49 for amo amp and oxa respectively along the recharge direction microbial co occurrence network revealed that nitrogen cycling bacteria were the keystone species in aquifer community and ammonation provided nh4 n for the nitrification process of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa promoting the further denitrification for nitrogen removal in mar process nitrogen cycling bacteria were the key and active arg hosts which could keep nitrogen transformation activity under antibiotics stress in sum nitrogen cycling bacteria exhibited intimate collaboration and elastic resistance in response to the

groundwater urban rivers lakes and even drinking water tortajada and van rensburg 2020 municipal wastewater is the main source of reclaimed water because of its sustainable quantity and reliable quality zhu and dou 2018 to balance the temporal and spatial differences between reclaimed water production and demand ecological storage technologies are usually conjunctively applied asano and cotruvo 2004 dillon et al 2018 as this approach is effective for alleviating water shortages enhancing water security preventing water quality deterioration and mitigating decreases in the water table alam et al 2021 cui et al 2018 long et al 2020 managed aquifer recharge mar provides an idea to achieve water sustainability and it refers to the purposeful recharge of excess reclaimed wastewater to aquifers xia et al 2020 mar has been implemented in more than 60 countries to date especially in the united states europe and australia dillon et al 2020 rinck pfeiffer et al 2010 vandenbohede et al 2009 one of the most well known mar projects is the central arizona project cap which has been running for more than thirty years milman et al 2021 the 542 km cap system delivers more than 1850 million cubic meters per year and it uses the underground water bank as a reservoir and transport system megdal et al 2014 in mar facilities the aquifer is not only a pool for reclaimed water storage but also acts as a natural barrier that continuously purifies the recharging water li et al 2013 microflocculation sedimentation adsorption and filtration along with biotransformation contribute to the reduction in contaminants and the major contribution to the attenuation of contaminants is thought to be mostly due to the latter regnery et al 2017 2015 for example the removal efficiencies of contaminants more than 10 pharmaceutically active compounds including ibuprofen naproxen and caffeine were less than 33 under abiotic conditions while the removal efficiencies of these contaminants were greater than 75 under biotic conditions during soil passage in the simulated mar reactors maeng et al 2011a overall microbial communities catalyze key biogeochemical processes during mar which affects carbon and nitrogen turnover and attenuation fillinger et al 2021 although the storage of reclaimed water to subsurface is an attractive option it is important to understand the ecological risks arising from raw water it was found that even advanced oxidation reverse osmosis and disinfection processes were conducted thus there were still antibiotics remained in the reclaimed water maeng et al 2011b consequently antibiotics are frequently detected in reclaimed water and groundwater systems receiving reclaimed water christou et al 2017 β lactam antibiotics account for more than 65 of the global antibiotic market they have been frequently detected at high concentrations μg l to mg l in various environments such as natural water bodies and reclaimed water saitoh and shibayama 2016 zhang et al 2021 the β lactam antibiotics are comprised of a great variety of semisynthetic penicillins such as amoxicillin ampicillin penicillin and oxacillin cha et al 2006 the discrepancies in chemical structure among β lactams lead to difference in toxicity and biodegradability sanderson et al 2004 for example the acute toxicity to fish of amoxicillin ampicillin and oxacillin are 184 1530 and 1 90 mg l respectively table s1 it seems the removal performance of β lactams is largely relied on their physicochemical properties biodegradability and toxicity the presence of antibiotics continuously imposes selective pressure on aquifer microorganisms and results in the proliferation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args during mar an et al 2018 christou et al 2017 reclaimed water is considered a point source of antibiotics and args in freshwater lake sediments czekalski et al 2014 michael et al 2013 reclaimed water irrigation and recharge could result in the enrichment of args in urban park soil as the abundance of args is positively correlated with the concentration of antibiotics wang et al 2014 besides aquifer recharge with stormwater caused the prevalence of args and virulence genes in biofilms sidhu et al 2020 all these studies indicate that the subsurface storage of reclaimed water is an effective strategy but the drawback is that it has a rather large migration range of antibiotics and brings the risk of polluting groundwater and spreading antibiotic resistance one of the key issues of mar is the emerging antibiotics in the recharging regions which induced microbial regulations and even ecological risk theoretically persistence and refractory of the antibiotics could cause the functional microorganisms triggered different resistance mechanisms to achieve self rescue in this study three β lactam antibiotics with significant difference in acute toxicity and biodegradability see table s1 amo amp and oxa were recharged to simulated mar system respectively the temporal and spatial attenuation of the β lactams was investigated and especially their effects on microbial community regulation and args productions were elaborated the self rescue capability of nitrogen cycling bacteria was verified via microbial network collaborations we showed for the first time that the collaboration network of nitrogen cycling bacteria contributed to the stability and resistance of microbial community during mar 2 materials and methods 2 1 mar experimental set up the simulated aquifer recharge experiments were conducted

2015 michael et al 2013 amoxicillin amo ampicillin amp and oxacillin oxa with concentration of 100 μg l aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china was recharged into three simulated mar system respectively due to the significant differences of oxa on acute toxics and biodegradability with amo and amp we compared oxa with the other two throughout this report the physicochemical properties and toxicity data of three β lactam antibiotics were listed in table s1 2 3 adsorbing capability sorption influences the migration distance and biodegradation efficiency of β lactams thus batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the adsorbing capability of aquifer sediment to β lactams following previous studies ma et al 2021 ying et al 2008 sterilized soil 10 g was mixed with 200 ml of ultra filtered 0 22 μm labfilter usa β lactams solution in 250 ml conical flasks to reach a soil solution ratio of 1 20 w w and negative control was also conducted without aquifer sediment addition then each stock solution of β lactams was spiked to flasks and the final concentrations were 0 05 0 10 0 20 0 50 and 1 00 mg l respectively all flasks were placed on a mechanical shaker at 30 rpm and incubated in the dark at 15 c for an equilibration period of 24 h after equilibration the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber microfilter and the concentrations of β lactams were measured two sorption isotherms linear and freundlich were used to fit the sorption of three β lactams the soil partition coefficient kd l kg and freundlich coefficient kf μg1 nln kg were calculated based on the

bacteria at the phylum level network analysis was conducted using r software and the results were visualized using gephi software spearman s correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationships among dominant genera and the co occurrence patterns between args and dominant genera the connections were considered strongly correlated according to the following criteria spearman s r 0 6 or r 0 6 and p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of β lactam antibiotics during mar 3 1 1 sorption of β lactams the soil water partition coefficient is an important parameter for evaluating the potential of contaminants to leach into groundwater which is typically described using the linear model and freundlich model the freundlich coefficient kf of oxa fitted by the freundlich isotherm was 5 5 which was 17 3 of amo and 14 0 of amp respectively table 1 kd soil partition coefficient and r retardation factor values of oxa were lower than those of amp and amo indicating that oxa was more easily transported to groundwater compounds with a kd value 500 l kg are considered capable of weak sorption affinity qiu et al 2021 therefore the sorption of the three β lactams in the column was weak and biodegradation was considered the main pathway for β lactams elimination in aquifers simultaneously a negative control was also conducted and found that negligible degradation of three β lactams without aquifer sediment addition 3 1 2 attenuation of organics variations in the three β lactams at the steady stage after 120 d of operation along with the travel distance is shown in fig 2 a most of the recharged amo and amp was eliminated when migrating 30 cm while the attenuation of oxa experienced in the whole column and had a final removal efficiency of 82 in comparison to amo and amp the first order degradation kinetic constant k according to eq s1 of oxa was an order of magnitude lower than that of amo and amp which was attributed to its more stable structure and weak sorption affinity oxa features an isoxazole ring which deteriorated the steric effect and negatively affected enzyme biocatalysis estrada flórez et al 2020 glucose as an easily biodegradable substrate that was depleted within 10 cm fig 2b it probably served as the co substrate to activate non specific enzymes including hydrolases lyases transferases and oxidoreductases zhang et al 2022b there was no significant discrepancy most p 0 05 in doc removal among the three columns under exposure to 100 ug l of antibiotics fig 2b approximately 45 3 of influent doc was degraded in the top 30 cm sediment layer the surface layer of recharge and infiltration was considered the biologically active layer and doc removal was dominant within this area maeng et al 2011b doc gradually stabilized after 60 cm of travel and 1 5 mg l remained in the effluent fig s1 showed the epss content at 15 cm sampling ports were significantly higher than other sampling sites since higher carbon source in influent caused the enrichment of microorganisms and the residual doc was mainly attributed to the soluble microbial products smps leached from the sediment quanrud et al 2003 wang et al 2021a this portion of doc represents an addition carbon pool that could serve as a growth substrate for microorganism haynes et al 2007 variation in β lactams and doc during long term operation is shown in fig 2c high removal performance was observed for amo and amp and the average removal performance was greater than 95 during the whole operation period however the oxa removal was fluctuant compared with amo and amp oxa brought higher toxicity to microorganisms during the first 40 days microorganisms were gradually adapted to the stress of oxa and oxa in the effluents hereafter oxa removal was improved while approximately 15 μg l oxa still remained in the effluents after 40 d the doc of the three columns was stabilized at 1 5 to 2 5 mg l which corresponded to a removal performance of 33 3 60 0 although the attenuation of the three β lactams varied temporally and spatially there was no substantial variation in doc removal 3 1 3 characteristics of microbial community as shown in fig 3 microbial community compositions after long term exposure to three β lactams were compared it showed that microbial community structures were similar among different columns and layers but attained different abundances acinetobacter geobacter and sphingobium were dominant in three columns sphingobium was reported to be candidate β lactams degradation species related genera zhang et al 2022a zhao et al 2020 acinetobacter and geobacter are typical denitrifying bacteria dnb yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022c while their abundances were higher in oxa column compared with amo and amp columns indicating the higher potentials to denitrify on oxa column amo and amp were quickly degraded during the top 30 cm of the column correspondingly geobacter magnetospirillum and zoogloea were dominant at this layer which might be candidate β lactams degradation genera however geobacter and pedosphaera might contribute to oxa degradation geobacter is a widely studied electroactive bacterium that can mineralize refractory organic matter through extracellular electron transfer process wu et al 2023 xiao et al 2021 the scarcity of organic carbon in the aquifer also led to the enrichment of several autotrophic microorganisms including bradyrhizobium sulfuritalea and thiobacillus which can use sulfur compounds and metal as electron donors for denitrification tang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 ca nitrosotalea ca nitrosotenuis and nitrososphaera are typical ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa which have a stronger affinity for nh4 n than traditional ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob xu et al 2021 nitrospira is typical nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for above nitrification microorganisms their abundances of oxa were lower than that of amp and amo overall the majority of microorganisms participate in nitrogen transformation which must lead to the variations of nitrogen 3 1 4 diversity and occurrence of args there was significant difference in β lactams removal during reclaimed water recharging which also caused the discrepancy in args production as shown in fig 4 a total of 311 arg subtypes and 21 arg types were identified from aquifer sediment samples the largest dominant arg type was multidrug 21 4 followed by beta lactamase 16 1 fluoroquinolone 12 2 tetracycline 11 3 and aminoglycoside 11 2 due to the refractory characteristics of oxa the total abundance of args in the oxa columns was 10 and 13 higher than that of amo and amp columns respectively the abundance was highest in the layer at the end oxa 135 in sum the incomplete removal of β lactams induced more considerable risks in arg spreading efflux pump and antibiotics inactivation were the two major resistance mechanisms of aquifer microbes more than 80 of all microbes antibiotic efflux proteins are located in bacterial cell membranes and participated in the excretion of toxic molecules from the host bacteria which mainly results in the enrichment of multidrug resistance genes zhu et al 2017 beta lactamase genes detected in this study were all mediated by antibiotics inactivation which promoted the degradation of β lactams zhang et al 2021 3 2 nitrogen removal and microbial response 3 2 1 transformation of nitrogen variations in nitrogen along the travel distance at the steady stage after 120 days are shown in fig 5 a d influent nh4 n 1 mg l was completely removed within the first 15 cm migration probably via aquifer sorption aerobic ammonium oxidization and microbial assimilation and there was no accumulation of no2 n in the effluent unlike doc removals no3 n removal occurred along the whole column and exposure to different β lactams caused varied no3 n removal efficiencies the removal efficiencies of no3 n for the amo amp and oxa columns were 26 38 and 49 respectively we also observed that no3 n removal occurred constantly was even though easily degradable organic carbon was exhausted smps could be the candidate electron donors for denitrification fig s1 furthermore considerable dissolved inorganic carbon dic released from aquifer sediment which could be another electron donor for autotrophic denitrification fig s2 we deduced that both autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification contributed to no3 n removal consistently the profile of tn within 15 135 cm showed a similar tendency to that of no3 n no3 n and tn concentrations began to decline and gradually stabilized after 40 days of acclimation fig 5e averaged residual concentrations of no3 n and tn of oxa column were 1 5 and 2 1 mg l respectively which were lower than those of amp and amo this suggests that the migration of β lactams was accompanied by nitrogen removal and residual antibiotics improved nitrogen transformation thus nitrogen transforming microorganisms might be carriers of args 3 2 2 response of nitrogen cycling bacteria there was significant discrepancy in nitrogen removal under the stress of three β lactams thus we performed a detailed analysis of nitrogen cycling bacteria and functional genes fig 6 from the layer of 15 cm to 135 cm the total abundance of dominant dnb showed an increasing tendency in oxa column while it was declined in both amp and amo columns correspondingly there was also the highest abundance of denitrification gene enriched in the oxa column fig 6b which led to the higher no3 n removal among various dnb acinetobacter and geobacter were dominant in all sediment samples for oxa column the abundance of acinetobacter reached 6 1 at the layer of 135 cm which was significant higher than that of amp and amo correspondingly the most args were enriched at this layer of oxa column previous study reported the multidrug resistant acinetobacter was isolated thus it might be the main arg host maravić et al 2015 for the three columns nh4 n was completely removed within the top 15 cm while the abundances of nitrification genes amo and hao exhibited the higher abundances at 75 cm and 135 cm than that of 15 cm which suggested that nitrification activity was higher at deeper sediment layers albeit no nh4 n was detected at these depths correspondingly more ca nitrosotenuis and nitrososphaera were enriched microbial ammonation process releases ammonia and the abundance of pseudomonas was gradually increased along the recharge direction fig 6a trung tran et al 2019 therefore ammonium oxidation occurred to the whole recharge height causing the enrichment of aoa and nob along the three columns 3 3 self rescue of nitrogen cycling bacteria 3 3 1 microbial resistance although amo and amp were removed when migrating 30 cm args still spread in whole column and oxa column possessed more args thus whether or not the antibiotic was degraded it caused the spread of arg it is necessary to explain the host of args in order to preliminarily explore the main host of args after β lactams exposure during mar the host identify of args were based on all sediment samples collected in this study co occurrence patterns between microbial communities and args based on network analysis can provide insights into arg hosts zhao et al 2021 the network consisted of 84 nodes 34 genera and 50 arg subtypes and 134 edges and a strong positive correlation was observed spearman s r 0 6 p 0 05 fig 7 eleven genera were considered as potential arg hosts and the number of connections of args was greater than five table s4 among the arg hosts acinetobacter and sphingobium were both correlated with four beta lactamase arg subtypes oxa 211 adc 8 nps 1 and carb 21 we deduced that these two might be the key functional bacteria associated with the degradation of β lactams the genera acinetobacter ca accumulibacter deferrisoma pseudomonas geobacter sphingomonas and sulfuritalea conducted denitrification function were also the hosts of args these dnb could maintain denitrification activity and antibiotic resistance during mar these findings are consistent with the results of previous studies of activated sludge process and solid phase denitrification reactors feng et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 in addition ca nitrosotenuis were the active hosts of args and harbored the most arg subtypes overall we found that nitrogen cycling bacteria were the main hosts of args 3 3 2 microbial cooperation to identify the keystone species and explore potential interactions among taxa in the microbial community network analysis of the dominant genera was carried out based on spearman s correlation coefficients r 0 6 fig 8 highly connected nodes represent keystone species which are the key drivers of many ecological processes and play an intrinsic role in maintaining the stabilization of microbial community banerjee et al 2018 the keystone species in the mar system include ca nitrosotenuis ca accumulibacter sulfuritalea geobacter nitrososphaera and nitrospira these genera involved in nitrogen metabolism and further demonstrated that the importance of nitrogen cycling bacteria in aquifer microbial communities co occurrence network analysis reveals the coordination cooperation and competition relationships among microbial taxa positively correlated connections comprised approximately 60 of all connections demonstrating that cooperation is the predominant interaction mechanism of aquifer microorganisms during mar table s5 and fig 8 typical cooperative interactions included 1 the decomposition of organic matter by heterotrophic microorganisms to provide nh4 n for aoa aob 2 aoa aob and nob oxidized nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n as denitrification substrates for dnb 3 autotrophic aoa aob and nob could utilize inorganic carbon produced by heterotrophic microorganisms and 4 smps leached from microbial necromass could serve as an organic carbon source for heterotrophic microorganisms in general taxa in the microbial community preferentially cooperate rather than compete to withstand environmental stress including nutrient poor environments the cooperation between heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria maintained the stability of aquifer microbial communities 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effects of reclaimed water contained three typical β lactams on the recharged aquifer during mar amo and amp were almost removed completely while the removal efficiency of oxa was only 82 effluent doc was no more than 2 5 mg l in the three columns however no3 n removal of oxa column was 23 and 11 higher than that of amo and amp columns respectively nitrogen cycling bacteria were the keynote species under the stress of different β lactams and more dnb was enriched at the deeper layer of oxa column than that of amo and amp columns leading to the higher no3 n removal moreover aoa and dnb were the main arg hosts and args production of oxa column was 10 and 13 higher than that of amo and amp columns in mar the cooperation among various nitrogen cycling bacteria achieved the self rescue to maintain nitrogen transformation but also args spread

and 1 90 mg l respectively table s1 it seems the removal performance of β lactams is largely relied on their physicochemical properties biodegradability and toxicity the presence of antibiotics continuously imposes selective pressure on aquifer microorganisms and results in the proliferation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args during mar an et al 2018 christou et al 2017 reclaimed water is considered a point source of antibiotics and args in freshwater lake sediments czekalski et al 2014 michael et al 2013 reclaimed water irrigation and recharge could result in the enrichment of args in urban park soil as the abundance of args is positively correlated with the concentration of antibiotics wang et al 2014 besides aquifer recharge with stormwater caused the prevalence of args and virulence genes in biofilms sidhu et al 2020 all these studies indicate that the subsurface storage of reclaimed water is an effective strategy but the drawback is that it has a rather large migration range of antibiotics and brings the risk of polluting groundwater and spreading antibiotic resistance one of the key issues of mar is the emerging antibiotics in the recharging regions which induced microbial regulations and even ecological risk theoretically persistence and refractory of the antibiotics could cause the functional microorganisms triggered different resistance mechanisms to achieve self rescue in this study three β lactam antibiotics with significant difference in acute toxicity and biodegradability see table s1 amo amp and oxa were recharged to simulated mar system respectively the temporal and spatial attenuation of the β lactams was investigated and especially their effects on microbial community regulation and args productions were elaborated the self rescue capability of nitrogen cycling bacteria was verified via microbial network collaborations we showed for the first time that the collaboration network of nitrogen cycling bacteria contributed to the stability and resistance of microbial community during mar 2 materials and methods 2 1 mar experimental set up the simulated aquifer recharge experiments were conducted using three plexiglass columns with a height and diameter of 1 5 m and 0 14 m respectively each column was sealed with a flange on the top and the bottom nine sampling ports were installed on both sides with an interval of 0 15 m to allow water and aquifer material collection fig 1 for columns 50 mm of gravel grain size 2 5 mm was added as a supporting layer at the top and bottom all the

2015 michael et al 2013 amoxicillin amo ampicillin amp and oxacillin oxa with concentration of 100 μg l aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china was recharged into three simulated mar system respectively due to the significant differences of oxa on acute toxics and biodegradability with amo and amp we compared oxa with the other two throughout this report the physicochemical properties and toxicity data of three β lactam antibiotics were listed in table s1 2 3 adsorbing capability sorption influences the migration distance and biodegradation efficiency of β lactams thus batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the adsorbing capability of aquifer sediment to β lactams following previous studies ma et al 2021 ying et al 2008 sterilized soil 10 g was mixed with 200 ml of ultra filtered 0 22 μm labfilter usa β lactams solution in 250 ml conical flasks to reach a soil solution ratio of 1 20 w w and negative control was also conducted without aquifer sediment addition then each stock solution of β lactams was spiked to flasks and the final concentrations were 0 05 0 10 0 20 0 50 and 1 00 mg l respectively all flasks were placed on a mechanical shaker at 30 rpm and incubated in the dark at 15 c for an equilibration period of 24 h after equilibration the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber microfilter and the concentrations of β lactams were measured two sorption isotherms linear and freundlich were used to fit the sorption of three β lactams the soil partition coefficient kd l kg and freundlich coefficient kf μg1 nln kg were calculated based on the linear model eq 1 and the freundlich model eq 2 respectively the retardation factors r of the three β lactams were calculated from the experimental kd value according to eq 3 1 q eq k d c eq 2 q eq k

bacteria at the phylum level network analysis was conducted using r software and the results were visualized using gephi software spearman s correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationships among dominant genera and the co occurrence patterns between args and dominant genera the connections were considered strongly correlated according to the following criteria spearman s r 0 6 or r 0 6 and p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of β lactam antibiotics during mar 3 1 1 sorption of β lactams the soil water partition coefficient is an important parameter for evaluating the potential of contaminants to leach into groundwater which is typically described using the linear model and freundlich model the freundlich coefficient kf of oxa fitted by the freundlich isotherm was 5 5 which was 17 3 of amo and 14 0 of amp respectively table 1 kd soil partition coefficient and r retardation factor values of oxa were lower than those of amp and amo indicating that oxa was more easily transported to groundwater compounds with a kd value 500 l kg are considered capable of weak sorption affinity qiu et al 2021 therefore the sorption of the three β lactams in the column was weak and biodegradation was considered the main pathway for β lactams elimination in aquifers simultaneously a negative control was also conducted and found that negligible degradation of three β lactams without aquifer sediment addition 3 1 2 attenuation of organics variations in the three β lactams at the steady stage after 120 d of operation along with the travel distance is shown in fig 2 a most of the recharged amo and amp was eliminated when migrating 30 cm while the attenuation of oxa experienced in the whole column and had a final removal efficiency of 82 in comparison to amo and amp the first order degradation kinetic constant k according to eq s1 of oxa was an order of magnitude lower than that of amo and amp which was attributed to its more stable structure and weak sorption affinity oxa features an isoxazole ring which deteriorated the steric effect and negatively affected enzyme biocatalysis estrada flórez et al 2020 glucose as an easily biodegradable substrate that was depleted within 10 cm fig 2b it probably served as the co substrate to activate non specific enzymes including hydrolases lyases transferases and oxidoreductases zhang et al 2022b there was no significant discrepancy most p 0 05 in doc removal among the three columns under exposure to 100 ug l of antibiotics fig 2b approximately 45 3 of influent doc was degraded in the top 30 cm sediment layer the surface layer of recharge and infiltration was considered the biologically active layer and doc removal was dominant within this area maeng et al 2011b doc gradually stabilized after 60 cm of travel and 1 5 mg l remained in the effluent fig s1 showed the epss content at 15 cm sampling ports were significantly higher than other sampling sites since higher carbon source in influent caused the enrichment of microorganisms and the residual doc was mainly attributed to the soluble microbial products smps leached from the sediment quanrud et al 2003 wang et al 2021a this portion of doc represents an addition carbon pool that could serve as a growth substrate for microorganism haynes et al 2007 variation in β lactams and doc during long term operation is shown in fig 2c high removal performance was observed for amo and amp and the average removal performance was greater than 95 during the whole operation period however the oxa removal was fluctuant compared with amo and amp oxa brought higher toxicity to microorganisms during the first 40 days microorganisms were gradually adapted to the stress of oxa and oxa in the effluents hereafter oxa removal was improved while approximately 15 μg l oxa still remained in the effluents after 40 d the doc of the three columns was stabilized at 1 5 to 2 5 mg l which corresponded to a removal performance of 33 3 60 0 although the attenuation of the three β lactams varied temporally and spatially there was no substantial variation in doc removal 3 1 3 characteristics of microbial community as shown in fig 3 microbial community compositions after long term exposure to three β lactams were compared it showed that microbial community structures were similar among different columns and layers but attained different abundances acinetobacter geobacter and sphingobium were dominant in three columns sphingobium was reported to be candidate β lactams degradation species related genera zhang et al 2022a zhao et al 2020 acinetobacter and geobacter are typical denitrifying bacteria dnb yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022c while their abundances were higher in oxa column compared with amo and amp columns indicating the higher potentials to denitrify on oxa column amo and amp were quickly degraded during the top 30 cm of the column correspondingly geobacter magnetospirillum and zoogloea were dominant at this layer which might be candidate β lactams degradation genera however geobacter and pedosphaera might contribute to oxa degradation geobacter is a widely studied electroactive bacterium that can mineralize refractory organic matter through extracellular electron transfer process wu et al 2023 xiao et al 2021 the scarcity of organic carbon in the aquifer also led to the enrichment of several autotrophic microorganisms including bradyrhizobium sulfuritalea and thiobacillus which can use sulfur compounds and metal as electron donors for denitrification tang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 ca nitrosotalea ca nitrosotenuis and nitrososphaera are typical ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa which have a stronger affinity for nh4 n than traditional ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob xu et al 2021 nitrospira is typical nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for above nitrification microorganisms their abundances of oxa were lower than that of amp and amo overall the majority of microorganisms participate in nitrogen transformation which must lead to the variations of nitrogen 3 1 4 diversity and occurrence of args there was significant difference in β lactams removal during reclaimed water recharging which also caused the discrepancy in args production as shown in fig 4 a total of 311 arg subtypes and 21 arg types were identified from aquifer sediment samples the largest dominant arg type was multidrug 21 4 followed by beta lactamase 16 1 fluoroquinolone 12 2 tetracycline 11 3 and aminoglycoside 11 2 due to the refractory characteristics of oxa the total abundance of args in the oxa columns was 10 and 13 higher than that of amo and amp columns respectively the abundance was highest in the layer at the end oxa 135 in sum the incomplete removal of β lactams induced more considerable risks in arg spreading efflux pump and antibiotics inactivation were the two major resistance mechanisms of aquifer microbes more than 80 of all microbes antibiotic efflux proteins are located in bacterial cell membranes and participated in the excretion of toxic molecules from the host bacteria which mainly results in the enrichment of multidrug resistance genes zhu et al 2017 beta lactamase genes detected in this study were all mediated by antibiotics inactivation which promoted the degradation of β lactams zhang et al 2021 3 2 nitrogen removal and microbial response 3 2 1 transformation of nitrogen variations in nitrogen along the travel distance at the steady stage after 120 days are shown in fig 5 a d influent nh4 n 1 mg l was completely removed within the first 15 cm migration probably via aquifer sorption aerobic ammonium oxidization and microbial assimilation and there was no accumulation of no2 n in the effluent unlike doc removals no3 n removal occurred along the whole column and exposure to different β lactams caused varied no3 n removal efficiencies the removal efficiencies of no3 n for the amo amp and oxa columns were 26 38 and 49 respectively we also observed that no3 n removal occurred constantly was even though easily degradable organic carbon was exhausted smps could be the candidate electron donors for denitrification fig s1 furthermore considerable dissolved inorganic carbon dic released from aquifer sediment which could be another electron donor for autotrophic denitrification fig s2 we deduced that both autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification contributed to no3 n removal consistently the profile of tn within 15 135 cm showed a similar tendency to that of no3 n no3 n and tn concentrations began to decline and gradually stabilized after 40 days of acclimation fig 5e averaged residual concentrations of no3 n and tn of oxa column were 1 5 and 2 1 mg l respectively which were lower than those of amp and amo this suggests that the migration of β lactams was accompanied by nitrogen removal and residual antibiotics improved nitrogen transformation thus nitrogen transforming microorganisms might be carriers of args 3 2 2 response of nitrogen cycling bacteria there was significant discrepancy in nitrogen removal under the stress of three β lactams thus we performed a detailed analysis of nitrogen cycling bacteria and functional genes fig 6 from the layer of 15 cm to 135 cm the total abundance of dominant dnb showed an increasing tendency in oxa column while it was declined in both amp and amo columns correspondingly there was also the highest abundance of denitrification gene enriched in the oxa column fig 6b which led to the higher no3 n removal among various dnb acinetobacter and geobacter were dominant in all sediment samples for oxa column the abundance of acinetobacter reached 6 1 at the layer of 135 cm which was significant higher than that of amp and amo correspondingly the most args were enriched at this layer of oxa column previous study reported the multidrug resistant acinetobacter was isolated thus it might be the main arg host maravić et al 2015 for the three columns nh4 n was completely removed within the top 15 cm while the abundances of nitrification genes amo and hao exhibited the higher abundances at 75 cm and 135 cm than that of 15 cm which suggested that nitrification activity was higher at deeper sediment layers albeit no nh4 n was detected at these depths correspondingly more ca nitrosotenuis and nitrososphaera were enriched microbial ammonation process releases ammonia and the abundance of pseudomonas was gradually increased along the recharge direction fig 6a trung tran et al 2019 therefore ammonium oxidation occurred to the whole recharge height causing the enrichment of aoa and nob along the three columns 3 3 self rescue of nitrogen cycling bacteria 3 3 1 microbial resistance although amo and amp were removed when migrating 30 cm args still spread in whole column and oxa column possessed more args thus whether or not the antibiotic was degraded it caused the spread of arg it is necessary to explain the host of args in order to preliminarily explore the main host of args after β lactams exposure during mar the host identify of args were based on all sediment samples collected in this study co occurrence patterns between microbial communities and args based on network analysis can provide insights into arg hosts zhao et al 2021 the network consisted of 84 nodes 34 genera and 50 arg subtypes and 134 edges and a strong positive correlation was observed spearman s r 0 6 p 0 05 fig 7 eleven genera were considered as potential arg hosts and the number of connections of args was greater than five table s4 among the arg hosts acinetobacter and sphingobium were both correlated with four beta lactamase arg subtypes oxa 211 adc 8 nps 1 and carb 21 we deduced that these two might be the key functional bacteria associated with the degradation of β lactams the genera acinetobacter ca accumulibacter deferrisoma pseudomonas geobacter sphingomonas and sulfuritalea conducted denitrification function were also the hosts of args these dnb could maintain denitrification activity and antibiotic resistance during mar these findings are consistent with the results of previous studies of activated sludge process and solid phase denitrification reactors feng et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 in addition ca nitrosotenuis were the active hosts of args and harbored the most arg subtypes overall we found that nitrogen cycling bacteria were the main hosts of args 3 3 2 microbial cooperation to identify the keystone species and explore potential interactions among taxa in the microbial community network analysis of the dominant genera was carried out based on spearman s correlation coefficients r 0 6 fig 8 highly connected nodes represent keystone species which are the key drivers of many ecological processes and play an intrinsic role in maintaining the stabilization of microbial community banerjee et al 2018 the keystone species in the mar system include ca nitrosotenuis ca accumulibacter sulfuritalea geobacter nitrososphaera and nitrospira these genera involved in nitrogen metabolism and further demonstrated that the importance of nitrogen cycling bacteria in aquifer microbial communities co occurrence network analysis reveals the coordination cooperation and competition relationships among microbial taxa positively correlated connections comprised approximately 60 of all connections demonstrating that cooperation is the predominant interaction mechanism of aquifer microorganisms during mar table s5 and fig 8 typical cooperative interactions included 1 the decomposition of organic matter by heterotrophic microorganisms to provide nh4 n for aoa aob 2 aoa aob and nob oxidized nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n as denitrification substrates for dnb 3 autotrophic aoa aob and nob could utilize inorganic carbon produced by heterotrophic microorganisms and 4 smps leached from microbial necromass could serve as an organic carbon source for heterotrophic microorganisms in general taxa in the microbial community preferentially cooperate rather than compete to withstand environmental stress including nutrient poor environments the cooperation between heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria maintained the stability of aquifer microbial communities 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effects of reclaimed water contained three typical β lactams on the recharged aquifer during mar amo and amp were almost removed completely while the removal efficiency of oxa was only 82 effluent doc was no more than 2 5 mg l in the three columns however no3 n removal of oxa column was 23 and 11 higher than that of amo and amp columns respectively nitrogen cycling bacteria were the keynote species under the stress of different β lactams and more dnb was enriched at the deeper layer of oxa column than that of amo and amp columns leading to the higher no3 n removal moreover aoa and dnb were the main arg hosts and args production of oxa column was 10 and 13 higher than that of amo and amp columns in mar the cooperation among various nitrogen cycling bacteria achieved the self rescue to maintain nitrogen transformation but also args spread

for the west african clade li et al 2010 was applied on wastewater samples collected from week 19 to week 31 of 2022 showing that mpxv dna can be reproducibly detected by qpcr in longitudinal samples collected from several spanish wwtps first detection of mpxv dna was retrieved in a single sample from wwtp13 collected on may 17 week 20 of 2022 using the specific qpcr assay and confirmed by the mpxv generic assay providing the earliest piece of evidence that the virus was circulating in the community of madrid interestingly we consistently detected mpxv dna in samples collected in wwtp18 barcelona since week 23 of 2022 when only 39 cumulative cases were declared in the entire autonomous community of catalonia in line mpxv dna was also detected in week 21 of 2022 on wastewater samples

medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 anticipation of clinical cases has not been observed for mpxv for which the first wastewater detection occurred at the same time that mpx cases were declared fig 3 this could be due to several factors including differences in shedding levels and kinetics proportion of asymptomatic cases diagnosis of the disease and fast identification of cases environmental factors affecting virus stability a much larger scale of transmission of sars cov 2 in the community and low performance of the method to concentrate mpxv this latter was further rule out as the performance characteristics of the methodology was carried out for mpxv fig 2 showing similar mean recoveries compared with sars cov 2 and its surrogates pérez cataluña et al 2021 moreover it is important to highlight that wastewater positive samples have been found in areas with very low reported disease prevalence for instance in castilla la mancha a region located at the middle south of spain mpxv was detected in sewage with only 42 clinical cases being reported indicating that probably a higher number of people may be affected as previously discussed by other authors stigma and discrimination may be limiting the awareness or willingness of at risk people to have their symptoms evaluated in these situations wbe may be even more useful because the anonymous pooled samples can

15104,besides nasopharyngeal swabs monkeypox virus mpxv dna has been detected in a variety of samples such as saliva semen urine and fecal samples using the environmental surveillance network previously developed in spain for the routine wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 vatar covid 19 we have analyzed the presence of mpxv dna in wastewater from different areas of spain samples n 312 from 24 different wastewater treatment plants were obtained between may 9 week 19 of 2022 and august 4 week 31 of 2022 following concentration of viral particles by a validated aluminum adsorption precipitation method a qpcr procedure allowed us to detect mpxv dna in 56 wastewater samples collected from may 16 to august 4 2022 with values ranging between 2 2 103 to 8 7 104 genome copies gc l this study shows that mpxv dna can be reproducibly detected by qpcr in longitudinal samples collected from different spanish wastewater treatment plants according to data from the national epidemiological surveillance network renave in spain a total of 6 119 cases have been confirmed as of august 19 2022 however and based on the wastewater data the reported clinical cases seem to be underestimated and asymptomatic infections may be more frequent than expected graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords monkeypox wastewater epidemiology wbe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in early may 2022 a multi country outbreak of monkeypox virus mpxv started in non endemic regions and on 23 july who declared a public health emergency of international concern who 2022 in europe a total of 13 911 cases of mpx have been reported up to 19 august 2022 with spain accounting for 6 119 cases the second highest number of monkeypox mpx cases worldwide being present in most regions of the country spanish ministry of health 2022 symptoms developed include the appearance of rash fever fatigue muscle pain vomiting diarrhea chills sore throat or headache and the hospitalization rate is around 8 13 european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2022 thornhill et al 2022 sadly two deaths linked to this outbreak have occurred in spain due to complications associated with encephalitis aguilera alonso et al 2022 it is assumed that transmission occurs after close contact with skin lesions of an infected person as well as through contact with respiratory droplets and fomites and that infection is symptomatic in all patients mccollum and damon 2014 however antibodies have been found in exposed asymptomatic individuals which can be linked to subclinical infections wilson et al 2014 and positive mpxv pcr results from anal samples in asymptomatic men who have sex with men msm have also been documented baetselier et al 2022 ferré et al 2022 the virus is also excreted in fluids and its detection in saliva semen urine and feces has been reported peiró mestres et al 2022 hernaez et al 2023 this implies that routine wastewater surveillance can be applied as a tool for early detection of the disease expansion as very recently reported following a model based theoretical evaluation chen and bibby 2022 according with this model wastewater based epidemiology wbe can detect on average 7 mpx cases out of 100 000 people currently various studies detected mpxv dna in wastewater worldwide de jonge et al 2022 la rosa et al 2023 wolfe et al 2022 highlighting again wastewater analysis as a non invasive tool for monitoring the status and trend of an emerging infection the aim of the present study was to trace the community circulation of the mpxv from potentially symptomatic asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals using the previous established spanish national sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance network vatar covid 19 2 material and methods 2 1 sample concentration and dna extraction grab sewage samples were weekly collected from 24 spanish wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig 1 c between may 9 week 19 of 2022 and august 4 week 31 of 2022 and kept at 4 c until analysis concentration of viral fraction was performed by a previously validated method for sars cov 2 using an aluminum based adsorption precipitation procedure pérez cataluña et al 2021 in order to evaluate the analytical performance of this concentration method 200 ml of grab sewage samples n 4 that previously tested negative for mpxv were inoculated with 107 pfu of inactivated mpxv mpxv suspension was obtained by infecting a clinical mpxv specimen obtained from a patient pustule in bsc 1 cells mpxv stock was inactivated in the bsl 3 laboratory molecular biology center severo ochoa cbm madrid by limited cross linking with a combination of psoralen 4 9 aminomethyl trioxsalen sigma and long wave uv light as previously described for other poxviruses tsung et al 1996 briefly virus stock was incubated with 2 µg ml psoralen for 10 min at room temperature followed by 10 min irradiation with long wave ultra violet light 365 nm virus inactivation was further confirmed by two consecutive plaque assays in bsc 1 cells to discard virus induced effects nucleic acids extraction 100 µl of the concentrated samples 300 µl was performed by the maxwell rsc instrument promega using the maxwell rsc pure food gmo and authentication kit promega and the maxwell rsc viral total nucleic acid program 2 2 mpxv real time pcr assays the mpxv west africa g2r wa assay li et al 2010 was applied to quantify mpxv dna using the qpcr premix ex taq kit takara bio inc additionally a subset of samples table s1 was tested for mpxv dna using the mpxv generic g2r g assay li et al 2010 both assays targeted the tnf receptor gene undiluted and ten fold diluted dna 2 5 µl was tested in duplicate positive control consisted in the nucleic acid material extracted from a cell culture infected with a clinical mpxv specimen obtained from a patient pustule for each qpcr serial dilutions of standard curves were run in quintuplicates and the numbers of estimated genome copies were calculated table s2 each run included negative controls nuclease free water and negative extraction controls depending on the laboratory reactions were carried out in the quantstudio 3 and quantstudio 5 real time pcr systems thermofisher sci for each specific target cq values 40 were converted into genome copies gc per liter using the corresponding standard curve and volumes tested occurrence of inhibition was estimated by comparing average viral titers obtained from duplicate wells tested on undiluted dna with duplicate wells tested on 10 fold diluted dna inhibition was ascertained when difference in average viral titers was higher than 0 5 log10 and if that occurred viral titers were inferred from the 10 fold dna dilution 2 3 clinical epidemiological data the number of declared active cases per week for the different autonomous communities was obtained from the spanish ministry of health spanish ministry of health 2022 3 results 3 1 estimated levels of monkeypox virus dna in wastewater samples here we report the first detection of mpxv dna in wastewater samples from different regions of spain 56 out of 312 samples showed positive results for mpxv dna corresponding to samples collected from week 20 to week 31 of 2022 cycle threshold values ranged between 39 98 and 34 5 corresponding to values from 2 2 103 to 8 7 104 estimated gc per liter fig 1a the aluminum based adsorption precipitation method was tested by spiking negative wastewater samples with inactivated mpxv suspension on average mpxv was recovered at ranges of 31 5 15 9 and 45 5 25 7 in the undiluted and ten fold diluted samples respectively thus validating the results fig 2 first detection of mpxv dna in wastewater samples occurred in wwtp13 from the city of madrid in week 20 of 2022 figs 1a and 3 with positive detection using two different assays table s1 on that week madrid reported the first suspected cases of mpx which represented the first cases of mpx in spain accounting for one of the largest outbreaks reported outside africa martínez et al 2022 later on several cases were reported in madrid before the outbreak declaration on 17 may most of them attending the same sauna in the city of madrid or with travel history to maspalomas gay pride festival that took place on 5 15 may in gran canaria in week 21 of 2022 mpxv dna was detected in the nearest wwtps of madrid city wwtp12 and wwtp13 and in wwtp20 of gran canaria canary islands fig 1 table s1 interestingly we consistently detected mpxv dna in samples collected from week 23 of 2022 in wwtp12 and wwtp13 from madrid when only 275 cumulative cases were declared in the entire region martínez et al 2022 our data also showed percentages of wwtps with mpxv dna detection increased progressively up to 15 by week 24 of 2022 and 40 by week 26 of 2022 figs 1a and 3 in barcelona the second largest spanish city first detection occurred in week 24 of 2022 in wwtp18 with the
