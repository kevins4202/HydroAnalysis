4655,groundwater with low levels of arsenic as in deep aquifers has been overexploited for decades in many regions such as south asian and american countries resulting in the compaction of clayey aquitards and the release of pore water with as into deeper aquifers however the release mechanism of arsenic during clayey aquitards compaction is poorly understood an indoor compaction experiment using muddy sediments was conducted to identify the as releasing mechanisms during clayey aquitards compaction the chemical characteristics and as species in pore water and sediment samples collected at different stages during the compaction experiment were analyzed initially the reductive dissolution of iron oxides was a key process controlling as release during compaction with increased pressure as desorption from fe hydr oxides became more important than the reductive dissolution as the main driver for as release at the end of the compaction the release of as was weak and the dominant process was desorption of as from clay or carbonate minerals our estimate result in the jianghan plain suggested that as concentration release from aquitard compaction by overexploited into groundwater would be 9 33 118 09 μg l keywords arsenic clayey sediments pore water compaction 1 introduction groundwater is a critical resource that provides almost half of all drinking water in the world shamsudduha et al 2011 margat and gun 2013 however concerns exist regarding threats to groundwater quality caused by naturally high arsenic as concentrations which seriously affect the health of 100 million people worldwide ravenscroft et al 2009 groundwater contamination poses a considerable and growing human health threat particularly in south and southeast asia and north and south america where at least 1 4 of the world s population relies heavily on groundwater harvey et al 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 fendorf et al 2010a guo et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2015 in general deep aquifers have low as concentrations and are viewed as alternatives to shallow aquifers high in as erban et al 2013 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2020 therefore groundwater exploitation of deep aquifers continues to rise in numerous countries onodera et al 2008 hosono et al 2011 guo et al 2015 however studies have revealed that groundwater overextraction can lead to the release of naturally occurring as into deep aquifers erban et al 2013 khan et al 2016 when deep aquifers are stressed due to overdevelopment high vertical hydraulic gradients can cause a larger volume of water to be drawn from less permeable clayey aquitards this induces the release of water with high as concentrations resulting in increased as concentrations in deep aquifers smith et al 2018 however as behavior during the clayey aquitard compaction process caused by groundwater overexploitation have been poorly documented clayey aquitards which are associated with aquifers are a critical part of the groundwater system li et al 2017a studies have suggested that quaternary aquifers are generally protected by overlying clayey aquitards hendry and wassenaar 2011 hiscock et al 2011 however an increasing number of studies have suggested a close hydraulic relationship between aquitards and adjacent aquifers wang et al 2013 li et al 2017b du et al 2018a in contrast to aquifers clayey aquitards are generally rich in dissolved organic carbon 1 3 orders of magnitude higher higher levels than sandy aquifers microorganisms heavy metals and other contaminants guerrero et al 2005 polizzotto et al 2008 du et al 2018b mozumder et al 2020 the original poisonous chemicals such as arsenic iodine and ammonium can enter the adjacent aquifers through the compaction of clayey aquitards jiao et al 2010 erban et al 2013 kuang et al 2016 xue et al 2019 which might pose a contamination risk to usable groundwater research shows that groundwater pumping will lead to the organic carbon in the clay layer indirectly expelled into the underlying aquifer which will cause arsenic contamination of this aquifer mihajlov et al 2020 although many field studies have confirmed that clayey aquitard compaction can lead to the release of contaminants e g as the detailed mechanisms of as release have not been identified through laboratory experiments in this study we conducted an indoor compaction experiment using a typical clayey aquitard muddy sediments to identify the as releasing mechanisms during aquitard compaction furthermore we aimed to understand the geochemical processes responsible for as mobilization from clayey aquitards under groundwater overextraction 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediments sample collection column samples were collected from a 3 1 m2 low lying paddy field with a pond nearby located in east of xiantao jianghan plain jhp central china e 113 43 44 6 n 30 16 26 3 the paddy field was formed after the degradation of the lake the black gray muddy sediments below the surface exhibited high water content and poor permeability muddy sediment column samples were collected from 1 m underground using a sediment corer kc hand operated sediment corer 50820 denmark in december 2017 the length and the diameter of the sediment corer were 30 cm and 12 5 cm respectively the topsoil was removed with a spade and then four parallel sedimentary columns were collected and immediately wrapped in polypropylene bags these bags were later vacuumed to minimize atmospheric exposure before the compaction experiment all samples were collected less than one month and transported to a laboratory using a low temperature box with ice bags and were stored at 4 c until further analysis atmosphere before the compaction experiment 2 2 experimental device and method the muddy sediments were compacted using a low pressure pressing and airtight device fig 1 the experimental device can be used to simulate the compaction of muddy sediment and collect pore water of sediment samples studies chapman et al 2002 lopes and ribeiro 2005 have revealed that sediment pressurization under low pressure 5 mpa more efficiently extracted pore water than centrifugation and the chemical composition and redox status of pore water changed only slightly the oxidized part surrounding the muddy sediment column sample m 3 41 kg was scraped off for ensuring the primitiveness of samples before the sample was placed into the device the air in the device was expelled with argon before the piston was installed then the sediment column also continuously supplied with argon when it was placed into the device after the device was assembled the column sample was placed in a closed state for 12 h before the compaction experiment this experiment consisted of three groups in group a to meet the requirements of pore water testing volume and sampling time a rate of 0 1 mpa 24 h was pressured on sediment sample by adjusting the air pressure valve the pressure ranged from 0 to 0 9 mpa a parallel experiment was performed although the pressure rate of the compaction experiment differed from the actual sedimentation rate caused by overextraction of groundwater the variation trend and reaction process of sediments and pore water in the compaction process of the clayey aquitard could be reflected to some extent by the laboratory experiments approximately 15 ml of pore water was collected every 24 h for 10 20 min and preserved for testing because the samples were collected in anaerobic bottles redox conditions were considered stable during the short sampling period according to the result of as concentration variation in the pore water released in group a we observed two sudden changes in as concentration therefore groups b and c were set up according to the pressure at the sudden change points a new muddy sediment column sample was used for the experiment on group b and group c respectively the pressurization rate of both group b and group c was 0 1 mpa 24 h but the pressure range was 0 to 0 2 mpa and 0 to 0 7 mpa respectively the collection of pore water and sediment samples in group b and group c were the same as group a table 1 2 3 pore water sample analysis conductivity ph and eh were measured during the sampling period using a hach hq40d multimeter ferrous ion and ammonium were measured using a hach 2800 portable spectrophotometer and hach reagent kits 103769 cn ferrous ion reagent and 2458200 cn ammonium reagent samples were filtered immediately using a 0 45 μm membrane filters and divided into five aliquots for analysis of anion cation total dissolved as as iii and dissolved organic carbon doc samples were acidified to ph 2 using ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis samples were acidified with concentrated hcl for analysis of total dissolved as and as iii for doc analysis samples were preserved in 10 ml brown glass bottles and acidified with 150 µl of concentrated h3po4 for all pore water samples trace elements were measured through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp aes nexion 350d perkinelmer with detection limits of 0 01 μg l total dissolved as and as iii were determined using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs hg afs 930 jitian china with detection limits of 0 01 μg l doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer elementar vario toc cube with detection limits of 0 01 mg l the aforementioned measurements were all completed at the china university of geosciences 2 4 sediment sample analysis sediment samples were dried milled and sifted for chemical analysis before and after the experiment the total as content in sediments was determined using hg afs after dissolving the sample in chloroazotic acid as follows 5 ml of 1 1 chloroazotic acid was added to the 0 1 g of dry sample and heated at 100 c for 1 5 h then 2 5 ml of concentrated hcl was added every 0 5 h the solution was diluted to 25 ml and left to stand overnight sequential extraction was conducted to determine as phases in sediments by using a widely applied extraction procedure tessier et al 1979 keon et al 2001 a 0 2 g subsample of sediment was added to a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube along with 40 ml of the first extractant 1 mol l mgcl2 reagent concentrations and sediment to extractant ratios of 1 100 0 4 g to 40 ml were selected to ensure sufficient supply of each extract consequently the following forms of as were extracted from sediments ionically bound as 1 mol l mgcl2 strongly adsorbed arsenic 1 mol l nah2po4 as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals 1 mol l hcl as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides 0 2 mol l acid ammonium oxalate as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides 0 2 mol l acid ammonium oxalate and 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter 0 02 mol l hno3 30 h2o2 these extraction steps are referred to hereafter as mg phos hcl ox ox vc and hno3 h2o2 respectively in every procedure extractants were decanted from the centrifuge tubes the extractants were filtered through 0 45 μm polycarbonate filters and the filtrate was then acidified using concentrated hcl for as analysis through hg afs amorphous fe oxides were determined using icp aes thermo electric com iris intrepid ii xsp after dissolving 1 25 g of the dry sample in 25 ml of 0 2 m acid ammonium oxalate ph 3 2 5 geochemical inverse modeling to assess as mobilization in the clayey sediments during compaction geochemical inverse modeling was conducted using the public code phreeqc 3 charlton and parkhurst 2011 with the wateq4f database it was assumed that the mobilization of arsenic in pore water during compaction was related to dissolution or precipitation of mineral phases the hydrochemical results of pore water in different compaction stages were used in geochemical inverse modeling to interpret the behavior of as in the clayey sediments during compaction the reactive minerals in the model were selected according to the results of sediment chemical extraction the pore water concentrations of ca2 na mg2 fe2 hco3 so4 2 and cl as well as ph were used in the modeling an uncertainty limit of 0 025 was selected for all the models and the potential mineral phases in the modeling were defined as precipitation or dissolution by using a conceptual model of general trends according to hydrochemical data and the saturation indices calculated using phreeqc 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of pore water during the compaction experiment after compaction the length of the column in group a was 13 2 cm and the total pore water release volume was 786 ml after 228 h the cumulative amount of as released from muddy sediments gradually increased during the compaction and the total released amount was 19 017 μg analytical results of water samples collected at different compaction stages are summarized in table 2 both ph and eh first exhibited a decreasing trend and then an increasing trend during the compaction whereas electrical conductivity exhibited an opposite trend over time table 2 the ph varied from 7 08 to 8 09 and the eh values were negative at all the time points indicating that the experimental system was in a weak to moderately alkaline reductive environment during the compaction process during the early stage of compaction the concentration of no3 was fairly high 7 30 mg l however the concentration decreased rapidly as the compaction time increased and was only 0 32 mg l when the experiment ended moreover the concentrations of so4 2 were low and gradually decreased during compaction high fe and mn concentrations were frequently detected in pore water samples table 2 and all of them greatly exceeded the world health organization who guideline limit 0 3 and 0 5 mg l respectively in addition the redox indicators such as fe ii and nh4 n were also detected in all the samples and the concentrations of fe ii and nh4 n were ranged from 1 31 to 3 19 and 0 75 to 2 75 mg l respectively total as concentration in pore water samples ranged from 11 1 to 36 4 μg l table 2 with an average value of 22 4 μg l exceeding the limit of who guidelines for drinking water quality 10 µg l the results verified that the muddy sediment compaction process releases as as iii concentrations varied in the range of 3 3 22 0 μg l and accounted for 25 5 60 3 of the total as total as correlated well with as iii r2 0 88 fig 2 and both total as and as iii had a similar variation in concentration over time the concentration of total as and as iii increased gradually at 0 0 2 mpa of pressure and then decreased gradually at 0 2 0 7 mpa and increased slightly at 0 7 mpa it finally continued to decrease gradually at 0 7 0 9 mpa of pressure as iii exhibited a positive correlation with fe ii r2 0 46 fig 3 and total as was positively associated with as iii fe and doc fig 3 3 2 change of as in solid phases during the compaction experiment on the basis of the variation trend of as concentration in the pore water of group a we divided the whole compaction process into stages 1 pressure from 0 to 0 2 mpa 2 pressure from 0 2 to 0 7 mpa and 3 pressure from 0 7 to 0 9 mpa table 3 showed that the contents of arsenic forms in sediments from three groups were basically consistent before compaction indicating that the parallelism of the sediment samples was good in general strongly adsorbed as and as coprecipitated with fe hydr oxides accounted for the majority of the active arsenic forms before compaction with a combined total of 70 compared with 0 mpa of pressure the sequential extraction results indicated that the content of ionically bound as as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides in the muddy sediments increased 45 2 μg kg 354 3 μg kg and 69 4 μg kg respectively when the pressure was increased to 0 2 mpa whereas strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter decreased 240 2 μg kg 551 2 μg kg and 197 3 μg kg respectively table 3 when the pressure was increased to 0 7 mpa ionically bound as as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter in the muddy sediments increased 38 4 μg kg 236 7 μg kg and 90 6 μg kg whereas strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides decreased 426 8 μg kg 286 8 μg kg and 81 8 μg kg respectively table 3 when the pressure was increased to 0 9 mpa ionically bound as strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter increased 35 0 μg kg 64 6 μg kg 151 7 μg kg and 102 5 μg kg respectively whereas as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides decreased 284 1 μg kg and 335 1 μg kg respectively table 3 results indicated that after stage 1 compaction as content of ionically bound as as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides increased 26 25 32 76 and 9 96 whereas strongly adsorbed arsenic as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter decreased 6 53 67 57 and 30 56 compared with stage 1 as content of as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter increased 32 92 and 46 13 whereas strongly adsorbed arsenic as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides decreased 4 71 10 47 and 21 34 in stage 2 compared with stage 2 as content of strongly adsorbed arsenic and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides increased 12 99 and 32 78 whereas as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides decreased 44 79 and 2 83 in stage 3 in addition amorphous fe oxide content decreased 7 14 and 15 30 in stage 1 and stage 2 but remained constant in stage 3 3 3 geochemical inverse modeling geochemical inverse modeling was performed to further interpret the behavior of as and fe in the clayey sediments during compaction see supporting information for model details as chemical extraction results indicated that poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and crystallized fe hydr oxides are closely related to the fate of as during compaction thus goethite and fe oh 3 a were selected for the inverse model because of the high ca2 and hco3 concentrations detected in pore water samples calcite was included as a potential mineral phase in the model cation exchange reactions were also considered in the model the reaction and solubility products of the potential mineral phases selected in the model are presented in table 4 to constrain the inverse model minerals were set to dissolve or precipitate to achieve equilibrium the results of phase mole transfer of minerals are shown in table 4 inverse modeling results indicated that calcite mgx2 and nax generally precipitated in the subsurface whereas cax2 dissolved during compaction goethite was dissolved at 0 0 2 0 2 0 5 and 0 7 0 9 mpa whereas it was precipitated at 0 5 0 7 mpa fe oh 3 a precipitated at 0 0 2 0 2 0 5 and 0 7 0 9 mpa whereas it dissolved at 0 5 0 7 mpa the modeling results of fe minerals compared well with the sequential extraction results of as phases in clayey sediments during compaction 4 discussion 4 1 varieties of as in pore water during compaction during the compaction experiment the variations of as in pore water and sediments were different in the three stages fig 4 clearly showed that compaction process can lead to significant changes of arsenic species in pore water which indicated compaction effect the migration and transformation of arsenic in clayey sediments the variation in eh and ph during compaction led to the conversion of as species from as v to as iii in stage 1 as iii to as v in stage 2 and no change from as v in stage 3 which can cause the release of as from solid phase to aqueous phase fig 4 in addition the decrease of eh in stage 1 and stage 2 could also cause changes to as and fe mineral phases during compaction xiao et al 2018 as iii exhibited a positive correlation with fe ii indicating that the reductive dissolution of iron oxides or hydroxides occurred which produces more soluble and reactive low valence irons fe2 and the as adsorbed on their surface were released into pore water guo et al 2011 bugueno et al 2014 moreover positive correlations of total as with as iii fe and doc further indicated that reductive dissolution of iron oxides or hydroxides occurred through organic matter during compaction leading to as release from the muddy sediments 4 2 mechanism of as release in clayey sediments during compaction the compaction process according to comprehensive analysis that incorporated hydrogeochemical parameter data and sediment chemical extraction results is summarized in fig 6 stage 1 marked the beginning of the compaction process at the beginning of stage 1 as v was immobilized by sorption onto the surface of fe oxides such as feohaso4 under high ph 8 09 and weak oxidizing conditions schaefer et al 2017 duan et al 2017 resulting in as v becoming the dominant as in pore water as the compaction experiment proceeded eh values gradually decreased from 15 7 to 89 3 mv indicating the redox environment of the system changed from weak oxidizing to reducing with compaction as such the dominant species of as could change from as v to as iii at the end of stage 1 leading to the increasing of total as and as iii concentrations in pore water in addition the favorable association between as iii and fe ii in pore water indicated that the weaker association between as iii and fe iii minerals caused the release of as from a solid to aqueous phase guo 2014 moreover the decrease of eh and ph led to the occurrence of as and fe mineral phase transformations dixit and hering 2003 chemical extraction analysis revealed that the amount of amorphous fe oxides and as coprecipitated with poorly crystalline fe oxides decreased in stage 1 further indicating that as coexisting with the amorphous fe iii minerals was a major factor in as release from the muddy sediments in stage 1 deng et al 2018 the modeling results were also consistent with the observation that as separated from the amorphous fe iii hydr oxides during stage 1 suggesting that the reductive dissolution of iron oxides was a key process controlling the release of as yan et al 2000 bauer et al 2008 furthermore the decrease in strongly adsorbed as was next to as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides suggesting desorption of as from fe oxides also occurred consistent with the results of water chemistry table 2 in summary reductive dissolution of fe oxides and desorption of as from fe oxides both occurred in stage 1 leading to the release of arsenic in clayey sediments the reducing dissolution reaction of iron oxide was the main reaction in the whole stage stage 2 refers to the middle of the compaction process with compaction ongoing pressure from 0 2 to 0 7 mpa the eh decreased slightly and the ph increased increasing ph was beneficial for as v adsorption onto the surface of fe minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 resulting in a decrease of aquatic as eh values ranging from 91 1 to 101 9 v indicated the redox environment of the system was in a strong reducing condition the decreasing of amorphous fe oxides content in sediments indicated that reductive dissolution occurred at stage 2 however the dominant as species were as iii at 0 2 0 5 mpa and as v at 0 5 0 7 mpa which implies that as mobilization might be different in the two periods the relationship of as and as iii concentration with fe ii fe ratios could infer the geochemical process of as mobilization pi et al 2015 fig 5 pore water samples in trend 1 typically exhibited high as iii concentrations and fe ii fe ratios amorphous fe iii hydr oxides dissolution was confirmed by the inverse modeling results indicating that reductive dissolution of the amorphous fe hydr oxides triggered a considerable release of as into pore water at 0 2 0 5 mpa schaefer et al 2016 in addition higher as concentration observed in samples at 0 2 0 5 mpa might be due to as v reductive desorption accompanying the fe iii reduction however compared with stage 1 doc concentrations in pore water reduced slightly from 6 98 to 6 22 mg l at 0 2 to 0 5 mpa indicating that the biological function of this period was weaker than that at stage 1 and leading to slowly reductive dissolution and gradually decreasing aquatic as concentrations xie et al 2012 pi et al 2018 chemical extraction results revealed that the reduction content of as with fe hydr oxides coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and with crystalline fe oxides at 0 2 to 0 7 mpa 368 6 μg kg was less than that in stage 1 481 8 μg kg further confirming that reductive dissolution was weaker than stage 1 although crystallized fe hydr oxides were dissolving according to modeling results low as iii concentration and fe ii fe ratios of pore water samples were observed in trend 2 the more pronounced decrease of strongly adsorbed as in stage 2 suggests that the desorption of as from fe minerals in the muddy sediments is the dominant process of as mobilization at 0 5 0 7 mpa in addition a small decrease of as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals showed a part of the arsenic came from the desorption of clay or carbonate minerals these suggested that reductive dissolution of as with fe hydr oxides phases was the main driver for as release at 0 2 0 5 mpa whereas desorption of as from fe hydr oxides was the dominant process at 0 5 0 7 mpa postma et al 2010 mai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 stage 3 was the final stage of compaction when the pressure increased from 0 7 to 0 9 mpa both the eh and ph increased measured ph of pore water samples were close to 8 resulting in negatively charged as v adsorbed on iron oxides as concentrations in pore water were much lower in stage 3 table 2 with as v the dominant species in addition the ratio of fe ii fe was low the average was 0 36 and as iii only accounted for 28 of the total as indicating that reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides might not be the main factor causing as release from the clayey sediments in stage 3 islam et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010b moreover the amorphous fe oxides content remained basically unchanged compared with stage 2 from 11 4 mg kg to 11 5 mg kg further proving the reductive dissolution was weakly in 0 7 0 9 mpa chemical extraction results indicated that as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals decreased substantially compared with the end of stage 2 demonstrating that as mobilization might be influenced by carbonate minerals desorption under compaction guo et al 2016 furthermore the increase in strongly adsorbed as suggested that adsorption of as onto fe minerals and organic matter was a critical process controlling as immobilization in stage 3 goldberg 2002 leading to decreased as concentration in pore water therefore as was desorbed from the surface of clay minerals or carbonate minerals and part of it was adsorbed to iron minerals or organic matter simultaneously in stage 3 4 3 estimation of accumulated as release from the aquitard into the underlying aquifer under overextraction of groundwater groundwater overextraction has been reported in numerous regions of northeast china such as the north china plain songnen plain and liaohe plain changming et al 2001 chen et al 2003 hu et al 2004 owing to abundant surface water resources in south china such as in the jhp the utilization of groundwater resources is mainly concentrated in shallow aquifers at present however as pollution is serious in shallow aquifers of the jhp whereas as concentrations are significantly lower in deep aquifers deng et al 2014 gan et al 2014 du et al 2018a therefore deep groundwater is gradually becoming water supply source for local residents this may result in aquitard compaction by overexploitation of deep groundwater and as release from the aquitard into deep aquifers in the jhp in this study field data and laboratory compaction experiments were used to conduct a theoretical assessment in a region in the jhp and calculate the effect of aquitard compaction and as release on the underlying aquifer fig 7 shows the shallow aquitard is composed of clay and silt with a thickness of 10 30 m the underlying aquifer sand is for local water supply with a thickness of 50 80 m in jianghan plain below the aquifer there is a continuous deep aquitard clay and silt with a thickness of about 10 20 m and an underlying deeper confined aquifer gravel and sand that we will main discuss in our article the contribution of the deep aquitard to arsenic accumulation of the underlyingdeeper confined aquifer should be calculated first without compaction by groundwater over extraction under the base scenario as will be released from the clayey aquitard by advection and diffusion mihajlov et al 2020 in the case of advection the darcy velocity of aquitard pore water into the underlying aquifer is 0 002 m2 per year du et al 2018c since aquitard pore water contains average 25 μg l as xiao et al 2020 the average flux would bring approximately 50 μg m2 as per year assuming the time of groundwater overexploitation is 10 years 20 years and 50 years respectively a total of 500 μg 1000 μg and 2500 μg as per square meter would have been advected into the underlying aquifer fick s first law can be used to evaluate the impact of diffusive as flux in the geologic past mihajlov et al 2020 using a diffusivity value of 1 6 10 4m2 year westerhoff et al 2005 a clayey aquitard porosity of 0 5 zhang et al 2017 and a as gradient of 1500 μg m4 assumed the arsenic concentration in the bottom of the aquitard the thickness of 1 m and the top of underlying aquifer is 25 μg l and 10 μg l respectively the as diffusive flux from the aquitard to the underlying aquifer is 1 2 μg m2 per year the deep aquitard in the study area is dated on 2000 4000 years based on the ages of shallow confined aquifer 2000 years and deep confined aquifer 4000 years du et al 2018a 2018b 2018c if the diffusion gradient was maintained at most 4000 years by the continuous release of as in the deep aquitard the total flux of as into the upper deep aquifer based on fickian diffusion would be 4800 μg m2 the total of as will be released from the clayey aquitard in 1 m2 by advection and diffusion to the underlying aquifer was 5300 μg 5800 μg and 7300 μg in 10 years 20 years and 50 years respectively besides doc could be supplied from the clay to the underlying aquifer by advection or diffusion which would lead as release from the underlying aquifer sediments mihajlov et al 2020 since aquitard pore water contains average 12 mg l of doc liu et al 2020 the average flux would bring approximately 0 024 g m2 of carbon per year which is equivalent to 2 10 3 mol of c m2 year using a doc gradient of 0 016 mm m assumed the doc concentration in a half of the thickness of the 20 m clay layer and the top of underlying aquifer was 12 mg l and 10 mg l cug 2016 respectively the doc diffusive flux was 0 72 10 4 mol of c m2 year the deep aquitard in the study area is dated on 2000 4000 years based on the ages of shallow confined aquifer 2000 years and deep confined aquifer 4000 years du et al 2018a indicating the total flux of doc into the upper deep aquifer based on fickian diffusion would be 0 28 mol of c m2 year comparing with the the input of doc 530 10 3 mol of c m2 year by advection and 5 mol of c m2 year by diffusion to the aquifer in the paper of mihajlov the calculation results showed that the input of doc by advection or diffusion had little impact on the release of arsenic to the aquifer in addition the lack of data on iron content and reduction rate in deep aquifer sediments made it difficult to accurately calculate arsenic concentrations so this part of as concentration was not considered in the article even though the surface which in turn gives rise to compaction of deep aquitard the pressure is about 0 8 mpa but our experiment mainly considers the compaction of deep aquitard caused by over extraction of groundwater therefore the overlying layer pressure is not considered in the calculation when the pressure is 0 mpa in our compaction experiment we considered it corresponds to no aquitard compaction caused by groundwater overexploitation using the principle of equal scaling the amount of as released from the aquitard m the arsenic release amount obtained in the experiment the mass ratio of the sample column and the aquitard pumping time by using compression ratio data the amount of as released in the compaction experiment in this study and the stratigraphic information of the aquitard in the jhp from related studies deng et al 2014 du et al 2017 shen et al 2019 the amounts of as released from the aquitard under different subsidence rates and pumping times are estimated as m 20 m y 1 m 2 π r 2 h t μ g where the estimated area is set as 1 m2 the thickness of the aquitard and the underlying aquifer are considered 20 m based on its physical characteristics y is the amount of as released under a certain amount of pressure based on compression ratio data and amounts of as released from the compaction experiment y 42 45x 0 2825 μg where is the compression amount and r and h refer to the radius and height of the experimental sediment column respectively t is the pumping time in general average annual subsidence rates of 0 3 0 3 0 5 and 0 5 0 8 m year are considered to denote low medium and high degrees of subsidence respectively wang and di 2019 in addition studies have found that the subsidence rate of a city in the jhp over 2013 2015 was 0 05 0 78 m year therefore several sets of typical subsidence rates and pumping times were used to estimate the amount of as released from the aquitard table 5 assuming the aquifer porosity of 0 43 schaefer et al 2016 du et al 2018b 10 m thick square meter column of the aquifer the aquitard compaction by groundwater over extraction would result in as concentration of 9 33 118 09 μg l in groundwater according to the estimated results the concentration of as range from 1 23 μg l to 1 69 μg l released from the aquitard by advection and diffusion does not have a considerable effect on the as concentrations in the underlying aquifer however in case of aquitard compaction the concentration of as released from the aquitard the resulting as concentration in groundwater would be 9 33 118 09 μg l has a significant effect on the underlying aquifer therefore groundwater overextraction should be gradually ceased or groundwater resources should be only moderately exploited to reduce as accumulation in the underlying aquifer 5 conclusions long term overextraction of groundwater may cause clayey aquitard compression resulting in as release from the aquitard into the underlying aquifer our laboratory experiment results revealed that clayey sediments of aquitards can lead to as accumulation in released pore water under compaction compaction demonstrated a considerable effect on the mobilization of as in the clayey aquitard sediments whether in the contents or the forms of as in pore water and sediments the compaction of the aquitard resulted in as release from clayey sediments into pore water after complex biogeochemical reactions in redox conditions at the beginning of the compaction 0 0

4655,groundwater with low levels of arsenic as in deep aquifers has been overexploited for decades in many regions such as south asian and american countries resulting in the compaction of clayey aquitards and the release of pore water with as into deeper aquifers however the release mechanism of arsenic during clayey aquitards compaction is poorly understood an indoor compaction experiment using muddy sediments was conducted to identify the as releasing mechanisms during clayey aquitards compaction the chemical characteristics and as species in pore water and sediment samples collected at different stages during the compaction experiment were analyzed initially the reductive dissolution of iron oxides was a key process controlling as release during compaction with increased pressure as desorption from fe hydr oxides became more important than the reductive dissolution as the main driver for as release at the end of the compaction the release of as was weak and the dominant process was desorption of as from clay or carbonate minerals our estimate result in the jianghan plain suggested that as concentration release from aquitard compaction by overexploited into groundwater would be 9 33 118 09 μg l keywords arsenic clayey sediments pore water compaction 1 introduction groundwater is a critical resource that provides almost half of all drinking water in the world shamsudduha et al 2011 margat and gun 2013 however concerns exist regarding threats to groundwater quality caused by naturally high arsenic as concentrations which seriously affect the health of 100 million people worldwide ravenscroft et al 2009 groundwater contamination poses a considerable and growing human health threat particularly in south and southeast asia and north and south america where at least 1 4 of the world s population relies heavily on groundwater harvey et al 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 fendorf et al 2010a guo et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2015 in general deep aquifers have low as concentrations and are viewed as alternatives to shallow aquifers high in as erban et al 2013 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2020 therefore groundwater exploitation of deep aquifers continues to rise in numerous countries onodera et al 2008 hosono et al 2011 guo et al 2015 however studies have revealed that groundwater overextraction can lead to the release of naturally occurring as into deep aquifers erban et al 2013 khan et al 2016 when deep aquifers are stressed due to overdevelopment high vertical hydraulic gradients can cause a larger volume of water to be drawn from less permeable clayey aquitards this induces the release of water with high as concentrations resulting in increased as concentrations in deep aquifers smith et al 2018 however as behavior during the clayey aquitard compaction process caused by groundwater overexploitation have been poorly documented clayey aquitards which are associated with aquifers are a critical part of the groundwater system li et al 2017a studies have suggested that quaternary aquifers are generally protected by overlying clayey aquitards hendry and wassenaar 2011 hiscock et al 2011 however an increasing number of studies have suggested a close hydraulic relationship between aquitards and adjacent aquifers wang et al 2013 li et al 2017b du et al 2018a in contrast to aquifers clayey aquitards are generally rich in dissolved organic carbon 1 3 orders of magnitude higher higher levels than sandy aquifers microorganisms heavy metals and other contaminants guerrero et al 2005 polizzotto et al 2008 du et al 2018b mozumder et al 2020 the original poisonous chemicals such as arsenic iodine and ammonium can enter the adjacent aquifers through the compaction of clayey aquitards jiao et al 2010 erban et al 2013 kuang et al 2016 xue et al 2019 which might pose a contamination risk to usable groundwater research shows that groundwater pumping will lead to the organic carbon in the clay layer indirectly expelled into the underlying aquifer which will cause arsenic contamination of this aquifer mihajlov et al 2020 although many field studies have confirmed that clayey aquitard compaction can lead to the release of contaminants e g as the detailed mechanisms of as release have not been identified through laboratory experiments in this study we conducted an indoor compaction experiment using a typical clayey aquitard muddy sediments to identify the as releasing mechanisms during aquitard compaction furthermore we aimed to understand the geochemical processes responsible for as mobilization from clayey aquitards under groundwater overextraction 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediments sample collection column samples were collected from a 3 1 m2 low lying paddy field with a pond nearby located in east of xiantao jianghan plain jhp central china e 113 43 44 6 n 30 16 26 3 the paddy field was formed after the degradation of the lake the black gray muddy sediments below the surface exhibited high water content and poor permeability muddy sediment column samples were collected from 1 m underground using a sediment corer kc hand operated sediment corer 50820 denmark in december 2017 the length and the diameter of the sediment corer were 30 cm and 12 5 cm respectively the topsoil was removed with a spade and then four parallel sedimentary columns were collected and immediately wrapped in polypropylene bags these bags were later vacuumed to minimize atmospheric exposure before the compaction experiment all samples were collected less than one month and transported to a laboratory using a low temperature box with ice bags and were stored at 4 c until further analysis atmosphere before the compaction experiment 2 2 experimental device and method the muddy sediments were compacted using a low pressure pressing and airtight device fig 1 the experimental device can be used to simulate the compaction of muddy sediment and collect pore water of sediment samples studies chapman et al 2002 lopes and ribeiro 2005 have revealed that sediment pressurization under low pressure 5 mpa more efficiently extracted pore water than centrifugation and the chemical composition and redox status of pore water changed only slightly the oxidized part surrounding the muddy sediment column sample m 3 41 kg was scraped off for ensuring the primitiveness of samples before the sample was placed into the device the air in the device was expelled with argon before the piston was installed then the sediment column also continuously supplied with argon when it was placed into the device after the device was assembled the column sample was placed in a closed state for 12 h before the compaction experiment this experiment consisted of three groups in group a to meet the requirements of pore water testing volume and sampling time a rate of 0 1 mpa 24 h was pressured on sediment sample by adjusting the air pressure valve the pressure ranged from 0 to 0 9 mpa a parallel experiment was performed although the pressure rate of the compaction experiment differed from the actual sedimentation rate caused by overextraction of groundwater the variation trend and reaction process of sediments and pore water in the compaction process of the clayey aquitard could be reflected to some extent by the laboratory experiments approximately 15 ml of pore water was collected every 24 h for 10 20 min and preserved for testing because the samples were collected in anaerobic bottles redox conditions were considered stable during the short sampling period according to the result of as concentration variation in the pore water released in group a we observed two sudden changes in as concentration therefore groups b and c were set up according to the pressure at the sudden change points a new muddy sediment column sample was used for the experiment on group b and group c respectively the pressurization rate of both group b and group c was 0 1 mpa 24 h but the pressure range was 0 to 0 2 mpa and 0 to 0 7 mpa respectively the collection of pore water and sediment samples in group b and group c were the same as group a table 1 2 3 pore water sample analysis conductivity ph and eh were measured during the sampling period using a hach hq40d multimeter ferrous ion and ammonium were measured using a hach 2800 portable spectrophotometer and hach reagent kits 103769 cn ferrous ion reagent and 2458200 cn ammonium reagent samples were filtered immediately using a 0 45 μm membrane filters and divided into five aliquots for analysis of anion cation total dissolved as as iii and dissolved organic carbon doc samples were acidified to ph 2 using ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis samples were acidified with concentrated hcl for analysis of total dissolved as and as iii for doc analysis samples were preserved in 10 ml brown glass bottles and acidified with 150 µl of concentrated h3po4 for all pore water samples trace elements were measured through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp aes nexion 350d perkinelmer with detection limits of 0 01 μg l total dissolved as and as iii were determined using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs hg afs 930 jitian china with detection limits of 0 01 μg l doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer elementar vario toc cube with detection limits of 0 01 mg l the aforementioned measurements were all completed at the china university of geosciences 2 4 sediment sample analysis sediment samples were dried milled and sifted for chemical analysis before and after the experiment the total as content in sediments was determined using hg afs after dissolving the sample in chloroazotic acid as follows 5 ml of 1 1 chloroazotic acid was added to the 0 1 g of dry sample and heated at 100 c for 1 5 h then 2 5 ml of concentrated hcl was added every 0 5 h the solution was diluted to 25 ml and left to stand overnight sequential extraction was conducted to determine as phases in sediments by using a widely applied extraction procedure tessier et al 1979 keon et al 2001 a 0 2 g subsample of sediment was added to a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube along with 40 ml of the first extractant 1 mol l mgcl2 reagent concentrations and sediment to extractant ratios of 1 100 0 4 g to 40 ml were selected to ensure sufficient supply of each extract consequently the following forms of as were extracted from sediments ionically bound as 1 mol l mgcl2 strongly adsorbed arsenic 1 mol l nah2po4 as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals 1 mol l hcl as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides 0 2 mol l acid ammonium oxalate as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides 0 2 mol l acid ammonium oxalate and 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter 0 02 mol l hno3 30 h2o2 these extraction steps are referred to hereafter as mg phos hcl ox ox vc and hno3 h2o2 respectively in every procedure extractants were decanted from the centrifuge tubes the extractants were filtered through 0 45 μm polycarbonate filters and the filtrate was then acidified using concentrated hcl for as analysis through hg afs amorphous fe oxides were determined using icp aes thermo electric com iris intrepid ii xsp after dissolving 1 25 g of the dry sample in 25 ml of 0 2 m acid ammonium oxalate ph 3 2 5 geochemical inverse modeling to assess as mobilization in the clayey sediments during compaction geochemical inverse modeling was conducted using the public code phreeqc 3 charlton and parkhurst 2011 with the wateq4f database it was assumed that the mobilization of arsenic in pore water during compaction was related to dissolution or precipitation of mineral phases the hydrochemical results of pore water in different compaction stages were used in geochemical inverse modeling to interpret the behavior of as in the clayey sediments during compaction the reactive minerals in the model were selected according to the results of sediment chemical extraction the pore water concentrations of ca2 na mg2 fe2 hco3 so4 2 and cl as well as ph were used in the modeling an uncertainty limit of 0 025 was selected for all the models and the potential mineral phases in the modeling were defined as precipitation or dissolution by using a conceptual model of general trends according to hydrochemical data and the saturation indices calculated using phreeqc 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of pore water during the compaction experiment after compaction the length of the column in group a was 13 2 cm and the total pore water release volume was 786 ml after 228 h the cumulative amount of as released from muddy sediments gradually increased during the compaction and the total released amount was 19 017 μg analytical results of water samples collected at different compaction stages are summarized in table 2 both ph and eh first exhibited a decreasing trend and then an increasing trend during the compaction whereas electrical conductivity exhibited an opposite trend over time table 2 the ph varied from 7 08 to 8 09 and the eh values were negative at all the time points indicating that the experimental system was in a weak to moderately alkaline reductive environment during the compaction process during the early stage of compaction the concentration of no3 was fairly high 7 30 mg l however the concentration decreased rapidly as the compaction time increased and was only 0 32 mg l when the experiment ended moreover the concentrations of so4 2 were low and gradually decreased during compaction high fe and mn concentrations were frequently detected in pore water samples table 2 and all of them greatly exceeded the world health organization who guideline limit 0 3 and 0 5 mg l respectively in addition the redox indicators such as fe ii and nh4 n were also detected in all the samples and the concentrations of fe ii and nh4 n were ranged from 1 31 to 3 19 and 0 75 to 2 75 mg l respectively total as concentration in pore water samples ranged from 11 1 to 36 4 μg l table 2 with an average value of 22 4 μg l exceeding the limit of who guidelines for drinking water quality 10 µg l the results verified that the muddy sediment compaction process releases as as iii concentrations varied in the range of 3 3 22 0 μg l and accounted for 25 5 60 3 of the total as total as correlated well with as iii r2 0 88 fig 2 and both total as and as iii had a similar variation in concentration over time the concentration of total as and as iii increased gradually at 0 0 2 mpa of pressure and then decreased gradually at 0 2 0 7 mpa and increased slightly at 0 7 mpa it finally continued to decrease gradually at 0 7 0 9 mpa of pressure as iii exhibited a positive correlation with fe ii r2 0 46 fig 3 and total as was positively associated with as iii fe and doc fig 3 3 2 change of as in solid phases during the compaction experiment on the basis of the variation trend of as concentration in the pore water of group a we divided the whole compaction process into stages 1 pressure from 0 to 0 2 mpa 2 pressure from 0 2 to 0 7 mpa and 3 pressure from 0 7 to 0 9 mpa table 3 showed that the contents of arsenic forms in sediments from three groups were basically consistent before compaction indicating that the parallelism of the sediment samples was good in general strongly adsorbed as and as coprecipitated with fe hydr oxides accounted for the majority of the active arsenic forms before compaction with a combined total of 70 compared with 0 mpa of pressure the sequential extraction results indicated that the content of ionically bound as as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides in the muddy sediments increased 45 2 μg kg 354 3 μg kg and 69 4 μg kg respectively when the pressure was increased to 0 2 mpa whereas strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter decreased 240 2 μg kg 551 2 μg kg and 197 3 μg kg respectively table 3 when the pressure was increased to 0 7 mpa ionically bound as as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter in the muddy sediments increased 38 4 μg kg 236 7 μg kg and 90 6 μg kg whereas strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides decreased 426 8 μg kg 286 8 μg kg and 81 8 μg kg respectively table 3 when the pressure was increased to 0 9 mpa ionically bound as strongly adsorbed as as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter increased 35 0 μg kg 64 6 μg kg 151 7 μg kg and 102 5 μg kg respectively whereas as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides decreased 284 1 μg kg and 335 1 μg kg respectively table 3 results indicated that after stage 1 compaction as content of ionically bound as as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides increased 26 25 32 76 and 9 96 whereas strongly adsorbed arsenic as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter decreased 6 53 67 57 and 30 56 compared with stage 1 as content of as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and as coprecipitated with sulfide and organic matter increased 32 92 and 46 13 whereas strongly adsorbed arsenic as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides decreased 4 71 10 47 and 21 34 in stage 2 compared with stage 2 as content of strongly adsorbed arsenic and as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides and amorphous sulfides increased 12 99 and 32 78 whereas as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals and as coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides decreased 44 79 and 2 83 in stage 3 in addition amorphous fe oxide content decreased 7 14 and 15 30 in stage 1 and stage 2 but remained constant in stage 3 3 3 geochemical inverse modeling geochemical inverse modeling was performed to further interpret the behavior of as and fe in the clayey sediments during compaction see supporting information for model details as chemical extraction results indicated that poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and crystallized fe hydr oxides are closely related to the fate of as during compaction thus goethite and fe oh 3 a were selected for the inverse model because of the high ca2 and hco3 concentrations detected in pore water samples calcite was included as a potential mineral phase in the model cation exchange reactions were also considered in the model the reaction and solubility products of the potential mineral phases selected in the model are presented in table 4 to constrain the inverse model minerals were set to dissolve or precipitate to achieve equilibrium the results of phase mole transfer of minerals are shown in table 4 inverse modeling results indicated that calcite mgx2 and nax generally precipitated in the subsurface whereas cax2 dissolved during compaction goethite was dissolved at 0 0 2 0 2 0 5 and 0 7 0 9 mpa whereas it was precipitated at 0 5 0 7 mpa fe oh 3 a precipitated at 0 0 2 0 2 0 5 and 0 7 0 9 mpa whereas it dissolved at 0 5 0 7 mpa the modeling results of fe minerals compared well with the sequential extraction results of as phases in clayey sediments during compaction 4 discussion 4 1 varieties of as in pore water during compaction during the compaction experiment the variations of as in pore water and sediments were different in the three stages fig 4 clearly showed that compaction process can lead to significant changes of arsenic species in pore water which indicated compaction effect the migration and transformation of arsenic in clayey sediments the variation in eh and ph during compaction led to the conversion of as species from as v to as iii in stage 1 as iii to as v in stage 2 and no change from as v in stage 3 which can cause the release of as from solid phase to aqueous phase fig 4 in addition the decrease of eh in stage 1 and stage 2 could also cause changes to as and fe mineral phases during compaction xiao et al 2018 as iii exhibited a positive correlation with fe ii indicating that the reductive dissolution of iron oxides or hydroxides occurred which produces more soluble and reactive low valence irons fe2 and the as adsorbed on their surface were released into pore water guo et al 2011 bugueno et al 2014 moreover positive correlations of total as with as iii fe and doc further indicated that reductive dissolution of iron oxides or hydroxides occurred through organic matter during compaction leading to as release from the muddy sediments 4 2 mechanism of as release in clayey sediments during compaction the compaction process according to comprehensive analysis that incorporated hydrogeochemical parameter data and sediment chemical extraction results is summarized in fig 6 stage 1 marked the beginning of the compaction process at the beginning of stage 1 as v was immobilized by sorption onto the surface of fe oxides such as feohaso4 under high ph 8 09 and weak oxidizing conditions schaefer et al 2017 duan et al 2017 resulting in as v becoming the dominant as in pore water as the compaction experiment proceeded eh values gradually decreased from 15 7 to 89 3 mv indicating the redox environment of the system changed from weak oxidizing to reducing with compaction as such the dominant species of as could change from as v to as iii at the end of stage 1 leading to the increasing of total as and as iii concentrations in pore water in addition the favorable association between as iii and fe ii in pore water indicated that the weaker association between as iii and fe iii minerals caused the release of as from a solid to aqueous phase guo 2014 moreover the decrease of eh and ph led to the occurrence of as and fe mineral phase transformations dixit and hering 2003 chemical extraction analysis revealed that the amount of amorphous fe oxides and as coprecipitated with poorly crystalline fe oxides decreased in stage 1 further indicating that as coexisting with the amorphous fe iii minerals was a major factor in as release from the muddy sediments in stage 1 deng et al 2018 the modeling results were also consistent with the observation that as separated from the amorphous fe iii hydr oxides during stage 1 suggesting that the reductive dissolution of iron oxides was a key process controlling the release of as yan et al 2000 bauer et al 2008 furthermore the decrease in strongly adsorbed as was next to as coprecipitated with crystalline fe oxides suggesting desorption of as from fe oxides also occurred consistent with the results of water chemistry table 2 in summary reductive dissolution of fe oxides and desorption of as from fe oxides both occurred in stage 1 leading to the release of arsenic in clayey sediments the reducing dissolution reaction of iron oxide was the main reaction in the whole stage stage 2 refers to the middle of the compaction process with compaction ongoing pressure from 0 2 to 0 7 mpa the eh decreased slightly and the ph increased increasing ph was beneficial for as v adsorption onto the surface of fe minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 resulting in a decrease of aquatic as eh values ranging from 91 1 to 101 9 v indicated the redox environment of the system was in a strong reducing condition the decreasing of amorphous fe oxides content in sediments indicated that reductive dissolution occurred at stage 2 however the dominant as species were as iii at 0 2 0 5 mpa and as v at 0 5 0 7 mpa which implies that as mobilization might be different in the two periods the relationship of as and as iii concentration with fe ii fe ratios could infer the geochemical process of as mobilization pi et al 2015 fig 5 pore water samples in trend 1 typically exhibited high as iii concentrations and fe ii fe ratios amorphous fe iii hydr oxides dissolution was confirmed by the inverse modeling results indicating that reductive dissolution of the amorphous fe hydr oxides triggered a considerable release of as into pore water at 0 2 0 5 mpa schaefer et al 2016 in addition higher as concentration observed in samples at 0 2 0 5 mpa might be due to as v reductive desorption accompanying the fe iii reduction however compared with stage 1 doc concentrations in pore water reduced slightly from 6 98 to 6 22 mg l at 0 2 to 0 5 mpa indicating that the biological function of this period was weaker than that at stage 1 and leading to slowly reductive dissolution and gradually decreasing aquatic as concentrations xie et al 2012 pi et al 2018 chemical extraction results revealed that the reduction content of as with fe hydr oxides coprecipitated in poorly crystalline fe hydr oxides and with crystalline fe oxides at 0 2 to 0 7 mpa 368 6 μg kg was less than that in stage 1 481 8 μg kg further confirming that reductive dissolution was weaker than stage 1 although crystallized fe hydr oxides were dissolving according to modeling results low as iii concentration and fe ii fe ratios of pore water samples were observed in trend 2 the more pronounced decrease of strongly adsorbed as in stage 2 suggests that the desorption of as from fe minerals in the muddy sediments is the dominant process of as mobilization at 0 5 0 7 mpa in addition a small decrease of as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals showed a part of the arsenic came from the desorption of clay or carbonate minerals these suggested that reductive dissolution of as with fe hydr oxides phases was the main driver for as release at 0 2 0 5 mpa whereas desorption of as from fe hydr oxides was the dominant process at 0 5 0 7 mpa postma et al 2010 mai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 stage 3 was the final stage of compaction when the pressure increased from 0 7 to 0 9 mpa both the eh and ph increased measured ph of pore water samples were close to 8 resulting in negatively charged as v adsorbed on iron oxides as concentrations in pore water were much lower in stage 3 table 2 with as v the dominant species in addition the ratio of fe ii fe was low the average was 0 36 and as iii only accounted for 28 of the total as indicating that reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides might not be the main factor causing as release from the clayey sediments in stage 3 islam et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010b moreover the amorphous fe oxides content remained basically unchanged compared with stage 2 from 11 4 mg kg to 11 5 mg kg further proving the reductive dissolution was weakly in 0 7 0 9 mpa chemical extraction results indicated that as coprecipitated with carbonate minerals decreased substantially compared with the end of stage 2 demonstrating that as mobilization might be influenced by carbonate minerals desorption under compaction guo et al 2016 furthermore the increase in strongly adsorbed as suggested that adsorption of as onto fe minerals and organic matter was a critical process controlling as immobilization in stage 3 goldberg 2002 leading to decreased as concentration in pore water therefore as was desorbed from the surface of clay minerals or carbonate minerals and part of it was adsorbed to iron minerals or organic matter simultaneously in stage 3 4 3 estimation of accumulated as release from the aquitard into the underlying aquifer under overextraction of groundwater groundwater overextraction has been reported in numerous regions of northeast china such as the north china plain songnen plain and liaohe plain changming et al 2001 chen et al 2003 hu et al 2004 owing to abundant surface water resources in south china such as in the jhp the utilization of groundwater resources is mainly concentrated in shallow aquifers at present however as pollution is serious in shallow aquifers of the jhp whereas as concentrations are significantly lower in deep aquifers deng et al 2014 gan et al 2014 du et al 2018a therefore deep groundwater is gradually becoming water supply source for local residents this may result in aquitard compaction by overexploitation of deep groundwater and as release from the aquitard into deep aquifers in the jhp in this study field data and laboratory compaction experiments were used to conduct a theoretical assessment in a region in the jhp and calculate the effect of aquitard compaction and as release on the underlying aquifer fig 7 shows the shallow aquitard is composed of clay and silt with a thickness of 10 30 m the underlying aquifer sand is for local water supply with a thickness of 50 80 m in jianghan plain below the aquifer there is a continuous deep aquitard clay and silt with a thickness of about 10 20 m and an underlying deeper confined aquifer gravel and sand that we will main discuss in our article the contribution of the deep aquitard to arsenic accumulation of the underlyingdeeper confined aquifer should be calculated first without compaction by groundwater over extraction under the base scenario as will be released from the clayey aquitard by advection and diffusion mihajlov et al 2020 in the case of advection the darcy velocity of aquitard pore water into the underlying aquifer is 0 002 m2 per year du et al 2018c since aquitard pore water contains average 25 μg l as xiao et al 2020 the average flux would bring approximately 50 μg m2 as per year assuming the time of groundwater overexploitation is 10 years 20 years and 50 years respectively a total of 500 μg 1000 μg and 2500 μg as per square meter would have been advected into the underlying aquifer fick s first law can be used to evaluate the impact of diffusive as flux in the geologic past mihajlov et al 2020 using a diffusivity value of 1 6 10 4m2 year westerhoff et al 2005 a clayey aquitard porosity of 0 5 zhang et al 2017 and a as gradient of 1500 μg m4 assumed the arsenic concentration in the bottom of the aquitard the thickness of 1 m and the top of underlying aquifer is 25 μg l and 10 μg l respectively the as diffusive flux from the aquitard to the underlying aquifer is 1 2 μg m2 per year the deep aquitard in the study area is dated on 2000 4000 years based on the ages of shallow confined aquifer 2000 years and deep confined aquifer 4000 years du et al 2018a 2018b 2018c if the diffusion gradient was maintained at most 4000 years by the continuous release of as in the deep aquitard the total flux of as into the upper deep aquifer based on fickian diffusion would be 4800 μg m2 the total of as will be released from the clayey aquitard in 1 m2 by advection and diffusion to the underlying aquifer was 5300 μg 5800 μg and 7300 μg in 10 years 20 years and 50 years respectively besides doc could be supplied from the clay to the underlying aquifer by advection or diffusion which would lead as release from the underlying aquifer sediments mihajlov et al 2020 since aquitard pore water contains average 12 mg l of doc liu et al 2020 the average flux would bring approximately 0 024 g m2 of carbon per year which is equivalent to 2 10 3 mol of c m2 year using a doc gradient of 0 016 mm m assumed the doc concentration in a half of the thickness of the 20 m clay layer and the top of underlying aquifer was 12 mg l and 10 mg l cug 2016 respectively the doc diffusive flux was 0 72 10 4 mol of c m2 year the deep aquitard in the study area is dated on 2000 4000 years based on the ages of shallow confined aquifer 2000 years and deep confined aquifer 4000 years du et al 2018a indicating the total flux of doc into the upper deep aquifer based on fickian diffusion would be 0 28 mol of c m2 year comparing with the the input of doc 530 10 3 mol of c m2 year by advection and 5 mol of c m2 year by diffusion to the aquifer in the paper of mihajlov the calculation results showed that the input of doc by advection or diffusion had little impact on the release of arsenic to the aquifer in addition the lack of data on iron content and reduction rate in deep aquifer sediments made it difficult to accurately calculate arsenic concentrations so this part of as concentration was not considered in the article even though the surface which in turn gives rise to compaction of deep aquitard the pressure is about 0 8 mpa but our experiment mainly considers the compaction of deep aquitard caused by over extraction of groundwater therefore the overlying layer pressure is not considered in the calculation when the pressure is 0 mpa in our compaction experiment we considered it corresponds to no aquitard compaction caused by groundwater overexploitation using the principle of equal scaling the amount of as released from the aquitard m the arsenic release amount obtained in the experiment the mass ratio of the sample column and the aquitard pumping time by using compression ratio data the amount of as released in the compaction experiment in this study and the stratigraphic information of the aquitard in the jhp from related studies deng et al 2014 du et al 2017 shen et al 2019 the amounts of as released from the aquitard under different subsidence rates and pumping times are estimated as m 20 m y 1 m 2 π r 2 h t μ g where the estimated area is set as 1 m2 the thickness of the aquitard and the underlying aquifer are considered 20 m based on its physical characteristics y is the amount of as released under a certain amount of pressure based on compression ratio data and amounts of as released from the compaction experiment y 42 45x 0 2825 μg where is the compression amount and r and h refer to the radius and height of the experimental sediment column respectively t is the pumping time in general average annual subsidence rates of 0 3 0 3 0 5 and 0 5 0 8 m year are considered to denote low medium and high degrees of subsidence respectively wang and di 2019 in addition studies have found that the subsidence rate of a city in the jhp over 2013 2015 was 0 05 0 78 m year therefore several sets of typical subsidence rates and pumping times were used to estimate the amount of as released from the aquitard table 5 assuming the aquifer porosity of 0 43 schaefer et al 2016 du et al 2018b 10 m thick square meter column of the aquifer the aquitard compaction by groundwater over extraction would result in as concentration of 9 33 118 09 μg l in groundwater according to the estimated results the concentration of as range from 1 23 μg l to 1 69 μg l released from the aquitard by advection and diffusion does not have a considerable effect on the as concentrations in the underlying aquifer however in case of aquitard compaction the concentration of as released from the aquitard the resulting as concentration in groundwater would be 9 33 118 09 μg l has a significant effect on the underlying aquifer therefore groundwater overextraction should be gradually ceased or groundwater resources should be only moderately exploited to reduce as accumulation in the underlying aquifer 5 conclusions long term overextraction of groundwater may cause clayey aquitard compression resulting in as release from the aquitard into the underlying aquifer our laboratory experiment results revealed that clayey sediments of aquitards can lead to as accumulation in released pore water under compaction compaction demonstrated a considerable effect on the mobilization of as in the clayey aquitard sediments whether in the contents or the forms of as in pore water and sediments the compaction of the aquitard resulted in as release from clayey sediments into pore water after complex biogeochemical reactions in redox conditions at the beginning of the compaction 0 0 2 mpa the reductive dissolution of iron oxides was a key factor controlling as release from the clayey sediments with increased pressure 0 2 0 7 mpa desorption of as from fe hydr oxides replaced reductive dissolution as the main driver for as release at the end of the compaction 0 7 0 9 mpa as release was weak and the dominant process was as desorption from clay or carbonate minerals the estimation results of the concentration of as released from the aquitard into the underlying aquifer under overextraction of groundwater highlights the importance of this issue groundwater overexploitation should be gradually stopped or groundwater should only be moderately exploited to reduce as accumulation in the underlying aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors

4656,determining transient fluid saturations in a multi phase system is important for understanding the system s flow characteristics and performing effective subsurface remediation this paper investigates the models to quantify the fluid saturations of three phases of napl water gas in 2d porous media systems using a noninvasive light transmission technique four light intensity saturation models lisms to quantify fluid saturations from light intensities with only two parameters are proposed four lisms can be divided into two classes one based on assumption a of individual drainage and the other based on assumption b of combined drainage lisms are verified by two experiments conducted in napl invading into water air and water biogenic gas conditions respectively results show that the model which based on assumption a and drainage of water first is the best type and show the strongest linear correlation between calculated results and measured data r2 of 0 974 for air condition and r2 of 0 996 for biogenic gas condition this study developed the innovative lisms and applied them to three phases of napl water gas systems which provides a methodology to acquire effective three fluid saturations in a continuous quantitative and real time way keywords multi phase fluid saturation napl water gas light transmission porous media 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napls such as gasoline range petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents are frequently detected groundwater contaminants at hazardous waste sites hou and lu 2018 kechavarzi et al 2005 2000 napls typically have low solubilities napls released to the subsurface can partition into the groundwater representing a potential long term contamination source there has been a aconsiderable interest in the problem of multi phase flow related to napls contamination in recent years chevalier 2003 darnault et al 1998 detwiler et al 2001 fure et al 2006 rimmer et al 1998 carroll et al 2015 zhong et al

the lowest cost alternative ltv was first developed by hoa 1981 to quantify saturation in a sand filled chamber based on light refraction theory an independent empirical calibration curve between light intensity and saturation was required in his method tidwell and glass 1994 developed a mathematical model to calculate saturation from light intensity measurements by assuming an individual drainage conceptual model wherein each pore was either full or empty of water this method correlated the number of pores filled with water to water saturation and the number of pores across the thickness of the models k which was a fitting empirical parameter and calculated for each experiment a major contribution to this method was achieved by niemet and selker 2001 five physically based models for predicting liquid saturation from light transmission in 2d laboratory systems containing translucent porous media were developed and tested niemet and selker 2001 five physical relationships model a e relating light transmission to liquid saturation were developed based upon various simplifying assumptions concerning pore geometry wettability and drainage characteristics the parameter k was mathematically calculated pixel by pixel from light intensity of dry and water saturated models o carroll et al 2007 applied one of five models model a of niemet and selker 2001 to quantify napl saturation in n w system fluid saturations were estimated by correlating normalized light intensity to the napl saturation to enhance its visual observation the napl was dyed with 0 035 by weight sudan iii in the n w system bob et al 2008 presented a modified method based on ltv for dnapl saturation measurements which was essentially only based on model c developed by niemet and selker 2001 the method was verified by three types of napl water experiments including undyed and dyed pce perchloroethylene and there was a good agreement between the results obtained and ltv methods also bob et al 2008 proposed that their method can be expanded to measure fluid contents in three phase system deng et al 2017 applied the method proposed by bob et al 2008 to provide high resolution saturation data while the electrical resistivity tomography ert method was applied to capture the change of resistivity in a laboratory sandbox wang et al 2008 used the method developed from models a and c of niemet and selker 2001 a binary method and a novel multiphase wavelength method to quantify napl mass and mass reduction in a 2d laboratory flow chamber for the n w system results showed that model c of niemet and selker 2001 with the assumption of wetting media of uniform pore size and the multiple wavelength model with no interface structure assumption were able to accurately quantify pce mass reduction during surfactant flushing zhang et al 2014 proposed simplified models to predict fluid saturation in water gas system and napl water system with only one parameter which are easier to apply comparing with the models developed by nimet and selker 2001 and that by bob et al 2008 both with 6 parameters zhao et al 2015 developed an improved light transmission method in which transmission images were captured by a 10 000 000 pixel digital camera to study lnapl migration and distribution pattern all the previous studies involved two phase system water gas or napl water the primary objective of this work is to develop light intensity saturation models lisms to determine fluid saturation in napl water gas n w g systems using the light transmission technique the method is an extension of earlier methods by tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2001 bob et al 2008 and zhang et al 2014 to our best knowledge it is the first attempt to quantify liquid saturation of n w g system in laboratory experiments two relationships relating light transmission to fluid saturation with different assumptions regarding drainage were developed for n w g system these relationships were applied and verified in two experiments conducted in a 2d coarse sand system with three phases of n w g 2 light intensity saturation models at the pore scale light propagates through solid liquid and gas phase constituents each with a separate absorption coefficient for a specific wavelength of light the measured light intensity i transmitted through a medium of thickness dj can be described by combining beer s law and fresnel s law niemet and selker 2001 1 i c i in τ i k exp α j d j where iin is the intensity of the incident light τi k is light transmittance across the interface between phases i and k as defined by fresnel s law αj is the light absorption coefficient of medium j e g sand particles and dyed napl absorb light at wavelengths used in our experiment visible light range but the absorption by air and water is negligible bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 c is a geometric correction factor that may be omitted for collimated light or if the source and media are approximately equidistant from the detector bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 wang et al 2008 many common aquifer materials such as quartz and carbonates are water wetting selker et al 1999 a reasonable assumption is that a water film coats the particles and an effective pore space exists between the liquid films but not between the sand grains as shown in fig 1 denoted as models c and d by niemet and selker 2001 additionally because of napl films existing between air and water light intensity losses between solid and water films is much more than between water air films and napl films so films of napl existing between air and water are not considered in the model simplification fig 1 consider a porous medium that is idealized as uniform cubic particles of width ds there can be two types of drainage assumptions a a specified phase such as water napl or gas fills a single pore entirely when it is displaced by another material b the effective pores drain in a combined incremental manner and each pore contains the same fraction of the specified phases fig 1 the fraction of water volume held within the films is constant and equal to the residual saturation sres this assumption was based on the condition that a porous media was initially saturated with water was drained by gas then napl however it could lead to inaccuracies if a porous medium was initially saturated with water drained by napl then by air the absolute water saturation sabs w is related to the effective saturation sw as follows 2 s abs w s w 1 s res s res models to predict fluid saturation in water gas system and napl water system are detailedly expressed in the paper by zhang et al 2014 as for the napl water gas three phase system because of ig io iw the intensity of

with the assumption of wetting media of uniform pore size with individual drainage model n w g a assume that the interstitial pores drain individually randomly and completely a pore is either full of napl or water assumption a in fig 1 neglecting absorption by the water phase eq 1 can be used to describe the intensity of light transmitted through the media i as follows 3 i c i in τ s w 2 k τ w o 2

to calculate the saturation of a specific phase in a napl water gas system when napl is infiltrating into a water gas system the displacement of water or gas during napl infiltration is presumed one

the absolute saturation of the specified phase subscript α indicates napl water or gas a is the area of each pixel t is the thickness of each pixel θ is the porosity of the porous medium and n1 and n2 are the number of pixels along the x and y axes respectively 2 3 light intensity saturation models expressed with parameters c1 and c2 eqs 6 and 8 can be combined to obtain 15 i g i w τ w g 2 k where k is the number of particles or pores across the medium thickness relating to the property of the porous medium and the degree of compaction τw g in eq 11 is the transmittance of the water gas interface which is only associated with the properties of liquids wang et al 2008 once the chamber is installed k and τw g are considered constant during the experiment then the ig iw ratio is considered to be constant and is denoted by c1 zhang et al 2014 c1 is characteristic of the experimental system and not just of the sand theoretically c1 for water gas system was obtained using images of a water saturated and a drained air water pack a reference value of c1 0 200 0 015 for 20 30 mesh sand was obtained by the corresponding data given by niemet and selker 2001 model c and model d by niemet and selker 2001 renamed model w g a and w g b here respectively are transferred into eqs 16 and 17 with the parameter c1 model w g a model c by niemet and selker 2001 using c1 is 16 s g ln i i

bob et al 2008 which is related to the transmission factor for the water oil interface τw o and the total number of pores across the thickness of the chamber k k can be calculated from the dry id and water saturated iw light intensities as proposed by niemet and selker 2001 for dyed pce the transmission factor for the dyed pce water interface is determined by mass balance calibration however if the wet packing method is used it is difficult to practically obtain id in the laboratory the parameter k which was a key parameter in previous models niemet and selker 2001 is in fact difficult to obtain therefore the io iw ratio is denoted as c2 for the napl water system zhang et al 2014 from eq 18 the parameter c2 correlates to the property of liquids τw o αdo and the porous medium k l c2 could be obtained in the laboratory by measuring io and iw c2 is constant for a specific pixel in a chamber and can show spatial variation due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium models n w g a

fluids in a chamber the light transmission system included a coupled charge device ccd camera ap2e apogee instruments auburn ca associated with its software maxim dl ottawa on a flow chamber and a light bank lighting of the chamber was only provided by the light bank mounted 12 5 cm from the chamber to isolate heat transfer between the light bank and chamber the light bank consisted of 6 fluorescent tubes panasonic yz18rr6500k and was mounted behind a diffuser to homogenize the incident light the ccd camera was installed 1 8 m from the chamber in a wooden enclosure the wooden enclosure ensured that only light passing through the chamber from the light bank was captured by the ccd camera a 543 10 nm band pass filter was placed on the camera lens pc nikkor 1 2 8f 35 mm nippon kogaku japan to maximize the camera s sensitivity to migrating fluids the utilization of a ccd camera in light transmission systems provides a nearly instantaneous high density array of spatial measurements over a very large dynamic range whereas long count times and or small point wise measurements are typical of the other methods the systems employed here are capable of obtaining a 1536 1024 image array 1 572 864 individual points with each sub 1 mm2 pixel and 16 bits 1 in 65 536 gray scale in a minimum exposure time of one second moreover the safety concerns of working with high energy radiation are avoided the chambers used in the light transmission system were constructed using aluminum frames and 1 cm thick tempered glass plates fig 2 a rectangular 1 28 cm thick aluminum frame interior frame with an interior length of 55 cm and interior height of 45 cm served as a spacer between the two glass slides of the flow chamber the glass sheets were sealed to the spacer by viton strips 1 cm wide 1 6 mm thick and ge silicone on both faces of the spacer two external aluminum frames were placed on the exterior side of each glass plate and affixed together by 8 mm bolts to secure the glass plates to the inner frames and produce a watertight seal by compressing the viton strips the flow chamber was designed with an adjustable sealed lid to enable confined aquifer experiments the flow chamber was fitted with inlet and outlet wells to mix fluid before entering the media these inlet and outlet wells were screened with stainless steel mesh mesh size 100 and each well had a volume of 2 8 cm3 fig 2 thirteen ports spaced as shown in fig 2 were installed around the sandbox three of the ports 1 to 3 served as inlets three of them 6 to 8 served as outlets the top two injection ports ports 4 and 5 were fitted with brass valves swagelok b 41s2 attached to 3 175 mm o d steel tubes the steel tubes were open at the top end and attached to the valves closed at the bottom end inside the chamber and had 3 rows of 4 holes equally spaced around the tube and spaced vertically 5 mm apart starting 5 mm above the closed end the injection tubes were inserted into the chamber after packing the sand the other ports ports 1 3 and 6 13 were fitted with brass valves swagelok b 41s2 attached to polyfluoroalkoxy pfa tubes swagelok pfa t2 030 that reached to the interior wall of the chamber to keep a uniform hydrostatic pressure the outlet was maintained to a constant head slightly higher than the top of the chamber in the experiments ports 9 and 13 were connected to manometers yf 2000 fayitong china ports 10 12 served for kb 1tm inoculum and 100 mg l 1 methanol solution injection kb 1tm is a mixed culture provided by sirem guelph ontario canada commercial translucent c190 accusand 20 30 mesh unimin le sueur mn usa was used as the porous medium niemet and selker 2001 ye et al 2009 following the addition of each sand increment the sand was gently mixed to minimize layering and compacted prior to the addition of the subsequent sand increment the median grain size of the sand d50 was 0 073 cm and the uniformity index ui was 1 21 unimin le sueur mn usa for the 20 30 mesh sand the residual saturation was 0 046 niemet and selker 2001 schroth et al 1996 the same particle size sand was used here however the residual saturation is very sensitive to the pack the use of the residual saturation from other references rather than based on drainage of the sand packs used in these experiments could lead errors in the results the chambers were dry packed with sand and then was flushed 2 days with flow from bottom to up using degassing water which was heated over 25 min by high temperature sterilizing oven under the pressure of 0 12mpa first the background light intensity under water saturation condition iw was recorded tce was chosen as a representative napl phase which was dyed with 100 mg l oil red o sigma aldrich corporation to enhance visual observations and increase its light absorbance properties as required by the image analysis method used two chambers were set up to generate water gas systems before the injection of dyed napl one chamber contained air and the other contained biogenic gas for the air system the chamber was first filled with water that had been saturated with air to prevent air from dissolving in water during the injecting process then air was injected into the chamber through port 5 approximately 31 cm beneath the top in order to investigate how the injection rates influence migration of air in porous media air was designed to injected in a series of steps of different rate and duration air was injected with a syringe pump at a flow rate of 2 4 ml min for 5 min 0 6 ml min for 4 min 1 5 ml min for 10 min 2 0 ml min for 54 min 5 ml min for 4 min and 11 0 ml min for 6 min a total of 223 54 ml of water was drained from the chamber then about 197 37 ml of tce were injected with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 5 ml min through port 4 approximately 7 cm beneath the top the ccd camera was set to take an image every three minutes during the air injection and tce infiltration this was the first experiment e1 involving three phases water air and napl for the biogenic gas system the biogenic gases of methane and carbon dioxide were produced by kb 1 culture edwards and grbić galić 1994 a total of 200 ml of kb 1 culture was injected into the chamber through ports 10 11 and 12 with an addition of 250 ml of 500 mg l methanol every four days after 105 days approximately 263 01 ml of water was removed from the system with the production of gas by kb 1 then 173 38 ml of tce dyed with oil red o was added to the chamber with a syringe pump through port 5 about 5 cm beneath the top at a flow rate of 1 3 ml min the ccd camera took an image every hour during the biogenic gas generation and every minute during the tce infiltration process this was the second experiment e2 involving three phases water biogenic gas and napl 4 results and discussion 4 1 napl water air system as noted in section 3 the napl water gas system is based upon the known water gas system the saturation of the water gas system can be calculated with model c or model d proposed by niemet and selker 2001 to form the air distribution a volume of 223 54 ml of air was injected into the water saturated cell after two days 197 37 ml of dyed tce was then injected into the water air system the change in light intensities caused by air injection is shown in fig 3 a gas mainly moved upward from injecting port 5 approximately 31 cm below the top of the cell and spread in an inverse triangle in a finger and channel pattern fig 3a also shows an obvious 10 cm wide unsaturated zone after air injection fig 3b shows the change in light intensity caused by tce injection forming a napl water gas system according to previous experimental results with water gas and napl water conditions same as that in this study zhang et al 2014 an estimated mean value of c1 0 10 and c2 0 40 are applied here the temporal gas volumes predicted by models w g a and w g b vs water removed volumes are shown in fig 4 there were strong correlations between the predicted gas and water removed volumes model w g a r2 0 997 model w g b r2 0 994 the results of model w g a were all close to the solid line 1 1 and exhibited the best fit as niemet and selker 2001 discussed model c model w g a in this study performed fairy well overall for model w g b model d in the paper by niemet and selker 2001 the results were always located above the solid line this pattern indicates that model w g b overestimated the injected air volumes and the results of model w g b are greater than model w g a this is different from what niemet and selker 2001 reported niemet and selker 2001 reported that the production of model d w g b underestimated the water removed volume and was slighter smaller than model c w g a at the end of the air injection the volume of removed water from the cell was 223 54 ml and the gas volumes predicted by models w g a and w g b were 230 85 ml and 281 02 ml based on the integration of values of sabs g sg 1 sres corresponding the relative errors of 3 27 and 25 71 respectively an rmse value of 3 10 ml was calculated for model w g a the error was 1 39 when 223 54 ml of air was injected into the chamber the rmse of model w g b was 34 25 ml and the error reached 15 32 after air injection therefore model w g a gives a better fit for the water gas system with the proper parameter c1 0 10 the distribution of gas saturations calculated by model w g a and model w g b with c1 0 10 are shown in fig 5 a and 5b respectively fig 5a presents a pattern very similar to that in fig 5b at the inverse triangle area the gas saturations calculated by model w g b were greater than those of model w g a the spatially averaged value was 0 0396 when napl invades the known water gas system there are three possible conditions for a given pixel in the chamber if the pixel is saturated with water a napl water system will form after napl injection if the pixel is saturated with gas a napl gas system will form if the pixel is partly saturated with water then the napl water gas system will form lisms of one specified pixel would be chosen based on water saturated condition of the known water gas system before napl invading for those pixels saturated with water models for napl water system model n w a or model n w b would be applied to calculate the liquid saturation for those pixels saturated with air except water films then models for napl gas system model n g a or model n g b would be applied to calculate the liquid saturation in other cases models for napl water gas system would be chosen to calculate moreover the lisms applied to calculate napl saturation must be consistent with those used in the water gas system in terms of drainage e g if water saturation in the water gas system is calculated by model w g a napl saturation should be predicted by the n w g a model finally as noted in section 2 3 assumptions on the order of drainage water or gas are made for the four n w g models below one assumption is the drainage of water first until there is no free water which means that the gas saturation in n w g system is the same as that in the former water gas system and finally the system evolves into the n g system when all the free water has drained the other assumption is the drainage of gas first that is the water saturation in the n w g system is the same as that in the former water gas system and finally the system evolves into the n w system when all the gas has drained overall models n w g a based on two different assumptions of drainage order are model n w g a 1 expressed in the form of eq 19 and model n w g a 2 expressed in the form of eq 20 models n w g b are referred to model nwg b 1 eq 21 and model n w g b 2 eq 22 respectively according to the different assumptions assumption a b and assumption 1 2 there are four types model shown in table 1 the temporal napl volumes predicted by the four n w g models are shown in fig 6 four n w g models over predicted the volume of water removed from the chamber during the napl infiltration experiment overall as shown in fig 3a air formed a continuous gas distribution zone approximately 10 cm wide but the tce injection point was approximately 7 cm under port 4 dnapl moved mainly downward because it is denser than water in the air injection experiment only a small amount of gas was able to hinder the infiltration of tce therefore the results of the four models indicated similar tendency and were close to each other there were strong correlations between the infiltrated tce and water removed volumes among the four n w g models model n w g a 1 r2 0 976 model n w g a 2 r2 0 963 model n w g b 1 r2 0 980 model n w g b 2 r2 0 969 the models based on the assumption 1 drainage of water first output smaller napl volumes than those of assumption 2 e g the results of model n w g a 1 are smaller than n w g a 2 compared to the results of models n w g a 2 and n w g b 2 the results of models n w g a 1 and n w g b 1 are closer to the water removed volumes observed in the experiment this finding indicates that the different drainage order affects the results and that assumption 1 is more suitable to the conditions of experiment e1 because port 8 fig 2 served as the outlet during tce infiltration it was easy to drain water in this n w g system in comparison with different models model n w g a gives lower tce infiltration volumes than model n w g b for example the results of n w g a 1 and n w g a 2 are smaller than those of n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 respectively this finding shows the impact of different geometric simplifications on the results similarly to the napl water and water gas systems the results of the models based on assumption b are greater than those of models with assumption a fig 6 after 197 37 ml tce was injected into the chamber the calculated tce volumes with the four models models n w g a 1 n w g a 2 n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 were 191 92 ml 216 27 ml 208 14 ml and 237 88 ml respectively correspondingly the relative errors were 2 76 9 58 5 46 and 20 52 respectively the rmses of the four n w g models were 11 48 ml 34 66 ml 18 70 ml and 47 85 respectively when 197 37 ml of tce was present in the chamber the errors were 5 98 17 56 9 47 and 24 24 respectively in conclusion model n w g a 1 gives the best fit to the observations which is consistent with the results of models w g a fig 7 a shows the distribution of tce saturations calculated with model n w g a 1 with c1 0 10 and c2 0 40 and fig 7b provides the gas saturations in the cell after the injection of 197 37 ml of tce the values of c1 and c2 were obtained from the results of previous study as mentioned above combined with the distribution of gas saturations before tce injection fig 5a this comparison reveals where gas was drained after tce injection it should be noted that the same model model w g a was used to predict the gas saturation in these figures fig 7b and 5a a comparison of fig 7b and 5a reveals that only a small amount of gas 15 58 ml calculated by model n w g a 1 was drained from the chamber as shown in fig 7a and 7b a red ring high napl saturation zone exists around the high gas saturation zone because napl tended to displace in the system napl accumulated on the top the high gas saturation zone then bypassed it and finally moved downwards 4 2 napl water biogenic gas system the changes in light intensity for the water biogenic gas system before tce injection are shown in fig 8 a compared to the distribution of air fig 3a the biogenic gas bubbles spread out randomly and distributed discontinuously in the cell the finger and channel phenomenon is obvious in the biogenic gas condition drilling the sampling tube could cause the disturbance of sand around the tube and it led to the increase of the pore space around the tube according the wettability of gas and water the gas would occupy large pore spaces so some gas clusters are entrapped by water obvious red scattered points some sampling steel tubes trails above red dots in fig 8a were inserted into the chamber to collect water samples during the process of biogenic gas generation fig 8b shows the changes in light intensities caused by the injection of 173 38 ml of dyed tce into the water biogenic gas system the existing gases change the path of tce migration especially at the interface between water and gas this pattern also shows that the tce plume at the bottom of the cell is not uniform which is different from the air injection case e1 fig 3b there is no gas present at the bottom of the cell in e1 the existing gas in the biogenic gas case no matter where it is shows a great impact on the migration of tce forming irregular shape of tce plume the gas saturations calculated with model w g a and model w g b with c1 0 10 are shown in fig 9 a and 9b two figures in fig 9 show a similar shape of the change in light intensity to that in fig 8a the gas saturations predicted by model w g b were mostly greater than those predicted by model w g a the difference in spatially averaged value of the saturation between model w g b and w g a was 0 2089 the volume of removed water from the cell before tce injection was 323 01 ml the gas volumes calculated with models w g a and w g b were 303 28 ml and 567 60 ml respectively the relative errors were 6 11 for model w g a and 75 72 for model w g b in comparison with e1 the difference between the results saturations and calculated volumes of models w g a and w g b were more significant in the biogenic gas system in the biogenic gas system gas commonly coexists with water for a given pixel in the chamber e2 fig 8a that is some of pores are filled with water and some are filled with gas this condition contributes to the obvious difference between models w g a and w g b the result shows that model w g a is more suitable here and that individual drainage is preferable the water removed volumes calculated with the four n w g models are shown in fig 10 there were good correlations between the calculated and measured water removed volumes for the four n w g models except for n w g b 2 with relative weak correlations model n w g a 1 r2 0 996 model n w g a 2 r2 0 951 model n w g b 1 r2 0 980 model n w g b 2 r2 0 828 in the biogenic gas system e2 the results of model n w g a 1 which assumed that each fluid filled a single pore entirely except for water films and that water drained first fit the measured data very well this finding indicates that assumption 1 drainage of water first is more suitable here compared to different models model n w g b 1 resulted in lower water removed volumes than model n w g a 1 which is different from the air injection case e1 as noted above biogenic gas or bubbles scatter randomly and discontinuously in the cell causing substantial differences between the results of models w g a and w g b smaller volumes of water were predicted by model w g b so that there is less water that can be drained from the chamber during tce infiltration causing the results obtained with model n w g b 1 to be lower than those obtained with model n w g a 1 with 173 38 ml tce injected into the chamber the calculated tce volumes of the four models models n w g a 1 n w g a 2 n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 were 171 42 ml 353 13 ml 117 82 ml and 333 69 ml respectively correspondingly the relative errors were 1 13 103 67 47 16 and 92 46 respectively the four models provide the means to calculate the fluid saturation in the complicated napl water biogenic gas system an rmse of 3 60 ml was calculated for model n w g a 1 when 173 38 ml of napl was present in the chamber the relative error was 2 08 in conclusion model n w g a 1 provided the best fit among the four n w g models same as that in the air injection case which assumes that each fluid fills a single pore entirely and water drains first from a water gas system when napl invaded fig 11 shows the distribution of napl and gas saturations calculated with model n w g a 1 with c1 0 10 and c2 0 40 after tce injection as mentioned above the values of c1 and c2 were obtained from the previous experiments zhang et al 2014 as shown in fig 11 the distribution of tce saturation is complicated and generally similar to that in fig 8b similar to e1 assumption 1 drainage of water first is more suitable for the experiment e2 because of the design of the outlet during the tce infiltration the design of the outlet allows water to drain easily from the chamber at the same time gas moves upward and decreases the light intensities however assumption 2 drainage of gas first assumes that gas will be drained from the chamber first which is not suitable for the tce infiltration experiment here for other conditions such as the air sparging applied to the napl water system air napl or both might be displaced first in that case lisms with assumption 2 might be selected the lisms provide a means to calculate the saturation in napl water gas systems in the condition of napl displacing gas or water in water gas systems moreover the spatially constant values for c1 and c2 are used in the lisms which simplifies the models and give reasonable results 5 conclusions a simple noninvasive light transmission imaging technique was used to measure in situ gas organic liquid and water distribution in a three fluid phase system this method required minimal use of special equipment and allowed for quantification of fluid saturations of multi phases in flow cell systems under dynamic conditions four n w g models model n w g a 1 n w g a 2 n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 were developed and tested in napl water air and napl water biogenic gas systems the innovative lisms were proved effective at realizing continuous quantitative and dynamic full field mapping of napl water and gas saturations simultaneously model n w g a 1 exhibited the best fitting results in both cases and showed the strongest linear correction between calculated results and measured data r2 of 0 974 for air condition and r2 of 0 996 for biogenic gas condition it indicates that the model n w g a 1 with the assumptions of individual drainage assumption a and of water draining firstly assumption 1 performs best among all the four lisms which means the two assumptions a and 1 combined together are more suitable at least for the n w g system in this study credit authorship contribution statement yanhong zhang methodology writing original draft jichun wu writing review editing shujun ye

4656,determining transient fluid saturations in a multi phase system is important for understanding the system s flow characteristics and performing effective subsurface remediation this paper investigates the models to quantify the fluid saturations of three phases of napl water gas in 2d porous media systems using a noninvasive light transmission technique four light intensity saturation models lisms to quantify fluid saturations from light intensities with only two parameters are proposed four lisms can be divided into two classes one based on assumption a of individual drainage and the other based on assumption b of combined drainage lisms are verified by two experiments conducted in napl invading into water air and water biogenic gas conditions respectively results show that the model which based on assumption a and drainage of water first is the best type and show the strongest linear correlation between calculated results and measured data r2 of 0 974 for air condition and r2 of 0 996 for biogenic gas condition this study developed the innovative lisms and applied them to three phases of napl water gas systems which provides a methodology to acquire effective three fluid saturations in a continuous quantitative and real time way keywords multi phase fluid saturation napl water gas light transmission porous media 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napls such as gasoline range petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents are frequently detected groundwater contaminants at hazardous waste sites hou and lu 2018 kechavarzi et al 2005 2000 napls typically have low solubilities napls released to the subsurface can partition into the groundwater representing a potential long term contamination source there has been a aconsiderable interest in the problem of multi phase flow related to napls contamination in recent years chevalier 2003 darnault et al 1998 detwiler et al 2001 fure et al 2006 rimmer et al 1998 carroll et al 2015 zhong et al

the lowest cost alternative ltv was first developed by hoa 1981 to quantify saturation in a sand filled chamber based on light refraction theory an independent empirical calibration curve between light intensity and saturation was required in his method tidwell and glass 1994 developed a mathematical model to calculate saturation from light intensity measurements by assuming an individual drainage conceptual model wherein each pore was either full or empty of water this method correlated the number of pores filled with water to water saturation and the number of pores across the thickness of the models k which was a fitting empirical parameter and calculated for each experiment a major contribution to this method was achieved by niemet and selker 2001 five physically based models for predicting liquid saturation from light transmission in 2d laboratory systems containing translucent porous media were developed and tested niemet and selker 2001 five physical relationships model a e relating light transmission to liquid saturation were developed based upon various simplifying assumptions concerning pore geometry wettability and drainage characteristics the parameter k was mathematically calculated pixel by pixel from light intensity of dry and water saturated models o carroll et al 2007 applied one of five models model a of niemet and selker 2001 to quantify napl saturation in n w system fluid saturations were estimated by correlating normalized light intensity to the napl saturation to enhance its visual observation the napl was dyed with 0 035 by weight sudan iii in the n w system bob et al 2008 presented a modified method based on ltv for dnapl saturation measurements which was essentially only based on model c developed by niemet and selker 2001 the method was verified by three types of napl water experiments including undyed and dyed pce perchloroethylene and there was a good agreement between the results obtained and ltv methods also bob et al 2008 proposed that their method can be expanded to measure fluid contents in three phase system deng et al 2017 applied the method proposed by bob et al 2008 to provide high resolution saturation data while the electrical resistivity tomography ert method was applied to capture the change of resistivity in a laboratory sandbox wang et al 2008 used the method developed from models a and c of niemet and selker 2001 a binary method and a novel multiphase wavelength method to quantify napl mass and mass reduction in a 2d laboratory flow chamber for the n w system results showed that model c of niemet and selker 2001 with the assumption of wetting media of uniform pore size and the multiple wavelength model with no interface structure assumption were able to accurately quantify pce mass reduction during surfactant flushing zhang et al 2014 proposed simplified models to predict fluid saturation in water gas system and napl water system with only one parameter which are easier to apply comparing with the models developed by nimet and selker 2001 and that by bob et al 2008 both with 6 parameters zhao et al 2015 developed an improved light transmission method in which transmission images were captured by a 10 000 000 pixel digital camera to study lnapl migration and distribution pattern all the previous studies involved two phase system water gas or napl water the primary objective of this work is to develop light intensity saturation models lisms to determine fluid saturation in napl water gas n w g systems using the light transmission technique the method is an extension of earlier methods by tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2001 bob et al 2008 and zhang et al 2014 to our best knowledge it is the first attempt to quantify liquid saturation of n w g system in laboratory experiments two relationships relating light transmission to fluid saturation with different assumptions regarding drainage were developed for n w g system these relationships were applied and verified in two experiments conducted in a 2d coarse sand system with three phases of n w g 2 light intensity saturation models at the pore scale light propagates through solid liquid and gas phase constituents each with a separate absorption coefficient for a specific wavelength of light the measured light intensity i transmitted through a medium of thickness dj can be described by combining beer s law and fresnel s law niemet and selker 2001 1 i c i in τ i k exp α j d j where iin is the intensity of the incident light τi k is light transmittance across the interface between phases i and k as defined by fresnel s law αj is the light absorption coefficient of medium j e g sand particles and dyed napl absorb light at wavelengths used in our experiment visible light range but the absorption by air and water is negligible bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 c is a geometric correction factor that may be omitted for collimated light or if the source and media are approximately equidistant from the detector bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 wang et al 2008 many common aquifer materials such as quartz and carbonates are water wetting selker et al 1999 a reasonable assumption is that a water film coats the particles and an effective pore space exists between the liquid films but not between the sand grains as shown in fig 1 denoted as models c and d by niemet and selker 2001 additionally because of napl films existing between air and water light intensity losses between solid and water films is much more than between water air films and napl films so films of napl existing between air and water are not considered in the model simplification fig 1 consider a porous medium that is idealized as uniform cubic particles of width ds there can be two types of drainage assumptions a a specified phase such as water napl or gas fills a single pore entirely when it is displaced by another material b the effective pores drain in a combined incremental manner and each pore contains the same fraction of the specified phases fig 1 the fraction of water volume held within the films is constant and equal to the residual saturation sres this assumption was based on the condition that a porous media was initially saturated with water was drained by gas then napl however it could lead to inaccuracies if a porous medium was initially saturated with water drained by napl then by air the absolute water saturation sabs w is related to the effective saturation sw as follows 2 s abs w s w 1 s res s res models to predict fluid saturation in water gas system and napl water system are detailedly expressed in the paper by zhang et al 2014 as for the napl water gas three phase system because of ig io iw the intensity of refracted light is controlled by the fraction of water napl and gas new models to predict the water napl and gas saturations are developed as follows 2 1 model to predict napl water gas saturation with the assumption of wetting media of uniform pore size with individual drainage model n w g a assume that the interstitial pores drain individually randomly and completely a pore is either full of napl or water assumption a in fig 1 neglecting absorption by the water phase eq 1 can be used to describe the intensity of light transmitted through the media i as follows 3 i c i in τ s w 2 k τ w o 2 k s o τ w g 2 k s g exp α s l s exp α do s o l where k is the number of particles or pores across the media thickness s o is the effective napl saturation sg is the effective gas saturation and s o s w s g 1 τs w is the transmittance of the solid water interface τw o is the transmittance of the water napl interface αs and αdo are the absorption coefficients of the solid particles and dyed napl respectively l is the pore space across the media chamber thickness times porosity and ls is the thickness of solid particles and is expressed as 4 l s d s k additionally the napl saturation s o is an effective saturation and the absolute napl saturation s abs o is as follows 5 s abs o s o 1 s res if the chamber is saturated with water and light absorption in water is neglected the light intensity iw can be expressed as follows 6 i w c i in τ s w 2 k exp α s l s if residual water in the form of water films is present and the effective pore space is saturated with dyed napl the light intensity io can be expressed as follows 7 i o c i in τ s w 2 k τ w o 2 k exp α s l s exp α do l if residual water is present and the effective pore space is saturated with gas the 2d system is fully saturated with water and is then fully drained by injecting gas to the cell and neglecting the absorption of gas the light intensity ig can be expressed as follows 8 i g c i in τ s w 2 k τ w g 2 k exp α s l s to calculate the saturation of a specific phase in a napl water gas system when napl is infiltrating into a water gas system the displacement of water or gas during napl infiltration is presumed one assumption is that only water is drained and sg maintains a constant value of sg1 which is the gas saturation of the known water gas system before napl injection combining eqs 6 7 8 and 3 yields 9 s o ln i i w s g 1 ln i g i w ln i o i w the other assumption is that gas is drained and sw maintains a constant value of sw1 which is the water saturation of the known water gas system before napl injection the substitution of eqs 6 7 and 8 into 3 yields 10 s o ln i i w 1 s w 1 ln i g i w ln i o i w ln i g i w 2 2 model to predict napl water gas saturation with the assumption of wetting media of uniform pore size with combined drainage model n w g b assuming all pores across the media thickness have the same water napl and gas content the fraction of napl filled pore space is equal to the effective degree of napl saturation s o assumption b in fig 1 neglecting absorption by the water phase eq 1 becomes 11 i c i in τ s w 2 k s w τ s w 2 k τ w g 2 k s g exp α s l s τ s w 2 k τ w o 2 k s

substitution of eqs 6 7 and 8 into 11 yields 13 s o i i g s w 1 i w i g i o i g the total volume of specified phase in the chamber vα can be estimated by 14 v α j 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 s α a t θ where sα is the absolute saturation of the specified phase subscript α indicates napl water or gas a is the area of each pixel t is the thickness of each pixel θ is the porosity of the porous medium and n1 and n2 are the number of pixels along the x and y axes respectively 2 3 light intensity saturation models expressed with parameters c1 and c2 eqs 6 and 8 can be combined to obtain 15 i g i w τ w g 2 k where k is the number of particles or pores across the medium thickness relating to the property of the porous medium and the degree of compaction τw g in eq 11 is the transmittance of the water gas interface which is only associated with the properties of liquids wang et al 2008 once the chamber is installed k and τw g are considered constant during the experiment then the ig iw ratio is considered to be constant and is denoted by c1 zhang et al 2014 c1 is characteristic of the experimental system and not just of the sand theoretically c1 for water gas system was obtained using images of a water saturated and a drained air water pack a reference value of c1 0 200 0 015 for 20 30 mesh sand was obtained by the corresponding data given by niemet and selker 2001 model c and model d by niemet and selker 2001 renamed model w g a and w g b here respectively are transferred into eqs 16 and 17 with the parameter c1 model w g a model c by niemet and selker 2001 using c1 is 16 s g ln i i

bob et al 2008 which is related to the transmission factor for the water oil interface τw o and the total number of pores across the thickness of the chamber k k can be calculated from the dry id and water saturated iw light intensities as proposed by niemet and selker 2001 for dyed pce the transmission factor for the dyed pce water interface is determined by mass balance calibration however if the wet packing method is used it is difficult to practically obtain id in the laboratory the parameter k which was a key parameter in previous models niemet and selker 2001 is in fact difficult to obtain therefore the io iw ratio is denoted as c2 for the napl water system zhang et al 2014 from eq 18 the parameter c2 correlates to the property of liquids τw o αdo and the porous medium k l c2 could be obtained in the laboratory by measuring io and iw c2 is constant for a specific pixel in a chamber and can show spatial variation due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium models n w g a

fluids in a chamber the light transmission system included a coupled charge device ccd camera ap2e apogee instruments auburn ca associated with its software maxim dl ottawa on a flow chamber and a light bank lighting of the chamber was only provided by the light bank mounted 12 5 cm from the chamber to isolate heat transfer between the light bank and chamber the light bank consisted of 6 fluorescent tubes panasonic yz18rr6500k and was mounted behind a diffuser to homogenize the incident light the ccd camera was installed 1 8 m from the chamber in a wooden enclosure the wooden enclosure ensured that only light passing through the chamber from the light bank was captured by the ccd camera a 543 10 nm band pass filter was placed on the camera lens pc nikkor 1 2 8f 35 mm nippon kogaku japan to maximize the camera s sensitivity to migrating fluids the utilization of a ccd camera in light transmission systems provides a nearly instantaneous high density array of spatial measurements over a very large dynamic range whereas long count times and or small point wise measurements are typical of the other methods the systems employed here are capable of obtaining a 1536

energy radiation are avoided the chambers used in the light transmission system were constructed using aluminum frames and 1 cm thick tempered glass plates fig 2 a rectangular 1 28 cm thick aluminum

viton strips 1 cm wide 1 6 mm thick and ge silicone on both faces of the spacer two external aluminum frames were placed on the exterior side of each glass plate and affixed together by 8 mm bolts to secure the glass plates to the inner frames and produce a watertight seal by compressing the viton strips the flow chamber was designed with an adjustable sealed lid to enable confined aquifer

translucent c190 accusand 20 30 mesh unimin le sueur mn usa was used as the porous medium niemet and selker 2001 ye et al 2009 following the addition of each sand increment the sand was gently mixed to minimize layering and compacted prior to the addition of the subsequent sand increment the median grain size of the sand d50 was 0 073 cm and the uniformity index ui was 1 21 unimin le sueur mn usa for the 20 30 mesh sand the residual saturation was 0 046 niemet and selker 2001 schroth et al 1996 the same particle size sand was used here however the residual saturation is very sensitive to the pack the use of the residual saturation from other references rather than based on drainage of the sand packs used in these experiments could lead errors in the results the chambers were dry packed with sand and then was flushed 2 days with flow from bottom to up using degassing water which was heated over 25 min by high temperature sterilizing oven under the pressure of 0 12mpa first the background light intensity under water saturation condition iw was recorded tce was chosen as a representative napl phase which was dyed with 100 mg l oil red o sigma aldrich corporation to enhance visual observations and increase its light absorbance properties as required by the image analysis method used two chambers were set up to generate water gas systems before the injection of dyed napl one chamber contained air and the other contained biogenic gas for the air system the chamber was first filled with water that had been saturated with air to prevent air from dissolving in water during the injecting process then air was injected into the chamber through port 5 approximately 31 cm beneath the top in order to investigate how the injection rates influence migration of air in porous media air was designed to injected in a series of steps of different rate and duration air was injected with a syringe pump at a flow rate of 2 4 ml min for 5 min 0 6 ml min for 4 min 1 5 ml min for 10 min 2 0 ml min for 54 min 5 ml min for 4 min and 11 0 ml min for 6 min a total of 223 54 ml of water was drained from the chamber then about 197 37 ml of tce were injected with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 5 ml min through port 4 approximately 7 cm beneath the top the ccd camera was set to take an image every three minutes during the air injection and tce infiltration this was the first experiment e1 involving three phases water air and napl for the biogenic gas system the biogenic gases of methane and carbon dioxide were produced by kb 1 culture edwards and grbić galić 1994 a total of 200 ml of kb 1 culture was injected into the chamber through ports 10 11 and 12 with an addition of 250 ml of 500 mg l methanol every four days after 105 days approximately 263 01 ml of water was removed from the system with the production of gas by kb 1 then 173 38 ml of tce dyed with oil red o was added to the chamber with a syringe pump through port 5 about 5 cm beneath the top at a flow rate of 1 3 ml min the ccd camera took an image every hour during the biogenic gas generation and every minute during the tce infiltration process this was the second experiment e2 involving three phases water biogenic gas and napl 4 results and discussion 4 1 napl water air system as noted in section 3 the napl water gas system is based upon the known water gas system the saturation of the water gas system can be calculated with model c or model d proposed by niemet and selker 2001 to form the air distribution a volume of 223 54 ml of air was injected into the water saturated cell after two days 197 37 ml of dyed tce was then injected into the water air system the change in light intensities caused by air injection is shown in fig 3 a gas mainly moved upward from injecting port 5 approximately 31 cm below the top of the cell and spread in an inverse triangle in a finger and channel pattern fig 3a also shows an obvious 10 cm wide unsaturated zone after air injection fig 3b shows the change in light intensity caused by tce injection forming a napl water gas system according to previous experimental results with water gas and napl water conditions same as that in this study zhang et al 2014 an estimated mean value of c1 0 10 and c2 0 40 are applied here the temporal gas volumes predicted by models w g a and w g b vs water removed volumes are shown in fig 4 there were strong correlations between the predicted gas and water removed volumes model w g a r2 0 997 model w g b r2 0 994 the results of model w g a were all close to the solid line 1 1 and exhibited the best fit as niemet and selker 2001 discussed model c model w g a in this study performed fairy well overall for model w g b model d in the paper by niemet and selker 2001 the results were always located above the solid line this pattern indicates that model w g b overestimated the injected air volumes and the results of model w g b are greater than model w g a this is different from what niemet and selker 2001 reported niemet and selker 2001 reported that the production of model d w g b underestimated the water removed volume and was slighter smaller than model c w g a at the end of the air injection the volume of removed water from the cell was 223 54 ml and the gas volumes predicted by models w g a and w g b were 230 85 ml and 281 02 ml based on the integration of values of sabs g sg 1 sres corresponding the relative errors of 3 27 and 25 71 respectively an rmse value of 3 10 ml was calculated for model w g a the error was 1 39 when 223 54 ml of air was injected into the chamber the rmse of model w g b was 34 25 ml and the error reached 15 32 after air injection therefore model w g a gives a better fit for the water gas system with the proper parameter c1 0 10 the distribution of gas saturations calculated by model w g a and model w g b with c1 0 10 are shown in fig 5 a and 5b respectively fig 5a presents a pattern very similar to that in fig 5b at the inverse triangle area the gas saturations calculated by model w g b were greater than those of model w g a the spatially averaged value was 0 0396 when napl invades the known water gas system there are three possible conditions for a given pixel in the chamber if the pixel is saturated with water a napl water system will form after napl injection if the pixel is saturated with gas a napl gas system will form if the pixel is partly saturated with water then the napl water gas system will form lisms of one specified pixel would be chosen based on water saturated condition of the known water gas system before napl invading for those pixels saturated with water models for napl water system model n w a or model n w b would be applied to calculate the liquid saturation for those pixels saturated with air except water films then models for napl gas system model n g a or model n g b would be applied to calculate the liquid saturation in other cases models for napl water gas system would be chosen to calculate moreover the lisms applied to calculate napl saturation must be consistent with those used in the water gas system in terms of drainage e g if water saturation in the water gas system is calculated by model w g a napl saturation should be predicted by the n w g a model finally as noted in section 2 3 assumptions on the order of drainage water or gas are made for the four n w g models below one assumption is the drainage of water first until there is no free water which means that the gas saturation in n w g system is the same as that in the former water gas system and finally the system evolves into the n g system when all the free water has drained the other assumption is the drainage of gas first that is the water saturation in the n w g system is the same as that in the former water gas system and finally the system evolves into the n w system when all the gas has drained overall models n w g a based on two different assumptions of drainage order are model n w g a 1 expressed in the form of eq 19 and model n w g a 2 expressed in the form of eq 20 models n w g b are referred to model nwg b 1 eq 21 and model n w g b 2 eq 22 respectively according to the different assumptions assumption a b and assumption 1 2 there are four types model shown in table 1 the temporal napl volumes predicted by the four n w g models are shown in fig 6 four n w g models over predicted the volume of water removed from the chamber during the napl infiltration experiment overall as shown in fig 3a air formed a continuous gas distribution zone approximately 10 cm wide but the tce injection point was approximately 7 cm under port 4 dnapl moved mainly downward because it is denser than water in the air injection experiment only a small amount of gas was able to hinder the infiltration of tce therefore the results of the four models indicated similar tendency and were close to each other there were strong correlations between the infiltrated tce and water removed volumes among the four n w g models model n w g a 1 r2 0 976 model n w g a 2 r2 0 963 model n w g b 1 r2 0 980 model n w g b 2 r2 0 969 the models based on the assumption 1 drainage of water first output smaller napl volumes than those of assumption 2 e g the results of model n w g a 1 are smaller than n w g a 2 compared to the results of models n w g a 2 and n w g b 2 the results of models n w g a 1 and n w g b 1 are closer to the water removed volumes observed in the experiment this finding indicates that the different drainage order affects the results and that assumption 1 is more suitable to the conditions of experiment e1 because port 8 fig 2 served as the outlet during tce infiltration it was easy to drain water in this n w g system in comparison with different models model n w g a gives lower tce infiltration volumes than model n w g b for example the results of n w g a 1 and n w g a 2 are smaller than those of n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 respectively this finding shows the impact of different geometric simplifications on the results similarly to the napl water and water gas systems the results of the models based on assumption b are greater than those of models with assumption a fig 6 after 197 37 ml tce was injected into the chamber the calculated tce volumes with the four models models n w g a 1 n w g a 2 n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 were 191 92 ml 216 27 ml 208 14 ml and 237 88 ml respectively correspondingly the relative errors were 2 76 9 58 5 46 and 20 52 respectively the rmses of the four n w g models were 11 48 ml 34 66 ml 18 70 ml and 47 85 respectively when 197 37 ml of tce was present in the chamber the errors were 5 98 17 56 9 47 and 24 24 respectively in conclusion model n w g a 1 gives the best fit to the observations which is consistent with the results of models w g a fig 7 a shows the distribution of tce saturations calculated with model n w g a 1 with c1 0 10 and c2 0 40 and fig 7b provides the gas saturations in the cell after the injection of 197 37 ml of tce the values of c1 and c2 were obtained from the results of previous study as mentioned above combined with the distribution of gas saturations before tce injection fig 5a this comparison reveals where gas was drained after tce injection it should be noted that the same model model w g a was used to predict the gas saturation in these figures fig 7b and 5a a comparison of fig 7b and 5a reveals that only a small amount of gas 15 58 ml calculated by model n w g a 1 was drained from the chamber as shown in fig 7a and 7b a red ring high napl saturation zone exists around the high gas saturation zone because napl tended to displace in the system napl accumulated on the top the high gas saturation zone then bypassed it and finally moved downwards 4 2 napl water biogenic gas system the changes in light intensity for the water biogenic gas system before tce injection are shown in fig 8 a compared to the distribution of air fig 3a the biogenic gas bubbles spread out randomly and distributed discontinuously in the cell the finger and channel phenomenon is obvious in the biogenic gas condition drilling the sampling tube could cause the disturbance of sand around the tube and it led to the increase of the pore space around the tube according the wettability of gas and water the gas would occupy large pore spaces so some gas clusters are entrapped by water obvious red scattered points some sampling steel tubes trails above red dots in fig 8a were inserted into the chamber to collect water samples during the process of biogenic gas generation fig 8b shows the changes in light intensities caused by the injection of 173 38 ml of dyed tce into the water biogenic gas system the existing gases change the path of tce migration especially at the interface between water and gas this pattern also shows that the tce plume at the bottom of the cell is not uniform which is different from the air injection case e1 fig 3b there is no gas present at the bottom of the cell in e1 the existing gas in the biogenic gas case no matter where it is shows a great impact on the migration of tce forming irregular shape of tce plume the gas saturations calculated with model w g a and model w g b with c1 0 10 are shown in fig 9 a and 9b two figures in fig 9 show a similar shape of the change in light intensity to that in fig 8a the gas saturations predicted by model w g b were mostly greater than those predicted by model w g a the difference in spatially averaged value of the saturation between model w g b and w g a was 0 2089 the volume of removed water from the cell before tce injection was 323 01 ml the gas volumes calculated with models w g a and w g b were 303 28 ml and 567 60 ml respectively the relative errors were 6 11 for model w g a and 75 72 for model w g b in comparison with e1 the difference between the results saturations and calculated volumes of models w g a and w g b were more significant in the biogenic gas system in the biogenic gas system gas commonly coexists with water for a given pixel in the chamber e2 fig 8a that is some of pores are filled with water and some are filled with gas this condition contributes to the obvious difference between models w g a and w g b the result shows that model w g a is more suitable here and that individual drainage is preferable the water removed volumes calculated with the four n w g models are shown in fig 10 there were good correlations between the calculated and measured water removed volumes for the four n w g models except for n w g b 2 with relative weak correlations model n w g a 1 r2 0 996 model n w g a 2 r2 0 951 model n w g b 1 r2 0 980 model n w g b 2 r2 0 828 in the biogenic gas system e2 the results of model n w g a 1 which assumed that each fluid filled a single pore entirely except for water films and that water drained first fit the measured data very well this finding indicates that assumption 1 drainage of water first is more suitable here compared to different models model n w g b 1 resulted in lower water removed volumes than model n w g a 1 which is different from the air injection case e1 as noted above biogenic gas or bubbles scatter randomly and discontinuously in the cell causing substantial differences between the results of models w g a and w g b smaller volumes of water were predicted by model w g b so that there is less water that can be drained from the chamber during tce infiltration causing the results obtained with model n w g b 1 to be lower than those obtained with model n w g a 1 with 173 38 ml tce injected into the chamber the calculated tce volumes of the four models models n w g a 1 n w g a 2 n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 were 171 42 ml 353 13 ml 117 82 ml and 333 69 ml respectively correspondingly the relative errors were 1 13 103 67 47 16 and 92 46 respectively the four models provide the means to calculate the fluid saturation in the complicated napl water biogenic gas system an rmse of 3 60 ml was calculated for model n w g a 1 when 173 38 ml of napl was present in the chamber the relative error was 2 08 in conclusion model n w g a 1 provided the best fit among the four n w g models same as that in the air injection case which assumes that each fluid fills a single pore entirely and water drains first from a water gas system when napl invaded fig 11 shows the distribution of napl and gas saturations calculated with model n w g a 1 with c1 0 10 and c2 0 40 after tce injection as mentioned above the values of c1 and c2 were obtained from the previous experiments zhang et al 2014 as shown in fig 11 the distribution of tce saturation is complicated and generally similar to that in fig 8b similar to e1 assumption 1 drainage of water first is more suitable for the experiment e2 because of the design of the outlet during the tce infiltration the design of the outlet allows water to drain easily from the chamber at the same time gas moves upward and decreases the light intensities however assumption 2 drainage of gas first assumes that gas will be drained from the chamber first which is not suitable for the tce infiltration experiment here for other conditions such as the air sparging applied to the napl water system air napl or both might be displaced first in that case lisms with assumption 2 might be selected the lisms provide a means to calculate the saturation in napl water gas systems in the condition of napl displacing gas or water in water gas systems moreover the spatially constant values for c1 and c2 are used in the lisms which simplifies the models and give reasonable results 5 conclusions a simple noninvasive light transmission imaging technique was used to measure in situ gas organic liquid and water distribution in a three fluid phase system this method required minimal use of special equipment and allowed for quantification of fluid saturations of multi phases in flow cell systems under dynamic conditions four n w g models model n w g a 1 n w g a 2 n w g b 1 and n w g b 2 were developed and tested in napl water air and napl water biogenic gas systems the innovative lisms were proved effective at realizing continuous quantitative and dynamic full field mapping of napl water and gas saturations simultaneously model n w g a 1 exhibited the best fitting results in both cases and showed the strongest linear correction between calculated results and measured data r2 of 0 974 for air condition and r2 of 0 996 for biogenic gas condition it indicates that the model n w g a 1 with the assumptions of individual drainage assumption a and of water draining firstly assumption 1 performs best among all the four lisms which means the two assumptions a and 1 combined together are more suitable at least for the n w g system in this study credit authorship contribution statement yanhong zhang methodology writing original draft jichun wu writing review editing shujun ye

4657,flooding and flood inundation are key hydrological characteristics of meander loop rivers however the effects of extreme floods on river morphology and spatial patterns of erosion and deposition are poorly understood a detailed geomorphologic change detection and sediment erosion process caused by an extreme flood more than 100 year recurrence interval discharge on 14 apr 2016 was surveyed for a single urban meander loop of the karoon river iran the studied meander loop is located next to the city of the ahavz and has a centerline length of about 14 km the bathymetry in 8892 stable points was measured also the detailed bathymetry layers for before 8 apr 2016 and after 24 apr 2016 the extreme flood event were compared geomorphological change detection gcd results show that in the studied reach about 106 ha of bank erosion was detected with a total volume of approximately 450 600 m3 furthermore total volume of surface lowering and the total volume of surface rising volumes that were obtained were 95421 6 m3 and 98619 0 m3 respectively the talweg length of the studied meander loop decreased about 126 m and the average depth decreased from 3 71 m to 3 14 m after the flood event channel widening as a consequence of the extreme flood was found to be about 21 m 17 the findings of this study indicate that extreme floods play an important role in the sediment budget and

gordon and meentemeyer 2006a price and leigh 2006 vadnais et al 2012 overeem et al 2013 there are various classifications for flood events including catastrophic floods flash floods extreme floods and large floods dong et al 2007 hooke 2016a 2015 flash floods within some hours to days rise and fall rapidly and are depending on the size of the river system usually borga et al 2008 this flood events have high discharge velocities and a high range of energy within the channel and over the floodplain borga et al 2008 hooke 2016a hand et al 2004 mentioned that flash floods are the most extreme hydrological events that have happened during the last four decades in united kingdom at watershed scale different types of floods may occur in the channel and floodplain corridor in response to an extreme rainfall event extreme large and flash floods these hydrologic events and especially the extreme floods have a very important role in fluvial geomorphology evolution poole 2002 borga et al 2007 hall et al 2014 dong et al 2016 sanjuán et al 2016 significant morphological changes in river corridors over short timescales are either due to human interventions including reservoir dams

river widening and many other geomorphological changes including channel migration deposition and floodplain scouring hajdukiewicz et al 2016 investigated the impact of a large flood on the mountainous fluvial system river dynamic and valley infrastructure in the biała river in the polish carpathians they found that floods with a recurrence interval larger than 80 years cause significant channel widening and incision in fluvial systems elina et al 2013 studied the effects of a flood event on spatio temporal change of fluvial morphology in meandering point bars they found that the variation in river discharge control the transverse shifting and as a consequence has an important impact on the point bar changes also erosion mainly takes place during high flow discharges semi arid ecosystems commonly have more extreme floods than other types of climates farquharson et al 1992 osterkamp and friedman 2000 alexandrov et al 2007 hooke 2016b studied morphological changes due to flow events in a spanish semi arid region where the climatic situation is similar to iran therefore the effects of an extreme flood may be expected to be similar results of the mentioned study showed that channel morphology did not transform with low flow discharges that move the sediment materials in se spain hooke 2016a investigated the geomorphological changes of a fluvial system by an extreme flood and the results showed the extreme flood have major impacts by deposition of flat bars in a braided reach masselink et al 2017 mentioned that in regions with semi arid climate intensive hydrological events move more sediment to the stream network while the smaller events transfer the sediment materials out of the stream network systems over time ruiz villanueva et al 2018 investigated in a study in the emma river switzerland the impacts of a large flood in a mountain watershed they found that along the emme river an intensive flood with a recurrence interval of 150 years has consequences on wide inundations large over bank deposition and have damages on buildings and infrastructure systems the present study is a follow up from the previous study by yousefi et al 2018a and mirzaee et al 2018 in which in the karoon river iran they have investigated the effects of an extreme flood on river morphology in the previous study they have focused on a 155 km long reach of the karoon river using landsat data they studied the relationship between different riverside land use types and the morphological changes that found after the large flood event in this study a new data source was used an accurate bathymetry that enables the analysis of sedimentation deposition and incision erosion values at that moment which is a bridge to better understanding of effects of extreme flood on meander river geomorphology the aim of this study is to further quantify the morphological change to understand the sedimentation and erosion processes in the largest urban meandering loop of karoon river in response to an extreme flood on 14 april 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the karoon river watershed is located in the sw of iran as a sub watershed of the persian gulf mega

of a studied meander loop is about 14 km mean annual flow discharge at ahvaz hydrometric gauging station 48 39 20 e 31 18 27 n during the period 1972 2016 was 504 m3s 1 while maximum recorded annual discharge was 2756 m3s 1 yousefi et al 2016 the recorded peak discharge of the flood event in april 2016 was at 4800 m3s 1 fig 2 which was the highest observed discharge in the 44 year period of measurement at the ahvaz gauging station based on log pearson type iii analysis the 100 year and 50 year recurrence interval discharges in ahwaz hydrometric station are 2342 m3s 1 and 2090 m3s 1 respectively salarijazi 2012 yousefi et al 2016 2 2 methods in the current study the landsat oli operational land imager images for 8 april 2016 before flood and 24 april 2016 after flood were used in addition the bathymetric data for the study reach were obtained from the regional water company in khozestan province for 08 04 2016 and 24 04 2016 the bathymetry was measured in 10 m 10 m designed fishnet in stable points for before and after a flood in bathymetry process we have used 3 ferquency gps to find measurement locations for both measuring dates totally 8892 stable points were used to measure river depth for before and after a flood event using the idw interpolation tool in arc gis 10 4 the raster bathymetry layers with a 5 m pixel size were produced for both before and after the flood dates notebaert et al 2009 gioia et al 2014 hopkins and snyder 2016 in addition based on the bathymetry points the triangular irregular networks tin were created for both study times hancock et

values in ndwi layers the initial water body in the study area has been extracted xu and guo 2014 in addition visual drawing and digitizing was used to increase the accuracy of the extracted water body layers field survey and gps measuring data also were used to produce more accurate active channel digital layers also in present study the area of island bars was measured using the ndwi and field survey by gps layers using the fluvial corridor 10 1 toolbox package in arcgis 10 4 2 with a 10 m interval the active channel width was calculated and the active channel width changes were detected in the studied meander loop mirzaee et al 2018 roux et al 2015 by comparing the two active channel layers before and after the flood the eroded area was assessed in arcgis 10 4 the eroded areas are part of the river corridor which has been added to channel body by removing river banks materials during soil erosion process caused by flood power the digital elevation layer dem and triangular irregular networks tin were created using the 8892 depth measure points for before and after a flood using arcgis 10 4 after that the center line slope layer and mean depth of the talweg were detected for two study dates using fluvial corridor 10 1 the amount of sedimentation was taken in account using geomorphic change detection software wheaton et al 2010 milan et al 2011 in places where the depth of river decreased we assumed that the sedimentation process happened on other side in places where the depth of river increased the erosion process occurred then the dem layer was used to obtain and detect the volume and area of sedimentation bank erosion and incision processes along the study meander loop using geomorphic change detection add in version 7 in arcgis 10 4 the value of changes in dem layers that happened in eroded areas which have been detected by comparing two active channel layers have been taken in account as the bank erosion volume in addition the volume of incision was calculated by comparing the dem layers in stable water body areas for before and after a flood event fig 3 shows the flow chart of methodology used in the present study 3 results based on the active channel extracted from the field survey data and the ndwi layers and available oli data fig 4 we derived that the surface area of the active channel increased from 2 442 100 m2 to 3 511 700 m2 for before 08 apr 2016 and after 24 apr 2016 the flood respectively also we found that based on the produced dem layers the flood event decreased the average active channel depth from 2 8 m to 2 1 m along the study meander loop fig 5 the active channel width on average increased about 21 m along the study meander loop after the flood event fig 6 based on the results of morphological change detection during the studied flood there is an elevation rising in 50 1 of active channel and 49 2 of elevation lowering in addition 0 7 of active channel dos not changed during the flood fig 7 a the volume error and surface error of geomorphic change detections are 23 15 m3 and 0 2 m respectively in addition the minimum level of detection min lod for present study was 0 2 m in gcd process bank erosion is one of the most important geomorphological processes resulting from extreme floods based on the comparing two channel layers by arc gis 10 4 2 the results show that 107 ha of marginal lands around the study meander loop were eroded and now are parts of the active channel the volume of bank erosion caused by the extreme flood on 14 04 2016 was approximately 451 000 m3 in addition based on the gcd software the total area of surface lowering and the total area of surface rising are 981267 1 m2 and 971827 1 m2 respectively fig 7 b fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of sedimentation and incision a and elevation change b in active channel area caused by the extreme flood on 14 04 2016 results show based on gcd method the total volume of surface lowering and the total volume of surface rising are 95421 6 m3 and 98619 0 m3 respectively the total area of interest in gcd was 1953094 1 m2 the talweg analysis shows that the mentioned extreme flood event increased the slope of the talweg in the meander loop from 0 000073 08 04 2016 to 0 00029 24 04 2016 and the depth mean in the talweg decreased from 3 7 m to 3 1 m for before and after the flood respectively fig 9 show the talweg depth change caused by studied flood table 1 shows the morphometric parameters for before and after the flood in the studied meander loop 4 discussion the recorded discharge of the investigated flood event on 14 04 2016 in the karoon river shows that it was almost two times bigger than the calculated 100 year recurrence interval regards to the flood classification by dong et al 2007 the recorded flood on 14 04 2016 can be identified as an extreme flood the study area is a single meander loop in the karoon river which is placed to the south of the city of ahvaz historically floodplains have been occupied by human activities agriculture and civilization especially in the last century zaimes et al 2004 kondolf et al 2007 lorenz and feld 2013 votsis 2014 yousefi et al 2015 the karoon river floodplain area is a very important area for agriculture and civilization activities in iran woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2016 the study meander loop is located in an urban district of the ahvaz city which have experienced the flood events yearly results of the current study indicate that the studied meander loop endured a large morphological change in all three dimensions as a result the active channel area has increased about 43 from bank erosion with a total volume loss of about 451 000 m3 which are almost entirely occupied by agriculture and riparian lands as a consequence the active channel width in the studied meander loop increased by 17 7 in addition based on gcd method the total volume of surface lowering and the total volume of surface rising and total net differences are 95421 6 m3 98619 0 m3 and 3197 4 m3 respectively the bank erosion is the main type of erosion on meandering rivers evolution lazarus and constantine 2013 yousefi et al 2018b spitz et al 2001 bank erosion could have serious causes on human property and losses during flood events the results of this study are in agreement with the findings of hauer and habersack 2009 righini et al 2017 and yousefi et al 2018a 2018b who reported that extreme floods have a significant effect on increasing of the active channel width and bank erosion process based on the field visits after study flood event in the karoon river the bank erosion was happened mainly by river banks collapse according to the study results of yousefi et al 2018a 2018b in karoon river geomorphological evolution during study period 1989 2008 indicate a decreasing trend in active channel the results of present study show that in studied meander loop the extreme flood play an opposite role in compare with long term evolution of the karoon river it is accepted confirmed theory that river bank erosion almost happened during flood events larger than the average daily discharge de rose and basher 2011 posner and duan 2012 das et al 2014 dépret et al 2015 reported that raising the frequency of flood events raised the bank erosion and main channel shifting the areas of island bars were decreased due to the extreme flood deposition and incision processes are dependent on the power of flow by increasing the water discharge the kinetic energy of the water increases and the potential for the water to erode sediment in its channels and banks increases as well cenderelli and wohl 2003 hooke 2013 kasvi et al 2017 the results of our study show that the area of island bars decreased and the channel has incised resulting in 8 7 more eroded areas than deposition areas in the active channel area in the single meander loop the amount of sediment incised eroded on the bed was found to be approximately 10 000 m3 more than was deposited this means that as a consequence of the extreme flood the flow energy caused 8 7 of the eroded channel materials to move to the downstream parts of the karoon river where these deposits may cause problems with infrastructure or water availability in the river and downstream area low energy discharges of a river almost have important role on deposition and sedimentation process dépret et al 2015 yousefi et al 2018a mainly the island bars appear during the low energy discharges and shape and change with high energy discharges during flood events elina et al 2013 woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2018a the main island bar is located in the northwestern part of the study meander loop fig 4 this island is covered by vegetation cover and has an oval shaped and developed during the history of the karoon river according to the figs 6 and 8 more than 80 of bank erosion happen in distance from upstream in 0 8000 m and just 20 occurred in distance from upstream 8 000 m to 14 000 m field visits show that the abandoned no vegetated sediment bars are almost located at the distance from 0 to 8 000 m and riparian and agricultural vegetation cover channel banks in distance from 8000 m to 14 000 m fig 9 show that the main incision and deposition in talweg depth happened in distance 8000 m 1000 m and 12 000 m 14 000 m from upstream respectively extreme and flash floods have high level of energy and the river evolution is almost controlled by this kind of floods hooke 2016a reported that the extreme floods have very important role on deposition and erosion process of the rivers in semiarid regions during the extreme flood events bank erosion and channel migration process will straighten the fluvial corridors by meander cutoffs hooke 2004 elina et al 2013 toone et al 2014 rhoads et al 2016 based on the more concentrations of human property and life in urban areas the losses and damages of flood will be more alayande and ogunwamba 2010 gregory 2006 yousefi et al 2018b the results of the present study fig 8 b show that the highest rate of incision process 0 25 m happened on concave sides of the study meander loop in other hand the highest rate of deposition 0 13 m were observed in convex side and near to the island bars the northern parts concave side of the study meander loop are covered with residential district the concave sides of the rivers endure more flow energy and erosion bank collapse and bank erosion das et al 2014 hooke 2013 phillips 2002 so that it is very important to consider flood and sediment controlling actions in urban areas geomorphic change detection gcd is a useful approach to identify the hot spot and changes along the river bodies the main limitation of this method is access to accurate bathymetry data or elevation layers in addition the bathymetry and field measurements were the main and the most challenging part of present study for before and after flood event so that it is suggested to develop and install the automatic bathymetry recording systems for at least important reaches of the rivers especially in urban rivers because of the complexity in meandering river morphology dynamics major geomorphic change predictions during extreme floods are very challenging buraas et al 2014 surian et al 2016 5 conclusions in most situations rivers develop the bank full morphology during low flow and normal ranges of discharge however large and extreme floods are the most important determining factors for floodplain geomorphological evolution in the karoon river which is the largest river in iran in terms of discharge an extreme flood event on 14th of april 2016 occurred with a recurrence interval of more than a 100 year using bathymetry data from before 08 04 2016 and after the flood 24 04 2016 the biggest meander loop in the karoon river which is located next to ahvaz city was investigated in three dimensions our findings show that the studied flood event significantly changed the main channel width and as a consequence a large amount of river sediment was displaced through bank erosion approximately 450 000 m3 in addition the incision value of the study meander loop was found to be 8 4 more than the deposition based on the field visits and oli images the studied flood event covered the whole river body and floodplains but the sinuosity index was not endured a significant change totally the finding of present study show that about 461 000 m3 of sediment moved downstream of the studied meander loop in addition the average channel depth and slope decreased and increased about 25 and 297 respectively results of this study could be helpful to better understand the effects of extreme flood events for river managers and landscape decision makers in addition preparing the appropriate satellite images for exactly before and after extreme floods was the main limitation of the presents study however the bathymetric measurements in a river with center island bars was also challenging in present study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

4657,flooding and flood inundation are key hydrological characteristics of meander loop rivers however the effects of extreme floods on river morphology and spatial patterns of erosion and deposition are poorly understood a detailed geomorphologic change detection and sediment erosion process caused by an extreme flood more than 100 year recurrence interval discharge on 14 apr 2016 was surveyed for a single urban meander loop of the karoon river iran the studied meander loop is located next to the city of the ahavz and has a centerline length of about 14 km the bathymetry in 8892 stable points was measured also the detailed bathymetry layers for before 8 apr 2016 and after 24 apr 2016 the extreme flood event were compared geomorphological change detection gcd results show that in the studied reach about 106 ha of bank erosion was detected with a total volume of approximately 450 600 m3 furthermore total volume of surface lowering and the total volume of surface rising volumes that were obtained were 95421 6 m3 and 98619 0 m3 respectively the talweg length of the studied meander loop decreased about 126 m and the average depth decreased from 3 71 m to 3 14 m after the flood event channel widening as a consequence of the extreme flood was found to be about 21 m 17 the findings of this study indicate that extreme floods play an important role in the sediment budget and

major rivers of the world gregory 2006 rhoads et al 2016 as rivers and floodplains are important for human life in general and especially for agricultural and urban development herold et al 2005 gordon and meentemeyer 2006a price and leigh 2006 vadnais et al 2012 overeem et al 2013 there are various classifications for flood events including catastrophic floods flash floods extreme floods and large floods dong et al 2007 hooke 2016a 2015 flash floods within some hours to days rise and fall rapidly and are depending on the size of the river system usually borga et al 2008 this flood events have high discharge velocities and a high range of energy within the channel and over the floodplain borga et al 2008 hooke 2016a hand et al 2004 mentioned that flash floods are the most extreme hydrological events that have happened during the last four decades in united kingdom at watershed scale different types of floods may occur in the channel and floodplain corridor in response to an extreme rainfall event extreme large and flash floods these hydrologic events and especially the extreme floods have a very important role in fluvial geomorphology evolution poole 2002 borga et al 2007 hall et al 2014 dong et al 2016 sanjuán et al 2016 significant morphological changes in river corridors over short timescales are either due to human interventions including reservoir dams sediment extraction from rivers and land cover change or natural factors including intensive floods volcanic activities and geological activities kondolf et al 2007 hooke 2016a righini et al 2017 yousefi et al 2017 morphological changes can also occur over longer periods of time due to land use changes in the catchment area incision and channel narrowing due to reforestation keesstra et al 2005 gordon and meentemeyer 2006b yousefi et al 2017 or channel widening and aggradation due to deforestation kondolf et al 2007 mirzaee et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018b gordon and meentemeyer 2006b for abrupt changes due to flood events it is important to classify the flood types along a fluvial system the flash and extreme floods can have significant effects on permanent geomorphological changes

river widening and many other geomorphological changes including channel migration deposition and floodplain scouring hajdukiewicz et al 2016 investigated the impact of a large flood on the mountainous fluvial system river dynamic and valley infrastructure in the biała river in the polish carpathians they found that floods with a recurrence interval larger than 80 years cause significant channel widening and incision in fluvial systems elina et al 2013 studied the effects of a flood event on spatio temporal change of fluvial morphology in meandering point bars they found that the variation in river discharge control the transverse shifting and as a consequence has an important impact on the point bar changes also erosion mainly takes place during high flow discharges semi arid ecosystems commonly have more extreme floods than other types of climates farquharson et al 1992 osterkamp and friedman 2000 alexandrov et al 2007 hooke 2016b studied morphological changes due to flow events in a spanish semi arid region where the climatic situation is similar to iran therefore the effects of an extreme flood may be expected to be similar results of the mentioned study showed that channel morphology did not transform with low flow discharges that move the sediment materials in se spain hooke 2016a investigated the geomorphological changes of a fluvial system by an extreme flood and the results showed the extreme flood have major impacts by deposition of flat bars in a braided reach masselink et al 2017 mentioned that in regions with semi arid climate intensive hydrological events move more sediment to the stream network while the smaller events transfer the sediment materials out of the stream network systems over time ruiz villanueva et al 2018 investigated in a study in the emma river switzerland the impacts of a large flood in a mountain watershed they found that along the emme river an intensive flood with a recurrence interval of 150 years has consequences on wide inundations large over bank deposition and have damages on buildings and infrastructure systems the present study is a follow up from the previous study by yousefi et al 2018a and mirzaee et al 2018 in which in the karoon river iran they have investigated the effects of an extreme flood on river morphology in the previous study they have focused on a 155 km long reach of the karoon river using landsat data they studied the relationship between different riverside land use types and the morphological changes that found after the large flood event in this study a new data source was used an accurate bathymetry that enables the analysis of sedimentation deposition and incision erosion values at that moment which is a bridge to better understanding of effects of extreme flood on meander river geomorphology the aim of this study is to further quantify the morphological change to understand the sedimentation and erosion processes in the largest urban meandering loop of karoon

was found to be approximately 10 000 m3 more than was deposited this means that as a consequence of the extreme flood the flow energy caused 8 7 of the eroded channel materials to move to the downstream parts of the karoon river where these deposits may cause problems with infrastructure or water availability in the river and downstream area low energy discharges of a river almost have important role on deposition and sedimentation process dépret et al 2015 yousefi et al 2018a mainly the island bars appear during the low energy discharges and shape and change with high energy discharges during flood events elina et al 2013 woodbridge et al 2016 yousefi et al 2018a the main island bar is located in the northwestern part of the study meander loop fig 4 this island is covered by vegetation cover and has an oval shaped and developed during the history of the karoon river according to the figs 6 and 8 more than 80 of bank erosion happen in distance from upstream in 0 8000 m and just 20 occurred in distance from upstream 8 000 m to 14 000 m field visits show that the abandoned no vegetated sediment bars are almost located at the distance from 0 to 8 000 m and riparian and agricultural vegetation cover channel banks in distance from 8000 m to 14 000 m fig 9 show that the main incision and deposition in talweg depth happened in distance 8000 m 1000 m and 12 000 m 14 000 m from upstream respectively extreme and flash floods have high level of energy and the river evolution is almost controlled by this kind of floods hooke 2016a reported that the extreme floods have very important role on deposition and erosion process of the rivers in semiarid regions during the extreme flood events bank erosion and channel migration process will straighten the fluvial corridors by meander cutoffs hooke 2004 elina et al 2013 toone et al 2014 rhoads et al 2016 based on the more concentrations of human property and life in urban areas the losses and damages of flood will be more alayande and ogunwamba 2010 gregory 2006 yousefi et al 2018b the results of the present study fig 8 b show that the highest rate of incision process 0 25 m happened on concave sides of the study meander loop in other hand the highest rate of deposition 0 13 m were observed in convex side and near to the island bars the northern parts concave side of the study meander loop are covered with residential district the concave sides of the rivers endure more flow energy and erosion bank collapse and bank erosion das et al 2014 hooke 2013 phillips 2002 so that it is very important to consider flood and sediment controlling actions in urban areas geomorphic change detection gcd is a useful approach to identify the hot spot and changes along the river bodies the main limitation of this method is access to accurate bathymetry data or elevation layers in addition the bathymetry and field measurements were the main and the most challenging part of present study for before and after flood event so that it is suggested to develop and install the automatic bathymetry recording systems for at least important reaches of the rivers especially in urban rivers because of the complexity in meandering river morphology dynamics major geomorphic change predictions during extreme floods are very challenging buraas et al 2014 surian et al 2016 5 conclusions in most situations rivers develop the bank full morphology during low flow and normal ranges of discharge however large and extreme floods are the most important determining factors for floodplain geomorphological evolution in the karoon river which is the largest river in iran in terms of discharge an extreme flood event on 14th of april 2016 occurred with a recurrence interval of more than a 100 year using bathymetry data from before 08 04 2016 and after the flood 24 04 2016 the biggest meander loop in the karoon river which is located next to ahvaz city was investigated in three dimensions our findings show that the studied flood event significantly changed the main channel width and as a consequence a large amount of river sediment was displaced through bank erosion approximately 450 000 m3 in addition the incision value of the study meander loop was found to be 8 4 more than the deposition based on the field visits and oli images the studied flood event covered the whole river body and floodplains but the sinuosity index was not endured a significant change totally the finding of present study show that about 461 000 m3 of sediment moved downstream of the studied meander loop in addition the average channel depth and slope decreased and increased about 25 and 297 respectively results of this study could be helpful to better understand the effects of extreme flood events for river managers and landscape decision makers in addition preparing the appropriate satellite images for exactly before and after extreme floods was the main limitation of the presents study however the bathymetric measurements in a river with center island bars was also challenging in present study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

4658,the cotransport of heavy metals hms i e pb2 and cd2 and sio2 suspended particles sps in a porous medium quartz sand at different temperatures was investigated by one dimensional laboratory column experiments considering the significant differences in particle size and dielectric property between hms and sps a theoretical model describing their cotransport was developed in this study the results show that temperature and darcy velocity have a negligible effect on the transport of individual hms and that the recovery ratio of cd2 is higher than that of pb2 which can be attributed to the lower adsorption of cd2 on the solid matrix the presence of sps can facilitate the transport of hms due to the strong adsorption of positively charged hms on negatively charged sps however this effect tends to decrease with the size of the sio2 particles an increase in temperature e g t 20 60 c results in a decrease in the recovery ratio of hms because more hms adsorbed on sps can be deposited at high temperatures the adsorption of hms on sps can also change the dielectric properties of the sps thus causing a reduction in the repulsion between the sps and the solid matrix and a consequent decrease in the recovery ratio of sps in addition the results show that the developed model fits well with the experimental results keywords sio2 particle heavy metal temperature cotransport theoretical model 1 introduction the transport of heavy metals hms in groundwater and the resulting interactions between hms and the soil medium are vital topics in environmental geotechnology arab et al 2014 tansel and rafiuddin 2016 bai et al 2020 hms e g pb2 and cd2 in the soil medium are characterized by high mobility and chemical activity hudcová et al 2018 kamrani et al 2018 moreover the presence of mobile solid particles in the soil medium such as bacteria colloids and other suspended particles sps e g silicon powders may supply potential vehicles for the transport of hms cui et al 2018 thereby inducing an increase in the migration rate of these hms pang et al 2005 sun et al 2010 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2016 therefore a better grasp of the cotransport of hms and sps is imperative for the restoration of polluted soil layers karathanasis 1999 indicated that the presence of colloidal particles typically accelerated metal transport by 5 to 50 fold over that of the control treatment with zn2 being consistently more mobile than cu2 zhu et al 2014 found that a reduction in ionic strength and flow interruption could enhance colloid facilitated hg transport in contaminated soils in column experiments malkovsky et al 2015 showed colloid facilitated migration of radioactive uranium u by seepage groundwater from an underground source at the ore field to the earth s surface in eastern transbaikalia several cotransport models for colloid facilitated contaminant transport have been proposed valsala and govindarajan 2019 bekhit et al 2009 proposed a theoretical model to account for the transport mechanisms of contaminants reaction kinetics and different physicochemical and biological processes in the presence of colloids and bacteria in groundwater which was verified against experimental data for cd2 transport in the absence and presence of e coli vegetative cells katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 developed a conceptual model that describes the cotransport of viruses and colloids in a saturated porous medium with uniform flow which could account for the transport of individual viruses and colloids as well as viruses attached onto colloids borazjani and bedrikovetsky 2017 revealed multiple mechanisms for the capture of sps and derived analytical solutions for a two phase flow it is known that the cotransport of hms and sps critically depends on their charge characteristics positively charged hms can be adsorbed onto the surface of negatively charged sps e g sio2 particles at the same time the small sized sps e g silicon powders can accelerate the migration of hms because of the size exclusion effect ahfir et al 2017 bennacer et al 2017 chen et al 2018 russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 bai et al 2019 and yet sps with a size larger than the soil pore dimension can be entrapped in pore constrictions hence inhibiting the transport of hms in addition charged sps are likely to be adsorbed onto the surface of an oppositely charged solid matrix resulting in inhibition of the transport of sps thus repulsion between charges can greatly facilitate the transport of sps the interaction mechanisms of different hms with the porous medium and their migration processes can differ completely zhu et al 2014 agbozu and bassey 2016 hudcová et al 2018 wu and li 1998 simulated the transport of four hms cd2 pb2 cu2 and zn2 in a hypothetical sand bentonite clay column and the results showed that their mobility followed the order cu2 zn2 pb2 cd2 in neutral ph 7 leachate but cd2 zn2 cu2 pb2 in more acidic leachate naidu et al 1994 investigated the effects of ph ph range of 3 8 and the ionic strength of ca2 and na in two oxisols mena and malanda on the adsorption of cd2 the results showed that for all soils the adsorption of cd2 increased with increasing ph value moreover most of the discrepancy in adsorption could be interpreted by the differences in negative surface charges although the influence of ionic strength on the adsorption of cd2 changed substantially depending on the soil and ph tang et al 2013 showed that soluble organic matter in water e g carbon could contend for sorption sites or form soluble complexes with hms thereby reducing the adsorption of hms by the soil medium to accelerate the migration of hms kumpiene 2015 discussed the biochemical activity hm availability microbial functional diversity and soil toxicity of cd2 pb2 and zn2 contaminated soils to recover their ecological environments besides ma et al 2016 stated clearly that the transport of colloidal particles accelerated as v migration by blocking the adsorption of as v onto sand although soil colloids had low adsorption capacity for as v in general a larger relative specific surface area of fine particles in the soil medium corresponds to a greater adsorption of toxic contaminants tang et al 2013 agbozu and bassey 2016 the existence of sps can accelerate or inhibit the transport of hms attributing to the interactions of hms or sps with the porous medium and physical chemical changes in seepage flow such as the sp dimensions solution ph ionic concentration critical salt concentration van der waals force and double layer repulsive force bedrikovetsky et al 2012 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 valsala and govindarajan 2019 however despite the recognized importance of temperature in the transport of contaminants bradford et al 2009 garcía garcía et al 2009 kim and walker 2009 arab et al 2014 bär et al 2015 the role of temperature in the cotransport of hms and sps remains to be elucidated in this study the cotransport of hms pb2 and cd2 and sps in a porous medium was investigated in a one dimensional laboratory column experiment under varying temperature darcy velocity sp particle size and hm injection concentration further by distinguishing the variance in particle size and dielectric property a theoretical cotransport model for hms and sps based on the convection diffusion deposition hydrodynamics of particles was proposed and then verified against experimental data 2 experimental 2 1 experimental setup the cylindrical chamber used in the experimental tests is made of plexiglass fig 1 the specimen column is 300 mm in height and 80 mm in diameter with a height to diameter ratio of 3 75 prior to the experiment the cylindrical chamber was filled with quartz sand and maintained in a temperature controlled water bath and the water to be supplied to the chamber was also maintained at the same temperature in a temperature controlled water tank hh420 joyn co shanghai china operating temperature range 0 100 c the temperature could be controlled within 0 2 c the deionized water in the temperature controlled water tank was pumped into the cylindrical chamber at a constant velocity using a peristaltic pump bt600 2j longerpump co baoding china control range 120 1200 ml min the water was injected vertically from the top to the bottom of the chamber which could be assumed to be a one dimensional steady flow mesh screens of 0 5 mm in diameter were placed at both the inlet and outlet of the chamber to ensure a steady flow and prevent the escape of the quartz sand the tested suspension was injected into the chamber using a 60 ml syringe from the top of the column the leachate was collected using a 30 ml special plastic bottle to measure the concentration of hms and sps the concentration of hms was measured using the graphite furnace method tas 990g persee general instrument co beijing china according to the concentration absorbance relationship the turbidity of sps in the leachate was determined using a turbidity meter type 2100 n hach co usa measurement range 0 4000 nephelometric turbidity units ntus and then the concentration of sps was determined based on the concentration turbidity relationship 2 2 porous medium sio2 particles and hms low reactive quartz sand analytically pure main mineral constituent sio2 density 2 65 g cm3 prepared by mechanical crushing of quartzite was utilized as the porous matter the quartz sand had a white lustrous surface with high acid and alkali resistance the particle size ranged from 1 3 5 mm with a median of 2 2 mm and particles of 1 2 mm and 2 0 3 5 mm accounted for approximately 26 and 74 of all particles respectively the curvature coefficient was c c 1 08 and the nonuniformity coefficient was c u 2 11 the impurities on the surface of the quartz sand particles such as aluminum and iron oxides were removed by rinsing with 0 01 mol l naoh and hno3 solutions for 10 min before the experiment and then the quartz sand was washed repeatedly with deionized water until the ph of the water remained constant to guarantee a high saturation degree of the sand column 20 ml of deionized water was first added to the cylindrical chamber and the outlet was adjusted to ensure no bubbles at the bottom then quartz sand was introduced and stirred using a glass rod to compactly pack the sand this step was repeated to ensure the packing of the quartz sand and each time the water level was kept 2 cm above the top of the porous medium the final porosity of the saturated sand column was n 41 67 spherical sio2 particles were prepared by dry grinding of natural quartzite fig 2 fuhong mineral products co shanxi china which had a dry density of 2 2 g cm3 and various excellent properties such as high temperature resistance insolubility in acidic and alkaline solutions and high chemical stability the transport of sps can be affected by their particle size and geometrical morphology molecular diffusion electrostatic force hydrodynamic process and gravity thus sio2 particles with median diameters of d 50 2 8 10 9 and 18 7 μm were used fig 2 because these sizes would not cause severe entrapment of the sps in pore constrictions in the quartz sand column the adsorption property and pattern of hms in the soil medium may differ substantially due to differences in the size and quantity of charges kumpiene 2015 katip et al 2016 thus two typical hms pb2 with an atomic weight of 207 2 and cd2 with an atomic weight of 112 411 were used because of the low solubility of pb2 and its high adsorption on sio2 particles sps can have a more significant effect on the transport of pb2 than the transport of cd2 different concentrations of pb2 solutions were prepared by dissolving analytically pure pb no3 2 powder and sio2 particles in deionized water given that pb2 and cd2 exist mainly as ions in a slightly acidic state the pb2 solution was adjusted to ph 5 5 by adding an appropriate amount of 0 01 mol l naoh or hno3 solution as necessary the cd2 solution could be prepared by diluting a 100 μg ml cd no3 2 solution with deionized water the high coordination capacity of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta disodium salt makes it possible to form stable chelates with almost all metal ions in this experiment 0 05 mol l edta disodium salt was utilized as the extraction reagent which could produce high extraction efficiency 90 for both pb2 and cd2 nedwed and clifford 2000 fangueiro et al 2002 2 3 experimental schemes laboratory experiments were accomplished to discuss the transport of pb2 or cd2 alone and the cotransport of pb2 or cd2 with sps because the pb2 concentration in a geotechnical environment is generally higher in some cases even by several orders of magnitudes than the cd2 concentration agbozu and bassey 2016 tansel and rafiuddin 2016 the concentrations of the pb2 solutions were set to c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml table 1 whereas those of the cd2 solutions were set to c m 100 300 and 500 ng ml in view of the temperature of the discard solution that may be encountered in actual engineering different temperatures are also set herein e g t 20 40 and 60 c the injection concentration of sps was fixed at c inj 2 mg ml the experiment was started 30 min after both the water bath tank and the temperature controlled water tank reached the predetermined temperature to maintain a constant temperature throughout the experiment as a single pulse injection pattern a solution volume of v inj 30 ml pb2 cd2 or sps alone or a mixture of pb2 or cd2 with sps was injected into the sample column over a short period of 2 s leachate with high turbidity was diluted prior to measuring the turbidity of the sps to extract hms adsorbed on the surface of the sps the leachate was shaken for 4 h in a constant temperature oscillator hy 4 changzhou china vibration amplitude 0 20 mm vibration frequency 0 300 rpm to ensure the formation of stable chelates with the extraction reagent edta subsequently the hms and sps were separated using a low speed desktop centrifuge with a maximum rotation speed of 6500 rpm l3 6k hunan co china the supernatant was collected for the measurement of the hm absorbance in addition a repeated pulse injection of hm solutions at concentrations of c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml was also carried out at t 20 c the particle size of the sps was d 50 2 8 μm the injection concentration was c inj 2 mg ml and the flow velocity was v 0 087 cm s the injection time was t inj 1 2 s t inj 2 1 s and t inj 3 1 s the injection rate was 15 ml s and the injection time was t p 1 0 t p 2 240 and t p 3 360 s 3 transport process of pb2 or cd2 pore volume v p is defined as the ratio of the total volume of water flowing through the column to the void volume of the column and it facilitates comparisons of experimental results at different darcy velocities on the same time scale to compare the experimental results obtained at different injection concentrations the relative concentration c r is used to describe the concentration of hms or sps in the leachate 1 c r c v p m where c is the solution concentration of hms or sps in the leachate ml 3 and m is the mass of injected hms m v inj c m or sps m v inj c inj m table 2 displays the peaks of the relative concentrations of pb2 and cd2 at different temperatures v 0 087 cm s fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves btcs of pb2 at different temperatures t 20 40 60 and 80 c injection concentrations c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml and darcy velocities v 0 087 0 173 and 0 260 cm s similar trends can also be observed in the btcs of cd2 table 2 indicates a large difference in the peak c r values of pb2 and cd2 in the leachate which can be attributed to the large difference in concentration between the pb2 and cd2 injection solutions pb2 c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml cd2 c m 100 300 and 500 ng ml and in their adsorption and desorption in the porous medium nevertheless the experimental results show that at the same c m temperature appears to have no effect on the transport of hms in the porous medium for instance the peak c r values of pb2 for t 20 40 and 60 c are very close c r 0 058 0 060 at a darcy velocity of v 0 087 cm s and an injection concentration of c m 100 μg ml whereas for cd2 the same phenomenon can also be observed c r 0 226 0 238 at v 0 087 cm s and c m 100 ng ml however pb2 is more likely to be deposited than cd2 due to its higher adsorption on the negatively charged matrix of the porous medium the main mineral constituent is sio2 which results in a smaller peak c r of pb2 in the leachate fig 3 fig 3 reveals an obvious tailing phenomena at the later stage of the btcs indicating desorption of the adsorbed hms importantly the btcs obtained at v 0 087 0 173 and 0 260 cm s were nearly the same demonstrating that the seepage velocity has a negligible influence on the transport of individual hms under acidic conditions a portion of the hms can be dissolved in water and move with it whereas the remainder of the hms can be adsorbed onto the soil matrix some of these adsorbed hms can be released into the water when the concentration of hms in the solution is low clearly changes in temperature from 20 80 c as examined in this study may have no significant effects on the transport of hms and thus could result in almost identical btcs at different temperatures however as the injection concentration of hms increases the peak c r increases accordingly for instance fig 3 indicates that an increase in the injection concentration of pb2 c m 100 300 500 μg ml at v 0 087 cm s causes an increase in the average peak c r c r 0 060 0 082 0 101 and actual concentration c 0 279 1 146 2 352 μg ml of pb2 obtained at the four temperatures table 2 also reveals that an increase in the injection concentration of cd2 from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml at v 0 087 cm s leads to an increase in the average peak c r from c r 0 233 to c r 0 478 4 cotransport processes of hms and sps 4 1 influences of temperature on the btcs typical experimental results obtained at v 0 087 cm s are shown in table 2 and the btcs of pb2 at an injection concentration of c m 100 μg ml are shown in fig 4 a close comparison of fig 4 a b and c reveals that the darcy velocity has no significant effect on the transport of pb2 in the presence of sio2 particles resulting in almost identical btcs similar tailing phenomena are also observed indicating the desorption of deposited hms fig 4 shows that the peak c r of pb2 in the presence of sio2 particles is higher than that in the absence of sio2 particles fig 3 for instance the peak c r of pb2 in the presence of sio2 particles at d 50 2 8 μm c m 100 μg ml and t 20 c table 2 is 14 8 times that in the absence of sio2 particles indicating that sps can significantly facilitate the transport of pb2 similarly the peak c r of cd2 in the presence of sio2 particles at d 50 2 8 μm c m 100 ng ml and t 20 c table 2 is 2 9 times that in the absence of sio2 particles which is lower than that of pb2 thus the transport of cd2 is less facilitated by sps than that of pb2 which can be attributed to the weak adsorption of cd2 on sio2 particles qiao et al 2017 in general the higher the amount of hms adsorbed on sps the more significant the sp facilitated transport of hms however it is important to note that the presence of sps with a large particle size may inhibit the transport of cd2 at high temperatures and injection concentrations e g d 50 18 7 μm t 60 c c m 500 ng ml table 2 thus the c r of cd2 in the leachate in the presence of sps c r 0 398 is slightly lower than that in the absence of sps c r 0 463 fig 4 shows that the peak c r of hms decreases significantly with increasing temperature which is in accordance with the btcs of sio2 particles fig 5 thus the transport of sps can have significant coupling effects on that of hms due to the adsorption of hms on sps as a consequence the concentration of hms especially pb2 in the leachate critically depends on the concentration of sps in addition the complex physical and chemical interactions among the porous medium matrix hms and sps can significantly delay the transport of sps and increase the deposition coefficient at high temperatures resulting in a low peak c r in the btc from figs 3 and 4 the presence of sps causes an increase in the peak c r of hms and earlier transport of pb2 as indicated by the smaller v p corresponding to the peak c r this phenomenon indicates that sps can facilitate the transport of pb2 it is known that negatively charged sps have a high adsorption capacity for positively charged hms such as pb2 sps can move with water natarajan and kumar 2011 cui et al 2019 and act as a third phase mobile solid phase particle b in fig 6 in addition to the immobile solid phase of the porous medium thus pb2 can be adsorbed on sps in a similar fashion as on the immobile solid matrix and then migrate in the subsurface medium at a rate similar to or even higher than that in the mobile aqueous phase due to the size exclusion effect bai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 fig 5 presents the btcs of sps in the presence or absence of pb2 at c m 100 μg ml and c inj 2 mg ml clearly the peak c r values of sps are decreased in the presence of pb2 compared to the absence of pb2 especially for those sps with a large particle size e g d 50 18 7 μm the adsorption of pb2 on sps can reduce the repulsive force between the sps and the soil matrix by the dlvo theory due to the decrease in the absolute zeta potentials corresponding to their surface charge sugimoto et al 2014 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 ahfir et al 2017 bai et al 2020 inducing an increase in the deposition of sps on the soil matrix therefore the coupling effect of pb2 which is due to the decrease in the double electric layer on the sp surface decrease in surface potential energy cannot be neglected the peak c r values of hms and sps decrease with increasing particle size of the sps figs 4 and 5 obviously sps with a larger particle size are more likely to be entrapped at pore constrictions in the soil matrix inducing an increase in the deposition coefficient of the sps bedrikovetsky et al 2017 bai et al 2019 and a possible delay in the peak concentration altoé et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 accordingly hms adsorbed on sps can also be deposited indicating a strong coupling effect between them for this reason the peak c r of pb2 that can be easily adsorbed on sps decreases with increasing pb2 injection concentration in the range examined c m 100 500 μg ml which is opposite to the transport of pb2 in the absence of sps in fact more pb2 can be adsorbed on sps at a higher pb2 injection concentration which can increase the attraction between the oppositely charged sps and the porous medium matrix as a result sps are more likely to be adsorbed on the matrix leaving fewer sps in the leachate and thus causing a decrease in the pb2 concentration in the leachate however the peak c r of cd2 that shows weak adsorption on sps increases with increasing injection concentration in this case the transport of cd2 by itself is dominant for instance increasing the injection concentration of cd2 from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml at v 0 087 cm s d 50 2 8 μm and t 20 c results in an increase in the peak c r from c r 0 667 to c r 1 070 table 2 a comparison between figs 4 and 5 reveals that the peak c r of the sps appears earlier than that of the hms indicating accelerated transport of the sps due to the size exclusion effect fig 5 also shows that an increase in temperature would further exacerbate the irregular movement of sps in the porous medium and even reduce the migration velocity of hms and sps fig 4 4 2 recovery ratio of hms and sps the recovery ratio of an individual contaminant e g hms or sps alone can be calculated by integrating the area of simulated btcs katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 ahfir et al 2017 2 r e 0 q c t d t m where r e is the recovery ratio t is the time t q va is the flow rate l3t 1 v is the darcy velocity lt 1 and a is the cross sectional area of the column l2 figs 7 and 8 show the recovery ratios of hms c m 100 and 500 μg ml for pb2 and c m 100 and 500 ng ml for cd2 and sps respectively which are plotted as a function of the particle size at different temperatures using mathematica 9 by wolfram research r 2 0 95 except for some curves for the transport of only pb2 i e d 50 0 r e 3 26 3 43 when c m 100 μg ml and r e 5 19 4 98 when c m 500 μg ml fig 7 thus indicating a low recovery ratio 5 of pb2 however a portion of the hms adsorbed on sps can move with the sps resulting in an increase in the recovery ratio of the hms for instance at d 50 2 8 μm and c inj 2 mg ml the recovery ratio is r e 42 09 44 17 when c m 100 μg ml and r e 31 39 31 41 when c m 500 μg ml which are 6 10 times higher than the ratios for the transport of pb2 in the absence of sps for the transport of only cd2 i e d 50 0 r e 15 52 16 74 when c m 100 ng ml and r e 25 59 31 60 when c m 500 ng ml the presence of sps can also result in a significant increase in the recovery ratio of cd2 for instance at d 50 2 8 μm and c inj 2 mg ml for sps the recovery ratio of cd2 is r e 46 94 55 12 when c m 100 ng ml and r e 63 74 75 97 when c m 500 ng ml which are 2 3 times higher than those for the transport of only cd2 clearly the recovery ratio of cd2 is much higher than that of pb2 fig 7 indicates that the recovery ratios of both pb2 and cd2 without the existence of sps increase with increasing injection concentration of hms for instance the increase of pb2 injection concentration from c m 100 μg ml to c m 500 μg ml at t 20 c results in an increase in the recovery ratio from r e 3 26 3 43 to r e 4 98 5 19 whereas the increase in cd2 injection concentration from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml results in an increase in the recovery ratio from r e 15 52 16 74 to r e 23 98 31 60 relative to the changes in the peak concentration in the btcs table 2 an opposite trend is observed for pb2 in the presence of sps see the downward arrows in fig 7 for instance the increase in pb2 injection concentration from c m 100 μg ml to c m 500 μg ml at d 50 2 8 μm and t 20 c results in a decrease in the recovery ratio from r e 42 09 44 17 to r e 31 39 31 41 however the recovery ratio of cd2 increases with increasing injection concentration see the upward arrows in fig 7 for instance increasing the cd2 injection concentration from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml at d 50 2 8 μm and t 20 c causes an increase in the recovery ratio from r e 49 64 55 12 to r e 63 74 75 97 in fact most pb2 can still be adsorbed on the solid matrix and sps and then deposited even at a high injection concentration due to the strong interactions between pb2 and the matrix and sps leaving less pb2 to be taken away by water or sps by contrast cd2 is more likely to be dissolved in water rather than adsorbed on the solid matrix and sps at a high injection concentration due to the weak interactions between cd2 and the matrix and sps resulting in a higher recovery ratio the recovery ratio of pb2 decreases slightly as the particle size of the sps increases d 50 2 8 10 9 18 7 μm indicating that sps with a larger particle size are less able to facilitate the transport of pb2 which can be attributed to the large deposition of hms however compared with the recovery ratio of pb2 the recovery ratio of cd2 shows a more marked decrease with increasing particle size of the sps as an example when c m 500 ng ml and v 0 260 cm s the recovery ratio of cd2 is r e 64 65 54 38 and 31 53 at d 50 2 8 10 9 and 18 7 μm respectively it is also noted that as the particle size of the sps increases to d 50 18 7 μm the recovery ratios of pb2 and cd2 tend to be similar and the deposition effect of the sps becomes more pronounced fig 8 fig 7 indicates that the recovery ratio of hms tends to decrease as the temperature increases t 20 40 60 c at a high temperature e g t 60 c fig 7 c the differences in the effects of the injection concentration and darcy velocity on the recovery ratios of pb2 and cd2 become less pronounced in this case temperature is the dominant factor affecting the recovery ratio of hms which can be attributed to the high deposition of sps fig 8 c at this point sps would collide more frequently and violently with other sps or the solid matrix and their motion trajectory would become more complex accordingly hms adsorbed on sps also move in a complex manner and most of these hm ions are deposited in the pores of the porous medium see process 2 in fig 6 the adsorption of hms on sps can change the dielectric properties of the surface of sps thus causing a reduction in the repulsion between the sps and the solid matrix thus the presence of hms can inhibit the transport of sps however it is important to note that this inhibitory effect increases with increasing the injection concentration of hms see the comparison between the hollow and green dot curves in fig 8 thus the coupling effect of hms on the transport of sps should be taken into account in the cotransport model fig 8 also shows that the recovery ratio of sps decreases with increasing particle size of the sps which is in line with previous findings bennacer et al 2013 ahfir et al 2017 bai et al 2019 5 cotransport model of hms and sps 5 1 governing equations the convection dispersion deposition model is often used to describe the transport of an individual contaminant such as hms viruses and solid particles wang et al 2012 bedrikovetsky et al 2017 russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 as well as the cotransport of multiphase sps bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 in this study the cotransport of hms and sps fig 6 involves the following three pathways some hms or sps are deposited on the porous medium matrix and some are dissolved or suspended in water and move with it while other hms are adsorbed on sps and then move with water or are deposited on the solid matrix the adsorption deposition of hms or sps is also affected by the desorption release of existing deposited matter processes 1 4 in fig 6 thus the cotransport of hms and sps involves the transport of three species of matter hms sps and sps coupled with hms denoted by mps for the cotransport of two species of matter with a similar particle size their coupling effect on each other is equivalent however for the transport of two species of matter with large differences in particle size and dielectric properties the coupling effect of one species of matter on the transport of the other species of matter may be neglected whereas the opposite effect must be considered for instance for the cotransport of hms and sps some hm ions migrate individually whereas others are absorbed on the surface of sps and move with the sps fig 6 for this process a new theoretical cotransport model for hms and sps is proposed by distinguishing the variance in particle size and dielectric property given the large coupling effect of constituent j e g sps on constituent i e g hms the transport process of constituent i is governed by the convection dispersion equation bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 3 t c i z t ρ s n σ i z t d i 2

absorbed on constituent j deposited on the solid matrix mm 1 n is the porosity of the porous medium ρ s is the density of the solid matrix ml 3 di and dij are the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients of species i and coupled species of i and j l2t 1 respectively and ui is the average interstitial velocity of species i lt 1 the dispersivity of each species is defined as α d i di u 0 and α d ij dij u 0 where u 0 is the average interstitial fluid velocity u 0 v n in eq 3 the transport processes of individual constituent i and those of constituent i absorbed on constituent j are described by the first and second terms on the left side of the equation respectively while the movement of constituent i with water and that of constituent i absorbed on constituent j are described on the right side at cij z t 0 and σij z t 0 eq 3 can be used to describe the transport of constituent i with no coupling with constituent j for the transport of sps with a much larger mass than the hms the mass coupling effect of hms can be neglected however the strong electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged hms and sps sio2 particles makes it easy for hms to be adsorbed on sps in this case the transport of sps coupled with hms i e mps is dominant fig 6 particles a and b i e the transport of individual sps particles c and d can be neglected as a result the transport equation of sps can be greatly simplified and can be assumed to be the same as that for the transport of individual sps the adsorption of hms on sps may cause changes in the dielectric properties of the surface of the sps and corresponding changes in the migration velocity dispersion coefficient and deposition coefficient of the sps as the mass of hms is negligibly smaller than that of sps the mass of sps coupled with hms should show no discernible change changes in the density ρ s and porosity n of the porous medium are also not considered in the cotransport of hms and sps thus the transport of sps coupled with hms i e mps can be derived from eq 3 4 c j z t t ρ s n σ j z t t d ij 2 c j z t z 2 u ij c j z t z where uij is the transport velocity of mps substituting the subscript ij with j yields the hydrodynamic equation for the transport of sps in the absence of hms as described in eq 4 at this point dj and α d j dj u 0 are the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and dispersivity for the transport of sps in the absence of hms respectively and uj is the average interstitial velocity of sps alone the release of adsorbed hms or mps can have a significant effect on the deposition kinetics for a variable concentration injection the equation accounting for the release of hms process 1 in fig 6 or mps process 2 in fig 6 from the solid matrix can be derived by a linear kinetic approach ahfir et al 2017 bennacer et al 2013 5 ρ s n σ i z t t k d i c i z t k r i ρ s n σ i z t where k d i and k r i are the deposition coefficient and release coefficient of hms or mps when the subscript i is replaced by j respectively t 1 studies have focused on the mathematical modeling of the cotransport of multiphase particles bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 clearly there is a complex coupling effect between mobile and immobile particles fig 5 a particles a and b and between particles and the solid matrix in the transport of multiphaseflowcontainingsolid particles overall the adsorption of hms on sps deposited on the matrix is closely related to the concentration of mps in the aqueous solution thus considering the release effect the concentration of hms absorbed onto sps already attached onto the solid matrix can be described as follows process 2 in fig 6 6 t σ j z t σ ij z t k d j i j c j z t c ij z t k r j i j ρ s n σ j z t σ ij z t where k d j ij and k r j ij are the deposition coefficient and release coefficient between mps and the solid matrix respectively t 1 hms adsorbed on sps can be released into the aqueous solution due to hydrodynamic action particle capture and detachment in porous media are closely related to the seepage velocity particle size and even the maximum retention concentration bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 for the attachment detachment process between two suspended substances it is simply assumed that the linear action process is satisfied thus the concentration of hms adsorbed on sps in the aqueous phase can be described as follows process 3 in fig 6 7 σ ij z t t k d i j c ij z t k r i j σ ij z t where k d ij and k r ij are the adsorption coefficient and release coefficient between hms and sps in the aqueous phase respectively t 1 5 2 determination of transport parameters the hydrodynamic parameters involved in the cotransport of hms and sps such as migration velocity dispersion coefficient deposition coefficient and release coefficient are determined based on the experimental results the proposed transport equations can be used to fit the btcs obtained by the pulse experiments in sections 4 and 5 accurately fitting more than three transport parameters simultaneously is always difficult and to obtain unique results the number of parameters to be fitted should be minimized the parameters are determined as follows i the migration velocity ui hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient di di α d i u 0 deposition coefficient k d i and release coefficient k r i of hms i hms can be obtained from eqs 3 and 5 based on the btcs for the transport of individual hms however cij z t 0 and σij z t 0 in eq 3 due to the absence of sps for simplicity it is assumed that k r i 0 1k d i bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 because compared with the deposition coefficient k d i the release coefficient k r i is usually very small ii as sps are always coupled with hms during cotransport no sps alone are present for sps coupled with hms i e mps their transport parameters differ substantially from those of sps alone due to the charges of the hms adsorbed on the sps at this point the migration velocity uij hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dij dij α d ij u 0 deposition coefficient k d j and release coefficient k r j of mps can be obtained from eqs 4 and 5 based on the btcs of sps for the cotransport of hms and sps similarly it is also assumed that k r j 0 1k d j leaving only three parameters to be fitted among these parameters for simplicity the dispersion coefficient and migration velocity of mps can be assumed to be similar to those of sps alone thus dij dj and uij uj eq 4 however the experimental results show a large difference in deposition coefficient between mps and sps alone due to the charge of the hms absorbed on the sps iii in eq 6 as the deposition and release of hms adsorbed on sps depend on the deposition and release of mps it is simply assumed that k d j ij k d j and k r j ij 0 1k d j ij in addition the adsorption coefficient k d ij and desorption coefficient k r ij between hms and sps ij mp can be determined based on isothermal adsorption and desorption experiments however as the ratio of the two parameters is generally small they can be assumed to be proportional e g k r ij 0 1k d ij 5 3 solutions and verification initially the assumption is that particles are not adsorbed on the solid matrix and the mixed solutions of hms and sps are injected from the top of the column the initial and boundary conditions are set as follows ci z 0 0 σi z 0 0 and ci 0 0 i hms sps mp for the instantaneous injection the concentration of each species applied on the top surface of the column is as follows 8 c i 0 t m v inj q t inj 1 h t t inj where h t is the heaviside step function and t inj is the injection time t the perturbation caused by the instantaneous injection of a suspension e g v inj 30 ml and t inj 2 s at a small darcy velocity e g v 0 087 cm s is likely to change the seepage velocity of the flow in the sand column therefore we assume that u 0 t vat inj v inj nat inj u 0 v inj nat inj during the injection time t inj thus the actual seepage velocity in the porous medium during the injection is revised as follows 9 u 0 t u 0 v inj n a t inj 1 h t t inj eq 9 shows that u 0 t u 0 when t t inj and that u 0 t u 0 when t t inj the transport parameters can be fitted using origin 8 5 originlab corporation based on the experimental results as an example table 3 shows the values of parameters obtained at a darcy velocity v 0 087 cm s and temperatures of t 20 40 and 60 c for a pb2 solution with a concentration of c m 100 μg ml and a cd2 solution with a concentration of c m 100 ng ml r 2 0 96 table 3 also displays the adsorption and desorption coefficients of the hms and sps where k d j ij k d j and k r j ij 0 1k d j ij six unknown parameters must be determined ci z t cj z t σi z t σj z t cij z t and σij z t specifically cj z t and σj z t of the sps are determined by eqs 4 and 5 cij z t and σij z t are determined by eqs 6 and 7 and ci z t and σi z t are approximated by eqs 3 and 5 respectively the iteration is repeated until the required accuracy is reached the cotransport processes of hms and sps can be simulated using the pardiso solver in comsol numerical software comsol co the fitting parameters are shown in table 3 and the controlling parameters are shown in table 4 fig 9 shows the experimental and simulated btcs for the cotransport of pb2 and sps when d 50 2 8 μm and v 0 087 cm s in the case of single pulse injection the simulated results also revealed that the peak concentrations of hms decrease with increasing temperature t 20 40 60 c and that the peak concentrations of sps appear earlier than those of pb2 thus a longer time is needed for hms than for sps to reach a steady state which can be attributed to the size exclusion effect on sps bennacer et al 2013 bai et al 2019 and the large molecular dispersion effect on hms table 3 fig 10 shows the results in the case of repeated pulse injection clearly the experimental and simulated results are consistent r 2 0 90 0 93 in fig 9 and r 2 0 88 0 92 in fig 10 which indicates that increasing the injection concentration of pb2 c m 100 300 500 μg ml causes an increase in pb2 concentration in the leachate c 4 41 6 07 11 57 μg ml c r 0 94 0 43 and 0 50 but a decrease in the concentration of sps c 0 0448 0 0345 0 0299 mg ml c r 0 48 0 37 and 0 32 6 conclusions an increase in temperature t 20 80 c will not affect the motion of individual hms in a porous medium and the migration velocity and dispersion are consistent with those in water thus temperature and darcy velocity have a negligible effect on the transport of individual hms however the recovery ratio of cd2 is higher than that of pb2 which can be attributed to the lower adsorption of cd2 on the solid matrix in addition their recovery ratios increase with increasing injection concentration of hms the presence of sps can facilitate the transport of hms pb2 and cd2 due to the strong adsorption of positively charged hms on negatively charged sps however this effect tends to decrease with the size of the sio2 particles the recovery ratio of pb2 decreases with increasing injection concentration while the opposite trend is observed for the recovery ratio of cd2 which can be related to their different interactions with the porous medium an increase in temperature e g t 20 60 c results in a decrease in the recovery ratio of hms because at high temperatures sps would collide more frequently and violently with other sps or the solid matrix and hms adsorbed on sps would be deposited in the pores of the porous medium the adsorption of hms on sps can change the dielectric properties of the sps thus causing a reduction in the repulsion between the sps and the solid matrix and a consequent decrease in the recovery ratio of the sps by distinguishing the differences in particle size and dielectric property between the hms and sps the proposed theoretical model is capable of describing the cotransport processes of hms and sps credit authorship

4658,the cotransport of heavy metals hms i e pb2 and cd2 and sio2 suspended particles sps in a porous medium quartz sand at different temperatures was investigated by one dimensional laboratory column experiments considering the significant differences in particle size and dielectric property between hms and sps a theoretical model describing their cotransport was developed in this study the results show that temperature and darcy velocity have a negligible effect on the transport of individual hms and that the recovery ratio of cd2 is higher than that of pb2 which can be attributed to the lower adsorption of cd2 on the solid matrix the presence of sps can facilitate the transport of hms due to the strong adsorption of positively charged hms on negatively charged sps however this effect tends to decrease with the size of the sio2 particles an increase in temperature e g t 20 60 c results in a decrease in the recovery ratio of hms because more hms adsorbed on sps can be deposited at high temperatures the adsorption of hms on sps can also change the dielectric properties of the sps thus causing a reduction in the repulsion between the sps and the solid matrix and a consequent decrease in the recovery ratio of sps in addition the results show that the developed model fits well with the experimental results keywords sio2 particle heavy metal temperature cotransport theoretical model 1 introduction the transport of heavy metals hms in groundwater and the resulting interactions between hms and the soil medium are vital topics in environmental geotechnology arab et al 2014 tansel and rafiuddin 2016 bai et al 2020 hms e g pb2 and cd2 in the soil medium are characterized by high mobility and chemical activity hudcová et al 2018 kamrani et al 2018 moreover the presence of mobile solid particles in the soil medium such as bacteria colloids and other suspended particles sps e g silicon powders may supply potential vehicles for the transport of hms cui et al 2018 thereby inducing an increase in the migration rate of these hms pang et al 2005 sun et al 2010 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2016 therefore a better grasp of the cotransport of hms and sps is imperative for the restoration of polluted soil layers karathanasis 1999 indicated that the presence of colloidal particles typically accelerated metal transport by 5 to 50 fold over that of the control treatment with zn2 being consistently more mobile than cu2 zhu et al 2014 found that a reduction in ionic strength and flow interruption could enhance colloid facilitated hg transport in contaminated soils in column experiments malkovsky et al 2015 showed colloid facilitated migration of radioactive uranium u by seepage groundwater from an underground source at the ore field to the earth s surface in eastern transbaikalia several cotransport models for colloid facilitated contaminant transport have been proposed valsala and govindarajan 2019 bekhit et al 2009 proposed a theoretical model to account for the transport mechanisms of contaminants reaction kinetics and different physicochemical and biological processes in the presence of colloids and bacteria in groundwater which was verified against experimental data for cd2 transport in the absence and presence of e coli vegetative cells katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 developed a conceptual model that describes the cotransport of viruses and colloids in a saturated porous medium with uniform flow which could account for the transport of individual viruses and colloids as well as viruses attached onto colloids borazjani and bedrikovetsky 2017 revealed multiple mechanisms for the capture of sps and derived analytical solutions for a two phase flow it is known that the cotransport of hms and sps critically depends on their charge characteristics positively charged hms can be adsorbed onto the surface of negatively charged sps e g sio2 particles at the same time the small sized sps e g silicon powders can accelerate the migration of hms because of the size exclusion effect ahfir et al 2017 bennacer et al 2017 chen et al 2018 russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 bai et al 2019 and yet sps with a size larger than the soil pore dimension can be entrapped in pore constrictions hence inhibiting the transport of hms in addition charged sps are likely to be adsorbed onto the surface of an oppositely charged solid matrix resulting in inhibition of the transport of sps thus repulsion between charges can greatly facilitate the transport of sps the interaction mechanisms of different hms with the porous medium and their migration processes can differ completely zhu et al 2014 agbozu and bassey 2016 hudcová et al 2018 wu and li 1998 simulated the transport of four hms cd2 pb2 cu2 and zn2 in a hypothetical sand bentonite clay column and the results showed that their mobility followed the order cu2 zn2 pb2 cd2 in neutral ph 7 leachate but cd2 zn2 cu2 pb2 in more acidic leachate naidu et al 1994 investigated the effects of ph ph range of 3 8 and the ionic strength of ca2 and na in two oxisols mena and malanda on the adsorption of cd2 the results showed that for all soils the adsorption of cd2 increased with increasing ph value moreover most of the discrepancy in adsorption could be interpreted by the differences in negative surface charges although the influence of ionic strength on the adsorption of cd2 changed substantially depending on the soil and ph tang et al 2013 showed that soluble organic matter in water e g carbon could contend for sorption sites or form soluble complexes with hms thereby reducing the adsorption of hms by the soil medium to accelerate the migration of hms kumpiene 2015 discussed the biochemical activity hm availability microbial functional diversity and soil toxicity of cd2 pb2 and zn2 contaminated soils to recover their ecological environments besides ma et al 2016 stated clearly that the transport of colloidal particles accelerated as v migration by blocking the adsorption of as v onto sand although soil colloids had low adsorption capacity for as v in general a larger relative specific surface area of fine particles in the soil medium corresponds to a greater adsorption of toxic contaminants tang et al 2013 agbozu and bassey 2016 the existence of sps can accelerate or inhibit the transport of hms attributing to the interactions of hms or sps with the porous medium and physical chemical changes in seepage flow such as the sp dimensions solution ph ionic concentration critical salt concentration van der waals force and double layer repulsive force bedrikovetsky et al 2012 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 valsala and govindarajan 2019 however despite the recognized importance of temperature in the transport of contaminants bradford et al 2009 garcía garcía et al 2009 kim and walker 2009 arab et al 2014 bär et al 2015 the role of temperature in the cotransport of hms and sps remains to be elucidated in this study the cotransport of hms pb2 and cd2 and sps in a porous medium was investigated in a one dimensional laboratory column experiment under varying temperature darcy velocity sp particle size and hm injection concentration further by distinguishing the variance in particle size and dielectric property a theoretical cotransport model for hms and sps based on the convection diffusion deposition hydrodynamics of particles was proposed and then verified against experimental data 2 experimental 2 1 experimental setup the cylindrical chamber used in the experimental tests is made of plexiglass fig 1 the specimen column is 300 mm in height and 80 mm in diameter with a height to diameter ratio of 3 75 prior to the experiment the cylindrical chamber was filled with quartz sand and maintained in a temperature controlled water bath and the water to be supplied to the chamber was also maintained at the same temperature in a temperature controlled water tank hh420 joyn co shanghai china operating temperature range 0 100 c the temperature could be controlled within 0 2 c the deionized water in the temperature controlled water tank was pumped into the cylindrical chamber at a constant velocity using a peristaltic pump bt600 2j longerpump co baoding china control range 120 1200 ml min the water was injected vertically from the top to the bottom of the chamber which could be assumed to be a one dimensional steady flow mesh screens of 0 5 mm in diameter were placed at both the inlet and outlet of the chamber to ensure a steady flow and prevent the escape of the quartz sand the tested suspension was injected into the chamber using a 60 ml syringe from the top of the column the leachate was collected using a 30 ml special plastic bottle to measure the concentration of hms and sps the concentration of hms was measured using the graphite furnace method tas 990g persee general instrument co beijing china according to the concentration absorbance relationship the turbidity of sps in the leachate was determined using a turbidity meter type 2100 n hach co usa measurement range 0 4000 nephelometric turbidity units ntus and then the concentration of sps was determined based on the concentration turbidity relationship 2 2 porous medium sio2 particles and hms low reactive quartz sand analytically pure main mineral constituent sio2 density 2 65 g cm3 prepared by mechanical crushing of quartzite was utilized as the porous matter the quartz sand had a white lustrous surface with high acid and alkali resistance the particle size ranged from 1 3 5 mm with a median of 2 2 mm and particles of 1 2 mm and 2 0 3 5 mm accounted for approximately 26 and 74 of all particles respectively the curvature coefficient was c c 1 08 and the nonuniformity coefficient was c u 2 11 the impurities on the surface of the quartz sand particles such as aluminum and iron oxides were removed by rinsing with 0 01 mol l naoh and hno3 solutions for 10 min before the experiment and then the quartz sand was washed repeatedly with deionized water until the ph of the water remained constant to guarantee a high saturation degree of the sand column 20 ml of deionized water was first added to the cylindrical chamber and the outlet was adjusted to ensure no bubbles at the bottom then quartz sand was introduced and stirred using a glass rod to compactly pack the sand this step was repeated to ensure the packing of the quartz sand and each time the water level was kept 2 cm above the top of the porous medium the final porosity of the saturated sand column was n 41 67 spherical sio2 particles were prepared by dry grinding of natural quartzite fig 2 fuhong mineral products co shanxi china which had a dry density of 2 2 g cm3 and various excellent properties such as high temperature resistance insolubility in acidic and alkaline solutions and high chemical stability the transport of sps can be affected by their particle size and geometrical morphology molecular diffusion electrostatic force hydrodynamic process and gravity thus sio2 particles with median diameters of d 50 2 8 10 9 and 18 7 μm were used fig 2 because these sizes would not cause severe entrapment of the sps in pore constrictions in the quartz sand column the adsorption property and pattern of hms in the soil medium may differ substantially due to differences in the size and quantity of charges kumpiene 2015 katip et al 2016 thus two typical hms pb2 with an atomic weight of 207 2 and cd2 with an atomic weight of 112 411 were used because of the low solubility of pb2 and its high adsorption on sio2 particles sps can have a more significant effect on the transport of pb2 than the transport of cd2 different concentrations of pb2 solutions were prepared by dissolving analytically pure pb no3 2 powder and sio2 particles in deionized water given that pb2 and cd2 exist mainly as ions in a slightly acidic state the pb2 solution was adjusted to ph 5 5 by adding an appropriate amount of 0 01 mol l naoh or hno3 solution as necessary the cd2 solution could be prepared by diluting a 100 μg ml cd no3 2 solution with deionized water the high coordination capacity of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta disodium salt makes it possible to form stable chelates with almost all metal ions in this experiment 0 05 mol l edta disodium salt was utilized as the extraction reagent which could produce high extraction efficiency 90 for both pb2 and cd2 nedwed and clifford 2000 fangueiro et al 2002 2 3 experimental schemes laboratory experiments were accomplished to discuss the transport of pb2 or cd2 alone and the cotransport of pb2 or cd2 with sps because the pb2 concentration in a geotechnical environment is generally higher in some cases even by several orders of magnitudes than the cd2 concentration agbozu and bassey 2016 tansel and rafiuddin 2016 the concentrations of the pb2 solutions were set to c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml table 1 whereas those of the cd2 solutions were set to c m 100 300 and 500 ng ml in view of the temperature of the discard solution that may be encountered in actual engineering different temperatures are also set herein e g t 20 40 and 60 c the injection concentration of sps was fixed at c inj 2 mg ml the experiment was started 30 min after both the water bath tank and the temperature controlled water tank reached the predetermined temperature to maintain a constant temperature throughout the experiment as a single pulse injection pattern a solution volume of v inj 30 ml pb2 cd2 or sps alone or a mixture of pb2 or cd2 with sps was injected into the sample column over a short period of 2 s leachate with high turbidity was diluted prior to measuring the turbidity of the sps to extract hms adsorbed on the surface of the sps the leachate was shaken for 4 h in a constant temperature oscillator hy 4 changzhou china vibration amplitude 0 20 mm vibration frequency 0 300 rpm to ensure the formation of stable chelates with the extraction reagent edta subsequently the hms and sps were separated using a low speed desktop centrifuge with a maximum rotation speed of 6500 rpm l3 6k hunan co china the supernatant was collected for the measurement of the hm absorbance in addition a repeated pulse injection of hm solutions at concentrations of c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml was also carried out at t 20 c the particle size of the sps was d 50 2 8 μm the injection concentration was c inj 2 mg ml and the flow velocity was v 0 087 cm s the injection time was t inj 1 2 s t inj 2 1 s and t inj 3 1 s the injection rate was 15 ml s and the injection time was t p 1 0 t p 2 240 and t p 3 360 s 3 transport process of pb2 or cd2 pore volume v p is defined as the ratio of the total volume of water flowing through the column to the void volume of the column and it facilitates comparisons of experimental results at different darcy velocities on the same time scale to compare the experimental results

260 cm s similar trends can also be observed in the btcs of cd2 table 2 indicates a large difference in the peak c r values of pb2 and cd2 in the leachate which can be attributed to the large difference in concentration between the pb2 and cd2 injection solutions pb2 c m 100 300 and 500 μg ml cd2 c m 100 300 and 500 ng ml and in their adsorption and desorption in the porous medium nevertheless the experimental results show that at the same c m temperature appears to have no effect on the transport of hms in the porous medium for instance the peak c r values of pb2 for t 20 40 and 60 c are very close c r 0 058 0 060 at a darcy velocity of v 0 087 cm s and an injection concentration of c m 100 μg ml whereas for cd2 the same phenomenon can also be observed c r 0 226 0 238 at v 0 087 cm s and c m 100 ng ml however pb2 is more likely to be deposited than cd2 due to its higher adsorption on the negatively charged matrix of the porous medium the main mineral constituent is sio2 which results in a smaller peak c r of pb2 in the leachate fig 3 fig 3 reveals an obvious tailing phenomena at the later stage of the btcs indicating desorption of the adsorbed hms importantly the btcs obtained at v 0 087 0 173 and 0 260 cm s were nearly the same demonstrating that the seepage velocity has a negligible influence on the transport of individual hms under acidic conditions a portion of the hms can be dissolved in water and move with it whereas the remainder of the hms can be adsorbed onto the soil matrix some of these adsorbed hms can be released into the water when the concentration of hms in the solution is low clearly changes in temperature from 20 80 c as examined in this study may have no significant effects on the transport of hms and thus could result in almost identical btcs at different temperatures however as the injection concentration of hms increases the peak c r increases accordingly for instance fig 3 indicates that an increase in the injection concentration of pb2 c m 100 300 500 μg ml at v 0 087 cm s causes an increase in the average peak c r c r 0 060 0 082 0 101 and actual concentration c 0 279 1 146 2 352 μg ml of pb2 obtained at the four temperatures table 2 also reveals that an increase in the injection concentration of cd2 from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml at v 0 087 cm s leads to an increase in the average peak c r from c r 0 233 to c r 0 478 4 cotransport processes of hms and sps 4 1 influences of temperature on the btcs typical experimental results obtained at v 0 087 cm s are shown in table 2 and the btcs of pb2 at an injection concentration of c m 100 μg ml are shown in fig 4 a close comparison of fig 4 a b and c reveals that the darcy velocity has no significant effect on the transport of pb2 in the presence of sio2 particles resulting in almost identical btcs similar tailing phenomena are also observed indicating the desorption of deposited hms fig 4 shows that the peak c r of pb2 in the presence of sio2 particles is higher than that in the absence of sio2 particles fig 3 for instance the peak c r of pb2 in the presence of sio2 particles at d 50 2 8 μm c m 100 μg ml and t 20 c table 2 is 14 8 times that in the absence of sio2 particles indicating that sps can significantly facilitate the transport of pb2 similarly the peak c r of cd2 in the presence of sio2 particles at d 50 2 8 μm c m 100 ng ml and t 20 c table 2 is 2 9 times that in the absence of sio2 particles which is lower than that of pb2 thus the transport of cd2 is less facilitated by sps than that of pb2 which can be attributed to the weak adsorption of cd2 on sio2 particles qiao et al 2017 in general the higher the amount of hms adsorbed on sps the more significant the sp facilitated transport of hms however it is important to note that the presence of sps with a large particle size may inhibit the transport of cd2 at high temperatures and injection concentrations e g d 50 18 7 μm t 60 c c m 500 ng ml table 2 thus the c r of cd2 in the leachate in the presence of sps c r 0 398 is slightly lower than that in the absence of sps c r 0 463 fig 4 shows that the peak c r of hms decreases significantly with increasing temperature which is in accordance with the btcs of sio2 particles fig 5 thus the transport of sps can have significant coupling effects on that of hms due to the adsorption of hms on sps as a consequence the concentration of hms especially pb2 in the leachate critically depends on the concentration of sps in addition the complex physical and chemical interactions among the porous medium matrix hms and sps can significantly delay the transport of sps and increase the deposition coefficient at high temperatures resulting in a low peak c r in the btc from figs 3 and 4 the presence of sps causes an increase in the peak c r of hms and earlier transport of pb2 as indicated by the smaller v p corresponding to the peak c r this phenomenon indicates that sps can facilitate the transport of pb2 it is known that negatively charged sps have a high adsorption capacity for positively charged hms such as pb2 sps can move with water natarajan and kumar 2011 cui et al 2019 and act as a third phase mobile solid phase particle b in fig 6 in addition to the immobile solid phase of the porous medium thus pb2 can be adsorbed on sps in a similar fashion as on the immobile solid matrix and then migrate in the subsurface medium at a rate similar to or even higher than that in the mobile aqueous phase due to the size exclusion effect bai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 fig 5 presents the btcs of sps in the presence or absence of pb2 at c m 100 μg ml and c inj 2 mg ml clearly the peak c r values of sps are decreased in the presence of pb2 compared to the absence of pb2 especially for those sps with a large particle size e g d 50 18 7 μm the adsorption of pb2 on sps can reduce the repulsive force between the sps and the soil matrix by the dlvo theory due to the decrease in the absolute zeta potentials corresponding to their surface charge sugimoto et al 2014 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 ahfir et al 2017 bai et al 2020 inducing an increase in the deposition of sps on the soil matrix therefore the coupling effect of pb2 which is due to the decrease in the double electric layer on the sp surface decrease in surface potential energy cannot be neglected the peak c r values of hms and sps decrease with increasing particle size of the sps figs 4 and 5 obviously sps with a larger particle size are more likely to be entrapped at pore constrictions in the soil matrix inducing an increase in the deposition coefficient of the sps bedrikovetsky et al 2017 bai et al 2019 and a possible delay in the peak concentration altoé et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 accordingly hms adsorbed on sps can also be deposited indicating a strong coupling effect between them for this reason the peak c r of pb2 that can be easily adsorbed on sps decreases with increasing pb2 injection concentration in the range examined c m 100 500 μg ml which is opposite to the transport of pb2 in the absence of sps in fact more pb2 can be adsorbed on sps at a higher pb2 injection concentration which can increase the attraction between the oppositely charged sps and the porous medium matrix as a result sps are more likely to be adsorbed on the matrix leaving fewer sps in the leachate and thus causing a decrease in the pb2 concentration in the leachate however the peak c r of cd2 that shows weak adsorption on sps increases with increasing injection concentration in this case the transport of cd2 by itself is dominant for instance increasing the injection concentration of cd2 from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml at v 0 087 cm s d 50 2 8 μm and t 20 c results in an increase in the peak c r from c r 0 667 to c r 1 070 table 2 a comparison between figs 4 and 5 reveals that the peak c r of the sps appears earlier than that of the hms indicating accelerated transport of the sps due to the size exclusion effect fig 5 also shows that an increase in temperature would further exacerbate the irregular movement of sps in the porous medium and even reduce the migration velocity of hms and sps fig 4 4 2 recovery ratio of hms and sps the recovery ratio of an individual contaminant e g hms or sps alone can be calculated by integrating the area of simulated btcs katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 ahfir et al 2017 2 r e 0 q c t d t m where r e is the recovery ratio t is the time t q va is the flow rate l3t 1 v is the darcy velocity lt 1 and a is the cross sectional area of the column l2 figs 7 and 8 show the recovery ratios of hms c m 100 and 500 μg ml for pb2 and c m 100 and 500 ng ml for cd2 and sps respectively which are plotted as a function of the particle size at different temperatures using mathematica 9 by wolfram research r 2 0 95 except for some curves for the transport of only pb2 i e d 50 0 r e 3 26 3 43 when c m 100 μg ml and r e 5 19 4 98 when c m 500 μg ml fig 7 thus indicating a low recovery ratio 5 of pb2 however a portion of the hms adsorbed on sps can move with the sps resulting in an increase in the recovery ratio of the hms for instance at d 50 2 8 μm and c inj 2 mg ml the recovery ratio is r e 42 09 44 17 when c m 100 μg ml and r e 31 39 31 41 when c m 500 μg ml which are 6 10 times higher than the ratios for the transport of pb2 in the absence of sps for the transport of only cd2 i e d 50 0 r e 15 52 16 74 when c m 100 ng ml and r e 25 59 31 60 when c m 500 ng ml the presence of sps can also result in a significant increase in the recovery ratio of cd2 for instance at d 50 2 8 μm and c inj 2 mg ml for sps the recovery ratio of cd2 is r e 46 94 55 12 when c m 100 ng ml and r e 63 74 75 97 when c m 500 ng ml which are 2 3 times higher than those for the transport of only cd2 clearly the recovery ratio of cd2 is much higher than that of pb2 fig 7 indicates that the recovery ratios of both pb2 and cd2 without the existence of sps increase with increasing injection concentration of hms for instance the increase of pb2 injection concentration from c m 100 μg ml to c m 500 μg ml at t 20 c results in an increase in the recovery ratio from r e 3 26 3 43 to r e 4 98 5 19 whereas the increase in cd2 injection concentration from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml results in an increase in the recovery ratio from r e 15 52 16 74 to r e 23 98 31 60 relative to the changes in the peak concentration in the btcs table 2 an opposite trend is observed for pb2 in the presence of sps see the downward arrows in fig 7 for instance the increase in pb2 injection concentration from c m 100 μg ml to c m 500 μg ml at d 50 2 8 μm and t 20 c results in a decrease in the recovery ratio from r e 42 09 44 17 to r e 31 39 31 41 however the recovery ratio of cd2 increases with increasing injection concentration see the upward arrows in fig 7 for instance increasing the cd2 injection concentration from c m 100 ng ml to c m 500 ng ml at d 50 2 8 μm and t 20 c causes an increase in the recovery ratio from r e 49 64 55 12 to r e 63 74 75 97 in fact most pb2 can still be adsorbed on the solid matrix and sps and then deposited even at a high injection concentration due to the strong interactions between pb2 and the matrix and sps leaving less pb2 to be taken away by water or sps by contrast cd2 is more likely to be dissolved in water rather than adsorbed on the solid matrix and sps at a high injection concentration due to the weak interactions between cd2 and the matrix and sps resulting in a higher recovery ratio the recovery ratio of pb2 decreases slightly as the particle size of the sps increases d 50 2 8 10 9 18 7 μm indicating that sps with a larger particle size are less able to facilitate the transport of pb2 which can be attributed to the large deposition of hms however compared with the recovery ratio of pb2 the recovery ratio of cd2 shows a more marked decrease with increasing particle size of the sps as an example when c m 500 ng ml and v 0 260 cm s the recovery ratio of cd2 is r e 64 65 54 38 and 31 53 at d 50 2 8 10 9 and 18 7 μm respectively it is also noted that as the particle size of the sps increases to d 50 18 7 μm the recovery ratios of pb2 and cd2 tend to be similar and the deposition effect of the sps becomes more pronounced fig 8 fig 7 indicates that the recovery ratio of hms tends to decrease as the temperature increases t 20 40 60 c at a high temperature e g t 60 c fig 7 c the differences in the effects of the injection concentration and darcy velocity on the recovery ratios of pb2 and cd2 become less pronounced in this case temperature is the dominant factor affecting the recovery ratio of hms which can be attributed to the high deposition of sps fig 8 c at this point sps would collide more frequently and violently with other sps or the solid matrix and their motion trajectory would become more complex accordingly hms adsorbed on sps also move in a complex manner and most of these hm ions are deposited in the pores of the porous medium see process 2 in fig 6 the adsorption of hms on sps can change the dielectric properties of the surface of sps thus causing a reduction in the repulsion between the sps and the solid matrix thus the presence of hms can inhibit the transport of sps however it is important to note that this inhibitory effect increases with increasing the injection concentration of hms see the comparison between the hollow and green dot curves in fig 8 thus the coupling effect of hms on the transport of sps should be taken into account in the cotransport model fig 8 also shows that the recovery ratio of sps decreases with increasing particle size of the sps which is in line with previous findings bennacer et al 2013 ahfir et al 2017 bai et al 2019 5 cotransport model of hms and sps 5 1 governing equations the convection dispersion deposition model is often used to describe the transport of an individual contaminant such as hms viruses and solid particles wang et al 2012 bedrikovetsky et al 2017 russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 as well as the cotransport of multiphase sps bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 in this study the cotransport of hms and sps fig 6 involves the following three pathways some hms or sps are deposited on the porous medium matrix and some are dissolved or suspended in water and move with it while other hms are adsorbed on sps and then move with water or are deposited on the solid matrix the adsorption deposition of hms or sps is also affected by the desorption release of existing deposited matter processes 1 4 in fig 6 thus the cotransport of hms and sps involves the transport of three species of matter hms sps and sps coupled with hms denoted by mps for the cotransport of two species of matter with a similar particle size their coupling effect on each other is equivalent however for the transport of two species of matter with large differences in particle size and dielectric properties the coupling effect of one species of matter on the transport of the other species of matter may be neglected whereas the opposite effect must be considered for instance for the cotransport of hms and sps some hm ions migrate individually whereas others are absorbed on the surface of sps and move with the sps fig 6 for this process a new theoretical cotransport model for hms and sps is proposed by distinguishing the variance in particle size and dielectric property given the large coupling effect of constituent j e g sps on constituent i e g hms the transport process of constituent i is governed by the convection dispersion equation bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 3 t c i z t ρ s n σ i z t d i 2

of species i and coupled species of i and j l2t 1 respectively and ui is the average interstitial velocity of species i lt 1 the dispersivity of each species is defined as α d i di u 0 and α d ij dij u 0 where u 0 is the average interstitial fluid velocity u 0 v n in eq 3 the transport processes of individual constituent i and those of constituent i absorbed on constituent j are described by the first and second terms on the left side of the equation respectively while the movement of constituent i with water and that of constituent i absorbed on constituent j are described on the right side at cij z t 0 and σij z t 0 eq 3 can be used to describe the transport of constituent i with no coupling with constituent j for the transport of sps with a much larger mass than the hms the mass coupling effect of hms can be neglected however the strong electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged hms and sps sio2 particles makes it easy for hms to be adsorbed on sps in this case the transport of sps coupled with hms i e mps is dominant fig 6 particles a and b i e the transport of individual sps particles c and d can be neglected as a result the transport equation of sps can be greatly simplified and can be assumed to be the same as that for the transport of individual sps the adsorption of hms on sps may cause changes in the dielectric properties of the surface of the sps and corresponding changes in the migration velocity dispersion coefficient and deposition coefficient of the sps as the mass of hms is negligibly smaller than that of sps the mass of sps coupled with hms should show no discernible change changes in the density ρ s and porosity n of the porous medium are also not considered in the cotransport of hms and sps thus the transport of sps coupled with hms i e mps can be derived from eq 3 4 c j z t t ρ s n σ j z t t d ij 2 c j z t z 2 u ij c j z t z where uij is the transport velocity of mps substituting the subscript ij with j yields the hydrodynamic equation for the transport of sps in the absence of hms as described in eq 4 at this point dj and α d j dj u 0 are the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and dispersivity for the transport of sps in the absence of hms respectively and uj is the average interstitial velocity of sps alone the release of adsorbed hms or mps can have a significant effect on the deposition kinetics for a variable concentration injection the equation accounting for the release of hms process 1 in fig 6 or mps process 2 in fig 6 from the solid matrix can be derived by a linear kinetic approach ahfir et al 2017 bennacer et al 2013 5 ρ s n σ i z t t k d i c i z t k r i ρ s n σ i z t where k d i and k r i are the deposition coefficient and release coefficient of hms or mps when the subscript i is replaced by j respectively t 1 studies have focused on the mathematical modeling of the cotransport of multiphase particles bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 clearly there is a complex coupling effect between mobile and immobile particles fig 5 a particles a and b and between particles and the solid matrix in the transport of multiphaseflowcontainingsolid particles overall the adsorption of hms on sps deposited on the matrix is closely related to the concentration of mps in the aqueous solution thus considering the release effect the concentration of hms absorbed onto sps already attached onto the solid matrix can be described as follows process 2 in fig 6 6 t σ j z t σ ij z t k d j i j c j z t c ij z t k r j i j ρ s n σ j z t σ ij z t where k d j ij and k r j ij are the deposition coefficient and release coefficient between mps and the solid matrix respectively t 1 hms adsorbed on sps can be released into the aqueous solution due to hydrodynamic action particle capture and detachment in porous media are closely related to the seepage velocity particle size and even the maximum retention concentration bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 for the attachment detachment process between two suspended substances it is simply assumed that the linear action process is satisfied thus the concentration of hms adsorbed on sps in the aqueous phase can be described as follows process 3 in fig 6 7 σ ij z t t k d i j c ij z t k r i j σ ij z t where k d ij and k r ij are the adsorption coefficient and release coefficient between hms and sps in the aqueous phase respectively t 1 5 2 determination of transport parameters the hydrodynamic parameters involved in the cotransport of hms and sps such as migration velocity dispersion coefficient deposition coefficient and release coefficient are determined based on the experimental results the proposed transport equations can be used to fit the btcs obtained by the pulse experiments in sections 4 and 5 accurately fitting more than three transport parameters simultaneously is always difficult and to obtain unique results the number of parameters to be fitted should be minimized the parameters are determined as follows i the migration velocity ui hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient di di α d i u 0 deposition coefficient k d i and release coefficient k r i of hms i hms can be obtained from eqs 3 and 5 based on the btcs for the transport of individual hms however cij z t 0 and σij z t 0 in eq 3 due to the absence of sps for simplicity it is assumed that k r i 0 1k d i bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 because compared with the deposition coefficient k d i the release coefficient k r i is usually very small ii as sps are always coupled with hms during cotransport no sps alone are present for sps coupled with hms i e mps their transport parameters differ substantially from those of sps alone due to the charges of the hms adsorbed on the sps at this point the migration velocity uij hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dij dij α d ij u 0 deposition coefficient k d j and release coefficient k r j of mps can be obtained from eqs 4 and 5 based on the btcs of sps for the cotransport of hms and sps similarly it is also assumed that k r j 0 1k d j leaving only three parameters to be fitted among these parameters for simplicity the dispersion coefficient and migration velocity of mps can be assumed to be similar to those of sps alone thus dij dj and uij uj eq 4 however the experimental results show a large difference in deposition coefficient between mps and sps alone due to the charge of the hms absorbed on the sps iii in eq 6 as the deposition and release of hms adsorbed on sps depend on the deposition and release of mps it is simply assumed that k d j ij k d j and k r j ij 0 1k d j ij in addition the adsorption coefficient k d ij and desorption coefficient k r ij between hms and sps ij mp can be determined based on isothermal adsorption and desorption experiments however as the ratio of the two parameters is generally small they can be assumed to be proportional e g k r ij 0 1k d ij 5 3 solutions and verification initially the assumption is that particles are not adsorbed on the solid matrix and the mixed solutions of hms and sps are injected from the top of the column the initial and boundary conditions are set as follows ci z 0 0 σi z 0 0 and ci 0 0 i hms sps mp for the instantaneous injection the concentration of each species applied on the top surface of the column is as follows 8 c i 0 t m v inj q t inj 1 h t t inj where h t is the heaviside step function and t inj is the injection time t the perturbation caused by the instantaneous injection of a suspension e g v inj 30 ml and t inj 2 s at a small darcy velocity e g v 0 087 cm s is likely to change the seepage velocity of the flow in the sand column therefore we assume that u 0 t vat inj v inj nat inj u 0 v inj nat inj during the injection time t inj thus the actual seepage velocity in the porous medium during the injection is revised as follows 9 u 0 t u 0 v inj n a t inj 1 h t t inj eq 9 shows that u 0 t u 0 when t t inj and that u 0 t u 0 when t t inj the transport parameters can be fitted using origin 8 5 originlab corporation based on the experimental results as an example table 3 shows the values of parameters obtained at a darcy velocity v 0 087 cm s and temperatures of t 20 40 and 60 c for a pb2 solution with a concentration of c m 100 μg ml and a cd2 solution with a concentration of c m 100 ng ml r 2 0 96 table 3 also displays the adsorption and desorption coefficients of the hms and sps where k d j ij k d j and k r j ij 0 1k d j ij six unknown parameters must be determined ci z t cj z t σi z t σj z t cij z t and σij z t specifically cj z t and σj z t of the sps are determined by eqs 4 and 5 cij z t and σij z t are determined by eqs 6 and 7 and ci z t and σi z t are approximated by eqs 3 and 5 respectively the iteration is repeated until the required accuracy is reached the cotransport processes of hms and sps can be simulated using the pardiso solver in comsol numerical software comsol co the fitting parameters are shown in table 3 and the controlling parameters are shown in table 4 fig 9 shows the experimental and simulated btcs for the cotransport of pb2 and sps when d 50 2 8 μm and v 0 087 cm s in the case of single pulse injection the simulated results also revealed that the peak concentrations of hms decrease with increasing temperature t 20 40 60 c and that the peak concentrations of sps appear earlier than those of pb2 thus a longer time is needed for hms than for sps to reach a steady state which can be attributed to the size exclusion effect on sps bennacer et al 2013 bai et al 2019 and the large molecular dispersion effect on hms table 3 fig 10 shows the results in the case of repeated pulse injection clearly the experimental and simulated results are consistent r 2 0 90 0 93 in fig 9 and r 2 0 88 0 92 in fig 10 which indicates that increasing the injection concentration of pb2 c m 100 300 500 μg ml causes an increase in pb2 concentration in the leachate c 4 41 6 07 11 57 μg ml c r 0 94 0 43 and 0 50 but a decrease in the concentration of sps c 0 0448 0 0345 0 0299 mg ml c r 0 48 0 37 and 0 32 6 conclusions an increase in temperature t 20 80 c will not affect the motion of individual hms in a porous medium and the migration velocity and dispersion are consistent with those in water thus temperature and darcy velocity have a negligible effect on the transport of individual hms however the recovery ratio of cd2 is higher than that of pb2 which can be attributed to the lower adsorption of cd2 on the solid matrix in addition their recovery ratios increase with increasing injection concentration of hms the presence of sps can facilitate the transport of hms pb2 and cd2 due to the strong adsorption of positively charged hms on negatively charged sps however this effect tends to decrease with the size of the sio2 particles the recovery ratio of pb2 decreases with increasing injection concentration while the opposite trend is observed for the recovery ratio of cd2 which can be related to their different interactions with the porous medium an increase in temperature e g t 20 60 c results in a decrease in the recovery ratio of hms because at high temperatures sps would collide more frequently and violently with other sps or the solid matrix and hms adsorbed on sps would be deposited in the pores of the porous medium the adsorption of hms on sps can change the dielectric properties of the sps thus causing a reduction in the repulsion between the sps and the solid matrix and a consequent decrease in the recovery ratio of the sps by distinguishing the differences in particle size and dielectric property between the hms and sps the proposed theoretical model is capable of describing the cotransport processes of hms and sps credit authorship

4659,to prevent contaminant ions from spreading over the adjacent environment it is of great interest to consider using electro kinetic barriers to counteract contaminant transport through the combined effects of electro osmosis and electro migration in this study considering the bottom surface as a cauchy boundary or a drichlet boundary condition two analytical solutions are proposed to predict the contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier analytical solutions are verified against experimental data and numerical solutions from the previous literature subsequently the proposed analytical solutions are used to investigate the effects of average applied voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient retardation factor and electro osmotic conductivity on the transport of contaminant through the electro kinetic barrier the results show that the steady state base contaminant concentration decreases with the increase in average voltage gradient and barrier thickness additionally the logarithm of the final stable base contaminant concentration changes linearly with the average applied voltage gradient and barrier thickness for the contaminants with a high diffusion coefficient a larger average voltage gradient should be applied to improve the electro kinetic effects clayey soils with high sorption capacity and relatively high electro osmotic conductivity are the suggested material choice for constructing compacted soil liners within the electro kinetic barrier due to distinct advantages in contaminant migration prevention finally a dimensionless factor is introduced to uniformly describe influences on the base relative concentration and it can be used as an important parameter for the design of an electro kinetic barrier keywords analytical solution electro kinetic barrier contaminant migration parameter study 1 introduction improper disposal and accidental spillage of toxic and hazardous chemicals from domestic agricultural and industrial activities have led to significant soil contamination creating an urgent need to find feasible solutions to the problem containment barrier technology such as slurry walls sheet pile cut off walls and grout curtains is an effective method to protect the soil and ground water from potential contamination acar and haider 1990 however these containment technologies are relatively expensive and time consuming to construct and may require the use of specialized equipment the availability of suitable access for machinery and large equipment to reach the contaminated site has become a major limitation for the application of these conventional techniques in some situations narasimhan and ranjan 2000 moreover the long term behaviour of these conventional barriers under the interaction of compacted soil liners and contaminant ions is also an issue that should be addressed electro kinetic remediation is an emerging in situ method in which contaminants are mobilized and eventually recovered by passing a low current intensity between a row of anode and cathode electrodes inserted in the ground acar and alshawabkeh 1993 acar et al 1995 yeung et al 1997 mulligan et al 2001 page and page 2002 this application exploits the transport processes of ions in solution by electro osmosis and electro migration electro osmosis is the movement of water that results from an applied electric gradient while electro migration is the movement of ions in solution in an electric field by using electro osmosis and electro migration the idea of creating an electro kinetic barrier was conceived by lageman et al 1989 and successfully used to prevent the migration of heavy metal contaminants such as lead copper zinc and cadmium during the remediation of an abandoned paint factory godschalk and lageman 2005 as shown in fig 1 the idea underlying the use of an electro kinetic barrier to prevent contaminant migration is simple a counter gradient opposite to the direction of the groundwater gradient is created by a continuous or periodic application of an electrical potential difference between the electrodes which halts the movement of water within that region and effectively prevents the migration of contaminants yeung 1990 mitchell and yeung 1991 lynch et al 2007 although the concept was proposed some time ago little work on the calculation method of the electro kinetic barrier has been carried out it is now necessary to develop an effective calculation method to predict the transport of contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier for design convenience and field applications of this method considering four transport processes in the electro kinetic system namely electro migration diffusion electro osmosis and advective flow under hydraulic gradients acar and alshawabkeh 1993 shapiro and probstein 1993 acar et al 1995 yeung et al 1997 several numerical models have been developed for the predication of contaminant ion transport in electro kinetic extraction and remediation choi and lui 1995 alshawabkeh and acar 1996 mattson et al 2002 kim et al 2003 2004 amrate et al 2005 al hamdan and reddy 2008 paz garcía et al 2011 masi et al 2017 meanwhile yeung and mitchell 1993 have developed a general coupled flow theory for the electro kinetic barrier on the basis of the formalism of non equilibrium thermodynamics for analysis of the physics involved in the transport processes narasimhan and ranjan 2000 presented a numerical model that could predict the changes in ph pore water pressure and the voltage gradient along the length of the electro kinetic barrier numerical models play an important role in the prediction of contaminant transport in electro kinetic remediation systems but the level of numerical sophistication often greatly exceeds the sophistication of the available data especially at the site selection and preliminary design stages and the cost in terms of man hours of a detailed numerical analysis with the necessary checks on discretization error may not be justifiable under the circumstances rowe and nadarajah 1997 thus simplified analytical methods can provide an economic and efficient alternative to complex numerical models in many ways although rigorous restricted conditions are required in the field of conventional landfill barrier system analytical methods have generally been used since they can readily analyse the sensitivity of each individual parameter in question chen et al 2009 developed an analytical solution for 1d contaminant diffusion through a multi layered landfill barrier system to investigate the effects of the half life of contaminants on the solute flux of benzene diffused into the underlying aquifer considering arbitrary initial conditions subsequently a series of analytical studies regarding the diffusion of contaminants in landfill barriers have been conducted by considering different combinations of fixed solute concentrations and zero flux boundary conditions degradation effects of the organic contaminants sorption convection and unsaturated soils beneath the barrier system li and cleall 2010 xie et al 2013 zhao and burns 2013 zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2019 these analytical studies can provide the indications necessary to provide analytical solutions for the transport of contaminant ions in electro kinetic barriers the objective of this paper is to present a 1d analytical model capable of predicting contaminant ion transport in electro kinetic barriers considering the combined effect of concentration gradient hydraulic gradient electro osmosis and electro migration these analytical solutions are subjected to the cauchy boundary and drichlet boundary conditions respectively the proposed analytical solutions were validated by comparison with experimental and numerical results presented in previous literature finally using the proposed analytical solutions a parametric study was performed to investigate the influences of an average applied voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient retardation factor and electro osmotic conductivity on the contaminant ion migration in the electro kinetic barrier 2 theoretical background in this study we considered diffusion electro osmosis and electro migration as the main transport mechanisms for contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier since colloid migration is hindered by the immobile phase of the porous medium yu and neretnieks 1997 electrophoresis was neglected 2 1 electro osmosis electro osmosis is the movement of the pore water due to the viscous drag of the cations the negative charge on the surface of most soil particles will cause an accumulation of positively charged cations near the surface thus under an electrical potential gradient the pore water will be dragged by the cations and the net movement of the pore water will be towards the cathode the electro osmotic flow rate can be expressed by the following formulation 1 q eo k eo ϕ where q eo is electro osmotic flux m s 1 ϕ is electrical voltage gradient v m 1 and k eo is electro osmotic conductivity m2 v 1 s 1 which depends on several variables according to the hemlholtz smoluchowski theory it can be related to zeta potential ξ v and the dielectric constant ε 8 854 10 12 f m 1 and the viscosity η 1 10 3 ns m 2 of the fluid eykholt and daniel 1994 2 k eo ε ξ η n τ where the negative sign indicates that negatively charged particles produce an electro osmotic flow directed from anode to cathode the tortuosity τ and porosity n terms in eq 2 were introduced by casagrande 1949 to include the porous matrix effects in the original hemlholtz smoluchowski formulation in general the values of electro osmotic conductivity fall in the narrow range between 1 10 9 and 1 10 8 m2 v 1 s 1 compared with the values of hydraulic conductivity between 1 10 13 and 1 10 5 m s 1 which is relatively independent of soil type mitchell 1993 therefore an electrical gradient is more effective than a hydraulic gradient in moving liquid through fine grained soils 2 2 electro migration electro migration is the transport of charged ions in solution towards oppositely charged electrodes negatively charged anions will move towards the anode and positively charged cations will move towards the cathode electro migration of ions is quantified by effective ionic mobility uj effective ionic mobility can be defined as the velocity of the ion in the soil under the influence of an electrical potential gradient because there is no established method to measure the effective ionic mobility of an ion in the soil indirect methods are always adopted the ionic mobility and the diffusion coefficient of an ion in dilute solution are related by the nernst einstein equation koryta 1982 3 u j d j z j f rt τ n where dj is the diffusion coefficient of ion j in the dilute solution m2 s 1 zj is the charge of the chemical species f is faraday s constant 96487c mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature k 2 3 interpretation of the electro kinetic barrier fig 1 shows the principle configuration of an electro kinetic barrier a series of electrodes anodes and cathodes are placed perpendicular to the contaminant migration direction the electrodes are oriented in such a way that the electro osmotic flow occurs in a direction opposite to the direction of contaminant ion migration under hydraulic gradient here a simple example was used to illustrate the effectiveness of electro osmosis over the flow caused by the hydraulic gradient for instance a clayey soil has a hydraulic conductivity k h of 1 10 9 m s 1 and an electro osmotic conductivity k eo of 5 10 9 m2 v 1 s 1 assuming the volumes of pore water flow through the unit cross sectional area and the flow created by the electrical potential gradient and hydraulic gradient are equal to each other 4 k h h k eo ϕ an electrical potential gradient of 25 v m 1 is applied and the hydraulic gradient can be calculated as follows 5 h k eo k h ϕ 125 this indicates that the electro osmotic flow created by an electrical potential gradient of 25 v m 1 can oppose the water flow caused by a hydraulic gradient of 125 which is high compared to normal field conditions a small electrical potential gradient is sufficient to stop the flow due to the high hydraulic gradient encountered in field applications thus a sustained electro osmotic potential could effectively control the transport of contaminants fig 2 shows the relative migration of anions and cations under the action of an electric field the presented system has a constant concentration boundary at the cathode end the sample is assumed to be free of contaminant ions at the beginning with no electrical potential gradient applied both anions and cations are migrating from the cathode towards the anode under the concentration gradient after the voltage is applied the electrical potential gradient can affect the movement of the anion front relative to the cation front it can be seen that cation transport can be effectively controlled in the electro kinetic barrier however to control the transport of anions the polarity of the electrodes should be reversed doing so will create electro osmotic flow in the same direction as ground water flow and increase the advective migration of the contaminant electro migration of anions is from cathode to anode and is greater than the movement due to electro osmotic flow in the opposite direction under such action the transport of anions is prevented in the electro kinetic barrier 3 theoretical analysis 3 1 governing equation a schematic diagram for 1d contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier is shown in fig 3 with the anode placed at the bottom and the cathode at the top a coordinate system z with downward positive direction was adopted and the top of the soil layer was chosen as the origin of z considering the minor changes of soil properties in the electro kinetic barrier system mitchell and yeung 1991 alshawabkeh and acar 1992 1996 acar and alshawabkeh 1996 the following assumptions were made to establish the analytical model for contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier 1 the soil is homogeneous and fully saturated and the soil properties are constant over time 2 the soil deformation induced by electro osmosis is minor and can be neglected the net electro osmotic flow is always towards the cathode 3 the applied voltage is useful in the transport of water and the chemical species 4 fluid flux and ionic flux due to electro osmosis and electro migration are linear functions of electrical potential gradient and can be linearly superimposed 5 the flow caused by the thermal gradient and chemical concentration gradient is neglected and the fluid flux induced by the hydraulic gradient and electrical potential gradient remains constant over time 6 both the electrophoresis of the fine grained soil particles and the electro chemical reaction are neglected under these assumptions the equations describing the coupled flow phenomena for total fluid flux mass flux and charge flux have been given by alshawabkeh and acar 1992 the equation describing the total fluid flux can be expressed as 6 j w k h h k eo ϕ where j w is fluid flux per unit cross sectional area of saturated clays m s 1 thereafter the flux density per unit cross sectional area of porous medium jj mol m 2 s 1 of a dissolved chemical species j can be expressed as alshawabkeh and acar 1992 7 j j d j c j j w u j ϕ c j where dj m2 s 1 is the effective diffusion coefficient of the j th specie cj is the concentration of the j th specie mol m 3 due to the tortuous path of ions in the porous matrix the effect of porosity n and tortuosity τ shackelford and daniel 1991 was accounted for to give the effective diffusion coefficient as 8 d j n τ d j the tortuosity τ may span in the range 0 01 0 84 which is dependent on the characteristics of the porous medium alshawabkeh and acar 1992 the effective ion mobility has been defined in eq 3 by the nernst townsend einstein relation applying the law of mass conservation to eq 7 the mass transport of the j th contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier is given by the nernst planck equation 9 d j 2 c j z t z 2 j w u j ϕ c j z t z n r d j c j z t t where t is time r d j is the retardation factor of the soil for ion j which is determined using following equation 10 r d j 1 ρ k j n where ρ represents the dry density of the soil and k is the distribution coefficient for j th specie as described in previous literature shackelford 1990 a constant concentration of contaminant is often assumed since this will lead to a conservative result in the barrier system thus a constant concentration is also assumed at the top of the electro kinetic barrier in this study which can be described as 11 c j 0 t c 0 where c0 is the concentration of contaminant ion j in the dilute solution at the same time in conventional landfill barriers the horizontal flow velocity of groundwater is always assumed to be infinite and that once the contaminants drain out the contaminant would be instantaneously flushed away via the groundwater movement chen et al 2009 the contaminant concentration at the bottom of the electro kinetic barrier can be set as zero i e drichlet boundary condition 12 c j h t 0 when the horizontal flow velocity of groundwater is not sufficient the cauchy boundary condition might be favoured as follows 13 λ c j h t z μ c j h t 0 where λ and μ are two parameters to describe the cauchy boundary condition in general λ is a parameter proportion to the diffusion coefficient thus λ 0 under these circumstances when parameter μ is infinite the cauchy boundary condition can be degraded to the drichlet boundary condition when parameter μ is equal to zero the cauchy boundary condition can be degraded to the neumann boundary condition zero mass flux boundary in this study both analytical solutions for the drichlet and cauchy boundary conditions are presented additionally the system can be considered initially contaminant free with respect to the electro kinetic barrier after construction the initial condition can be assumed as 14 c j z 0 0 thus the simplified governing equation which could capture the main feature of the contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier and two corresponding boundary conditions and initial condition are presented in the above section 3 2 analytical solutions since the horizontal flow velocity of groundwater at the lower boundary is insufficient the cauchy boundary condition is more suitable in reality thus in the text only the cauchy boundary condition expressed in eq 13 is considered and discussed with respect to the drichlet boundary condition eq 12 the main deviation process is shown in appendix a and the solution is not discussed here initially we define two parameters as 15 a τ d j r d j 16 b j w u j ϕ n r d j substituting eqs 15 and 16 into eq 9 we can obtain following equation 17 a 2 c j z t z 2 b c j z t z c j z t t according to eq 17 a new variable w z t can be introduced as 18 w z t c j z t e b 2 a z b 2 4 a t and eq 17 can be rewritten as 19 a 2 w z t z 2 w z t t to generalize the solution two dimensionless variables are introduced as 20 z z h 21 t at h 2 from eq 15 we can see that the dimensionless time factor t in eq 21 is a function of time t coefficients of diffusion tortuosity retardation factor and the thickness of electro kinetic barrier by using eqs 20 and 21 eq 19 can be further rearranged as 22 2 w z t z 2 w z t t through corresponding transformations the cauchy boundary and initial conditions can be rewritten as follows 23 w 0 t c 0 e b 2 h 2 4 a 2 t w 1 t z λ w 1 t 0 24 w z 0 0 where 25 λ b 2 a μ λ h to derive the analytical solution of eq 22 w z t can be separated into two parts such that 26 w z t s z t f z t to satisfy the boundary condition of eq 23 the auxiliary function f z t can be defined as 27 f z t c 0 1 λ z 1 λ e b 2 h 2 4 a 2 t now eqs 22 23 and 24 can then be rewritten as 28 2 s z 2 s t f t 29 s 0 t 0 s 1 t z λ s 1 t 0 30 s z 0 c 0 1 λ z 1 λ referring to previous studies ozisik 1968 van genuchten and alves 1982 chen and liu 2011 the solution to eq 28 can be supposed to have the following form 31 s z t m 1 t m t sin β m z where 32 β m λ t a n β m by substituting eq 31 into eq 28 the following relation can be obtained 33 m 1 t m t β m 2 s i n β m z m 1 t m t s i n β m z f t because of the orthogonality of the fourier series eq 33 can be simplified to 34 t m t β m 2 t m t g t where 35 g t β m cos β m 1 λ 1 λ cos β m β m cos β m 2 β m 2 β m s i n 2 β m b 2 h 2 c 0 a 2 e b 2 h 2 4 a 2 t similarly the following equation can be derived by substituting eq 31 into the initial condition eq 30 and using the orthogonality of the

experiment to investigate the effectiveness of an electro kinetic barrier to prevent the transport of contaminant ions the results of his experiment are also presented in yeung and mitchell 1993 in their study 1d column tests were carried out for different time periods sodium chloride was selected as a contaminant in their experiment for its stability and low attenuation in soils the soil used in the experiment was a grey brown silty clay of moderate plasticity from livermore california samples were compacted at an optimum moisture content of 21 and a dry bulk density of 1 6 g cm3 sodium chloride 0 022 m was introduced to the top reservoirs of the permeameters to simulate the contaminant a hydraulic gradient of 50 was applied continuously an electrical potential gradient of 1 v cm 1 was applied across the samples for 1 h per day in a direction to create electro osmotic flow opposite to the hydraulic flow this was done by placing a cathode near the sample inlet and an anode near the sample outlet in their study one sample was sectioned for chemical analysis every 5 days sodium and chloride concentrations in each section of the soil sample were obtained by chemical analysis table 1 presents the parameters used in the proposed analytical solution which were also used in the numerical simulation by narasimhan and ranjan 2000 it should be pointed out because the samples were collected for chemical analysis at different times the data showing the ion distribution came from different samples hence the hydraulic electro osmotic conductivities porosity and tortuosity used in the analytical solution were the average values from different samples the diffusion coefficients for sodium and chloride ions were obtained from mitchell 1993 the sample length and hydraulic gradient is presented by yeung 1990 note that due to interface resistance between the cathodes and soils the effective voltage applied on the soil sample is slightly less than 1 v cm 1 it is closer to approximately 0 8 v cm 1 in addition the voltage gradient in the experiment was applied for 1 h per day but the voltage gradient was assumed to be constant over time in the proposed analytical solutions considering the changes of effective voltage gradient and electro osmotic flux are minor by using intermittent current micic et al 2001 an average voltage is defined based on the principle of equal transport quantity for pore water and ions 39 k eo u j ϕ 0 h t s k eo u j ϕ avg h t imt ϕ avg t s t imt ϕ 0 where ϕ 0 is the effective voltage applied on the electro kinetic barrier ϕ avg is the average voltage ts is the time for sustained dc voltage applied each time and timt is the interval period therefore the average voltage gradient is determined as 3 75 v m in the calculation 4 2 comparison between experimental and numerical results in the experiments sodium and chloride migrated from the anode end could not be flushed away completely so the analytical solution considering the cauchy boundary condition was used for comparison the value of μ λ was chosen as 10 figs 4 and 5 present the analytical predicted distributions of sodium and chloride with experimental and numerical results at different times the figures show that the result of the proposed analytical solution agrees with the experimental and numerical results from previous studies yeung 1990 narasimhan and ranjan 2000 which indicates the validity and reasonability of the proposed analytical solution and the equivalent method to determine the average voltage gradient note that the destructive chemical analyses of the samples lead to the loss of the sample at the end of each experimental period therefore the data for 10 days comes from a different sample than the data for 25 days since it is difficult to uniformly pack soil columns it is inevitable that packing variations can result in the differences in initial concentrations thus the soil parameters of all the samples were averaged before being used for simulations it was found that there is a relatively large difference between the analytical solution and experimental data however the difference between the analytical solution and numerical solution is small which may be caused by ignoring changes of soil parameters and soil deformation to derive the analytical solution in general the capability of the proposed analytical solution to predict the transport of the contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier is confirmed according to the comparison results as shown in fig 4 when a hydraulic gradient of 50 was imposed from the cathode to the anode the sodium ions moved towards the anode by advection and diffusion both the sodium and chloride ions have migrated considerably towards the anode under the action of hydraulic gradient merely however when the voltage gradient was applied to the electro kinetic barrier the migration of sodium ions from the cathode to the anode was significantly slowed even after 25 days fig 5 shows the distributions of the chloride ions at different times it was found except in the case of hydraulic gradient action the prevailing electro migration will tend to promote the transport of negatively charged chloride ions from the cathode towards the anode moreover the electro migration of chloride ions is dominant over the movement due to the counter flow created by electro osmosis in this case the migration rate of chloride ions from the cathode towards the anode was enhanced by applying the voltage gradient therefore if the contaminant of interest consists of negatively charged ions the barrier cathodes arrangement in fig 1 should be reversed furthermore if the contaminants include both negatively and positively charged ions an additional row of cathodes should be installed below the anodes 5 parameter study in this section the parameter study was conducted using the proposed analytics to analyse the transport of lead ions pb ii in the electro kinetic barriers the diffusion coefficient and mobility of pb ii were taken from kim et al 2004 the constant concentration of pb ii at the top boundary c 0 was assumed to be 2 0 g l the porosity and tortuosity of the soil were set as 0 48 and 0 4 respectively the hydraulic and electro osmotic conductivities were assumed to be 1 0 10 11 m s 1 and 3 0 10 9 m2 v 1 s 1 respectively the retardation factor was set as 1 0 the basic calculation parameters required in the analytical solutions are given in table 2 the influence of the average voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient retardation factor and electro osmotic conductivity on the transport process of contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier was studied 5 1 effect of average voltage gradient hydraulic conductivity and electro osmotic conductivity such that kh 1 10 7 cm s and keo 5 10 5 cm2 v 1 s 1 for typical compacted clay liner materials the required sustained dc voltage across a liner of typical thickness would be of the order of a few tenths of a volt mitchell and yeung 1991 considering this five different values of average voltage gradient ϕ avg i e 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 v m were considered to investigate the effect of varying voltages on pb ii transport within the electro kinetic barrier while the other parameters remained the same as those in table 2 the value of μ λ was chosen as 10 m 1 for the case of ϕ avg 0 there is no dc voltage applied to impede diffusive migration of the contaminant in this case contaminant transport is only induced by diffusion and convection under the hydraulic gradient and the base contaminant concentration reaches 90 of c0 at t 0 28 corresponding to approximately 94 years fig 6 shows a series of contaminant breakthrough curves in terms of the base relative concentration c b c 0 with respect to five different average voltage gradients it can be found that the base contaminant concentration decreases significantly with the increase of average voltage gradient and the time required to reach the steady state is shortened it is can be seen that the final base relative concentration reduces to c b f c 0 7 32 10 3 when ϕ avg 0 5 v m which is much smaller than c b f c 0 1 0 without dc voltage applied furthermore when voltage gradient increases to 2 v m the value of c b f c 0 decreases to 2 0 10 6 fig 7 shows the relationship between the final base relative concentration and average voltage gradient there is a linear relationship found between log c b f c 0 and ϕ avg except when ϕ avg 0 5 v m thus by using this relation the value of the average voltage gradient can be determined as 0 9 v m in this case when assuming the breakthrough criterion as c b f c 0 1 0 10 3 if the dc voltage is intermittently applied in the field application with the applied voltage gradient 50 v m and sustained for 1 h each time the interval period can be determined as 56 h by using eq 39 the influence of average voltage gradient on the mass flux at the bottom of the electro kinetic barrier is shown in fig 8 similar to changes in relative base concentration the bottom mass flux decreases with increasing average voltage gradient and the time to reach the steady state decreases with increasing average voltage gradient for instance when the average voltage gradient is 0 5 v m the 100 year t 0 298 mass flux at the bottom of the electro kinetic barrier decreases to 14 of that 7 53 107 mg ha year without dc voltage applied furthermore as the average voltage gradient increases from 0 5 v m to 2 0 v m the bottom mass flux decreases by a factor of 3690 in general the bottom mass flux for the conventional composite liners is usually within 103 and 106 mg ha year rowe et al 2000 thus when the average voltage gradient is within the 1 0 to 2 0 v m the migration of pb ii in the electro kinetic barrier can be effectively prevented 5 2 effect of thickness of electro kinetic barrier to investigate the influence of the barrier thickness on the transport process of pb ii in the electro kinetic barrier five thickness values h i e 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m 2 0 m and 2 5 m were considered in this analysis the average voltage gradient was fixed as 1 0 v m while the other parameters were kept the same as values in table 2 the value of μ λ was set as 10 m 1 fig 9 shows the contaminant breakthrough curves in terms of base relative concentration with respect to different barrier thicknesses as barrier thickness increases from 0 5 m to 2 5 m a decreasing relative base contaminant concentration can be observed thicker compacted clayey soil layers showed greater contaminant retention and smaller final relative base contaminant concentration additionally it is apparent that the time required to achieve the same base contaminant concentration increases significantly with increasing thickness thus the increase of the barrier thickness can not only decrease the final base contaminant concentration but also prolong the breakthrough time therefore by using thicker electro kinetic barrier the average applied voltage gradient can be reduced and the interval time for the intermittent current can also be prolonged fig 10 presents the relation curves between the final base relative concentration and barrier thickness under four different average voltage gradients the linear relationship is satisfied between log c b f c 0 and h thus it is possible either to select the barrier thickness or the average voltage gradient in the design of electro kinetic barriers by using this chart once the soil properties and breakthrough criterion is determined if breakthrough criterion is selected as c b f c 0 10 3 the barrier thickness 1 0 m can be determined with an average voltage gradient of 2 0 v m similarly if electro kinetic barrier thickness is designed to be 1 5 m the average voltage gradient can be determined as 1 25 v m through fig 10 to give the deeper insights a dimensionless factor will be defined in the next section 5 3 effect of diffusion coefficient fig 11 presents the influence of a diffusion coefficient i e 9 45 10 10 18 9 10 10 5 0 10 9 and 9 45 10 9 m2 s 1 on the changes of base concentration over time in this analysis the value of μ λ was set as 10 m 1 the average voltage and barrier thickness was the same as the values in table 2 it should be pointed out that the ionic mobility changes proportionally with the diffusion coefficient as eq 3 as shown in fig 11 a nonlinear increase of the relative base concentration can be found with the increase of diffusion coefficient using the diffusion coefficient dpb2 9 45 10 10 m2 s 1 as the comparison the final base concentration increases by a factor of approximately 43 1 when the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 5 29 nevertheless the final base concentration increases by a factor of 58 9 as the diffusion coefficient increases 10 times in addition the time to reach a steady state decreases with an increase in diffusion coefficient therefore for the contaminant ions with high diffusion coefficients a larger average voltage gradient is necessary to improve the electro kinetic effect 5 4 effect of retardation factor the sorption capacity of the soil barrier is represented by the value of the retardation factor rd a larger rd will yield a higher sorption capacity for the compacted soil layer of the electro kinetic barrier fig 12 shows the influence of the four different retardation factors i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 on the development of the base concentration over time the figure shows that the retardation factor has little influence on the curves between the relative base concentration and dimensionless time factor t the final base concentrations of different retardation factors approach a similar value however considering the time factor t defined in eq 21 the retardation factor has an obvious influence on the real time required to reach the steady state for example when taking the time for the base concentration arriving at 0 01 of c0 as the breakthrough time the breakthrough time increases from 9 years to 26 years as retardation factor increases from 1 0 to 2 0 from this analysis the time to break through the electro kinetic barrier can be effectively prolonged by using clayey soils with a high sorption capacity 5 5 effect of electro osmotic conductivity to study the influence of electro osmosis on the transport of pb ii in the electro kinetic barrier four ratios of electro osmotic conductivity to diffusion coefficient keo dpb2 0 1 1 0 5 0 10 with dpb2 9 45 10 10 m2 s 1 were set in this analysis where the average voltage gradient was 1 0 v m and the barrier thickness was 2 m the other parameters were held the same as those in table 2 fig 13 presents the relationship between the final relative base concentration and value of keo dpb2 in the double logarithmiccoordinate system the final relative base concentration decreases with the increase of electro osmotic conductivity although the final base relative concentration decreases significantly as the value of keo dpb2 increases from 0 1 to 1 0 it still changes within the order of 10 2 which is larger than the breakthrough criterion set at 10 5 however as the value of keo dpb2 increases to 1 0 the final relative base concentration decreases significantly with the increase of electro osmotic conductivity the final relative base concentration decreases from the order of 10 2 to 10 5 as the value of keo dpb2 increases from 1 0 to 5 0 and further to 10 9 as the value of keo dpb2 reaches 10 thus we defined a concept of diffusion degree of contaminant migration u c by dividing the base concentration by its final steady value fig 14 gives the diffusion degree curves for contaminant migration with different electro osmotic conductivities time to reach the steady state can be shortened with the increase of electro osmotic conductivity nevertheless when the value of keo dpb2 is less than 1 0 the diffusion degrees of contaminant migration in the electro kinetic barrier are almost equal therefore with respect to the soil with relatively large electro osmotic conductivity the influence of electro osmosis on the transport of contaminant ions is considerable which is an important consideration in the design 5 6 normalized treatment and analysis to achieve deeper insights into the previously mentioned influence factors we introduce a dimensionless factor x as 40 χ d j k eo δ ϕ k h δ h h by using this equation the dimensionless factors corresponding to the varying average voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient and electro osmotic conductivity in the previous analysis can be calculated then the relationship between the final relative base concentration and the dimensionless factor x can be plotted note that the larger value of diffusion coefficient will lead to a larger χ while a larger value of electro osmotic velocity and barrier thickness will lead to a decrease in χ thus the large value of χ represents rapid contaminant migration while a small value of χ represents the slow contaminant migration fig 15 presents the relationship curve between the final relative base concentration and dimensionless factor χ in the double logarithmic coordinate system as expected the base concentration at the steady state increases with the increase of dimensionless factor χ in the double logarithmic coordinate system this means that a larger quantity of contaminant will pass through the electro kinetic barrier at the steady state with respect to the larger χ in addition it can be seen that the predicted points with varying influence factors are slightly decreasing in a narrow strip with little discreteness through curve fitting an exponential growth relationship can be used to describe the relationship between the final relative base concentration and the dimensionless factor χ in the double logarithmic coordinate system the function is given as 41 l o g c b f c 0 a 1 e x p l o g χ b 1 d 1 where a1 b1 and d1 are fitting parameters thus by using this equation the value of χ can be calculated once the

through electro kinetic barrier are presented in this paper two different bottom boundary conditions i e cauchy boundary and a fixed zero concentration boundary conditions were considered the results of the proposed analytical solution agree with experimental and numerical results 2 the average applied voltage gradient and barrier thickness have a significant influence on the contaminant ion transport within the electro kinetic barriers the final concentration and mass flux at the bottom boundary decrease with increases in the average voltage gradient and barrier thickness the logarithm of final relative base concentration changes linearly with the changes of average voltage gradient and barrier thickness 3 the diffusion coefficient of the contaminant ions and the sorption capacity of the clayey soil also have a distinct influence on the transport of contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barriers the final base concentration increases nonlinearly with the increase of ion s diffusion coefficient the soil sorption capacity has little influence on the final base concentration but the breakthrough time of the electro kinetic barrier can be effectively prolonged by using clayey soils with a high sorption capacity 4 the influence of electro osmosis is important to be considered in the design of electro kinetic barriers with an increase in the electro osmotic conductivity the final base concentration and the time required to reach the steady state decrease especially when the value of electro osmotic conductivity excesses is larger than the value of diffusion coefficient 5 a dimensionless factor χ is proposed which can be suggested as an important parameter for design which can be used to determine the soil properties average voltage gradient and barrier thickness with the given breakthrough criterion exponential growth function can be used to fit the relation curve between the final base relative concentration and χ in the double logarithmic

4659,to prevent contaminant ions from spreading over the adjacent environment it is of great interest to consider using electro kinetic barriers to counteract contaminant transport through the combined effects of electro osmosis and electro migration in this study considering the bottom surface as a cauchy boundary or a drichlet boundary condition two analytical solutions are proposed to predict the contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier analytical solutions are verified against experimental data and numerical solutions from the previous literature subsequently the proposed analytical solutions are used to investigate the effects of average applied voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient retardation factor and electro osmotic conductivity on the transport of contaminant through the electro kinetic barrier the results show that the steady state base contaminant concentration decreases with the increase in average voltage gradient and barrier thickness additionally the logarithm of the final stable base contaminant concentration changes linearly with the average applied voltage gradient and barrier thickness for the contaminants with a high diffusion coefficient a larger average voltage gradient should be applied to improve the electro kinetic effects clayey soils with high sorption capacity and relatively high electro osmotic conductivity are the suggested material choice for constructing compacted soil liners within the electro kinetic barrier due to distinct advantages in contaminant migration prevention finally a dimensionless factor is introduced to uniformly describe influences on the base relative concentration and it can be used as an important parameter for the design of an electro kinetic barrier keywords analytical solution electro kinetic barrier contaminant migration parameter study 1 introduction improper disposal and accidental spillage of toxic and hazardous chemicals from domestic agricultural and industrial activities have led to significant soil contamination creating an urgent need to find feasible solutions to the problem containment barrier technology such as slurry walls sheet pile cut off walls and grout curtains is an effective method to protect the soil and ground water from potential contamination acar and haider 1990 however these containment technologies are relatively expensive and time consuming to construct and may require the use of specialized equipment the availability of suitable access for machinery and large equipment to reach the contaminated site has become a major limitation for the application of these conventional techniques in some situations narasimhan and ranjan 2000 moreover the long term behaviour of these conventional barriers under the interaction of compacted soil liners and contaminant ions is also an issue that should be addressed electro kinetic remediation is an emerging in situ method in which contaminants are mobilized and eventually recovered by passing a low current intensity between a row of anode and cathode electrodes inserted in the ground acar and alshawabkeh 1993 acar et al 1995 yeung et al 1997 mulligan et al 2001 page and page 2002 this application exploits the transport processes of ions in solution by electro osmosis and electro migration electro osmosis is the movement of water that results from an applied electric gradient while electro migration is the movement of ions in solution in an electric field by using electro osmosis and electro migration the idea of creating an electro kinetic barrier was conceived by lageman et al 1989 and successfully used to prevent the migration of heavy metal contaminants such as lead copper zinc and cadmium during the remediation of an abandoned paint factory godschalk and lageman 2005 as shown in fig 1 the idea underlying the use of an electro kinetic barrier to prevent contaminant migration is simple a counter gradient opposite to the direction of the groundwater gradient is created by a continuous or periodic application of an electrical potential difference between the electrodes which halts the movement of water within that region and effectively prevents the migration of contaminants yeung 1990 mitchell and yeung 1991 lynch et al 2007 although the concept was proposed some time ago little work on the calculation method of the electro kinetic barrier has been carried out it is now necessary to develop an effective calculation method to predict the transport of contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier for design convenience and field applications of this method considering four transport processes in the electro kinetic system namely electro migration diffusion electro osmosis and advective flow under hydraulic gradients acar and alshawabkeh 1993 shapiro and probstein 1993 acar et al 1995 yeung et al 1997 several numerical models have been developed for the predication of contaminant ion transport in electro kinetic extraction and remediation choi and lui 1995 alshawabkeh and acar 1996 mattson et al 2002 kim et al 2003 2004 amrate et al 2005 al hamdan and reddy 2008 paz garcía et al 2011 masi et al 2017 meanwhile yeung and mitchell 1993 have developed a general coupled flow theory for the electro kinetic barrier on the basis of the formalism of non equilibrium thermodynamics for analysis of the physics involved in the transport processes narasimhan and ranjan 2000 presented a numerical model that could predict the changes in ph pore water pressure and the voltage gradient along the length of the electro kinetic barrier numerical models play an important role in the prediction of contaminant transport in electro kinetic remediation systems but the level of numerical sophistication often greatly exceeds the sophistication of the available data especially at the site selection and preliminary design stages and the cost in terms of man hours of a detailed numerical analysis with the necessary checks on discretization error may not be justifiable under the circumstances rowe and nadarajah 1997 thus simplified analytical methods can provide an economic and efficient alternative to complex numerical models in many ways although rigorous restricted conditions are required in the field of conventional landfill barrier system analytical methods have generally been used since they can readily analyse the sensitivity of each individual parameter in question chen et al 2009 developed an analytical solution for 1d contaminant diffusion through a multi layered landfill barrier system to investigate the effects of the half life of contaminants on the solute flux of benzene diffused into the underlying aquifer considering arbitrary initial conditions subsequently a series of analytical studies regarding the diffusion of contaminants in landfill barriers have been conducted by considering different combinations of fixed solute concentrations and zero flux boundary conditions degradation effects of the organic contaminants sorption convection and unsaturated soils beneath the barrier system li and cleall 2010 xie et al 2013 zhao and burns 2013 zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2019 these analytical studies can provide the indications necessary to provide analytical solutions for the transport of contaminant ions in electro kinetic barriers the objective of this paper is to present a 1d analytical model capable of predicting contaminant ion transport in electro kinetic barriers considering the combined effect of concentration gradient hydraulic gradient electro osmosis and electro migration these analytical solutions are subjected to the cauchy boundary and drichlet boundary conditions respectively the proposed analytical solutions were validated by comparison with experimental and numerical results presented in previous literature finally using the proposed analytical solutions a parametric study was performed to investigate the influences of an average applied voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient retardation factor and electro osmotic conductivity on the contaminant ion migration in the electro kinetic barrier 2 theoretical background in this study we considered diffusion electro osmosis and electro migration as the main transport mechanisms for contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier since colloid migration is hindered by the immobile phase of the porous medium yu and neretnieks 1997 electrophoresis was neglected 2 1 electro osmosis electro osmosis is the movement of the pore water due to the viscous drag of the cations the negative charge on the surface of most soil particles will cause an accumulation of positively charged cations near the surface thus under an electrical potential gradient the pore water will be dragged by the cations and the net movement of the pore water will be towards the cathode the electro osmotic flow rate can be expressed by the following formulation 1 q eo k eo ϕ where q eo is electro osmotic flux m s 1 ϕ is electrical voltage gradient v m 1 and k eo is electro osmotic conductivity m2 v 1 s 1 which depends on several variables according to the hemlholtz smoluchowski theory it can be related to zeta potential ξ v and the dielectric constant ε 8 854 10 12 f m 1 and the viscosity η 1 10 3 ns m 2 of the fluid eykholt and daniel 1994 2 k eo ε ξ η n τ where the negative sign indicates that negatively charged particles produce an electro osmotic flow directed from anode to cathode the tortuosity τ and porosity n terms in eq 2 were introduced by casagrande 1949 to include the porous matrix effects in the original hemlholtz smoluchowski formulation in general the values of electro osmotic conductivity fall in the narrow range between 1 10 9 and 1 10 8 m2 v 1 s 1 compared with the values of hydraulic conductivity between 1 10 13 and 1 10 5 m s 1 which is relatively independent of soil type mitchell 1993 therefore an electrical gradient is more effective than a hydraulic gradient in moving liquid through fine grained soils 2 2 electro migration electro migration is the transport of charged ions in solution towards oppositely charged electrodes negatively charged anions will move towards the anode and positively charged cations will move towards the cathode electro migration of ions is quantified by effective ionic mobility uj effective ionic mobility can be defined as the velocity of the ion in the soil under the influence of an electrical potential gradient because there is no established method to measure the effective ionic mobility of an ion in the soil indirect methods are always adopted the ionic mobility and the diffusion coefficient of an ion in dilute solution are related by the nernst einstein equation koryta 1982 3 u j d j z j f rt τ n where dj is the diffusion coefficient of ion j in the dilute solution m2 s 1 zj is the charge of the chemical species f is faraday s constant 96487c mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature k 2 3 interpretation of the electro kinetic barrier fig 1 shows the principle configuration of an electro kinetic barrier a series of electrodes anodes and cathodes are placed perpendicular to the contaminant migration direction the electrodes are oriented in such a way that the electro osmotic flow occurs in a direction opposite to the direction of contaminant ion migration under hydraulic gradient here a simple example was used to illustrate the effectiveness of electro osmosis over the flow caused by the hydraulic gradient for instance a clayey soil has a hydraulic conductivity k h of 1 10 9 m s 1 and an electro osmotic conductivity k eo of 5 10 9 m2 v 1 s 1 assuming the volumes of pore water flow through the unit cross sectional area and the flow created by the electrical potential gradient and hydraulic gradient are equal to each other 4 k h h k eo ϕ an electrical potential gradient of 25 v m 1 is applied and the hydraulic gradient can be calculated as follows 5 h k eo k h ϕ 125 this indicates that the electro osmotic flow created by an electrical potential gradient of 25 v m 1 can oppose the water flow caused by a hydraulic gradient of 125 which is high compared to normal field conditions a small electrical potential gradient is sufficient to stop the flow due to the high hydraulic gradient encountered in field applications thus a sustained electro osmotic potential could effectively control the transport of contaminants fig 2 shows the relative migration of anions and cations under the action of an electric field the presented system has a constant concentration boundary at the cathode end the sample is assumed to be free of contaminant ions at the beginning with no electrical potential gradient applied both anions and cations are migrating from the cathode towards the anode under the concentration gradient after the voltage is applied the electrical potential gradient can affect the movement of the anion front relative to the cation front it can be seen that cation transport can be effectively controlled in the electro kinetic barrier however to control the transport of anions the polarity of the electrodes should be reversed doing so will create electro osmotic flow in the same direction as ground water flow and increase the advective migration of the contaminant electro migration of anions is from cathode to anode and is greater than the movement due to electro osmotic flow in the opposite direction under such action the transport of anions is prevented in the electro kinetic barrier 3 theoretical analysis 3 1 governing equation a schematic diagram for 1d contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier is shown in fig 3 with the anode placed at the bottom and the cathode at the top a coordinate system z with downward positive direction was adopted and the top of the soil layer was chosen as the origin of z considering the minor changes of soil properties in the electro kinetic barrier system mitchell and yeung 1991 alshawabkeh and acar 1992 1996 acar and alshawabkeh 1996 the following assumptions were made to establish the analytical model for contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier 1 the soil is homogeneous and fully saturated and the soil properties are constant over time 2 the soil deformation induced by electro osmosis is minor and can be neglected the net electro osmotic flow is always towards the cathode 3 the applied voltage is useful in the transport of water and the chemical species 4 fluid flux and ionic flux due to electro osmosis and electro migration are linear functions of electrical potential gradient and can be linearly superimposed 5 the flow caused by the thermal gradient and chemical concentration gradient is neglected and the fluid flux induced by the hydraulic gradient and electrical potential gradient remains constant over time 6 both the electrophoresis of the fine grained soil particles and the electro chemical reaction are neglected under these assumptions the equations describing the coupled flow phenomena for total fluid flux mass flux and charge flux have been given by alshawabkeh and acar 1992 the equation describing the total fluid flux can be expressed as 6 j w k h h k eo ϕ where j w is fluid flux per unit cross sectional area of saturated clays m s 1 thereafter the flux density per unit cross sectional area of porous medium jj mol m 2 s 1 of a dissolved chemical species j can be expressed as alshawabkeh and acar 1992 7 j j d j c j j w u j ϕ c j where dj m2 s 1 is the effective diffusion coefficient of the j th specie cj is the concentration of the j th specie mol m 3 due to the tortuous path of ions in the porous matrix the effect of porosity n and tortuosity τ shackelford and daniel 1991 was accounted for to give the effective diffusion coefficient as 8 d j n τ d j the tortuosity τ may span in the range 0 01 0 84 which is dependent on the characteristics of the porous medium alshawabkeh and acar 1992 the effective ion mobility has been defined in eq 3 by the nernst townsend einstein relation applying the law of mass conservation to eq 7 the mass transport of the j th contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier is given by the nernst planck equation 9 d j 2 c j z t z 2 j w u j ϕ c j z t z n r d j c j z t t where t is time r d j is the retardation factor of the soil for ion j which is determined using following equation 10 r d j 1 ρ k j n where ρ represents the dry density of the soil and k is the distribution coefficient for j th specie as described in previous literature shackelford 1990 a constant concentration of contaminant is often assumed since this will lead to a conservative result in the barrier system thus a constant concentration is also assumed at the top of the electro kinetic barrier in this study which can be described as 11 c j 0 t c 0 where c0 is the concentration of contaminant ion j in the dilute solution at the same time in conventional landfill barriers the horizontal flow velocity of groundwater is always assumed to be infinite and that once the contaminants drain out the contaminant would be instantaneously flushed away via the groundwater movement chen et al 2009 the contaminant concentration at the bottom of the electro kinetic barrier can be set as zero i e drichlet boundary condition 12 c j h t 0 when the horizontal flow velocity of groundwater is not sufficient the cauchy boundary condition might be favoured as follows 13 λ c j h t z μ c j h t 0 where λ and μ are two parameters to describe the cauchy boundary condition in general λ is a parameter proportion to the diffusion coefficient thus λ 0 under these circumstances when parameter μ is infinite the cauchy boundary condition can be degraded to the drichlet boundary condition when parameter μ is equal to zero the cauchy boundary condition can be degraded to the neumann boundary condition zero mass flux boundary in this study both analytical solutions for the drichlet and cauchy boundary conditions are presented additionally the system can be considered initially contaminant free with respect to the electro kinetic barrier after construction the initial condition can be assumed as 14 c j z 0 0 thus the simplified governing equation which could capture the main feature of the contaminant ion transport in the electro kinetic barrier and two corresponding boundary conditions and initial condition are presented in the above section 3 2 analytical solutions since the horizontal flow velocity of groundwater at the lower boundary is insufficient the cauchy boundary condition is more suitable in reality thus in the text only the cauchy boundary condition expressed in eq 13 is considered and discussed with respect to the drichlet boundary condition eq 12 the main deviation process is shown in appendix a and the solution is not discussed here initially we define two parameters as 15 a τ d j r d j 16 b j w u j ϕ n r d j substituting eqs 15 and 16 into eq 9 we can obtain following equation 17 a 2 c j z t z 2 b c j z t z c j z t t according to eq 17 a new variable w z t can be introduced as 18 w z t c j z t e b 2 a z b 2 4 a t and eq 17 can be rewritten as 19 a 2 w z t z 2 w z t t to generalize the solution two dimensionless variables are introduced as 20 z z h 21 t at h 2 from eq 15 we can see that the dimensionless time factor t in eq 21 is a function of time t coefficients of diffusion tortuosity retardation factor and the thickness of electro kinetic barrier by using eqs 20 and 21 eq 19 can be further rearranged as 22 2 w z t z 2 w z t t through corresponding transformations the cauchy boundary and initial conditions can be rewritten as follows 23 w 0 t c 0 e b 2 h 2 4 a 2 t w 1 t z λ w 1 t 0 24 w z 0 0 where 25 λ b 2 a μ λ h to derive the analytical solution of eq 22 w z t can be separated into two parts such that 26 w z t s z t f z t to satisfy the boundary condition of eq 23 the auxiliary function f z t can be defined as 27 f z t c 0 1 λ z 1 λ e b 2 h 2 4 a 2 t now eqs 22 23 and 24 can then be rewritten as 28 2 s z 2 s t f t 29 s 0 t 0 s 1 t z λ s 1 t 0 30 s z 0 c 0 1 λ z 1 λ referring to previous studies ozisik 1968 van genuchten and alves 1982 chen and liu 2011 the solution to eq 28 can be supposed to have the following form 31 s z t m 1 t m t sin β m z where 32 β m λ t a n β m by substituting eq 31 into eq 28 the following relation can be obtained 33 m 1 t m t β m 2 s i n β m z m 1 t m t s i n β m z f t because of the orthogonality of the fourier series eq 33 can be simplified to 34 t m t β m 2 t m t g t where 35 g t β m cos β m 1 λ 1 λ cos β m β m cos β m 2 β m 2 β m s i n 2 β m b 2 h 2 c 0 a 2 e b 2 h 2 4 a 2 t similarly the following equation can be derived by substituting eq 31 into the initial condition eq 30 and using the orthogonality of the

experiment to investigate the effectiveness of an electro kinetic barrier to prevent the transport of contaminant ions the results of his experiment are also presented in yeung and mitchell 1993 in their study 1d column tests were carried out for different time periods sodium chloride was selected as a contaminant in their experiment for its stability and low attenuation in soils the soil used in the experiment was a grey brown silty clay of moderate plasticity from livermore california samples were compacted at an optimum moisture content of 21 and a dry bulk density of 1 6 g cm3 sodium chloride 0 022 m was introduced to the top reservoirs of the permeameters to simulate the contaminant a hydraulic gradient of 50 was applied continuously an electrical potential gradient of 1 v cm 1 was applied across the samples for 1 h per day in a direction to create electro osmotic flow opposite to the hydraulic flow this was done by placing a cathode near the sample inlet and an anode near the sample outlet in their study one sample was sectioned for chemical analysis every 5 days sodium and chloride concentrations in each section of the soil sample were obtained by chemical analysis table 1 presents the parameters used in the proposed analytical solution which were also used in the numerical simulation by narasimhan and ranjan 2000 it should be pointed out because the samples were collected for chemical analysis at different times the data showing the ion distribution came from different samples hence the hydraulic electro osmotic conductivities porosity and tortuosity used in the analytical solution were the average values from different samples the diffusion coefficients for sodium and chloride ions were obtained from mitchell 1993 the sample length and hydraulic gradient is presented by yeung 1990 note that due to interface resistance between the cathodes and soils the effective voltage applied on the soil sample is slightly less than 1 v cm 1 it is closer to approximately 0 8 v cm 1 in addition the voltage gradient in the experiment was applied for 1 h per day but the voltage gradient was assumed to be constant over time in the proposed analytical solutions considering the changes of effective voltage gradient and electro osmotic flux are minor by using intermittent current micic et al 2001 an average voltage is defined based on the principle of equal transport quantity for pore water and ions 39 k eo u j ϕ 0 h t s k eo u j ϕ avg h t imt ϕ avg t s t imt ϕ 0 where ϕ 0 is the effective voltage applied on the electro kinetic barrier ϕ avg is the average voltage ts is the time for sustained dc voltage applied each time and timt is the interval period therefore the average voltage gradient is determined as 3 75 v m in the calculation 4 2 comparison between experimental and numerical results in the experiments sodium and chloride migrated from the anode end could not be flushed away completely so the analytical solution considering the cauchy boundary condition was used for comparison the value of μ λ was chosen as 10 figs 4 and 5 present the analytical predicted distributions of sodium and chloride with experimental and numerical results at different times the figures show that the result of the proposed analytical solution agrees with the experimental and numerical results from previous studies yeung 1990 narasimhan and ranjan 2000 which indicates the validity and reasonability of the proposed analytical solution and the equivalent method to determine the average voltage gradient note that the destructive chemical analyses of the samples lead to the loss of the sample at the end of each experimental period therefore the data for 10 days comes from a different sample than the data for 25 days since it is difficult to uniformly pack soil columns it is inevitable that packing variations can result in the differences in initial concentrations thus the soil parameters of all the samples were averaged before being used for simulations it was found that there is a relatively large difference between the analytical solution and experimental data however the difference between the analytical solution and numerical solution is small which may be caused by ignoring changes of soil parameters and soil deformation to derive the analytical solution in general the capability of the proposed analytical solution to predict the transport of the contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier is confirmed according to the comparison results as shown in fig 4 when a hydraulic gradient of 50 was imposed from the cathode to the anode the sodium ions moved towards the anode by advection and diffusion both the sodium and chloride ions have migrated considerably towards the anode under the action of hydraulic gradient merely however when the voltage gradient was applied to the electro kinetic barrier the migration of sodium ions from the cathode to the anode was significantly slowed even after 25 days fig 5 shows the distributions of the chloride ions at different times it was found except in the case of hydraulic gradient action the prevailing electro migration will tend to promote the transport of negatively charged chloride ions from the cathode towards the anode moreover the electro migration of chloride ions is dominant over the movement due to the counter flow created by electro osmosis in this case the migration rate of chloride ions from the cathode towards the anode was enhanced by applying the voltage gradient therefore if the contaminant of interest consists of negatively charged ions the barrier cathodes arrangement in fig 1 should be reversed furthermore if the contaminants include both negatively and positively charged ions an additional row of cathodes should be installed below the anodes 5 parameter study in this section the parameter study was conducted using the proposed analytics to analyse the transport of lead ions pb ii in the electro kinetic barriers the diffusion coefficient and mobility of pb ii were taken from kim et al 2004 the constant concentration of pb ii at the top boundary c 0 was assumed to be 2 0 g l the porosity and tortuosity of the soil were set as 0 48 and 0 4 respectively the hydraulic and electro osmotic conductivities were assumed to be 1 0 10 11 m s 1 and 3 0 10 9 m2 v 1 s 1 respectively the retardation factor was set as 1 0 the basic calculation parameters required in the analytical solutions are given in table 2 the influence of the average voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient retardation factor and electro osmotic conductivity on the transport process of contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barrier was studied 5 1 effect of average voltage gradient hydraulic conductivity and electro osmotic conductivity such that kh 1 10 7 cm s and keo 5 10 5 cm2 v 1 s 1 for typical compacted clay liner materials the required sustained dc voltage across a liner of typical thickness would be of the order of a few tenths of a volt mitchell and yeung 1991 considering this five different values of average voltage gradient ϕ avg i e 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 v m were considered to investigate the effect of varying voltages on pb ii transport within the electro kinetic barrier while the other parameters remained the same as those in table 2 the value of μ λ was chosen as 10 m 1 for the case of ϕ avg 0 there is no dc voltage applied to impede diffusive migration of the contaminant in this case contaminant transport is only induced by diffusion and convection under the hydraulic gradient and the base contaminant concentration reaches 90 of c0 at t 0 28 corresponding to approximately 94 years fig 6 shows a series of contaminant breakthrough curves in terms of the base relative concentration c b c 0 with respect to five different average voltage gradients it can be found that the base contaminant concentration decreases significantly with the increase of average voltage gradient and the time required to reach the steady state is shortened it is can be seen that the final base relative concentration reduces to c b f c 0 7 32 10 3 when ϕ avg 0 5 v m which is much smaller than c b f c 0 1 0 without dc voltage applied furthermore when voltage gradient increases to 2 v m the value of c b f c 0 decreases to 2 0 10 6 fig 7 shows the relationship between the final base relative concentration and average voltage gradient there is a linear relationship found between log c b f c 0 and ϕ avg except when ϕ avg 0 5 v m thus by using this relation the value of the average voltage gradient can be determined as 0 9 v m in this case when assuming the breakthrough criterion as c b f c 0 1 0 10 3 if the dc voltage is intermittently applied in the field application with the applied voltage gradient 50 v m and sustained for 1 h each time the interval period can be determined as 56 h by using eq 39 the influence of average voltage gradient on the mass flux at the bottom of the electro kinetic barrier is shown in fig 8 similar to changes in relative base concentration the bottom mass flux decreases with increasing average voltage gradient and the time to reach the steady state decreases with increasing average voltage gradient for instance when the average voltage gradient is 0 5 v m the 100 year t 0 298 mass flux at the bottom of the electro kinetic barrier decreases to 14 of that 7 53 107 mg ha year without dc voltage applied furthermore as the average voltage gradient increases from 0 5 v m to 2 0 v m the bottom mass flux decreases by a factor of 3690 in general the bottom mass flux for the conventional composite liners is usually within 103 and 106 mg ha year rowe et al 2000 thus when the average voltage gradient is within the 1 0 to 2 0 v m the migration of pb ii in the electro kinetic barrier can be effectively prevented 5 2 effect of thickness of electro kinetic barrier to investigate the influence of the barrier thickness on the transport process of pb ii in the electro kinetic barrier five thickness values h i e 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m 2 0 m and 2 5 m were considered in this analysis the average voltage gradient was fixed as 1 0 v m while the other parameters were kept the same as values in table 2 the value of μ λ was set as 10 m 1 fig 9 shows the contaminant breakthrough curves in terms of base relative concentration with respect to different barrier thicknesses as barrier thickness increases from 0 5 m to 2 5 m a decreasing relative base contaminant concentration can be observed thicker compacted clayey soil layers showed greater contaminant retention and smaller final relative base contaminant concentration additionally it is apparent that the time required to achieve the same base contaminant concentration increases significantly with increasing thickness thus the increase of the barrier thickness can not only decrease the final base contaminant concentration but also prolong the breakthrough time therefore by using thicker electro kinetic barrier the average applied voltage gradient can be reduced and the interval time for the intermittent current can also be prolonged fig 10 presents the relation curves between the final base relative concentration and barrier thickness under four different average voltage gradients the linear relationship is satisfied between log c b f c 0 and h thus it is possible either to select the barrier thickness or the average voltage gradient in the design of electro kinetic barriers by using this chart once the soil properties and breakthrough criterion is determined if breakthrough criterion is selected as c b f c 0 10 3 the barrier thickness 1 0 m can be determined with an average voltage gradient of 2 0 v m similarly if electro kinetic barrier thickness is designed to be 1 5 m the average voltage gradient can be determined as 1 25 v m through fig 10 to give the deeper insights a dimensionless factor will be defined in the next section 5 3 effect of diffusion coefficient fig 11 presents the influence of a diffusion coefficient i e 9 45 10 10 18 9 10 10 5 0 10 9 and 9 45 10 9 m2 s 1 on the changes of base concentration over time in this analysis the value of μ λ was set as 10 m 1 the average voltage and barrier thickness was the same as the values in table 2 it should be pointed out that the ionic mobility changes proportionally with the diffusion coefficient as eq 3 as shown in fig 11 a nonlinear increase of the relative base concentration can be found with the increase of diffusion coefficient using the diffusion coefficient dpb2 9 45 10 10 m2 s 1 as the comparison the final base concentration increases by a factor of approximately 43 1 when the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 5 29 nevertheless the final base concentration increases by a factor of 58 9 as the diffusion coefficient increases 10 times in addition the time to reach a steady state decreases with an increase in diffusion coefficient therefore for the contaminant ions with high diffusion coefficients a larger average voltage gradient is necessary to improve the electro kinetic effect 5 4 effect of retardation factor the sorption capacity of the soil barrier is represented by the value of the retardation factor rd a larger rd will yield a higher sorption capacity for the compacted soil layer of the electro kinetic barrier fig 12 shows the influence of the four different retardation factors i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 on the development of the base concentration over time the figure shows that the retardation factor has little influence on the curves between the relative base concentration and dimensionless time factor t the final base concentrations of different retardation factors approach a similar value however considering the time factor t defined in eq 21 the retardation factor has an obvious influence on the real time required to reach the steady state for example when taking the time for the base concentration arriving at 0 01 of c0 as the breakthrough time the breakthrough time increases from 9 years to 26 years as retardation factor increases from 1 0 to 2 0 from this analysis the time to break through the electro kinetic barrier can be effectively prolonged by using clayey soils with a high sorption capacity 5 5 effect of electro osmotic conductivity to study the influence of electro osmosis on the transport of pb ii in the electro kinetic barrier four ratios of electro osmotic conductivity to diffusion coefficient keo dpb2 0 1 1 0 5 0 10 with dpb2 9 45 10 10 m2 s 1 were set in this analysis where the average voltage gradient was 1 0 v m and the barrier thickness was 2 m the other parameters were held the same as those in table 2 fig 13 presents the relationship between the final relative base concentration and value of keo dpb2 in the double logarithmiccoordinate system the final relative base concentration decreases with the increase of electro osmotic conductivity although the final base relative concentration decreases significantly as the value of keo dpb2 increases from 0 1 to 1 0 it still changes within the order of 10 2 which is larger than the breakthrough criterion set at 10 5 however as the value of keo dpb2 increases to 1 0 the final relative base concentration decreases significantly with the increase of electro osmotic conductivity the final relative base concentration decreases from the order of 10 2 to 10 5 as the value of keo dpb2 increases from 1 0 to 5 0 and further to 10 9 as the value of keo dpb2 reaches 10 thus we defined a concept of diffusion degree of contaminant migration u c by dividing the base concentration by its final steady value fig 14 gives the diffusion degree curves for contaminant migration with different electro osmotic conductivities time to reach the steady state can be shortened with the increase of electro osmotic conductivity nevertheless when the value of keo dpb2 is less than 1 0 the diffusion degrees of contaminant migration in the electro kinetic barrier are almost equal therefore with respect to the soil with relatively large electro osmotic conductivity the influence of electro osmosis on the transport of contaminant ions is considerable which is an important consideration in the design 5 6 normalized treatment and analysis to achieve deeper insights into the previously mentioned influence factors we introduce a dimensionless factor x as 40 χ d j k eo δ ϕ k h δ h h by using this equation the dimensionless factors corresponding to the varying average voltage gradient barrier thickness diffusion coefficient and electro osmotic conductivity in the previous analysis can be calculated then the relationship between the final relative base concentration and the dimensionless factor x can be plotted note that the larger value of diffusion coefficient will lead to a larger χ while a larger value of electro osmotic velocity and barrier thickness will lead to a decrease in χ thus the large value of χ represents rapid contaminant migration while a small value of χ represents the slow contaminant migration fig 15 presents the relationship curve between the final relative base concentration and dimensionless factor χ in the double logarithmic coordinate system as expected the base concentration at the steady state increases with the increase of dimensionless factor χ in the double logarithmic coordinate system this means that a larger quantity of contaminant will pass through the electro kinetic barrier at the steady state with respect to the larger χ in addition it can be seen that the predicted points with varying influence factors are slightly decreasing in a narrow strip with little discreteness through curve fitting an exponential growth relationship can be used to describe the relationship between the final relative base concentration and the dimensionless factor χ in the double logarithmic coordinate system the function is given as 41 l o g c b f c 0 a 1 e x p l o g χ b 1 d 1 where a1 b1 and d1 are fitting parameters thus by using this equation the value of χ can be calculated once the breakthrough criterion c b f c 0 is given in the design furthermore if the diffusion coefficient and electro osmotic conductivity of the clayey soil are given the voltage gradient and barrier thickness can be determined 6 conclusions the main conclusions obtained from the present study are as follows 1 new closed form analytical solutions for predicting transport of contaminant ions through electro kinetic barrier are presented in this paper two different bottom boundary conditions i e cauchy boundary and a fixed zero concentration boundary conditions were considered the results of the proposed analytical solution agree with experimental and numerical results 2 the average applied voltage gradient and barrier thickness have a significant influence on the contaminant ion transport within the electro kinetic barriers the final concentration and mass flux at the bottom boundary decrease with increases in the average voltage gradient and barrier thickness the logarithm of final relative base concentration changes linearly with the changes of average voltage gradient and barrier thickness 3 the diffusion coefficient of the contaminant ions and the sorption capacity of the clayey soil also have a distinct influence on the transport of contaminant ions in the electro kinetic barriers the final base concentration increases nonlinearly with the increase of ion s diffusion coefficient the soil sorption capacity has little influence on the final base concentration but the breakthrough time of the electro kinetic barrier can be effectively prolonged by using clayey soils with a high sorption capacity 4 the influence of electro osmosis is important to be considered in the design of electro kinetic barriers with an increase in the electro osmotic conductivity the final base concentration and the time required to reach the steady state decrease especially when the value of electro osmotic conductivity excesses is larger than the value of diffusion coefficient 5 a dimensionless factor χ is proposed which can be suggested as an important parameter for design which can be used to determine the soil properties average voltage gradient and barrier thickness with the given breakthrough criterion exponential growth function can be used to fit the relation curve between the final base relative concentration and χ in the double logarithmic
