continuity equation used for cfd dem coupled model in his study is the same as ours therefore the selection of continuity equation in the water air two phase flow in cfd dem modeling should be determined by the conditions last but not least the grid size in some region of our cfd dem model is definitely a little bit smaller than the aggregate size as illustrated in the comment on numerical study on pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements it will cause inaccuracy to some degree when calculating the porosity in fluid cells using unresolved cfd dem approach however the results in our cfd dem modeling are acceptable and the reasons are as follows first as introduced in the paper of sun and sakai 2015 a typical gas solid liquid flow shown in fig 1 involves fluid fluid interaction evolving fluid interface fluid solid interaction fluid particle momentum exchange and solid solid interaction particle particle collision to the best of our knowledge the core of our study is to observe the sediments clogging in the pervious concrete thus we focus only on the fluid solid interaction especially the water sediment interaction in our cfd dem model shown in fig 2 the particles aggregates with a diameter of 4 mm 8 mm and 12 mm are boned to form the pervious concrete pavement and these particles are fixed and cannot have any motions the interface between water gas is stable and above the pervious concrete pavement model as depicted in fig 3 therefore aggregate gas interaction and sediment gas interaction are neglected in our cfd dem model even though there are water flow into the pores of the pervious concrete pavement this study does not analyze these interactions including the aggregate water interaction because these factors exert little influence to sediment water interaction second as shown in fig 4 the grids in region a and b are refined to observe the interface between water and air it is evident that the grid size is small but the girds contain no particles therefore it does not violate the rule of unresolved cfd dem approach and would not influence the cfd dem simulation the grids in region c are also refined to observe the interface between water and air and they contain some aggregates and sediments the grid size is smaller than the aggregates 12 mm diameter which may cause inaccuracy to the cfd dem simulation however as mentioned above the aggregates are fixed and have no motions in this study we do not consider their influence on the cfd dem modeling most importantly the grid size in region c is still larger than the particles of sediments last the grid size appropriately10 mm in region d is just a little bit smaller than the aggregate size it will not change the motions of sediments significantly and the reasons are the same as above mentioned therefore it is credible to model the sediments transport using our cfd dem model furthermore we used single particle sedimentation simulation to validate the cfd dem method used in

particles is 2650 kg m3 the viscosity and density of the water are 1 10 3 pa s and 1000 kg m3 respectively the grid size is set as 40 mm 20 mm and 10 mm separately to observe the effect on the motion of single particle in cfd simulation the standard k ε turbulence model and piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator method are used the time step of dem simulation is 2 10 5 s and the time step of cfd simulation is 2 10 4 s fig 6 shows the results of the single particle sedimentation simulation as shown in fig 6 the grid sizes of 40 mm and 20 mm are larger than the particle size while the grid size of 10 mm is smaller than the particle size however results show the velocities of single particle in different grid size are almost the same moreover all of the parameters and configuration of single particle sedimentation simulation are the same as the cfd dem model in our study consequently it demonstrated the results using the current grid size fig 4 in our cfd dem model

6141,bed load transport along widely graded river beds typically exhibits anomalous dynamics whose efficient characterization may require parsimonious stochastic models with pre defined statistics involving the waiting time and hop distance distributions for sediment particles this study employs a continuous time random walk ctrw model to characterize bed load particle motions on a widely graded gravel bed with cluster microforms built in our lab flume experiments guide the selection of the mittag leffler m l function as the waiting time distribution function and the lévy α stable density for the hop distance distribution function in the ctrw model monte carlo simulations show that the resulting ctrw model can well capture the observed flume experimental data with either a continuous or an instantaneous source with coexisting super and sub dispersion behaviors in the bed load transport process analyses further discover the dual impact of clusters on the dynamics of fine sediment particles some particles are more likely to be blocked or trapped by clusters while others have a high probability to be accelerated by the flow accelerating belt between the clusters therefore with proper statistical distributions and relevant parameters for sediment waiting times and hop distances the ctrw model may efficiently capture the complex dynamics in sediment transport keywords bed load transport continuous time random walk heavy tailed distribution anomalous dispersion 1 introduction efficient modeling of widely graded bed load transport in nature rivers remains a challenge in river engineering this is because the transport behavior of widely graded bed load is an extremely complex process due to the multi scale heterogeneity of the river bed topography spatiotemporal variations of exchange flows between streams and sediment and complex turbulent flow in natural rivers liedermann et al 2018 roth et al 2017 a key problem is how to accurately describe the stochastic nature of transport behavior of sediment particles on widely graded armored beds with cluster microforms the main objective of bed load transport modeling is to reliably describe the bed load particle motions i e rolling sliding or saltation separated by resting periods bed load transport plays an important role in riverbed evolution reservoir sedimentation and even flood propagation diplas and shaheen 2007 chien and wan 1999 cao et al 2011 at early stages the research of transport behavior of bed load was mainly focused on population average velocity chien and wan 1999 recently investigations into the spatiotemporal distribution of bed load transport velocities have attracted more attention in model development including the fractional advection dispersion equation f ade sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the random walk simulation with different statistical distributions for travel distances ferguson and wathen 1998 fathel et al 2015 martin et al 2012 the langevin like stochastic partial differential equation for bed load particles in turbulence ancey and heyman 2014 ancey 2010 and other physical theories including both deterministic and stochastic methods dagan and neuman 2005 wu et al 2000 wilcock and crowe 2003 the above deterministic or stochastic theories can capture anomalous transport phenomena and time dependent characteristics of bed load transport from different perspectives previous models however lacks the bridge in macroscopic deterministic equations and microscopic particle motion behavior more efforts are still needed in the physical mechanism analysis and quantification of bed load transport especially the widely graded bed load transport in riverbeds with particle clusters and flow accelerating belts this challenge motivated this study the probability model based on stochastic motion of bed load poisson model was established by einstein as early as 1937 einstein 1937 einstein assumed that the distributions of hop distances and waiting times were exponential in the poisson model but ignored anomalous dispersion behavior in the bed load transport process anomalous dispersion behavior means that the distributions of hop distances and waiting times break the original thin tailed distributions assumed by fickian dispersion and exhibit heavy tailed properties which have been observed in many studies bradley et al 2010 stark et al 2009 berkowitz et al 2006 heavy tail means that the probability for large variables declines slower than the exponential thin tail function this study investigates the continuous time random walk ctrw model in characterizing non uniform bed load transport behavior which has been widely concerned in recent years ctrw is a practical tool for anomalous transport modeling especially when breakthrough curves or snapshots are obtainable from passive tracer experiments the ctrw model has been successfully applied to predict the time dependent kinetics of conservative and reactive tracers in strongly inhomogeneous media and constant velocity experiments nissan et al 2017 lévy and berkowitz 2003 cortis and berkowitz 2004 the geometric pore space of the non fickian transport model including the observed pore volume and throat between the three dimensional intermittent particle velocities has been used to define solute particle dynamics in the ctrw model bijeljic and blunt 2006 holzner et al 2015 notably in recent years the statistical investigation into waiting time and jump distance of particles in anomalous transport phenomena e g sediment or solute transport has also attracted the attention of various researchers dentz and tartakovsky 2006 fan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 which are also highly consistent with the ctrw theory the literature reviewed above takes into account the basic concept maps transmitted in heterogeneous systems gläser et al 2017 and lays the foundation for the extensive application of the ctrw theory pelosi et al 2014 the essence of anomalous transport in the ctrw framework is the heavy tailed probability density function pdf of the waiting times and hop distances which extends the exponential decay process of normal transport to the heavy tailed decay process of anomalous transport metzler and klafter 2000 fulger et al 2008 the spread distribution of hop distances and waiting times leads to non gaussian propagation in the system brockmann et al 2006 however there are still some open problems for the applicability of the ctrw theory and models in quantifying and interpreting anomalous dynamics of bed load on the widely graded gravel bed with cluster micro forms the purpose of this work is to answer three questions using the ctrw model associated with the monte carlo simulation method rubinstein 2008 first can the ctrw model characterize the nature of time dependent anomalous dispersion in bed load transport second can the ctrw model offer a better description of anomalous bed load transport with different particle sizes in anomalous transport this is one of the key problems for real world applications third can the ctrw model better interpret the physical mechanisms of widely graded bed load particles these questions are the main focuses of this study 2 physical basis and model development 2 1 pdfs of sediment hop distances and waiting times many studies have found that the pdfs of sediment hop distances and waiting times can exhibit heavy tailed distributions hop distances for bed load tracers typically exhibit a power law distribution with a divergent mean for example stark et al 2009 found that the bed load sediment hop distances in a mountain river channel follow generalized pareto distributions ganti et al 2010 found that the complexity of rivers is characterized by a broad distribution of particle size and extreme flood events which can lead to the heavy tailed distribution of hop distances the heavy tailed distribution of waiting times for bed load tracers are also well documented for example bradley et al 2010 found that the heavy tailed distribution of waiting times can result in sub dispersion for bed load tracers haschenburger and wilcock 2003 found that the waiting times for bed load sediments can be very long with a divergent mean it is noteworthy that the sediment transport behaviors and relevant pdfs for sediment dynamics are affected by many factors including the sediment gradation bed topography and elevation sediment input conditions and flow conditions in this study we assume that the waiting time distribution follows the mittag leffler m l function and the hop distance distribution follows the α stable density which allow the dispersion plume of bed load sediments to transit from normal to anomalous transport behaviors this assumption will be checked using the resultant models to capture sediment dynamics observed in our flume experiments 2 2 model derivation riverbed heterogeneity occurs on a wide range of spatial scales due to various reasons such as those mentioned above these spatial scales range from the microscopic sediment geometry and size to macroscopic cluster distribution and geological structure bridge and bennett 1992 jing et al 2009 the resultant snapshots of sediment i e the spatial distribution of sediment at a sampling cycle commonly exhibit heavy leading edges which show a slow power law decay rate rather than the fast exponential decline rate sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the non gaussian plume can be caused by turbulence burst at the small scale ancey and heyman 2014 at a larger scale non fickian behavior can also be caused by mechanisms including sediment transport through flow accelerating belts with occasional trapping in clusters and mass exchange between mobiles and immobile zones zhang et al 2016 the ctrw framework provides a convenient model to simulate bed load transport it is known that although different mechanisms can generate anomalous dispersion their main features can be obtained from the ctrw scheme as time t the basic assumption for the simplest one dimensional decoupled ctrw model is that the hop distances for sediment particles as well as the waiting time between two successive jumps are independent and identically distributed i i d random variables the process 1 t n i 1 n τ i t 0 0 n n τ i r is the renewal times so that the dispersion displacement at time t t n t n 1 is given by 2 x dis t i 1 n ξ i ξ i r where ξ i is the hop distance between two consecutive jumps and the accumulative advective displacement can be calculated by 3 x adv t v t where v represents the mean velocity of sediment particles therefore the one dimensional ctrw process with the mean advective velocity v can be expressed by the following formula 4 x n 1 x n v t n 1 t n ξ i the impact of the river system s spatial heterogeneity on sediment transport is captured by applying the random dispersion displacement and waiting time in the study the dispersion displacement consists of a series of i i d hop distances ξ i separated by i i d waiting times τ i φ ξ τ λ ξ ψ τ which can be decomposed according to the marginal pdfs of hop distances λ ξ and waiting times ψ τ the pdf of the one dimensional decoupled ctrw obeys the following equation montroll and weiss 1965 klafter et al 1987 5 p x t δ x ψ t d ξ 0 t d τ λ ξ ψ τ p x ξ t τ where ψ t is a complementary distribution survival function of waiting times in fourier laplace space eq 5 is rewritten as follows 6 p k s ψ s 1 λ k ψ s we assume the lévy α stable distribution and the m l distribution for bed load particles with all sizes the characteristic function of the lévy α stable distribution can be presented in the so called form c 0 α 2 zolotarev et al 1999 zolotarev 1986 7 λ x γ x f k 1 exp γ x k α x and the waiting times are characterized by the m l distribution 0 β 1 8 ψ t γ t d dt e β t γ t β the solution of eq 6 see appendix a 9 p x t d β t β α q xd β t β α α β where the function 10 q ξ α β f k 1 e β k α ξ is the fractional stable density the width of the anomalous dispersion sediment plume grows as δ t t β a leading to sub dispersion when β α 1 2 and super dispersion when β α 1 2 this work innovatively characterizes anomalous dispersion of bed load at macro scale by means of statistical behavior of the individual sediment particles using the ctrw model to capture the trajectory of individual particles we apply the standard monte carlo method used extensively by hydrologists see for example dentz et al 2004 meanwhile we assume that the distributions of waiting times and hop distances are uncoupled in the ctrw model a common assumption used by the ctrw framework a commonly used random jump following the lévy α stable random variable is proposed by chambers et al 1976 11 ξ α γ x ln u cos θ cos 1 α θ 1 1 α sin α θ cos θ where θ v 1 2 π u v 0 1 are independent uniform random numbers γ x is the scale parameter and α is a lévy α

t is the time scale parameter u v 0 1 are independent uniform random numbers γ x α γ t β d and β is a m l distribution parameter 2 3 model analysis according to eq 4 bed load transport is mainly controlled by stochastic term ξ i and τ i which reflect the dispersion behavior of bed load tracers fig 1 shows the dispersive jumps of bed load i e the spatial distribution of bed load described by the ctrw model calculated by eq 9 using the inverse fast fourier transform ifft fig 1a shows the impact of parameters defining the distributions of the waiting times and hop distances on the bed load snapshots the dispersion behavior transfers from normal dispersion black line to sub dispersion red line and super dispersion blue line the plume transits from gaussian black line to non gaussian distributions and the super dispersion transport leads to flatter plumes and the sub dispersion transport leads to sharp plumes the heavy tailed distributions of waiting times can enhance sub dispersion and the hop distances mainly control super dispersion of tracers showing that the motion of individual particle is generates the heavy leading edge of plumes the heavy tailed waiting time distribution occurs when sediment particles are captured by riverbed for a long time and fracture structure in riverbed may lead to the heavy tailed distribution of hop distances when particles entering it previous researchers found that bed load particles often exhibit both super and sub dispersion owing to the complexity of flow field and riverbed structure sun et al 2015 fig 1b shows the plume variation in the presence of both super dispersion and sub dispersion in this study the results show that the m l distribution for waiting times and the lévy α stable distribution for hop distances can describe the transport dynamics transferring from sub dispersion to super dispersion fig 2 a depicts the trajectories of particles with super dispersion sub dispersion and normal dispersion respectively in many systems dispersion is well described by the theory of brownian motion the standard brownian transport is characterized by a linear mean squared displacement msd described by x t vt 2 t where v is the mean velocity of all particles and denotes the ensemble average however due to the complexity of the environment the dispersion behavior of bed load particles often violate the hallmarks of standard brownian transport and show anomalous dynamics anomalous dispersion exhibits a nonlinear msd expressed by x t vt 2 t α with α 1 for super dispersion and α 1 for sub dispersion as illustrated by fig 2b the dispersion behavior of particles can be clearly distinguished by the msd in the ctrw model and the temporal evolution of msd for anomalous dispersion deviates obviously from the linear trend meanwhile in the ctrw model the survival function is an important index of determining the starting probability of sediment particles which indicates the probability for particles in situ fig 3 reveals the survival function of the ctrw model when the waiting time follows the m l distribution the m l survival function computed from eq 8 contains the early time approximation which is the stretched exponential distribution at time t 0 and the late time asymptote which is the power law distribution at time t and the smaller parameter β causes the heavier tailed survival function fig 4 plots the time evolution of p x t with an initial condition p x 0 δ x and shows the decline of the peak at the origin x 0 as t evolves 3 experiment and model fitting 3 1 experimental step at present there are many experiments focusing on uniform bed load transport while fewer studies have been carried out to study anomalous transport of widely graded particles in an armored bed with clusters diplas and shaheen 2007 little and mayer 1976 mao et al 2011 in previous studies the fractional derivative model was successfully applied to capture anomalous transport of bed load owing to the memory embedded in the definition of fractional derivative sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 with the development of measurement techniques many experiments showed that anomalous dispersion of bed load can be characterized by the distributions of waiting time and hop distance for example olinde and johnson 2015 found that the thin tailed hop distance distribution and the heavy tailed waiting time distribution can capture super dispersion of bed load tracers therefore it is meaningful to bridge between the individual particle motion and the macroscopic phenomena in this study the experimental riverbed was composed of five different particle size groups with the diameter of 0 45 1 3 7 and 17 mm respectively we carried out two experiments with different source injection modes continuous source and instantaneous source in the experiment we recorded the bed load of three particle sizes 1 3 and 7 mm respectively our previous study found that the displacement of sediment front in time exhibited anomalous dynamics for all the three size tracers and large tracers exhibited stronger sub dispersion the specific data of each experiment were shown in sun et al 2015 the average velocity for bed load can be approximated by the following formula 13 v 1 n i 1 m n i l i t where n is the total number of particles m is the number of intervals discretizing the space l i is the distance from the current location of the particle to the source n i is the number of particles around l i and t is half of the total time 3 2 bed load transport with a continuous source as mentioned above this work aims to use a ctrw model to capture anomalous dispersion of bed load and link the overall dispersion of sediment and random displacement of individual bed load particles to verify the efficiency of the ctrw model in describing anomalous dispersion of bed load results of the three flume experiments d 1 3 and 7 mm and the ctrw model are shown in figs 5 7 results illustrate that the ctrw model can capture the overall trend of snapshots observed in all the flume experiments especially the heavy leading edge of sediment snapshots the best fit parameters using the early time observations offer effective predictions for the late time i e t 355 430 or 345 min implying stationary transport within the experimental period the best fit parameters and the calculated v are listed in table 1 as listed in table 1 the best fit parameters α and β change with the sediment particle size to capture anomalous dispersion of the small bed load particles d 1 mm the largest waiting time distribution parameter β 0 9 and the smallest hop distance distribution parameter α 1 2 are needed with an increasing particle size the best fit β decreases and the best fit α increases which illustrates that the fine bed load exhibits stronger super dispersion while the coarse grained bed load exhibits stronger sub dispersion this discrepancy may be due to the clusters and the structure of flow accelerating belts formed by the bed load particles on the riverbed the cluster structures are usually observed on river beds and affect bed load transport rates apparently strom et al 2004 wittenberg and newson 2005 for example a fine particle has a high probability to be accelerated along the flow accelerating belts structure which tends to enlarge the overall hop distance meanwhile under the condition of low intensity sediment transport due to the weight influence a coarse particle is difficult to start to move and more likely to be blocked by the clusters leading to a longer waiting time than the fine particle this phenomenon may expand the distribution of the hop distance and waiting time of bed load tracers and the transport behaviors violate the assumption of fickian normal dispersion meanwhile super dispersion and sub dispersion occur simultaneously in the transport process for the particles with different sizes namely in a non uniform bed load transport process some particles are captured by the clusters while others can enter the flow accelerating belts this explains that the mean value of waiting times and the variance of hop distances diverge for all sizes of bed load particles 3 3 bed load transport with an instantaneous source further investigation is needed to determine whether the transport behavior of bed load has the characteristics of heavy tailed edges under the instantaneous source condition and whether the ctrw model can capture bed load transport under different source injection modes figs 8 10 illustrate the results of the ctrw model fitting the observed snapshots of bed load in the case of an instantaneous source the measured snapshots for the tracer particles exhibited obviously heavy tailed behavior figs 8 b 9 b and 10 b implying that the bed load transport also exhibits anomalous dispersion characteristics under the instantaneous source condition the best fit parameters and the average velocity v calculated by eq 13 are listed in table 2 results show that the transport behavior of bed load is consistent under the two conditions continuous versus instantaneous source where the fine particles exhibit stronger super dispersion behavior than the coarse particles yet some discrepancy in the results can be obtained by comparing tables 1 and 2 for example the parameter α under the instantaneous source condition is larger than that with a continuous source while the parameter β is less than or equal to that for the continuous source this discrepancy may be mainly due to the burying effect since the particles are more difficult to be distinguished after being captured by clusters under the continuous source condition in addition difference of flow velocity leads to the tracer particles average velocity with the instantaneous source being larger than that with the continuous source the best fit results also reveal that the ctrw model cannot completely capture the tracer particles heavy tail edges when the time scale is short fig 10 this phenomenon is mainly due to the scale effect since the observation time of the 7 mm sediment experimental data is only 33 min which is much smaller than the case of 1 mm 117 min and 3 mm 86 min experimental groups in addition due to the limitation of the laboratory scale the transport behavior of the 7 mm particles cannot be exhaustively observed by the experimental instruments 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between macroscopic results and stochastic motion of individual particles in previous sections we found that transport of bed load particles on the river bed composed of non uniform sediment shows obvious anomalous dispersion behaviors and the ctrw model can capture the overall trend of sediment snapshots with a heavy leading edge an exciting contrast of outcomes between experiments and the ctrw model is that the anomalous dispersion behavior of the bed load particles is related to the particle size here we investigate the mechanism of bed load anomalous dispersion related to the main parameters in the ctrw model as shown in tables 1 and 2 since the parameters of the continuous source and instantaneous source have the same changing trend we choose the parameters under the continuous source condition and analyze their influence on the individual particle trajectory in the ctrw model meanwhile we aim to evaluate the continuous and instantaneous source by comparing their msd which is the criteria for fickian non fickian transport results are depicted in figs 11 13 the left plot of each figure presents the path of 100 particles and the right plot shows the path of a single particle with the same parameters comparison shows that the corresponding parameters of bed load with different particle sizes differ significantly considering the range of the displacement and the behavior of trajectories as the main factors in the ctrw model the 1 mm bed load particles parameter α is the smallest while the parameter β is the largest for the 3 mm and 7 mm particles causing the largest dispersion displacement at the constant time and showing the super dispersion behavior the bed load particles with a smaller size exhibit shorter waiting times and larger hop distances as shown by the 1 mm particles fig 11 b contrarily the 7 mm particles produce the longest waiting time since they can be trapped for a long time fig 13 b these phenomena correspond to the heterogeneity of the river bed structure observed in the laboratory where the riverbed structures can accelerate the small particles while blocking the large particles msd is an important indicator to distinguish transport behavior compared with normal transport where the plume variance increases linearly with time bed load transport always exhibits anomalous diffusion with a nonlinear growth rate for the plume variance as detailed in fig 14 we compare the msd for the particles with three different sizes under the continuous and instantaneous source conditions the results show that transport of bed load does not follow fickian dispersion x t vt 2 t but obeys the anomalous dispersion behavior with the plume variance x t vt 2 t α α 1 where v can be calculated by eq 13 comparison of the msd also indicates that super dispersion weakens with an increasing particle size and super dispersion for bed load with the instantaneous source is weaker than that of continuous source 4 2 limitations of the ctrw model and the flume experiments there are three main shortcomings of the ctrw model used in this study first the model assumes independent waiting time and hop distance and therefore it is impossible to explore the coupled process with connected waiting time and hop distance for bed load transport second the decoupled ctrw implies instantaneous jumps while in reality particles and clusters move with finite velocities finite velocity can drastically change the governing equation and it solution e g lévy walk process and we deal with the symmetric ctrw in the reference system moving with advection asymmetry in hop distributions changes the solution of eq 5 finally the ctrw model can capture anomalous dispersion of bed load but we cannot predict the ctrw model parameters quantitatively from the macroscopic performance and the river bed properties these problems need to be explored in a future research there are two main limitations in the flume experiment first through the analysis it can be seen that the ctrw model greatly shifts the displacement under different parameters and some particles escape the flume the scale of the experiments is limited by the laboratory scale which is quite different from the actual scale of nature rivers the transport of bed load at different scales are not the same second in the flume experiment we did not consider the released particles buried by the river bed exchange of particles with the river bed is an important part in bed load transport 5 conclusion this study combines flume experiments and the ctrw based theoretical model to study anomalous dispersion in bed load transport the anomalous dispersion mechanism of bed load transport is explained by the ctrw model from the point of view of individual particle motion characterized by the pdf of particle s waiting times and hop distances four conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 applications show that the ctrw model with heavy tailed hop distances and waiting times can efficiently characterize the observed transport behavior for non uniform bed load sediment under different source load conditions i e continuous instantaneous source 2 the flume experimental data and the ctrw model indicate that anomalous dispersion of bed load is sensitive to the size of particles under the condition of low intensity sediment transport the fine particles exhibit stronger super dispersion while the coarse particles show stronger sub dispersion since they can be trapped for a relatively longer time on the sand bed 3 the particle formed cluster and the fast channel structure on the river bed may be the main factor leading to the anomalous dispersion behavior of bed load some particles are blocked trapped by clusters others can enter the flow accelerating belts which lead to the broad distribution of random waiting times and hop distances 4 the ctrw model can capture the anomalous dispersion of non uniform bed load tracers where the distributions of the waiting time and the hop distance are the two key factors to determine the anomalous dispersion dynamics

6141,bed load transport along widely graded river beds typically exhibits anomalous dynamics whose efficient characterization may require parsimonious stochastic models with pre defined statistics involving the waiting time and hop distance distributions for sediment particles this study employs a continuous time random walk ctrw model to characterize bed load particle motions on a widely graded gravel bed with cluster microforms built in our lab flume experiments guide the selection of the mittag leffler m l function as the waiting time distribution function and the lévy α stable density for the hop distance distribution function in the ctrw model monte carlo simulations show that the resulting ctrw model can well capture the observed flume experimental data with either a continuous or an instantaneous source with coexisting super and sub dispersion behaviors in the bed load transport process analyses further discover the dual impact of clusters on the dynamics of fine sediment particles some particles are more likely to be blocked or trapped by clusters while others have a high probability to be accelerated by the flow accelerating belt between the clusters therefore with proper statistical distributions and relevant parameters for sediment waiting times and hop distances the ctrw model may efficiently capture the complex dynamics in sediment transport keywords bed load transport continuous time random walk heavy tailed distribution anomalous dispersion 1 introduction efficient modeling of widely graded bed load transport in nature rivers remains a challenge in river engineering this is because the transport behavior of widely graded bed load is an extremely complex process due to the multi scale heterogeneity of the river bed topography spatiotemporal variations of exchange flows between streams and sediment and complex turbulent flow in natural rivers liedermann et al 2018 roth et al 2017 a key problem is how to accurately describe the stochastic nature of transport behavior of sediment particles on widely graded armored beds with cluster microforms the main objective of bed load transport modeling is to reliably describe the bed load particle motions i e rolling sliding or saltation separated by resting periods bed load transport plays an important role in riverbed evolution reservoir sedimentation and even flood propagation diplas and shaheen 2007 chien and wan 1999 cao et al 2011 at early stages the research of transport behavior of bed load was mainly focused on population average velocity chien and wan 1999 recently investigations into the spatiotemporal distribution of bed load transport velocities have attracted more attention in model development including the fractional advection dispersion equation f ade sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the random walk simulation with different statistical distributions for travel distances ferguson and wathen 1998 fathel et al 2015 martin et al 2012 the langevin like stochastic partial differential equation for bed load particles in turbulence ancey and heyman 2014 ancey 2010 and other physical theories including both deterministic and stochastic methods dagan and neuman 2005 wu et al 2000 wilcock and crowe 2003 the above deterministic or stochastic theories can capture anomalous transport phenomena and time dependent characteristics of bed load transport from different perspectives previous models however lacks the bridge in macroscopic deterministic equations and microscopic particle motion behavior more efforts are still needed in the physical mechanism analysis and quantification of bed load transport especially the widely graded bed load transport in riverbeds with particle clusters and flow accelerating belts this challenge motivated this study the probability model based on stochastic motion of bed load poisson model was established by einstein as early as 1937 einstein 1937 einstein assumed that the distributions of hop distances and waiting times were exponential in the poisson model but ignored anomalous dispersion behavior in the bed load transport process anomalous dispersion behavior means that the distributions of hop distances and waiting times break the original thin tailed distributions assumed by fickian dispersion and exhibit heavy tailed properties which have been observed in many studies bradley et al 2010 stark et al 2009 berkowitz et al 2006 heavy tail means that the probability for large variables declines slower than the exponential thin tail function this study investigates the continuous time random walk ctrw model in characterizing non uniform bed load transport behavior which has been widely concerned in recent years ctrw is a practical tool for anomalous transport modeling especially when breakthrough curves or snapshots are obtainable from passive tracer experiments the ctrw model has been successfully applied to predict the time dependent kinetics of conservative and reactive tracers in strongly inhomogeneous media and constant velocity experiments nissan et al 2017 lévy and berkowitz 2003 cortis and berkowitz 2004 the geometric pore space of the non fickian transport model including the observed pore volume and throat between the three dimensional intermittent particle velocities has been used to define solute particle dynamics in the ctrw model bijeljic and blunt 2006 holzner et al 2015 notably in recent years the statistical investigation into waiting time and jump distance of particles in anomalous transport phenomena e g sediment or solute transport has also attracted the attention of various researchers dentz and tartakovsky 2006 fan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 which are also highly consistent with the ctrw theory the literature reviewed above takes into account the basic concept maps transmitted in heterogeneous systems gläser et al 2017 and lays the foundation for the extensive application of the ctrw theory pelosi et al 2014 the essence of anomalous transport in the ctrw framework is the heavy tailed probability density function pdf of the waiting times and hop distances which extends the exponential decay process of normal transport to the heavy tailed decay process of anomalous transport metzler and klafter 2000 fulger et al 2008 the spread distribution of hop distances and waiting times leads to non gaussian propagation in the system brockmann et al 2006 however there are still some open problems for the applicability of the ctrw theory and models in quantifying and interpreting anomalous dynamics of bed load on the widely graded gravel bed with cluster micro forms the purpose of this work is to answer three questions using the ctrw model associated with the monte carlo simulation method rubinstein 2008 first can the ctrw model characterize the nature of time dependent anomalous dispersion in bed load transport second can the ctrw model offer a better description of anomalous bed load transport with different particle sizes in anomalous transport this is one of the key problems for real world applications third can the ctrw model better interpret the physical mechanisms of widely graded bed load particles these questions are the main focuses of this study 2 physical basis and model development 2 1 pdfs of sediment hop distances and waiting times many studies have found that the pdfs of sediment hop distances and waiting times can exhibit heavy tailed distributions hop distances for bed load tracers typically exhibit a power law distribution with a divergent mean for example stark et al 2009 found that the bed load sediment hop distances in a mountain river channel follow generalized pareto distributions ganti et al 2010 found that the complexity of rivers is characterized by a broad distribution of particle size and extreme flood events which can lead to the heavy tailed distribution of hop distances the heavy tailed distribution of waiting times for bed load tracers are also well documented for example bradley et al 2010 found that the heavy tailed distribution of waiting times can result in sub dispersion for bed load tracers haschenburger and wilcock 2003 found that the waiting times for bed load sediments can be very long with a divergent mean it is noteworthy that the sediment transport behaviors and relevant pdfs for sediment dynamics are affected by many factors including the sediment gradation bed topography and elevation sediment input conditions and flow conditions in this study we assume that the waiting time distribution follows the mittag leffler m l function and the hop distance distribution follows the α stable density which allow the dispersion plume of bed load sediments to transit from normal to anomalous transport behaviors this assumption will be checked using the resultant models to capture sediment dynamics observed in our flume experiments 2 2 model derivation riverbed heterogeneity occurs on a wide range of spatial scales due to various reasons such as those mentioned above these spatial scales range from the microscopic sediment geometry and size to macroscopic cluster distribution and geological structure bridge and bennett 1992 jing et al 2009 the resultant snapshots of sediment i e the spatial distribution of sediment at a sampling cycle commonly exhibit heavy leading edges which show a slow power law decay rate rather than the fast exponential decline rate sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the non gaussian plume can be caused by turbulence burst at the small scale ancey and heyman 2014 at a larger scale non fickian behavior can also be caused by mechanisms including sediment transport through flow accelerating belts with occasional trapping in clusters and mass exchange between mobiles and immobile zones zhang et al 2016 the ctrw framework provides a convenient model to simulate bed load transport it is known that although different mechanisms can generate anomalous dispersion their main features can be obtained from the ctrw scheme as time t the basic assumption for the simplest one dimensional decoupled ctrw model is that the hop distances for sediment particles as well as the waiting time between two successive jumps are independent and identically distributed i i d random variables the process 1 t n i 1 n τ i t 0 0 n n τ i r is the renewal times so that the dispersion displacement at time t t n t n 1 is given by 2 x dis t i 1 n ξ i ξ i r where ξ i is the hop distance between two consecutive jumps and the accumulative advective displacement can be calculated by 3 x adv t v t where v represents the mean velocity of sediment particles therefore the one dimensional ctrw process with the mean advective velocity v can be expressed by the following formula 4 x n 1 x n v t n 1 t n ξ i the impact of the river system s spatial heterogeneity on sediment transport is captured by applying the random dispersion displacement and waiting time in the study the dispersion displacement consists of a series of i i d hop distances ξ i separated by i i d waiting times τ i φ ξ τ λ ξ ψ τ which can be decomposed according to the marginal pdfs of hop distances λ ξ and waiting times ψ τ the pdf of the one dimensional decoupled ctrw obeys the following equation montroll and weiss 1965 klafter et al 1987 5 p x t δ x ψ t d ξ 0 t d τ λ ξ ψ τ p x ξ t τ where ψ t is a complementary distribution survival function of waiting times in fourier laplace space eq 5 is rewritten as follows 6 p k s ψ s 1 λ k ψ s we assume the lévy α stable distribution and the m l distribution for bed load particles with all sizes the characteristic function of the lévy α stable distribution can be presented in the so called form c 0 α 2 zolotarev et al 1999 zolotarev 1986 7 λ x γ x f k 1 exp γ x k α x and the waiting times are characterized by the m l distribution 0 β 1 8 ψ t γ t d dt e β t γ t β the solution of eq 6 see appendix a 9 p x t d β t β α q xd β t β α α β where the function 10 q ξ α β f k 1 e β k α ξ is the fractional stable density the width of the anomalous dispersion sediment plume grows as δ t t β a leading to sub dispersion when β α 1 2 and super dispersion when β α 1 2 this work innovatively characterizes anomalous dispersion of bed load at macro scale by means of statistical behavior of the individual sediment particles using the ctrw model to capture the trajectory of individual particles we apply the standard monte carlo method used extensively by hydrologists see for example dentz et al 2004 meanwhile we assume that the distributions of waiting times and hop distances are uncoupled in the ctrw model a common assumption used by the ctrw framework a commonly used random jump following the lévy α stable random variable is proposed by chambers et al 1976 11 ξ α γ x ln u cos θ cos 1 α θ 1 1 α sin α θ cos θ where θ v 1 2 π u v 0 1 are independent uniform random numbers γ x is the scale parameter and α is a lévy α

t is the time scale parameter u v 0 1 are independent uniform random numbers γ x α γ t β d and β is a m l distribution parameter 2 3 model analysis according to eq 4 bed load transport is mainly controlled by stochastic term ξ i and τ i which reflect the dispersion behavior of bed load tracers fig 1 shows the dispersive jumps of bed load i e the spatial distribution of bed load described by the ctrw model calculated by eq 9 using the inverse fast fourier transform ifft fig 1a shows the impact of parameters defining the distributions of the waiting times and hop distances on the bed load snapshots the dispersion behavior transfers from normal dispersion black line to sub dispersion red line and super dispersion blue line the plume transits from gaussian black line to non gaussian distributions and the super dispersion transport leads to flatter plumes and the sub dispersion transport leads to sharp plumes the heavy tailed distributions of waiting times can enhance sub dispersion and the hop distances mainly control super dispersion of tracers showing that the motion of individual particle is generates the heavy leading edge of plumes the heavy tailed waiting time distribution occurs when sediment particles are captured by riverbed for a long time and fracture structure in riverbed may lead to the heavy tailed distribution of hop distances when particles entering it previous researchers found that bed load particles often exhibit both super and sub dispersion owing to the complexity of flow field and riverbed structure sun et al 2015 fig 1b shows the plume variation in the presence of both super dispersion and sub dispersion in this study the results show that the m l distribution for waiting times and the lévy α stable distribution for hop distances can describe the transport dynamics transferring from sub dispersion to super dispersion fig 2 a depicts the trajectories of particles with super dispersion sub dispersion and normal dispersion respectively in many systems dispersion is well described by the theory of brownian motion the standard brownian transport is characterized by a linear mean squared displacement msd described by x t vt 2 t where v is the mean velocity of all particles and denotes the ensemble average however due to the complexity of the environment the dispersion behavior of bed load particles often violate the hallmarks of standard brownian transport and show anomalous dynamics anomalous dispersion exhibits a nonlinear msd expressed by x t vt 2 t α with α 1 for super dispersion and α 1 for sub dispersion as illustrated by fig 2b the dispersion behavior of particles can be clearly distinguished by the msd in the ctrw model and the temporal evolution of msd for anomalous dispersion deviates obviously from the linear trend meanwhile in the ctrw model the survival function is an important index of determining the starting probability of sediment particles which indicates the probability for particles in situ fig 3 reveals the survival function of the ctrw model when the waiting time follows the m l distribution the m l survival function computed from eq 8 contains the early time approximation which is the stretched exponential distribution at time t 0 and the late time asymptote which is the power law distribution at time t and the smaller parameter β causes the heavier tailed survival function fig 4 plots the time evolution of p x t with an initial condition p x 0 δ x and shows the decline of the peak at the origin x 0 as t evolves 3 experiment and model fitting 3 1 experimental step at present there are many experiments focusing on uniform bed load transport while fewer studies have been carried out to study anomalous transport of widely graded particles in an armored bed with clusters diplas and shaheen 2007 little and mayer 1976 mao et al 2011 in previous studies the fractional derivative model was successfully applied to capture anomalous transport of bed load owing to the memory embedded in the definition of fractional derivative sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 with the development of measurement techniques many experiments showed that anomalous dispersion of bed load can be characterized by the distributions of waiting time and hop distance for example olinde and johnson 2015 found that the thin tailed hop distance distribution and the heavy tailed waiting time distribution can capture super dispersion of bed load tracers therefore it is meaningful to bridge between the individual particle motion and the macroscopic phenomena in this study the experimental riverbed was composed of five different particle size groups with the diameter of 0 45 1 3 7 and 17 mm respectively we carried out two experiments with different source injection modes continuous source and instantaneous source in the experiment we recorded the bed load of three particle sizes 1 3 and 7 mm respectively our previous study found that the displacement of sediment front in time exhibited anomalous dynamics for all the three size tracers and large tracers exhibited stronger sub dispersion the specific data of each experiment were shown in sun et al 2015 the average velocity for bed load can be approximated by the following formula 13 v 1 n i 1 m n i l i t where n is the total number of particles m is the number of intervals discretizing the space l i is the distance from the current location of the particle to the source n i is the number of particles around l i and t is half of the total time 3 2 bed load transport with a continuous source as mentioned above this work aims to use a ctrw model to capture anomalous dispersion of bed load and link the overall dispersion of sediment and random displacement of individual bed load particles to verify the efficiency of the ctrw model in describing anomalous dispersion of bed load results of the three flume experiments d 1 3 and 7 mm and the ctrw model are shown in figs 5 7 results illustrate that the ctrw model can capture the overall trend of snapshots observed in all the flume experiments especially the heavy leading edge of sediment snapshots the best fit parameters using the early time observations offer effective predictions for the late time i e t 355 430 or 345 min implying stationary transport within the experimental period the best fit parameters and the calculated v are listed in table 1 as listed in table 1 the best fit parameters α and β change with the sediment particle size to capture anomalous dispersion of the small bed load particles d 1 mm the largest waiting time distribution parameter β 0 9 and the smallest hop distance distribution parameter α 1 2 are needed with an increasing particle size the best fit β decreases and the best fit α increases which illustrates that the fine bed load exhibits stronger super dispersion while the coarse grained bed load exhibits stronger sub dispersion this discrepancy may be due to the clusters and the structure of flow accelerating belts formed by the bed load particles on the riverbed the cluster structures are usually observed on river beds and affect bed load transport rates apparently strom et al 2004 wittenberg and newson 2005 for example a fine particle has a high probability to be accelerated along the flow accelerating belts structure which tends to enlarge the overall hop distance meanwhile under the condition of low intensity sediment transport due to the weight influence a coarse particle is difficult to start to move and more likely to be blocked by the clusters leading to a longer waiting time than the fine particle this phenomenon may expand the distribution of the hop distance and waiting time of bed load tracers and the transport behaviors violate the assumption of fickian normal dispersion meanwhile super dispersion and sub dispersion occur simultaneously in the transport process for the particles with different sizes namely in a non uniform bed load transport process some particles are captured by the clusters while others can enter the flow accelerating belts this explains that the mean value of waiting times and the variance of hop distances diverge for all sizes of bed load particles 3 3 bed load transport with an instantaneous source further investigation is needed to determine whether the transport behavior of bed load has the characteristics of heavy tailed edges under the instantaneous source condition and whether the ctrw model can capture bed load transport under different source injection modes figs 8 10 illustrate the results of the ctrw model fitting the observed snapshots of bed load in the case of an instantaneous source the measured snapshots for the tracer particles exhibited obviously heavy tailed behavior figs 8 b 9 b and 10 b implying that the bed load transport also exhibits anomalous dispersion characteristics under the instantaneous source condition the best fit parameters and the average velocity v calculated by eq 13 are listed in table 2 results show that the transport behavior of bed load is consistent under the two conditions continuous versus instantaneous source where the fine particles exhibit stronger super dispersion behavior than the coarse particles yet some discrepancy in the results can be obtained by comparing tables 1 and 2 for example the parameter α under the instantaneous source condition is larger than that with a continuous source while the parameter β is less than or equal to that for the continuous source this discrepancy may be mainly due to the burying effect since the particles are more difficult to be distinguished after being captured by clusters under the continuous source condition in addition difference of flow velocity leads to the tracer particles average velocity with the instantaneous source being larger than that with the continuous source the best fit results also reveal that the ctrw model cannot completely capture the tracer particles heavy tail edges when the time scale is short fig 10 this phenomenon is mainly due to the scale effect since the observation time of the 7 mm sediment experimental data is only 33 min which is much smaller than the case of 1 mm 117 min and 3 mm 86 min experimental groups in addition due to the limitation of the laboratory scale the transport behavior of the 7 mm particles cannot be exhaustively observed by the experimental instruments 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between macroscopic results and stochastic motion of individual particles in previous sections we found that transport of bed load particles on the river bed composed of non uniform sediment shows obvious anomalous dispersion behaviors and the ctrw model can capture the overall trend of sediment snapshots with a heavy leading edge an exciting contrast of outcomes between experiments and the ctrw model is that the anomalous dispersion behavior of the bed load particles is related to the particle size here we investigate the mechanism of bed load anomalous dispersion related to the main parameters in the ctrw model as shown in tables 1 and 2 since the parameters of the continuous source and instantaneous source have the same changing trend we choose the parameters under the continuous source condition and analyze their influence on the individual particle trajectory in the ctrw model meanwhile we aim to evaluate the continuous and instantaneous source by comparing their msd which is the criteria for fickian non fickian transport results are depicted in figs 11 13 the left plot of each figure presents the path of 100 particles and the right plot shows the path of a single particle with the same parameters comparison shows that the corresponding parameters of bed load with different particle sizes differ significantly considering the range of the displacement and the behavior of trajectories as the main factors in the ctrw model the 1 mm bed load particles parameter α is the smallest while the parameter β is the largest for the 3 mm and 7 mm particles causing the largest dispersion displacement at the constant time and showing the super dispersion behavior the bed load particles with a smaller size exhibit shorter waiting times and larger hop distances as shown by the 1 mm particles fig 11 b contrarily the 7 mm particles produce the longest waiting time since they can be trapped for a long time fig 13 b these phenomena correspond to the heterogeneity of the river bed structure observed in the laboratory where the riverbed structures can accelerate the small particles while blocking the large particles msd is an important indicator to distinguish transport behavior compared with normal transport where the plume variance increases linearly with time bed load transport always exhibits anomalous diffusion with a nonlinear growth rate for the plume variance as detailed in fig 14 we compare the msd for the particles with three different sizes under the continuous and instantaneous source conditions the results show that transport of bed load does not follow fickian dispersion x t vt 2 t but obeys the anomalous dispersion behavior with the plume variance x t vt 2 t α α 1 where v can be calculated by eq 13 comparison of the msd also indicates that super dispersion weakens with an increasing particle size and super dispersion for bed load with the instantaneous source is weaker than that of continuous source 4 2 limitations of the ctrw model and the flume experiments there are three main shortcomings of the ctrw model used in this study first the model assumes independent waiting time and hop distance and therefore it is impossible to explore the coupled process with connected waiting time and hop distance for bed load transport second the decoupled ctrw implies instantaneous jumps while in reality particles and clusters move with finite velocities finite velocity can drastically change the governing equation and it solution e g lévy walk process and we deal with the symmetric ctrw in the reference system moving with advection asymmetry in hop distributions changes the solution of eq 5 finally the ctrw model can capture anomalous dispersion of bed load but we cannot predict the ctrw model parameters quantitatively from the macroscopic performance and the river bed properties these problems need to be explored in a future research there are two main limitations in the flume experiment first through the analysis it can be seen that the ctrw model greatly shifts the displacement under different parameters and some particles escape the flume the scale of the experiments is limited by the laboratory scale which is quite different from the actual scale of nature rivers the transport of bed load at different scales are not the same second in the flume experiment we did not consider the released particles buried by the river bed exchange of particles with the river bed is an important part in bed load transport 5 conclusion this study combines flume experiments and the ctrw based theoretical model to study anomalous dispersion in bed load transport the anomalous dispersion mechanism of bed load transport is explained by the ctrw model from the point of view of individual particle motion characterized by the pdf of particle s waiting times and hop distances four conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 applications show that the ctrw model with heavy tailed hop distances and waiting times can efficiently characterize the observed transport behavior for non uniform bed load sediment under different source load conditions i e continuous instantaneous source 2 the flume experimental data and the ctrw model indicate that anomalous dispersion of bed load is sensitive to the size of particles under the condition of low intensity sediment transport the fine particles exhibit stronger super dispersion while the coarse particles show stronger sub dispersion since they can be trapped for a relatively longer time on the sand bed 3 the particle formed cluster and the fast channel structure on the river bed may be the main factor leading to the anomalous dispersion behavior of bed load some particles are blocked trapped by clusters others can enter the flow accelerating belts which lead to the broad distribution of random waiting times and hop distances 4 the ctrw model can capture the anomalous dispersion of non uniform bed load tracers where the distributions of the waiting time and the hop distance are the two key factors to determine the anomalous dispersion dynamics

strategic natural resource and its effective management has become a necessity and a priority for governments in rich and poor countries alike climate change has added pressure and difficulty to this complex task water resource management requires balancing supply and demand the dynamic and uncertain character of supply implies that the necessary reservoirs and sometimes interbasin transfer ibt infrastructure needs to be developed and integrated within the existing river basins this requires planning and has significant social economic and environmental impacts emanuel et al 2015 highlight the importance of the ibt of surface water resources globally and point to the dearth of information on ibt locations and characteristics both at the regional and global scales they also provide an insightful and critical assessment on the effectiveness of ibt to mitigate climate driven water shortages in this paper the spanish river basin system is studied using the paradigm of complex networks analysis cna cna is a relatively young multidisciplinary field whose object is the study of the structure and functions of networks although networks and graphs have been studied by mathematics and operations research for a long time it has not been until the last part of the past century that researchers noted the presence and importance of a number of features and phenomena that occur in the real world networks new concepts such as small world scale free networks clustering assortativity preferential attachment cascading failures etc were introduced and proved very useful to characterize and understand better the growth and behaviour of real world networks moreover the immense power of networks to capture and model relationships between physical objects or between logical entities has led to an explosion in the number of applications of these techniques including social networks transportation networks power grids logistics networks trade networks tourism flows networks citations networks business collaboration networks etc newman 2003 and da fontoura costa et al 2011 provide useful introductory papers on the theory and applications respectively of these techniques cna has also been applied to hydrology for different purposes in fact sivakumar 2015 argues that the ability of the cna paradigm to model any type of connection represents a generic theory for studying the connections and evolution of hydrologic systems sivakumar et al 2018 present an overview of applications of cna in hydrology thus for example cna has been applied to water distribution networks wdn some of these studies consider undirected unweighted networks while others consider weighted directed networks the latter requires knowing the network flows directions and hence the hydraulics of the system for example through epanet soldi et al 2015 two main research topics studied in these cna wdn papers are the structural properties and vulnerability e g yazdani and jeffrey 2011 2012 yazdani et al 2011 shuang et al 2014 2015 and the segmentation of wdn for creating district metered areas dma controlling leakage or for minimizing contamination risks e g scibetta et al 2013 diao et al 2013 2014 giustolisi and ridolfi 2014a 2014b giustolisi et al 2015 ciaponi et al 2016 cna has also been used to study streamflow and river runoff time series e g tang et al 2010 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 han et al 2018 lange et al 2018 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 these studies basically aim at streamflow modelling classification of catchments and predictions in ungauged basins a third group of cna applications to hydrology involves rainfall gauging stations scarsoglio et al 2013 jha et al 2015 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 jha and sivakumar 2017 agarwal et al 2018 naufan et al 2018 satellite based rainfall data malik et al 2012 boers et al 2013 2014 marwan and kurths 2015 ozturk et al 2018 sun et al 2018 or drought severity time series konapala and mishra 2017 these applications study the climate dynamics and spatio temporal rainfall modeling finally and this is the type of applications most closely related to the one presented in this paper cna has also been used to study water resource networks involving both natural and built components in this type of studies the nodes of the networks are the stream flows the reservoirs and the water infrastructure elements including aqueducts canals and water supply pipelines e g porse and lund 2015 2016 the main purpose of these studies is to visualize and to study the resilience of the corresponding network this paper uses the cna methodology to model a national river basin system and its associated ibt infrastructure to the best of our knowledge a similar study has not been carried out in the literature the purpose of this research is to gain insight into the structure and properties of the national hydrological system in particular we are interested in the interconnectivity between the different river basins and the extent to which the current ibt can mitigate the rainfall imbalances of the country particularly in a scenario of climate change the structure of the paper is the following section 2 describes the spanish river basin system section 3 describes the methods used in this research while section 4 presents and discusses the results of the study finally section 5 summarizes and concludes 2 description of the spanish river basin system spain has 15 river basins some of which discharge into the atlantic ocean and others into the mediterranean sea as shown in fig 1 four of them namely miño sil duero tajo and guadiana extend to portugal except for the existing engineered inter basin transfer infrastructure in principle these river basins can be considered as autonomous systems managed by the corresponding public body called confederación hidrográfica the hydrological imbalance between different parts of the country with some areas mainly in the northern part of the country showing excess rainfall and the rest central south and eastern parts suffering rainfall deficits chronic in some cases has made it necessary to build an ibt infrastructure managed by central government which in case of need can decree the transfer of specific amounts of water from one river basin to another the purpose of these water transfers which are often met with social and political opposition from the source region is to alleviate water shortages in the receiving basin table 1 show some characteristics and time series for the period 2008 2014 of the different river basins such as the size of the corresponding catchment area total water demand including irrigation industrial and municipal water supply catchment inflows reservoir capacity and levels inter basin transfer flows and ocean discharges note that there is a large disparity between the river basins in terms of their size as well as in the catchment and transfer inflows they receive table 2 shows the existing ibt infrastructures indicating the connected drainage basins connected the link length the link capacity and the average annual flows during the period 2008 2014 note that one of these pipelines is bidirectional i e the water can flow from either of the two ends to the other and another is disused also in some cases there is more than one pipeline between a given pair of river basins fig 2 shows the total demand faced by each river basin and its three components irrigation industrial use and municipal water supply for the period 2008 2104 the needs of the river basins with largest demands are basically for irrigation the river basins with smaller demands are basically for municipal water supply 3 methods in this section the cna metrics and algorithms used in this study are introduced and explained the metrics are of two types global i e for the whole network and local i e node level the basic global network measures are its order i e the number of nodes n its size i e its number of arcs m and its density i e the fraction of possible arcs that actually exist ρ for a weighted directed network like the one considered in this paper its density is given by ρ m n n 1 other global measures of interest are reciprocity igraph reciprocity function of igraph package this is the probability that the opposite counterpart of an existing directed edge also exists i e r 1 m i j a ij a ji 1 m t r a 2 where a a ij is the binary adjacency matrix whose elements indicate whether each arc i j exists or not as its name indicates this measure reflects the degree of bidirectionality of the connections in an undirected network all the connections are bidirectional and the reciprocity is one if none of the connections is bidirectional then the reciprocity is zero transitivity igraph transitivity undirected function of igraph package similar to the clustering coefficient the transitivity measures the probability that two neighbors of a vertex are connected but it is computed at the global level as the ratio of the triangles and the connected triples in the graph this measure considers the network as undirected the corresponding formula is t 3 h j i a ij a ih a jh h j i a ij a ih a ji a jh a hi a hj 1 2 t r a c e a 3 j i a 2 ij centralization index igraph centralization degree function of igraph package this is a measure of the extent to which the network topology resembles that of a star the star is used as reference because its hub spoke topology in which the central node is connected with all other nodes and these are only connected with the central node in a star the central node has n 1 connections and the n 1 nodes have just 1 connection for an undirected network the centralization index is measured as ci i k max k i n 1 n 2 where k i refers to the degree of each node i i e the number of connections it has and k max max i k i is the largest degree in the network for a directed network the centralization index can be computed using the in degree or the out degree of the nodes k i in j a ji and k i out j a ij respectively average path length igraph average path length function of igraph package this is the average geodesic distance between any pair of nodes the geodesic distance between two nodes igraph shortest paths function of igraph package d ij is the length of the shortest directed path from node i to node j therefore the average path length is d 1 n n 1 i j i d ij note that if two nodes are not connected then by convention their geodesic distance is infinite in that case the average path length can be computed taking into account only between the pair of nodes that are effectively connected note also that in the case of a weighted network the geodesic distance generally uses the lengths of the arcs given by the arc weights w ij the lower the average path length the easiest and the least costly is going or moving goods or transferring information between any pair of nodes in the network diameter igraph diameter and igraph diameter dijkstra functions of igraph package this is the largest geodesic distance between connected nodes d max i j d ij d ij it corresponds to the worst case i e geodesic distance between the nodes that are farthest apart network efficiency this is an alternative to the average path length that does not have any problem when some pairs of nodes are not connected and hence their geodesic distance is infinite instead of using the arithmetic average the network efficiency is computed as the harmonic mean of the geodesic distances i e η 1 n n 1 i j i d ij 1 the higher the geodesic distances between the nodes the lower the efficiency of the movements or the flow of goods or of the communications over the network assortativity coefficient igraph assortativity function of igraph package the assortativity of the network with respect to a certain node attribute is the pearson correlation coefficient between the value of that attribute for the two nodes linked by each arc thus if each node i has an attribute x i then r x 1 m i j a ij 1 x i x j 1 m i j a ij 1 x i 1 m i j a ij 1 x j 1 m i j a ij 1 x i 2 1 m i j a ij 1 x i 2 1 m i j a ij 1 x j 2 1 m i j a ij 1 x j 2 this assortativity coefficient measures whether nodes with a large value of the attribute are connected with nodes that also has a large value of that attribute and nodes with a low value are connected with nodes with low value if that is the case the assortativity coefficient i e the correlation is positive and there is assortativity conversely if nodes with a large value of the attribute are connected with nodes with a low value of the attribute then the correlation is negative and there is disassortativity degree degree correlation igraph avg nearest neighbor degree and igraph assortativity degree functions of igraph package when the attribute considered in the assortativity coefficient above is the node degree then we can measure the degree degree correlation between the nodes when the network is directed then the attribute considered in each end of the links can be the in or the out degree of the corresponding node the usual way of measuring this type of directed degree degree correlations is through the distribution of the corresponding average nearest neighbor degree thus for example if at the origin node of a link we consider its out degree and at the destination node of the link we consider its in degree we would be testing whether nodes with large out degree are connected with nodes with large in degree assortativity or with nodes with low in degree disassortativity to that end for each node i we compute the average out degree of the nodes that are connected to i i e k nn i out i n 1 k i in j a ji k j out and we average these values for all the nodes with the same value of the in degree i e k nn out i n k in 1 i k i in k in i k i in k in k nn i out i n plotting k nn out i n k in as a function of k in allows detecting the existence of assortativity or disassortativity between those two degree variables depending on whether the function is increasing or decreasing if the degree variables whose correlation we want to compute are the out degree of the origin node and the out degree of the destination node then the procedure is similar and the corresponding mathematical formulae would be k nn i out o u t 1 k i out j a ij k j out and k nn out o u t k out 1 i k i out k out i k i out k out k nn i out o u t as regards the node level cna measures apart from the in and out degree already mentioned the following indexes can be computed strength igraph strength function of igraph package this is the sum of the weights of the arcs that leave a node out strength s i out j w ij or of the arcs that enter the node in strength s i in j w ji node out efficiency this is the harmonic mean of the geodesic distance from a given node to every other node in the network i e η i out 1 n 1 j i d ij 1 it measures how easy it is to reach any node from that node the average of the node out efficiencies is equal to the network efficiency i e η 1 n i η i out node in efficiency this is the harmonic mean of the geodesic distance to a given node from every other node in the network i e η i in 1 n 1 j i d ji 1 it measures how easy it is to reach that node from any node the average of the node in efficiencies is also equal to the network efficiency i e η 1 n i η i in betweenness centrality igraph betweenness function of igraph package the normalized betweenness centrality of a node i corresponds to the fraction of shortest paths between each pair of nodes of the network that pass through node i averaged for all such pairs of nodes that are distinct from i the unnormalized measures is the sum of the number of shortest path between any pair of nodes that pass through node i i e β i unnormalized j p j i p σ j p i where σ j p i is the number of shortest paths from j to p that pass through i although as indicated above the in and out degree and the in and out strength are local measures their distribution is a global feature thus for example some complex networks have a scale free topology with a power law degree distribution in which most nodes have a very small degree and a few nodes called hubs has a very large degree in other cases like in random networks the degree distribution is more homogeneous with most node having a degree around the average degree when not all the nodes in a network are connected them the network can be partitioned into separate components igraph clusters function of igraph package a component is a connected subgraph i e a subset of nodes so that from each of them one can go to any other of maximal cardinality i e if a node that belongs to the component has a link with some other node that other node also belongs to the component in directed networks one can distinguish between strongly connected components and weakly connected components the former take into account the direction of the arcs while the latter correspond to the associated undirected network formed ignoring the direction of the arcs finally most real word networks have a community structure and that is also a global feature of the network a community also labeled a module corresponds to a cluster of nodes that have more connections among themselves what with nodes outside the community there are many methods for community detection in complex networks see fortunato 2010 for a survey some of those methods like clauset et al 2004 igraph community fastgreedy function of igraph package or blondel et al 2008 igraph community multilevel function of igraph package are based on the optimization of modularity newman 2006 the modularity function igraph modularity function of igraph package is a measure that indicates to what extent a given partition of the nodes represents the actual community structure of the network normally to identify the community structure an undirected network is considered let a c the number of edges within each community c and b c the sum of the degree of all the nodes in community c then the modularity is computed as q c a c m b c 2 m 2 the first term within the brackets is the fraction of edges that actually fall within each community while the second represents the expected number that should fall in that community according to the corresponding null model i e a network with the same number of nodes and edges and the same degree distribution the modularity of the partition that has all nodes as a single community is zero while the modularity of a partition in which each node constitutes a community is negative the larger the value of the modularity of a partition the better that partition matches the actual community structure of the network since the modularity cannot exceed one a partition with a modularity value above 0 3 is generally considered a good fit 4 results the spanish river basin network has 15 nodes and 14 arcs it is a weighted directed network where the weights considered depend on the purpose of the analysis thus it can be either the physical length the capacity of the transfer link or the transfer flow in a specific year or over the whole period table 3 shows some global network characterization measures note that there is no transitivity i e there are no triangles in the network which is reasonable as this would involve expensive and unnecessary connections between already connected nodes there is a small reciprocity due to the existence of some bidirectional links bidirectional links allow either of the two river basins connected to transfer water to the other almost all links are however unidirectional and hence the source and destination of the transfers are fixed the network is sparse i e the number of links is relatively small recall that each link involves a significant investment and hence their number is limited the in degree centralization index is very low but the out degree centralization index is not so recall that the centralization index measures the extent to which the network resembles a star with a central well connected node surrounded by many nodes that are not directly connected among themselves therefore the spanish river basin network shows some similarity with an out star the diameter of the network is rather large 498 1 km this is the largest geodesic distance between any pair of connected nodes the diameter corresponds to the length of the longest transfer that may be carried out in the network the average path length i e the average of the geodesic distances between connected nodes is 167 3 km measured in terms of number of links i e considering the unweighted network the diameter is 4 and the average path length is 1 67 this means that the longest possible transfer would involve four consecutive ibt links table 4 shows the geodesic distances between each pair of nodes the entries correspond to the unconnected pairs of nodes are left blank the bold entry is the network diameter which corresponds to the length of the shortest path between the taj and gdq nodes that shortest path is shown in red in fig 3 it can be seen both in fig 3 and in table 4 that most pairs of nodes are unconnected actually the network has four weakly connected components one of them namely due is a singleton the other three components are taj gdn top gdq cma gbb juc seg i e the river basins in the centre and south of spain ebr cic coc cor i e the river basins in the north and northeast of spain and glc mñs in the northwest of the country fig 4 shows the community structure identified using the fast greedy hierarchical agglomerative algorithm proposed in clauset et al 2004 the right panel of the figure shows the dendrogram that summarizes the agglomerative process in which the nodes are progressively merged into larger clusters by greedily maximizing the modularity improvement in each step the level of the dendrogram that gives the maximum value of modularity q 0 53 corresponds to the seven clusters shown on the left panel note that two of the river basins namely due and cic belong to independent single node clusters due has no connections with any other river basin cic which lies on the northeast of spain receives transfers just from ebr which is grouped in a different cluster together with cor and coc both on the north of spain there is another three node cluster that groups three river basins to the south namely gdq cma and gbb the other river basin on the southwest of pain top is clustered with the river basin that feeds it gdn the two eastern reiver basins juc and seg which are the ones with largest rainfall deficits in the country are grouped with the river basin that supplies to them taj it is interesting to note that there is a single arc connecting each of these three communities indicating that the ibt infrastructure aims at maintaining connectivity at minimum cost finally the two northwest river basins glc and mñs form a separate self sufficient subsystem recall that the northwest is the spanish region with the highest precipitation level fig 5 shows the distribution of the in and out degree it can be seen that due to the high cost of the links most nodes have a low in degree the out degree is however relatively high for some donor river basins namely taj and ebr part of whose hydrological surplus can be transferred to other regions therefore the in degree distribution shows that the river basins receive transfer from one or at most two other basins while the out degree distribution shows that some river basins with surplus water can transfer it to four other river basins the out degree of ebr is five but some of its outgoing links go to the same river basins cic and cor very informative also is the strength distribution thus fig 6 shows for the period 2008 2104 the in and out strength of the different river basins in decreasing order this allows the easy identification of those river basins that receive the largest amounts of water transfers and those that are the largest donors note that although ebr has a larger out degree it is taj that has the largest out strength these two river basins and to a lesser extent gdn and cma constitute the main ibt sources as regards in strength the main receivers of ibt flows are seg in eastern part of spain followed by cor in the north and top in the southwest these correspond with the river basins with the largest deficit between catchment inflows and local demand and that is why they require the largest ibt inflows note also that some river basins with non zero in degree namely ebr mñs coc and gdq have zero in strength this means that that the corresponding ibt infrastructure was not used at all during the period 2008 2014 as regards degree degree correlations fig 7 shows the average out degree of linking neighbours versus the in degree of a node and the average out degree of linked neighbours versus the out degree of a node the positive slope in the first case left panel is indicative of assortativity and means that nodes with larger in degrees receive connections from nodes with higher out degrees i e the river basins with more incoming ibt links feed from the river basins with more outgoing ibt links in the second case right panel the slope is negative and this disassortativity means that the river basins with more outgoing ibt links feed river basins with low outgoing ibt links all this suggests that the system has a two tier structure with some river basins functioning as ibt sources that supply multiple basins and other river basins functioning as ibt receivers that get ibt flows from more than one source in this regard note that although having an in degree larger than one adds flexibility to the ibt system it is costly and hence it is justified only when the availability of water for ibt from a single river basin is not guaranteed and hence it is necessary to diversify the ibt sources we can also look at the correlation between linked nodes in terms of some relevant node attributes such as for example catchment inflows ibt inflows reservoir capacity volume stored in reservoir and total water demand in complex network analysis this is called assortative mixing as shown in table 1 the reservoir capacity has not changed during the period under study and that the annual demand for each river basin is known on average therefore for these two node attributes a single correlation coefficient for the whole period is computed for the other river basin attributes the correlation can be computed also for each year as shown in table 5 most of the assortativity coefficients are negative indicating a disassortative mixing this means that nodes with large demand are often connected with nodes of low demand nodes of large reservoir capacity are often connected with nodes of low reservoir capacity nodes with large volume of water stored in reservoirs are connected with nodes with low volume of water stored and nodes with large ibt inflows are connected with nodes with low ibt inflows all this indicates that the ibt infrastructure has been designed to supply water from the river basins with surplus reservoir capacity to river basins with water deficits in the case of catchment inflows there are both negative and positive assortativity coefficients depending on the year most years all but 2009 and 2010 there was a positive correlation between the catchment inflows of the connected river basins both facing rainfall shortfall or surplus while in 2009 and 2010 the correlation between the catchment inflows of each pair of connected river basins was negative with one of the ends of the connection experiencing more rainfall than the other in this regard note that because of the short term character of the public perception of the water scarcity problem the social and political resistance to ibt normally arises when the donor river basin experiences low rainfall and occurs even if the receiving river basin experiences an even more acute water shortage another interesting cna characterization measure is the network efficiency in the case of the river basin network under study and using the actual lengths in km of the different links it results a rather low network efficiency 0 0026 this is not surprising given to the high cost of building this type of links which precludes the existence of many connections and shortcuts between the nodes fig 8 shows the in and out efficiency of the different nodes in decreasing order and their average i e the network efficiency the river basins with the highest in and out efficiency coincide and their out efficiency is slightly larger than their in efficiency i e their outgoing links are generally shorter than their incoming links there are some exceptions to this rule however thus for gdn cic mñs and due their out efficiency is slightly larger than their in efficiency fig 9 shows the unnormalized betweenness centrality of each node versus its in and out degrees left and right panels respectively the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality namely gdq top and cma are located in the southern part of the country and have an in degree equal to one or two and an out degree equal to one these river basins often lie on the shortest path between two other river basins this means that the water transferred between those two river basins should go through the river basin with the high betweenness centrality this implies that the corresponding ibt infrastructure is doubly utilized by the ibt flows whose destination is the river basin with high betweenness centrality and by the ibt flows that pass through that river basin with a different destination finally fig 10 shows a visualization of the network where the nodes have been placed in the centroid of each river basin the size of each node is proportional to the average catchment inflows during the period under study 2008 2014 thus larger nodes correspond to river basins with large catchment inflows the node colour shows the average percentage of utilization of the corresponding reservoir capacity as regards the arcs their size is proportional to the average flow transferred while their colour shows the percentage of utilization of the corresponding ibt infrastructure it can be seen that the largest ibt flows correspond to the taj seg ebr cor ebr cic gdn top and cma gbb links of these the ebr cor and gdn top are those that make a higher utilization of their ibt capacity the two river basins which supply the largest ibt flows are taj and ebr with the latter having a higher reservoir capacity utilization actually the fact that taj supplies large amounts of ibt flows to many neighbouring river basins in spite of its relatively low level of reservoir utilization generates concerns in the population of that region it is remarkable that due which has the largest catchments inflows of all spanish river basins is an isolated node unconnected with the rest of the system this is due to the orography of this mountainous region which makes it technically and economically unfeasible too build any ibt infrastructure note also that the north of spain has more catchments inflows than the south and the east of the country which are the driest regions most of these river basins have low levels of reservoir capacity utilization it can also be seen in fig 10 why as indicated in fig 9 top gdq and cma have high betweenness centrality followed by gdn and ebr the two tier structure of the system with ebr and taj each acting as centre of an out star with peripheral nodes that in some cases have more than one incoming link is also perceptible the different connected components are clearly visible and also with the help of fig 4 the different communities that form the two largest components 5 conclusions in this paper cna tools and concepts have been used to study and visualize the structure and interrelationships of the spanish river basins and the existing ibt infrastructure this is a novel approach that provides a holistic perspective of the system and at the same time allows assessing the role and centrality of the different nodes of the network thus a number of network characterization measures can be computed such as the density reciprocity centralization index average path length and diameter efficiency etc the picture these measures draw is of a sparse network with low reciprocity zero transitivity four components one of them formed by just a single unconnected node relatively large average path length and diameter and low efficiency most of these features can be explained by the high cost of establishing links between the nodes the out degree distribution is broader maximum out degree 5 than the in degree distribution maximum in degree 2 i e there are a few river basins namely ebr and taj that each supply ibt flows to a relatively large number of receiver river basins while those receiver river basins have incoming links from at most two of these source river basins the cna results also indicate that the ibt infrastructure has been designed to supply water from the river basins with surplus reservoir capacity to river basins with water deficits and that the system has a two tier structure with some river basins functioning as ibt sources that supply multiple basins and other river basins functioning as ibt receivers that get ibt flows from more than one source this diversification of ibt sourcing implies that the availability of water for ibt from a single river basin is not guaranteed a neat community structure involving seven small clusters of two or three nodes generally has also been identified it is interesting to note that in most cases there is a single arc connecting these communities indicating that the ibt infrastructure aims at maintaining connectivity at minimum cost the in and out strength distributions clearly identify the main source and recipient river basins of the ibt flows they also show that some river basins with incoming ibt links have not made any use of them during the period under study the in and out efficiency of each node and its contribution to the overall network efficiency have also been determined and the nodes with high betweenness centrality have been identified in summary this study has carried out a thorough and insightful analysis of the spanish river basin system and their ibt interconnections it can be concluded that the topology and characteristics of the network are a consequence of the imbalances created by the varying climatic conditions of the river basins the water storage capacity provided by the existing reservoir infrastructure the geographical and orographic constraints of the country and the high cost of establishing links between neighbouring river basins as a continuation of this research a more fine grained study considering the different sub drainage basins that form each drainage basin is planned also a similar study on a larger scale e g the european river basins would be desirable in this regard it is anticipated that the largest difficulty that would be faced is that of data collection credit

infrastructure needs to be developed and integrated within the existing river basins this requires planning and has significant social economic and environmental impacts emanuel et al 2015 highlight the importance of the ibt of surface water resources globally and point to the dearth of information on ibt locations and characteristics both at the regional and global scales they also provide an insightful and critical assessment on the effectiveness of ibt to mitigate climate driven water shortages in this paper the spanish river basin system is studied using the paradigm of complex networks analysis cna cna is a relatively young multidisciplinary field whose object is the study of the structure and functions of networks although networks and graphs have been studied by mathematics and operations research for a long time it has not been until the last part of the past century that researchers noted the presence and importance of a number of features and phenomena that occur in the real world networks new concepts such as small world scale free networks clustering assortativity preferential attachment cascading failures etc were introduced and proved very useful to characterize and understand better the growth and behaviour of real world networks moreover the immense power of networks to capture and model relationships between physical objects or between logical entities has led to an explosion in the number of applications of these techniques including social networks transportation networks power grids logistics networks trade networks tourism flows networks citations networks business collaboration networks etc newman 2003 and da fontoura costa et al 2011 provide useful introductory papers on the theory and applications respectively of these techniques cna has also been applied to hydrology for different purposes in fact sivakumar 2015 argues that the ability of the cna paradigm to model any type of connection represents a generic theory for studying the connections and evolution of hydrologic systems sivakumar et al 2018 present an overview of applications of cna in hydrology thus for example cna has been applied to water distribution networks wdn some of these studies consider undirected unweighted networks while others consider weighted directed networks the latter requires knowing the network flows directions and hence the hydraulics of the system for example through epanet soldi et al 2015 two main research topics studied in these cna wdn papers are the structural properties and vulnerability e g yazdani and jeffrey 2011 2012 yazdani et al 2011 shuang et al 2014 2015 and the segmentation of wdn for creating district metered areas dma controlling leakage or for minimizing contamination risks e g scibetta et al 2013 diao et al 2013 2014 giustolisi and ridolfi 2014a 2014b giustolisi et al 2015 ciaponi et al 2016 cna has also been used to study streamflow and river runoff time series e g tang et al 2010 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 han et al 2018 lange et al 2018 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 these studies basically aim at streamflow modelling classification of catchments and predictions in ungauged basins a third group of cna applications to hydrology involves rainfall gauging stations scarsoglio et al 2013 jha et al 2015 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 jha and sivakumar 2017 agarwal et al 2018 naufan et al 2018 satellite based rainfall data malik et al 2012 boers et al 2013 2014 marwan and kurths 2015 ozturk et al 2018 sun et al 2018 or drought severity time series konapala and mishra 2017 these applications study the climate dynamics and spatio temporal rainfall modeling finally and this is the type of applications most closely related to the one presented in this paper cna has also been used to study water resource networks involving both natural and built components in this type of studies the nodes of the networks are the stream flows the reservoirs and the water infrastructure elements including aqueducts canals and water supply pipelines e g porse and lund 2015 2016 the main purpose of these studies is to visualize and to study the resilience of the corresponding network this paper uses the cna methodology to model a national river basin system and its associated ibt infrastructure to the best of our knowledge a similar study has not been carried out in the literature the purpose of this research is to gain insight into the structure and properties of the national hydrological system in particular we are interested in the interconnectivity between the different river basins and the extent to which the current ibt can mitigate the rainfall imbalances of the country particularly in a scenario of climate change the structure of the paper is the following section 2 describes the spanish river basin system section 3 describes the methods used in this research while section 4 presents and discusses the results of the study finally section 5 summarizes and concludes 2 description of the spanish river basin system spain has 15 river basins some of which discharge into the atlantic ocean and others into the mediterranean sea as shown in fig 1 four of them namely miño sil duero tajo and guadiana extend to portugal except for the existing engineered inter basin transfer infrastructure in principle these river basins can be considered as autonomous systems managed by the corresponding public body called confederación hidrográfica the hydrological imbalance between different parts of the country with some areas mainly in the northern part of the country showing excess rainfall and the rest central south and eastern parts suffering rainfall deficits chronic in some cases has made it necessary to build an ibt infrastructure managed by central government which in case of need can decree the transfer of specific amounts of water from one river basin to another the purpose of these water transfers which are often met with social and political opposition from the source region is to alleviate water shortages in the receiving basin table 1 show some characteristics and time series for the period 2008 2014 of the different river basins such as the size of the corresponding catchment area total water demand including irrigation industrial and municipal water supply catchment inflows reservoir capacity and levels inter basin transfer flows and ocean discharges note that there is a large disparity between the river basins in terms of their size as well as in the catchment and transfer inflows they receive table 2 shows the existing ibt infrastructures indicating the connected drainage basins connected the link length the link capacity and the average annual flows during the period 2008 2014 note that one of these pipelines is bidirectional i e the water can flow from either of the two ends to the other and another is disused also in some cases there is more than one pipeline between a given pair of river basins fig 2 shows the total demand faced by each river basin and its three components irrigation industrial use and municipal water supply for the period 2008 2104 the needs of the river basins with largest demands are basically for irrigation the river basins with smaller demands are basically for municipal water supply 3 methods in this section the cna metrics and algorithms used in this study are introduced and explained the metrics are of two types global i e for the whole network and local i e node level the basic global network measures are its order i e the number of nodes n its size i e its number of arcs m and its density i e the fraction of possible arcs that actually exist ρ for a weighted directed network like the one considered in this paper its density is given by ρ m n n 1 other global measures of interest are reciprocity igraph reciprocity function of igraph package this is the probability that the opposite counterpart of an existing directed edge also exists i e r 1 m i j a ij a ji 1 m t r a 2 where a a ij is the binary adjacency matrix whose elements indicate whether each arc i j exists or not as its name indicates this measure reflects the degree of bidirectionality of the connections in an undirected network all the connections are bidirectional and the reciprocity is one if none of the connections is bidirectional then the reciprocity is zero transitivity igraph transitivity undirected function of igraph package similar to the clustering coefficient the transitivity measures the probability that two neighbors of a vertex are connected but it is computed at the global level as the ratio of the triangles and the connected triples in the graph this measure considers the network as undirected the corresponding formula is t 3 h j i a ij a ih a jh h j i a ij a ih a ji a jh a hi a hj 1 2 t r a c e a 3 j i a 2 ij centralization index igraph centralization degree function of igraph package this is a measure of the extent to which the network topology resembles that of a star the star is used as reference because its hub spoke topology in which the central node is connected with all other nodes and these are only connected with the central node in a star the central node has n 1 connections and the n 1 nodes have just 1 connection for an undirected network the centralization index is measured as ci i k max k i n 1 n 2 where k i refers to the degree of each node i i e the number of connections it has and k max max i k i is the largest degree in the network for a directed network the centralization index can be computed using the in degree or the out degree of the nodes k i in j a ji and k i out j a ij respectively average path length igraph average path length function of igraph package this is the average geodesic distance between any pair of nodes the geodesic distance between two nodes igraph shortest paths function of igraph package d ij is the length of the shortest directed path from node i to node j therefore the average path length is d 1 n n 1 i j i d ij note that if two nodes are not connected then by convention their geodesic distance is infinite in that case the average path length can be computed taking into account only between the pair of nodes that are effectively connected note also that in the case of a weighted network the geodesic distance generally uses the lengths of the arcs given by the arc weights w ij the lower the average path length the easiest and the least costly is going or moving goods or transferring information between any pair of nodes in the network diameter igraph diameter and igraph diameter dijkstra functions of igraph package this is the largest geodesic distance between connected nodes d max i j d ij d ij it corresponds to the worst case i e geodesic distance between the nodes that are farthest apart network efficiency this is an alternative to the average path length that does not have any problem when some pairs of nodes are not connected and hence their geodesic distance is infinite instead of using the arithmetic average the network efficiency is computed as the harmonic mean of the geodesic distances i e η 1 n n 1 i j i d ij 1 the higher the geodesic distances between the nodes the lower the efficiency of the movements or the flow of goods or of the communications over the network assortativity coefficient igraph assortativity function of igraph package the assortativity of the network with respect to a certain node attribute is the pearson correlation coefficient between the value of that attribute for the two nodes linked by each arc thus if each node i has an attribute x i then r x 1 m i j a ij 1 x i x j 1 m i j a ij 1 x i 1 m i j a ij 1 x j 1 m i j a ij 1 x i 2 1 m i j a ij 1 x i 2 1 m i j a ij 1 x j 2 1 m i j a ij 1 x j 2 this assortativity coefficient measures whether nodes with a large value of the attribute are connected with nodes that also has a large value of that attribute and nodes with a low value are connected with nodes with low value if that is the case the assortativity coefficient i e the correlation is positive and there is assortativity conversely if nodes with a large value of the attribute are connected with nodes with a low value of the attribute then the correlation is negative and there is disassortativity degree degree correlation igraph avg nearest neighbor degree and igraph assortativity degree functions of igraph package when the attribute considered in the assortativity coefficient above is the node degree then we can measure the degree degree correlation between the nodes when the network is directed then the attribute considered in each end of the links can be the in or the out degree of the corresponding node the usual way of measuring this type of directed degree degree correlations is through the distribution of the corresponding average nearest neighbor degree thus for example if at the origin node of a link we consider its out degree and at the destination node of the link we consider its in degree we would be testing whether nodes with large out degree are connected with nodes with large in degree assortativity or with nodes with low in degree disassortativity to that end for each node i we compute the average out degree of the nodes that are connected to i i e k nn i out i n 1 k i in j a ji k j out and we average these values for all the nodes with the same value of the in degree i e k nn out i n k in 1 i k i in k in i k i in k in k nn i out i n plotting k nn out i n k in as a function of k in allows detecting the existence of assortativity or disassortativity between those two degree variables depending on whether the function is increasing or decreasing if the degree variables whose correlation we want to compute are the out degree of the origin node and the out degree of the destination node then the procedure is similar and the corresponding mathematical formulae would be k nn i out o u t 1 k i out j a ij k j out and k nn out o u t k out 1 i k i out k out i k i out k out k nn i out o u t as regards the node level cna measures apart from the in and out degree already mentioned the following indexes can be computed strength igraph strength function of igraph package this is the sum of the weights of the arcs that leave a node out strength s i out j w ij or of the arcs that enter the node in strength s i in j w ji node out efficiency this is the harmonic mean of the geodesic distance from a given node to every other node in the network i e η i out 1 n 1 j i d ij 1 it measures how easy it is to reach any node from that node the average of the node out efficiencies is equal to the network efficiency i e η 1 n i η i out node in efficiency this is the harmonic mean of the geodesic distance to a given node from every other node in the network i e η i in 1 n 1 j i d ji 1 it measures how easy it is to reach that node from any node the average of the node in efficiencies is also equal to the network efficiency i e η 1 n i η i in betweenness centrality igraph betweenness function of igraph package the normalized betweenness centrality of a node i corresponds to the fraction of shortest paths between each pair of nodes of the network that pass through node i averaged for all such pairs of nodes that are distinct from i the unnormalized measures is the sum of the number of shortest path between any pair of nodes that pass through node i i e β i unnormalized j p j i p σ j p i where σ j p i is the number of shortest paths from j to p that pass through i although as indicated above the in and out degree and the in and out strength are local measures their distribution is a global feature thus for example some complex networks have a scale free topology with a power law degree distribution in which most nodes have a very small degree and a few nodes called hubs has a very large degree in other cases like in random networks the degree distribution is more homogeneous with most node having a degree around the average degree when not all the nodes in a network are connected them the network can be partitioned into separate components igraph clusters function of igraph package a component is a connected subgraph i e a subset of nodes so that from each of them one can go to any other of maximal cardinality i e if a node that belongs to the component has a link with some other node that other node also belongs to the component in directed networks one can distinguish between strongly connected components and weakly connected components the former take into account the direction of the arcs while the latter correspond to the associated undirected network formed ignoring the direction of the arcs finally most real word networks have a community structure and that is also a global feature of the network a community also labeled a module corresponds to a cluster of nodes that have more connections among themselves what with nodes outside the community there are many methods for community detection in complex networks see fortunato 2010 for a survey some of those methods like clauset et al 2004 igraph community fastgreedy function of igraph package or blondel et al 2008 igraph community multilevel function of igraph package are based on the optimization of modularity newman 2006 the modularity function igraph modularity function of igraph package is a measure that indicates to what extent a given partition of the nodes represents the actual community structure of the network normally to identify the community structure an undirected network is considered let a c the number of edges within each community c and b c the sum of the degree of all the nodes in community c then the modularity is computed as q c a c m b c 2 m 2 the first term within the brackets is the fraction of edges that actually fall within each community while the second represents the expected number that should fall in that community according to the corresponding null model i e a network with the same number of nodes and edges and the same degree distribution the modularity of the partition that has all nodes as a single community is zero while the modularity of a partition in which each node constitutes a community is negative the larger the value of the modularity of a partition the better that partition matches the actual community structure of the network since the modularity cannot exceed one a partition with a modularity value above 0 3 is generally considered a good fit 4 results the spanish river basin network has 15 nodes and 14 arcs it is a weighted directed network where the weights considered depend on the purpose of the analysis thus it can be either the physical length the capacity of the transfer link or the transfer flow in a specific year or over the whole period table 3 shows some global network characterization measures note that there is no transitivity i e there are no triangles in the network which is reasonable as this would involve expensive and unnecessary connections between already connected nodes there is a small reciprocity due to the existence of some bidirectional links bidirectional links allow either of the two river basins connected to transfer water to the other almost all links are however unidirectional and hence the source and destination of the transfers are fixed the network is sparse i e the number of links is relatively small recall that each link involves a significant investment and hence their number is limited the in degree centralization index is very low but the out degree centralization index is not so recall that the centralization index measures the extent to which the network resembles a star with a central well connected node surrounded by many nodes that are not directly connected among themselves therefore the spanish river basin network shows some similarity with an out star the diameter of the network is rather large 498 1 km this is the largest geodesic distance between any pair of connected nodes the diameter corresponds to the length of the longest transfer that may be carried out in the network the average path length i e the average of the geodesic distances between connected nodes is 167 3 km measured in terms of number of links i e considering the unweighted network the diameter is 4 and the average path length is 1 67 this means that the longest possible transfer would involve four consecutive ibt links table 4 shows the geodesic distances between each pair of nodes the entries correspond to the unconnected pairs of nodes are left blank the bold entry is the network diameter which corresponds to the length of the shortest path between the taj and gdq nodes that shortest path is shown in red in fig 3 it can be seen both in fig 3 and in table 4 that most pairs of nodes are unconnected actually the network has four weakly connected components one of them namely due is a singleton the other three components are taj gdn top gdq cma gbb juc seg i e the river basins in the centre and south of spain ebr cic coc cor i e the river basins in the north and northeast of spain and glc mñs in the northwest of the country fig 4 shows the community structure identified using the fast greedy hierarchical agglomerative algorithm proposed in clauset et al 2004 the right panel of the figure shows the dendrogram that summarizes the agglomerative process in which the nodes are progressively merged into larger clusters by greedily maximizing the modularity improvement in each step the level of the dendrogram that gives the maximum value of modularity q 0 53 corresponds to the seven clusters shown on the left panel note that two of the river basins namely due and cic belong to independent single node clusters due has no connections with any other river basin cic which lies on the northeast of spain receives transfers just from ebr which is grouped in a different cluster together with cor and coc both on the north of spain there is another three node cluster that groups three river basins to the south namely gdq cma and gbb the other river basin on the southwest of pain top is clustered with the river basin that feeds it gdn the two eastern reiver basins juc and seg which are the ones with largest rainfall deficits in the country are grouped with the river basin that supplies to them taj it is interesting to note that there is a single arc connecting each of these three communities indicating that the ibt infrastructure aims at maintaining connectivity at minimum cost finally the two northwest river basins glc and mñs form a separate self sufficient subsystem recall that the northwest is the spanish region with the highest precipitation level fig 5 shows the distribution of the in and out degree it can be seen that due to the high cost of the links most nodes have a low in degree the out degree is however relatively high for some donor river basins namely taj and ebr part of whose hydrological surplus can be transferred to other regions therefore the in degree distribution shows that the river basins receive transfer from one or at most two other basins while the out degree distribution shows that some river basins with surplus water can transfer it to four other river basins the out degree of ebr is five but some of its outgoing links go to the same river basins cic and cor very informative also is the strength distribution thus fig 6 shows for the period 2008 2104 the in and out strength of the different river basins in decreasing order this allows the easy identification of those river basins that receive the largest amounts of water transfers and those that are the largest donors note that although ebr has a larger out degree it is taj that has the largest out strength these two river basins and to a lesser extent gdn and cma constitute the main ibt sources as regards in strength the main receivers of ibt flows are seg in eastern part of spain followed by cor in the north and top in the southwest these correspond with the river basins with the largest deficit between catchment inflows and local demand and that is why they require the largest ibt inflows note also that some river basins with non zero in degree namely ebr mñs coc and gdq have zero in strength this means that that the corresponding ibt infrastructure was not used at all during the period 2008 2014 as regards degree degree correlations fig 7 shows the average out degree of linking neighbours versus the in degree of a node and the average out degree of linked neighbours versus the out degree of a node the positive slope in the first case left panel is indicative of assortativity and means that nodes with larger in degrees receive connections from nodes with higher out degrees i e the river basins with more incoming ibt links feed from the river basins with more outgoing ibt links in the second case right panel the slope is negative and this disassortativity means that the river basins with more outgoing ibt links feed river basins with low outgoing ibt links all this suggests that the system has a two tier structure with some river basins functioning as ibt sources that supply multiple basins and other river basins functioning as ibt receivers that get ibt flows from more than one source in this regard note that although having an in degree larger than one adds flexibility to the ibt system it is costly and hence it is justified only when the availability of water for ibt from a single river basin is not guaranteed and hence it is necessary to diversify the ibt sources we can also look at the correlation between linked nodes in terms of some relevant node attributes such as for example catchment inflows ibt inflows reservoir capacity volume stored in reservoir and total water demand in complex network analysis this is called assortative mixing as shown in table 1 the reservoir capacity has not changed during the period under study and that the annual demand for each river basin is known on average therefore for these two node attributes a single correlation coefficient for the whole period is computed for the other river basin attributes the correlation can be computed also for each year as shown in table 5 most of the assortativity coefficients are negative indicating a disassortative mixing this means that nodes with large demand are often connected with nodes of low demand nodes of large reservoir capacity are often connected with nodes of low reservoir capacity nodes with large volume of water stored in reservoirs are connected with nodes with low volume of water stored and nodes with large ibt inflows are connected with nodes with low ibt inflows all this indicates that the ibt infrastructure has been designed to supply water from the river basins with surplus reservoir capacity to river basins with water deficits in the case of catchment inflows there are both negative and positive assortativity coefficients depending on the year most years all but 2009 and 2010 there was a positive correlation between the catchment inflows of the connected river basins both facing rainfall shortfall or surplus while in 2009 and 2010 the correlation between the catchment inflows of each pair of connected river basins was negative with one of the ends of the connection experiencing more rainfall than the other in this regard note that because of the short term character of the public perception of the water scarcity problem the social and political resistance to ibt normally arises when the donor river basin experiences low rainfall and occurs even if the receiving river basin experiences an even more acute water shortage another interesting cna characterization measure is the network efficiency in the case of the river basin network under study and using the actual lengths in km of the different links it results a rather low network efficiency 0 0026 this is not surprising given to the high cost of building this type of links which precludes the existence of many connections and shortcuts between the nodes fig 8 shows the in and out efficiency of the different nodes in decreasing order and their average i e the network efficiency the river basins with the highest in and out efficiency coincide and their out efficiency is slightly larger than their in efficiency i e their outgoing links are generally shorter than their incoming links there are some exceptions to this rule however thus for gdn cic mñs and due their out efficiency is slightly larger than their in efficiency fig 9 shows the unnormalized betweenness centrality of each node versus its in and out degrees left and right panels respectively the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality namely gdq top and cma are located in the southern part of the country and have an in degree equal to one or two and an out degree equal to one these river basins often lie on the shortest path between two other river basins this means that the water transferred between those two river basins should go through the river basin with the high betweenness centrality this implies that the corresponding ibt infrastructure is doubly utilized by the ibt flows whose destination is the river basin with high betweenness centrality and by the ibt flows that pass through that river basin with a different destination finally fig 10 shows a visualization of the network where the nodes have been placed in the centroid of each river basin the size of each node is proportional to the average catchment inflows during the period under study 2008 2014 thus larger nodes correspond to river basins with large catchment inflows the node colour shows the average percentage of utilization of the corresponding reservoir capacity as regards the arcs their size is proportional to the average flow transferred while their colour shows the percentage of utilization of the corresponding ibt infrastructure it can be seen that the largest ibt flows correspond to the taj seg ebr cor ebr cic gdn top and cma gbb links of these the ebr cor and gdn top are those that make a higher utilization of their ibt capacity the two river basins which supply the largest ibt flows are taj and ebr with the latter having a higher reservoir capacity utilization actually the fact that taj supplies large amounts of ibt flows to many neighbouring river basins in spite of its relatively low level of reservoir utilization generates concerns in the population of that region it is remarkable that due which has the largest catchments inflows of all spanish river basins is an isolated node unconnected with the rest of the system this is due to the orography of this mountainous region which makes it technically and economically unfeasible too build any ibt infrastructure note also that the north of spain has more catchments inflows than the south and the east of the country which are the driest regions most of these river basins have low levels of reservoir capacity utilization it can also be seen in fig 10 why as indicated in fig 9 top gdq and cma have high betweenness centrality followed by gdn and ebr the two tier structure of the system with ebr and taj each acting as centre of an out star with peripheral nodes that in some cases have more than one incoming link is also perceptible the different connected components are clearly visible and also with the help of fig 4 the different communities that form the two largest components 5 conclusions in this paper cna tools and concepts have been used to study and visualize the structure and interrelationships of the spanish river basins and the existing ibt infrastructure this is a novel approach that provides a holistic perspective of the system and at the same time allows assessing the role and centrality of the different nodes of the network thus a number of network characterization measures can be computed such as the density reciprocity centralization index average path length and diameter efficiency etc the picture these measures draw is of a sparse network with low reciprocity zero transitivity four components one of them formed by just a single unconnected node relatively large average path length and diameter and low efficiency most of these features can be explained by the high cost of establishing links between the nodes the out degree distribution is broader maximum out degree 5 than the in degree distribution maximum in degree 2 i e there are a few river basins namely ebr and taj that each supply ibt flows to a relatively large number of receiver river basins while those receiver river basins have incoming links from at most two of these source river basins the cna results also indicate that the ibt infrastructure has been designed to supply water from the river basins with surplus reservoir capacity to river basins with water deficits and that the system has a two tier structure with some river basins functioning as ibt sources that supply multiple basins and other river basins functioning as ibt receivers that get ibt flows from more than one source this diversification of ibt sourcing implies that the availability of water for ibt from a single river basin is not guaranteed a neat community structure involving seven small clusters of two or three nodes generally has also been identified it is interesting to note that in most cases there is a single arc connecting these communities indicating that the ibt infrastructure aims at maintaining connectivity at minimum cost the in and out strength distributions clearly identify the main source and recipient river basins of the ibt flows they also show that some river basins with incoming ibt links have not made any use of them during the period under study the in and out efficiency of each node and its contribution to the overall network efficiency have also been determined and the nodes with high betweenness centrality have been identified in summary this study has carried out a thorough and insightful analysis of the spanish river basin system and their ibt interconnections it can be concluded that the topology and characteristics of the network are a consequence of the imbalances created by the varying climatic conditions of the river basins the water storage capacity provided by the existing reservoir infrastructure the geographical and orographic constraints of the country and the high cost of establishing links between neighbouring river basins as a continuation of this research a more fine grained study considering the different sub drainage basins that form each drainage basin is planned also a similar study on a larger scale e g the european river basins would be desirable in this regard it is anticipated that the largest difficulty that would be faced is that of data collection credit

dissolution or anthropogenic factors harvesting underground deposits such as oil gas and intensive gw extraction bouwer 1978 phi and strokova 2015 subsequently because of a drop in gwl other phenomena including subsidence may occur due to the loss of water from aquifer system and compaction of the soil therefore it is necessary to assess the impact of lucc on gwl variations and consequently on the land subsidence this is a systemic view in which the change in a component of the system affects its other components in other words changes in the atmosphere e g climate change cc or the biosphere e g land use change luc may affect first the hydrosphere and then the physical properties of the soil e g lithosphere rigorous studies about the impact of lucc whether in combination or individually e g luc or cc have been reported on hydrological processes molina navarro et al 2014 nourani et al 2015 hydrological processes and erosive response serpa et al 2015 fire risk moriondo et al 2006 vegetation frate et al 2018 water quality serpa et al 2017 forest expansion alvarez martınez et al 2014 gw variability gamvroudis et al 2017 however to the best of our knowledge no study has scrutinized lucc effects on subsidence linked to the hydrological process and gwl changes in this study the synthetic aperture radar interferometry insar small baseline subset sbas time series analysis method and soil and water assessment tool swat are used in order to examine the occurrence risk of subsidence at marand plain located north of tabriz city of northwestern iran under different lucc scenarios in this way first subsidence was monitored by insar from 2003 12 to 2006 03 and from 2015 05 to 2015 10 and then the changes in gwl and subsidence for the period of 2003 2006 were assessed to sketch a meaningful relationship between gwl decrease and land deformation secondly the swat model for the region was calibrated by the available historical data and then a range of scenarios were simulated to determine gwl condition at baseline and 5 different lucc scenarios finally using the results of swat for different scenarios and the sketched relationship between gwl condition and land subsidence the marand plain subsidence were inferred under different lucc scenarios for near future of 2030 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the marand plain where the gw is severely overused was chosen as the study extent the plain is located within the zilbier river basin where the zilbier river passes through the plain and is located 70 km north of tabriz city most of the basin area is located in the east azerbaijan province and approximately 10 of its area is in the west azerbaijan province of northwestern iran fig 1 the plain has an area of 826 km2 in which misho and moro mountains in the south and boghdagh and ghalehdagh mountains are located in the north of the plain the marand plain consists of quaternary sediments there are three confined semi confined and unconfined aquifers in the plain which are formed in the young old alluvial and alluvial fans and river deposit the alluvial aquifers of the basin are located in the quaternary units of the plain these units include recent alluvium salt zones alluvium with farming lu alluvial fans young alluvium terraces and old fans the average annual temperature of the plain is 11 4 c and average annual precipitation of 247 mm has been recorded the climate in the region based on de martonne climatic classification is semi arid and cold winter types recent studies on cc in the mediterranean region including marand indicate an increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation especially in summer candela et al 2012 molina navarro et al 2014 nevertheless in the northwest of iran increasing temperatures and declining rainfall are observed in all seasons especially in winter imo 2006a b in the last decade cc in combination with luc have led to severe increase in water use through cultivation and transfer of dry farming or pasture to the irrigated farming and a general decrease of gw in the mediterranean region ertürk et al 2014 pulido velazquez et al 2015 these issues are associated with all plains of iran including marand plain earw 1997 2015 agriculture is the most important economic sector of the marand plain especially during the last two decades fao 2008 and around 90 of the available water resource is used by the agricultural sector ardakanian 2005 2 2 assessment of lucc effects on land subsidence workflow although there are different reasons for the land subsidence e g tectonic movements gw extraction the main reason is restricted to the gwl decline the proposed methodology in this study is based on the combination of insar functionality with sbas method for land subsidence monitoring and hydrological modeling by the swat fig 2 schematically presents the methodology of the current study the integrated approach fundamentally depends on three interrelated methodological stages the first stage contains the determination of the deformation rate at 2 different periods i e 2003 2006 and 2014 2015 fitting a linear regression between subsidence rate and gwl in 2003 2006 and comparing land deformation time series and gwl time series to control the timing of the land subsidence include the vertical diffusivity and the thickness of the fine grained sediments the second stage as hydrological modeling set out to contain sensitivity analysis calibration validation and simulation by swat in the third stage the outputs of swat simulations under different lucc scenarios are investigated to derive the relationship between gws and land subsidence the details and components of the stages shown in fig 2 are described in the next sections of the paper including data sources i e observation and radar data and the methodology for radar remote sensing analysis subsequent sections present the hydrologic model considering five different future scenarios land use data and the performance criteria the results obtained through the proposed modeling framework are then presented and discussed followed by concluding remarks 2 3 subsidence time series analysis to analyze the land deformation time series 15c band envisat asar data 2003 2006 and 12 interferometric wide swath iws c band sentinel 1 2014 2015 were used in the insar small baseline subset sbas time series analysis method as shown in table 1 in total 27 descending single look complex slc images were handled under pre defined conditions of envisat asar and sentinel 1 to produce 37 and 46 differential interferograms respectively for both datasets the temporal baseline was limited to fewer than 180 days and the maximum spatial baseline was limited to less than 400 the use of pre defined temporal and spatial threshold allows avoiding de correlation effects in the processed interferograms when master and slave images are placed on the same geometric frame i e co registered the phase difference is calculated between master and slave images namely interferogram the multi looking analysis is performed to reduce the level of speckle noise in slc images and increases the coherence ratio in the interferograms the master images were chosen in such a way to create the maximum number of connections between radar images dehghani et al 2009 milillo et al 2016 karimzadeh et al 2018 goldstein filter was used to reduce the noise that may otherwise make it difficult to unwrap individual phases goldstein et al 1993 then due to the restriction of the interferometric phases produced between π and π phase unwrapping was applied to calculate the absolute value of the phase with respect to a reference point within the interferogram it should be noticed that the insar is able to measure the deformation along the line of sight los since the subsidence is a phenomenon with a dominant vertical displacement component the horizontal component is usually ignored one might prove this through los deformation decomposition into its components using interferograms with different geometries i e ascending and descending by ignoring the horizontal deformation component the los deformation was projected into the vertical direction using the incidence angle accordingly the results produced from different datasets can be compared together in spite of their different imaging geometries the short term as well as long term behavior of the subsidence were examined using the sbas time series analysis method proposed by dehghani et al 2009 in this method after processing the differential interferograms characterized by small baselines the interferograms are inverted in the least square process to estimate the deformation at each acquisition date the time series analysis was performed for envisat asar and sentinel 1 separately the first acquisition of each dataset i e 2003 12 17 and 2015 05 03 was considered as a reference date in time series analysis moreover all interferograms calculated from envisat asar and sentinel 1 images were calibrated according to a spatial reference point which it is explained later in the results and discussion section in order to mitigate the atmospheric effect which has a de correlated behavior in time a smoothing constraint was incorporated into the least square solution using a smoothing factor dehghani et al 2009 the smoothing factor was optimally determined in order to reduce the atmospheric effect while not damping out the seasonal deformation fluctuations using the sbas time series analysis the subsidence time series and the annual rate corresponding to the envisat asar 26 months and sentinel 1 6 months temporal coverage were extracted it should be mentioned that the two time series were analyzed separately due to the lack of independent information on subsidence rate within the temporal gap between both datasets i e 2006 2014 in order to find out the continuation of subsidence sentinel 1 dataset was used in 2015 there are several limiting factors in the radar interferometry technique the interferograms characterized by large spatial and temporal baselines may be contaminated by de correlation noise therefore 16 envisat asar and 10 sentinel 1 coherent interferograms were pre processed as presented in table 2 2 4 piezometric data in order to investigate gwl variations thirteen wells were considered in this study based on the completeness of their data and distribution on the plain fig 1 the gwls in the aquifers have been recorded every month at the period of 1997 2015 earw using the hierarchy algorithm of the ward model ward and joe 1963 and observed gwl data the wells were divided into three clusters to consider only the centroid well of each cluster as the representative of that cluster in the next stages of the modeling after clustering all wells with the same cluster may be regarded to have almost the same behavior therefore all wells were not investigated and the centroid well of each cluster was further considered to perform the investigation but the same method can be applied for all wells as well see for details shargi et al 2018 fig 3 indicates the allocation of wells in 3 clusters via ward method which places eight wells in the first cluster w4 as the centroid well one well in the second cluster w9 and four wells in the third cluster w11 as the centroid well also two dried wells were considered to investigate land subsidence rate after drying d w1 and d w2 2 5 application of swat the swat model swat 2012 revision 637 is a river basin scale catchment model originally reported by arnold et al 1998 it can be used to study the plausible impacts of lucc and also different methods of land management on river water quality and quantity and agricultural chemical matters in drainage basins milano et al 2013 bucak et al 2017 in swat the drainage basin is further divided into sub basins using the dem afterwards hydrologic response units hrus which are unique combinations of soil type land use and slope are created see fig 2 the total amount of runoff sur q is simulated through the individual sub basins after calculating and routing the runoff independently for each hru in this study monthly sur q was simulated by the soil conservation service curve number scs cn for moisture condition ii approach which is a function of the soil s permeability antecedent soil water condition and land use neitsch et al 2011 and evapotranspiration through the hargreaves method since the orchard and agriculture crops need irrigation in zilbier basin the water for them was supplied from the rivers and shallow aquifer in swat model the hydrological balance is calculated following the general equation of arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r d q su e b w se q g where sw t is the soil water content at time t mm r d is the rain on day i q su is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e b is the evapotranspiration on day i mm w se is the infiltration out of the soil profile on day i mm q g is the amount of return flow on day i mm and sw 0 is the initial soil water content the water balance for the shallow aquifer for the land phase of each sub basin is derived as 2 aq sg i aq sg i 1 w rg s g q g w r w pp s g where aq sg i is the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer on day i mm w rg s g is the amount of recharge entering the shallow aquifer on day i mm q g is the gw flow or base flow into the main channel on day i mm w r is the amount of water moving into the soil zone in response to water deficiencies on day i mm and w pp s g is the amount of water removed from the shallow aquifer by pumping on day i mm the various quantities were calculated by swat model based on table 3 2 5 1 sensitivity analysis and model calibration and validation the sufi 2 approach performed in the swat cup software package was used for primary sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2004 the sensitive parameters were subsequently designed for calibration the simulation of monthly discharge was most sensitive to the following four parameters cn2 scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii soil evaporation compensation factor esco available water capacity of the soil layer mm sol awc and deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp in this study calibration was implemented on a monthly basis the model was calibrated for 1990 1994 5 years after an initial 5 year model warm up period 1985 1989 and subsequently validated for period of 2007 2011 after an initial 5 years warm up for 2002 2006 respectively the model was tested for 1985 1994 based on land use map of 1987 and for 2002 2011 based on land use map of 2007 information about land use and its forecasting has been explained in section 2 5 2 there are two hydrological gauges for the measurement of discharge in the region main outlet and sub outlet see fig 1 the data from these gauges were used for the calibration 1990 to 1994 and validation 2007 to 2011 of the model in swat cup format the efficiency of swat model was evaluated quantitatively using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the correlation coefficient r2 the percent bias pbias and the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr based on the review by moriasi et al 2007 see table 4 table 5 represents the calibration and the validation results the quantitative assessment of model efficiency using nse r2 pbias and rsr showed good or very good efficiency during calibration for both the main and sub outlet gauges hydrological gauges based on fig 1 in relation to the criteria listed in moriasi et al 2007 validation of main outlet data based on pbias was good for the period of 2007 2011 the results indicated that the swat model had some difficulties in simulating the dynamics at small scale for the study area because the results were unsatisfactory for the small sub outlet during the validation period see table 5 this may be due to local rainfall events which were not considered at the 7 rainfall gauges used for the entire basin the sub outlet however represents only 1 8 of the whole basin and as such the basin wide data that were evaluated in the lucc scenarios could still be representative for the wider basin 2 5 2 land use data land use data were derived from landsat data for 1987 2007 and 2015 by object oriented method andaryani et al 2019 land use was classified into 10 classes water alfalfa orchard rain fed agriculture residential forest strong pasture weak pasture irrigated wheat and irrigated agriculture then land use was predicted for 2030 based on the derived land use andaryani et al 2019 table 6 presents the area of land uses and luc distributions for different years of 1987 2007 2015 and 2030 these areas however belong to the whole zilbier river basin according to table 6 the dominant land use classes are weak pasture with a coverage of 72 and strong pasture with a coverage of 12 respectively classes of alfalfa orchard irrigated wheat and irrigated agriculture which are high consumption yield crops especially orchard have severely been developed until 2015 although in the whole area i e zilbier river basin high consumption yield crops do not have very wide coverage in the study region the most area belongs to them in the land use classes the apricot crop made up the higher area of fruit trees and the irrigated agriculture mainly belonged to tomato and sunflower iranian ministry of jahade agriculture moja 2007 table 7 shows water consumption of each type of land use for lu forecasting the land use class changes between 1987 and 2007 were first obtained through the cross tab method in order to predict the land use map of 2015 afterwards the binary dependent layer was prepared for all classes and independent layers of altitude slope aspect soil geology distance from road and distance from river in order to enter the logistic regression model and then the effect of each independent layer was determined on the dependent layer class changes afterwards the result of the logistic regression model prediction was introduced to the cellular automata markov cam model as the transition suitability layer marcovian transition estimator mondal and southworth 2010 was used for land use map of 1987 and 2007 in order to determine the probability of change in the areas of the individual classes and finally the land use map of 2007 was introduced to cam model as a basis for prediction of land use map of 2015 and the size of neighborhood filter was considered as 5 5 pixels the obtained result of the classified land use map was validated through the roc model li et al 2012 according to the acceptability of roc result 75 the above mentioned method was considered to create the land use map of 2007 and 2015 and the map of 2030 was then predicted for more details see andaryani et al 2019 fig 4 2 5 3 lucc scenarios for future the effects of lucc scenarios on gws were assessed by comparing swat outputs of baseline and 5 main scenarios climate scenarios for 2030 were generated by applying the delta change approach andaryani et al 2019 where the climatic trends in air temperature and precipitation from either 1985 2014 low delta change ldc or 2005 2014 high delta change hdc periods were used for computing yearly delta factors the latter period resulting in larger changes see fig 5 it should be mentioned that a significant increase for march pcp in hdc tall spike of fig 5 is due to the severe increasing pcp in this month in the period of 2005 2014 4 6 mm yr andaryani et al 2019 the changes in temperature and precipitation were then applied to the 15 year period of the baseline data 2005 2014 using 2000 2004 as a model primary warm up to assess the individual and potentially synergistic effects of lucc a series of simulation scenarios were schemed where these changes were either run individually i e s1 s3 or combined i e s4 and s5 see table 8 3 results and discussion the time series of mean gwl in the aquifer averaged over all piezometers data and for the centroid piezometers of the clusters have been plotted in fig 6 according to fig 6a the average gwl has declined over 19 years by 5 m in the whole aquifer the centroid piezometer of the first cluster i e w4 fig 3 indicates up to 6 m gwl drop in the period from 1997 to 2015 fig 6b the trend line in the centroid piezometer of the second cluster i e w9 fig 3 is reduced about 29 m fig 6c and in the third one i e w11 fig 3 a 2 m increase is seen fig 5d in the third cluster severe gwl fluctuations are clear but in other clusters the gwl reduction is smooth regarding the type of aquifer wells of cluster 1 are located in the confined semi confined and unconfined aquifers and the second cluster is located in the confined aquifer however the area for most of the wells in the third cluster fig 6d is located on the unconfined aquifer and parts of its wells are fed by nearby mountains see fig 3 which shows the position of wells relative to elevation for this reason there is not significant gwl dropping in wells of cluster 3 but also gwl raising can be seen in the wells of this cluster in the next stages of modeling the third cluster was not considered since the aim of this study was to sketch the relationship between gwl drop and land subsidence whereas the wells of this cluster experience gwl increase two wells of the first cluster w1 is located in semi confined aquifer and w4 is located in a confined aquifer were considered to investigate the relationship between gwl drop and land subsidence because it seems the area of this cluster is vast according to fig 3 and probably there are spatial variations in lithology soil and types of aquifers in this cluster 3 1 land deformation to interpret the temporal variations of land subsidence envisat asar and sentinel 1 satellite data were used and the subsidence rate of the study site was obtained sbas time series analysis of the envisat asar and sentinel 1 was performed separately to estimate the subsidence time series in two different periods i e 2003 2006 and 2015 the result of the average displacement using envisat asar and sentinel 1 shows the existence of both uplift and subsidence phenomena in the plain based on the same spatial reference point fig 7 a and b land uplift can be due to atmospheric effects a faulty recovery phase dehghani et al 2013 or even aquifer recharging dong et al 2013 dai et al 2015 due to natural e g hydrology cycle or artificial e g management changes of the aquifer since there is no aquifer recharging in marand plain except in the region of the third cluster it seems that land uplift in the region of the first and second clusters is due to atmospheric effects or fault recovery phase based on fig 7a 24 cm and a 39 cm negative deformation could be seen during 26 months and 6 months respectively and therefore 3141 ha of the area have been affected by land subsidence in confined semi confined and unconfined aquifers this area was calculated using pixels area which had been affected by land subsidence however the high rate subsidence area is mostly located in the confined aquifer in both time series this can be due to the aquifer compression with water removed from the confined aquifer removing of large volumes of water can result in significant ground subsidence the wells in the marand plain which experiences severe land subsidence rate have completely dried out e g d w1 and d w2 in fig 3 these wells are located in the region of the first cluster which is not renewed by other water sources it is considered that there were 60 piezometric in marand plain which 10 have dried out in the recent decade frwmo 2008 furthermore pumping practices have not been modified and following current policies other wells in clusters 1 and 2 may also be gradually drying out in near future see gwl drop rate in fig 6a and b according to fig 8 signs such as the destruction of wells buildings bending of electricity network pillars separation of walls and breaking of walls indicate deformations in the marand plain these signs can be evidence of the occurrence of subsidence anywhere in the world phien wej et al 1998 phi and strokova 2015 furthermore in the last decade several severe floods have occurred in this area frwmo 2010 severe flood can be a sign of negative vertical deformation in the region usgs 2011 in a way that it is compressed and loses its percolation rate because of the subsidence fig 9 indicates the rate of land subsidence by time series analysis of envisat asar relative to gwl decline and sentinel 1 interferograms in the selected wells positions if the hydraulic conductivity of compressible sediments of the aquitards is low there is a time delay between the water table decline and compaction of the sediments in order to find the time delay the subsidence time series were compared to the gwl time series by the correlation coefficient considering zero one and two months lag times the value of the correlation coefficient is 0 76 0 51 0 53 for w1 in zero one and two lag times respectively 0 79 0 56 0 37 for w4 in zero one and two lag times respectively and 0 63 0 40 0 44 for w9 in zero one and two lag times respectively the result shows that the lag between these time series is less than one month a linear relationship between the land deformation and gwl was derived for w1 fig 9b w4 fig 9c and w9 fig 9d but for wells d w1 and d w2 such relation could not be extracted as these wells have been dried out during 2003 2006 fig 9a the results indicate a strong and positive correlation between the land subsidence and the gwl drop with average correlation coefficient of 0 73 that this result is consistent with the conclusions of jeanne et al 2018 who indicated that land subsidence occurred in areas where the density of groundwater wells is the highest fig 9e shows land deformation extracted from sentinel 1 since the period of sentinel 1 datasets are in gwl depletion time may october the rate of subsidence is higher than that extracted from envisat asar the rate of subsidence in 2015 was not used in the modeling however the result was used to find out the continuation of subsidence in the study area severe land subsidence could be seen in the region where wells are drying out this sign suggests that when water is extracted and removed from the fine grained and highly compressible sediments such as clay and silt aquifer inter beds are compressed and the land subsidence occurs hoffmann et al 2003 dehghani et al 2009 in fig 9b e the differences in the regression coefficients a in y ax b obtained for different parts of the region can be due to the differences in lithology profiles and soil type which are the most effective factors for the soil resistance therefore the extensive withdrawal of gw may not be the sole reason of the land subsidence and hydrogeology may also control the rate of this phenomenon thus although the gwl has significantly dropped in w4 and w9 about 3 m and 6 m respectively in 26 months land subsidence has mostly occurred in the region around well w4 in other words the rate of subsidence is 6 cm yr and 7 cm yr in the region around wells w4 and w9 respectively although the gwl reduction has been almost doubled in w9 with regard to w4 this result is consistent with the conclusions of dehghani et al 2013 for other plains of iran but it differs from the results of solaimani and mortazavi 2008 who emphasized that land subsidence happens due to considerable withdrawal of gwl therefore for the region of the w1 w4 and w9 wells respectively about 8 cm 4 cm and 2 6 cm vertical displacements could be observed for one meter of gwl drop this result differs with the results obtained by solaimani and mortazavi 2008 which reported 5 15 cm land subsidence rate for each meter drop of gwl for rafsanjan plain due to the spatial variations in lithology soil and types of aquifers 3 2 comparing the gwl and gws variations after sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of swat gws of the plain area was simulated to compare long term simulated gws and observed gwl variations fig 10 compares the trend between gwl observation and gws modeling for the piezometers of the first and second clusters w1 w4 and w9 since in the present study gw reserve parameters were not calibrated in swat due to the lack of ability of swat in simulating gw thus by comparing the piezometric level of wells and the amount of gws in the corresponding hru of that well their temporal variations in terms of increasing or decreasing trend could be verified swat simulates gws rather than gwl we do not attempt to make a direct mathematical relationship between gwl and gws but we know there is a strong direct conceptual relationship between them fig 10 shows that the variation in simulated gws and observed gwl are highly consistent hence supporting that the simulated signals of gws in our scenarios are also representative of the likely changes in gwl in these scenarios since the decline rate of both gws and gwl is similar the gwl decline rate was replaced with gws decline rate obtained by swat to compute gw decline rate to make a regression based equation with deformation fig 9 it seems that calibration of gw parameters was needed in order to decrease uncertainty and harmonize the behavior between two variables observed and simulated 3 3 impacts of lucc scenarios on gws and consequently on land subsidence the monthly gws of the plain were simulated by swat for 5 different scenarios table 9 shows the percentages decrease of gws in the different scenarios s1 s5 with regard to the baseline scenario sb for scenario s1 which considers no change in temperature and precipitation but a land use change up to 2030 the amount of gws will be reduced about 31 67 and 79 in wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively considering cc based on the ldc and no change in land use s2 this will reduce gws up to 23 44 and 63 for wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively via scenario s3 which considers both precipitation and temperature changes cc variations based on the hdc but no change of land use i e land use of 2007 about 71 81 and 93 reduction in gws will occur in wells w1 w4 and w9 respectively by combining land use and cc in 2030 at scenario 4 the ldc factor a decline of 52 94 and 99 of gws is predicted in wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively finally for scenario s5 which considers both lucc based on the hdc a decline of 82 99 and 100 in gws is expected for wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively the well w9 may be dried out by 2025 there is no gws in the hru for the period of 2025 2030 however other wells also do not seem to be in a satisfactory situation under the scenario s5 the severe reduction in gws caused by extra withdrawal for irrigation can obviously impact the local gwl in other words all scenarios indicated very strong effects of lucc on gws the effect which may be evident within the next two decades especially in s4 and s5 scenarios in this study water use for irrigation causes a drop in gws due to an increase in the orchard land use and irrigated agriculture which are high consumption yield crops moja 2007 fig 11 shows the increase of area related to the orchard irrigated agriculture alfalfa and residential land uses however the decline in area of irrigated wheat is clear in 2030 which is low consumption yield crop see table 7 for this reason scenario s1 has a more severe impact on the drop of gws relative to scenario s2 comparing the results of scenarios s1 and s3 by 2030 shows that with regard to the luc cc has prominent effect on the rate decrease of gws in the cc future scenarios there has been no change in gw harvesting in other words when temperature is increasing which is shown in fig 5 it is expected that water used for animals plants and humans is also increased and in the case of a decrease in surface water resources significantly reduced in this area gw will experience a strong pressure it should be noted that water consumption for households and municipal use was not considered due to their low consumption levels 10 relative to the agricultural consumption 90 moja 2007 cc can decrease aquifer recharge rate and increase gw demand for irrigation supply in arid and semi arid areas e g marand plain by any change in precipitation evapotranspiration snow accumulation and snow melt charles 2016 in the study area there is a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature soltani et al 2016 consequently increasing in evapotranspiration has made a high demand for irrigation and aquifer recharge reduction for these reasons wells for irrigation in the marand plain have increased up to 30 spatially in the last decade frwmo 2008 and gw supply in the plain is severely decreasing until 2030 by lucc in the swat modeling the water resources used for irrigation in the scenarios and baseline were kept constant and taken from either rivers or gw sources i e shallow aquifer hence for the regions with no water available in rivers or shallow wells the crop yield will decline in the modeling therefore managing the crop yield based on crop performance and change of water resource type from well to river and vice versa can improve the results of calibration nevertheless due to the strong relationship between gw decline and land subsidence if land use and climate changes continue based on considered scenarios in the present study the average negative displacement in the study area will be increased based on table 10 the amount of land subsidence is represented in table 10 for different scenarios up to 2030 the impact of luc on the land subsidence rate is greater than cc based on the ldc scenarios s1 vs s2 however this issue is reversed when cc is based on hdc factors scenarios s1 vs s3 in investigated wells according to scenarios s4 and s5 which consider both luc and cc lucc variations based on the ldc and hdc about 1 13 m land subsidence will occur in the wells although the land subsidence in scenarios s4 and s5 is similar in w9 hru see table 10 due to elongation of land subsidence in regions around dried wells land subsidence around this hru in scenario s5 may be more severe than scenario s4 for two study periods 2003 12 2015 10 and 2015 05 2015 10 about 3141 ha have been affected by land subsidence which will certainly increase in the future based on the proposed methodology in the present study it can be noted that artificial recharge and management of the gw withdrawal may reduce gwl damages artificial recharge can be used to control and store water underground in periods of water surplus to use in periods of shortage it can also control land subsidence caused by declining gwl maintain base flow in some streams and raise water levels to reduce the cost of ground water pumping in general assessing the results of the scenarios indicate that there is no linear relationship between the gws variations and land subsidence rate it seems that other hydrogeological factors i e lithology and soil may also affect the land subsidence rate 4 conclusions in the present study insar sbas time series analysis and the swat model were used to explore the effects of lucc on gwl decrease and to examine the effect of this decline on the land subsidence of the marand plain which is a strategic area in iran employing the sbas method and analyzing the images of envisat asar and sentinel 1 during a 2 periods i e 2003 12 2006 03 and 2015 5 2015 10 it was found that 3141 ha of the marand plain have undergone some degrees of land subsidence fig 7 such subsidence damaged building structures including structures around wells walls of settlements and concrete around canals and power rails the maximum subsidence rate of the study area ranges 24 cm and 39 cm over the 26 months and 6 months respectively because of the direct relationship between gwl decline and subsidence rate fig 10b d gws obtained by the swat model was used to determine the lucc effects at different scenarios on gws and consequently on the subsidence of the plain area changes in lu and cc were considered based on the trends in recent historical observations it was found that the effect of cc is more severe compared to that of luc considering both changes in the future 81 7 and 93 6 percent of the gws in the region under the ldc and hdc conditions will be decreased respectively because of the direct relationship between gwl decline and land subsidence the area that will be affected by land subsidence will increase and the vertical movement of the ground surface will result in an average of 5 cm increase in subsidence for each meter of gw decline the results of this study illustrate that the prepared framework can be used to efficiently monitor the lucc effect on water and soil resources update land subsidence tables and monitor land subsidence behavior the results of this research will be helpful for risk analyzers and environmental management of the study site future work may also address the integration of this framework with groundwater models e g modflow linked to swat for simulating more spatially explicit gwl in order to conceive the spatial uncertainty of results finally preventing further gws losses and the hydrologic consequences associated with such losses should be a critical preference for state water managers and artificial

6143,the impact of land use and climate change lucc on the pattern of groundwater and land subsidence at the marand plain was investigated in this study earth deformation was derived from envisat asar 2003 12 17 2006 03 01 and sentinel 1 2015 05 03 2015 10 18 satellite data via the synthetic aperture radar interferometry insar small baseline subset sbas time series analysis method time series analysis results showed the maximum deformation rate of 24 and 39 cm yr extracted from envisat asar and sentinel 1 respectively about 3141 ha of the plain area have been affected by the subsidence phenomenon which has caused severe damage to constructions observed groundwater level gwl observed data indicate a reduction of five meters on average for the period of 1997 2015 linear regression was derived between gwl abatement and subsidence with average correlation coefficient of 0 73 and the rate of subsidence was about 2 6 8 cm for a one meter drop in the gwl owing to the obtained relations between gwl reduction and subsidence the effects of lucc on groundwater storage gws variability and consequently the plain subsidence was studied using the soil and water assessment tool swat climate change scenarios were represented by the delta change approach based on the trend for the past three 1985 2014 and last decade 2005 2014 respectively by low delta change ldc and high delta change hdc where the trend of the most recent decade yield a higher delta change when extrapolating into 2030 after calibration and validation of the swat model using the monthly flow data baseline sb and five different lucc scenarios s1 s5 were simulated and their effects on the gws variability were compared with together the simulated results of sb vs s4 and s5 which represent plausible scenarios show that lucc may decrease gws about 52 99 and 85 100 under ldc and hdc respectively the results of the scenarios show the significant value of climate change cc under hdc compared to land use change luc in the diminishing of the gws and as a result the severe occurrence of the subsidence in the region keywords land use and climate change subsidence groundwater level small baseline subset swat marand plain 1 introduction groundwater gw is one of the largest fresh water reservoirs and a source of survival for living organisms around the world gw is an important resource for agriculture human consumption industry tourism and environmental requirements sophocleous 2004 kustu et al 2010 in order to achieve a sustainable development it is necessary to consider the conservation of gw resources and related social economic and agricultural factors with the growth of population and economic development a severe gap has occurred between supply and demand for water resources as people have started to extract more water from gw resources for this reason the severe decline in gw level gwl due to land use and climate change lucc has become a growing problem globally rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2012 zou et al 2015 lucc affect the quantity and quality of gw by influencing the hydrological processes of the watershed these processes are altered because of changes in climate variables e g temperature and precipitation zhang et al 2017 and gw exploitation in other words following the increase in air temperature due to the concentration of greenhouse gases and fluctuations of the precipitation and withdrawal of gw changes in hydrological processes have been occurred mostly over the last three decades arnell and reynard 1996 yan et al 2015 on the other hand uncontrolled extraction of gw has caused subsidence of the plains and imposed irreparable effects on the land surface of different regions of the world in the recent years especially in plains composed of quaternary and undeveloped sediments motagh et al 2009 osmanoglu 2011 dehghani et al 2013 poland 1984 deformation may happen due to natural factors e g tectonic movements sediment compaction and dissolution or anthropogenic factors harvesting underground deposits such as oil gas and intensive gw extraction bouwer 1978 phi and strokova 2015 subsequently because of a drop in gwl other phenomena including subsidence may occur due to the loss of water from aquifer system and compaction of the soil therefore it is necessary to assess the impact of lucc on gwl variations and consequently on the land subsidence this is a systemic view in which the change in a component of the system affects its other components in other words changes in the atmosphere e g climate change cc or the biosphere e g land use change luc may affect first the hydrosphere and then the physical properties of the soil e g lithosphere rigorous studies about the impact of lucc whether in combination or individually e g luc or cc have been reported on hydrological processes molina navarro et al 2014 nourani et al 2015 hydrological processes and erosive response serpa et al 2015 fire risk moriondo et al 2006 vegetation frate et al 2018 water quality serpa et al 2017 forest expansion alvarez martınez et al 2014 gw variability gamvroudis et al 2017 however to the best of our knowledge no study has scrutinized lucc effects on subsidence linked to the hydrological process and gwl changes in this study the synthetic aperture radar interferometry insar small baseline subset sbas time series analysis method and soil and water assessment tool swat are used in order to examine the occurrence risk of subsidence at marand plain located north of tabriz city of northwestern iran under different lucc scenarios in this way first subsidence was monitored by insar from 2003 12 to 2006 03 and from 2015 05 to 2015 10 and then the changes in gwl and subsidence for the period of 2003 2006 were assessed to sketch a meaningful relationship between gwl decrease and land deformation secondly the swat model for the region was calibrated by the available historical data and then a range of scenarios were simulated to determine gwl condition at baseline and 5 different lucc scenarios finally using the results of swat for different scenarios and the sketched relationship between gwl condition and land subsidence the marand plain subsidence were inferred under different lucc scenarios for near future of 2030 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the marand plain where the gw is severely overused was chosen as the study extent the plain is located within the zilbier river basin where the zilbier river passes through the plain and is located 70 km north of tabriz city most of the basin area is located in the east azerbaijan province and approximately 10 of its area is in the west azerbaijan province of northwestern iran fig 1 the plain has an area of 826 km2 in which misho and moro mountains in the south and boghdagh and ghalehdagh mountains are located in the north of the plain the marand plain consists of quaternary sediments there are three confined semi confined and unconfined aquifers in the plain which are formed in the young old alluvial and alluvial fans and river deposit the alluvial aquifers of the basin are located in the quaternary units of the plain these units include recent alluvium salt zones alluvium with farming lu alluvial fans young alluvium terraces and old fans the average annual temperature of the plain is 11 4 c and average annual precipitation of 247 mm has been recorded the climate in the region based on de martonne climatic classification is semi arid and cold winter types recent studies on cc in the mediterranean region including marand indicate an increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation especially in summer candela et al 2012 molina navarro et al 2014 nevertheless in the northwest of iran increasing temperatures and declining rainfall are observed in all seasons especially in winter imo 2006a b in the last decade cc in combination with luc have led to severe increase in water use through cultivation and transfer of dry farming or pasture to the irrigated farming and a general decrease of gw in the mediterranean region ertürk et al 2014 pulido velazquez et al 2015 these issues are associated with all plains of iran including marand plain earw 1997 2015 agriculture is the most important economic sector of the marand plain especially during the last two decades fao 2008 and around 90 of the available water resource is used by the agricultural sector ardakanian 2005 2 2 assessment of lucc effects on land subsidence workflow although there are different reasons for the land subsidence e g tectonic movements gw extraction the main reason is restricted to the gwl decline the proposed methodology in this study is based on the combination of insar functionality with sbas method for land subsidence monitoring and hydrological modeling by the swat fig 2 schematically presents the methodology of the current study the integrated approach fundamentally depends on three interrelated methodological stages the first stage contains the determination of the deformation rate at 2 different periods i e 2003 2006 and 2014 2015 fitting a linear regression between subsidence rate and gwl in 2003 2006 and comparing land deformation time series and gwl time series to control the timing of the land subsidence include the vertical diffusivity and the thickness of the fine grained sediments the second stage as hydrological modeling set out to contain sensitivity analysis calibration validation and simulation by swat in the third stage the outputs of swat simulations under different lucc scenarios are investigated to derive the relationship between gws and land subsidence the details and components of the stages shown in fig 2 are described in the next sections of the paper including data sources i e observation and radar data and the methodology for radar remote sensing analysis subsequent sections present the hydrologic model considering five different future scenarios land use data and the performance criteria the results obtained through the proposed modeling framework are then presented and discussed followed by concluding remarks 2 3 subsidence time series analysis to analyze the land deformation time series 15c band envisat asar data 2003 2006 and 12 interferometric wide swath iws c band sentinel 1 2014 2015 were used in the insar small baseline subset sbas time series analysis method as shown in table 1 in total 27 descending single look complex slc images were handled under pre defined conditions of envisat asar and sentinel 1 to produce 37 and 46 differential interferograms respectively for both datasets the temporal baseline was limited to fewer than 180 days and the maximum spatial baseline was limited to less than 400 the use of pre defined temporal and spatial threshold allows avoiding de correlation effects in the processed interferograms when master and slave images are placed on the same geometric frame i e co registered the phase difference is calculated between master and slave images namely interferogram the multi looking analysis is performed to reduce the level of speckle noise in slc images and increases the coherence ratio in the interferograms the master images were chosen in such a way to create the maximum number of connections between radar images dehghani et al 2009 milillo et al 2016 karimzadeh et al 2018 goldstein filter was used to reduce the noise that may otherwise make it difficult to unwrap individual phases goldstein et al 1993 then due to the restriction of the interferometric phases produced between π and π phase unwrapping was applied to calculate the absolute value of the phase with respect to a reference point within the interferogram it should be noticed that the insar is able to measure the deformation along the line of sight los since the subsidence is a phenomenon with a dominant vertical displacement component the horizontal component is usually ignored one might prove this through los deformation decomposition into its components using interferograms with different geometries i e ascending and descending by ignoring the horizontal deformation component the los deformation was projected into the vertical direction using the incidence angle accordingly the results produced from different datasets can be compared together in spite of their different imaging geometries the short term as well as long term behavior of the subsidence were examined using the sbas time series analysis method proposed by dehghani et al 2009 in this method after processing the differential interferograms characterized by small baselines the interferograms are inverted in the least square process to estimate the deformation at each acquisition date the time series analysis was performed for envisat asar and sentinel 1 separately the first acquisition of each dataset i e 2003 12 17 and 2015 05 03 was considered as a reference date in time series analysis moreover all interferograms calculated from envisat asar and sentinel 1 images were calibrated according to a spatial reference point which it is explained later in the results and discussion section in order to mitigate the atmospheric effect which has a de correlated behavior in time a smoothing constraint was incorporated into the least square solution using a smoothing factor dehghani et al 2009 the smoothing factor was optimally determined in order to reduce the atmospheric effect while not damping out the seasonal deformation fluctuations using the sbas time series analysis the subsidence time series and the annual rate corresponding to the envisat asar 26 months and sentinel 1 6 months temporal coverage were extracted it should be mentioned that the two time series were analyzed separately due to the lack of independent information on subsidence rate within the temporal gap between both datasets i e 2006 2014 in order to find out the continuation of subsidence sentinel 1 dataset was used in 2015 there are several limiting factors in the radar interferometry technique the interferograms characterized by large spatial and temporal baselines may be contaminated by de correlation noise therefore 16 envisat asar and 10 sentinel 1 coherent interferograms were pre processed as presented in table 2 2 4 piezometric data in order to investigate gwl variations thirteen wells were considered in this study based on the completeness of their data and distribution on the plain fig 1 the gwls in the aquifers have been recorded every month at the period of 1997 2015 earw using the hierarchy algorithm of the ward model ward and joe 1963 and observed gwl data the wells were divided into three clusters to consider only the centroid well of each cluster as the representative of that cluster in the next stages of the modeling after clustering all wells with the same cluster may be regarded to have almost the same behavior therefore all wells were not investigated and the centroid well of each cluster was further considered to perform the investigation but the same method can be applied for all wells as well see for details shargi et al 2018 fig 3 indicates the allocation of wells in 3 clusters via ward method which places eight wells in the first cluster w4 as the centroid well one well in the second cluster w9 and four wells in the third cluster w11 as the centroid well also two dried wells were considered to investigate land subsidence rate after drying d w1 and d w2 2 5 application of swat the swat model swat 2012 revision 637 is a river basin scale catchment model originally reported by arnold et al 1998 it can be used to study the plausible impacts of lucc and also different methods of land management on river water quality and quantity and agricultural chemical matters in drainage basins milano et al 2013 bucak et al 2017 in swat the drainage basin is further divided into sub basins using the dem afterwards hydrologic response units hrus which are unique combinations of soil type land use and slope are created see fig 2 the total amount of runoff sur q is simulated through the individual sub basins after calculating and routing the runoff independently for each hru in this study monthly sur q was simulated by the soil conservation service curve number scs cn for moisture condition ii approach which is a function of the soil s permeability antecedent soil water condition and land use neitsch et al 2011 and evapotranspiration through the hargreaves method since the orchard and agriculture crops need irrigation in zilbier basin the water for them was supplied from the rivers and shallow aquifer in swat model the hydrological balance is calculated following the general equation of arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r d q su e b w se q g where sw t is the soil water content at time t mm r d is the rain on day i q su is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e b is the evapotranspiration on day i mm w se is the infiltration out of the soil profile on day i mm q g is the amount of return flow on day i mm and sw 0 is the initial soil water content the water balance for the shallow aquifer for the land phase of each sub basin is derived as 2 aq sg i aq sg i 1 w rg s g q g w r w pp s g where aq sg i is the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer on day i mm w rg s g is the amount of recharge entering the shallow aquifer on day i mm q g is the gw flow or base flow into the main channel on day i mm w r is the amount of water moving into the soil zone in response to water deficiencies on day i mm and w pp s g is the amount of water removed from the shallow aquifer by pumping on day i mm the various quantities were calculated by swat model based on table 3 2 5 1 sensitivity analysis and model calibration and validation the sufi 2 approach performed in the swat cup software package was used for primary sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2004 the sensitive parameters were subsequently designed for calibration the simulation of monthly discharge was most sensitive to the following four parameters cn2 scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii soil evaporation compensation factor esco available water capacity of the soil layer mm sol awc and deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp in this study calibration was implemented on a monthly basis the model was calibrated for 1990 1994 5 years after an initial 5 year model warm up period 1985 1989 and subsequently validated for period of 2007 2011 after an initial 5 years warm up for 2002 2006 respectively the model was tested for 1985 1994 based on land use map of 1987 and for 2002 2011 based on land use map of 2007 information about land use and its forecasting has been explained in section 2 5 2 there are two hydrological gauges for the measurement of discharge in the region main outlet and sub outlet see fig 1 the data from these gauges were used for the calibration 1990 to 1994 and validation 2007 to 2011 of the model in swat cup format the efficiency of swat model was evaluated quantitatively using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the correlation coefficient r2 the percent bias pbias and the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr based on the review by moriasi et al 2007 see table 4 table 5 represents the calibration and the validation results the quantitative assessment of model efficiency using nse r2 pbias and rsr showed good or very good efficiency during calibration for both the main and sub outlet gauges hydrological gauges based on fig 1 in relation to the criteria listed in moriasi et al 2007 validation of main outlet data based on pbias was good for the period of 2007 2011 the results indicated that the swat model had some difficulties in simulating the dynamics at small scale for the study area because the results were unsatisfactory for the small sub outlet during the validation period see table 5 this may be due to local rainfall events which were not considered at the 7 rainfall gauges used for the entire basin the sub outlet however represents only 1 8 of the whole basin and as such the basin wide data that were evaluated in the lucc scenarios could still be representative for the wider basin 2 5 2 land use data land use data were derived from landsat data for 1987 2007 and 2015 by object oriented method andaryani et al 2019 land use was classified into 10 classes water alfalfa orchard rain fed agriculture residential forest strong pasture weak pasture irrigated wheat and irrigated agriculture then land use was predicted for 2030 based on the derived land use andaryani et al 2019 table 6 presents the area of land uses and luc distributions for different years of 1987 2007 2015 and 2030 these areas however belong to the whole zilbier river basin according to table 6 the dominant land use classes are weak pasture with a coverage of 72 and strong pasture with a coverage of 12 respectively classes of alfalfa orchard irrigated wheat and irrigated agriculture which are high consumption yield crops especially orchard have severely been developed until 2015 although in the whole area i e zilbier river basin high consumption yield crops do not have very wide coverage in the study region the most area belongs to them in the land use classes the apricot crop made up the higher area of fruit trees and the irrigated agriculture mainly belonged to tomato and sunflower iranian ministry of jahade agriculture moja 2007 table 7 shows water consumption of each type of land use for lu forecasting the land use class changes between 1987 and 2007 were first obtained through the cross tab method in order to predict the land use map of 2015 afterwards the binary dependent layer was prepared for all classes and independent layers of altitude slope aspect soil geology distance from road and distance from river in order to enter the logistic regression model and then the effect of each independent layer was determined on the dependent layer class changes afterwards the result of the logistic regression model prediction was introduced to the cellular automata markov cam model as the transition suitability layer marcovian transition estimator mondal and southworth 2010 was used for land use map of 1987 and 2007 in order to determine the probability of change in the areas of the individual classes and finally the land use map of 2007 was introduced to cam model as a basis for prediction of land use map of 2015 and the size of neighborhood filter was considered as 5 5 pixels the obtained result of the classified land use map was validated through the roc model li et al 2012 according to the acceptability of roc result 75 the above mentioned method was considered to create the land use map of 2007 and 2015 and the map of 2030 was then predicted for more details see andaryani et al 2019 fig 4 2 5 3 lucc scenarios for future the effects of lucc scenarios on gws were assessed by comparing swat outputs of baseline and 5 main scenarios climate scenarios for 2030 were generated by applying the delta change approach andaryani et al 2019 where the climatic trends in air temperature and precipitation from either 1985 2014 low delta change ldc or 2005 2014 high delta change hdc periods were used for computing yearly delta factors the latter period resulting in larger changes see fig 5 it should be mentioned that a significant increase for march pcp in hdc tall spike of fig 5 is due to the severe increasing pcp in this month in the period of 2005 2014 4 6 mm yr andaryani et al 2019 the changes in temperature and precipitation were then applied to the 15 year period of the baseline data 2005 2014 using 2000 2004 as a model primary warm up to assess the individual and potentially synergistic effects of lucc a series of simulation scenarios were schemed where these changes were either run individually i e s1 s3 or combined i e s4 and s5 see table 8 3 results and discussion the time series of mean gwl in the aquifer averaged over all piezometers data and for the centroid piezometers of the clusters have been plotted in fig 6 according to fig 6a the average gwl has declined over 19 years by 5 m in the whole aquifer the centroid piezometer of the first cluster i e w4 fig 3 indicates up to 6 m gwl drop in the period from 1997 to 2015 fig 6b the trend line in the centroid piezometer of the second cluster i e w9 fig 3 is reduced about 29 m fig 6c and in the third one i e w11 fig 3 a 2 m increase is seen fig 5d in the third cluster severe gwl fluctuations are clear but in other clusters the gwl reduction is smooth regarding the type of aquifer wells of cluster 1 are located in the confined semi confined and unconfined aquifers and the second cluster is located in the confined aquifer however the area for most of the wells in the third cluster fig 6d is located on the unconfined aquifer and parts of its wells are fed by nearby mountains see fig 3 which shows the position of wells relative to elevation for this reason there is not significant gwl dropping in wells of cluster 3 but also gwl raising can be seen in the wells of this cluster in the next stages of modeling the third cluster was not considered since the aim of this study was to sketch the relationship between gwl drop and land subsidence whereas the wells of this cluster experience gwl increase two wells of the first cluster w1 is located in semi confined aquifer and w4 is located in a confined aquifer were considered to investigate the relationship between gwl drop and land subsidence because it seems the area of this cluster is vast according to fig 3 and probably there are spatial variations in lithology soil and types of aquifers in this cluster 3 1 land deformation to interpret the temporal variations of land subsidence envisat asar and sentinel 1 satellite data were used and the subsidence rate of the study site was obtained sbas time series analysis of the envisat asar and sentinel 1 was performed separately to estimate the subsidence time series in two different periods i e 2003 2006 and 2015 the result of the average displacement using envisat asar and sentinel 1 shows the existence of both uplift and subsidence phenomena in the plain based on the same spatial reference point fig 7 a and b land uplift can be due to atmospheric effects a faulty recovery phase dehghani et al 2013 or even aquifer recharging dong et al 2013 dai et al 2015 due to natural e g hydrology cycle or artificial e g management changes of the aquifer since there is no aquifer recharging in marand plain except in the region of the third cluster it seems that land uplift in the region of the first and second clusters is due to atmospheric effects or fault recovery phase based on fig 7a 24 cm and a 39 cm negative deformation could be seen during 26 months and 6 months respectively and therefore 3141 ha of the area have been affected by land subsidence in confined semi confined and unconfined aquifers this area was calculated using pixels area which had been affected by land subsidence however the high rate subsidence area is mostly located in the confined aquifer in both time series this can be due to the aquifer compression with water removed from the confined aquifer removing of large volumes of water can result in significant ground subsidence the wells in the marand plain which experiences severe land subsidence rate have completely dried out e g d w1 and d w2 in fig 3 these wells are located in the region of the first cluster which is not renewed by other water sources it is considered that there were 60 piezometric in marand plain which 10 have dried out in the recent decade frwmo 2008 furthermore pumping practices have not been modified and following current policies other wells in clusters 1 and 2 may also be gradually drying out in near future see gwl drop rate in fig 6a and b according to fig 8 signs such as the destruction of wells buildings bending of electricity network pillars separation of walls and breaking of walls indicate deformations in the marand plain these signs can be evidence of the occurrence of subsidence anywhere in the world phien wej et al 1998 phi and strokova 2015 furthermore in the last decade several severe floods have occurred in this area frwmo 2010 severe flood can be a sign of negative vertical deformation in the region usgs 2011 in a way that it is compressed and loses its percolation rate because of the subsidence fig 9 indicates the rate of land subsidence by time series analysis of envisat asar relative to gwl decline and sentinel 1 interferograms in the selected wells positions if the hydraulic conductivity of compressible sediments of the aquitards is low there is a time delay between the water table decline and compaction of the sediments in order to find the time delay the subsidence time series were compared to the gwl time series by the correlation coefficient considering zero one and two months lag times the value of the correlation coefficient is 0 76 0 51 0 53 for w1 in zero one and two lag times respectively 0 79 0 56 0 37 for w4 in zero one and two lag times respectively and 0 63 0 40 0 44 for w9 in zero one and two lag times respectively the result shows that the lag between these time series is less than one month a linear relationship between the land deformation and gwl was derived for w1 fig 9b w4 fig 9c and w9 fig 9d but for wells d w1 and d w2 such relation could not be extracted as these wells have been dried out during 2003 2006 fig 9a the results indicate a strong and positive correlation between the land subsidence and the gwl drop with average correlation coefficient of 0 73 that this result is consistent with the conclusions of jeanne et al 2018 who indicated that land subsidence occurred in areas where the density of groundwater wells is the highest fig 9e shows land deformation extracted from sentinel 1 since the period of sentinel 1 datasets are in gwl depletion time may october the rate of subsidence is higher than that extracted from envisat asar the rate of subsidence in 2015 was not used in the modeling however the result was used to find out the continuation of subsidence in the study area severe land subsidence could be seen in the region where wells are drying out this sign suggests that when water is extracted and removed from the fine grained and highly compressible sediments such as clay and silt aquifer inter beds are compressed and the land subsidence occurs hoffmann et al 2003 dehghani et al 2009 in fig 9b e the differences in the regression coefficients a in y ax b obtained for different parts of the region can be due to the differences in lithology profiles and soil type which are the most effective factors for the soil resistance therefore the extensive withdrawal of gw may not be the sole reason of the land subsidence and hydrogeology may also control the rate of this phenomenon thus although the gwl has significantly dropped in w4 and w9 about 3 m and 6 m respectively in 26 months land subsidence has mostly occurred in the region around well w4 in other words the rate of subsidence is 6 cm yr and 7 cm yr in the region around wells w4 and w9 respectively although the gwl reduction has been almost doubled in w9 with regard to w4 this result is consistent with the conclusions of dehghani et al 2013 for other plains of iran but it differs from the results of solaimani and mortazavi 2008 who emphasized that land subsidence happens due to considerable withdrawal of gwl therefore for the region of the w1 w4 and w9 wells respectively about 8 cm 4 cm and 2 6 cm vertical displacements could be observed for one meter of gwl drop this result differs with the results obtained by solaimani and mortazavi 2008 which reported 5 15 cm land subsidence rate for each meter drop of gwl for rafsanjan plain due to the spatial variations in lithology soil and types of aquifers 3 2 comparing the gwl and gws variations after sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of swat gws of the plain area was simulated to compare long term simulated gws and observed gwl variations fig 10 compares the trend between gwl observation and gws modeling for the piezometers of the first and second clusters w1 w4 and w9 since in the present study gw reserve parameters were not calibrated in swat due to the lack of ability of swat in simulating gw thus by comparing the piezometric level of wells and the amount of gws in the corresponding hru of that well their temporal variations in terms of increasing or decreasing trend could be verified swat simulates gws rather than gwl we do not attempt to make a direct mathematical relationship between gwl and gws but we know there is a strong direct conceptual relationship between them fig 10 shows that the variation in simulated gws and observed gwl are highly consistent hence supporting that the simulated signals of gws in our scenarios are also representative of the likely changes in gwl in these scenarios since the decline rate of both gws and gwl is similar the gwl decline rate was replaced with gws decline rate obtained by swat to compute gw decline rate to make a regression based equation with deformation fig 9 it seems that calibration of gw parameters was needed in order to decrease uncertainty and harmonize the behavior between two variables observed and simulated 3 3 impacts of lucc scenarios on gws and consequently on land subsidence the monthly gws of the plain were simulated by swat for 5 different scenarios table 9 shows the percentages decrease of gws in the different scenarios s1 s5 with regard to the baseline scenario sb for scenario s1 which considers no change in temperature and precipitation but a land use change up to 2030 the amount of gws will be reduced about 31 67 and 79 in wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively considering cc based on the ldc and no change in land use s2 this will reduce gws up to 23 44 and 63 for wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively via scenario s3 which considers both precipitation and temperature changes cc variations based on the hdc but no change of land use i e land use of 2007 about 71 81 and 93 reduction in gws will occur in wells w1 w4 and w9 respectively by combining land use and cc in 2030 at scenario 4 the ldc factor a decline of 52 94 and 99 of gws is predicted in wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively finally for scenario s5 which considers both lucc based on the hdc a decline of 82 99 and 100 in gws is expected for wells of w1 w4 and w9 respectively the well w9 may be dried out by 2025 there is no gws in the hru for the period of 2025 2030 however other wells also do not seem to be in a satisfactory situation under the scenario s5 the severe reduction in gws caused by extra withdrawal for irrigation can obviously impact the local gwl in other words all scenarios indicated very strong effects of lucc on gws the effect which may be evident within the next two decades especially in s4 and s5 scenarios in this study water use for irrigation causes a drop in gws due to an increase in the orchard land use and irrigated agriculture which are high consumption yield crops moja 2007 fig 11 shows the increase of area related to the orchard irrigated agriculture alfalfa and residential land uses however the decline in area of irrigated wheat is clear in 2030 which is low consumption yield crop see table 7 for this reason scenario s1 has a more severe impact on the drop of gws relative to scenario s2 comparing the results of scenarios s1 and s3 by 2030 shows that with regard to the luc cc has prominent effect on the rate decrease of gws in the cc future scenarios there has been no change in gw harvesting in other words when temperature is increasing which is shown in fig 5 it is expected that water used for animals plants and humans is also increased and in the case of a decrease in surface water resources significantly reduced in this area gw will experience a strong pressure it should be noted that water consumption for households and municipal use was not considered due to their low consumption levels 10 relative to the agricultural consumption 90 moja 2007 cc can decrease aquifer recharge rate and increase gw demand for irrigation supply in arid and semi arid areas e g marand plain by any change in precipitation evapotranspiration snow accumulation and snow melt charles 2016 in the study area there is a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature soltani et al 2016 consequently increasing in evapotranspiration has made a high demand for irrigation and aquifer recharge reduction for these reasons wells for irrigation in the marand plain have increased up to 30 spatially in the last decade frwmo 2008 and gw supply in the plain is severely decreasing until 2030 by lucc in the swat modeling the water resources used for irrigation in the scenarios and baseline were kept constant and taken from either rivers or gw sources i e shallow aquifer hence for the regions with no water available in rivers or shallow wells the crop yield will decline in the modeling therefore managing the crop yield based on crop performance and change of water resource type from well to river and vice versa can improve the results of calibration nevertheless due to the strong relationship between gw decline and land subsidence if land use and climate changes continue based on considered scenarios in the present study the average negative displacement in the study area will be increased based on table 10 the amount of land subsidence is represented in table 10 for different scenarios up to 2030 the impact of luc on the land subsidence rate is greater than cc based on the ldc scenarios s1 vs s2 however this issue is reversed when cc is based on hdc factors scenarios s1 vs s3 in investigated wells according to scenarios s4 and s5 which consider both luc and cc lucc variations based on the ldc and hdc about 1 13 m land subsidence will occur in the wells although the land subsidence in scenarios s4 and s5 is similar in w9 hru see table 10 due to elongation of land subsidence in regions around dried wells land subsidence around this hru in scenario s5 may be more severe than scenario s4 for two study periods 2003 12 2015 10 and 2015 05 2015 10 about 3141 ha have been affected by land subsidence which will certainly increase in the future based on the proposed methodology in the present study it can be noted that artificial recharge and management of the gw withdrawal may reduce gwl damages artificial recharge can be used to control and store water underground in periods of water surplus to use in periods of shortage it can also control land subsidence caused by declining gwl maintain base flow in some streams and raise water levels to reduce the cost of ground water pumping in general assessing the results of the scenarios indicate that there is no linear relationship between the gws variations and land subsidence rate it seems that other hydrogeological factors i e lithology and soil may also affect the land subsidence rate 4 conclusions in the present study insar sbas time series analysis and the swat model were used to explore the effects of lucc on gwl decrease and to examine the effect of this decline on the land subsidence of the marand plain which is a strategic area in iran employing the sbas method and analyzing the images of envisat asar and sentinel 1 during a 2 periods i e 2003 12 2006 03 and 2015 5 2015 10 it was found that 3141 ha of the marand plain have undergone some degrees of land subsidence fig 7 such subsidence damaged building structures including structures around wells walls of settlements and concrete around canals and power rails the maximum subsidence rate of the study area ranges 24 cm and 39 cm over the 26 months and 6 months respectively because of the direct relationship between gwl decline and subsidence rate fig 10b d gws obtained by the swat model was used to determine the lucc effects at different scenarios on gws and consequently on the subsidence of the plain area changes in lu and cc were considered based on the trends in recent historical observations it was found that the effect of cc is more severe compared to that of luc considering both changes in the future 81 7 and 93 6 percent of the gws in the region under the ldc and hdc conditions will be decreased respectively because of the direct relationship between gwl decline and land subsidence the area that will be affected by land subsidence will increase and the vertical movement of the ground surface will result in an average of 5 cm increase in subsidence for each meter of gw decline the results of this study illustrate that the prepared framework can be used to efficiently monitor the lucc effect on water and soil resources update land subsidence tables and monitor land subsidence behavior the results of this research will be helpful for risk analyzers and environmental management of the study site future work may also address the integration of this framework with groundwater models e g modflow linked to swat for simulating more spatially explicit gwl in order to conceive the spatial uncertainty of results finally preventing further gws losses and the hydrologic consequences associated with such losses should be a critical preference for state water managers and artificial

6144,soil water characteristic curve swcc is a critical parameter for unsaturated soil however few study can be found in literature for swcc of loess with high soluble salt content in particular swcc fitting model this paper targets on ili loess in xinjiang in china which has a high level of soluble salts and is a typical loess in central asia centrifuge method and filter paper method are used to conduct swcc tests of ili loess under different salt conditions the total and matric suction of ili loess under different soluble salt contents are obtained the results of two methods are compared the corresponding influence of soluble salt on swcc is studied at the same time based on the gardner model a new swcc fitting model of total and matric suction for ili loess is proposed which is able to consider the influences of soluble salts the test results show that the compression during centrifuge method contributes certain increase of matric suction especially at high volumetric water content conditions soluble salts have large effect on total and osmotic suction of ili loess however limited effect on matric suction the alteration of total and osmotic suction is caused by the change of solution concentration in the sample total suction is mainly affected by osmotic suction the alteration of matric suction is caused by the precipitation of the salts it is proved that the proposed

important state variable in the study of unsaturated soil mechanics bordoni et al 2017 and the soil water characteristic curve swcc which characterizes the relationship between suction and water content is indispensable fattah et al 2013a b 2017 2018 tan et al 2016 as a typical unsaturated soil a large number of experimental studies on the swcc of unsaturated loess can be found in literature zhao et al 2010 muñoz castelblanco et al 2012 gu et al 2016 hou et al 2016 there are also many fitting models have been proposed by summarizing the experimental results or based on existing fitting models for example liu et al 2011 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded loess under different initial dry densities and proved that the gardner model fits well for shaanxi loess yuan et al 2012 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded and undisturbed loess in the surrounding area of lanzhou and found that the williams model fits well chen et al 2011 studied the swcc of xi an undisturbed loess under the confined compression condition and suggested that the swcc under different stress conditions could be described by power function lu and cheng 2007 measured the matric swcc of remolded loess in xi an and proposed an empirical formula which considers temperature density and water content conditions guo et al 2016 used five different fitting models in datebase software to fit the matric suction swcc of undisturbed loess in qishan baoji and yangling and suggested a simplified fitting model for engineering applications zhang et al 2013 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded loess and improved van genuchten model by introducing the ratio of water and soil volume as for studies on swcc of loess with different soluble salt contents few paper can be occasionally found in literature such as wang et al 2009 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded saline soil by adding nacl to luoyang loess besides the aforementioned experimental loess samples are mainly from loess plateau of china which normally has low level of salt content 1 3 g kg 1 cui et al 2016 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2017 thus few researchers considered the effect of high soluble salt content for the study of swcc of unsaturated loess and the corresponding fitting model the ili valley in xinjiang locates in northwest of china border with almaty of kazakhstan and is the only region in china that affected by atlantic ocean climate thus a large scale of aeolian loess ili loess is distributed during a long period of dry and cold weather condition zhang et al 2016a different from the loess in loess plateau ili loess has a very high level of soluble salts which is typical in central asia maximum soluble salt content 19 2 g kg 1 zhang et al 2016b the high level of soluble salt content potentially has a great influence on soil suction especially the total suction therefore the in depth experimental researches on swcc of ili loess and its fitting model need to be conducted this paper targets on the ili loess with high level of soluble salts measures the total and matric suction swcc of undisturbed ili loess by centrifuge method cm and filter paper method fpm proposes a new swcc fitting model for ili loess by considering the influence of soluble salt content and analyses the corresponding influence mechanism the research results will promote the development of loess mechanics and boost the initiative of infrastructure constructions in central asian countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 basic properties of soil samples the soil samples are taken from the depth of 21 5 22 m in zhaosu basin ili xinjiang china the initial water content of the soil sample is 6 67 and the dry density is 1 37 g cm 3 according to specification of soil test sl237 1999 ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1999 the contents of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 were measured by titration method and the contents of k and na were measured by a flame photometer the initial soluble salt contents of the soil sample are shown in table 1 in view of the fact that the maximum soluble salt content of ili loess in the same area is 19 2 g kg 1 zhang et al 2016b so the contents of soluble salt in the test soil samples are 5 g kg 1 8 g kg 1 14 g kg 1 20 g kg 1 26 g kg 1 2 2 preparation of undisturbed samples with different soluble salt contents twenty undisturbed samples were used for all the lab tests half of which are used for cm and the others for fpm in order to obtain undisturbed samples under different soluble salt contents salt solutions were added to the upper and lower sample surfaces using water film transfer method gu et al 2016 repeat adding process several times to reach the specified compositions the added solution was strictly controlled i e less than 10 ml and the natural drying time was more than 24 h after each adding to prevent sample expansion finally in order to ensure uniform distribution of salts the prepared samples were wrapped with preservative film and placed in a moisturizing cylinder for more than 3 days during the test a certain number of soil samples were taken for retests of salt content water content and density 2 3 experiment methods 2 3 1 centrifuge method cm the high speed centrifuge method is a test method for quickly measuring the swcc the main principle is to equalize the centrifugal force and the suction in the soil the cr21g second generation high speed thermostat centrifuge made by hitachi was used in this test the centrifuge speeds centrifugal forces and measured suctions are shown in table 2 specific test steps are as follows ① wrap the sample in a semi permeable membrane then place it in a tray filled with pure water make the water level lower than membrane soak for more than 8 h to reach saturation ② put the sample into the centrifuge machine set the corresponding speed and time according to table 2 ③ after each stage of centrifugation dry the water on the outer wall then weigh and calculate the water content of the sample ④ after the last stage take the sample out and place it in an oven at 105 c check the water content of sample and finally obtain swcc 2 3 2 filter paper method fpm as a porous medium filter paper can also generate water suction in the same way as unsaturated soil when the suction of the filter paper and the soil sample are balanced the suction of the soil sample can be indirectly estimated by the water content of the filter paper when the filter paper is in contact with the sample the suction to the solution in the sample are balanced then the matric suction of the sample can be measured when the filter paper is not in contact with the sample the suction to the water vapor around the sample are balanced then the total suction of the sample can be measured the schematic diagram of the filter paper test instrument is shown in fig 1 the specific test steps are as follows leong et al 2002 american society for testing and materials 2010 ① the water content of the sample is set to be 7 using pure water then wrapped it in preservative film and put it into the curing cylinder for more than 3 days ② one day before testing put the filter paper in an oven at 105 c until constant weight after the filter paper was cool down put the sample and the filter papers into a sealed container as shown in fig 1 wrap with preservative film and place the sealed container in the thermostat cabinet 20 2 c for more than 7 days to achieve water balance between the soil sample and the filter papers ③ open the sealed container and quickly weigh the mass of the sample and the filter papers the mass precision of the filter paper is 0 0001 g ④ put the wet filter paper into the oven at 105 c for more than 8 h after cool down weigh the dry filter paper accurate to 0 0001 g then calculate the water content of the filter papers and determine the corresponding suction value by the calibration curve equations i e eqs 1 4 leong et al 2002 ⑤ the water content of the samples are 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 then repeat ② ④ steps to obtain the swcc of matric suction and total suction matric suction calibration curve equations are 1 lg s m 2 909 0 0229 w f w f 47 2 lg s m 4 945 0 0673 w f w f 47 total suction calibration curve equations are 3 lg s t 8 778 0 222 w f w f 26 4 lg s t 5 31 0 0879 w f w f 26 where sm is the matric suction kpa st is the total suction kpa wf is the filter paper water content 3 test results and discussion 3 1 test results of cm due to the high content of soluble salt in the sample the dissolution and precipitation of the soluble salt have a great influence on the mass and water content of the test samples therefore the volumetric water content is used to characterize the liquid content in the samples the matric suction swcc with different soluble salt content obtained by the cm is shown in fig 2 basically a consistent decreasing trend is obtained for each condition of the soluble salt content the highest changing rate happens around the matric suction of 10 kpa which roughly corresponds to the air entry value sample matric suction increases as the increase of soluble salt content 3 2 test results of fpm the matric suction is caused by the pressure difference between two sides of contracted film structure i e the interface of liquid phase and gas phase in soil which is mainly affected by the soil structure and water content the osmotic suction so is caused by soil solution and mainly affected by the solution concentration the total suction is the sum of matric suction and osmotic suction the swccs of matric suction total suction and osmotic suction with different soluble salt contents obtained by fpm are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the change of the soluble salt content has a limited influence on matric suction the matric suction increases slightly with the increase of soluble salt content especially at low volumetric water content and high suction condition however the total and osmotic suctions increase significantly with the increase of soluble salt content matric suction only affects total suction at low volumetric water content around 8 meanwhile the increase of total suction is mainly caused by osmotic suction at high volumetric water content 13 38 when the volumetric water content decreases and the solution tends to be saturated the osmotic suction has an extreme value which generally not exceed 25 000 kpa similar results can be found in literature sun et al 2013 3 3 the effect of solution concentration and precipitation on suction the effect of soluble salts on swcc is mainly caused by the dissolution and precipitation of soluble salts in soil the pores of samples are filled with the precipitated salt particles which makes the reduction of pore volume and the increase of matric suction however the other soluble salts dissolve in the solution of the samples which causes the solution concentration and the increase of osmotic suction and total suction 3 3 1 calculation of solution concentration and precipitation when the temperature is constant the dissolution and precipitation of the soluble salts can be determined by the difference between the ion product qi and the solubility product ksp of the solution the ion product is the concentration production of each ion in the solution meng et al 1988 and the solubility product of different solutions can be obtained through the method provided in literature speight 2015 shown in table 3 when qi ksp the solution reaches a precipitation dissolution equilibrium state and is saturated when qi ksp the solute is precipitated when qi ksp the solution is unsaturated when the residual concentration of ion is less than 10 5 mol l 1 the ion is completely precipitated meng et al 1988 according to the measured molar concentrations of each ion the added four salt solutions are mgso4 cacl nahco3 naoh and the corresponding ratio is 0 22 0 05 0 03 1 once added the salts will interact and generate less soluble compounds i e mg oh 2 caso4 ca oh 2 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 due to the solubility principle the sequence of precipitation is mg oh 2 caso4 ca oh 2 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 based on the rule of solubility product to calculate the difference between ion product qi and solubility product ksp the mass of the precipitated solute and the solution concentration at different volumetric water contents will then be obtained the specific calculation process is ① considering the solubility of the less soluble compounds here take mg oh 2 as an example firstly calculate the ion product of mg oh 2 and compare with the standard solubility product then determine the precipitation possibility of mg oh 2 when there is no precipitation the salts are completely dissolved when there is precipitation the precipitated value of mg oh 2 will be obtained by the next step ② according to the precipitation dissolution equilibrium formula qi ksp and the minimum ion residual concentration value of 10 5mol l 1 the minimum concentration of oh to precipitate all the remaining mg2 is 1 34 10 3 mol l 1 thus when the actual concentration of oh is larger the mg2 is regarded as completely precipitated and the corresponding mass of mg oh 2 is calculated when they are smaller the residual concentrations of mg2 and oh are calculated by qi ksp ③ according to the solubility rule caso4 ca oh 2 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 repeat step ① ② to calculate the precipitated mass of each compound until there is no precipitation thus the total mass of the precipitated salt msalt will be calculated and the solution concentration is calculated by the following equation 5 k 0 001 α m s m salt m s w 0 001 α m salt 100 where k is the solution concentration msalt is the mass of precipitated salt g table 4 summaries the aforementioned calculation results of solution concentration and precipitation mass for the samples with different soluble salt contents and volumetric water contents 3 3 2 the effect of precipitation on matric suction from table 4 one can conclude that the precipitated salt increases as the increase of soluble salt content and limited precipitated salts dissolve again due to the increase of volumetric water content for fpm at low volumetric water content and high suction conditions the size of pores in the sample is decreased and thus the matric suction is obviously increased due to the filling of the precipitated salts into the original pores in contrary at high volumetric water content and low suction conditions the small pores are almost filled with water and the rest large pores that filled with precipitated salts have limited influences on matric suction however for all the conditions of cm the results show that matric suction increases as the increase of soluble salt content which is different from partial stages of fpm the possible reason is the compression deformation caused by centrifugal force especially at high volumetric water content the size of pores in the sample is decreased due to compression and thus increases the matric suction this magnification effect of soluble salt content on matric suction swcc should be corrected 3 3 3 the effect of solution concentration on total and osmotic suction fig 4 illustrates the variation of solution concentration for different soluble salt contents and volumetric water contents it can be concluded that solution concentration increases significantly with the increase of soluble salt content but gradually decreases and tends to be consistent with the increase of volumetric water content fig 5 shows the relationship between total suction osmotic suction and solution concentration proportional relation can be found for both total suction and osmotic suction the trend of total suction with solution concentration is similar with the trend of osmotic suction and the increase in total suction of the sample is mainly caused by the increase of osmotic suction 4 swcc fitting model 4 1 swcc fitting since 1922 gardner first proposed the swcc fitting model which considers the air entry value and the residual water content the improvement and modification of swcc fitting model has always been a research topic nowadays the most commonly used fitting models are fredlund xing model gardner model and van genuchten model the corresponding equations are ① fredlund xing model 1994 fredlund and xing 1994 6 θ θ s ln e s a n m θ r where θs is the saturated volumetric water content θr is the residual volumetric water content a n and m are the fitting parameters a is the suction value at the inflection point of the curve and slightly larger than air entry value n is a parameter related to the slope of a curve at an inflection point m is the fitting parameter related to the residual volumetric water content xie 2015 ② gardner model 1958 gardner 1958 7 θ θ s θ r s a n 1 θ r where a and n are fitting parameters ③ van genuchten model 1980 van genuchten 1980 8 θ θ s θ r s a n 1 m θ r where a n and m are fitting parameters and m 1 1 n the saturated volumetric water content in eqs 6 8 is normally the physical property of the soil sample but in this paper the soluble salt precipitation need to be considered during the test mg2 can be completely precipitated due to the large content of oh at the same time with the increase of volumetric water content ca2 cannot be completely precipitated however with the residual concentration being less than 0 0003 mol l the remaining ca2 is neglected therefore a basic assumption for the calculation of saturated volumetric water content is that mg2 and ca2 are completely precipitated in the form of mg oh 2 and caso4 and there is no other precipitation thus the mass of precipitation of the saturated sample at a total volume of 100 cm3 is calculated by the molar concentration of mg2 and ca2 as shown in eq 9 9 m salt γ m s 1000 r m g 2 m mg oh 2 r c a 2 m cas o 4 where m salt is the mass of precipitation of the saturated sample at a total volume of 100 cm3 g γ is the content of soluble salt g kg 1 ms is the dry weight of the soil g r m g 2 is the molar concentration of mg2 0 00298 mol g r c a 2 is the molar concentration of ca2 0 000673 mol g m mg oh 2 is the molar mass of mg oh 2 58 g mol m cas o 4 is the molar mass of caso4 136 g mol ws and ms can be calculated by solving two simultaneous eqs 10 and 11 the saturated volumetric water content under different soluble salt contents can then be calculated by eq 12 the corresponding results are shown in table 5 10 s r w g s ρ d g s ρ w ρ d 0 001 α m s m salt m s w s m s m salt g s ρ d g s 0 001 γ m s m salt m s w s m s w s ρ d 1 11 ρ d m s m salt v 12 θ s w s m s where sr is the degree of saturation which is 1 for saturated sample gs is the specific gravity of sample 2 72 w is the liquid content the ratio of solution mass to salt and soil mass ministry of railways first survey and design institute 1998 ρw is the density of the solution g cm3 ρd is the dry density g cm3 ws is the saturated water content v is the volume v 100 cm3 4 1 1 matric suction swcc fitting by using saturated volume water content and the eqs 6 8 the matric suction swccs obtained from the tests are fitted by the lsqnonlin function in matlab the results are shown in tables 6 11 it can be seen from tables 6 to 11 that the matric suction swccs of ili loess under different soluble salt contents are fitted well by these three fitting models and all the r2 are above 0 99 however the fitting parameter θr in fredlund xing model approaches to zero which is inconsistent with its actual physical meaning the regularity of the fitting parameter θr in van genuchten model is not clear especially for matric suction swccs from fpm and partial fitting result are too small to be consistent with the actual situation therefore the gardner model is the most suitable fitting model with r2 over 0 97 and is used for swcc fitting of ili loess in this research the matric suction fitting results by gardner model fitting are shown in fig 6 4 1 2 total suction swcc fitting the fpm has certain limitation for the test range in measuring total suction at low total suction stage the water content of filter paper after balancing is too large which can easily be significantly influenced by the environment such as temperature thus the value cannot be accurately measured and finally affects the accuracy of matric suction the test results are reliable only when the total suction range is 103 5 105 kpa lu and likos 2012 therefore at high volume water content and low suction conditions the test result from fpm is incomplete which generates difficulties for the commonly used fitting models the residual volumetric water content reflects the boundary of the pore water in the soil from the combined water and capillary water to the gravity water when the volumetric water content is lower than the residual volumetric water content the water in the soil is dominated by the combined water and capillary water xie 2015 which makes the matric suction increase significantly as the combined water cannot dissolve salts ministry of railways first survey and design institute 1998 and there is very few capillary water content the osmotic suction is negligible so the total suction basically has the same value as matric suction xie 2015 meanwhile the total suction swcc and matric suction swcc should have similar residual volumetric water content by using saturated and residual volume water content obtained from matric suction fitting and gardner model good fitting results are obtained for total suction swcc as shown in fig 7 and table 12 excellent fitting results are obtained in comparison with the experiments especially at low total suction conditions the small difference at high total suction conditions mainly refers to the residual volume water content parts thus it can be concluded that gardner model best fits the swcc of ili loess in xinjiang with different soluble salt contents 4 2 fitting model 4 2 1 matric suction swcc fitting model based on the analysis of the fitting parameters of the matric suction swcc fig 8 shows the relationship between the fitting parameters a n θr of gardner model and the soluble salt content γ obtained by cm and fpm although there are some differences in the value and the variation tendency of the parameters which mainly occurs on a a linear relationship between a and γ is obtained the difference of a is mainly caused by the different experiment principle of the two methods in addition the compression deformation from cm contributes certain increase of matric suction especially at high volumetric water content conditions the matric suction swcc fitting model of ili loess considering soluble salt content is obtained by normalization which uses a and γ with gardner model and averages other parameters eq 13 eq 13 is able to reveal the characteristic of matric suction of ili loess under the coupling effect of soluble salt content and volumetric water content the fitting results are shown in fig 9 13 θ θ s θ r s m c γ d n 1 θ r where n 1 137 θs 49 36 θr 11 97 c 0 176 d 15 725 cm n 0 704 θs 50 91 θr 8 44 c 0 391 d 29 343 fpm 4 2 2 total suction swcc fitting model in a similar way the total suction swcc fitting parameters of gardner model indicate that the parameter a varies greatly with soluble salt content γ see fig 10 the total suction swcc fitting model of ili loess considering the coupling influences of soluble salt content and volumetric water content is shown in eq 14 14 θ θ s θ r s t p e qy n 1 θ r where n 1 603 p 235 839 q 0 131 fig 11 illustrates the fitting result of eq 14 and the experimental data a good fitting is obtained besides eq 14 is applicable of calculating the total suction swcc of ili loess under different soluble salt contents by comparing fig 9 with fig 11 the conclusion is made that total suction is easily affected by the soluble salt content 4 3 model validation for validation purpose eq 13 is used to fit the matric suction swcc of different nacl content used in literature fattah et al 2013b a good fitting result is obtained r2 0 94 which is shown in fig 12 due to the lack of test data in literature the fitting of eq 14 is not conducted however the total suction swcc of different nacl content used in literature of fattah et al 2013 is fitted by gardner model see fig 13 and a good fitting result is obtained fig 14 shows the exponential relationship between fitting parameter a and nacl content γ 5 conclusions this paper investigated the swcc of ili loess with different high level of soluble salts and the corresponding fitting model using centrifuge method and filter paper method from the experimental investigations the conclusions are 1 the soluble salt content has a limited influence on matric suction but a great influence on total and osmotic suction 2 the total and osmotic suctions increase significantly with the increase of soluble salt content besides the influences of soluble salts on suctions are also studied by calculating the precipitation and dissolution of soluble salts and the conclusion is that the large influences of soluble salts on total and osmotic suction of ili loess mainly come from the change of solution concentration based on the gardner

6144,soil water characteristic curve swcc is a critical parameter for unsaturated soil however few study can be found in literature for swcc of loess with high soluble salt content in particular swcc fitting model this paper targets on ili loess in xinjiang in china which has a high level of soluble salts and is a typical loess in central asia centrifuge method and filter paper method are used to conduct swcc tests of ili loess under different salt conditions the total and matric suction of ili loess under different soluble salt contents are obtained the results of two methods are compared the corresponding influence of soluble salt on swcc is studied at the same time based on the gardner model a new swcc fitting model of total and matric suction for ili loess is proposed which is able to consider the influences of soluble salts the test results show that the compression during centrifuge method contributes certain increase of matric suction especially at high volumetric water content conditions soluble salts have large effect on total and osmotic suction of ili loess however limited effect on matric suction the alteration of total and osmotic suction is caused by the change of solution concentration in the sample total suction is mainly affected by osmotic suction the alteration of matric suction is caused by the precipitation of the salts it is proved that the proposed

important state variable in the study of unsaturated soil mechanics bordoni et al 2017 and the soil water characteristic curve swcc which characterizes the relationship between suction and water content is indispensable fattah et al 2013a b 2017 2018 tan et al 2016 as a typical unsaturated soil a large number of experimental studies on the swcc of unsaturated loess can be found in literature zhao et al 2010 muñoz castelblanco et al 2012 gu et al 2016 hou et al 2016 there are also many fitting models have been proposed by summarizing the experimental results or based on existing fitting models for example liu et al 2011 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded loess under different initial dry densities and proved that the gardner model fits well for shaanxi loess yuan et al 2012 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded and undisturbed loess in the surrounding area of lanzhou and found that the williams model fits well chen et al 2011 studied the swcc of xi an undisturbed loess under the confined compression condition and suggested that the swcc under different stress conditions could be described by power function lu and cheng 2007 measured the matric swcc of remolded loess in xi an and proposed an empirical formula which considers temperature density and water content conditions guo et al 2016 used five different fitting models in datebase software to fit the matric suction swcc of undisturbed loess in qishan baoji and yangling and suggested a simplified fitting model for engineering applications zhang et al 2013 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded loess and improved van genuchten model by introducing the ratio of water and soil volume as for studies on swcc of loess with different soluble salt contents few paper can be occasionally found in literature such as wang et al 2009 measured the matric suction swcc of remolded saline soil by adding nacl to luoyang loess besides the aforementioned experimental loess samples are mainly from loess plateau of china which normally has low level of salt content 1 3 g kg 1 cui et al 2016 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2017 thus few researchers considered the effect of high soluble salt content for the study of swcc of unsaturated loess and the corresponding fitting model the ili valley in xinjiang locates in northwest of china border with almaty of kazakhstan and is the only region in china that affected by atlantic ocean climate thus a large scale of aeolian loess ili loess is distributed during a long period of dry and cold weather condition zhang et al 2016a different from the loess in loess plateau ili loess has a very high level of soluble salts which is typical in central asia maximum soluble salt content 19 2 g kg 1 zhang et al 2016b the high level of soluble salt content potentially has a great influence on soil suction especially the total suction therefore the in depth experimental researches on swcc of ili loess and its fitting model need to be conducted this paper targets on the ili loess with high level of soluble salts measures the total and matric suction swcc of undisturbed ili loess by centrifuge method cm and filter paper method fpm proposes a new swcc fitting model for ili loess by considering the influence of soluble salt content and analyses the corresponding influence mechanism the research results will promote the development of loess mechanics and boost the initiative of infrastructure constructions in central asian countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 basic properties of soil samples the soil samples are taken from the depth of 21 5 22 m in zhaosu basin ili xinjiang china the initial water content of the soil sample is 6 67 and the dry density is 1 37 g cm 3 according to specification of soil test sl237 1999 ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1999 the contents of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 were measured by titration method and the contents of k and na were measured by a flame photometer the initial soluble salt contents of the soil sample are shown in table 1 in view of the fact that the maximum soluble salt content of ili loess in the same area is 19 2 g kg 1 zhang et al 2016b so the contents of soluble salt in the test soil samples are 5 g kg 1 8 g kg 1 14 g kg 1 20 g kg 1 26 g kg 1 2 2 preparation of undisturbed samples with different soluble salt contents twenty undisturbed samples were used for all the lab tests half of which are used for cm and the others for fpm in order to obtain undisturbed samples under different soluble salt contents salt solutions were added to the upper and lower sample surfaces using water film transfer method gu et al 2016 repeat adding process several times to reach the specified compositions the added solution was strictly controlled i e less than 10 ml and the natural drying time was more than 24 h after each adding to prevent sample expansion finally in order to ensure uniform distribution of salts the prepared samples were wrapped with preservative film and placed in a moisturizing cylinder for more than 3 days during the test a certain number of soil samples were taken for retests of salt content water content and density 2 3 experiment methods 2 3 1 centrifuge method cm the high speed centrifuge method is a test method for quickly measuring the swcc the main principle is to equalize the centrifugal force and the suction in the soil the cr21g second generation high speed thermostat centrifuge made by hitachi was used in this test the centrifuge speeds centrifugal forces and measured suctions are shown in table 2 specific test steps are as follows ① wrap the sample in a semi permeable membrane then place it in a tray filled with pure water make the water level lower than membrane soak for more than 8 h to reach saturation ② put the sample into the centrifuge machine set the corresponding speed and time according to table 2 ③ after each stage of centrifugation dry the water on the outer wall then weigh and calculate the water content of the sample ④ after the last stage take the sample out and place it in an oven at 105 c check the water content of sample and finally obtain swcc 2 3 2 filter paper method fpm as a porous medium filter paper can also generate water suction in the same way as unsaturated soil when the suction of the filter paper and the soil sample are balanced the suction of the soil sample can be indirectly estimated by the water content of the filter paper when the filter paper is in contact with the sample the suction to the solution in the sample are balanced then the matric suction of the sample can be measured when the filter paper is not in contact with the sample the suction to the water vapor around the sample are balanced then the total suction of the sample can be measured the schematic diagram of the filter paper test instrument is shown in fig 1 the specific test steps are as follows leong et al 2002 american society for testing and materials 2010 ① the water content of the sample is set to be 7 using pure water then wrapped it in preservative film and put it into the curing cylinder for more than 3 days ② one day before testing put the filter paper in an oven at 105 c until constant weight after the filter paper was cool down put the sample and the filter papers into a sealed container as shown in fig 1 wrap with preservative film and place the sealed container in the thermostat cabinet 20 2 c for more than 7 days to achieve water balance between the soil sample and the filter papers ③ open the sealed container and quickly weigh the mass of the sample and the filter papers the mass precision of the filter paper is 0 0001 g ④ put the wet filter paper into the oven at 105 c for more than 8 h after cool down weigh the dry filter paper accurate to 0 0001 g then calculate the water content of the filter papers and determine the corresponding suction value by the calibration curve equations i e eqs 1 4 leong et al 2002 ⑤ the water content of the samples are 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 then repeat ② ④ steps to obtain the swcc of matric suction and total suction matric suction calibration curve equations are 1 lg s m 2 909 0 0229 w f w f 47 2 lg s m 4 945 0 0673 w f w f 47 total suction calibration curve equations are 3 lg s t 8 778 0 222 w f w f 26 4 lg s t 5 31 0 0879 w f w f 26 where sm is the matric suction kpa st is the total suction kpa wf is the filter paper water content 3 test results and discussion 3 1 test results of cm due to the high content of soluble salt in the sample the dissolution and precipitation of the soluble salt have a great influence on the mass and water content of the test samples therefore the volumetric water content is used to characterize the liquid content in the samples the matric suction swcc with different soluble salt content obtained by the cm is shown in fig 2 basically a consistent decreasing trend is obtained for each condition of the soluble salt content the highest changing rate happens around the matric suction of 10 kpa which roughly corresponds to the air entry value sample matric suction increases as the increase of soluble salt content 3 2 test results of fpm the matric suction is caused by the pressure difference between two sides of contracted film structure i e the interface of liquid phase and gas phase in soil which is mainly affected by the soil structure and water content the osmotic suction so is caused by soil solution and mainly affected by the solution concentration the total suction is the sum of matric suction and osmotic suction the swccs of matric suction total suction and osmotic suction with different soluble salt contents obtained by fpm are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the change of the soluble salt content has a limited influence on matric suction the matric suction increases slightly with the increase of soluble salt content especially at low volumetric water content and high suction condition however the total and osmotic suctions increase significantly with the increase of soluble salt content matric suction only affects total suction at low volumetric water content around 8 meanwhile the increase of total suction is mainly caused by osmotic suction at high volumetric water content 13 38 when the volumetric water content decreases and the solution tends to be saturated the osmotic suction has an extreme value which generally not exceed 25 000 kpa similar results can be found in literature sun et al 2013 3 3 the effect of solution concentration and precipitation on suction the effect of soluble salts on swcc is mainly caused by the dissolution and precipitation of soluble salts in soil the pores of samples are filled with the precipitated salt particles which makes the reduction of pore volume and the increase of matric suction however the other soluble salts dissolve in the solution of the samples which causes the solution concentration and the increase of osmotic suction and total suction 3 3 1 calculation of solution concentration and precipitation when the temperature is constant the dissolution and precipitation of the soluble salts can be determined by the difference between the ion product qi and the solubility product ksp of the solution the ion product is the concentration production of each ion in the solution meng et al 1988 and the solubility product of different solutions can be obtained through the method provided in literature speight 2015 shown in table 3 when qi ksp the solution reaches a precipitation dissolution equilibrium state and is saturated when qi ksp the solute is precipitated when qi ksp the solution is unsaturated when the residual concentration of ion is less than 10 5 mol l 1 the ion is completely precipitated meng et al 1988 according to the measured molar concentrations of each ion the added four salt solutions are mgso4 cacl nahco3 naoh and the corresponding ratio is 0 22 0 05 0 03 1 once added the salts will interact and generate less soluble compounds i e mg oh 2 caso4 ca oh 2 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 due to the solubility principle the sequence of precipitation is mg oh 2 caso4 ca oh 2 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 based on the rule of solubility product to calculate the difference between ion product qi and solubility product ksp the mass of the precipitated solute and the solution concentration at different volumetric water contents will then be obtained the specific calculation process is ① considering the solubility of the less soluble compounds here take mg oh 2 as an example firstly calculate the ion product of mg oh 2 and compare with the standard solubility product then determine the precipitation possibility of mg oh 2 when there is no precipitation the salts are completely dissolved when there is precipitation the precipitated value of mg oh 2 will be obtained by the next step ② according to the precipitation dissolution equilibrium formula qi ksp and the minimum ion residual concentration value of 10 5mol l 1 the minimum concentration of oh to precipitate all the remaining mg2 is 1 34 10 3 mol l 1 thus when the actual concentration of oh is larger the mg2 is regarded as completely precipitated and the corresponding mass of mg oh 2 is calculated when they are smaller the residual concentrations of mg2 and oh are calculated by qi ksp ③ according to the solubility rule caso4 ca oh 2 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 repeat step ① ② to calculate the precipitated mass of each compound until there is no precipitation thus the total mass of the precipitated salt msalt will be calculated and the solution concentration is calculated by the following equation 5 k 0 001 α m s m salt m s w 0 001 α m salt 100 where k is the solution concentration msalt is the mass of precipitated salt g table 4 summaries the aforementioned calculation results of solution concentration and precipitation mass for the samples with different soluble salt contents and volumetric water contents 3 3 2 the effect of precipitation on matric suction from table 4 one can conclude that the precipitated salt increases as the increase of soluble salt content and limited precipitated salts dissolve again due to the increase of volumetric water content for fpm at low volumetric water content and high suction conditions the size of pores in the sample is decreased and thus the matric suction is obviously increased due to the filling of the precipitated salts into the original pores in contrary at high volumetric water content and low suction conditions the small pores are almost filled with water and the rest large pores that filled with precipitated salts have limited influences on matric suction however for all the conditions of cm the results show that matric suction increases as the increase of soluble salt content which is different from partial stages of fpm the possible reason is the compression deformation caused by centrifugal force especially at high volumetric water content the size of pores in the sample is decreased due to compression and thus increases the matric suction this magnification effect of soluble salt content on matric suction swcc should be corrected 3 3 3 the effect of solution concentration on total and osmotic suction fig 4 illustrates the variation of solution concentration for different soluble salt contents and volumetric water contents it can be concluded that solution concentration increases significantly with the increase of soluble salt content but gradually decreases and tends to be consistent with the increase of volumetric water content fig 5 shows the relationship between total suction osmotic suction and solution concentration proportional relation can be found for both total suction and osmotic suction the trend of total suction with solution concentration is similar with the trend of osmotic suction and the increase in total suction of the sample is mainly caused by the increase of osmotic suction 4 swcc fitting model 4 1 swcc fitting since 1922 gardner first proposed the swcc fitting model which considers the air entry value and the residual water content the improvement and modification of swcc fitting model has always been a research topic nowadays the most commonly used fitting models are fredlund xing model gardner model and van genuchten model the corresponding equations are ① fredlund xing model 1994 fredlund and xing 1994 6 θ θ s ln e s a n m θ r where θs is the saturated volumetric water content θr is the residual volumetric water content a n and m are the fitting parameters a is the suction value at the inflection point of the curve and slightly larger than air entry value n is a parameter related to the slope of a curve at an inflection point m is the fitting parameter related to the residual volumetric water content xie 2015 ② gardner model 1958 gardner 1958 7 θ θ s θ r s a n 1 θ r where a and n are fitting parameters ③ van genuchten model 1980 van genuchten 1980 8 θ θ s θ r s a n 1 m θ r where a n and m are fitting parameters and m 1 1 n the saturated volumetric water content in eqs 6 8 is normally the physical property of the soil sample but in this paper the soluble salt precipitation need to be considered during the test mg2 can be completely precipitated due to the large content of oh at the same time with the increase of volumetric water content ca2 cannot be completely precipitated however with the residual concentration being less than 0 0003 mol l the remaining ca2 is neglected therefore a basic assumption for the calculation of saturated volumetric water content is that mg2 and ca2 are completely precipitated in the form of mg oh 2 and caso4 and there is no other precipitation thus the mass of precipitation of the saturated sample at a total volume of 100 cm3 is calculated by the molar concentration of mg2 and ca2 as shown in eq 9 9 m salt γ m s 1000 r m g 2 m mg oh 2 r c a 2 m cas o 4 where m salt is the mass of precipitation of the saturated sample at a total volume of 100 cm3 g γ is the content of soluble salt g kg 1 ms is the dry weight of the soil g r m g 2 is the molar concentration of mg2 0 00298 mol g r c a 2 is the molar concentration of ca2 0 000673 mol g m mg oh 2 is the molar mass of mg oh 2 58 g mol m cas o 4 is the molar mass of caso4 136 g mol ws and ms can be calculated by solving two simultaneous eqs 10 and 11 the saturated volumetric water content under different soluble salt contents can then be calculated by eq 12 the corresponding results are shown in table 5 10 s r w g s ρ d g s ρ w ρ d 0 001 α m s m salt m s w s m s m salt g s ρ d g s 0 001 γ m s m salt m s w s m s w s ρ d 1 11 ρ d m s m salt v 12 θ s w s m s where sr is the degree of saturation which is 1 for saturated sample gs is the specific gravity of sample 2 72 w is the liquid content the ratio of solution mass to salt and soil mass ministry of railways first survey and design institute 1998 ρw is the density of the solution g cm3 ρd is the dry density g cm3 ws is the saturated water content v is the volume v 100 cm3 4 1 1 matric suction swcc fitting by using saturated volume water content and the eqs 6 8 the matric suction swccs obtained from the tests are fitted by the lsqnonlin function in matlab the results are shown in tables 6 11 it can be seen from tables 6 to 11 that the matric suction swccs of ili loess under different soluble salt contents are fitted well by these three fitting models and all the r2 are above 0 99 however the fitting parameter θr in fredlund xing model approaches to zero which is inconsistent with its actual physical meaning the regularity of the fitting parameter θr in van genuchten model is not clear especially for matric suction swccs from fpm and partial fitting result are too small to be consistent with the actual situation therefore the gardner model is the most suitable fitting model with r2 over 0 97 and is used for swcc fitting of ili loess in this research the matric suction fitting results by gardner model fitting are shown in fig 6 4 1 2 total suction swcc fitting the fpm has certain limitation for the test range in measuring total suction at low total suction stage the water content of filter paper after balancing is too large which can easily be significantly influenced by the environment such as temperature thus the value cannot be accurately measured and finally affects the accuracy of matric suction the test results are reliable only when the total suction range is 103 5 105 kpa lu and likos 2012 therefore at high volume water content and low suction conditions the test result from fpm is incomplete which generates difficulties for the commonly used fitting models the residual volumetric water content reflects the boundary of the pore water in the soil from the combined water and capillary water to the gravity water when the volumetric water content is lower than the residual volumetric water content the water in the soil is dominated by the combined water and capillary water xie 2015 which makes the matric suction increase significantly as the combined water cannot dissolve salts ministry of railways first survey and design institute 1998 and there is very few capillary water content the osmotic suction is negligible so the total suction basically has the same value as matric suction xie 2015 meanwhile the total suction swcc and matric suction swcc should have similar residual volumetric water content by using saturated and residual volume water content obtained from matric suction fitting and gardner model good fitting results are obtained for total suction swcc as shown in fig 7 and table 12 excellent fitting results are obtained in comparison with the experiments especially at low total suction conditions the small difference at high total suction conditions mainly refers to the residual volume water content parts thus it can be concluded that gardner model best fits the swcc of ili loess in xinjiang with different soluble salt contents 4 2 fitting model 4 2 1 matric suction swcc fitting model based on the analysis of the fitting parameters of the matric suction swcc fig 8 shows the relationship between the fitting parameters a n θr of gardner model and the soluble salt content γ obtained by cm and fpm although there are some differences in the value and the variation tendency of the parameters which mainly occurs on a a linear relationship between a and γ is obtained the difference of a is mainly caused by the different experiment principle of the two methods in addition the compression deformation from cm contributes certain increase of matric suction especially at high volumetric water content conditions the matric suction swcc fitting model of ili loess considering soluble salt content is obtained by normalization which uses a and γ with gardner model and averages other parameters eq 13 eq 13 is able to reveal the characteristic of matric suction of ili loess under the coupling effect of soluble salt content and volumetric water content the fitting results are shown in fig 9 13 θ θ s θ r s m c γ d n 1 θ r where n 1 137 θs 49 36 θr 11 97 c 0 176 d 15 725 cm n 0 704 θs 50 91 θr 8 44 c 0 391 d 29 343 fpm 4 2 2 total suction swcc fitting model in a similar way the total suction swcc fitting parameters of gardner model indicate that the parameter a varies greatly with soluble salt content γ see fig 10 the total suction swcc fitting model of ili loess considering the coupling influences of soluble salt content and volumetric water content is shown in eq 14 14 θ θ s θ r s t p e qy n 1 θ r where n 1 603 p 235 839 q 0 131 fig 11 illustrates the fitting result of eq 14 and the experimental data a good fitting is obtained besides eq 14 is applicable of calculating the total suction swcc of ili loess under different soluble salt contents by comparing fig 9 with fig 11 the conclusion is made that total suction is easily affected by the soluble salt content 4 3 model validation for validation purpose eq 13 is used to fit the matric suction swcc of different nacl content used in literature fattah et al 2013b a good fitting result is obtained r2 0 94 which is shown in fig 12 due to the lack of test data in literature the fitting of eq 14 is not conducted however the total suction swcc of different nacl content used in literature of fattah et al 2013 is fitted by gardner model see fig 13 and a good fitting result is obtained fig 14 shows the exponential relationship between fitting parameter a and nacl content γ 5 conclusions this paper investigated the swcc of ili loess with different high level of soluble salts and the corresponding fitting model using centrifuge method and filter paper method from the experimental investigations the conclusions are 1 the soluble salt content has a limited influence on matric suction but a great influence on total and osmotic suction 2 the total and osmotic suctions increase significantly with the increase of soluble salt content besides the influences of soluble salts on suctions are also studied by calculating the precipitation and dissolution of soluble salts and the conclusion is that the large influences of soluble salts on total and osmotic suction of ili loess mainly come from the change of solution concentration based on the gardner model new swcc fitting models of total suction and matric suction which can comprehensively consider the coupling of soluble salt content and volumetric water content are proposed and validated
