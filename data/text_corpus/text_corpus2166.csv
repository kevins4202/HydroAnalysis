10830,drip irrigation with plastic film mulching pm is an important agricultural practice used to conserve soil water and produce higher crop yields worldwide however the plastic film is usually made from non degradable polyethylene materials which may lead to the incorporation of plastic into soils and cause a series of negative environmental effects as such biodegradable film mulching bm can represent a valuable alternative to pm a two year experiment was carried out during the 2014 and 2015 seasons to evaluate the effects of pm bm and no film mulching nm on the soil water balance in the corn field the two dimensional numerical hydrus 2d model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected in 2014 and 2015 respectively under bm pm and nm and then used to evaluate soil water contents swc water fluxes and soil water balances in two dimensional soil profiles the results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with measurements with the mean relative errors for the calibration and validation periods for bm pm and nm of 11 2 10 7 and 11 7 respectively the results showed that swcs were similar in the bm and pm scenarios during early and middle crop growth periods significant differences in swcs were observed only after the average fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film was equal or higher than about 40 during the late crop growth period the results also showed that mulching mainly affects swcs in the top 0 20 cm soil layer there were significant differences in cumulative evaporation and water fluxes between different treatments but an insignificant difference in root water uptake between pm and bm cumulative evaporation for bm increased by 30 5 compared to pm and decreased by 41 9 compared to nm corresponding cumulative water fluxes at the 80 cm depth increased and decreased by 6 6 and 48 8 respectively two dimensional simulations of soil water content distributions revealed that the water stress area in the soil profile with swcs lower than readily available water before irrigation was 1 79 and 0 75 times larger for bm than for pm and nm respectively swcs in the surface soil layer of bm also increased after rainfall during the late crop growth period which improved the rainwater use efficiency by 8 2 compared to pm both experiments and simulations revealed that bm has more comparable soil moisture dynamics to pm than to nm keywords drip irrigation biodegradable film mulching plastic film mulching soil water hydrus 2d 1 introduction agricultural plastic film mulching pm can reduce soil evaporation by cutting off the vapor transport path between the soil surface and the atmosphere it has significant advantages compared to no mulching nm such as decreasing weed growth martín et al 2017 conserving soil moisture kader et al 2017 stabilizing the daily range of soil temperatures increasing the water use efficiency wue and improving crop yields taparauskiene and miseckaite 2014 yu et al 2018 jia et al 2018 as a result plastic films are widely used in crop production systems due to their agronomic benefits for example in 2012 more than sixty thousand ha of greenhouses in spain used pm department of agriculture food and environment of spain 2012 and its use was increasing annually by 5 7 transparency market research 2016 in china the world s largest plastic film user the amount of applied plastic film increased nearly five fold from 3 105 tons to 14 7 105 from 1991 to 2017 gao et al 2019 however since plastic films made of non degradable polyethylene materials are very hard to degrade in soil ammala et al 2011 steinmetz et al 2016 bläsing and amelung 2018 their use likely leads to a gradual increase of plastic fragments in soil steinmetz et al 2016 liu et al 2014 causing a series of negative environmental effects these include lower soil porosity and air circulation which affects soil water movement and solute transport as well as reduced crop root growth jiang et al 2017 the release of phthalate acid esters and other toxins ramos et al 2015 and lower crop yields a promising alternative to pm is biodegradable film mostly made of polysaccharides such as cellulose and starch which can be directly degraded to co2 and h2o and that can retain the advantages and overcome the shortcomings of plastic films kijchavengkul et al 2008a b gu et al 2017 moreno et al 2016 reported that 200 days after the incorporation of a biodegradable film into the soil the concentration of its residues was very small similarly as associated environmental effects there is also evidence that biodegradable film mulching bm provides similar benefits as pm costa et al 2014 and in most studies there were no significant differences in crop yields gu et al 2017 moreno and moreno 2008 costa et al 2014 ghimire et al 2018 pm effectively reduces soil evaporation and increases the soil water content in the upper soil layer by increasing the resistance to vapor flow between the soil surface and the atmosphere li et al 2015 saglam et al 2017 for example soil evaporation declined by as much as 90 when pm was used liu et al 2013 and it decreased by almost 50 under pine bark mulching anlauf et al 2016 there is also clear evidence that higher soil temperatures and soil water storage in the crop root zone under bm can significantly increase crop growth and crop yield compared to no film mulching nm gu et al 2017 yao et al 2017 ghimire et al 2018 however while the effects of pm and bm on increasing soil temperature and soil water storage are similar early after their application kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 yao et al 2017 ghimire et al 2018 they decrease significantly after 150 days due to the degradation of the biodegradable film for bm gu et al 2017 the use of different mulching technologies leads to different values of soil evaporation soil water storage and water fluxes these differences may be further enhanced by the presence of shallow groundwater especially in arid regions since the establishment of a reasonable irrigation scheme requires a precise knowledge of soil water dynamics many field experiments would need to be conducted which would be highly time consuming and costly the alternative low cost approach would be to simulate the effects of these factors using a mathematical model which could also provide additional details about soil water dynamics in the root zone in the past decades several types of mathematical models such as empirical analytical and numerical models have been used to assess the soil water pattern under drip irrigation e g philip 1968 warrick 1974 schwartzman and zur 1986 cook et al 2003 šimůnek et al 2016 among these models hydrus 2d has been widely used to simulate soil water movement for different irrigation methods and management strategies due to its ﬂexibility in accommodating different types of boundary conditions e g li et al 2015 chen et al 2018 altaf et al 2014 šimůnek et al 2016 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2018 hydrus 2d has been shown to provide a reasonable agreement between simulated and measured soil water contents and solute concentrations in soil profiles with drip irrigation and pm selim et al 2013 li et al 2015 chen et al 2014 although most studies represented the mulching boundary as a zero flux plane selim et al 2013 chen et al 2018 several others regarded it as a time variable flux boundary because a plastic film damaged during crop growth allows some water to flow through this boundary li et al 2015 liu et al 2013 the fraction of a disintegrated area is significantly higher for a biodegradable film than for a plastic film during the middle and late crop growth stages moreno et al 2017 as a result the original zero flux plane of a mulching boundary vanishes soil water starts flowing up from the soil to the atmosphere and the soil water content in the upper soil layer decreases compared to pm gu et al 2017 saglam et al 2017 simulated the soil water dynamics using hydrus 2d representing a biodegradable film boundary as a partially permeable surface layer and a plastic film boundary as an impermeable surface layer their results showed that there were higher soil water contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer for pm and higher soil evaporation also considering infiltration from rainfall infiltration for bm however saglam et al 2017 only focused on the accuracy between simulated and measured soil water contents and the two dimensional water content distributions in the root zone they did not analyze water fluxes for different boundaries the soil water balance or the water use efficiency they also did not quantify the contribution of shallow groundwater to water use that may reduce the volume of water required for irrigation in arid regions with shallow groundwater satchithanantham et al 2014 soil water contents water fluxes soil water balances and the contribution of shallow groundwater should thus be further evaluated under bm pm and nm in the field additionally actual and cumulative soil water fluxes under different fractions of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film afd should also be evaluated the main objectives of this study thus are i to calibrate and validate the hydrus 2d model for a corn soil system under pm bm and nm ii to evaluate soil water contents and water fluxes under pm bm and nm and iii to compare soil water balances and two dimensional soil water distributions in soil profiles under pm bm and nm 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experimental

of three replicates of three treatments with plastic film mulching pm biodegradable film mulching bm and no film mulching nm the experimental crop was corn zea mays l one drip line with a 30 cm emitter spacing and an irrigation rate of 2 4 l per hour was used for two corn rows with a 50 cm row spacing one film strip 80 cm wide was used for two corn rows in order to reduce costs fig 1 seed corn was sown on april 20 and april 17 and harvested on september 26 and september 25 in 2014 and 2015 respectively drip irrigation was applied at each plot with dimensions of 20 30 m the amount of

measured using pressure transduces onset computer inc u20 hobo usa which were installed in an observation well 3 m deep with a 5 cm internal diameter data were averaged and recorded at one day intervals and stored in a datalogger from which they were automatically downloaded the spatial distribution of corn roots was measured using root samples collected from a soil transect li et al 2017 root samples were scanned using a root system scan reagent instru perfection 4870photo epson japan with the 450 dpi resolution on june 7 june 23 july 20 and august 22 in the 2014 season as well as on june 12 june 31 july 22 and august 25 in the 2015 season since the fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film fd varied in the direction perpendicular to the drip tape the mulching region was divided into three parts r1 r2 and r3 fig 1 the region around the dripper r1 0 10 cm had maximum disintegration while the region furthest from the dripper r3 25 40 cm had least disintegration fig 4 the fd for three different regions was calculated using the following equation 1 f d 1 a 1 a 1 100 2 f d 2 a 2 a 2 100 3 f d 3 a 3 a 3 100 where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are total areas of film mulching in different regions cm2 and a 1 a 2 and a 3 are total areas of the disintegrated biodegradable film in different regions cm2 these mulching and disintegrated areas were measured every 10 days during the crop growth season while remaining values were obtained by a linear interpolation since the widths of three different regions are different the average fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film afd is calculated using the weighted average as follows 4 a f d 1 l i 1 n f d i w i where l is the width of the mulching area cm set to be 40 cm and wi is the width of different regions which were 10 15 and 15 cm for r1 r2 and r3 respectively 2 3 model description 2 3 1 main equations the hydrus 2d model šimůnek et al 2016 was used in this study to simulate soil

averaged during two time intervals i e doy day of year 110 169 170 270 to reduce the error of not considering a dynamic root growth fig 5 we assumed that the root length was equal to a relative value of 1 0 in the 10 10 cm square directly beneath the corn stem and correspondingly adjusted the relative root length density values elsewhere šimůnek et al 2016 liu et al 2013 in the hydrus 2d transport

domain the left and right vertical sides of the ﬂow domain were assigned the no flow boundary condition the top boundary i e the soil surface reflected three different mulching scenarios in the bm scenario the mulching soil surface 0 40 cm was divided into three parts fig 1 to represent an uneven disintegration of bm the soil surface up to 10 cm away from the emitter r1 was assigned the time

scenario the mulching soil surface 0 40 cm was assigned the no flow boundary condition in both of these scenarios bm and pm the bare section of the soil surface p2 was assigned the atmospheric boundary condition in the nm scenario the entire soil surface 0 60 cm was assigned the atmospheric boundary condition the initial conditions were set using water contents measured before sowing of corn and interpolating linearly between locations with measured values the top and bottom water contents were 0 20 and 0 35 cm3 cm 3 respectively the horizontal distribution of the initial water content was assumed to be uniform 2 3 5 soil hydraulic parameters and emitter flow soil hydraulic parameters for different soil layers were first estimated using the rosetta software package schaap et al 2001 and its neural network based pedotransfer functions from percentages of sand silt and clay and the soil bulk density table 1 the α n and k s parameters were be further calibrated using the inverse approach in hydrus 2d lazarovitch et al 2007 the emitter flux in hydrus 2d was calculated using the following equation skaggs et al 2004 16 q q l 2 π r where q is the emitter flux 15 9 cm h 1

measured values was evaluated using the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 as follows 17 m r e 1 n i 1 n s i m i m i 100 18 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 19 r 2 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where si and mi are simulated and measured values respectively and n is the number of data points 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the values of r 2 rmse and mre for volumetric soil water contents swcs are shown in table 2 for the bm pm and nm scenarios for both calibration 2014 and validation 2015 periods the average r 2 for the calibration and validation periods for the bm pm and nm scenarios were 0 76 0 75 and 0 73 respectively the average rmse for the calibration and validation periods for the bm pm and nm scenarios were 0 03 0 03 and 0 04 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the average mre for the calibration and validation periods for the bm pm and nm scenarios were 11 2 10 7 and 11 7 respectively the model accuracy for bm was lower than for pm and it decreased on average by 1 3 9 5 and 4 7 for r 2 rmse and mre respectively however the error measures showed that in general there was a high consistency between measured and simulated swcs for bm pm and nm during both calibration and validation periods that meet the requirements of soil water simulations since swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer were more dynamic and greatly affected by irrigation and precipitation modeling errors increased and the model accuracy decreased in this soil layer and even more in the 0 10 cm soil layer compared to the subsoil layers the average r 2 rmse and mre values were 0 71 0 05 cm3 cm 3 and 12 65 respectively for the top 0 20 cm soil layer and 0 78 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and 10 27 respectively for the 20 100 cm soil layer it can thus be concluded that the hydrus 2d model performed well in simulating swcs in the root zone of the soil profile under all mulching scenarios 3 2 comparison of swcs between different film mulching scenarios swcs at the p1 position were selected for further analysis as they were more dynamic and more affected by irrigation and mulching than at the p2 position the entire crop growing season was divided into three time periods to differentiate the effects of different degrees of disintegration of the biodegradable film an early period with no difference between bm and pm doy 110 165 in 2014 and 113 176 in 2015 year a middle period with a small difference doy 166 234 in 2014 and 177 238 in 2015 and a late period with a significant difference doy 235 270 in 2014 and 239 270 in 2015 there were insignificant differences in measured swcs between bm and pm during the early period without film disintegration fig 6 swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer were by about 0 9 and 0 6 lower under bm than under pm during the middle period in 2014 and 2015 respectively however they were 2 6 and 5 2 higher respectively than under nm during the late period with significant differences between bm and pm swcs decreased by 7 8 and 6 2 under bm compared to pm during 2014 and 2015 respectively while they increased by 12 5 and 15 3 respectively compared to nm these significant differences in swcs were caused by significant disintegration of the biodegradable film which disintegrated by 39 7 and 37 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively during the late period overall there were statistically significant differences in swcs between pm and bm during about 36 and 32 days of 2014 and 2015 respectively overall while there was no statistically significant difference between average swcs under bm and pm during the entire growing period they were both significantly higher than under nm the average swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer during 2 years were 0 254 0 253 and 0 245 cm3 cm 3 under pm bm and nm respectively it is apparent that mulching mainly affects swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer fig 6 as discussed above swcs under bm were almost the same as under pm until a significant disintegration of the biodegradable film occurred there was a statistically insignificant difference between swcs under bm and pm throughout the growing period but both swcs were statistically significantly higher than under nm 3 3 simulated soil water fluxes since roots were predominantly present in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer the maximum rooting depth was about 80 cm fig 5 root water uptake occurred mainly from this soil layer and significantly affected water fluxes from to deeper soil layers the average cumulative flux positive upward at the 20 cm depth cf20 during 2014 and 2015 under bm was 1 72 times larger than under pm and 1 31 times smaller than under nm p 0 05 respectively fig 7 a and b the average cf20 was 12 43 mm higher under bm than under pm the average cumulative flux at the 80 cm depth cf80 increased 6 62 under bm compared to pm however the maximum cumulative flux of 92 3 mm occurred under nm and was 58 6 and 48 8 higher than under pm and bm respectively fig 7c and d overall the cf20 and cf80 fluxes were mainly upward representing a capillary rise from groundwater the cf20 flux accounted for 30 0 32 8 and 41 2 of the cf80 flux under pm bm and nm respectively as the biodegradable film disintegrated evaporation significantly increased fig 7e and f the average cumulative surface flux during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 for pm bm and nm were 41 0 54 9 and 106 6 mm respectively the average cumulative surface flux for bm was 33 8 higher than for pm and 48 5 lower than for nm average root water uptake in 2014 and 2015 fig 7g and h under pm and bm were not significantly different p 0 05 but increased by 5 57 and 4 19 compared to nm respectively 3 4 effects of different film mulching on soil water balance components simulated soil water balance components for the root zone 0 80 cm depth for all mulching scenarios are shown in table 3 mulching significantly affected evaporation average evaporation during 2 years for bm increased by 30 5 17 5 mm compared to pm but decreased by 41 9 53 9 mm compared to nm different types of mulching significantly decreased soil evaporation and consequently also affected i e lowered capillary rise from shallow groundwater fig 7 average capillary rise i e negative drainage for nm increased by 58 6 and 48 8 compared to pm and bm during two growing seasons table 3 however upward groundwater flux for bm was only about 6 6 higher than for pm because larger disintegration of the biodegradable film occurred only at the end of the crop growing period average upward groundwater fluxes for pm bm and nm accounted for 13 0 13 5 and 18 6 of water losses i e root water uptake and evaporation respectively while there was only a small difference in root water uptake between pm and bm there was a significant difference between nm and the other two mulching treatments the difference between the maximum pm and minimum nm root water uptake was 20 5 mm while the change in the soil water storage at the end of the season increased with the degree of the active mulching area table 3 there was only a small difference between bm and pm as a whole water balance components were not significantly different between bm and pm indicating that the biodegradable film can be used to replace the plastic film in semi arid regions e g in the hetao irrigation district 3 5 effects of irrigation and rainfall on two dimensional soil water content distributions since the effects of irrigation and rainfall on soil water distributions were similar during 2014 and 2015 only the results for 2014 will be discussed below two dimensional soil water content distributions in the root zone 0 80 cm for pm bm and nm on doy 188 i e before irrigation 190 i e one day after irrigation and 192 i e one day after rainfall of 2014 are shown in fig 8 swc profiles for different mulching scenarios are different mainly in the top 0 30 cm soil layer especially in the 0 20 cm layer fig 8 the maximum difference in swcs occurred before irrigation fig 8 when the water stress area i e locations with swcs lower than readily available water θraw 0 19 cm3 cm 3 in this study allen et al 1998 was about 304 544 and 729 cm2 for pm bm and nm respectively the water stress area was about 1 79 and 0 75 times larger for bm than for pm and nm respectively in addition θraw was reached at depths of 18 3 27 4 and 29 5 cm for pm bm and nm respectively swcs increased in the 0 20 cm soil layer 1 day after irrigation and the wetting area i e swcs equal to or larger than field capacity was 120 9 112 8 and 64 0 cm2 for pm bm and nm respectively differences in wetting areas of different scenarios were caused mainly by differences in pre irrigation saturations because rainwater could infiltrate directly into the soil in the nm scenario and at locations of film disintegration in the bm scenario the swc in these two scenarios were higher than in the pm scenario one day after rainfall i e doy 192 fig 8 the swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer three days after rainfall increased by 12 0 and 8 1 for bm compared to pm in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 6 the bm scenario can thus increase rainwater use efficiency rue compared to pm for example rue for bm improved on average by 8 2 compared to pm due to the disintegration of the film in short there was no swc deficit for bm compared to pm and nm fig 8 because of decreasing evaporation and increasing rue 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of bm on soil water the average fraction of the disintegrated biodegradable film afd reached 39 7 and 37 1 during the later stages of the crop growing season in 2014 and 2015 respectively which was much higher than for the plastic film these results are similar to those of saglam et al 2017 and explain differences in the spatial and temporal distributions of swcs between bm and pm there were no significant differences in swc profiles between bm and pm fig 6 early in the season before the biodegradable film started disintegrating significant differences onlyoccurred late in the growing season when afd reached 38 4 fig 4 swcs for bm were usually lower than for pm sun et al 2018 especially when irrigation and rainfall events did not occur 6 7 days prior khan et al 2016 in this study swcs for bm were significantly lower than for pm during some irrigation intervals fig 6 which is similar to the results of khan et al 2016 furthermore not only did bm effectively decrease evaporation losses compared to nm but it also produce higher swcs in the root zone after rainfalls during the disintegration season fig 7 h as the mulched area decreased with increasing afd during the late stages of the growing season for bm rainwater could more easily infiltrate into the soil increase swcs and effectively improve rue compared to pm which had little film disintegration saglam et al 2017 sun et al 2018 there were obvious differences in swcs between bm and pm because of bm disintegration especially in the 0 20 cm soil layer and in time periods after irrigation or rainfall figs 7 and 8 the main reason was evaporation and soil water loss from the surface soil layer the effect of mulching on swcs was usually only found in the top 0 20 cm soil layer fig 6 which was similar to the results of selim et al 2013 gao et al 2014 also indicated that significant differences in swcs occurred only in the top 0 20 cm soil layer between mulching and no mulching locations and that mulching could increase swcs by 15 compared to no mulching as discussed above differences in the active not disintegrated mulching area of the biodegradable film caused different swc distributions in the soil profile similarly as in saglam et al 2017 the averaged measured fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film afd at the very last day of the season was 54 4 while the low and high afd values were either lower or higher by 30 compared to the mean afd value the swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer of the bm treatment with low afd was almost the same as for the pm treatment fig 9 however swcs for the bm treatment under the medium and high afd decreased by 3 5 and 6 3 compared to pm respectively the swc decreased linearly with increasing afd y 0 0071x 0 2616 in the late crop growth period swcs for low medium and high afd were lower by 6 5 100 and 13 5 than for pm respectively fig 9 4 2 evaluation of cumulative soil water fluxes the extent of mulching has a negative relationship with evaporation fig 7 i e evaporation from the bm system is higher than from the pm system and the nm system has significantly higher evaporation than the mulching scenarios bm and pm han et al 2015 soil water losses are reduced by mulching especially in semi arid regions with intensive evaporation zhang et al 2018 in addition different irrigation patterns and mulching materials also affect soil evaporation for example evaporation from soils with large frequent irrigations is smaller than from soils with small frequent irrigations he et al 2018 in addition dlamini et al 2017 found that in semiarid areas mulching with sand similarly as with pm and bm can also significantly reduce evaporation in comparison to no mulching table 3 corn roots about 66 70 were mainly distributed in the shallow soil layer 0 30 cm which was the main crop root water uptake layer li et al 2017 this layer can be easily affected by evaporation irrigation and rainfall he et al 2018 reported that seasonal corn root water uptake ranged from 348 to 394 mm under different soil water conditions which was similar to this study table 4 due to the shallow groundwater table in the hetao irrigation district groundwater contributed significantly to crop root water uptake e g forkutsa et al 2009 liu et al 2016 ayars et al 2006 forkutsa et al 2009 indicated that about 79 106 mm of crop root water uptake came from groundwater under the sandy loam soil liu et al 2016 indicated that the groundwater contribution reached about 20 40 of crop water consumption ayars et al 2006 reported that groundwater contributed about 0 29 in the silt loam soil while in this study it only contributed about 13 19 the upward groundwater flux and evaporation were directly related to afd table 4 the groundwater flux for bm under high afd was 70 8 mm which was 1 32 and 1 27 times higher than under low and medium afd respectively evaporation under high afd increased by 30 1 and 17 7 mm compared to under low and medium afd respectively the groundwater flux and evaporation increased by 1 05 mm and 2 46 mm respectively when 1 cm2 of plastic film disintegrated the contribution of groundwater increased with afd according to y 0 16x 24 43 where x is afd in cm2 and y is the groundwater uptake amount in mm however root water uptake was only slightly affected by afd root water uptake values decreased only slightly from low to medium and high afds the maximum difference in cumulative root water uptake was reached between low and high afd and was only 8 5 mm 5 conclusions numerical modeling based on hydrus 2d was used in this study to evaluate the effects of bm on swcs and water fluxes the model was first calibrated and validated using experimental data from two seasons of 2014 and 2015 in general there was good agreement between the results of numerical simulations and measurements the benefits of bm were similar to those of pm both mulching scenarios bm and pm functioned similarly during the early growing season before film disintegration significant differences occurred only in the late growing season when afd was equal to or higher than 38 4 additionally differences in swcs were only found in the top 0 20 cm soil layer average cumulative evaporation and average cumulative fluxes at depths of 20 and 80 cm were significantly different for different mulching scenarios increasing from pm to bm and further to nm p 0 05 two dimensional soil water content distributions showed that before irrigation the water stress area in the surface soil layer of the bm soil was larger than in the pm soil and significantly lower than in the nm soil swcs in the root zone after rainfall would increase in the bm system during the disintegration season and effectively improve rue the effects of film disintegration on swcs and water fluxes were effectively simulated using hydrus 2d bm is recommended as a viable option to replace pm in regions with shallow groundwater acknowledgements this research was jointly supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfc0400205 national natural

10830,drip irrigation with plastic film mulching pm is an important agricultural practice used to conserve soil water and produce higher crop yields worldwide however the plastic film is usually made from non degradable polyethylene materials which may lead to the incorporation of plastic into soils and cause a series of negative environmental effects as such biodegradable film mulching bm can represent a valuable alternative to pm a two year experiment was carried out during the 2014 and 2015 seasons to evaluate the effects of pm bm and no film mulching nm on the soil water balance in the corn field the two dimensional numerical hydrus 2d model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected in 2014 and 2015 respectively under bm pm and nm and then used to evaluate soil water contents swc water fluxes and soil water balances in two dimensional soil profiles the results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with measurements with the mean relative errors for the calibration and validation periods for bm pm and nm of 11 2 10 7 and 11 7 respectively the results showed that swcs were similar in the bm and pm scenarios during early and middle crop growth periods significant differences in swcs were observed only after the average fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film was equal or higher than about 40 during the late crop growth period the results also showed that mulching mainly affects swcs in the top 0 20 cm soil layer there were significant differences in cumulative evaporation and water fluxes between different treatments but an insignificant difference in root water uptake between pm and bm cumulative evaporation for bm increased by 30 5 compared to pm and decreased by 41 9 compared to nm corresponding cumulative water fluxes at the 80 cm depth increased and decreased by 6 6 and 48 8 respectively two dimensional simulations of soil water content distributions revealed that the water stress area in the soil profile with swcs lower than readily available water before irrigation was 1 79 and 0 75 times larger for bm than for pm and nm respectively swcs in the surface soil layer of bm also increased after rainfall during the late crop growth period which improved the rainwater use efficiency by 8 2 compared to pm both experiments and simulations revealed that bm has more comparable soil moisture dynamics to pm than to nm keywords drip irrigation biodegradable film mulching plastic film mulching soil water hydrus 2d 1 introduction agricultural plastic film mulching pm can reduce soil evaporation by cutting off the vapor transport path between the soil surface and the atmosphere it has significant advantages compared to no mulching nm such as decreasing weed growth martín et al 2017 conserving soil moisture kader et al 2017 stabilizing the daily range of soil temperatures increasing the water use efficiency wue and improving crop yields taparauskiene and miseckaite 2014 yu et al 2018 jia et al 2018 as a result plastic films are widely used in crop production systems due to their agronomic benefits for example in 2012 more than sixty thousand ha of greenhouses in spain used pm department of agriculture food and environment of spain 2012 and its use was increasing annually by 5 7 transparency market research 2016 in china the world s largest plastic film user the amount of applied plastic film increased nearly five fold from 3 105 tons to 14 7 105 from 1991 to 2017 gao et al 2019 however since plastic films made of non degradable polyethylene materials are very hard to degrade in soil ammala et al 2011 steinmetz et al 2016 bläsing and amelung 2018 their use likely leads to a gradual increase of plastic fragments in soil steinmetz et al 2016 liu et al 2014 causing a series of negative environmental effects these include lower soil porosity and air circulation which affects soil water movement and solute transport as well as reduced crop root growth jiang et al 2017 the release of phthalate acid esters and other toxins ramos et al 2015 and lower crop yields a promising alternative to pm is biodegradable film mostly made of polysaccharides such as cellulose and starch which can be directly degraded to co2 and h2o and that can retain the advantages and overcome the shortcomings of plastic films kijchavengkul et al 2008a b gu et al 2017 moreno et al 2016 reported that 200 days after the incorporation of a biodegradable film into the soil the concentration of its residues was very small similarly as associated environmental effects there is also evidence that biodegradable film mulching bm provides similar benefits as pm costa et al 2014 and in most studies there were no significant differences in crop yields gu et al 2017 moreno and moreno 2008 costa et al 2014 ghimire et al 2018 pm effectively reduces soil evaporation and increases the soil water content in the upper soil layer by increasing the resistance to vapor flow between the soil surface and the atmosphere li et al 2015 saglam et al 2017 for example soil evaporation declined by as much as 90 when pm was used liu et al 2013 and it decreased by almost 50 under pine bark mulching anlauf et al 2016 there is also clear evidence that higher soil temperatures and soil water storage in the crop root zone under bm can significantly increase crop growth and crop yield compared to no film mulching nm gu et al 2017 yao et al 2017 ghimire et al 2018 however while the effects of pm and bm on increasing soil temperature and soil water storage are similar early after their application kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 yao et al 2017 ghimire et al 2018 they decrease significantly after 150 days due to the degradation of the biodegradable film for bm gu et al 2017 the use of different mulching technologies leads to different values of soil evaporation soil water storage and water fluxes these differences may be further enhanced by the presence of shallow groundwater especially in arid regions since the establishment of a reasonable irrigation scheme requires a precise knowledge of soil water dynamics many field experiments would need to be conducted which would be highly time consuming and costly the alternative low cost approach would be to simulate the effects of these factors using a mathematical model which could also provide additional details about soil water dynamics in the root zone in the past decades several types of mathematical models such as empirical analytical and numerical models have been used to assess the soil water pattern under drip irrigation e g philip 1968 warrick 1974 schwartzman and zur 1986 cook et al 2003 šimůnek et al 2016 among these models hydrus 2d has been widely used to simulate soil water movement for different irrigation methods and management strategies due to its ﬂexibility in accommodating different types of boundary conditions e g li et al 2015 chen et al 2018 altaf et al 2014 šimůnek et al 2016 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2018 hydrus 2d has been shown to provide a reasonable agreement between simulated and measured soil water contents and solute concentrations in soil profiles with drip irrigation and pm selim et al 2013 li et al 2015 chen et al 2014 although most studies represented the mulching boundary as a zero flux plane selim et al 2013 chen et al 2018 several others regarded it as a time variable flux boundary because a plastic film damaged during crop growth allows some water to flow through this boundary li et al 2015 liu et al 2013 the fraction of a disintegrated area is significantly higher for a biodegradable film than for a plastic film during the middle and late crop growth stages moreno et al 2017 as a result the original zero flux plane of a mulching boundary vanishes soil water starts flowing up from the soil to the atmosphere and the soil water content in the upper soil layer decreases compared to pm gu et al 2017 saglam et al 2017 simulated the soil water dynamics using hydrus 2d representing a biodegradable film boundary as a partially permeable surface layer and a plastic film boundary as an impermeable surface layer their results showed that there were higher soil water contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer for pm and higher soil evaporation also considering infiltration from rainfall infiltration for bm however saglam et al 2017 only focused on the accuracy between simulated and measured soil water contents and the two dimensional water content distributions in the root zone they did not analyze water fluxes for different boundaries the soil water balance or the water use efficiency they also did not quantify the contribution of shallow groundwater to water use that may reduce the volume of water required for irrigation in arid regions with shallow groundwater satchithanantham et al 2014 soil water contents water fluxes soil water balances and the contribution of shallow groundwater should thus be further evaluated under bm pm and nm in the field additionally actual and cumulative soil water fluxes under different fractions of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film afd should also be evaluated the main objectives of this study thus are i to calibrate and validate the hydrus 2d model for a corn soil system under pm bm and nm ii to evaluate soil water contents and water fluxes under pm bm and nm and iii to compare soil water balances and two dimensional soil water distributions in soil profiles under pm bm and nm 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experimental

june 12 june 31 july 22 and august 25 in the 2015 season since the fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film fd varied in the direction perpendicular to the drip tape the mulching region was divided into three parts r1 r2 and r3 fig 1 the region around the dripper r1 0 10 cm had maximum disintegration while the region furthest from the dripper r3 25 40 cm had least disintegration fig 4 the fd for three different regions was calculated using the following equation 1 f d 1 a 1 a 1 100 2 f d 2 a 2 a 2 100 3 f d 3 a 3 a 3 100 where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are total areas of film mulching in different regions cm2 and a 1 a 2 and a 3 are total areas of the disintegrated biodegradable film in different regions cm2 these mulching and disintegrated areas were measured every 10 days during the crop growth season while remaining values were obtained by a linear interpolation since the widths of three different regions are different the average fraction of the disintegrated

scenario the mulching soil surface 0 40 cm was divided into three parts fig 1 to represent an uneven disintegration of bm the soil surface up to 10 cm away from the emitter r1 was assigned the time

scenario the mulching soil surface 0 40 cm was assigned the no flow boundary condition in both of these scenarios bm and pm the bare section of the soil surface p2 was assigned the atmospheric boundary condition in the nm scenario the entire soil surface 0 60 cm was assigned the atmospheric boundary condition the initial conditions were set using water contents measured before sowing of corn and interpolating linearly between locations with measured values the top and bottom water contents were 0 20 and 0 35 cm3 cm 3 respectively the horizontal distribution of the initial water content was assumed to be uniform 2 3 5 soil hydraulic parameters and emitter flow soil hydraulic parameters for different soil layers were first estimated using the rosetta software package schaap et

the values of r 2 rmse and mre for volumetric soil water contents swcs are shown in table 2 for the bm pm and nm scenarios for both calibration 2014 and validation 2015 periods the average r 2 for the calibration and validation periods for the bm pm and nm scenarios were 0 76 0 75 and 0 73 respectively the average rmse for the calibration and validation periods for the bm pm and nm scenarios were 0 03 0 03 and 0 04 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the average mre for the calibration and validation periods for the bm pm and nm scenarios were 11 2 10 7 and 11 7 respectively the model accuracy for bm was lower than for pm and it decreased on average by 1 3 9 5 and 4 7 for r 2 rmse and mre respectively however the error measures showed that in general there was a high consistency between measured and simulated swcs for bm pm and nm during both calibration and validation periods that meet the requirements of soil water simulations since swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer were more dynamic and greatly affected by irrigation and precipitation modeling errors increased and the model accuracy decreased in this soil layer and even more in the 0 10 cm soil layer compared to the subsoil layers the average r 2 rmse and mre values were 0 71 0 05 cm3 cm 3 and 12 65 respectively for the top 0 20 cm soil layer and 0 78 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and 10 27 respectively for the 20 100 cm soil layer it can thus be concluded that the hydrus 2d model performed well in simulating swcs in the root zone of the soil profile under all mulching scenarios 3 2 comparison of swcs between different film mulching scenarios swcs at the p1 position were selected for further analysis as they were more dynamic and more affected by irrigation and mulching than at the p2 position the entire crop growing season was divided into three time periods to differentiate the effects of different degrees of disintegration of the biodegradable film an early period with no difference between bm and pm doy 110 165 in 2014 and 113 176 in 2015 year a middle period with a small difference doy 166 234 in 2014 and 177 238 in 2015 and a late period with a significant difference doy 235 270 in 2014 and 239 270 in 2015 there were insignificant differences in measured swcs between bm and pm during the early period without film disintegration fig 6 swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer were by about 0 9 and 0 6 lower under bm than under pm during the middle period in 2014 and 2015 respectively however they were 2 6 and 5 2 higher respectively than under nm during the late period with significant differences between bm and pm swcs decreased by 7 8 and 6 2 under bm compared to pm during 2014 and 2015 respectively while they increased by 12 5 and 15 3 respectively compared to nm these significant differences in swcs were caused by significant disintegration of the biodegradable film which disintegrated by 39 7 and 37 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively during the late period overall there were statistically significant differences in swcs between pm and bm during about 36 and 32 days of 2014 and 2015 respectively overall while there was no statistically significant difference between average swcs under bm and pm during the entire growing period they were both significantly higher than under nm the average swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer during 2 years were 0 254 0 253 and 0 245 cm3 cm 3 under pm bm and nm respectively it is apparent that mulching mainly affects swcs in the 0 20 cm soil layer fig 6 as discussed above swcs under bm were almost the same as under pm until a significant disintegration of the biodegradable film occurred there was a statistically insignificant difference between swcs under bm and pm throughout the growing period but both swcs were statistically significantly higher than under nm 3 3 simulated soil water fluxes since roots were predominantly present in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer the maximum rooting depth was about 80 cm fig 5 root water uptake occurred mainly from this soil layer and significantly affected water fluxes from to deeper soil layers the average cumulative flux positive upward at the 20 cm depth cf20 during 2014 and 2015 under bm was 1 72 times larger than under pm and 1 31 times smaller than under nm p 0 05 respectively fig 7 a and b the average cf20 was 12 43 mm higher under bm than under pm the average cumulative flux at the 80 cm depth cf80 increased 6 62 under bm compared to pm however the maximum cumulative flux of 92 3 mm occurred under nm and was 58 6 and 48 8 higher than under pm and bm respectively fig 7c and d overall the cf20 and cf80 fluxes were mainly upward representing a capillary rise from groundwater the cf20 flux accounted for 30 0 32 8 and 41 2 of the cf80 flux under pm bm and nm respectively as the biodegradable film disintegrated evaporation significantly increased fig 7e and f the average cumulative surface flux during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 for pm bm and nm were 41 0 54 9 and 106 6 mm respectively the average cumulative surface flux for bm was 33 8 higher than for pm and 48 5 lower than for nm average root water uptake in 2014 and 2015 fig 7g and h under pm and bm were not significantly different p 0 05 but increased by 5 57 and 4 19 compared to nm respectively 3 4 effects of different film mulching on soil water balance components simulated soil water balance components for the root zone 0 80 cm depth for all mulching scenarios are shown in table 3 mulching significantly affected evaporation average evaporation during 2 years for bm increased by 30 5 17 5 mm compared to pm but decreased by 41 9 53 9 mm compared to nm different types of mulching significantly decreased soil evaporation and consequently also affected i e lowered capillary rise from shallow groundwater fig 7 average capillary rise i e negative drainage for nm increased by 58 6 and 48 8 compared to pm and bm during two growing seasons table 3 however upward groundwater flux for bm was only about 6 6 higher than for pm because larger disintegration of the biodegradable film occurred only at the end of the crop growing period average upward groundwater fluxes for pm bm and nm accounted for 13 0 13 5 and 18 6 of water losses i e root water uptake and evaporation respectively while there was only a small difference in root water uptake between pm and bm there was a significant difference between nm and the other two mulching treatments the difference between the maximum pm and minimum nm root water uptake was 20 5 mm while the change in the soil water storage at the end of the season increased with the degree of the active mulching area table 3 there was only a small difference between bm and pm as a whole water balance components were not significantly different between bm and pm indicating that the biodegradable film can be used to replace the plastic film in semi arid regions e g in the hetao irrigation district 3 5 effects of irrigation and rainfall on two dimensional soil water content distributions since the effects of irrigation and rainfall on soil water distributions were similar during 2014 and 2015 only the results for 2014 will be discussed below two dimensional soil water content distributions in the root zone 0 80 cm for pm bm and nm on doy 188 i e before irrigation 190 i e one day after irrigation and 192 i e one day after rainfall of 2014 are shown in fig 8 swc profiles for different mulching scenarios are different mainly in the top 0 30 cm soil layer especially in the 0 20 cm layer fig 8 the maximum difference in swcs occurred before irrigation fig 8 when the water stress area i e locations with swcs lower than readily available water θraw 0 19 cm3 cm 3 in this study allen et al 1998 was about 304 544 and 729 cm2 for pm bm and nm respectively the water stress area was about 1 79 and 0 75 times larger for bm than for pm and nm respectively in addition θraw was reached at depths of 18 3 27 4 and 29 5 cm for pm bm and nm respectively swcs increased in the 0 20 cm soil layer 1 day after irrigation and the wetting area i e swcs equal to or larger than field capacity was 120 9 112 8 and 64 0 cm2 for pm bm and nm respectively differences in wetting areas of different scenarios were caused mainly by differences in pre irrigation saturations because rainwater could infiltrate directly into the soil in the nm scenario and at locations of film disintegration in the bm scenario the swc in these two scenarios were higher than in the pm scenario one day after rainfall i e doy 192 fig 8 the swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer three days after rainfall increased by 12 0 and 8 1 for bm compared to pm in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 6 the bm scenario can thus increase rainwater use efficiency rue compared to pm for example rue for bm improved on average by 8 2 compared to pm due to the disintegration of the film in short there was no swc deficit for bm compared to pm and nm fig 8 because of decreasing evaporation and increasing rue 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of bm on soil water the average fraction of the disintegrated biodegradable film afd reached 39 7 and 37 1 during the later stages of the crop growing season in 2014 and 2015 respectively which was much higher than for the plastic film these results are similar to those of saglam et al 2017 and explain differences in the spatial and temporal distributions of swcs between bm and pm there were no significant differences in swc profiles between bm and pm fig 6 early in the season before the biodegradable film started disintegrating significant differences onlyoccurred late in the growing season when afd reached 38 4 fig 4 swcs for bm were usually lower than for pm sun et al 2018 especially when irrigation and rainfall events did not occur 6 7 days prior khan et al 2016 in this study swcs for bm were significantly lower than for pm during some irrigation intervals fig 6 which is similar to the results of khan et al 2016 furthermore not only did bm effectively decrease evaporation losses compared to nm but it also produce higher swcs in the root zone after rainfalls during the disintegration season fig 7 h as the mulched area decreased with increasing afd during the late stages of the growing season for bm rainwater could more easily infiltrate into the soil increase swcs and effectively improve rue compared to pm which had little film disintegration saglam et al 2017 sun et al 2018 there were obvious differences in swcs between bm and pm because of bm disintegration especially in the 0 20 cm soil layer and in time periods after irrigation or rainfall figs 7 and 8 the main reason was evaporation and soil water loss from the surface soil layer the effect of mulching on swcs was usually only found in the top 0 20 cm soil layer fig 6 which was similar to the results of selim et al 2013 gao et al 2014 also indicated that significant differences in swcs occurred only in the top 0 20 cm soil layer between mulching and no mulching locations and that mulching could increase swcs by 15 compared to no mulching as discussed above differences in the active not disintegrated mulching area of the biodegradable film caused different swc distributions in the soil profile similarly as in saglam et al 2017 the averaged measured fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film afd at the very last day of the season was 54 4 while the low and high afd values were either lower or higher by 30 compared to the mean afd value the swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer of the bm treatment with low afd was almost the same as for the pm treatment fig 9 however swcs for the bm treatment under the medium and high afd decreased by 3 5 and 6 3 compared to pm respectively the swc decreased linearly with increasing afd y 0 0071x 0 2616 in the late crop growth period swcs for low medium and high afd were lower by 6 5 100 and 13 5 than for pm respectively fig 9 4 2 evaluation of cumulative soil water fluxes the extent of mulching has a negative relationship with evaporation fig 7 i e evaporation from the bm system is higher than from the pm system and the nm system has significantly higher evaporation than the mulching scenarios bm and pm han et al 2015 soil water losses are reduced by mulching especially in semi arid regions with intensive evaporation zhang et al 2018 in addition different irrigation patterns and mulching materials also affect soil evaporation for example evaporation from soils with large frequent irrigations is smaller than from soils with small frequent irrigations he et al 2018 in addition dlamini et al 2017 found that in semiarid areas mulching with sand similarly as with pm and bm can also significantly reduce evaporation in comparison to no mulching table 3 corn roots about 66 70 were mainly distributed in the shallow soil layer 0 30 cm which was the main crop root water uptake layer li et al 2017 this layer can be easily affected by evaporation irrigation and rainfall he et al 2018 reported that seasonal corn root water uptake ranged from 348 to 394 mm under different soil water conditions which was similar to this study table 4 due to the shallow groundwater table in the hetao irrigation district groundwater contributed significantly to crop root water uptake e g forkutsa et al 2009 liu et al 2016 ayars et al 2006 forkutsa et al 2009 indicated that about 79 106 mm of crop root water uptake came from groundwater under the sandy loam soil liu et al 2016 indicated that the groundwater contribution reached about 20 40 of crop water consumption ayars et al 2006 reported that groundwater contributed about 0 29 in the silt loam soil while in this study it only contributed about 13 19 the upward groundwater flux and evaporation were directly related to afd table 4 the groundwater flux for bm under high afd was 70 8 mm which was 1 32 and 1 27 times higher than under low and medium afd respectively evaporation under high afd increased by 30 1 and 17 7 mm compared to under low and medium afd respectively the groundwater flux and evaporation increased by 1 05 mm and 2 46 mm respectively when 1 cm2 of plastic film disintegrated the contribution of groundwater increased with afd according to y 0 16x 24 43 where x is afd in cm2 and y is the groundwater uptake amount in mm however root water uptake was only slightly affected by afd root water uptake values decreased only slightly from low to medium and high afds the maximum difference in cumulative root water uptake was reached between low and high afd and was only 8 5 mm 5 conclusions numerical modeling based on hydrus 2d was used in this study to evaluate the effects of bm on swcs and water fluxes the model was first calibrated and validated using experimental data from two seasons of 2014 and 2015 in general there was good agreement between the results of numerical simulations and measurements the benefits of bm were similar to those of pm both mulching scenarios bm and pm functioned similarly during the early growing season before film disintegration significant differences occurred only in the late growing season when afd was equal to or higher than 38 4 additionally differences in swcs were only found in the top 0 20 cm soil layer average cumulative evaporation and average cumulative fluxes at depths of 20 and 80 cm were significantly different for different mulching scenarios increasing from pm to bm and further to nm p 0 05 two dimensional soil water content distributions showed that before irrigation the water stress area in the surface soil layer of the bm soil was larger than in the pm soil and significantly lower than in the nm soil swcs in the root zone after rainfall would increase in the bm system during the disintegration season and effectively improve rue the effects of film disintegration on swcs and water fluxes were effectively simulated using hydrus 2d bm is recommended as a viable option

10831, efficient use of irrigation is essential for minimising environmental impacts of agriculture particularly on stony soils which are vulnerable to nitrogen leaching models of soil water balance

depth for irrigated and non irrigated lucerne medicago sativa l on stony alluvial soils in central south island new zealand modelled estimates were compared against measurements of evaporation by eddy covariance profile soil water content from soil moisture sensors and drainage from lysimeters from 1 october 2016 to 1 july 2018 at each site cumulative evaporation and drainage were within 4 of measurements and short term variations were well predicted for non irrigated lucerne under irrigation modelled cumulative evaporation and drainage overestimated measurements by 6 and 24 respectively this overestimation must be viewed within the context of uncertainties related to the measurements particularly given non closure of the measured water balance related to spatial variability and inherent biases in the measurement methods model inputs and concept are likewise sources of uncertainty total water content predicted for the 1 5 m depth soil profile was 40 50 greater than the measured volume for both non irrigated and irrigated lucerne although short term variations were well predicted suggesting that further research is needed on estimation of soil hydraulic parameters which represent water storage in these stony alluvial soils our results highlight the value of well measured sites such as those of the current study for evaluating the quality of soil hydrological

demand for agricultural production is leading to intensification of management practices and improving efficiency of these practices is necessary to minimise the environmental impacts tilman et al

evaporation e and drainage d the balance of which yields storage in the soil s precipitation is measured widely while measurements of d e and s are less frequent and must be estimated from models potential e can be estimated from climatology under the assumption that soil water is not limiting allen et al 1998 penman 1948 however in most situations e is dependent on supply from soil water which further depends on the physical properties of the soil as well as d models of soil water balance range from simple one layer bucket models with limited representation of soil and water uptake by roots porteous et al 1994 woodward et al 2001 to more complex process oriented soil representations based on the richards equation for unsaturated flow šimůnek et al 2005 vogeler and cichota 2018 the most complex of these are capable of representing heterogeneous flow resulting from macropores and rock fragments brown et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2003 more complex models however require a large number of parameters which must be estimated from field and laboratory observations or more commonly predicted by pedotransfer functions from readily measured soil properties such as bulk density particle size distribution field capacity wilting point and organic matter content cichota et al 2013 schaap et al 2001 in the current study we have applied the soil water flow model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al

state s of the model can be tested simultaneously against independent field measured datasets graham et al 2018 we use the model predictions to both explain imbalances in the field data related to spatial variability and assumptions of the measurement methods as well as test the effects of parameter selection on model performance this rigorous evaluation of modelled d e and s will inform the

the driving variables to gap fill evaporation were net radiation vapour pressure deficit and wind speed beginning in late september spring 2016 soil drainage d at 1 5 m soil depth was measured by six large area 3 14 m2 drainage lysimeters at each site within the same field as the eddy covariance towers lysimeters were constructed in situ from undisturbed columns of soil enclosed by a 2 m diameter high density polyethylene cylinder sealed to a perforated base plate through which water could drain freely into a collection pan all drainage was routed past tipping spoons tip counts from which were logged continuously to a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa additional details on lysimeter design and installation can be found in carrick et al 2017 lysimeters were planted with lucerne and managed to replicate harvest and grazing events of the entire field total water content of the 1 5 m soil profile s was estimated from three profiles of soil moisture sensors cs650 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed adjacent to the lysimeter area each profile consisted of measurements at six depths 0 1 0 25 0 4 0 55 1 0 and 1 5 m the soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally into their respective soil layer and were calibrated for the presence of stones in the profile known to impact dielectric properties of the soil and thus estimation of soil water content calibration was carried out in lysimeters with known stone contents and a soil texture similar to that of the current study in which volumetric water contents were measured both by sensors and from periodic soil samples h e brown plant and food research lincoln new zealand unpublished linear relationships were established between sensor measurements and soil sample based water contents at 0 30 and 50 stone contents and the slope and intercepts coefficients were interpolated to the range of stone contents observed at the field sites validity of these corrections was tested with data on soil water content collected during characterization of the soil profile volumetric water contents from the soil moisture sensors were applied to their respective soil layer in order to calculate integrated water content of the 1 5 m soil profile s o 2 3 hydrus 1d the soil water flow model hydrus 1d was used to simulate daily estimates of d e and s šimůnek et al 2005 hydrus 1d implements the richards equation for unsaturated water flow using the hydraulic model of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 with the water retention function defined by 1 θ e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m where θ e is the effective saturation at pressure head h θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water contents α is the inverse air entry value and m and n are additional shape parameters with m 1 1 n the hydraulic conductivity function is defined by 2 k θ e k s θ e l 1 1 θ e 1 m m 2 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is the tortuosity the parameter values for k s θ r θ s α and n were derived for 8 soil layers based on measured sand silt and clay fractions and bulk density for fine soil 2 mm using the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 the value of l was fixed to 0 5 due to the large volume of stones in the soil profile it was necessary to correct the values of k s θ r and θ s in order to produce values of profile water content and conductivity which reflect the volume of soil contributing to these processes the parameters table 2 were reduced by a multiplier value of 1 v where v is the volumetric stone fraction thus treating the stones as voids which do not contribute to water retention or conductivity an approach utilised for similar soils with high gravel content dann et al 2009 the upper boundary condition of the model consists of measured water input i and an estimate of potential e by the fao 56 penman monteith reference method allen et al 1998 calculated from measured values of incoming solar radiation wind speed and daily maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity potential soil evaporation and transpiration are partitioned according to estimates of leaf area index interpolated linearly between monthly sampling dates and an extinction coefficient of 0 7 similar to that estimated for the summer growth period of lucerne sim et al 2017 root water uptake is simulated according to the model of feddes 1978 with parameters for lucerne from taylor and ashcroft 1972 a compensated model of root water uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 was used with the critical stress value for water uptake by lucerne set to 0 4 sadras and milroy 1996 simulated root distribution was scaled to reflect full spatial exploitation for the upper 0 3 m then declining linearly to 0 at 1 5 m the lower boundary condition was dependent on the variable of interest d e or s annual water balance from the lysimeters soil moisture sensors and eddy covariance system in irrigated alfalfa indicated an imbalance where water was apparently accumulating in the soil profile however this was not supported by soil moisture sensors laubach et al 2019 this was attributed in part to the hydraulic separation of the lysimeter from the subsoil resulting in less drainage than would occur in the surrounding freely draining soil thus when predicting d the lower boundary was set as a seepage face as is recommended for lysimeter systems and best represents this hydraulic discontinuity šimůnek et al 2005 when predicting e and s the lower boundary was simulated as free drainage as these measurements were not subject to the hydraulic separation and free drainage best represents the field condition this decision was supported by comparison of the measured volumetric water content with model predictions for both a seepage face and free drainage boundary fig 1 and 2 the initial condition of the soil profile was set to field capacity determined according to twarakavi et al 2009 hydrus 1d was run for the time period 28 september spring 2015 to 1 july winter 2018 the period prior to lysimeter and soil sensor installation was treated as a spin up period and only data from 1 october 2016 to 1 july 2018 when all instruments were running were used for model validation minimising the impact of initial condition selection on modelled results 2 4 data analyses performance of the simulation over the validation period was assessed by comparing cumulative totals of modelled d and e and mean s d m e m and s m with observed d e and s d o e o and s o nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse root mean squared error rmse and linear regression statistics slope offset and r 2 were calculated for daily predictions of each variable simulations of d were further analysed for number and timing of peaks in the drainage time series identifying instances when peaks in d m and d o occurred on the same day cross correlation analysis was used to identify lags between d o and d m correlation r was calculated for lag times of up to 10 days all analyses were performed in r 3 3 3 r core team 2017 2 5 sensitivity testing for each site the set of values used to parameterise soil hydraulic behaviour and root water uptake within the model were estimated from pedotransfer function in the case of soil hydraulic parameters and literature values in the case of crop parameters including the critical stress value for root water uptake and the light extinction coefficient which regulates energy partitioning between the plant and soil to assess potential uncertainties associated with the selection of these parameter values several test scenarios with different parameter sets were generated and the sensitivity of d e and s to each parameterization was evaluated these test scenarios included 1 the use of soil hydraulic parameters predicted for the opposing site non irrigated vs irrigated in order to represent the impact of farm scale variation in soil hydraulic properties 2 use of a critical stress value for root water uptake of 0 2 3 use of a critical stress value of 0 6 4 an uncompensated root water uptake model 5 use of the hydrus default light extinction coefficient of 0 46 and 6 use of a seasonally high value of light extinction estimated for lucerne of 0 9 sim et al 2017 hereafter the critical stress value and light extinction coefficient will be referred to as crop parameters 3 results 3 1 evaporation variations of e o were well simulated by e m and model performance metrics indicate a nse of 0 75 and linearity between modelled and measured values table 3 fig 3 overestimation of e o occurred regularly late autumn 2017 through spring 2017 march october fig 4 when e o was typically low while underestimation of e o by e m occurred more frequently between october 2017 and april 2018 cumulative e m over the 21 month validation period was 974 mm for non irrigated lucerne within 3 of cumulative e o estimated from eddy covariance table 3 simulations of e m were insensitive to changes in crop parameters table s1 however cumulative e m decreased by 5 when using soil hydraulic parameters predicted from the soil description of the irrigated site resulting in further underestimation of e o varying the critical stress threshold for root water uptake had negligible impact on e m with a 1 5 decrease occurring only under the condition of uncompensated root water uptake similarly varying the light extinction coefficient resulted in a 1 change in cumulative e m and little change in other performance metrics for irrigated lucerne cumulative e m was 1233 mm over the validation period 6 greater than e o table 3 the largest differences occurred between autumn march and spring october 2017 when daily e m overestimated e o contributing substantially to the cumulative difference fig 2 nse for the simulation was 0 81 and there was linearity between e o and e m fig 1 as with the non irrigated site e m was relatively insensitive to changes in crop and soil parameters soil hydraulic parameters predicted from the soil profile of the non irrigated site decreased cumulative e m at the irrigated site by only 1 while uncompensated root uptake reduced e m by 1 6 all other parameter sets showed negligible difference to those used in the original model 3 2 soil water content for non irrigated lucerne s o from soil moisture sensors was overestimated by s m throughout the validation period table 3 the difference between s o and s m at the non irrigated site was primarily the result of volumetric water content in the upper 0 4 m of soil fig 1 predicted storage in these upper layers was nearly double the measured value and this overestimation resulted in negative nse for s m indicating unsatisfactory performance of the model however there was linearity between measurement and model values r 2 0 86 likewise predictions of daily change in soil water storage δs were generally reasonable and in fact underestimated on average despite overestimation of the total water content table 3 cumulative δs m over the validation period was 32 mm compared to δs o of 42 mm in contrast to e m s m was more sensitive to changes in model parameters hydraulic parameters predicted from the irrigated lucerne soil description reduced mean s m by 27 improving agreement with s o table s1 changes to crop parameters however resulted in changes 3 to mean s m with minimal effect on model performance statistics for irrigated lucerne mean s m overestimated s o by 40 resulting in low model performance statistics table 3 as with non irrigated lucerne the difference between s o and s m was driven by predictions for the topsoil where volumetric water content was overestimated and seasonal variation underestimated fig 2 as with the non irrigated site there was a good linear relationship between s o and s m r 2 0 72 and δs m was reasonably well predicted table 3 cumulative δs m over the validation period was 33 mm compared to δs o of 46 mm varying soil parameters resulted in a 37 increase in mean s m decreasing model performance whereas changes to crop parameters had minimal impact on s m less than 2 3 3 soil drainage simulated drainage at 1 5 m depth d m was 382 mm over the validation period for non irrigated lucerne within 3 of d o from six lysimeters and well within the range of measured values table 3 the start of drainage was delayed relative to d o and d m generally underestimated d o throughout the first drainage season april through october 2017 figs 2 and 5 two moderate drainage events which occurred in summer january and february 2018 were not predicted by the model while events from april 2018 onward were overestimated by d m twenty three peaks were identified in d o over the validation period while 20 were simulated by d m although just four of which occurred on the same day as peaks in d o cross correlation analysis indicated a lag of 1 day in d m relative to d o r 0 85 although weaker but still significant lag correlations were also observed at lag times of up to10 days for non irrigated lucerne the effect of using hydraulic parameters from the irrigated site increased drainage by 16 and correspondingly decreased model performance statistics table s1 varying the critical stress threshold from 0 2 to 0 6 had little impact on either cumulative d m or model performance statistics although an uncompensated root uptake model increased cumulative d m to within 0 5 of d o altering the partitioning of energy within the canopy by changing the light extinction coefficient had an effect of 3 on cumulative drainage but again had little impact on other model performance statistics for irrigated lucerne cumulative d m was 815 mm 24 greater than the value for d o table 3 d o was generally well simulated by d m during the first drainage season correctly predicting the start of drainage following a dry summer d m exceeded d o through winter may august 2017 and underestimated d o in spring and early summer figs 2 and 5 from january to july 2018 d o was overestimated by d m to a larger degree resulting in the cumulative difference under irrigation 42 peaks were identified in the d o time series thirty six peaks were identified in d m with 10 exact matches in peak timing with the d o time series the strongest correlation between d o and d m was observed at 0 days r 0 81 although there was strong lag correlation at 1 day r 0 76 and significant lags of lower correlations at 2 3 days under irrigation d m was relatively insensitive to parameter changes with all tested parameter sets within 1 of the original value the drainage results reported so far were obtained with the seepage face boundary condition aiming for best match of model and observations prescribing a free drainage boundary condition instead we obtained drainage of 457 mm at the non irrigated and 872 mm at the irrigated site an increase of 19 and 7 respectively over simulations using the seepage face boundary 4 discussion here we have applied the soil water flow model hydrus 1d parameterised with a detailed description of soil texture bulk density and stone content in combination with a widely used pedotransfer function to simulate components of water balance of stony alluvial soils planted with lucerne boundary conditions of the model were varied to best represent the measured conditions with the objective of explaining observed imbalances in the field measurements of water inputs and outputs performance of simulations varied by the component predicted d e or s irrigation management irrigated vs non irrigated as well as seasonally under non irrigated conditions cumulative d m and e m were within 4 and 3 of observed quantities respectively these results support previous findings within new zealand that d is relatively well simulated by models with hydraulic parameters derived from pedotransfer function for a range of soil types cichota et al 2013 likewise e m from penman monteith based approaches similar to that employed in hydrus 1d have performed well against e o from eddy covariance in other new zealand forage systems graham et al 2016 pronger et al 2016 our results provide further support for the use of models such as hydrus 1d for quantifying hydrological fluxes in rain fed forage systems without further site specific calibration for soil types with free draining subsoils however mean s m for the 1 5 m soil profile depth was on average 50 greater than that observed by soil moisture sensors suggesting that while fluxes of water can be well simulated the pedotransfer based approach employed here is not adequate for representing water storage within these stony alluvial soils despite overestimation of total water storage both seasonality of so and daily δso were reproduced well by the model under irrigated lucerne d m and e m overestimated observed cumulative totals by 24 and 6 respectively previous studies have shown that d o can be overestimated by d m under high water inputs however this effect is not systematic across soil types cichota et al 2013 wegehenkel and beyrich 2014 similarly noted a 20 overestimate of e o by e m from hydrus 1d for temperate grassland when compared to estimates from eddy covariance during wet periods these findings suggest that hydrological predictions for irrigated environments should be applied with caution the apparent errors in estimation of e m and d m for irrigated lucerne and s m under both management conditions must however be interpreted with respect to potential uncertainties in the measurement methods and spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem of immediate note is that field estimates of d e and δs amount to only 87 of measured water input a scenario which cannot be replicated by a single one dimensional model such imbalances have occurred at other sites where d e and s have been independently observed in the field graham et al 2018 measurement artefacts inherent to the lysimeter design are hypothesized to contribute to discrepancies in the observed water balance for irrigated lucerne laubach et al 2019 isolation of soil within the lysimeter removes tension normally exerted under conditions of pore connectivity application of tension to lysimeters similar to that exerted by the subsoil is known to increase drainage volumes zhu et al 2002 therefore when simulating d the lower boundary condition of hydrus 1d was here defined as a seepage face to best replicate the conditions of the lysimeter by contrast when modelling d at the scale measured by eddy covariance 100 200 m fetch a free drainage boundary condition should be employed while use of a seepage face boundary condition did produce the hypothesized effect of reducing drainage relative to a free drainage boundary modelled balances only show a discrepancy of 2 5 at the irrigated site in contrast to the 13 discrepancy in measurements suggesting there may be other factors involved in non closure of the water balance variability in measurements of rainfall and irrigation may likewise contribute to this apparent imbalance estimates of i for each site were a composite of measurements from two 150 mm diameter rain gauges despite being within 250 m distance of each other the individual rain gauges indicated a consistent 10 difference in recorded volume this was the case for paired gauges at both the irrigated and non irrigated sites this difference may reflect the inherent spatial variability of rainfall and irrigation however the systematic nature of this difference and its presence at both irrigated and non irrigated sites favours an explanation related to instrument error underestimation of turbulent energy exchange by the eddy covariance method has been reported widely in the literature leuning et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 thus a bias in e o may have contributed to the observed imbalance between observed water inputs and outputs as well as deviation from e m at both the irrigated and non irrigated site energy balance closure as evaluated by the slope of the relationship between available energy and turbulent exchanges was 90 however there was a distinct seasonality whereby the energy balance was nearly closed during spring and summer months october march when daily e was high and non closure occurred over autumn and winter months april september this finding is consistent with the observed cumulative difference between e m and e o which occurred between april and october 2017 unexplained bias resulting from imperfect energy balance closure may have contributed to both the imbalance in field measurements and differences between e m and e o although energy balance closure and its seasonality were similar for the two sites and does not account for the large difference in apparent model performance for irrigated versus non irrigated lucerne variations between observed and modelled d e and s may also be due to selection of hydraulic parameters as well as model concept selection of hydraulic parameters and corrections applied to account for stones likely influenced modelling outcomes hydraulic parameters were derived from a commonly used pedotransfer function rosetta based on texture and bulk density of the fine soil 2 mm values of k s θ r and θ s were then corrected treating stones as voids which do not contribute to storage or conductivity an approach which has been used for similar soils within the region as well as internationally dann et al 2009 mcneill et al 2018 previous studies suggest that the mean behaviour of so can be represented by s m using such parameterisation methods coppola et al 2013 ma et al 2010 on the other hand provide experimental evidence that stones do not behave as impermeable voids and the impact of stone content on hydraulic properties is non linear the performance of different pedotransfer functions likewise varies considerably for predicting water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity of contrasting new zealand thus an approach employing an ensemble of pedotransfer functions may yield improve modelled results cichota et al 2013 mcneill et al 2018 sensitivity testing in the present study indicates that farm scale spatial variability in soil properties can contribute to variations of up to 37 in s m while d m and e m fluctuate by up to 16 and 5 respectively by contrast crop parameters which determine root water uptake and partitioning of energy amongst evaporation and transpiration had relatively little impact on any of the modelled values it is clear that more attention is required for predicting hydraulic parameters to improve the accuracy of s m for these stony soils a single porosity hydraulic model was used in simulating water fluxes and storage however the stony soils at our study site are known to be prone to preferential flow carrick et al 2014 2013 carrick et al 2017 mcleod et al 2014 previous studies in the region have required a dual porosity approach to better represent water flow through stony soils brown et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 pollacco et al 2017 in the present study although drainage peaks were generally well resolved there was a significant lag in d m relative to d o observed at both sites this is likely a result of overestimation of water storage in the soil but may also be due to the inability of the single porosity concept to simulate enhanced conductivity through macropores inverse modelling approaches have been shown to estimate conductivity values which exceed those from pedotransfer function for these soils graham et al 2018 however when coupled with a single porosity approach the inversely derived parameters continue to produce a lag between d o and d m albeit reduced from pedotransfer derived parameter sets suggesting that a single porosity concept is insufficient to fully capture dynamics of drainage resulting from heterogeneous flow through preferential flow pathways considering uncertainties related to a simplified single matrix soil concept potential errors introduced by pedotransfer derived soil parameters errors in the model input data and imbalances in the observed water balance hydrus 1d predicted partitioning of water fluxes amongst d and e which was well matched to observations at both sites observed ratios of d o e o were 0 37 and 0 56 for non irrigated and irrigated sites respectively while the ratios d m e m for the same sites were 0 39 and 0 66 respectively the relative insensitivity of both d m and e m to crop and soil parameters under irrigation indicates overriding importance of water inputs and climatology in driving accumulations and temporal variability of d and e under conditions of lower water input at the non irrigated site crop and soil parameters are more important particularly for predicting d 5 conclusions cumulative volumes seasonality and short term variations in d and e were well simulated by hydrus 1d parameterised using a pedotransfer based approach for non irrigated lucerne grown on stony alluvial soils however water storage in the 1 5 m soil profile was overestimated by s m under irrigation d e and s were each overestimated by hydrus 1d while these results initially suggest that irrigation impacts the quality of modelling outcomes and caution should be used when interpreting simulations for such management practices these findings must be viewed considering uncertainties of both modelled and measured values related to spatial heterogeneity of the system methodological artefacts model concept input data and parameterisation method we find that temporal variability and partitioning of water fluxes to d and e are driven primarily by water inputs and climatology thus predictions are relatively insensitive to model structure and parameterisation however under non irrigated conditions soil hydraulic parameters become more important for simulating dynamics of d in general the greatest gains to modelling skill would result from improved pedotransfer based

10831, efficient use of irrigation is essential for minimising environmental impacts of agriculture particularly on stony soils which are vulnerable to nitrogen leaching models of soil water balance are essential tools for effective agricultural water management here we use the soil water flow model hydrus 1d to predict evaporation total 1 5 m soil profile water content and drainage at 1 5 m soil depth for irrigated and non irrigated lucerne medicago sativa l on stony alluvial soils in central south island new zealand modelled estimates were compared against measurements of evaporation by eddy covariance profile soil water content from soil moisture sensors and drainage from lysimeters from 1 october 2016 to 1 july 2018 at each site cumulative evaporation and drainage were within 4 of measurements and short term variations were well predicted for non irrigated lucerne under irrigation modelled cumulative evaporation and drainage overestimated measurements by 6 and 24 respectively this overestimation must be viewed within the context of uncertainties related to the measurements particularly given non closure of the measured water balance related to spatial variability and inherent biases in the measurement methods model inputs and concept are likewise sources of uncertainty total water content predicted for the 1 5 m depth soil profile was 40 50 greater than the measured volume for both non irrigated and irrigated lucerne although short term variations were well predicted suggesting that further research is needed on estimation of soil hydraulic parameters which represent water storage in these stony alluvial soils our results highlight the value of well measured sites such as those of the current study for evaluating the quality of soil hydrological predictions keywords soil hydrology evaporation drainage lysimeter eddy covariance alfalfa 1 introduction accurate prediction of soil water balance and its component inputs and outputs under a range of agricultural conditions is essential for freshwater resource management drainage from the root zone not only contributes to recharge of groundwater but is a pathway for contaminant transport thus impacting both water quantity and quality while transpiration and evaporation from soil and intercepted water are important demands for irrigation this study evaluates predictions of drainage total soil profile water content and evaporative water use by the soil water flow model hydrus 1d for both irrigated and non irrigated lucerne alfalfa medicago sativa l grown on stony alluvial soils global demand for agricultural production is leading to intensification of management practices and improving efficiency of these practices is necessary to minimise the environmental impacts tilman et al 2011 irrigation in particular has enhanced agricultural production globally siebert and döll 2010 however depending on management irrigation can increase soil drainage volumes duncan et al 2016 and contribute to transport of a range of contaminants to groundwater carrick et al 2014 cichota et al 2016 di and cameron 2002 gray et al 2016 weaver et al 2016 within new zealand irrigated land area has increased to 800 000 ha largely to support expansion and intensification of the dairy industry ministry for the environment and statistics new zealand 2018 this increase is most marked in the canterbury plains region of the south island annual rates of nitrate leaching for the canterbury region are estimated to have doubled between 1990 and 2010 dymond et al 2013 and irrigation of extensive areas of stony alluvial soils poses further risk to surface and groundwater quality unless water and fertiliser inputs are carefully managed carrick et al 2013 increasingly alternative deep

sanderson et al 2005 or as monoculture brown et al 2005 to enhance production and use of deeper soil water sources lucerne has roots which extend below 2 m depth and extraction of deep soil water allows for continued production through seasonal droughts brown et al 2005 evans 1978 simplified one dimensional water balance consists of inputs from precipitation or irrigation and outputs from evaporation e and drainage d the balance of which yields storage in the soil s precipitation is measured widely while measurements of d e and s are less frequent and must be estimated from models potential e can be estimated from climatology under the assumption that soil water is not limiting allen et al 1998 penman 1948 however in most situations e is dependent on supply from soil water which further depends on the physical properties of the soil as well as d models of soil water balance range from simple one layer bucket models with limited representation of soil and water uptake by roots porteous et al 1994 woodward et al 2001 to more complex process oriented soil representations based on the richards equation for unsaturated flow šimůnek et al 2005 vogeler and cichota 2018 the most complex of these are capable of representing heterogeneous flow resulting from macropores and rock fragments brown et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2003 more complex models however require a large number of parameters which must be estimated from field and laboratory observations or more commonly predicted by pedotransfer functions from readily measured soil properties such as bulk density particle size distribution field capacity wilting point and organic matter content cichota et al 2013 schaap et al 2001 in the current study we have applied the soil water flow model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2005 to predict components of soil water balance in lucerne grown for forage under both non irrigated and irrigated conditions simulations of evaporation e profile soil water content s and drainage d are compared to measurements of evaporation including transpiration and evaporation of soil and intercepted water by eddy covariance soil water content by soil moisture sensor and drainage from lysimeters which are described in detail by laubach et al 2019 although we present a well used modelling approach few sites exist where predictions of both the boundary fluxes d and e and internal state s of the model can be tested simultaneously against independent field measured datasets graham et al 2018 we use the model predictions to both explain imbalances in the field data related to spatial variability and assumptions of the measurement methods as well as test the effects of parameter selection on model performance this rigorous evaluation of modelled d e and s will inform the use of soil hydrological models for simulating soil water balance in stony alluvial soils an essential step towards predicting and informing management actions to help minimise leaching of nitrogen

the driving variables to gap fill evaporation were net radiation vapour pressure deficit and wind speed beginning in late september spring 2016 soil drainage d at 1 5 m soil depth was measured by six large area 3 14 m2 drainage lysimeters at each site within the same field as the eddy covariance towers lysimeters were constructed in situ from undisturbed columns of soil enclosed by a 2 m diameter high density polyethylene cylinder sealed to a perforated base plate through which water could drain freely into a collection pan all drainage was routed past tipping spoons tip counts from which were logged continuously to a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa additional details on lysimeter design and installation can be found in carrick et al 2017 lysimeters were planted with lucerne and managed to replicate harvest and grazing events of the entire field total water content of the 1 5 m soil profile s was estimated from three profiles of soil moisture sensors cs650 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed adjacent to the lysimeter area each profile consisted of measurements at six depths 0 1 0 25 0 4 0 55 1 0 and 1 5 m the soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally into their respective soil layer and were calibrated for the presence of stones in the profile known to impact dielectric properties of the soil and thus estimation of soil water content calibration was carried out in lysimeters with known stone contents and a soil texture similar to that of the current study in which volumetric water contents were measured both by sensors and from periodic soil samples h e brown plant and food research lincoln new zealand unpublished linear relationships were established between sensor measurements and soil sample based water contents at 0 30 and 50 stone contents and the slope and intercepts coefficients were interpolated to the range of stone contents observed at the field sites validity of these corrections was tested with data on soil water content collected during characterization of the soil profile volumetric water contents from the soil moisture sensors were applied to their respective soil layer in order to calculate integrated water content of the 1 5 m soil profile s o 2 3 hydrus 1d the soil water flow model hydrus 1d was used to simulate daily estimates of d e and s šimůnek et al 2005 hydrus 1d implements the richards equation for unsaturated water flow using the hydraulic model of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 with the water retention function defined by 1 θ e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m where θ e is the effective saturation at pressure head h θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water contents α is the inverse air entry value and m and n are additional shape parameters with m 1 1 n the hydraulic conductivity function is defined by 2 k θ e k s θ e l 1 1 θ e 1 m m 2 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is the tortuosity the parameter values for k s θ r θ s α and n were derived for 8 soil layers based on measured sand silt and clay fractions and bulk density for fine soil 2 mm using the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 the value of l was fixed to 0 5 due to the large volume of stones in the soil profile it was necessary to correct the values of k s θ r and θ s in order to produce values of profile water content and conductivity which reflect the volume of soil contributing to these processes the parameters table 2 were reduced by a multiplier value of 1 v where v is the volumetric stone fraction thus treating the stones as voids which do not contribute to water retention or conductivity an approach utilised for similar soils with high gravel content dann et al 2009 the upper boundary condition of the model consists of measured water input i and an estimate of potential e by the fao 56 penman monteith reference method allen et al 1998 calculated from measured values of incoming solar radiation wind speed and daily maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity potential soil evaporation and transpiration are partitioned according to estimates of leaf area index interpolated linearly between monthly sampling dates and an extinction coefficient of 0 7 similar to that estimated for the summer growth period of lucerne sim et al 2017 root water uptake is simulated according to the model of feddes 1978 with parameters for lucerne from taylor and ashcroft 1972 a compensated model of root water uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 was used with the critical stress value for water uptake by lucerne set to 0 4 sadras and milroy 1996 simulated root distribution was scaled to reflect full spatial exploitation for the upper 0 3 m then declining linearly to 0 at 1 5 m the lower boundary condition was dependent on the variable of interest d e or s annual water balance from the lysimeters soil moisture sensors and eddy covariance system in irrigated alfalfa indicated an imbalance where water was apparently accumulating in the soil profile however this was not supported by soil moisture sensors laubach et al 2019 this was attributed in part to the hydraulic separation of the lysimeter from the subsoil resulting in less drainage than would occur in the surrounding freely draining soil thus when predicting d the lower boundary was set as a seepage face as is recommended for lysimeter systems and best represents this hydraulic discontinuity šimůnek et al 2005 when predicting e and s the lower boundary was simulated as free drainage as these measurements were not subject to the hydraulic separation and free drainage best represents the field condition this decision was supported by comparison of the measured volumetric water content with model predictions for both a seepage face and free drainage boundary fig 1 and 2 the initial condition of the soil profile was set to field capacity determined according to twarakavi et al 2009 hydrus 1d was run for the time period 28 september spring 2015 to 1 july winter 2018 the period prior to lysimeter and soil sensor installation was treated as a spin up period and only data from 1 october 2016 to 1 july 2018 when all instruments were running were used for model validation minimising the impact of initial condition selection on modelled results 2 4 data analyses performance of the simulation over the validation period was assessed by comparing cumulative totals of modelled d and e and mean s d m e m and s m with observed d e and s d o e o and s o nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse root mean squared error rmse and linear regression statistics slope offset and r 2 were calculated for daily predictions of each variable simulations of d were further analysed for number and timing of peaks in the drainage time series identifying instances when peaks in d m and d o occurred on the same day cross correlation analysis was used to identify lags between d o and d m correlation r was calculated for lag times of up to 10 days all analyses were performed in r 3 3 3 r core team 2017 2 5 sensitivity testing for each site the set of values used to parameterise soil hydraulic behaviour and root water uptake within the model were estimated from pedotransfer function in the case of soil hydraulic parameters and literature values in the case of crop parameters including the critical stress value for root water uptake and the light extinction coefficient which regulates energy partitioning between the plant and soil to assess potential uncertainties associated with the selection of these parameter values several test scenarios with different parameter sets were generated and the sensitivity of d e and s to each parameterization was evaluated these test scenarios included 1 the use of soil hydraulic parameters predicted for the opposing site non irrigated vs irrigated in order to represent the impact of farm scale variation in soil hydraulic properties 2 use of a critical stress value for root water uptake of 0 2 3 use of a critical stress value of 0 6 4 an uncompensated root water uptake model 5 use of the hydrus default light extinction coefficient of 0 46 and 6 use of a seasonally high value of light extinction estimated for lucerne of 0 9 sim et al 2017 hereafter the critical stress value and light extinction coefficient will be referred to as crop parameters 3 results 3 1 evaporation variations of e o were well simulated by e m and model performance metrics indicate a nse of 0 75 and linearity between modelled and measured values table 3 fig 3 overestimation of e o occurred regularly late autumn 2017 through spring 2017 march october fig 4 when e o was typically low while underestimation of e o by e m occurred more frequently between october 2017 and april 2018 cumulative e m over the 21 month validation period was 974 mm for non irrigated lucerne within 3 of cumulative e o estimated from eddy covariance table 3 simulations of e m were insensitive to changes in crop parameters table s1 however cumulative e m decreased by 5 when using soil hydraulic parameters predicted from the soil description of the irrigated site resulting in further underestimation of e o varying the critical stress threshold for root water uptake had negligible impact on e m with a 1 5 decrease occurring only under the condition of uncompensated root water uptake similarly varying the light extinction coefficient resulted in a 1 change in cumulative e m and little change in other performance metrics for irrigated lucerne cumulative e m was 1233 mm over the validation period 6 greater than e o table 3 the largest differences occurred between autumn march and spring october 2017 when daily e m overestimated e o contributing substantially to the cumulative difference fig 2 nse for the simulation was 0 81 and there was linearity between e o and e m fig 1 as with the non irrigated site e m was relatively insensitive to changes in crop and soil parameters soil hydraulic parameters predicted from the soil profile of the non irrigated site decreased cumulative e m at the irrigated site by only 1 while uncompensated root uptake reduced e m by 1 6 all other parameter sets showed negligible difference to those used in the original model 3 2 soil water content for non irrigated lucerne s o from soil moisture sensors was overestimated by s m throughout the validation period table 3 the difference between s o and s m at the non irrigated site was primarily the result of volumetric water content in the upper 0 4 m of soil fig 1 predicted storage in these upper layers was nearly double the measured value and this overestimation resulted in negative nse for s m indicating unsatisfactory performance of the model however there was linearity between measurement and model values r 2 0 86 likewise predictions of daily change in soil water storage δs were generally reasonable and in fact underestimated on average despite overestimation of the total water content table 3 cumulative δs m over the validation period was 32 mm compared to δs o of 42 mm in contrast to e m s m was more sensitive to changes in model parameters hydraulic parameters predicted from the irrigated lucerne soil description reduced mean s m by 27 improving agreement with s o table s1 changes to crop parameters however resulted in changes 3 to mean s m with minimal effect on model performance statistics for irrigated lucerne mean s m overestimated s o by 40 resulting in low model performance statistics table 3 as with non irrigated lucerne the difference between s o and s m was driven by predictions for the topsoil where volumetric water content was overestimated and seasonal variation underestimated fig 2 as with the non irrigated site there was a good linear relationship between s o and s m r 2 0 72 and δs m was reasonably well predicted table 3 cumulative δs m over the validation period was 33 mm compared to δs o of 46 mm varying soil parameters resulted in a 37 increase in mean s m decreasing model performance whereas changes to crop parameters had minimal impact on s m less than 2 3 3 soil drainage simulated drainage at 1 5 m depth d m was 382 mm over the validation period for non irrigated lucerne within 3 of d o from six lysimeters and well within the range of measured values table 3 the start of drainage was delayed relative to d o and d m generally underestimated d o throughout the first drainage season april through october 2017 figs 2 and 5 two moderate drainage events which occurred in summer january and february 2018 were not predicted by the model while events from april 2018 onward were overestimated by d m twenty three peaks were identified in d o over the validation period while 20 were simulated by d m although just four of which occurred on the same day as peaks in d o cross correlation analysis indicated a lag of 1 day in d m relative to d o r 0 85 although weaker but still significant lag correlations were also observed at lag times of up to10 days for non irrigated lucerne the effect of using hydraulic parameters from the irrigated site increased drainage by 16 and correspondingly decreased model performance statistics table s1 varying the critical stress threshold from 0 2 to 0 6 had little impact on either cumulative d m or model performance statistics although an uncompensated root uptake model increased cumulative d m to within 0 5 of d o altering the partitioning of energy within the canopy by changing the light extinction coefficient had an effect of 3 on cumulative drainage but again had little impact on other model performance statistics for irrigated lucerne cumulative d m was 815 mm 24 greater than the value for d o table 3 d o was generally well simulated by d m during the first drainage season correctly predicting the start of drainage following a dry summer d m exceeded d o through winter may august 2017 and underestimated d o in spring and early summer figs 2 and 5 from january to july 2018 d o was overestimated by d m to a larger degree resulting in the cumulative difference under irrigation 42 peaks were identified in the d o time series thirty six peaks were identified in d m with 10 exact matches in peak timing with the d o time series the strongest correlation between d o and d m was observed at 0 days r 0 81 although there was strong lag correlation at 1 day r 0 76 and significant lags of lower correlations at 2 3 days under irrigation d m was relatively insensitive to parameter changes with all tested parameter sets within 1 of the original value the drainage results reported so far were obtained with the seepage face boundary condition aiming for best match of model and observations prescribing a free drainage boundary condition instead we obtained drainage of 457 mm at the non irrigated and 872 mm at the irrigated site an increase of 19 and 7 respectively over simulations using the seepage face boundary 4 discussion here we have applied the soil water flow model hydrus 1d parameterised with a detailed description of soil texture bulk density and stone content in combination with a widely used pedotransfer function to simulate components of water balance of stony alluvial soils planted with lucerne boundary conditions of the model were varied to best represent the measured conditions with the objective of explaining observed imbalances in the field measurements of water inputs and outputs performance of simulations varied by the component predicted d e or s irrigation management irrigated vs non irrigated as well as seasonally under non irrigated conditions cumulative d m and e m were within 4 and 3 of observed quantities respectively these results support previous findings within new zealand that d is relatively well simulated by models with hydraulic parameters derived from pedotransfer function for a range of soil types cichota et al 2013 likewise e m from penman monteith based approaches similar to that employed in hydrus 1d have performed well against e o from eddy covariance in other new zealand forage systems graham et al 2016 pronger et al 2016 our results provide further support for the use of models such as hydrus 1d for quantifying hydrological fluxes in rain fed forage systems without further site specific calibration for soil types with free draining subsoils however mean s m for the 1 5 m soil profile depth was on average 50 greater than that observed by soil moisture sensors suggesting that while fluxes of water can be well simulated the pedotransfer based approach employed here is not adequate for representing water storage within these stony alluvial soils despite overestimation of total water storage both seasonality of so and daily δso were reproduced well by the model under irrigated lucerne d m and e m overestimated observed cumulative totals by 24 and 6 respectively previous studies have shown that d o can be overestimated by d m under high water inputs however this effect is not systematic across soil types cichota et al 2013 wegehenkel and beyrich 2014 similarly noted a 20 overestimate of e o by e m from hydrus 1d for temperate grassland when compared to estimates from eddy covariance during wet periods these findings suggest that hydrological predictions for irrigated environments should be applied with caution the apparent errors in estimation of e m and d m for irrigated lucerne and s m under both management conditions must however be interpreted with respect to potential uncertainties in the measurement methods and spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem of immediate note is that field estimates of d e and δs amount to only 87 of measured water input a scenario which cannot be replicated by a single one dimensional model such imbalances have occurred at other sites where d e and s have been independently observed in the field graham et al 2018 measurement artefacts inherent to the lysimeter design are hypothesized to contribute to discrepancies in the observed water balance for irrigated lucerne laubach et al 2019 isolation of soil within the lysimeter removes tension normally exerted under conditions of pore connectivity application of tension to lysimeters similar to that exerted by the subsoil is known to increase drainage volumes zhu et al 2002 therefore when simulating d the lower boundary condition of hydrus 1d was here defined as a seepage face to best replicate the conditions of the lysimeter by contrast when modelling d at the scale measured by eddy covariance 100 200 m fetch a free drainage boundary condition should be employed while use of a seepage face boundary condition did produce the hypothesized effect of reducing drainage relative to a free drainage boundary modelled balances only show a discrepancy of 2 5 at the irrigated site in contrast to the 13 discrepancy in measurements suggesting there may be other factors involved in non closure of the water balance variability in measurements of rainfall and irrigation may likewise contribute to this apparent imbalance estimates of i for each site were a composite of measurements from two 150 mm diameter rain gauges despite being within 250 m distance of each other the individual rain gauges indicated a consistent 10 difference in recorded volume this was the case for paired gauges at both the irrigated and non irrigated sites this difference may reflect the inherent spatial variability of rainfall and irrigation however the systematic nature of this difference and its presence at both irrigated and non irrigated sites favours an explanation related to instrument error underestimation of turbulent energy exchange by the eddy covariance method has been reported widely in the literature leuning et al 2012 stoy et al 2013 thus a bias in e o may have contributed to the observed imbalance between observed water inputs and outputs as well as deviation from e m at both the irrigated and non irrigated site energy balance closure as evaluated by the slope of the relationship between available energy and turbulent exchanges was 90 however there was a distinct seasonality whereby the energy balance was nearly closed during spring and summer months october march when daily e was high and non closure occurred over autumn and winter months april september this finding is consistent with the observed cumulative difference between e m and e o which occurred between april and october 2017 unexplained bias resulting from imperfect energy balance closure may have contributed to both the imbalance in field measurements and differences between e m and e o although energy balance closure and its seasonality were similar for the two sites and does not account for the large difference in apparent model performance for irrigated versus non irrigated lucerne variations between observed and modelled d e and s may also be due to selection of hydraulic parameters as well as model concept selection of hydraulic parameters and corrections applied to account for stones likely influenced modelling outcomes hydraulic parameters were derived from a commonly used pedotransfer function rosetta based on texture and bulk density of the fine soil 2 mm values of k s θ r and θ s were then corrected treating stones as voids which do not contribute to storage or conductivity an approach which has been used for similar soils within the region as well as internationally dann et al 2009 mcneill et al 2018 previous studies suggest that the mean behaviour of so can be represented by s m using such parameterisation methods coppola et al 2013 ma et al 2010 on the other hand provide experimental evidence that stones do not behave as impermeable voids and the impact of stone content on hydraulic properties is non linear the performance of different pedotransfer functions likewise varies considerably for predicting water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity of contrasting new zealand thus an approach employing an ensemble of pedotransfer functions may yield improve modelled results cichota et al 2013 mcneill et al 2018 sensitivity testing in the present study indicates that farm scale spatial variability in soil properties can contribute to variations of up to 37 in s m while d m and e m fluctuate by up to 16 and 5 respectively by contrast crop parameters which determine root water uptake and partitioning of energy amongst evaporation and transpiration had relatively little impact on any of the modelled values it is clear that more attention is required for predicting hydraulic parameters to improve the accuracy of s m for these stony soils a single porosity hydraulic model was used in simulating water fluxes and storage however the stony soils at our study site are known to be prone to preferential flow carrick et al 2014 2013 carrick et al 2017 mcleod et al 2014 previous studies in the region have required a dual porosity approach to better represent water flow through stony soils brown et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 pollacco et al 2017 in the present study although drainage peaks were generally well resolved there was a significant lag in d m relative to d o observed at both sites this is likely a result of overestimation of water storage in the soil but may also be due to the inability of the single porosity concept to simulate enhanced conductivity through macropores inverse modelling approaches have been shown to estimate conductivity values which exceed those from pedotransfer function for these soils graham et al 2018 however when coupled with a single porosity approach the inversely derived parameters continue to produce a lag between d o and d m albeit reduced from pedotransfer derived parameter sets suggesting that a single porosity concept is insufficient to fully capture dynamics of drainage resulting from heterogeneous flow through preferential flow pathways considering uncertainties related to a simplified single matrix soil concept potential errors introduced by pedotransfer derived soil parameters errors in the model input data and imbalances in the observed water balance hydrus 1d predicted partitioning of water fluxes amongst d and e which was well matched to observations at both sites observed ratios of d o e o were 0 37 and 0 56 for non irrigated and irrigated sites respectively while the ratios d m e m for the same sites were 0 39 and 0 66 respectively the relative insensitivity of both d m and e m to crop and soil parameters under irrigation indicates overriding importance of water inputs and climatology in driving accumulations and temporal variability of d and e under conditions of lower water input at the non irrigated site crop and soil parameters are more important particularly for predicting d 5 conclusions cumulative volumes seasonality and short term variations in d and e were well simulated by hydrus 1d parameterised using a pedotransfer based approach for non irrigated lucerne grown on stony alluvial soils however water storage in the 1 5 m soil profile was overestimated by s m under irrigation d e and s were each overestimated by hydrus 1d while these results initially suggest that irrigation impacts the quality of modelling outcomes and caution should be used when interpreting simulations for such management practices these findings must be viewed considering uncertainties of both modelled and measured values related to spatial heterogeneity of the system methodological artefacts model concept input data and parameterisation method we find that temporal variability and partitioning of water fluxes to d and e are driven primarily by water inputs and climatology thus predictions are relatively insensitive to model structure and parameterisation however under non irrigated conditions soil hydraulic parameters become more important for simulating dynamics of d in general the greatest gains to modelling skill would result from improved pedotransfer based

10832,intercropping the medicine herbs i e amomum villosum and clerodendranthus spicatus with rubber tree in xishuangbanna prefecture of southwestern china is regarded as a promising solution to reduce the negative hydrological effects which were caused by the monocultural cultivation of rubber tree and improve the sustainability of aged rubber plantation however the water use characteristics of rubber tree in these agroforestry systems afss were still rarely reported and our current understanding of the below ground competition in such tree and herb afss is also insufficient therefore we adopted the techniques of stable isotopes to study the water use efficiency wue through leaf δ 13c and the water absorbing patterns through δ 2h and δ 18o of the aged rubber trees and the intercropped herbs for the investigation of their water competition and we also measured the contents of their leaf carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p to check the competition effects on the nutrient status of rubber tree as the results of bayesian mixing model mixsiar suggested the aged rubber trees in the rubber monoculture still absorbed the surface and shallow soil water 0 15 cm depths mainly same as the intercropped herbs in these afss but rubber trees in the afss prefer to absorb the middle and deep soil water below 15 cm depths such phenomenon verified that the water absorbing patterns of these aged rubber trees were still flexible however the leaf δ 13c of the rubber trees in these afss indicated their wue was not improved through the intercropping and thus the soil water content decreased in the afss in short intercropping the shallow roots medicine herbs i e a villosum and c spicatus can help the aged rubber trees use deeper soil water and thus help the rubber tree and intercrops form complementary water absorbing patterns in the pronounced dry season but there is no improvement in their wue and the soil water conditions in addition the decreased leaf n of rubber trees in the afss suggests that the n absorption of rubber trees was limited therefore intercropping the medicine herbs with rubber tree still need more consideration on the design of such afss especially in terms of the soil water conservation and management keywords agroforestry system amomum villosum clerodendranthus spicatus competition effect water use nutrients status 1 introduction in mainland southeast asia the negative effects of large cultivated areas of rubber tree hevea brasiliensis have widely concerned many people and international research institutions especially the negative effects on the local hydrological environment fox and castella 2013 wangpimool et al 2016 for a vivid example more than half a century of rubber tree cultivation in xishuangbanna prefecture resulted in a significant decrease in stream flow in many regions mann 2009 from the perspective in the eco physiology of rubber tree that is all because the root system of rubber tree is well developed and highly plastic priyadarshan 2011 which benefits them absorb water timely and efficiently in each rain event liu et al 2014 meanwhile the xylem duct diameter of rubber tree is wider than local native tree species and thus determine their higher water conduction efficiency ayutthaya et al 2011 what s more the water loss through the evapotranspiration from rubber plantation is great but the efficiency of the water use of rubber tree is low during the rainy season guardiola claramonte et al 2010 lin et al 2018 therefore soil in the rubber plantations cannot store enough water during the rainy season because of huge water consumption of the rubber tree the low flow and serious water resource shortage therefore would occur in the rubber cultivated areas as the dry season progresses tan et al 2011 except for the above problems the current high profile effect is the low price of natural rubber which has destabilized the livelihoods of rubber farmers wigboldus et al 2017 through the direct effects of this issue rubber plantations in xishuangbanna tend to convert to other monoculture plantations such as banana zhang et al 2014 such matter easily happened to the aged rubber plantation i e more than 32 years because the quality of latex would decline in these rubber plantations priyadarshan 2011 langenberger et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that increasing studies had found that the aged rubber plantations can be regarded as the large carbon sink and thus helped reduce the global warming mandal and islam 2010 song et al 2013 nizami et al 2014 and the total ecosystem carbon stock would reach the maximum level when they grow around 54 years liu et al 2017 meanwhile the aged rubber plantations could provide many favourable shelters for various animals under the canopies zhang et al 2017 and convert to the secondary forest because the well established shade environment is suitable for the growth of most tropical native tree species langenberger et al 2017 also aged rubber trees also exhibit great economic potential because they could produce more rubber seeds for producing rubber seed oil which could be used as edible oil or biofuel zhu et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that rubber trees in xishuangbanna were cultivated extensively since 1970 increasing rubber plantations therefore are getting old in this region li et al 2008 if they are converted to other plantations the consequences may still repeat the same environmental and economic problems of the prosperity and depression of cash crops most notably with bananas zhang et al 2014 therefore maintaining or removing those aged rubber plantations need comprehensive and scrupulous consideration on their ecological and economic potentials anyway related solutions are urgently needed for reversing the current negative effects of rubber cultivation and improving their sustainable development as a practical approach to implementing green rubber cultivation the rubber agroforestry system afs seems to be based on the comprehensive consideration of social economic and ecological benefits langenberger et al 2017 wigboldus et al 2017 for example rubber tea agroforestry system could sequestrate more co2 zhang et al 2007 conserve more soil water wu et al 2016 boost latex yield and gain more income than rubber monoculture feng 2007 despite many studies presented various suitable species for intercropping with rubber trees most of them merely focused on the economic benefits through plantation practices especially in terms of the additional income from the intercropped plants min et al 2017 for an afs if its design merely considers the economic potential rather than the ecological principles and environmental benefits it would not last long for example intense competition caused by the unreasonable combination of the tree and the intercropped species always results in poor plant growth low plant productivity and even plant death van noordwijk et al 2004 therefore it seems that most of our current theories about the construction of various rubber afss have fallen behind the practices especially in terms of the selection of intercropped species amomum villosum lour is an evergreen plant in the ginger family that grows in the shade of trees throughout southeast asia including southern china as a traditional chinese medicinal herb its fruits are used to treat gastrointestinal disease and toothache lai et al 2016 clerodendranthus spicatus thunb c y wu which is also a medicinal plant throughout southern china is used for treating the kidney diseases e g nephritis lithangiuria and cystitis because of its prominent anti inflammatory effect and nourishing function in the kidneys zheng et al 2012 these two kinds of herb species which exhibit high economic values easy beginning less input and fast returns in relation to other small tree or shrub species are regarded as the suitable intercropped species for increasing the additional income of rubber farmers and for remoulding the mid aged and aged rubber plantations in addition such intercropping could also help control weeds increase latex yield and adjust the microclimate of the plantation zhou 1993 feng 2007 therefore the cultivation of h brasiliensis i e rubber tree and a villosum afss ha and h brasiliensis and c spicatus afss hc used to be encouraged by the governments of yunnan province china fig s1 langenberger et al 2017 however previous studies on these rubber agroforestry systems rarely involved its ecohydrological functions the intercropping benefits on the water use of rubber tree in such afss were still reported rarely let alone the plant water relations in these afss it is worth mentioning that plant competition for water is a major hidden danger in these afss that is not only because plant competition for water directly related the normal growth of plant especially for these rainfed plantations but also because water could control the movement of soil nutrients and thus generate indirect effects on plant for example water could regulate soil n distribution through the process of infiltration leaching plant uptake or the microbial processes which were controlled through the soil moisture and thus altering the competitive outcome everard et al 2009 that is plant competition for water could also limit the nutrient absorption of the rubber tree and thus decrease the rubber yield therefore it is also necessary to check the nutrient status of rubber tree even in the study of plant water competition in order to investigate the plant water use and the interspecific interactions in ha and hc which were converted from the aged rubber monoculture rm we applied stable isotope techniques to study the plant water competitions i e hydrological niche which was confirmed through plant water absorbing patterns by the analysis of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the xylem and soil water through bayesian mixing model and water use efficiency wue which was analysed through the stable carbon isotope of the leaves of rubber trees and their intercropped herbs we also measured the concentrations of leaf c n and p of the rubber trees and their intercropped herbs in ha and hc to check the competition effects on plant nutrient status in the rainy and dry seasons in 2016 we then addressed two main questions 1 can intercropping with those two chinese traditional medicine herbs i e a villosum and c spicatus benefit to improve the water use of the aged rubber trees and the soil water condition in the afss 2 do the interspecific interactions between the aged rubber tree and the intercropped herb affect the nutrient absorption of rubber tree 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site we conducted this study in the rubber agroforestry demonstration zones around 6 9 ha in xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden chinese academy of sciences xtbg 21 55 36 n 101 15 60 e in menglun mengla yunnan southwestern china the climate in this region is mainly controlled by the tropical southern monsoon therefore the rainy may october and dry seasons november april are apparent in this region figs 2 and 3 dry season in this region exhibits less precipitation and higher air temperature the maximum air temperature in the day time always attains above 30 c especially from march to april the annual average precipitation is about 1550 mm and over 80 of precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season data was provided from xishuangbanna station for tropical rainforest ecosystem studies observations were conducted in two rubber based afss ha and hc and one rm fig s1 rubber trees in the rm were cultivated in the double row about 2 m row spacing and the distance between each double row was about 18 m and each pair of rubber tree within the same row was separated by 3 m the heights of rubber trees were about 35 m and the canopies of those plantations were not closed the common planting patterns of the rubber trees in xtbg were 3 m 7 m or 4 m 6 m before 1977 however the serious chilling injury which occurred in the winter of 1976 decimated a large proportion of rubber trees in xishuangbanna most of the rubber plantations in xtbg were therefore rebuilt since 1977 and the planting patterns of the rubber trees in our study sites were converted to the above wide row spacing patterns at that time such wide row spacing patterns could help improve the lighting conditions under the tree canopy and increase the air temperature in the internal of rubber plantations and thus decrease the foot disease of the rubber tree which is a kind of bark canker caused by the low temperature at the stem base feng 2007 therefore the rubber trees in this study were already 41 years old in 2016 2 years seeding cultivation plus 39 years planting history the afss in this study were converted from the monocultural rubber plantation since 2010 and only some weeds existed in the 18 m wide gap before that time because of weeding the intercropped herbs were planted densely about 30 cm 40 cm for a villosum and 15 cm 15 cm for c spicatus in the18 m wide gap in each afs in 2010 the heights of a villosum were about 1 2 1 6 m and the heights of c spicatus were less than 50 cm meanwhile the herbicide was only applied in rm for weed control the distance among each site was less than 100 m because of the similar management means these sites used to have many common characteristics such as well drained ﬁeld and flat land fig s1 however the bulk density of soil in ha and hc was lower than that of rm and soil physical structure became better by the comparison with the soil in rm after five years intercropping jiang et al 2017 the altitude of the study sites is approximately 500 m 2 2 sampling and measuring methods rainwater samples were collected immediately from a rain gauge after each effective rainfall event in the dry season and were collected weekly through a 2 5 l polyethylene bottle with funnel in the rainy season rainwater samples were stored in 2 ml screw cap plastic vials wrapped in parafilm a kind of plastic packaging and frozen until analysis because plant competition for water would occur when the water source becomes limited the best way for exploring plant water competition is to investigate the difference in the functional traits of plant water use in the water limited situation and water abundant situation craine and dybzinski 2013 because march is the hottest and driest period in the study region fig s2 and leaf flushing of rubber trees would occur at the middle of this month fig s3 rubber tree must acquire enough water for the following leaf expansion guardiola claramonte et al 2010 and plant competition for water therefore would be the most intense in the afss during this period in addition july always exhibits higher precipitation than other months which implies the water source would be abundant in this month fig s2 therefore soil and plant xylem samples were collected immediately in one sunny day separately during the pronounced dry season march 12 2016 and during the pronounced rainy season july 20 2016 each site was divided into serval blocks and each block contained six rubber trees fig s4 three blocks of each site were selected through simple random sampling lottery method and one or two trees in each block were selected through the same method in detail at midday of each sampling day plant transpiration pull would reach its maximum plant xylem samples of the rubber tree which consisted of 3 4 small cylinders of wood about 3 cm long were obtained through the increment borer meanwhile the xylem samples of the intercropped herbs were obtained by cutting the suberized rhizome segments through the pruner and the bark and phloem tissue were totally removed in total six xylem samples were collected from the six individual a villosum in ha i e two individual samples were collected in each block and three mixed samples were collected from three groups of the rhizomes of c spicatus because the xylems of their rhizomes were very thin and dense all xylem samples were sealed into the 12 ml transparent screw cap glass tubes and sealed through parafilm immediately and thus they were stored in the refrigerator at 20 until the extraction of xylem water through the actual measurements 12 whole root samples of each herb species the average vertical rhizosphere of a villosum in ha and c spicatus in hc were 15 14 2 7 cm and 17 08 2 8 cm respectively all the herb species in this study has lots of joint stolons and well developed lateral roots but their taproots were short figs s5 and s6 indeed some previous studies indicated that the root of a villosum was mainly concentrated in the soil layer above 15 cm depths zheng et al 2004 and the rhizosphere of c spicatus mainly reached the approximate range of 12 55 17 95 cm depth wang et al 2015 because the feeder roots of the rubber trees in mature monocultural rubber plantations are mostly found in the upper 30 cm of the soil priyadarshan 2011 and plant feeder roots can rarely be found below 80 cm soil depths through practical investigation four soil layers therefore were designed for sampling they were the surface soil layer 0 5 cm depths shallow soil layer 5 15 cm depths middle 15 30 cm depths and deep soil layer 30 80 cm depths respectively in rm soil samples were collected from these different soil layers at the middle position of these three randomly selected blocks through a soil auger 1 5 m long 4 cm in diameter a similar process was performed for the sampling in the ha and hc but there were two sampling positions in these afss they were located in the middle position of the rubber planting zone and the intercropped zone in each block respectively figs 1 and s4 each collected soil sample was scattered and re mixed immediately and divided into two parts finally one heavy part around 120 g was put into the zip lock plastic bag 10 cm 15 cm for measuring the absolute water content in the soil by the means of oven drying and one light part 5 10 g was sealed in the 12 ml screw cap glass tubes for the extraction of source water the soil samples for the water extraction were also stored in the refrigerator at 20 after the sampling the xylem water and soil water were extracted from the sampled xylem and soil materials through the cryogenic vacuum distillation system at the central laboratory in xtbg in order to extract the water completely all samples were heated for at least 90 min the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the rain water and extracted water were determined by isoprime100 isoprime stockport uk subsequently the isotopic ratios are shown with the per thousand symbols relative to v smow i e vienna standard mean ocean water and the instrument precision was 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o plant leaves were collected separately during the middle of the dry season march 12 2016 the late dry season may 21 2016 the early rainy season june 22 2016 and the middle of the rainy season july 20 2016 in each sampling day 1 2 branches were cut from three individual rubber trees which were located in three different blocks at each site for leaf sampling we mainly cut their branches from the sunny side of their canopy with tree pruners 15 m long while we were standing on a long ladder 20 m long for the intercropped herbs their leaves were directly collected from their canopy top in order to dry the leaf samples to a constant weight we put all samples into an electronic oven at 65 c for drying for at least two days after that the leaf samples were smashed by a pulveriser and then the powder was passed through the 100 mesh sieve for the measurement the leaf δ 13c was also measured through isoprime100 isoprime stockport uk the isotope ratios of the 13c were reported in per mil relative to v pdb i e vienna pee dee belemnite the concentrations of total leaf c and n were determined by the vario max cube elementar hanau ger at the central laboratory xtbg the concentrations of total leaf p were measured by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry thermo fisher waltham usa after being digested in hno3 hclo4 2 3 statistical analyses the local meteoric water line lmwl which expressed the relationship between δ 2h and δ 18o in the collected rainwater was defined through ordinary least squares regression the differences in the content of soil water and the compositions of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes i e the δ 2h and δ 18o values of soil water among seasons i e rainy and dry seasons sites i e rm ha and hc and soil depths i e four soil layers were analysed by the general linear models glms and the season site and depth were treated as fixed factors in the afss differences among seasons depths and rows i e rubber tree planting row and herb intercropping row in the compositions of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of soil water and the soil water content swc were also analysed by the glms and the season row and depth were treated as the fixed factors in addition the difference in the leaf δ 13c leaf nutrients concentration and ratios among the seasons sites and species i e rubber tree and the intercropped herb were analysed by glms for different purposes we selected different combinations of affected factors as the fixed factors tables 1 and 2 the post hoc tukey s test was applied for the comparison of the differences among groups if the differences were significant homoscedasticity of the data was checked before the statistical analyses and the data was log transformed to correct deviations if necessary the basic rationale in the isotope quantification analysis of plant water source is based on multi source mass balance phillips et al 2005 in fact mass balance is the basic rationale for all isotopic tracer methods fry 2006 according to the mass balance principle of isotopes the possible water absorbing proportion of each soil layer f1 f2 fi of plant can be determined by soil water isotope values δ 2h1 and δ 18o1 δ 2h2 and δ 18o2 δ 2hi and δ 18oi i e sources and the isotope values of plant xylem water δ 2hp and δ 18op i e mixture the formulas are presented as follows 1 δ 2 h p f 1 δ 2 h 1 f 2 δ 2 h 2 f i δ 2 h i 2 δ 18 o p f 1 δ 18 o 1 f 2 δ 18 o 2 f i δ 18 o i 3 f 1 f 2 f i 1 in general with the values of n isotopes the absorbing proportion of n 1 water sources for plant can be calculated if the source numbers are more than n 1 then the unknowns would be more than equations the traditional mixing model would have no unique solution phillips et al 2005 when the analysed sources were too many bayesian mixing models which use statistical distributions to characterize the uncertainties in the source and mixture isotopic values and the estimated source contributions were applied widely in the isotope analysis phillips et al 2014 in this study the mixsiar parnell et al 2013 which is a bayesian mixing model was applied to quantitively determine the contribution proportions of each water source i e water absorbing proportion in this study two stable isotopes 2h and 18o were used to estimate the water absorbing patterns of rubber trees and intercropped herbs with the consideration of the individual effects and the discrimination was set as 0 since the isotopic discrimination in the process of plant water uptake is very small and can be ignored phillips et al 2005 fry 2006 the run length of mcmc was set as very long for rubber trees which roots were well developed their water absorbing proportions from all soil layers in both rubber tree planting row and intercropped herbs row in the afs were calculated for all intercropped species only the soil water within the intercropped herbs rows was calculated i e only the vertical water absorbing patterns because their lateral root length was less than 20 cm in addition the interrelations among the leaf δ 13c the leaf c n and p concentrations of each plant species in each site were revealed through the spearman rank correlation test we mainly used r 3 5 2 for the statistical analyses r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 the stable isotopes of plant xylem water and soil water the stable isotope compositions i e δ 2h and δ 18o values of the xylem water of rubber trees were significantly lower than those of the intercropped herbs in ha and hc especially in the pronounced dry season p 0 01 fig 1 however the isotopic compositions of the xylem water of the rubber trees exhibited no significant differences among the sites the lmwl which is fitted through the linear regression of local rainwater δ 2h and δ 18o values are shown in fig 1 through the effects of evaporation the water isotopes of soil and plant xylem always distributed at the bottom and right of the lmwl benettin et al 2018 therefore the distribution of the plots of soil and plant xylem water isotopes in fig 1 proved the rationality of the water isotopes data in this study there existed significant differences in the isotopic compositions of soil water among the seasons the sites and the soil layers the same for the content of soil water in general the δ 2h and δ 18o values of soil water depleted significantly from the dry season to the rainy season p 0 01 and they were significantly higher in hc compared with the other two sites conversely the swcs of the rm were significantly higher relative to the swcs of ha and hc p 0 01 especially in the rainy season fig 2 in addition the soil water δ 2h and δ 18o values decreased gradually from the surface soil layer to the deep soil layer in the dry season fig 1d f however the differences among the soil layers were not obvious in the rainy season fig 1g i similarly swcs also decreased from the surface soil layer to the deep soil layer fig 2 except in hc table 1 furthermore whether in ha or hc no significant difference in the swcs was found between the rubber tree planting row and the intercropped herb row the same results occurred for the soil water δ 18o values in ha and the soil water δ 2h values in hc p 0 05 table 1 3 2 plant water sources based on the results of mixsiar the main water absorbing layer of rubber trees in the rm was the shallow soil layer 5 15 cm depths in the pronounced dry season 69 5 on average fig 1d however their main water absorbing layer was switched to the surface soil layer 0 5 cm depths in the pronounced rainy season 78 7 on average fig 1g rubber trees in ha relied much more water from 15 to 30 cm soil layers in the dry season 66 3 on average fig 1e table s1 in supplementary material 1 although their main water absorbing layer was also switched to the 0 5 cm soil layers during the pronounced rainy season 52 3 on average fig 1h table s1 they still maintained a certain absorbed proportion in the rest of soil layers i e 5 80 cm it seemed that rubber trees in ha preferred to absorb water from the soil in the rubber tree planting rows especially from the deeper soil layer in this area fig 1e and h though rubber trees in hc also enhanced their absorption of the 5 80 cm depth soil water their water absorbing proportions of the water from each soil layer seemed more stable and more equal relative to the rubber trees in other sites in each season fig 1f and i relative to rubber trees the intercrops absorbed more soil water from 0 to 15 cm soil layers 50 and the water absorbing proportions of each soil layer were more stable fig 1 table s1 no matter ha or hc in addition the water absorbing patterns of those two intercropped species looked similar 3 3 leaf δ 13c nutrient concentrations the mean values of the rubber leaf δ 13c were 31 39 31 28 and 31 30 in the rm ha and hc respectively additionally the mean values of the leaf δ 13c of the intercropped herbs were 29 49 in ha and 32 57 in hc differences in the rubber leaf δ13c values were not significant among the rm ha and hc table 2 but the rubber leaf δ13c values in the rainy season were significantly lower than those in the dry season furthermore significantly higher δ 13c values were found in the leaves of the intercropped herbs relatively to the leaves of rubber trees in ha p 0 01 but the results of comparison were opposite in hc table 2 fig 3 except for leaf p significant differences in the leaf nutrient concentration of rubber trees were found among the sites p 0 01 table 2 especially the leaf n the highest leaf n concentration of rubber tree was found in the rm 35 50 mg g 1 on average fig 4 followed by ha 32 61 mg g 1 on average and hc 31 42 mg g 1 on average because leaf flushing of rubber trees occurred in march n concentrations of their leaves were higher in this month than in other months except in march the leaf n concentrations of rubber tree in rm ha and hc were 30 15 mg g 1 25 39 mg g 1 and 27 81 mg g 1 respectively furthermore significant and positive correlation between the concentrations of the leaf n and p existed in all plants except for c spicatus in hc in the rm the leaf δ 13c of rubber trees had significant and positive correlations with their leaf n and p however rubber leaf δ 13c values merely had a significant and positive correlation with rubber leaf n concentrations in ha and hc 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic niche segregation because the deep soil water δ 2h and δ 18o values were relatively lower than the shallow soil water the significantly higher xylem water isotopic values of the intercropped herbs relative to the rubber trees indicated that the rubber trees preferred to absorb water from deeper soil layers than did the intercrops fig 1 though the differences in the xylem water isotopic values of the rubber trees were not significant among the sites the relatively higher soil water isotopic values in the afss suggested that the rubber trees in the afss absorbed deeper soil water much more than did the rubber trees in the rm especially for rubber trees in hc indeed those inferences were consistent with the result of mixsiar fig 1 it could be found that the aged rubber trees in the rm were still the surface feeders wu et al 2017 and they mainly depended on the soil water from the surface and shallow soil layers 0 15 cm especially in the rainy season this is because approximately 55 86 active roots of rubber tree in the mature monocultural rubber plantation are mainly distributed in the soil layers above 20 cm depth devakumar et al 1999 george et al 2009 similarly those two kinds of intercropped herbs in our study also depended on the soil water from 0 to 15 cm soil layers greatly and their absorbed proportion of the water from these four soil layers changed little with the changing season fig 1 therefore we can conclude that the feeder root distribution of the intercropped herbs was very shallow and fixed indeed the root of these herb species mainly concentrated in the soil layer above 20 cm depth zheng et al 2004 wang et al 2015 despite that the soil water from the soil depth below 20 cm could also be absorbed by the intercrops because of the hydraulic redistribution phenomenon which was caused by rubber trees wu et al 2017 as a widespread phenomenon hydraulic redistribution is always regarded as the phenomenon that most vascular plants transport soil water from the wet zone to the dry zone such as trees could redistribute the soil water from the moist soil of deep soil layer into dry soil in the surface soil layer bleby et al 2010 therefore deep soil also contributed a certain proportion of water to these two intercropped species in this study fig 1 however it can be found that the depth of the water uptake of rubber trees was increased through intercropping by the comparisons with the water uptake of rubber trees in the rm and afss i e ha an hc such water uptake strategy of rubber tree could avoid intense competition for water with the intercrops just like the competition response of rubber tree in rubber tea rubber coffee and rubber cocoa afss wu et al 2016 this phenomenon confirms that water absorbing patterns of aged rubber tree were also flexible priyadarshan 2011 liu et al 2014 not only that such flexibility of rubber trees could also be reflected in their horizontal water absorbing patterns such as rubber trees in ha absorbed more water from the rubber trees planting rows than that of intercrop planting rows especially during the pronounced dry season fig 1e therefore it may suggest that competition for water in the intercrops planting rows was relatively more intense in ha than in hc because rubber trees in hc exhibited no preference for absorbing water from rubber tree planting rows or intercrop planting rows despite the depths of the rhizospheres of both a villosum and c spicatus appeared to be similar a villosum had strong and developed stolon fig s5 which grows at the surface soil layer and exposes above the ground zheng et al 2004 and thus helps this species firmly and preferentially acquires the surface soil water from the competition with rubber trees in addition rubber trees in hc had more stable water absorbing patterns and the absorbed proportion of the water from each soil layer looked more equal relative to the rubber trees in other sites no matter under water abundant condition or water limited condition such water absorbing patterns may have been caused by the relatively stable soil water conditions in hc because no significant difference in the swcs was found in the depths or between the rubber tree planting row and the intercropped herb row table 1 furthermore their seasonal changes were also small in general rubber trees and the intercrops in each afs had relatively complementary vertical water absorbing patterns which would help to reduce their direct competition for water niranjana and viswanath 2008 such phenomenon can be regarded as the segregation of hydrological niche which has ever been defined as the segmentation of source water through different water uptake strategies of plants such as the various root distributions of coexisted plant species silvertown et al 2015 accordingly the intensities of the interspecific competition in the afss would be decreased and thus ensured their coexistence despite that they rely on nearly identical sources 4 2 comparison of plant water use efficiency it can be evidenced that all plants in this study belong to c3 photosynthesis plants because their leaf δ 13c values were all in the range from 20 to 34 farquhar et al 1989 leaf δ 13c therefore can be a reliable indicator to examine their long term wue because the canopies of all plantations in this study were not closed and all rubber trees were not too tall about 35 m the concentration of co2 in the air and the δ 13c values of atmospheric co2 would have no obvious stratification phenomenon because of the air turbulence dawson et al 2002 therefore plant wue can be compared through plant leaf δ 13c directly fry 2006 marshall et al 2007 it is worth explaining that using leaf δ 13c to compare wue could avoid the effects from the leaf to air vapour pressure difference during the long integration time when the carbon fixes in the plant marshall et al 2007 ehleringer et al 2013 and high δ 13c values always correspond to a high wue and low δ 13c values often indicate low wue ample water supplies and a larger stomatal opening that allows more co2 entry and ﬁxation fry 2006 as the leaf δ 13c values suggested the wue of rubber trees was not changed when they were intercropped with those medicinal herbs as we talked above rubber trees can consume massive soil water because they have developed root systems large xylem duct diameter ayutthaya et al 2011 and unrestricted leaf transpiration guardiola claramonte et al 2010 tan et al 2011 those water consumed characteristics were all related to the wue of rubber tree closely dawson et al 2002 so the unchanged wue of rubber trees in the afss indicated that their water consumed characteristics could not be affected by those intercropped herbs greatly that may be the reason why the swcs in these two afss were not improved in relation to those in the rm in addition we found that the wue of the intercropped herbs was relatively lower than that of the rubber trees in hc thus relatively lower swc appeared in hc even in the rainy season compared with other sites as farquhar et al 1989 suggested water availability light intensity co2 concentration and temperature are the main environmental factors that regulated plant wue i e leaf δ 13c since all plantations in this study have flat land un closed canopy and same planting patterns of rubber trees as we mentioned in the materials light intensity co2 concentration and temperature would not be the main factors to affect the wue of rubber trees only the difference in the soil water availability of these sites could result in the difference in the wue of rubber trees since intense competition for water is a main factor which directly i e plant pre emption on water source or indirectly i e the competition effects on the water holding capacity jiang et al 2017 reduces the availability of water in the soil and thus results in increased wue of rubber trees in the rubber agroforestry system wu et al 2016 therefore plant weak competition for water in ha and hc which may be caused by the complementary hydrological niches of the rubber tree and the intercropped herb as we discussed above could change the wue of rubber trees hardly 4 3 soil water conditions the isotopic values of soil water in the pronounced dry season were higher relative to the rainy season because soil water evaporation would be strong in the dry season which generally causes isotopic enrichment of soil water and because rainwater input was increased in the rainy season which generally causes isotopic depletion of water fry 2006 similarly the seasonal variations of soil evaporation and rainwater input also resulted in low swcs in the pronounced dry season but high swcs in the pronounced rainy season generally the soil in the afss should contain more water because intercropping could improve the soil physical conditions which helps soil store more rainwater jiang et al 2017 and the undergrowth cover can decrease soil evaporation and can capture throughfall intercept runoff and increase stemflow liu et al 2005 however the result seemed contradictory to this expectation because the swcs of ha and hc were significantly lower than those of the rm such results may be explained by the following possible speculations 1 the water consumed characteristics of the rubber trees were not changed through the intercropping as we discussed above 2 the competitors of rubber trees in the afss i e densely planted herbs would increase extra water consumption in short rubber trees are sensitive to the availability of soil water giambelluca et al 2016 therefore soil water availability or the fluctuations in the swcs would affect the water use characteristic of rubber trees greatly and thus affect their uptake of water and nutrients from the soil 4 4 intercropping effects on plant nutrients based on the comparison results of rubber leaf nutrients among the sites we found that the concentrations of rubber leaf c and n decreased from the rm to each afs especially the n concentration commonly the growth of plants and their defence reactions are all supported by carbohydrates and nitrogenous compounds chen et al 2005 and low leaf n concentration usually indicates low chlorophyll content muller et al 2009 but frequently results in an increased leaf n use efficiency which indicates a highly efficient use of accumulated rubisco therefore the decreased leaf n of rubber tree in the afss indicated that the leaf photosynthetic capacity of rubber tree would be weakened in these afss in addition the n concentration of the normal growth leaves of rubber trees were about 32 34 mg g 1 lu and he 1982 we therefore could find that the rubber trees in ha and hc suffered n deficiency fig 4 unlike leaf n the leaf p of rubber trees changed little from the rm to the afs in this study that could indicate that the p absorption of rubber tree was not limited in those afss such inconsistent results with leaf n could be attributed to the different mobility of these two nutrients in the soil the compounds of n in the soil exhibit high mobility and the intense competition for them always depends on the concentrated distribution of absorbed roots hodge et al 1999 however p compounds in the soil are relatively less mobile than the n compounds therefore plant competition for the less mobile resource will be weaker than that for a resource with high mobility huston and deangelis 1994 thus plant responses to n and p availability would be different because of the differences in their root distributions morphologies and physiologies since the rubber trees in the afss had a deeper water absorbing area than the rubber trees in the rm the rubber trees in the afss ought to have a wider nutrient absorption area than did the rubber trees in the rm which benefited their absorption for less mobile p resources we suspect there are three reasons why the n absorption of rubber trees in ha and hc was limited 1 the relatively lower swcs in ha and hc reduce n availability because water regulates n availability through the moisture dependence of microbial processes everard et al 2009 2 the dense planting of the intercropped herbs in both ha and hc weakens the contact between litter and soil thus preventing more nutrients transport from the above ground to below ground and the nutrients released by the litter could be preferentially absorbed by the intercropped herbs because their roots mainly concentrated into the shallow soil layer and even exposed above ground such phenomenon is chiefly caused by the mechanism that plants out compete others by fast and effective uptake of soil nutrients through plant root when meeting other species hodge et al 1999 craine and dybzinski 2013 3 a higher degree of preferential flows in both ha and hc jiang et al 2017 may intensify the decrease of soil n since the highly mobile soil n is easily leached during the rainy season in addition it is worth explaining that high leaf δ 13c has usually been cited as the plant physiological response to soil drought stress farquhar et al 1989 therefore the leaf δ 13c values of rubber trees in the dry season were higher than those in the rainy season therefore the disappeared positive correlations between the leaf δ 13c and leaf p of rubber tree in both ha and hc fig 5 a indicated that the p absorption of rubber trees could not adjust with their changed water use characteristics from the rm to these afss accordingly but such changes did not limit their requirement for p since both the leaf δ 13c and leaf p of rubber tree changed little from the rm to ha or hc furthermore the water use of the intercropped herbs in ha i e a villosum also regulated their n and p absorption because their leaf δ 13c had significant and positive correlations with their leaf n and p however the leaf nutrients of intercrops in hc i e c spicatus did not correlate with their leaf δ 13c this is due to the hydrological niches of the rubber trees and intercrops in hc were fixed and separated sufficiently their stable water absorbing patterns therefore could hardly affect their absorption of soil n and p 5 conclusion because monoculture rubber tree and intercropped herbs mainly take up surface and shallow soil water hydrologic niche overlaps between the aged rubber trees and the intercropped herbs in these afss must exist at the beginning of intercropping however the interspecific interactions would make rubber trees absorb more water from the deeper soil layers thus hydrologic niche separations would occur and the complementary water use patterns would be formed in ha and hc gradually such complementary water use patterns evidenced that the water uptake of aged rubber tree was still flexible and it would greatly weaken the competition for water between the rubber trees and the intercropped herbs however the weak competition for water in both ha and hc could not help improve the wue of rubber trees therefore the water consumed characteristics of rubber tree in those two afss may be similar to the rubber tree in rm because the water consumption increased by the densely intercropped herbs the swcs of both ha and hc were a bit lower than those of rm it is noteworthy that the intercropped herbs could affect the n absorption of rubber trees profoundly which resulted in a relatively lower n concentration in the leaves of rubber trees in ha and hc but the p absorption of rubber trees was not affected through the intercropping in short intercropping the shallow roots medicine herbs i e a villosum and c spicatus had remarkable effects on the water use patterns of the aged rubber tree but it seems difficult to improve the soil water conditions and such intercropping patterns also had negative effects on the n status of the rubber tree considering the economic potentials of these afss we suggest to intercrop some small tree or shrub species in the intercropped rows which would also help these afss convert to multispecies agroecosystems van noordwijk et al 2004 to enhance the interspecific competition for water and thus to improve the water consumed characteristics of rubber tree the ecological benefits of such afss still need to be assessed in the long term declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements we thank dr fu y dr deng y mr liu

10832,intercropping the medicine herbs i e amomum villosum and clerodendranthus spicatus with rubber tree in xishuangbanna prefecture of southwestern china is regarded as a promising solution to reduce the negative hydrological effects which were caused by the monocultural cultivation of rubber tree and improve the sustainability of aged rubber plantation however the water use characteristics of rubber tree in these agroforestry systems afss were still rarely reported and our current understanding of the below ground competition in such tree and herb afss is also insufficient therefore we adopted the techniques of stable isotopes to study the water use efficiency wue through leaf δ 13c and the water absorbing patterns through δ 2h and δ 18o of the aged rubber trees and the intercropped herbs for the investigation of their water competition and we also measured the contents of their leaf carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p to check the competition effects on the nutrient status of rubber tree as the results of bayesian mixing model mixsiar suggested the aged rubber trees in the rubber monoculture still absorbed the surface and shallow soil water 0 15 cm depths mainly same as the intercropped herbs in these afss but rubber trees in the afss prefer to absorb the middle and deep soil water below 15 cm depths such phenomenon verified that the water absorbing patterns of these aged rubber trees were still flexible however the leaf δ 13c of the rubber trees in these afss indicated their wue was not improved through the intercropping and thus the soil water content decreased in the afss in short intercropping the shallow roots medicine herbs i e a villosum and c spicatus can help the aged rubber trees use deeper soil water and thus help the rubber tree and intercrops form complementary water absorbing patterns in the pronounced dry season but there is no improvement in their wue and the soil water conditions in addition the decreased leaf n of rubber trees in the afss suggests that the n absorption of rubber trees was limited therefore intercropping the medicine herbs with rubber tree still need more consideration on the design of such afss especially in terms of the soil water conservation and management keywords agroforestry system amomum villosum clerodendranthus spicatus competition effect water use nutrients status 1 introduction in mainland southeast asia the negative effects of large cultivated areas of rubber tree hevea brasiliensis have widely concerned many people and international research institutions especially the negative effects on the local hydrological environment fox and castella 2013 wangpimool et al 2016 for a vivid example more than half a century of rubber tree cultivation in xishuangbanna prefecture resulted in a significant decrease in stream flow in many regions mann 2009 from the perspective in the eco physiology of rubber tree that is all because the root system of rubber tree is well developed and highly plastic priyadarshan 2011 which benefits them absorb water timely and efficiently in each rain event liu et al 2014 meanwhile the xylem duct diameter of rubber tree is wider than local native tree species and thus determine their higher water conduction efficiency ayutthaya et al 2011 what s more the water loss through the evapotranspiration from rubber plantation is great but the efficiency of the water use of rubber tree is low during the rainy season guardiola claramonte et al 2010 lin et al 2018 therefore soil in the rubber plantations cannot store enough water during the rainy season because of huge water consumption of the rubber tree the low flow and serious water resource shortage therefore would occur in the rubber cultivated areas as the dry season progresses tan et al 2011 except for the above problems the current high profile effect is the low price of natural rubber which has destabilized the livelihoods of rubber farmers wigboldus et al 2017 through the direct effects of this issue rubber plantations in xishuangbanna tend to convert to other monoculture plantations such as banana zhang et al 2014 such matter easily happened to the aged rubber plantation i e more than 32 years because the quality of latex would decline in these rubber plantations priyadarshan 2011 langenberger et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that increasing studies had found that the aged rubber plantations can be regarded as the large carbon sink and thus helped reduce the global warming mandal and islam 2010 song et al 2013 nizami et al 2014 and the total ecosystem carbon stock would reach the maximum level when they grow around 54 years liu et al 2017 meanwhile the aged rubber plantations could provide many favourable shelters for various animals under the canopies zhang et al 2017 and convert to the secondary forest because the well established shade environment is suitable for the growth of most tropical native tree species langenberger et al 2017 also aged rubber trees also exhibit great economic potential because they could produce more rubber seeds for producing rubber seed oil which could be used as edible oil or biofuel zhu et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that rubber trees in xishuangbanna were cultivated extensively since 1970 increasing rubber plantations therefore are getting old in this region li et al 2008 if they are converted to other plantations the consequences may still repeat the same environmental and economic problems of the prosperity and depression of cash crops most notably with bananas zhang et al 2014 therefore maintaining or removing those aged rubber plantations need comprehensive and scrupulous consideration on their ecological and economic potentials anyway related solutions are urgently needed for reversing the current negative effects of rubber cultivation and improving their sustainable development as a practical approach to implementing green rubber cultivation the rubber agroforestry system afs seems to be based on the comprehensive consideration of social economic and ecological benefits langenberger et al 2017 wigboldus et al 2017 for example rubber tea agroforestry system could sequestrate more co2 zhang et al 2007 conserve more soil water wu et al 2016 boost latex yield and gain more income than rubber monoculture feng 2007 despite many studies presented various suitable species for intercropping with rubber trees most of them merely focused on the economic benefits through plantation practices especially in terms of the additional income from the intercropped plants min et al 2017 for an afs if its design merely considers the economic potential rather than the ecological principles and environmental benefits it would not last long for example intense competition caused by the unreasonable combination of the tree and the intercropped species always results in poor plant growth low plant productivity and even plant death van noordwijk et al 2004 therefore it seems that most of our current theories about the construction of various rubber afss have fallen behind the practices especially in terms of the selection of intercropped species amomum villosum lour is an evergreen plant in the ginger family that grows in the shade of trees throughout southeast asia including southern china as a traditional chinese medicinal herb its fruits are used to treat gastrointestinal disease and toothache lai et al 2016 clerodendranthus spicatus thunb c y wu which is also a medicinal plant throughout southern china is used for treating the kidney diseases e g nephritis lithangiuria and cystitis because of its prominent anti inflammatory effect and nourishing function in the kidneys zheng et al 2012 these two kinds of herb species which exhibit high economic values easy beginning less input and fast returns in relation to other small tree or shrub species are regarded as the suitable intercropped species for increasing the additional income of rubber farmers and for remoulding the mid aged and aged rubber plantations in addition such intercropping could also help control weeds increase latex yield and adjust the microclimate of the plantation zhou 1993 feng 2007 therefore the cultivation of h brasiliensis i e rubber tree and a villosum afss ha and h brasiliensis and c spicatus afss hc used to be encouraged by the governments of yunnan province china fig s1 langenberger et al 2017 however previous studies on these rubber agroforestry systems rarely involved its ecohydrological functions the intercropping benefits on the water use of rubber tree in such afss were still reported rarely let alone the plant water relations in these afss it is worth mentioning that plant competition for water is a major hidden danger in these afss that is not only because plant competition for water directly related the normal growth of plant especially for these rainfed plantations but also because water could control the movement of soil nutrients and thus generate indirect effects on plant for example water could regulate soil n distribution through the process of infiltration leaching plant uptake or the microbial processes which were controlled through the soil moisture and thus altering the competitive outcome everard et al 2009 that is plant competition for water could also limit the nutrient absorption of the rubber tree and thus decrease the rubber yield therefore it is also necessary to check the nutrient status of rubber tree even in the study of plant water competition in order to investigate the plant water use and the interspecific interactions in ha and hc which were converted from the aged rubber monoculture rm we applied stable isotope techniques to study the plant water competitions i e hydrological niche which was confirmed through plant water absorbing patterns by the analysis of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the xylem and soil water through bayesian mixing model and water use efficiency wue which was analysed through the stable carbon isotope of the leaves of rubber trees and their intercropped herbs we also measured the concentrations of leaf c n and p of the rubber trees and their intercropped herbs in ha and hc to check the competition effects on plant nutrient status in the rainy and dry seasons in 2016 we then addressed two main questions 1 can intercropping with those two chinese traditional medicine herbs i e a villosum and c spicatus benefit to improve the water use of the aged rubber trees and the soil water condition in the afss 2 do the interspecific interactions between the aged rubber tree and the intercropped herb affect the nutrient absorption of rubber tree 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site we conducted this study in the rubber agroforestry demonstration zones around 6 9 ha in xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden chinese academy of sciences xtbg 21 55 36 n 101 15 60 e in menglun mengla yunnan southwestern china the climate in this region is mainly controlled by the tropical southern monsoon therefore the rainy may october and dry seasons november april are apparent in this region figs 2 and 3 dry season in this region exhibits less precipitation and higher air temperature the maximum air temperature in the day time always attains above 30 c especially from march to april the annual average precipitation is about 1550 mm and over 80 of precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season data was provided from xishuangbanna station for tropical rainforest ecosystem studies observations were conducted in two rubber based afss ha and hc and one rm fig s1 rubber trees in the rm were cultivated in the double row about 2 m row spacing and the distance between each double row was about 18 m and each pair of rubber tree within the same row was separated by 3 m the heights of rubber trees were about 35 m and the canopies of those plantations were not closed the common planting patterns of the rubber trees in xtbg were 3 m 7 m or 4 m 6 m before 1977 however the serious chilling injury which occurred in the winter of 1976 decimated a large proportion of rubber trees in xishuangbanna most of the rubber plantations in xtbg were therefore rebuilt since 1977 and the planting patterns of the rubber trees in our study sites were converted to the above wide row spacing patterns at that time such wide row spacing patterns could help improve the lighting conditions under the tree canopy and increase the air temperature in the internal of rubber plantations and thus decrease the foot disease of the rubber tree which is a kind of bark canker caused by the low temperature at the stem base feng 2007 therefore the rubber trees in this study were already 41 years old in 2016 2 years seeding cultivation plus 39 years planting history the afss in this study were converted from the monocultural rubber plantation since 2010 and only some weeds existed in the 18 m wide gap before that time because of weeding the intercropped herbs were planted densely about 30 cm 40 cm for a villosum and 15 cm 15 cm for c spicatus in the18 m wide gap in each afs in 2010 the heights of a villosum were about 1 2 1 6 m and the heights of c spicatus were less than 50 cm meanwhile the herbicide was only applied in rm for weed control the distance among each site was less than 100 m because of the similar management means these sites used to have many common characteristics such as well drained ﬁeld and flat land fig s1 however the bulk density of soil in ha and hc was lower than that of rm and soil physical structure became better by the comparison with the soil in rm after five years intercropping jiang et al 2017 the altitude of the study sites is approximately 500 m 2 2 sampling and measuring methods rainwater samples were collected immediately from a rain gauge after each effective rainfall event in the dry season and were collected weekly through a 2 5 l polyethylene bottle with funnel in the rainy season rainwater samples were stored in 2 ml screw cap plastic vials wrapped in parafilm a kind of plastic packaging and frozen until analysis because plant competition for water would occur when the water source becomes limited the best way for exploring plant water competition is to investigate the difference in the functional traits of plant water use in the water limited situation and water abundant situation craine and dybzinski 2013 because march is the hottest and driest period in the study region fig s2 and leaf flushing of rubber trees would occur at the middle of this month fig s3 rubber tree must acquire enough water for the following leaf expansion guardiola claramonte et al 2010 and plant competition for water therefore would be the most intense in the afss during this period in addition july always exhibits higher precipitation than other months which implies the water source would be abundant in this month fig s2 therefore soil and plant xylem samples were collected immediately in one sunny day separately during the pronounced dry season march 12 2016 and during the pronounced rainy season july 20 2016 each site was divided into serval blocks and each block contained six rubber trees fig s4 three blocks of each site were selected through simple random sampling lottery method and one or two trees in each block were selected through the same method in detail at midday of each sampling day plant transpiration pull would reach its maximum plant xylem samples of the rubber tree which consisted of 3 4 small cylinders of wood about 3 cm long were obtained through the increment borer meanwhile the xylem samples of the intercropped herbs were obtained by cutting the suberized rhizome segments through the pruner and the bark and phloem tissue were totally removed in total six xylem samples were collected from the six individual a villosum in ha i e two individual samples were collected in each block and three mixed samples were collected from three groups of the rhizomes of c spicatus because the xylems of their rhizomes were very thin and dense all xylem samples were sealed into the 12 ml transparent screw cap glass tubes and sealed through parafilm immediately and thus they were stored in the refrigerator at 20 until the extraction of xylem water through the actual measurements 12 whole root samples of each herb species the average vertical rhizosphere of a villosum in ha and c spicatus in hc were 15 14 2 7 cm and 17 08 2 8 cm respectively all the herb species in this study has lots of joint stolons and well developed lateral roots but their taproots were short figs s5 and s6 indeed some previous studies indicated that the root of a villosum was mainly concentrated in the soil layer above 15 cm depths zheng et al 2004 and the rhizosphere of c spicatus mainly reached the approximate range of 12 55 17 95 cm depth wang et al 2015 because the feeder roots of the rubber trees in mature monocultural rubber plantations are mostly found in the upper 30 cm of the soil priyadarshan 2011 and plant feeder roots can rarely be found below 80 cm soil depths through practical investigation four soil layers therefore were designed for sampling they were the surface soil layer 0 5 cm depths shallow soil layer 5 15 cm depths middle 15 30 cm depths and deep soil layer 30 80 cm depths respectively in rm soil samples were collected from these different soil layers at the middle position of these three randomly selected blocks through a soil auger 1 5 m long 4 cm in diameter a similar process was performed for the sampling in the ha and hc but there were two sampling positions in these afss they were located in the middle position of the rubber planting zone and the intercropped zone in each block respectively figs 1 and s4 each collected soil sample was scattered and re mixed immediately and divided into two parts finally one heavy part around 120 g was put into the zip lock plastic bag 10 cm 15 cm for measuring the absolute water content in the soil by the means of oven drying and one light part 5 10 g was sealed in the 12 ml screw cap glass tubes for the extraction of source water the soil samples for the water extraction were also stored in the refrigerator at 20 after the sampling the xylem water and soil water were extracted from the sampled xylem and soil materials through the cryogenic vacuum distillation system at the central laboratory in xtbg in order to extract the water completely all samples were heated for at least 90 min the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the rain water and extracted water were determined by isoprime100 isoprime stockport uk subsequently the isotopic ratios are shown with the per thousand symbols relative to v smow i e vienna standard mean ocean water and the instrument precision was 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o plant leaves were collected separately during the middle of the dry season march 12 2016 the late dry season may 21 2016 the early rainy season june 22 2016 and the middle of the rainy season july 20 2016 in each sampling day 1 2 branches were cut from three individual rubber trees which were located in three different blocks at each site for leaf sampling we mainly cut their branches from the sunny side of their canopy with tree pruners 15 m long while we were standing on a long ladder 20 m long for the intercropped herbs their leaves were directly collected from their canopy top in order to dry the leaf samples to a constant weight we put all samples into an electronic oven at 65 c for drying for at least two days after that the leaf samples were smashed by a pulveriser and then the powder was passed through the 100 mesh sieve for the measurement the leaf δ 13c was also measured through isoprime100 isoprime stockport uk the isotope ratios of the 13c were reported in per mil relative to v pdb i e vienna pee dee belemnite the concentrations of total leaf c and n were determined by the vario max cube elementar hanau ger at the central laboratory xtbg the concentrations of total leaf p were measured by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry thermo fisher waltham usa after being digested in hno3 hclo4 2 3 statistical analyses the local meteoric water line lmwl which expressed the relationship between δ 2h and δ 18o in the collected rainwater was defined through ordinary least squares regression the differences in the content of soil water and the compositions of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes i e the δ 2h and δ 18o values of soil water among seasons i e rainy and dry seasons sites i e rm ha and hc and soil depths i e four soil layers were analysed by the general linear models glms and the season site and depth were treated as fixed factors in the afss differences among seasons depths and rows i e rubber tree planting row and herb intercropping row in the compositions of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of soil water and the soil water content swc were also analysed by the glms and the season row and depth were treated as the fixed factors in addition the difference in the leaf δ 13c leaf nutrients concentration and ratios among the seasons sites and species i e rubber tree and the intercropped herb were analysed by glms for different purposes we selected different combinations of affected factors as the fixed factors tables 1 and 2 the post hoc tukey s test was applied for the comparison of the differences among groups if the differences were significant homoscedasticity of the data was checked before the statistical analyses and the data was log transformed to correct deviations if necessary the basic rationale in the isotope quantification analysis of plant water source is based on multi source mass balance phillips et al 2005 in fact mass balance is the basic rationale for all isotopic tracer methods fry 2006 according to the mass balance principle of isotopes the possible water absorbing proportion of each soil layer f1 f2 fi of plant can be determined by soil water isotope values δ 2h1 and δ 18o1 δ 2h2 and δ 18o2 δ 2hi and δ 18oi i e sources and the isotope values of plant xylem water δ 2hp and δ 18op i e mixture the formulas are presented as follows 1 δ 2 h p f 1 δ 2 h 1 f 2 δ 2 h 2 f i δ 2 h i 2 δ 18 o p f 1 δ 18 o 1 f 2 δ 18 o 2 f i δ 18 o i 3 f 1 f 2 f i 1 in general with the values of n isotopes the absorbing proportion of n 1 water sources for plant can be calculated if the source numbers are more than n 1 then the unknowns would be more than equations the traditional mixing model would have no unique solution phillips et al 2005 when the analysed sources were too many bayesian mixing models which use statistical distributions to characterize the uncertainties in the source and mixture isotopic values and the estimated source contributions were applied widely in the isotope analysis phillips et al 2014 in this study the mixsiar parnell et al 2013 which is a bayesian mixing model was applied to quantitively determine the contribution proportions of each water source i e water absorbing proportion in this study two stable isotopes 2h and 18o were used to estimate the water absorbing patterns of rubber trees and intercropped herbs with the consideration of the individual effects and the discrimination was set as 0 since the isotopic discrimination in the process of plant water uptake is very small and can be ignored phillips et al 2005 fry 2006 the run length of mcmc was set as very long for rubber trees which roots were well developed their water absorbing proportions from all soil layers in both rubber tree planting row and intercropped herbs row in the afs were calculated for all intercropped species only the soil water within the intercropped herbs rows was calculated i e only the vertical water absorbing patterns because their lateral root length was less than 20 cm in addition the interrelations among the leaf δ 13c the leaf c n and p concentrations of each plant species in each site were revealed through the spearman rank correlation test we mainly used r 3 5 2 for the statistical analyses r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 the stable isotopes of plant xylem water and soil water the stable isotope compositions i e δ 2h and δ 18o values of the xylem water of rubber trees were significantly lower than those of the intercropped herbs in ha and hc especially in the pronounced dry season p 0 01 fig 1 however the isotopic compositions of the xylem water of the rubber trees exhibited no significant differences among the sites the lmwl which is fitted through the linear regression of local rainwater δ 2h and δ 18o values are shown in fig 1 through the effects of evaporation the water isotopes of soil and plant xylem always distributed at the bottom and right of the lmwl benettin et al 2018 therefore the distribution of the plots of soil and plant xylem water isotopes in fig 1 proved the rationality of the water isotopes data in this study there existed significant differences in the isotopic compositions of soil water among the seasons the sites and the soil layers the same for the content of soil water in general the δ 2h and δ 18o values of soil water depleted significantly from the dry season to the rainy season p 0 01 and they were significantly higher in hc compared with the other two sites conversely the swcs of the rm were significantly higher relative to the swcs of ha and hc p 0 01 especially in the rainy season fig 2 in addition the soil water δ 2h and δ 18o values decreased gradually from the surface soil layer to the deep soil layer in the dry season fig 1d f however the differences among the soil layers were not obvious in the rainy season fig 1g i similarly swcs also decreased from the surface soil layer to the deep soil layer fig 2 except in hc table 1 furthermore whether in ha or hc no significant difference in the swcs was found between the rubber tree planting row and the intercropped herb row the same results occurred for the soil water δ 18o values in ha and the soil water δ 2h values in hc p 0 05 table 1 3 2 plant water sources based on the results of mixsiar the main water absorbing layer of rubber trees in the rm was the shallow soil layer 5 15 cm depths in the pronounced dry season 69 5 on average fig 1d however their main water absorbing layer was switched to the surface soil layer 0 5 cm depths in the pronounced rainy season 78 7 on average fig 1g rubber trees in ha relied much more water from 15 to 30 cm soil layers in the dry season 66 3 on average fig 1e table s1 in supplementary material 1 although their main water absorbing layer was also switched to the 0 5 cm soil layers during the pronounced rainy season 52 3 on average fig 1h table s1 they still maintained a certain absorbed proportion in the rest of soil layers i e 5 80 cm it seemed that rubber trees in ha preferred to absorb water from the soil in the rubber tree planting rows especially from the deeper soil layer in this area fig 1e and h though rubber trees in hc also enhanced their absorption of the 5 80 cm depth soil water their water absorbing proportions of the water from each soil layer seemed more stable and more equal relative to the rubber trees in other sites in each season fig 1f and i relative to rubber trees the intercrops absorbed more soil water from 0 to 15 cm soil layers 50 and the water absorbing proportions of each soil layer were more stable fig 1 table s1 no matter ha or hc in addition the water absorbing patterns of those two intercropped species looked similar 3 3 leaf δ 13c nutrient concentrations the mean values of the rubber leaf δ 13c were 31 39 31 28 and 31 30 in the rm ha and hc respectively additionally the mean values of the leaf δ 13c of the intercropped herbs were 29 49 in ha and 32 57 in hc differences in the rubber leaf δ13c values were not significant among the rm ha and hc table 2 but the rubber leaf δ13c values in the rainy season were significantly lower than those in the dry season furthermore significantly higher δ 13c values were found in the leaves of the intercropped herbs relatively to the leaves of rubber trees in ha p 0 01 but the results of comparison were opposite in hc table 2 fig 3 except for leaf p significant differences in the leaf nutrient concentration of rubber trees were found among the sites p 0 01 table 2 especially the leaf n the highest leaf n concentration of rubber tree was found in the rm 35 50 mg g 1 on average fig 4 followed by ha 32 61 mg g 1 on average and hc 31 42 mg g 1 on average because leaf flushing of rubber trees occurred in march n concentrations of their leaves were higher in this month than in other months except in march the leaf n concentrations of rubber tree in rm ha and hc were 30 15 mg g 1 25 39 mg g 1 and 27 81 mg g 1 respectively furthermore significant and positive correlation between the concentrations of the leaf n and p existed in all plants except for c spicatus in hc in the rm the leaf δ 13c of rubber trees had significant and positive correlations with their leaf n and p however rubber leaf δ 13c values merely had a significant and positive correlation with rubber leaf n concentrations in ha and hc 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic niche segregation because the deep soil water δ 2h and δ 18o values were relatively lower than the shallow soil water the significantly higher xylem water isotopic values of the intercropped herbs relative to the rubber trees indicated that the rubber trees preferred to absorb water from deeper soil layers than did the intercrops fig 1 though the differences in the xylem water isotopic values of the rubber trees were not significant among the sites the relatively higher soil water isotopic values in the afss suggested that the rubber trees in the afss absorbed deeper soil water much more than did the rubber trees in the rm especially for rubber trees in hc indeed those inferences were consistent with the result of mixsiar fig 1 it could be found that the aged rubber trees in the rm were still the surface feeders wu et al 2017 and they mainly depended on the soil water from the surface and shallow soil layers 0 15 cm especially in the rainy season this is because approximately 55 86 active roots of rubber tree in the mature monocultural rubber plantation are mainly distributed in the soil layers above 20 cm depth devakumar et al 1999 george et al 2009 similarly those two kinds of intercropped herbs in our study also depended on the soil water from 0 to 15 cm soil layers greatly and their absorbed proportion of the water from these four soil layers changed little with the changing season fig 1 therefore we can conclude that the feeder root distribution of the intercropped herbs was very shallow and fixed indeed the root of these herb species mainly concentrated in the soil layer above 20 cm depth zheng et al 2004 wang et al 2015 despite that the soil water from the soil depth below 20 cm could also be absorbed by the intercrops because of the hydraulic redistribution phenomenon which was caused by rubber trees wu et al 2017 as a widespread phenomenon hydraulic redistribution is always regarded as the phenomenon that most vascular plants transport soil water from the wet zone to the dry zone such as trees could redistribute the soil water from the moist soil of deep soil layer into dry soil in the surface soil layer bleby et al 2010 therefore deep soil also contributed a certain proportion of water to these two intercropped species in this study fig 1 however it can be found that the depth of the water uptake of rubber trees was increased through intercropping by the comparisons with the water uptake of rubber trees in the rm and afss i e ha an hc such water uptake strategy of rubber tree could avoid intense competition for water with the intercrops just like the competition response of rubber tree in rubber tea rubber coffee and rubber cocoa afss wu et al 2016 this phenomenon confirms that water absorbing patterns of aged rubber tree were also flexible priyadarshan 2011 liu et al 2014 not only that such flexibility of rubber trees could also be reflected in their horizontal water absorbing patterns such as rubber trees in ha absorbed more water from the rubber trees planting rows than that of intercrop planting rows especially during the pronounced dry season fig 1e therefore it may suggest that competition for water in the intercrops planting rows was relatively more intense in ha than in hc because rubber trees in hc exhibited no preference for absorbing water from rubber tree planting rows or intercrop planting rows despite the depths of the rhizospheres of both a villosum and c spicatus appeared to be similar a villosum had strong and developed stolon fig s5 which grows at the surface soil layer and exposes above the ground zheng et al 2004 and thus helps this species firmly and preferentially acquires the surface soil water from the competition with rubber trees in addition rubber trees in hc had more stable water absorbing patterns and the absorbed proportion of the water from each soil layer looked more equal relative to the rubber trees in other sites no matter under water abundant condition or water limited condition such water absorbing patterns may have been caused by the relatively stable soil water conditions in hc because no significant difference in the swcs was found in the depths or between the rubber tree planting row and the intercropped herb row table 1 furthermore their seasonal changes were also small in general rubber trees and the intercrops in each afs had relatively complementary vertical water absorbing patterns which would help to reduce their direct competition for water niranjana and viswanath 2008 such phenomenon can be regarded as the segregation of hydrological niche which has ever been defined as the segmentation of source water through different water uptake strategies of plants such as the various root distributions of coexisted plant species silvertown et al 2015 accordingly the intensities of the interspecific competition in the afss would be decreased and thus ensured their coexistence despite that they rely on nearly identical sources 4 2 comparison of plant water use efficiency it can be evidenced that all plants in this study belong to c3 photosynthesis plants because their leaf δ 13c values were all in the range from 20 to 34 farquhar et al 1989 leaf δ 13c therefore can be a reliable indicator to examine their long term wue because the canopies of all plantations in this study were not closed and all rubber trees were not too tall about 35 m the concentration of co2 in the air and the δ 13c values of atmospheric co2 would have no obvious stratification phenomenon because of the air turbulence dawson et al 2002 therefore plant wue can be compared through plant leaf δ 13c directly fry 2006 marshall et al 2007 it is worth explaining that using leaf δ 13c to compare wue could avoid the effects from the leaf to air vapour pressure difference during the long integration time when the carbon fixes in the plant marshall et al 2007 ehleringer et al 2013 and high δ 13c values always correspond to a high wue and low δ 13c values often indicate low wue ample water supplies and a larger stomatal opening that allows more co2 entry and ﬁxation fry 2006 as the leaf δ 13c values suggested the wue of rubber trees was not changed when they were intercropped with those medicinal herbs as we talked above rubber trees can consume massive soil water because they have developed root systems large xylem duct diameter ayutthaya et al 2011 and unrestricted leaf transpiration guardiola claramonte et al 2010 tan et al 2011 those water consumed characteristics were all related to the wue of rubber tree closely dawson et al 2002 so the unchanged wue of rubber trees in the afss indicated that their water consumed characteristics could not be affected by those intercropped herbs greatly that may be the reason why the swcs in these two afss were not improved in relation to those in the rm in addition we found that the wue of the intercropped herbs was relatively lower than that of the rubber trees in hc thus relatively lower swc appeared in hc even in the rainy season compared with other sites as farquhar et al 1989 suggested water availability light intensity co2 concentration and temperature are the main environmental factors that regulated plant wue i e leaf δ 13c since all plantations in this study have flat land un closed canopy and same planting patterns of rubber trees as we mentioned in the materials light intensity co2 concentration and temperature would not be the main factors to affect the wue of rubber trees only the difference in the soil water availability of these sites could result in the difference in the wue of rubber trees since intense competition for water is a main factor which directly i e plant pre emption on water source or indirectly i e the competition effects on the water holding capacity jiang et al 2017 reduces the availability of water in the soil and thus results in increased wue of rubber trees in the rubber agroforestry system wu et al 2016 therefore plant weak competition for water in ha and hc which may be caused by the complementary hydrological niches of the rubber tree and the intercropped herb as we discussed above could change the wue of rubber trees hardly 4 3 soil water conditions the isotopic values of soil water in the pronounced dry season were higher relative to the rainy season because soil water evaporation would be strong in the dry season which generally causes isotopic enrichment of soil water and because rainwater input was increased in the rainy season which generally causes isotopic depletion of water fry 2006 similarly the seasonal variations of soil evaporation and rainwater input also resulted in low swcs in the pronounced dry season but high swcs in the pronounced rainy season generally the soil in the afss should contain more water because intercropping could improve the soil physical conditions which helps soil store more rainwater jiang et al 2017 and the undergrowth cover can decrease soil evaporation and can capture throughfall intercept runoff and increase stemflow liu et al 2005 however the result seemed contradictory to this expectation because the swcs of ha and hc were significantly lower than those of the rm such results may be explained by the following possible speculations 1 the water consumed characteristics of the rubber trees were not changed through the intercropping as we discussed above 2 the competitors of rubber trees in the afss i e densely planted herbs would increase extra water consumption in short rubber trees are sensitive to the availability of soil water giambelluca et al 2016 therefore soil water availability or the fluctuations in the swcs would affect the water use characteristic of rubber trees greatly and thus affect their uptake of water and nutrients from the soil 4 4 intercropping effects on plant nutrients based on the comparison results of rubber leaf nutrients among the sites we found that the concentrations of rubber leaf c and n decreased from the rm to each afs especially the n concentration commonly the growth of plants and their defence reactions are all supported by carbohydrates and nitrogenous compounds chen et al 2005 and low leaf n concentration usually indicates low chlorophyll content muller et al 2009 but frequently results in an increased leaf n use efficiency which indicates a highly efficient use of accumulated rubisco therefore the decreased leaf n of rubber tree in the afss indicated that the leaf photosynthetic capacity of rubber tree would be weakened in these afss in addition the n concentration of the normal growth leaves of rubber trees were about 32 34 mg g 1 lu and he 1982 we therefore could find that the rubber trees in ha and hc suffered n deficiency fig 4 unlike leaf n the leaf p of rubber trees changed little from the rm to the afs in this study that could indicate that the p absorption of rubber tree was not limited in those afss such inconsistent results with leaf n could be attributed to the different mobility of these two nutrients in the soil the compounds of n in the soil exhibit high mobility and the intense competition for them always depends on the concentrated distribution of absorbed roots hodge et al 1999 however p compounds in the soil are relatively less mobile than the n compounds therefore plant competition for the less mobile resource will be weaker than that for a resource with high mobility huston and deangelis 1994 thus plant responses to n and p availability would be different because of the differences in their root distributions morphologies and physiologies since the rubber trees in the afss had a deeper water absorbing area than the rubber trees in the rm the rubber trees in the afss ought to have a wider nutrient absorption area than did the rubber trees in the rm which benefited their absorption for less mobile p resources we suspect there are three reasons why the n absorption of rubber trees in ha and hc was limited 1 the relatively lower swcs in ha and hc reduce n availability because water regulates n availability through the moisture dependence of microbial processes everard et al 2009 2 the dense planting of the intercropped herbs in both ha and hc weakens the contact between litter and soil thus preventing more nutrients transport from the above ground to below ground and the nutrients released by the litter could be preferentially absorbed by the intercropped herbs because their roots mainly concentrated into the shallow soil layer and even exposed above ground such phenomenon is chiefly caused by the mechanism that plants out compete others by fast and effective uptake of soil nutrients through plant root when meeting other species hodge et al 1999 craine and dybzinski 2013 3 a higher degree of preferential flows in both ha and hc jiang et al 2017 may intensify the decrease of soil n since the highly mobile soil n is easily leached during the rainy season in addition it is worth explaining that high leaf δ 13c has usually been cited as the plant physiological response to soil drought stress farquhar et al 1989 therefore the leaf δ 13c values of rubber trees in the dry season were higher than those in the rainy season therefore the disappeared positive correlations between the leaf δ 13c and leaf p of rubber tree in both ha and hc fig 5 a indicated that the p absorption of rubber trees could not adjust with their changed water use characteristics from the rm to these afss accordingly but such changes did not limit their requirement for p since both the leaf δ 13c and leaf p of rubber tree changed little from the rm to ha or hc furthermore the water use of the intercropped herbs in ha i e a villosum also regulated their n and p absorption because their leaf δ 13c had significant and positive correlations with their leaf n and p however the leaf nutrients of intercrops in hc i e c spicatus did not correlate with their leaf δ 13c this is due to the hydrological niches of the rubber trees and intercrops in hc were fixed and separated sufficiently their stable water absorbing patterns therefore could hardly affect their absorption of soil n and p 5 conclusion because monoculture rubber tree and intercropped herbs mainly take up surface and shallow soil water hydrologic niche overlaps between the aged rubber trees and the intercropped herbs in these afss must exist at the beginning of intercropping however the interspecific interactions would make rubber trees absorb more water from the deeper soil layers thus hydrologic niche separations would occur and the complementary water use patterns would be formed in ha and hc gradually such complementary water use patterns evidenced that the water uptake of aged rubber tree was still flexible and it would greatly weaken the competition for water between the rubber trees and the intercropped herbs however the weak competition for water in both ha and hc could not help improve the wue of rubber trees therefore the water consumed characteristics of rubber tree in those two afss may be similar to the rubber tree in rm because the water consumption increased by the densely intercropped herbs the swcs of both ha and hc were a bit lower than those of rm it is noteworthy that the intercropped herbs could affect the n absorption of rubber trees profoundly which resulted in a relatively lower n concentration in the leaves of rubber trees in ha and hc but the p absorption of rubber trees was not affected through the intercropping in short intercropping the shallow roots medicine herbs i e a villosum and c spicatus had remarkable effects on the water use patterns of the aged rubber tree but it seems difficult to improve the soil water conditions and such intercropping patterns also had negative effects on the n status of the rubber tree considering the economic potentials of these afss we suggest to intercrop some small tree or shrub species in the intercropped rows which would also help these afss convert to multispecies agroecosystems van noordwijk et al 2004 to enhance the interspecific competition for water and thus to improve the water consumed characteristics of rubber tree the ecological benefits of such afss still need to be assessed in the long term declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements we thank dr fu y dr deng y mr liu

10833,adult pomegranate trees punica granatum l cultivars wonderful and mollar de elche were submitted to different irrigation treatments during the 2015 and 2016 seasons control t0 plants were drip irrigated to guarantee non limiting soil water conditions t1 plants were subjected to water withholding during flowering fruit set period for 64 2015 and 53 2016 days resuming irrigation as in t0 plants subsequently in both cultivars the results demonstrated that during the flowering fruit set period the sensitivity to water stress is very small being possible to suppress or reduce irrigation at least while plant water status maintains similar levels to those reported in this study without affecting marketable yield and fruit size and composition thus this period can be considered as a clearly non critical period in this sense water saving was around 19 30 and water productivity wp increased around 4 14 in wonderful and 10 16 in mollar de elche water stress increased flowering but not the number of viable hermaphrodite flowers and decreased shoot growth tsg which could favour a compensatory young fruit growth when irrigation was resumed due to a shift in the carbon allocation

punica granatum regulated deficit irrigation water deficit water relations 1 introduction the availability of water for agricultural uses is the main challenge for optimal fruit trees farming under mediterranean conditions because rainfall has to be supplemented by irrigation to avoid harmful plant water deficit reducing regular fruit yield and enhancing alternate bearing pattern moreover climate change will inevitably lead to very frequent and severe droughts in a near future collins et al 2009 in agreement with galindo et al 2018 the main strategies to cope with water scarcity are i the use of improved innovative and precise deficit irrigation management practices able to minimize the impact on fruit yield and quality and ii the use of new plant materials less water demanding or able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality in relation to these plant materials it is important also to underline that agriculture has been focused on the cultivation of a very limited number of tree crop species and many others crops have been relegated to the status of neglected or underutilized crop species damaging the necessary agricultural biodiversity padulosi et al 2001 chivenge et al 2015 in relation with this last aspect pomegranate punica granatum l one of the oldest known edible fruits and one of the seven kinds of fruit mentioned in the bible is mainly grown in semi arid mild temperate to subtropical climates blumenfeld et al 2000 it is originally from central asia and actually the total area dedicated to its cultivation in the world is more than 302 000 ha with more than 76 found in five countries india iran china turkey and usa quiroz 2009 melgarejo et al 2012 spain is the main producer and exporting country of pomegranates in the european union and its cultivation has increased greatly in the past few years with a total surface in 2015 of 4 753 ha from which 3 197 ha are in production and yield 56 185 tons magrama 2016 this cultivation increase is due to a great consumers demand for pomegranate mainly because of the fruit beneficial effects on health e g lansky and newman 2007 and to the perfect acclimation of the crop to mediterranean edaphoclimatic conditions supporting heat and thriving even under desert conditions aseri et al 2008 intrigliolo et al 2013 rodríguez et al 2012 nevertheless to reduce the incidence of some fruit physiopathies e g fruit cracking and splitting galindo et al 2014 rodríguez et al 2018 and to reach optimal growth yield and fruit quality levin 2006 holland et al 2009 pomegranate for commercial production requires regular irrigation throughout the season regulated deficit irrigation rdi is probably the most useful deficit irrigation strategy to improve water saving and even harvest quality inducing minimum impacts in marketable yield rdi is based in reducing irrigation or non irrigating during the water stress tolerant phenological periods non critical periods and supplying full irrigation during the water stress sensitive phenological periods critical periods chalmers et al 1981 geerts and raes 2009 galindo et al 2018 intrigliolo et al 2013 studied the pomegranate response to rdi involving irrigation water restrictions during different fruit stages and concluded that water deficit during flowering fruit set period is the best rdi strategy for pomegranate trees and that the linear fruit growth phase and the last part of fruit growth and ripening are critical periods nevertheless these last authors concluded that the water stress achieved was very mild and the water saving very scarce 9 14 then research focussed on the response of pomegranate trees to severe water deficit during flowering fruit set it is necessary to optimize rdi in pomegranate trees the research reported in this paper was conducted to test the hypotheses that i irrigation withholding during flowering fruit set period can improve water saving and even fruit quality without affecting marketable yield and that ii rdi could constitute a tool to increase pomegranate consumers acceptance and farmers crop revenues 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant

resumed ψstem values in t1 plants increased very rapidly reaching values similar to those observed in t0 plants figs 2 and 3 differences in gs values between t0 and t1 plants gradually increased due

of the wonderful cultivar table 1 vhf values were similar in both cultivars and were not affected by water deficit table 1 however tnf values were higher in mollar de elche than in wonderful cultivar and increased by water stress effect table 1 both cultivars showed similar ty my nf and fw values in 2015 and 2016 and a clear absence of the water deficit effect on the other hand in both cultivars wp values were significantly higher in t1 than in t0 plants in addition in wonderful plants a seasonal effect was observed being wp values in 2016 higher than in 2015 table 1 peel colour was not significantly affected by water stress table 2 even though t1 fruits increased arils a values in both cultivars and c values in wonderful fruits table 3 wonderful peel fruit showed seasonal

table 3 mollar de elche peel fruit showed seasonal differences increasing l and hº values in 2016 and a values in 2015 whereas the seasonal effect was significant in arils l and b values which decreased in 2016 respect to 2015 tables 2 and 3 the water deficit in t1 plants did not affect the fruit arils chemical composition tables 4 and 5 even though the seasonal effect was significant when

pun and ea values and lower mi and frap values in 2016 than in 2015 season tables 4 and 5 moreover fruit arils chemical composition showed some important differences between both pomegranate cultivars in fact wonderful arils showed substantially higher ta ca and suc values than mollar de elche arils table 4 4 discussion the irrigation scheduling of the mollar de elche and wonderful t0 plants allowed high values of ψstem and gs during both experimental periods figs 2 and 3 suggesting the absence of limiting factors for the etc to be fulfilled rodríguez et al 2012 galindo et al 2013 2014 however t1 plants on both cultivars reached an important water deficit level during the irrigation withholding periods as indicated by ψstem and gs values whereas similar ψstem and gs values to those observed in t0 plants were reached during the periods of full irrigation figs 2 and 3 additionally considering that seasonal rainfall was very scarce mainly in the 2016 season fig 1 it is evident that irrigation was the main factor affecting the pomegranate water relations during the season figs 2 and 3 in agreement with the results obtained by rodríguez et al 2012 the gs decrease in response to irrigation withholding and the fast gs recovery when irrigation was restored indicated that stomatal aperture was controlled directly only by a hydroactive mechanism nevertheless under a more severe water stress or a longer stress period situation hormonal changes at leaf levels could have taken place delaying stomatal aperture after rehydration mansfield 1987 davies and zhang 1991 ruiz sánchez et al 1997 intrigliolo et al 2013 suggested that mild water deficit during flowering fruit set period saving a 9 14 irrigation water was the best rdi strategy for mollar de elche pomegranate trees because minimal negative effects on fruit yield take place current results confirmed that flowering fruit set period is a non critical period for pomegranate culture however irrigation water restrictions and plant water stress levels were far more important than those reported previously by intrigliolo et al 2013 because water saving were between 19 and 30 in 2015 and 2016 respectively and the plant water stress was clearly important figs 2 and 3 this water saving increased 4 14 and 10 16 in wonderful and in mollar de elche respectively wp values because marketable yield and fruit size were not affected table 1 parvizi et al 2014 thus this wp increase and the reduction in the pruning cost tsg reduction table 1 khattab et al 2012 constitutes a very important finding to increase the farmers crop revenues considering that in pomegranate trees spring vegetative growth and flowering fruit happen simultaneously the reduction in tsg values by water stress table 1 could decrease the competition between both processes favouring flowering tsg decrease can be considered as an advantageous result because a compensatory young fruit growth could be favoured when irrigation was resumed due to a shift in the carbon allocation pattern whereof similar fw values in both irrigation treatments were attained table 1 abrisqueta et al 2008 in both cultivars there was a similar incidence of peel cracking or splitting and sunburn fruit physiopathies in t0 and t1 plants data not shown even though fruit sunburn was much more important than the other physiopathies which were very low this similar incidence of fruit physiopathies in t0 and t1 plants explained the absence of irrigation effect also in my values from both cultivars table 1 moreover in agreement with galindo et al 2014 2018 the low peel cracking or splitting incidence could be due to the fact that all treatments were adequately irrigated from the end of fruit set to harvest it is known that irrigation can modify processes related to fruit trees floral biology such as the duration of phenological stages flowering intensity and fruit set e g borroto and rodríguez 1977 maranto and hake 1985 ruiz sánchez et al 1988 at first sight the increase in pomegranate tnf values in t1 plants could be interpreted as an evolutive process to ensure the survival of the species under severe water stress conditions however under the current experimental conditions this assumption was unsubstantiated because the increase in tnf values in t1 plants was due to an increase in nvhf values because no differences between treatments were observed in vhf values and consequently ty was similar in t0 and t1 treatments table 1 despite the expected significant effect of cultivar and season on some fruit characteristics the water withholding effect was very scarce inducing significant changes only in some fruit colour parameters tables 2 5 specifically t1 fruits showed reddish arils which could be due to an anthocyanins content increase which can be considered an advantageous characteristic leading to a better consumers acceptance of pomegranate fruits this is always important but mainly in mollar de elche cultivar fruits in which red colour has important implications for their market price the reduced vegetative growth in water withheld trees table 1 could have induced a higher sunlight fruits exposure and as a consequence a higher red appearance similar results have been showed by li et al 1989 and gelly et al 2003 in peach fruits and laribi et al 2013 in pomegranate fruits moreover castellarin et al 2007a b suggested a direct effect of water stress on the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in grapevines 5 conclusions the above mentioned results showed that in wonderful and mollar de elche pomegranate trees the flowering fruit set phenological period can be considered as a non critical period because the sensitivity to water stress is small which makes possible to suppress or reduce irrigation at least while plant water status maintains similar levels to those reported in this study under our experimental conditions irrigation withholding during this period led to clearly important water deficit levels water saving of around 19 30 and a wp increase of 4 16 without affecting marketable yield and fruit size the water stress achieved led to an increase in tnf values due only to higher nvhf values and to a tsg reduction which could favour a compensatory young fruit growth when irrigation was resumed due to a shift in the carbon allocation pattern the wp increase and the pruning cost reduction tsg decrease in t1 plants constitute very important aspects to increase the farmer crop revenues despite irrigation withholding effect on fruit characteristics was very scarce the fact that t1 fruits showed reddish arils constitute other complementary advantage to improve consumer s acceptance and commercial price of pomegranate fruits mainly that of mollar de elche

10833,adult pomegranate trees punica granatum l cultivars wonderful and mollar de elche were submitted to different irrigation treatments during the 2015 and 2016 seasons control t0 plants were drip irrigated to guarantee non limiting soil water conditions t1 plants were subjected to water withholding during flowering fruit set period for 64 2015 and 53 2016 days resuming irrigation as in t0 plants subsequently in both cultivars the results demonstrated that during the flowering fruit set period the sensitivity to water stress is very small being possible to suppress or reduce irrigation at least while plant water status maintains similar levels to those reported in this study without affecting marketable yield and fruit size and composition thus this period can be considered as a clearly non critical period in this sense water saving was around 19 30 and water productivity wp increased around 4 14 in wonderful and 10 16 in mollar de elche water stress increased flowering but not the number of viable hermaphrodite flowers and decreased shoot growth tsg which could favour a compensatory young fruit growth when irrigation was resumed due to a shift in the carbon allocation pattern this wp increase the reduction in pruning cost tsg decrease and the redder arils in t1 plants were key aspects to increase consumers acceptance and farmers crop revenues keywords fruit quality punica granatum regulated deficit irrigation water deficit water relations 1 introduction the availability of water for agricultural uses is the main challenge for optimal fruit trees farming under mediterranean conditions because rainfall has to be supplemented by irrigation to avoid harmful plant water deficit reducing regular fruit yield and enhancing alternate bearing pattern moreover climate change will inevitably lead to very frequent and severe droughts in a near future collins et al 2009 in agreement with galindo et al 2018 the main strategies to cope with water scarcity are i the use of improved innovative and precise deficit irrigation management practices able to minimize the impact on fruit yield and quality and ii the use of new plant materials less water demanding or able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality in relation to these plant materials it is important also to underline that agriculture has been focused on the cultivation of a very limited number of tree crop species and many others crops have been relegated to the status of neglected or underutilized crop species damaging the necessary agricultural biodiversity padulosi et al 2001 chivenge et al 2015 in relation with this last aspect pomegranate punica granatum l one of the oldest known edible fruits and one of the seven kinds of fruit mentioned in the bible is mainly grown in semi arid mild temperate to subtropical climates blumenfeld et al 2000 it is originally from central asia and actually the total area dedicated to its cultivation in the world is more than 302 000 ha with more than 76 found in five countries india iran china turkey and usa quiroz 2009 melgarejo et al 2012 spain is the main producer and exporting country of pomegranates in the european union and its cultivation has increased greatly in the past few years with a total surface in 2015 of 4 753 ha from which 3 197 ha are in production and yield 56 185 tons magrama 2016 this cultivation increase is due to a great consumers demand for pomegranate mainly because of the fruit beneficial effects on health e g lansky and newman 2007 and to the perfect acclimation of the crop to mediterranean edaphoclimatic conditions supporting heat and thriving even under desert conditions aseri et al 2008 intrigliolo et al 2013 rodríguez et al 2012 nevertheless to reduce the incidence of some fruit physiopathies e g fruit cracking and splitting galindo et al 2014 rodríguez et al 2018 and to reach optimal growth yield and fruit quality levin 2006 holland et al 2009 pomegranate for commercial production requires regular irrigation throughout the season regulated deficit irrigation rdi is probably the most useful deficit irrigation strategy to improve water saving and even harvest quality inducing minimum impacts in marketable yield rdi is based in reducing irrigation or non irrigating during the water stress tolerant phenological periods non critical periods and supplying full irrigation during the water stress sensitive phenological periods critical periods chalmers et al 1981 geerts and raes 2009 galindo et al 2018 intrigliolo et al 2013 studied the pomegranate response to rdi involving irrigation water restrictions during different fruit stages and concluded that water deficit during flowering fruit set period is the best rdi strategy for pomegranate trees and that the linear fruit growth phase and the last part of fruit growth and ripening are critical periods nevertheless these last authors concluded that the water stress achieved was very mild and the water saving very scarce 9 14 then research focussed on the response of pomegranate trees to severe water deficit during flowering fruit set it is necessary to optimize rdi in pomegranate trees the research reported in this paper was conducted to test the hypotheses that i irrigation withholding during flowering fruit set period can improve water saving and even fruit quality without affecting marketable yield and that ii rdi could constitute a tool to increase pomegranate consumers acceptance and farmers crop revenues 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant

and the plant water stress was clearly important figs 2 and 3 this water saving increased 4 14 and 10 16 in wonderful and in mollar de elche respectively wp values because marketable yield and fruit size were not affected table 1 parvizi et al 2014 thus this wp increase and the reduction in the pruning cost tsg reduction table 1 khattab et al 2012 constitutes a very important finding to increase the farmers crop revenues considering that in pomegranate trees spring vegetative growth and flowering fruit happen simultaneously the reduction in tsg values by water stress table 1 could decrease the competition between both processes favouring flowering tsg decrease can be considered as an advantageous result because a compensatory young fruit growth could be favoured when irrigation was resumed due to a shift in the carbon allocation pattern whereof similar fw values in both irrigation treatments were attained table 1 abrisqueta et al 2008 in both cultivars there was a similar incidence of peel cracking or splitting and sunburn fruit physiopathies in t0 and t1 plants data not shown even though fruit sunburn was much more important than the other physiopathies which were very low this similar incidence of fruit physiopathies in t0 and t1 plants explained the absence of irrigation effect also in my values from both cultivars table 1 moreover in agreement with galindo et al 2014 2018 the low peel cracking or splitting incidence could be due to the fact that all treatments were adequately irrigated from the end of fruit set to harvest it is known that irrigation can modify processes related to fruit trees floral biology such as the duration of phenological stages flowering intensity and fruit set e g borroto and rodríguez 1977 maranto and hake 1985 ruiz sánchez et al 1988 at first sight the increase in pomegranate tnf values in t1 plants could be interpreted as an evolutive process to ensure the survival of the species under severe water stress conditions however under the current experimental conditions this assumption was unsubstantiated because the increase in tnf values in t1 plants was due to an increase in nvhf values because no differences between treatments were observed in vhf values and consequently ty was similar in t0 and t1 treatments table 1 despite the expected significant effect of cultivar and season on some fruit characteristics the water withholding effect was very scarce inducing significant changes only in some fruit colour parameters tables 2 5 specifically t1 fruits showed reddish arils which could be due to an anthocyanins content increase which can be considered an advantageous characteristic leading to a better consumers acceptance of pomegranate fruits this is always important but mainly in mollar de elche cultivar fruits in which red colour has important implications for their market price the reduced vegetative growth in water withheld trees table 1 could have induced a higher sunlight fruits exposure and as a consequence a higher red appearance similar results have been showed by li et al 1989 and gelly et al 2003 in peach fruits and laribi et al 2013 in pomegranate fruits moreover castellarin et al 2007a b suggested a direct effect of water stress on the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in grapevines 5 conclusions the above mentioned results showed that in wonderful and mollar de elche pomegranate trees the flowering fruit set phenological period can be considered as a non critical period because the sensitivity to water stress is small which makes possible to suppress or reduce irrigation at least while plant water status maintains similar levels to those reported in this study under our experimental conditions irrigation withholding during this period led to clearly important water deficit levels water saving of around 19 30 and a wp increase of 4 16 without affecting marketable yield and fruit size the water stress achieved led to an increase in tnf values due only to higher nvhf values and to a tsg reduction which could favour a compensatory young fruit growth when irrigation was resumed due to a shift in the carbon allocation pattern the wp increase and the pruning cost reduction tsg decrease in t1 plants constitute very important aspects to increase the farmer crop revenues despite irrigation withholding effect on fruit characteristics was very scarce the fact that t1 fruits showed reddish arils constitute other complementary advantage to improve consumer s acceptance and commercial price of pomegranate fruits mainly that of mollar de elche

10834,vegetable production in many countries relies on irrigation while increasing irrigation amount normally improves yield too much water could jeopardize fruit quality and comprise profit optimizing irrigation frequency and amount is thus essential to ensuring yield increase without compromising fruit quality this paper presents a three year 2011 2013 experimental study on responsive changes in yield fruit quality and water use efficiency wue of tomato grown in greenhouse to different irrigation frequency and amount under drip irrigation the irrigation scheduling was based on accumulative evaporation ae measured from a standard 20 cm pan three irrigation frequencies were considered in which irrigation was resumed when ae was 10 mm i 1 20 mm i 2 and 30 mm i 3 respectively each frequency was associated with four irrigation amounts which were 50 k cp1 70 k cp2 90 k cp3 and 110 k cp4 of ae respectively water consumption yield characteristics and fruit quality of the plants in each treatment were measured the three year results show that for each irrigation amount increasing irrigation frequency led to an increase in yield and wue visual fruit quality traits including average weight longitudinal and transverse diameter increased with irrigation amount but not with irrigation frequency it was found that a reduction in irrigation amount increased all other fruit quality characteristics except the sugar organic acid ratio in 2013 both yield and wue increased asymptotically with irrigation amount before approaching their plateau when the irrigation amount reached 90 and 70 of ae respectively while the yield was positively related to fruit size and negatively to soluble solid content it was independent of wue the results from technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution analysis revealed that among all treatments i 1 k cp2 was the optimal in terms of best balancing yield fruit quality and water use efficiency principal component analysis found that the comprehensive fruit quality score was closely related to the total soluble solids content keywords irrigation frequency and amount tomato yield water use efficiency fruit quality comprehensive evaluation 1 introduction tomato is a staple commercial vegetable grown mainly in greenhouse in many countries to bridge the seasonal gap in its production yuan et al 2001 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 it is rich in phytonutrients including lycopene β carotene and vitamin c and is hence beneficial to reducing the risk of various cancers favati et al 2009 rosales et al 2011 as living standard has been rising the demand for tomato has shifted from quantity to quality chen et al 2013 the nutrient contents in tomato depend not only on its genetic origin but also on the environment in which it grows dumas et al 2003 rosales et al 2011 improving cultivational practices especially irrigation liu et al 2013 can therefore offer an alternative to improve fruit yield and quality drip irrigation can deliver water and nutrients to desirable root zone and has hence become the dominant irrigation method in greenhouse production compared with traditional border and furrow irrigation drip irrigation reduces water loss from evapotranspiration and percolation thereby saving water and fertilizers under certain circumstances it can even reduce soil degradation and salinity yohannes and tadesse 1998 hanson and may 2004 mahajan and singh 2006 irrigation frequency and amount are two design parameters in irrigation scheduling uçan et al 2007 sezen et al 2008 liu et al 2013 çolak et al 2018 because excessive irrigation could result in anoxic spots and impeding oxygen diffusion while inadequate irrigation might lead to water stress suppressing crop growth mitchell et al 1991 sezen et al 2008 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 2014 du et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the impact of irrigation frequency and amount on crop growth varies with region and crop varieties existing study on impact of irrigation frequency on vegetable production is inconclusive with some showing that under the same irrigation amount increasing frequency does benefit yield and water use efficiency wue of crops such as potato melon bell pepper and green beans sezen et al 2006 wang et al 2006 sensoy et al 2007 sezen et al 2008 çolak et al 2018 due to the improved soil environment while others showing no or even adverse impact for crops such as cucumber ertek et al 2006a radish wan and kang 2006 sesame uçan et al 2007 and blueberry holzapfel et al 2015 the efficacy of irrigation scheduling in improving crop production depends on soil moisture content there has been an increase in use of remote sensors to monitor soil moisture content over the past decade but direct use of these sensors in irrigation design is still in its infancy because the inherent heterogeneity of soil and the point based nature of the sensors could make the measurements unrepresentative wan and kang 2006 qiu et al 2013 yan et al 2019 as such alternative methods have been used as a proxy for evapotranspiration including evaporation measured from pans to design irrigation scheduling of both drip and sprinkler irrigation for a wide variety of crops grown in both field and greenhouse yuan et al 2003 2004 liu and kang 2006 wan and kang 2006 junzeng et al 2008 wang et al 2009 zeng et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zuo et al 2016 du et al 2017 wang et al 2017 because the evaporation measured from a pan differs from water consumed by crop their relationship has been intensively studied for a variety of crops under various environments yuan et al 2001 sensoy et al 2007 liu et al 2013 soil water mediates transformations of plant nutrients and their uptake by roots and irrigation therefore impacts fruit quality however there is no standardized protocol to quantify fruit quality the commonly used method in the literature is to compare the visual appearance nutritional quality taste and storage qualities for processing of the fruit wang et al 2015 with each characterized by a number of indices for example the nutritional quality could be represented by carotenoid lycopene vc sugar organic acid and protein while the visual appearance can be quantified by fruit size and color wang et al 2011 qiu et al 2017 over the past few years a variety of methods have been proposed to comprehensively assess fruit quality and its relationship with water including principal component analysis pca analytic hierarchy process ahp gray relational analysis gra and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis wang et al 2011 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 measuring fruit quality indices especially the nutritional indices however is time consuming and labor intensive difficult to access by farmers a natural question is thus if some indices can be made redundant without compromising assessment result also quality assessment needs to consider profitability as boosting yield by solely increasing irrigation amount could compromise fruit quality and result in a profit loss luo and li 2018 the multi objective decision making method topsis provide a solution to this topsis calculates the comprehensive benefits by evaluating the relative similarity between different objects as well as the positive and negative ideal solutions luo and li 2018 it has been used to estimate benefit of greenhouse tomato production liu et al 2013 luo and li 2018 the feasibility of using the evaporation measured from pan as a proxy for evapotranspiration to determine irrigation frequency and amount sezen et al 2008 liu et al 2013 has been investigated previously based on subjective analysis and experimental data evaluation however the variation in experience and perspective between decision makers could give rise to biased verdict therefore methods able to comprehensively determine optimal irrigation frequency and amount for greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation is needed in order to ameliorate the deficiency of the commonly used subjective evaluation method considering the limited study in this area the purpose of this paper is to present a method to quantify the effect of drip irrigation frequency and amount on yield fruit quality and water use efficiency of tomato farmers concern profitability and consumers care about fruit quality as both are affected by soil water dynamics we hypothesize that it is possible to design an optimal irrigation scheduling for crop which is capable of best balancing its yield fruit quality and water use efficiency we tested this by taking tomato grown in greenhouse as an example the plants were drip irrigated under different irrigation amounts and frequencies and the data measured from the experiment were used to compare the benefits of all treatments using topsis from which the optimal irrigation scheduling was obtained 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse from 2011 to 2013 at the experimental station of farmland irrigation research institute at xinxiang henan province of china latitude 35 19 n longitude 113 53 e altitude 73 2 m the annual mean air temperature and duration of sunshine is 13 5 c and 2497 h respectively with 220 frost free days the annual mean precipitation and potential evaporation over the past 50 years on the site was 580 mm and 2000 mm respectively the greenhouse was 40 m 8 5 m covered by a fogging resistance polyethylene film with a planting area of 272 3 m2 there was no heating system and thermal preservation was achieved by covering quilts over the polyethylene film during earlier spring the interior temperature was controlled by roof vents the depth of groundwater table on the site is more than 5 m and the soil is fluvo aquic eutyic cambisols with a sandy loam texture usda soil classification system the bulk density and field capacity of the soil was 1 38 g cm 3 and 24 mass water content respectively the mean permanent wilting point of the 0 100 cm soil was 8 mass water content soil available n p and k were 45 3 3 2 and 91 2 mg kg 1 respectively and the organic matter in the 0 60 cm soil was 31 3 g kg 1 2 2 experimental design and management compound fertilizer consisting of 70 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg p2o5 ha 1 together with 130 kg ha 1 of k2o and 25 t ha 1 of chicken dung was broadcasted over the soil surface as base fertilizer prior to ploughing with a rotary spader to 16 cm deep seeds of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv jingding were germinated in a seedbed and healthy seedlings were transplanted to the greenhouse on march 14 in 2011 march 30 in 2012 and march 28 in 2013 when the fifth leaf emerged each plot was 7 5 m 1 1 m into which 50 seedlings were planted in two rows spaced by 40 cm with an intra row plant distance of 30 cm adjacent plots were separated by a 10 cm wide ridge and the inter plot row distance was 70 cm to ensure plant survival after the transplantation each plot was irrigated with an equal amount of water 46 3 mm in 2011 45 mm in 2012 and 2013 to bring the 0 40 cm soil water content to 90 of the field capacity the treatment started when the average 0 40 cm soil water content dropped to 70 of the field capacity the irrigation frequencies were determined based on the accumulative evaporation ae measured from a 20 cm pan not a standard pan worldwide but recommended in china for measuring evaporation as a reference the pan was mounted in the greenhouse above the canopy and irrigation was resumed when the ae measured daily at 8 00 a m using a glass graduated flask reached 10 2 mm i 1 20 2 mm i 2 and 30 2 mm i 3 respectively each irrigation frequency was associated with four irrigation amounts 50 k cp1 70 k cp2 90 k cp3 and 110 k cp4 of ae overall there were 12 treatments each having three replications arranged randomly in split plots the total number of irrigation events wnum for each frequency and its associated four irrigation amounts are given in table 1 along with the average irrigation amount of each irrigation event the external diameter of the plastic drip irrigation strip was 16 mm and one strip was associated with one row of plant the intra strip emitter distance was 30 cm and the discharge rate of each emitter was 1 2 l h 1 operated by a constant pressure at 100 kpa there was a valve integrated with a pressure gauge for each plot to control irrigation and the operating pressure the irrigation amount for each plot was measured by a flow meter the plots were hydraulically isolated by plastic film to prevent lateral water flow three micro lysimeters 1 m x 1 m x 1 m were installed at different locations in the greenhouse to measure daily evapotranspiration and drainage the plants were pruned just above the fourth truss and the branch stems were also removed at their emergence stage tomato tone was sprayed once a week over the canopy from the onset of flowering stage in all treatments aimed to increase fruit setting ismail et al 2008 the plants in all treatments were top dressed three times during the fruiting stage via fertigation with the first two top dressings applying 30 kg ha 1 of urea each and the last one applying 20 kg ha 1 of urea other managements including weed removal disease and pest control were the same in all treatments the first fruit harvest was on may 27 in 2011 and 2012 and june 6 in 2013 when 90 of the fruits become red since then each plot was harvested twice a week 2 3 measurements and computational methods 2 3 1 soil moisture and water consumption gravimetric water content at 20 cm interval within 0 100 cm soil was measured by coring every 10 days from a site 15 cm away from a drip emitter in the intra row direction during the growth season ismail et al 2008 the irrigation amount w i m3 of each plot was calculated by ertek et al 2006b 1 w i 1 1000 a a e k where a is the area of the plot m2 ae is the accumulative evaporation measured from the 20 cm pan mm and k is the plant pan coefficient water consumption by the plant et mm was calculated using the following water balance equation allen 1998 yan et al 2018 2 e t p w i u r d w δ s where p is the effective precipitation mm w i is the irrigation amount mm u is water movement from deep soil into the root zone mm r is surface runoff mm d w is water percolation out of the root zone mm and s is the change in soil water within 0 100 cm soil mm precipitation downward soil water movement and surface runoff were negligible under drip irrigation in the greenhouse and the above equation can thus be simplified to qiu et al 2013 2015 3 e t w i δ s 2 3 2 fruit yield and water use efficiency red and disease free fruits from twenty plants in the middle of each plot were sampled to measure their marketable yield mean fruit weight and fruit diameter the weight of each tomato was measured using a scale with precision of 0 1 g and fruit diameter was measured using a vernier caliper water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation uçan et al 2007 qiu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 yang et al 2017 4 w u e y e t 100 where y is the marketable yield t ha 1 and et is the total evapotranspiration mm 2 3 3 fruit quality indices six fruits were selected randomly from each plot for food quality measurement at early middle and late harvesting stage the fruit firmness ff was measured by a hardometer gy 3 top hangzhou china the total soluble solids content tss was measured by a hand held refractometer with automatic temperature compensation pr 32α atago tokyo japan the vitamin c vc in ascorbic acid was calculated by the classical titration method with the 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenols sodium salt solution the soluble sugar content ssc was measured by anthrone method wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 organic acidity oa was titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh first and then calculated as equivalence of citric acid expressed as percentage of fresh mass wilson and walker 1976 soluble protein sp content was measured using coomassie brilliant blue and sugar acid ratio sar was determined by dividing the soluble sugar content in each plot by organic acidity in the plot 2 3 4 meteorological data the meteorological data were collected from a standard automatic weather station installed in the middle of the greenhouse to measure solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity throughout the growth season the monthly mean solar radiation air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd are given in table 2 2 4 calculation of the comprehensive quality score with the principal component analysis pca comprehensive quality score of the tomato was evaluated with the pca it consists of the following six sequential steps wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 i constructing the original multiple quality parameter matrix 5 a a i j n p a 11 a 12 a 1 p a 21 a 22 a 2

irrigation schedule using topsis the optimal irrigation scheduling best balancing the yield fruit quality and water use efficiency was calculated using topsis which consists of the following five

used to analyze the yield wue and the fruit quality indices with the glm procedure in spss version 21 0 ibm corp armonk ny the mean values were compared for significance using the duncan s multiple range tests pca was employed to assess the association between fruit quality indices using canoco 5 ter braak 1989 topsis was solved using microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 changes in soil water content changes in 0 40 cm soil water content are compared in fig 1 for all treatments as anticipated soil water content increased with irrigation amount the impact of irrigation frequency on soil water varied with irrigation amount with the soil water content oscillating more under high irrigation amount than under low irrigation amount fig 1 if the plants were assumed to have suffered water stress when the 0 40 cm soil water content was below 70 of the field capacity increasing irrigation frequency delayed the water stress for example for irrigation frequency i 1 in 2011 water stress occurred on may 10 and 20 under k cp1and k cp2 respectively while the reduced irrigation frequency in i 2 and i 3 brought this to april 30 fig 1 also reveals that the 0 40 cm soil water content in all treatments never exceeded the field capacity 33 and deep percolation thus did not occur consistent with the measurements from the three lysimeters 3 2 the yield the yield was affected significantly p 0 05 by irrigation frequency i and amount k cp individually but not interactively by their combination table 3 when irrigation amount was the same increasing irrigation frequency benefited yield significantly compared with i 3 over the three seasons i 1 and i2 increased the average yield by 7 6 and 5 7 respectively yet no significant difference was found between i 1 and i 2 when the irrigation frequency was the same yield increased asymptotically with irrigation amount table 3 fig 2 compared with k cp4 over the three seasons k cp1 and k cp2 reduced the average yield by 25 4 and 5 3 respectively the average yields of k cp3 and k cp4 were comparable indicating that when the irrigation frequency was the same a further increase in irrigation amount from k cp3 did not give a noticeable increase in yield it was also found that the yield in 2011 and 2012 was 15 2 and 12 1 respectively lower than that in 2013 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency irrigation amount significantly affected the water consumption whereas there was no noticeable difference in water consumption between different irrigation frequencies when the irrigation amount was the same fig 3 water consumption increased with irrigation amount compared with k cp4 over the three seasons k cp1 k cp2 and k cp3 reduced the average water consumption by 30 7 20 3 and 12 4 respectively water consumption in 2011 and 2012 was comparable but fell significantly in 2013 due to the drop in evaporation manifest by the accumulative evaporation measured from the pan which in 2011 and 2012 was 11 1 and 10 4 respectively higher than that in 2013 fig 3 both irrigation frequency and amount affected wue p 0 05 although their interactive effect on yield was insignificant except in 2011 compared with i 3 over the three years the irrigation frequency i 1 and i 2 increased the average wue by 5 7 and 4 2 respectively table 3 again there was no significant difference in wue between i 1 and i 2 irrigation amount k cp2 gave the highest wue in 2011 and 2012 but it was comparable with k cp3 in 2013 showing that a further increase in irrigation amount from k cp2 did not lead to a noticeable increase in wue fig 4 in addition wue peaked in 2013 due to the increased yield and reduced water consumption figs 2 and 3 the average wue in 2013 increased by 29 1 and 25 8 respectively compared to that in 2011 and 2012 3 4 fruit quality table 4 shows the fruit quality indices for all treatments visual quality indices such as mean fruit weight mfw longitudinal diameter ld and transverse diameter td increased steadily with irrigation amount but not with irrigation frequency except mfw in 2013 the impact of irrigation frequency and amount on other fruit quality indices varied with seasons in different ways for example an increase in irrigation frequency improved tss vc and fruit firmness ff significantly but not for tss in 2013 irrigation frequency and amount did not interactively alerted tss vc and ff but significantly affected tss in 2012 and vc in 2013 the results also showed that irrigation amount had a marked effect on ssc in 2012 and 2013 whereas irrigation frequency had a significant effect on ssc in 2011 irrigation frequency and amount did not interactively impact ssc oa sugar acid ratio sar and soluble protein content sp among the 24 quality indices obtained from the split plot anova 23 except sar in 2013 were affected by irrigation amount 13 responded to irrigation frequency yet only three felt the impact of irrigation frequency and amount simultaneously at significant level 3 5 relationship between fruit quality indices the correlations between the fruit quality indices in the three years are approximately the same and we hence only present the 2013 results table 5 there was a positive correlation between all visual quality indices mfw was independent of sar but negatively correlated to tss vc ssc oa sp and ff tss was positively correlated to all nutritious and storage quality indices but not to sar these confirmed that the impact of irrigation scheduling on nutritional quality and storage quality indices i e fruit firmness was consistent and that tss can be used as an indicator for both nutritional quality and storage quality notice however that tss was negatively related to visual fruit quality indices and that irrigation scheduling affected visual quality and nutritional quality of the fruits in different ways 3 6 comprehensive quality evaluated by pca the variance contribution of the first and second principal component was 81 9 and 11 1 respectively fig 5 and the accumulative variance contribution was 93 0 these two principal components explain most variance information in the original quality data and can represent the 10 fruit comprehensive quality indices the first component reflects the impact of tss ssc oa vc and sp which have large factor loading values and represent the nutritional quality the second component reflects the impact of sar ff and td which respectively represent flavor storage and visual quality of the fruit and have large factor loading values the comprehensive fruit quality scores for different treatments are shown in table 6 i 1 k cp1 had the highest score giving the optimal comprehensive quality and i 2 k cp4 is the worst a positive correlation r2 0 9817 between tss and the comprehensive quality scores was found at significant level fig 6 eliciting that tss represents the comprehensive fruit quality 3 7 balance between yield fruit quality and water use efficiency tss can be used as an indicator for comprehensive quality the comprehensive benefit in the calculation considered the balance between yield fruit quality and water use efficiency the results are shown in table 7 in the analysis a ranking score for each year was assigned and the results in 2011 and 2013 were consistent in which i 1 k cp2 was the optimal irrigation scheduling with its ci value being 0 788 and 0 746 respectively the optimal irrigation scheduling in 2012 was i 1 k cp3 but it differed from i 1 k cp2 marginally with its ci value increasing only by 2 2 averaged over the three years i 1 k cp2 had the highest ci value at 0 746 giving the optimal comprehensive benefit and best balancing the yield fruit quality and water use efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 effect on yield and wue irrigation is the only way to replenish the soil water taken up by crop in greenhouse chen et al 2014 the effect of irrigation on plant growth and fruit quality depends on timing and amount of the irrigation when total irrigation amount is the same increasing irrigation frequency can keep the water within a small volume of soil in the root zone to promote root growth and facilitate root uptake of resources kang et al 2004 wang et al 2006 it hence improves the transfer of nutrients and photosynthetic products to reproductive organs wang et al 2006 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 and increases fruit number as a result liu et al 2013 the improved yield as irrigation frequency increased in our experiment was mainly due to the increased fruit number liu et al 2013 rather than the weight of individual fruit table 4 consistent with previous studies on tomato pires et al 2011 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 and other crops such as bell pepper sezen et al 2006 and melon sensoy et al 2007 the improved wue due to irrigation frequency increase was ascribed to the increased yield fig 2 and table 3 as there was only a minor difference in water consumption between different irrigation frequencies fig 3 reducing irrigation amount compromised yield in all three seasons because tomato is a water demanding crop chen et al 2014 and sensitive to water stress especially during flowering and fruit setting stage flowering and fruit setting occur concurrently as new trusses develop pulupol et al 1996 and the occurrence of a water stress could thus reduce fruit number and fruit weight liu et al 2013 the reduction in yield due to water stress was caused by dwindled fruit number and reduced fruit weight table 4 agreeing with previous findings pulupol et al 1996 favati et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 our results showed that severe water deficit or excessive irrigation reduced wue although a slight water stress could facilitate wue fig 4 and table 3 the finding that the maximum wue was not associated with the minimum irrigation amount is due to that the increased water stress suppressed plant growth and thereby reduced its ultimate yield table 3 consistent with previous studies on tomato potato and eggplant kang et al 2004 ertek et al 2006b cantore et al 2016 similarly the minimum wue was not associated with the maximum irrigation amount because it enhanced non productive transpiration table 3 confirming that increasing irrigation amount benefits yield but not water use efficiency cantore et al 2016 du et al 2017 the high yield in 2013 is probably because vpd in 2013 was lower than that in 2011 and 2012 table 2 which reduced water accumulation and resulted in a relative increase in the dry weight within the fruit rosales et al 2011 and a decrease in fresh weight table 4 although the irrigation amount in 2013 was less than that in 2011 and 2012 the reduced water consumption by crop coupled with a rise in yield led to an increase in wue fig 4 4 2 effects on fruit quality indices soil water mediates nutrients transformation in soil and their uptake by plant roots it therefore has a direct link with food quality it is the irrigation amount rather than irrigation frequency that markedly impacted fruit size table 4 in general the growth of a fruit during its ripening stage largely depends on photosynthetic capacity and or the distribution of photoassimilates between different plant tissues rodriguez ortega et al 2017 increasing irrigation frequency can ameliorate water stress fig 1 and thus facilitates production and transfer of photosynthetic products in the form of sucrose to reproductive organs which is evident in the improved fruit ssc observed in our experiment although the improvement is not always significant as an important quality index tss represents the proportion of the dissolved solids in solution which in the tomato fruit pulp comprises 65 sugars sucrose and hexoses 13 acids citrate and malate and 12 other minor components including phenols amino acids soluble pectins ascorbic acid and minerals kader 2008 chen et al 2014 the proportion of ssc and organic acidity in tss were 55 and 11 respectively table 4 alluding to that increasing irrigation frequency might have boosted the production of tss yet it was found that tss ssc and organic acidity all increased inversely with irrigation amount under water deficit the translocation of phloem sap to fruit was impeded and the solute concentration in the sap therefore increased this could reduce water flow from the xylem to fruit mitchell et al 1991 guichard et al 2001 which with the accumulation of sugars and acids unaffected led to an increase in their concentration in the fruit and a consequent improvement in fruit quality mitchell et al 1991 chen et al 2014 in addition water stress boosted starch accumulation in immature fruits mitchell et al 1991 and facilitated starch translocation into the hexose within the mature fruits thereby increasing tss and ssc in the fruit wang et al 2011 fruit flavor depends on aroma components malundo et al 1995 and the taste is largely determined by the contents of sugar solution and organic acids as well as their ratio kader 2008 the 2011 results were consistent with these however there was a slight increase in sugar acid ratio in 2013 indicating that the relative sugar and organic acids content was independent of irrigation in 2013 table 4 due to the reduced evaporation and irrigation amount table 1 and the change in soil water fig 1 the 2012 results were lost due to a laboratory fault vitamin c including ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid is another nutritional quality index as it is involved in many metabolic reactions in human body lee and kader 2000 various studies have shown that water deficit generally leads to an increase in vc dumas et al 2003 favati et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 although its synthetic pathways and the associated regulation are obscured wheeler et al 1998 lee and kader 2000 a positive relationship between vc and tss was found in our experiments and vc was also linked to sugar content because sugar is a precursor of vc biosynthesis wheeler et al 1998 our results suggested that the enhanced sugar accumulation due to reduced irrigation should have boosted vc synthesis vc and fruit size were negatively correlated agreeing with previous study favati et al 2009 sunlight is believed to be the mechanisms underlying the response of vc to irrigation dumas et al 2003 because water deficit reduced the leaf area index and thus enhanced light intensity in the canopy upregulating vitamin c synthesis wang et al 2011 4 3 the optimal irrigation scheduling fruit quality is an important factor for determining irrigation scheduling despite the difficulty associated with its quantification wang et al 2011 our results showed that different food quality indices responded to irrigation scheduling differently suggesting that in addition to irrigation other factors might also play a part in altering the metabolic reactions within the crop although a slight water stress can improve nutritional quality severe drought would reduce fruit size and cause blossom end rot due to the decrease in calcium uptake pulupol et al 1996 resulting in defect in visual quality fruit quality has many attributes which are expensive to measure for tomato we found that its fruit quality can be characterized by tss ssc vc and organic acids wang et al 2011 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 reasonably well tss is positively correlated to the comprehensive quality score calculated by pca fig 6 as tss is relatively easy and cheap to measure it can be used as a proxy for comprehensive quality of the tomato optimal irrigation scheduling needs to consider yield fruit quality and water use efficiency however finding a right balance between them is a challenge due to the complex interaction they involve in as such analyzing their quantitative relationship is needed our results showed that topsis is capable of estimating optimal irrigation frequency and amount by best balancing yield fruit quality and water use efficiency of greenhouse tomato for our experiment the combination of irrigation frequency and amount at i 1 k cp2 gave the best comprehensive result table 7 and it is the most rational irrigation schedule for tomato production in solar greenhouse in north china plain 5 conclusions this paper tests the feasibility of using evaporation measured from a standard 20 cm pan as a reference to determine optimal irrigation scheduling to best balance yield fruit quality and water use efficiency of greenhouse tomato we present a method to quantify fruit quality and conducted experiment under different combinations of irrigation amount and frequency to test the method the result showed that when the irrigation amount was the same under drip irrigation increasing irrigation frequency could significantly boost yield wue and some nutritional quality indices of the tomato although it had no noticeable impact on water consumption when the irrigation frequency was the same reducing irrigation amount led to an increase in nutritional and storage qualities excessive irrigation or deficit irrigation reduced tomato yield and wue the yield and wue of the tomato peaked when the irrigation amount reached 90 and 70 of ae respectively the tss was closely related to the comprehensive fruit quality scores calculated using pca analysis of all experimental data using topsis revealed that the irrigation scheduling i 1 k cp2 was the optimal best balancing the yield fruit quality and wue of the tomato studied in this work declaration of competing interest the authors

10834,vegetable production in many countries relies on irrigation while increasing irrigation amount normally improves yield too much water could jeopardize fruit quality and comprise profit optimizing irrigation frequency and amount is thus essential to ensuring yield increase without compromising fruit quality this paper presents a three year 2011 2013 experimental study on responsive changes in yield fruit quality and water use efficiency wue of tomato grown in greenhouse to different irrigation frequency and amount under drip irrigation the irrigation scheduling was based on accumulative evaporation ae measured from a standard 20 cm pan three irrigation frequencies were considered in which irrigation was resumed when ae was 10 mm i 1 20 mm i 2 and 30 mm i 3 respectively each frequency was associated with four irrigation amounts which were 50 k cp1 70 k cp2 90 k cp3 and 110 k cp4 of ae respectively water consumption yield characteristics and fruit quality of the plants in each treatment were measured the three year results show that for each irrigation amount increasing irrigation frequency led to an increase in yield and wue visual fruit quality traits including average weight longitudinal and transverse diameter increased with irrigation amount but not with irrigation frequency it was found that a reduction in irrigation amount increased all other fruit quality characteristics except the sugar organic acid ratio in 2013 both yield and wue increased asymptotically with irrigation amount before approaching their plateau when the irrigation amount reached 90 and 70 of ae respectively while the yield was positively related to fruit size and negatively to soluble solid content it was independent of wue the results from technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution analysis revealed that among all treatments i 1 k cp2 was the optimal in terms of best balancing yield fruit quality and water use efficiency principal component analysis found that the comprehensive fruit quality score was closely related to the total soluble solids content keywords irrigation frequency and amount tomato yield water use efficiency fruit quality comprehensive evaluation 1 introduction tomato is a staple commercial vegetable grown mainly in greenhouse in many countries to bridge the seasonal gap in its production yuan et al 2001 liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 it is rich in phytonutrients including lycopene β carotene and vitamin c and is hence beneficial to reducing the risk of various cancers favati et al 2009 rosales et al 2011 as living standard has been rising the demand for tomato has shifted from quantity to quality chen et al 2013 the nutrient contents in tomato depend not only on its genetic origin but also on the environment in which it grows dumas et al 2003 rosales et al 2011 improving cultivational practices especially irrigation liu et al 2013 can therefore offer an alternative to improve fruit yield and quality drip irrigation can deliver water and nutrients to desirable root zone and has hence become the dominant irrigation method in greenhouse production compared with traditional border and furrow irrigation drip irrigation reduces water loss from evapotranspiration and percolation thereby saving water and fertilizers under certain circumstances it can even reduce soil degradation and salinity yohannes and tadesse 1998 hanson and may 2004 mahajan and singh 2006 irrigation frequency and amount are two design parameters in irrigation scheduling uçan et al 2007 sezen et al 2008 liu et al 2013 çolak et al 2018 because excessive irrigation could result in anoxic spots and impeding oxygen diffusion while inadequate irrigation might lead to water stress suppressing crop growth mitchell et al 1991 sezen et al 2008 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 2014 du et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the impact of irrigation frequency and amount on crop growth varies with region and crop varieties existing study on impact of irrigation frequency on vegetable production is inconclusive with some showing that under the same irrigation amount increasing frequency does benefit yield and water use efficiency wue of crops such as potato melon bell pepper and green beans sezen et al 2006 wang et al 2006 sensoy et al 2007 sezen et al 2008 çolak et al 2018 due to the improved soil environment while others showing no or even adverse impact for crops such as cucumber ertek et al 2006a radish wan and kang 2006 sesame uçan et al 2007 and blueberry holzapfel et al 2015 the efficacy of irrigation scheduling in improving crop production depends on soil moisture content there has been an increase in use of remote sensors to monitor soil moisture content over the past decade but direct use of these sensors in irrigation design is still in its infancy because the inherent heterogeneity of soil and the point based nature of the sensors could make the measurements unrepresentative wan and kang 2006 qiu et al 2013 yan et al 2019 as such alternative methods have been used as a proxy for evapotranspiration including evaporation measured from pans to design irrigation scheduling of both drip and sprinkler irrigation for a wide variety of crops grown in both field and greenhouse yuan et al 2003 2004 liu and kang 2006 wan and kang 2006 junzeng et al 2008 wang et al 2009 zeng et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zuo et al 2016 du et al 2017 wang et al 2017 because the evaporation measured from a pan differs from water consumed by crop their relationship has been intensively studied for a variety of crops under various environments yuan et al 2001 sensoy et al 2007 liu et al 2013 soil water mediates transformations of plant nutrients and their uptake by roots and irrigation therefore impacts fruit quality however there is no standardized protocol to quantify fruit quality the commonly used method in the literature is to compare the visual appearance nutritional quality taste and storage qualities for processing of the fruit wang et al 2015 with each characterized by a number of indices for example the nutritional quality could be represented by carotenoid lycopene vc sugar organic acid and protein while the visual appearance can be quantified by fruit size and color wang et al 2011 qiu et al 2017 over the past few years a variety of methods have been proposed to comprehensively assess fruit quality and its relationship with water including principal component analysis pca analytic hierarchy process ahp gray relational analysis gra and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis wang et al 2011 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 measuring fruit quality indices especially the nutritional indices however is time consuming and labor intensive difficult to access by farmers a natural question is thus if some indices can be made redundant without compromising assessment result also quality assessment needs to consider profitability as boosting yield by solely increasing irrigation amount could compromise fruit quality and result in a profit loss luo and li 2018 the multi objective decision making method topsis provide a solution to this topsis calculates the comprehensive benefits by evaluating the relative similarity between different objects as well as the positive and negative ideal solutions luo and li 2018 it has been used to estimate benefit of greenhouse tomato production liu et al 2013 luo and li 2018 the feasibility of using the evaporation measured from pan as a proxy for evapotranspiration to determine irrigation frequency and amount sezen et al 2008 liu et al 2013 has been investigated previously based on subjective analysis and experimental data evaluation however the variation in experience and perspective between decision makers could give rise to biased verdict therefore methods able to comprehensively determine optimal irrigation frequency and amount for greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation is needed in order to ameliorate the deficiency of the commonly used subjective evaluation method considering the limited study in this area the purpose of this paper is to present a method to quantify the effect of drip irrigation frequency and amount on yield fruit quality and water use efficiency of tomato farmers concern profitability and consumers care about fruit quality as both are affected by soil water dynamics we hypothesize that it is possible to design an optimal irrigation scheduling for crop which is capable of best balancing its yield fruit quality and water use efficiency we tested this by taking tomato grown in greenhouse as an example the plants were drip irrigated under different irrigation amounts and frequencies and the data measured from the experiment were used to compare the benefits of all treatments using topsis from which the optimal irrigation scheduling was obtained 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse from 2011 to 2013 at the experimental station of farmland irrigation research institute at xinxiang henan province of china latitude 35 19 n longitude 113 53 e altitude 73 2 m the annual mean air temperature and duration of sunshine is 13 5 c and 2497 h respectively with 220 frost free days the annual mean precipitation and potential evaporation over the past 50 years on the site was 580 mm and 2000 mm respectively the greenhouse was 40 m 8 5 m covered by a fogging resistance polyethylene film with a planting area of 272 3 m2 there was no heating system and thermal preservation was achieved by covering quilts over the polyethylene film during earlier spring the interior temperature was controlled by roof vents the depth of groundwater table on the site is more than 5 m and the soil is fluvo aquic eutyic cambisols with a sandy loam texture usda soil classification system the bulk density and field capacity of the soil was 1 38 g cm 3 and 24 mass water content respectively the mean permanent wilting point of the 0 100 cm soil was 8 mass water content soil available n p and k were 45 3 3 2 and 91 2 mg kg 1 respectively and the organic matter in the 0 60 cm soil was 31 3 g kg 1 2 2 experimental design and management compound fertilizer consisting of 70 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg p2o5 ha 1 together with 130 kg ha 1 of k2o and 25 t ha 1 of chicken dung was broadcasted over the soil surface as base fertilizer prior to ploughing with a rotary spader to 16 cm deep seeds of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv jingding were germinated in a seedbed and healthy seedlings were transplanted to the greenhouse on march 14 in 2011 march 30 in 2012 and march 28 in 2013 when the fifth leaf emerged each plot was 7 5 m 1 1 m into which 50 seedlings were planted in two rows spaced by 40 cm with an intra row plant distance of 30 cm adjacent plots were separated by a 10 cm wide ridge and the inter plot row distance was 70 cm to ensure plant survival after the transplantation each plot was irrigated with an equal amount of water 46 3 mm in 2011 45 mm in 2012 and 2013 to bring the 0 40 cm soil water content to 90 of the field capacity the treatment started when the average 0 40 cm soil water content dropped to 70 of the field capacity the irrigation frequencies were determined based on the accumulative evaporation ae measured from a 20 cm pan not a standard pan worldwide but recommended in china for measuring evaporation as a reference the pan was mounted in the greenhouse above the canopy and irrigation was resumed when the ae measured daily at 8 00 a m using a glass graduated flask reached 10 2 mm i 1 20 2 mm i 2 and 30 2 mm i 3 respectively each irrigation frequency was associated with four irrigation amounts 50 k cp1 70 k cp2 90 k cp3 and 110 k cp4 of ae overall there were 12 treatments each having three replications arranged randomly in split plots the total number of irrigation events wnum for each frequency and its associated four irrigation amounts are given in table 1 along with the average irrigation amount of each irrigation event the external diameter of the plastic drip irrigation strip was 16 mm and one strip was associated with one row of plant the intra strip emitter distance was 30 cm and the discharge rate of each emitter was 1 2 l h 1 operated by a constant pressure at 100 kpa there was a valve integrated with a pressure gauge for each plot to control irrigation and the operating pressure the irrigation amount for each plot was measured by a flow meter the plots were hydraulically isolated by plastic film to prevent lateral water flow three micro lysimeters 1 m x 1 m x 1 m were installed at different locations in the greenhouse to measure daily evapotranspiration and drainage the plants were pruned just above the fourth truss and the branch stems were also removed at their emergence stage tomato tone was sprayed once a week over the canopy from the onset of flowering stage in all treatments aimed to increase fruit setting ismail et al 2008 the plants in all treatments were top dressed three times during the fruiting stage via fertigation with the first two top dressings applying 30 kg ha 1 of urea each and the last one applying 20 kg ha 1 of urea other managements including weed removal disease and pest control were the same in all treatments the first fruit harvest was on may 27 in 2011 and 2012 and june 6 in 2013 when 90 of the fruits become red since then each plot was harvested twice a week 2 3 measurements and computational methods 2 3 1 soil moisture and water consumption gravimetric water content at 20 cm interval within 0 100 cm soil was measured by coring every 10 days from a site 15 cm away from a drip emitter in the intra row direction during the growth season ismail et al 2008 the irrigation amount w i m3 of each plot was calculated by ertek et al 2006b 1 w i 1 1000 a a e k where a is the area of the plot m2 ae is the accumulative evaporation measured from the 20 cm pan mm and k is the plant pan coefficient water consumption by the plant et mm was calculated using the following water balance equation allen 1998 yan et al 2018 2 e t p w i u r d w δ s where p is the effective precipitation mm w i is the irrigation amount mm u is water movement from deep soil into the root zone mm r is surface runoff mm d w is water percolation out of the root zone mm and s is the change in soil water within 0 100 cm soil mm precipitation downward soil water movement and surface runoff were negligible under drip irrigation in the greenhouse and the above equation can thus be simplified to qiu et al 2013 2015 3 e t w i δ s 2 3 2 fruit yield and water use efficiency red and disease free fruits from twenty plants in the middle of each plot were sampled to measure their marketable yield mean fruit weight and fruit diameter the weight of each tomato was measured using a scale with precision of 0 1 g and fruit diameter was measured using a vernier caliper water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation uçan et al 2007 qiu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 yang et al 2017 4 w u e y e t 100 where y is the marketable yield t ha 1 and et is the total evapotranspiration mm 2 3 3 fruit quality indices six fruits were selected randomly from each plot for food quality measurement at early middle and late harvesting stage the fruit firmness ff was measured by a hardometer gy 3 top hangzhou china the total soluble solids content tss was measured by a hand held refractometer with automatic temperature compensation pr 32α atago tokyo japan the vitamin c vc in ascorbic acid was calculated by the classical titration method with the 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenols sodium salt solution the soluble sugar content ssc was measured by anthrone method wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 organic acidity oa was titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh first and then calculated as equivalence of citric acid expressed as percentage of fresh mass wilson and walker 1976 soluble protein sp content was measured using coomassie brilliant blue and sugar acid ratio sar was determined by dividing the soluble sugar content in each plot by organic acidity in the plot 2 3 4 meteorological data the meteorological data were collected from a standard automatic weather station installed in the middle of the greenhouse to measure solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity throughout the growth season the monthly mean solar radiation air temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd are given in table 2 2 4 calculation of the comprehensive quality score with the principal component analysis pca comprehensive quality score of the tomato was evaluated with the pca it consists of the following six sequential steps wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 i constructing the original multiple quality parameter matrix 5 a a i j n p a 11 a 12 a 1 p a 21 a 22 a 2

used to analyze the yield wue and the fruit quality indices with the glm procedure in spss version 21 0 ibm corp armonk ny the mean values were compared for significance using the duncan s multiple range tests pca was employed to assess the association between fruit quality indices using canoco 5 ter braak 1989 topsis was solved using microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 changes in soil water content changes in 0 40 cm soil water content are compared in fig 1 for all treatments as anticipated soil water content increased with irrigation amount the impact of irrigation frequency on soil water varied with irrigation amount with the soil water content oscillating more under high irrigation amount than under low irrigation amount fig 1 if the plants were assumed to have suffered water stress when the 0 40 cm soil water content was below 70 of the field capacity increasing irrigation frequency delayed the water stress for example for irrigation frequency i 1 in 2011 water stress occurred on may 10 and 20 under k cp1and k cp2 respectively while the reduced irrigation frequency in i 2 and i 3 brought this to april 30 fig 1 also reveals that the 0 40 cm soil water content in all treatments never exceeded the field capacity 33 and deep percolation thus did not occur consistent with the measurements from the three lysimeters 3 2 the yield the yield was affected significantly p 0 05 by irrigation frequency i and amount k cp individually but not interactively by their combination table 3 when irrigation amount was the same increasing irrigation frequency benefited yield significantly compared with i 3 over the three seasons i 1 and i2 increased the average yield by 7 6 and 5 7 respectively yet no significant difference was found between i 1 and i 2 when the irrigation frequency was the same yield increased asymptotically with irrigation amount table 3 fig 2 compared with k cp4 over the three seasons k cp1 and k cp2 reduced the average yield by 25 4 and 5 3 respectively the average yields of k cp3 and k cp4 were comparable indicating that when the irrigation frequency was the same a further increase in irrigation amount from k cp3 did not give a noticeable increase in yield it was also found that the yield in 2011 and 2012 was 15 2 and 12 1 respectively lower than that in 2013 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency irrigation amount significantly affected the water consumption whereas there was no noticeable difference in water consumption between different irrigation frequencies when the irrigation amount was the same fig 3 water consumption increased with irrigation amount compared with k cp4 over the three seasons k cp1 k cp2 and k cp3 reduced the average water consumption by 30 7 20 3 and 12 4 respectively water consumption in 2011 and 2012 was comparable but fell significantly in 2013 due to the drop in evaporation manifest by the accumulative evaporation measured from the pan which in 2011 and 2012 was 11 1 and 10 4 respectively higher than that in 2013 fig 3 both irrigation frequency and amount affected wue p 0 05 although their interactive effect on yield was insignificant except in 2011 compared with i 3 over the three years the irrigation frequency i 1 and i 2 increased the average wue by 5 7 and 4 2 respectively table 3 again there was no significant difference in wue between i 1 and i 2 irrigation amount k cp2 gave the highest wue in 2011 and 2012 but it was comparable with k cp3 in 2013 showing that a further increase in irrigation amount from k cp2 did not lead to a noticeable increase in wue fig 4 in addition wue peaked in 2013 due to the increased yield and reduced water consumption figs 2 and 3 the average wue in 2013 increased by 29 1 and 25 8 respectively compared to that in 2011 and 2012 3 4 fruit quality table 4 shows the fruit quality indices for all treatments visual quality indices such as mean fruit weight mfw longitudinal diameter ld and transverse diameter td increased steadily with irrigation amount but not with irrigation frequency except mfw in 2013 the impact of irrigation frequency and amount on other fruit quality indices varied with seasons in different ways for example an increase in irrigation frequency improved tss vc and fruit firmness ff significantly but not for tss in 2013 irrigation frequency and amount did not interactively alerted tss vc and ff but significantly affected tss in 2012 and vc in 2013 the results also showed that irrigation amount had a marked effect on ssc in 2012 and 2013 whereas irrigation frequency had a significant effect on ssc in 2011 irrigation frequency and amount did not interactively impact ssc oa sugar acid ratio sar and soluble protein content sp among the 24 quality indices obtained from the split plot anova 23 except sar in 2013 were affected by irrigation amount 13 responded to irrigation frequency yet only three felt the impact of irrigation frequency and amount simultaneously at significant level 3 5 relationship between fruit quality indices the correlations between the fruit quality indices in the three years are approximately the same and we hence only present the 2013 results table 5 there was a positive correlation between all visual quality indices mfw was independent of sar but negatively correlated to tss vc ssc oa sp and ff tss was positively correlated to all nutritious and storage quality indices but not to sar these confirmed that the impact of irrigation scheduling on nutritional quality and storage quality indices i e fruit firmness was consistent and that tss can be used as an indicator for both nutritional quality and storage quality notice however that tss was negatively related to visual fruit quality indices and that irrigation scheduling affected visual quality and nutritional quality of the fruits in different ways 3 6 comprehensive quality evaluated by pca the variance contribution of the first and second principal component was 81 9 and 11 1 respectively fig 5 and the accumulative variance contribution was 93 0 these two principal components explain most variance information in the original quality data and can represent the 10 fruit comprehensive quality indices the first component reflects the impact of tss ssc oa vc and sp which have large factor loading values and represent the nutritional quality the second component reflects the impact of sar ff and td which respectively represent flavor storage and visual quality of the fruit and have large factor loading values the comprehensive fruit quality scores for different treatments are shown in table 6 i 1 k cp1 had the highest score giving the optimal comprehensive quality and i 2 k cp4 is the worst a positive correlation r2 0 9817 between tss and the comprehensive quality scores was found at significant level fig 6 eliciting that tss represents the comprehensive fruit quality 3 7 balance between yield fruit quality and water use efficiency tss can be used as an indicator for comprehensive quality the comprehensive benefit in the calculation considered the balance between yield fruit quality and water use efficiency the results are shown in table 7 in the analysis a ranking score for each year was assigned and the results in 2011 and 2013 were consistent in which i 1 k cp2 was the optimal irrigation scheduling with its ci value being 0 788 and 0 746 respectively the optimal irrigation scheduling in 2012 was i 1 k cp3 but it differed from i 1 k cp2 marginally with its ci value increasing only by 2 2 averaged over the three years i 1 k cp2 had the highest ci value at 0 746 giving the optimal comprehensive benefit and best balancing the yield fruit quality and water use efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 effect on yield and wue irrigation is the only way to replenish the soil water taken up by crop in greenhouse chen et al 2014 the effect of irrigation on plant growth and fruit quality depends on timing and amount of the irrigation when total irrigation amount is the same increasing irrigation frequency can keep the water within a small volume of soil in the root zone to promote root growth and facilitate root uptake of resources kang et al 2004 wang et al 2006 it hence improves the transfer of nutrients and photosynthetic products to reproductive organs wang et al 2006 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 and increases fruit number as a result liu et al 2013 the improved yield as irrigation frequency increased in our experiment was mainly due to the increased fruit number liu et al 2013 rather than the weight of individual fruit table 4 consistent with previous studies on tomato pires et al 2011 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 and other crops such as bell pepper sezen et al 2006 and melon sensoy et al 2007 the improved wue due to irrigation frequency increase was ascribed to the increased yield fig 2 and table 3 as there was only a minor difference in water consumption between different irrigation frequencies fig 3 reducing irrigation amount compromised yield in all three seasons because tomato is a water demanding crop chen et al 2014 and sensitive to water stress especially during flowering and fruit setting stage flowering and fruit setting occur concurrently as new trusses develop pulupol et al 1996 and the occurrence of a water stress could thus reduce fruit number and fruit weight liu et al 2013 the reduction in yield due to water stress was caused by dwindled fruit number and reduced fruit weight table 4 agreeing with previous findings pulupol et al 1996 favati et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 our results showed that severe water deficit or excessive irrigation reduced wue although a slight water stress could facilitate wue fig 4 and table 3 the finding that the maximum wue was not associated with the minimum irrigation amount is due to that the increased water stress suppressed plant growth and thereby reduced its ultimate yield table 3 consistent with previous studies on tomato potato and eggplant kang et al 2004 ertek et al 2006b cantore et al 2016 similarly the minimum wue was not associated with the maximum irrigation amount because it enhanced non productive transpiration table 3 confirming that increasing irrigation amount benefits yield but not water use efficiency cantore et al 2016 du et al 2017 the high yield in 2013 is probably because vpd in 2013 was lower than that in 2011 and 2012 table 2 which reduced water accumulation and resulted in a relative increase in the dry weight within the fruit rosales et al 2011 and a decrease in fresh weight table 4 although the irrigation amount in 2013 was less than that in 2011 and 2012 the reduced water consumption by crop coupled with a rise in yield led to an increase in wue fig 4 4 2 effects on fruit quality indices soil water mediates nutrients transformation in soil and their uptake by plant roots it therefore has a direct link with food quality it is the irrigation amount rather than irrigation frequency that markedly impacted fruit size table 4 in general the growth of a fruit during its ripening stage largely depends on photosynthetic capacity and or the distribution of photoassimilates between different plant tissues rodriguez ortega et al 2017 increasing irrigation frequency can ameliorate water stress fig 1 and thus facilitates production and transfer of photosynthetic products in the form of sucrose to reproductive organs which is evident in the improved fruit ssc observed in our experiment although the improvement is not always significant as an important quality index tss represents the proportion of the dissolved solids in solution which in the tomato fruit pulp comprises 65 sugars sucrose and hexoses 13 acids citrate and malate and 12 other minor components including phenols amino acids soluble pectins ascorbic acid and minerals kader 2008 chen et al 2014 the proportion of ssc and organic acidity in tss were 55 and 11 respectively table 4 alluding to that increasing irrigation frequency might have boosted the production of tss yet it was found that tss ssc and organic acidity all increased inversely with irrigation amount under water deficit the translocation of phloem sap to fruit was impeded and the solute concentration in the sap therefore increased this could reduce water flow from the xylem to fruit mitchell et al 1991 guichard et al 2001 which with the accumulation of sugars and acids unaffected led to an increase in their concentration in the fruit and a consequent improvement in fruit quality mitchell et al 1991 chen et al 2014 in addition water stress boosted starch accumulation in immature fruits mitchell et al 1991 and facilitated starch translocation into the hexose within the mature fruits thereby increasing tss and ssc in the fruit wang et al 2011 fruit flavor depends on aroma components malundo et al 1995 and the taste is largely determined by the contents of sugar solution and organic acids as well as their ratio kader 2008 the 2011 results were consistent with these however there was a slight increase in sugar acid ratio in 2013 indicating that the relative sugar and organic acids content was independent of irrigation in 2013 table 4 due to the reduced evaporation and irrigation amount table 1 and the change in soil water fig 1 the 2012 results were lost due to a laboratory fault vitamin c including ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid is another nutritional quality index as it is involved in many metabolic reactions in human body lee and kader 2000 various studies have shown that water deficit generally leads to an increase in vc dumas et al 2003 favati et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 although its synthetic pathways and the associated regulation are obscured wheeler et al 1998 lee and kader 2000 a positive relationship between vc and tss was found in our experiments and vc was also linked to sugar content because sugar is a precursor of vc biosynthesis wheeler et al 1998 our results suggested that the enhanced sugar accumulation due to reduced irrigation should have boosted vc synthesis vc and fruit size were negatively correlated agreeing with previous study favati et al 2009 sunlight is believed to be the mechanisms underlying the response of vc to irrigation dumas et al 2003 because water deficit reduced the leaf area index and thus enhanced light intensity in the canopy upregulating vitamin c synthesis wang et al 2011 4 3 the optimal irrigation scheduling fruit quality is an important factor for determining irrigation scheduling despite the difficulty associated with its quantification wang et al 2011 our results showed that different food quality indices responded to irrigation scheduling differently suggesting that in addition to irrigation other factors might also play a part in altering the metabolic reactions within the crop although a slight water stress can improve nutritional quality severe drought would reduce fruit size and cause blossom end rot due to the decrease in calcium uptake pulupol et al 1996 resulting in defect in visual quality fruit quality has many attributes which are expensive to measure for tomato we found that its fruit quality can be characterized by tss ssc vc and organic acids wang et al 2011 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 reasonably well tss is positively correlated to the comprehensive quality score calculated by pca fig 6 as tss is relatively easy and cheap to measure it can be used as a proxy for comprehensive quality of the tomato optimal irrigation scheduling needs to consider yield fruit quality and water use efficiency however finding a right balance between them is a challenge due to the complex interaction they involve in as such analyzing their quantitative relationship is needed our results showed that topsis is capable of estimating optimal irrigation frequency and amount by best balancing yield fruit quality and water use efficiency of greenhouse tomato for our experiment the combination of irrigation frequency and amount at i 1 k cp2 gave the best comprehensive result table 7 and it is the most rational irrigation schedule for tomato production in solar greenhouse in north china plain 5 conclusions this paper tests the feasibility of using evaporation measured from a standard 20 cm pan as a reference to determine optimal irrigation scheduling to best balance yield fruit quality and water use efficiency of greenhouse tomato we present a method to quantify fruit quality and conducted experiment under different combinations of irrigation amount and frequency to test the method the result showed that when the irrigation amount was the same under drip irrigation increasing irrigation frequency could significantly boost yield wue and some nutritional quality indices of the tomato although it had no noticeable impact on water consumption when the irrigation frequency was the same reducing irrigation amount led to an increase in nutritional and storage qualities excessive irrigation or deficit irrigation reduced tomato yield and wue the yield and wue of the tomato peaked when the irrigation amount reached 90 and 70 of ae respectively the tss was closely related to the comprehensive fruit quality scores calculated using pca analysis of all experimental data using topsis revealed that the irrigation scheduling i 1 k cp2 was the optimal best balancing the yield fruit quality and wue of the tomato studied in this work declaration of competing interest the authors
