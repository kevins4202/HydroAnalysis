13865,a long short term memory lstm based neural network was proposed and developed to predict the ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiency of an anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a a o mbr system after data visualization using python programming the influent wastewater characteristics including total organic contents nh4 n tn tp chemical oxygen demand suspended solids and operating parameters such as dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential and mixed liquor suspended solids were considered as inputs while removal efficiency was taken as an output parameter first data analysis and its normalization were conducted to improve the learning speed of the model performance criteria of the proposed model were evaluated based on statistical values including the mean square error mse and root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr based on the goodness of fit values the proposed lstm model achieved good performance in the testing dataset calculation results deviated little indicated by the mse values of 0 0047 0 015 and 0 018 for nh4 n tn and tp and rsr values of 0 0104 0 129 and 0 141 respectively the proposed lstm model predicted the most precise removal efficiency for nh4 n of a a o mbr system while tn and tp predictions were comparatively less accurate but still acceptable the proposed lstm model is promising for predicting the nutrient removal efficiency of the a a o mbr system in real time and can aid in establishing process control strategies therefore the proposed lstm model is an adequate

total nitrogen total phosphorus 1 introduction the pollution of water bodies by nutrients is currently one of the greatest environmental challenges it is largely attributed to the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds discharged from anthropogenic activities or natural processes also known as eutrophication 1 the continuous increase in anthropogenic activities caused by the discharge of wastewater treatment plants runoff from urban areas and agricultural sites and the burning of fossil fuels 2 the nutrient based pollutants result in changes in the color taste odor opacity biodiversity and cause the depletion of oxygen in water resource 3 the nutrients must be removed from wastewater before it is discharged to the environment previous studies have explored various techniques including chemical biological and membrane technologies for removing nutrients from wastewater 4 6 in chemical treatment the precipitation of nutrients is proportional to the amount of chemical used and increases the sludge production 4 conventional biological techniques are unable to meet effluent standards for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp 7 bio electrochemical can be an option for the recovery of ammonium nitrogen and removal of phosphorous but present energy recovery is too low in this process 8 for nutrients recovery membrane integrated with chemical and biological technique is a promising method capable to increase the economic and technical feasibility of the process 9 the literature review showed that the anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a a o mbr have achieved good results in biological nutrient removal and the step feed anoxic oxic process was also successfully applied to remove nutrients 10 11 moreover an anoxic oxic step feed process with floating plastic carriers in aerobic units improved the nutrient removal efficiency re of the existing wastewater treatment plant 12 therefore in our proposed paper we investigated the a a o mbr system for the removal of nutrients at a full scale wastewater plant the a a o mbr is a complex biological treatment system the efficiency of nutrients removal in the a a o mbr system can be optimized by controllable parameters the single factor based experimental and mathematical mechanistic conventional modeling techniques have mostly been used to control and optimize the wastewater treatment systems 13 14 however the relationship between parameters has not yet been fully explored in previous researches the conventional modeling techniques required a series of experiments to be conducted which is a laborious expensive and time consuming task 15 and unable to model complex mechanisms 16 hence optimization of nutrients re in the a a o mbr system via conventional modeling techniques is difficult because of the complex and non linear behavior of a system the comprehensive and adaptive modeling techniques including machine learning and data driven artificial neural networks anns can resolve the challenges encountered in conventional modeling techniques 17 ann based modeling approaches have recently received more attention due to their prediction capability in real time applications ann models can efficiently learn non linear and complex biological wastewater treatment systems as compared to the mathematical models 18 previous researches have demonstrated that ann and response surface methodology rsm models are mostly used to extract information from input datasets and define complex relationships without any in depth understanding of the removal mechanisms in environmental engineering applications 19 20 in a recent study an ann back propagation bp model successfully traced the nitrogen re of a partial nitritation process and also predicted the nutrient removal of tidal flow constructed wetlands 21 22 besides annbp predicted the performance of expanded granular sludge bed reactor with superior predictive accuracy 23 and modeled polymeric inclusion membrane process for heavy metals removal efficiently 24 25 modeling of micellar enhanced ultrafiltration for mercury and arsenic removal from simulated wastewater by ann presented good results 26 27 ann and decision tree models projected the odor properties of post fermentation sludge with satisfactory results 28 ann with genetic algorithms optimized biogas process to predict methane production with a correlation coefficient of 0 87 29 and ann model forecasted biogas and methane production at up flow anaerobic sludge blanket pilot plant with best predictive results 30 multilayer anns with a genetic algorithm presented a high consistency between the experimental data and model predictions for the removal of chlorophenol from wastewater using the ro technique 31 the effluent quality of the iceas sequential batch reactor was predicted using feedforward anns that help to optimize treatment quality and increases the performance of a plant 32 anns model successfully traced the relationship of nutrients in electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor for wastewater treatment 33 and predicted cod re of multi stage biological treatment for petroleum refinery wastewater 34 the a a o nutrient removal process of a full scale wastewater treatment system has been optimized using a support vector machine and accelerating genetic algorithm 35 additionally a q learning based method was used to optimize a biological phosphorus removal system with an influent response control strategy 13 the anns have been frequently used in wastewater treatment systems 16 previously anns models have not been applied in the modeling of a a o mbr to predict nutrient re although various radial based ann models have been deployed for wastewater treatment systems however no studies have been conducted to address the vanishing gradient problem of radial based ann models the deep learning technique known as long short term memory units lstm can resolve the vanishing gradient problem 36 a literature review shows that an optimal deep learning lstm model predicted electric load 37 successfully applied in the flood forecasting 38 and an intensified lstm based recurrent neural network was used in rainfall prediction 39 by literature review the lstm based modeling technique to predict the nutrient re of the a a o mbr system has not been explored yet in this research we proposed the lstm based deep learning model to predict the re of nutrients our proposed model predicts the precise re for ammonium nh4 n and acceptable results for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp of the a a o mbr system and can be used in real time predictions our model can aid in establishing process control strategies with an adequate interpolation ability to predict the nutrient re of the a a o mbr system at a full scale wastewater treatment plant this work aims to i analyze dataset for preprocessing before training of the lstm model ii train the lstm model to predict the nutrients re of the a a o mbr system iii test the proposed lstm model with an unseen dataset to evaluate its accuracy 2 methodology 2 1 wastewater treatment plant wwtp description in this study the one year performance of an anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a a o mbr for removing nutrients such as nh4 n tn and tp at the okcheon sewage treatment plant republic of korea was monitored the sewage treatment plant consists of a primary sedimentation tank anaerobic anoxic and oxic membrane reactors and a clarifier as shown in the diagram presented in fig 1 the sedimentation tank collects the influent increases the hydrolysis and acidification of the particulate matter present in the wastewater and provides a constant flow to the anaerobic reactor mixers were used in the anaerobic and anoxic reactors to enhance the system efficiency and meet the throughput specifications of the microorganism by affecting the reaction kinetics the membrane bioreactor mbr was constructed from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and had a total membrane surface area of 64 000 m2 and a nominal pore size of 0 4 μm the mbr consists of several hollow fiber membrane modules placed in the oxic reactor with diffusers to maintain the do concentration which was measured by an online sensor in the mbr membrane filtration through a suction pump was conducted in continuous operation once the trans membrane pressure tmp exceeded 40 kpa the membrane module was removed from the reactor and cleaned with water and a 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution additionally the mlss concentration of the oxic mbr was measured to maintain a specific limit physio chemical and biological characteristics including total organic contents toc tn tp chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and suspended solids ss and operating parameters such as dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were monitored at wwtp the assessment of biodegradability at wwtp is of primary interest that directs to choose physiochemical or biological treatment processes a relationship between toc cod and ss can provide important information regarding oxidizable matter 40 nitrogen and phosphorous based nutrients are of great concern due to their dreadful effect on the environment 41 in addition controllable operating parameters such as do orp and mlss plays an important role in wastewater treatment therefore all these parameters were considered in this study to establish a relationship between them and the re of nutrients in the a a o mbr system 2 2 analytical methods the temperature ph do and orp were measured using online sensors and recorded for every hour of operation the toc and tn contents were also measured using an online analyzer shimaz toc l the tp cod nh4 n ss and mlss contents were measured following standard water and wastewater analysis methods 42 each parameter was monitored and recorded hourly measurements throughout the one year study 2 3 dataset and preprocessing the dataset was obtained from a sewage wastewater treatment plant at okcheon in the republic of korea for one year of plant operation wastewater characteristics are mainly divided into three classes such as physical chemical and biological although several parameters are monitored at wastewater treatment plants in this study influent characteristics including total organic contents toc tn tp chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and suspended solids ss and operating parameters such as the dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the influent wastewater quality indicators such as toc tn tp cod nh4 n and ss and operating parameters including do orp and mlss were considered as the input parameters while the re of nh4 n tn and tp were taken as the output parameters for the lstm model data analysis is an important step in machine learning and the development of artificial intelligence models therefore we first analyzed the operational and experimental datasets available for the training of the lstm model the preliminary data analysis aided the identification of trends patterns and anomalies of the dataset that is an important step in modeling it confirmed the wide range and non normal distribution of the dataset as shown in figs 2 and 3 input parameters ranges such as toc 0 06 101 72 tn 5 18 44 21 tp 0 63 6 05 cod 20 31 311 62 nh4 n 0 11 35 15 ss 0 83 161 25 do 0 02 6 30 orp 57 28 11 00 and mlss 2208 33 19976 00 output parameters were ranged as nh4 n 2 39 99 99 tn 15 98 93 86 tp 7 21 100 it is clear from trends of the input parameters that they have a wide range particularly the mlss content while the same scenario with output parameters along with a noisiness problem in the nh4 n data at the start that may be due to the measurement error moreover the lstm model is a recurrent neural network trained to resolve the gradient vanishing problem by using the backpropagation algorithm studies indicated that lstm models are sensitive to the randomization of the dataset particularly when non linear activation functions are used and the dataset should be normalized within the range of 0 1 therefore both the input and target datasets were normalized by systematic weight initialization to speed up the learning process resulting in faster convergence 37 39 the normalization of the dataset can address the issues of a wider range in input and output datasets the statistical analysis results of the influent characteristics of the wastewater and operating parameters are shown in table 1 several techniques can be applied to normalize a dataset including the min max technique and z score decimal scaling 43 44 in this study we used the most common min max normalization technique for data preprocessing within the range of 0 1 as described in eq 1 normalization changes the values in a dataset to a common scale without misrepresenting the differences in the ranges of the values as shown in table 2 the dataset can be easily normalized using the minmaxscaler preprocessing class from the scikit learn library in python programming 1 x x m i n a m a x a m i n a 2 4 long short term memory lstm network the long short term memory unit lstm network 45 is a descendant of the recurrent neural network rnn 46 it was proposed as a solution to the gradient explosion problem because of time intervals while back propagated error during the learning process on the rnn model network lstm networks predict an activity label at each time step there could be any number of previous time steps combined to predict an activity label the lstm model network is known to be an influential model in the past and shows learning capabilities from sequential data it can capture long term dependencies and efficiently learn from fluctuating length sequences fig 4 shows the lstm model unit the lstm unit has three gates these gates are responsible for controlling information flow the input gate is used to decide whether the input is significant enough to remember or not forget gate is used to decide when the lstm unit continue to memorize or forget the value the output gate is used to decide the output value from the lstm unit a standard lstm unit i consist a i as input of the unit and b i as the output of the unit b i t a n h a i the activation function is applied to a i the result was multiplied by b τ the inner activation b ω added for recurrent connection and results get scaled the factors b τ b φ b ω 0 1 are represented by white circles and controlled by input forget and output gates are represented by pink circles gating units add the previous layer activations and current layer activations the resulting value is squashed by sigmoid function and set to b τ b φ o r b ω 2 5 data preparation data preparation before feeding to a model is an important step in machine learning techniques input parameters including influent wastewater characteristics and operating parameters such as the toc tn tp cod nh4 n ss do orp and mlss were obtained as experimental data the removal of three important nutrients i e nh4 n tn and tp was investigated to evaluate the efficiency of the a a o mbr system at a full scale wastewater treatment plant the statistics of normalized input and output datasets are presented in table 2 output dataset plotted again by considering all three parameters including re of nh4 n tn and tp to show the trend after normalization as shown in fig 5 the output dataset of the first 1000 values are noisy particularly for nh4 n and this cannot be resolved by normalization such noisiness causes a decrease in the learning efficiency of lstm models therefore we removed the first 1000 values from the input and output datasets to enhance the training and prediction capability of the proposed model it was noticed that the re of nh4 n output dataset showed the best trend that can be easily learned by a model however even after dropping the noisy first 1000 data rows the tp exhibits more fluctuation than tn it is anticipated that the prediction of nh4 n can be more accurate because there is less deviation from a mean value in the dataset in the final stage of data preparation we determined the correlation between the input parameters using pearson s correlation coefficient which is the best method to measure the association between variables as it is based on the covariance method 47 a heatmap of pearson s correlation coefficient values is shown in fig 6 pearson s correlation coefficient values indicate that all parameters were positively correlated excluding do and orp which were negatively correlated with the other parameters but positively correlated with one other therefore all parameters were considered for lstm modeling in this study the final normalized input and output datasets containing 1000 7876 rows used for lstm modeling the experimental dataset was divided into two main parts the first was used for model training and the second was used for model testing as the dataset was large we used the first 6000 rows out of which actually 5000 data rows used for training the model after dropping the first 1000 values and remaining data were used for validation to avoid the overfitting problem after tuning the hyperparameters and achieving the best results we used the remaining 1876 data rows 6000 7876 in the dataset as unseen data to predict the re of nh4 n tn and tp in the a a o mbr system in the training phase supervised learning was conducted by providing targeted results and during the testing step the proposed model was used to predict the re of the targeted nutrients as learned in the training step the proposed lstm model was developed by python programming using the pandas library 2 6 proposed model after dataset pre processing it is fed to our proposed lstm network our proposed deep learning model has two stacked lstm layers l1 and l2 and one dense layer as shown in fig 7 the input of 9 parameters along with 10 previous time steps are provided to 198 lstm units with a batch size of 340 hence the input shape is 340 199 after l1 the output shape changed to none 1 198 because of 198 lstm units in l1 the output of l1 is provided to l2 with 99 lstm units the output shape after l2 is changed to none 99 the l2 regularization ridge regression technique is used as a kernel regularizer recurrent regularizer and bias regularizer in l2 in order to prevent overfitting and underfitting of the model the dropout rate of 0 2 is applied after l2 the output of the l2 is provided to a dense layer there are 3 neurons used in a dense layer along with linear activation function the neuron in the dense layer predicts the 3 outputs of re nh4 n tn and tp the time step 0 means only the current data is used as an input time step 10 means the previous 9 data values and the current data are used as an input 2 7 model performance evaluation model performance evaluation aims to confirm the accuracy of the proposed and check any errors to allow it to be applied with confidence 48 49 in this study the mean square error mse and root mse observations standard deviation ratio rsr performance were used to evaluate the results predicted by the proposed model eq s 8 and 9 were used as performance measuring criteria when evaluating the model and are described below 50 the mse and rsr values range from 0 to 1 and lower values indicate a good correlation between the experimental and model predicted results 8 m s e 1 n i 1 n y e x p i x p r e i 2 9 r s r r m

m e a n is the mean of the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 hyper parameters selection for proposed lstm model the proposed lstm network is implemented using keras library with tensorflow as a backend the sequential model in keras is used to implement stacked lstm layers some hyper parameters affect the performance of the model batch size epoch number number of layers number of units per layer and number of the previous time steps in sequence typically after probing over 300 networks using various combinations of hyper parameters an optimum model and its corresponding optimum hyper parameters can be found the optimum number of lstm units in the hidden layer was determined using different topologies by varying the number of lstm units from 2 300 each topology was tested using a loss function as the error function and repeated three times to confirm the results we did perform the number of experiments to select optimal hyper parameters for our proposed network the two layered stacked lstm network is selected after careful experiments the batch size 340 epoch size 1000 previous time step 10 gives us the best training and validation accuracy results for our proposed lstm model the followings are the minor hyper parameters of the selected configuration the dropout rate of 0 2 is selected only once after the second lstm layer adding more dropout layers disturbs accuracy and loss trends similarly increasing or decreasing the dropout rate also disturb accuracy and loss trends the model achieved the best results when selecting the rectified linear unit relu as the activation function with the adam optimization algorithm adam optimizer is used during training with a learning rate of 0 0001 the learning rate is a hyper parameter that controls the overriding of old data with newly acquired data and is important in weight modification based on the loss gradient the smaller value for the learning rate showed better results 3 2 training and validation results of lstm model fig 8 shows the training loss and validation loss curves for proposed two layered lstm with l1 198 and l2 99 having epoch size 2000 batch size 340 and previous time step 10 the x axis shows the number of epochs the y axis shows the training loss and validation loss the losses are calculated in terms of mean square error mse the red color trend shows the validation loss while the yellow color trend shows the training loss it is shown that training and validation losses are decreasing normally and curves are starting to saturate from the epoch 600 and quite stable till epoch 1000 hence the lstm network is trained well and there is no over fitting and under fitting till 1000 the losses of the proposed network reach the lower mean square error mse at epoch 1000 according to the training and validation loss learning was best at approximately 1000 epochs after 1000 epochs onward the model began memorizing and caused overfitting as the training loss was below the validation loss initially the model learning ability was poor however it improved as the number of epochs increased and overfitting may have also been avoided using the early stopping technique and can also be addressed by using a moderate batch size and changing the drop out parameter even at an increased number of epochs table 3 shows the training and validation losses of the lstm model at optimum hyper parameters 3 3 prediction results after the successful training and validation of the lstm model we fed the testing data into the model containing 1876 rows and tested the reliability of the model for the unseen dataset the prediction results of the proposed model were evaluated based on the mse and rsr values a good fit between the experimental and predicted results can be achieved if the value of the mse is zero which is improbable the average mse values were 0 0047 0 015 and 0 018 for nh4 n tn and tp for the unseen testing dataset respectively mse of testing dataset for each nutrient is presented in fig 9 it indicated that the best model learning was achieved for nh4 n due to the consistency in the trend of the dataset however for the other nutrients the variations in the dataset were larger resulted in less accuracy comparatively therefore the model learning performance for these nutrients was poor as indicated by the mse values of the prediction results testing dataset for the testing dataset the average rsr values were 0 0104 0 129 and 0 141 respectively the mse and rsr of the predictive model demonstrated how effectively the nutrient re of the a a o mbr system can be predicted using the proposed lstm network the re prediction of the nh4 n was comparatively better than that of the tn and tp re though the prediction results of the tn and tp were also acceptable on the basis of mse and rsr values precisely collected data without wide deviation can be traced more easily by the lstm neural network model than statistical techniques which cannot effectively utilize a non linear dataset this can aid in determining the concentrations of nutrients in the effluent that will be discharged after treatment to allow decision makers to change the controllable parameters and maintain the effluent standards therefore our proposed network is a competent prediction model for the nutrient re of an a a o mbr system that can assist wastewater treatment systems and contribute to the environment and economy of a country the mse results indicated that the minimum values were observed in the prediction of nh4 n re of the a a o mbr system in addition rsr values also supported these results and demonstrated that the model could predict the nh4 n re best while the prediction results for other nutrients including tn and tp were also acceptable due to the accurate measurement of parameters during analysis therefore the results demonstrated that the lstm model can predict the nutrient removal efficiencies of wastewater treatment plants if an accurately measured dataset is fed to the model the experimental and predicted results are compared in the following section 3 4 comparison of actual and model predicted results the actual results and those predicted by the lstm model are compared in fig 10 to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed lstm model the predicted results particularly the re of nh4 n almost match the actual results though there were a few variations caused by large deviations in the dataset moreover the plots for the re of tn and tp exhibited satisfactory results when the unseen dataset was used for prediction some of the peaks or differences shown in the plots could be due to outliers which caused large deviations in the consecutive results the prediction technique attempts to either exclude those points or plot them by examining whether such outliers were present in the training step the proposed lstm model successfully traced the non linear behavior of the a a o mbr system in wastewater treatment therefore the application of lstm based neural networks may aid in the automation and control of the removal of the targeted pollutants in wastewater treatment plants if instruments are calibrated timely to avoid drift phenomena of a sensor 4 conclusion in this study a deep learning approach was followed to predict the re of important nutrients such as nh4 n tn and tp by an a a o mbr system data analysis showed the trend of input output datasets and the association between variables was studied an lstm based recurrent neural network was constructed considering the nutrient re against various influent characteristics and operating parameters including toc tn tp cod nh4 n ss do orp and mlss the predictive capability of the proposed model was best after tuning the hyper parameters with average mse values of 0 0047 0 015 and 0 018 for nh4 n tn and tp in the unseen testing dataset respectively and average rsr values of 0 0104 0 129 and 0 141 respectively in future work the predicted nutrient re results can aid in improving the a a o mbr system to meet the effluent discharge standards which is a major concern in wastewater treatment systems moreover the anticipated concentration of nutrients in the effluent can be predicted using a real time dataset and actions can be undertaken to control the system within the defined limits therefore our research will help the researchers to make decisions to control the operable parameters at wastewater treatment systems in advance by analyzing the variations in the influent characteristics hence the proposed lstm model can be an adequate interpolation tool for predicting the nutrient re of the a a o mbr system but proper calibration of measuring sensors is required to correct the measured data by eliminating drift

study the one year performance of an anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a a o mbr for removing nutrients such as nh4 n tn and tp at the okcheon sewage treatment plant republic of korea was monitored the sewage treatment plant consists of a primary sedimentation tank anaerobic anoxic and oxic membrane reactors and a clarifier as shown in the diagram presented in fig 1 the sedimentation tank collects the influent increases the hydrolysis and acidification of the particulate matter present in the wastewater and provides a constant flow to the anaerobic reactor mixers were used in the anaerobic and anoxic reactors to enhance the system efficiency and meet the throughput specifications of the microorganism by affecting the reaction kinetics the membrane bioreactor mbr was constructed from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and had a total membrane surface area of 64 000 m2 and a nominal pore size of 0 4 μm the mbr consists of several hollow fiber membrane modules placed in the oxic reactor with diffusers to maintain the do concentration which was measured by an online sensor in the mbr membrane filtration through a suction pump was conducted in continuous operation once the trans membrane pressure tmp exceeded 40 kpa the membrane module was removed from the reactor and cleaned with water and a 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution additionally the mlss concentration of the oxic mbr was measured to maintain a specific limit physio chemical and biological characteristics including total organic contents toc tn tp chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and suspended solids ss and operating parameters such as dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were monitored at wwtp the assessment of biodegradability at wwtp is of primary interest that directs to choose physiochemical or biological treatment processes a relationship between toc cod and ss can provide important information regarding oxidizable matter 40 nitrogen and phosphorous based nutrients are of great concern due to their dreadful effect on the environment 41 in addition controllable operating parameters such as do orp and mlss plays an important role in wastewater treatment therefore all these parameters were considered in this study to establish a relationship between them and the re of nutrients in the a a o mbr system 2 2 analytical methods the temperature ph do and orp were measured using online sensors and recorded for every hour of operation the toc and tn contents were also measured using an online analyzer shimaz toc l the tp cod nh4 n ss and mlss contents were measured following standard water and wastewater analysis methods 42 each parameter was monitored and recorded hourly measurements throughout the one year study 2 3 dataset and preprocessing the dataset was obtained from a sewage wastewater treatment plant at okcheon in the republic of korea for one year of plant operation wastewater characteristics are mainly divided into three classes such as physical chemical and biological although several parameters are monitored at wastewater treatment plants in this study influent characteristics including total organic contents toc tn tp chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and suspended solids ss and operating parameters such as the dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the influent wastewater quality indicators such as toc tn tp cod nh4 n and ss and operating parameters including do orp and mlss were considered as the input parameters while the re of nh4 n tn and tp were taken as the output parameters for the lstm model data analysis is an important step in machine learning and the development of artificial intelligence models therefore we first analyzed the operational and experimental datasets available for the training of the lstm model the preliminary data analysis aided the identification of trends patterns and anomalies of the dataset that is an important step in modeling it confirmed the wide range and non normal distribution of the dataset as shown in figs 2 and 3 input parameters ranges such as toc 0 06 101 72 tn 5 18 44 21 tp 0 63 6 05 cod 20 31 311 62 nh4 n 0 11 35 15 ss 0 83 161 25 do 0 02 6 30 orp 57 28 11 00 and mlss 2208 33 19976 00 output parameters were ranged as nh4 n 2 39 99 99 tn 15 98 93 86 tp 7 21 100 it is clear from trends of the input parameters that they have a wide range particularly the mlss content while the same scenario with output parameters along with a noisiness problem in the nh4 n data at the start that may be due to the measurement error moreover the lstm model is a recurrent neural network trained to resolve the gradient vanishing problem by using the backpropagation algorithm studies indicated that lstm models are sensitive to the randomization of the dataset particularly when non linear activation functions are used and the dataset should be normalized within the range of 0 1 therefore both the input and target datasets were normalized by systematic weight initialization to speed up the learning process resulting in faster convergence 37 39 the normalization of the dataset can address the issues of a wider range in input and output datasets the statistical analysis results of the influent characteristics of the wastewater and operating parameters are shown in table 1 several techniques can be applied to normalize a dataset including the min max technique and z score decimal scaling 43 44 in this study we used the most common min max normalization technique for data preprocessing within the range of 0 1 as described in eq 1 normalization changes the values in a dataset to a common scale without misrepresenting the differences in the ranges of the values as shown in table 2 the dataset can be easily normalized using the minmaxscaler preprocessing class from the scikit learn library in python programming 1 x x m i n a m a x a m i n a 2 4 long short term memory lstm network the long short term memory unit lstm network 45 is a descendant of the recurrent neural network rnn 46 it was proposed as a solution to the gradient explosion problem because of time intervals while back propagated error during the learning process on the rnn model network lstm networks predict an activity label at each time step there could be any number of previous time steps combined to predict an activity label the lstm model network is known to be an influential model in the past and shows learning capabilities from sequential data it can capture long term dependencies and efficiently learn from fluctuating length sequences fig 4 shows the lstm model unit the lstm unit has three gates these gates are responsible for controlling information flow the input gate is used to decide whether the input is significant enough to remember or not forget gate is used to decide when the lstm unit continue to memorize or forget the value the output gate is used to decide the output value from the lstm unit a standard lstm unit i consist a i as input of the unit and b i as the output of the unit b i t a n h a i the activation function is applied to a i the result was multiplied by b τ the inner activation b ω added for recurrent connection and results get scaled the factors b τ b φ b ω 0 1 are represented by white circles and controlled by input forget and output gates are represented by pink circles gating units add the previous layer activations and current layer activations the resulting value is squashed by sigmoid function and set to b τ b φ o r b ω 2 5 data preparation data preparation before feeding to a model is an important step in machine learning techniques input parameters including influent wastewater characteristics and operating parameters such as the toc tn tp cod nh4 n ss do orp and mlss were obtained as experimental data the removal of three important nutrients i e nh4 n tn and tp was investigated to evaluate the efficiency of the a a o mbr system at a full scale wastewater treatment plant the statistics of normalized input and output datasets are presented in table 2 output dataset plotted again by considering all three parameters including re of nh4 n tn and tp to show the trend after normalization as shown in fig 5 the output dataset of the first 1000 values are noisy particularly for nh4 n and this cannot be resolved by normalization such noisiness causes a decrease in the learning efficiency of lstm models therefore we removed the first 1000 values from the input and output datasets to enhance the training and prediction capability of the proposed model it was noticed that the re of nh4 n output dataset showed the best trend that can be easily learned by a model however even after dropping the noisy first 1000 data rows the tp exhibits more fluctuation than tn it is anticipated that the prediction of nh4 n can be more accurate because there is less deviation from a mean value in the dataset in the final stage of data preparation we determined the correlation between the input parameters using pearson s correlation coefficient which is the best method to measure the association between variables as it is based on the covariance method 47 a heatmap of pearson s correlation coefficient values is shown in fig 6 pearson s correlation coefficient values indicate that all parameters were positively correlated excluding do and orp which were negatively correlated with the other parameters but positively correlated with one other therefore all parameters were considered for lstm modeling in this study the final normalized input and output datasets containing 1000 7876 rows used for lstm modeling the experimental dataset was divided into two main parts the first was used for model training and the second was used for model testing as the dataset was large we used the first 6000 rows out of which actually 5000 data rows used for training the model after dropping the first 1000 values and remaining data were used for validation to avoid the overfitting problem after tuning the hyperparameters and achieving the best results we used the remaining 1876 data rows 6000 7876 in the dataset as unseen data to predict the re of nh4 n tn and tp in the a a o mbr system in the training phase supervised learning was conducted by providing targeted results and during the testing step the proposed model was used to predict the re of the targeted nutrients as learned in the training step the proposed lstm model was developed by python programming using the pandas library 2 6 proposed model after dataset pre processing it is fed to our proposed lstm network our proposed deep learning model has two stacked lstm layers l1 and l2 and one dense layer as shown in fig 7 the input of 9 parameters along with 10 previous time steps are provided to 198 lstm units with a batch size of 340 hence the input shape is 340 199 after l1 the output shape changed to none 1 198 because of 198 lstm units in l1 the output of l1 is provided to l2 with 99 lstm units the output shape after l2 is changed to none 99 the l2 regularization ridge regression technique is used as a kernel regularizer recurrent regularizer and bias regularizer in l2 in order to prevent overfitting and underfitting of the model the dropout rate of 0 2 is applied after l2 the output of the l2 is provided to a dense layer there are 3 neurons used in a dense layer along with linear activation function the neuron in the dense layer predicts the 3 outputs of re nh4 n tn and tp the time step 0 means only the current data is used as an input time step 10 means the previous 9 data values and the current data are used as an input 2 7 model performance evaluation model performance evaluation aims to confirm the accuracy of the proposed and check any errors to allow it to be applied with confidence 48 49 in this study the mean square error mse and root mse observations standard deviation ratio rsr performance were used to evaluate the results predicted by the proposed model eq s 8 and 9 were used as performance measuring criteria when evaluating the model and are described below 50 the mse and rsr values range from 0 to 1 and lower values indicate a good correlation between the experimental and model predicted results 8 m s e 1 n i 1 n y e x p i x p r e i 2 9 r s r r m

m e a n is the mean of the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 hyper parameters selection for proposed lstm model the proposed lstm network is implemented using keras library with tensorflow as a backend the sequential model in keras is used to implement stacked lstm layers some hyper parameters affect the performance of the model batch size epoch number number of layers number of units per layer and number of the previous time steps in sequence typically after probing over 300 networks using various combinations of hyper parameters an optimum model and its corresponding optimum hyper parameters can be found the optimum number of lstm units in the hidden layer was determined using different topologies by varying the number of lstm units from 2 300 each topology was tested using a loss function as the error function and repeated three times to confirm the results we did perform the number of experiments to select optimal hyper parameters for our proposed network the two layered stacked lstm network is selected after careful experiments the batch size 340 epoch size 1000 previous time step 10 gives us the best training and validation accuracy results for our proposed lstm model the followings are the minor hyper parameters of the selected configuration the dropout rate of 0 2 is selected only once after the second lstm layer adding more dropout layers disturbs accuracy and loss trends similarly increasing or decreasing the dropout rate also disturb accuracy and loss trends the model achieved the best results when selecting the rectified linear unit relu as the activation function with the adam optimization algorithm adam optimizer is used during training with a learning rate of 0 0001 the learning rate is a hyper parameter that controls the overriding of old data with newly acquired data and is important in weight modification based on the loss gradient the smaller value for the learning rate showed better results 3 2 training and validation results of lstm model fig 8 shows the training loss and validation loss curves for proposed two layered lstm with l1 198 and l2 99 having epoch size 2000 batch size 340 and previous time step 10 the x axis shows the number of epochs the y axis shows the training loss and validation loss the losses are calculated in terms of mean square error mse the red color trend shows the validation loss while the yellow color trend shows the training loss it is shown that training and validation losses are decreasing normally and curves are starting to saturate from the epoch 600 and quite stable till epoch 1000 hence the lstm network is trained well and there is no over fitting and under fitting till 1000 the losses of the proposed network reach the lower mean square error mse at epoch 1000 according to the training and validation loss learning was best at approximately 1000 epochs after 1000 epochs onward the model began memorizing and caused overfitting as the training loss was below the validation loss initially the model learning ability was poor however it improved as the number of epochs increased and overfitting may have also been avoided using the early stopping technique and can also be addressed by using a moderate batch size and changing the drop out parameter even at an increased number of epochs table 3 shows the training and validation losses of the lstm model at optimum hyper parameters 3 3 prediction results after the successful training and validation of the lstm model we fed the testing data into the model containing 1876 rows and tested the reliability of the model for the unseen dataset the prediction results of the proposed model were evaluated based on the mse and rsr values a good fit between the experimental and predicted results can be achieved if the value of the mse is zero which is improbable the average mse values were 0 0047 0 015 and 0 018 for nh4 n tn and tp for the unseen testing dataset respectively mse of testing dataset for each nutrient is presented in fig 9 it indicated that the best model learning was achieved for nh4 n due to the consistency in the trend of the dataset however for the other nutrients the variations in the dataset were larger resulted in less accuracy comparatively therefore the model learning performance for these nutrients was poor as indicated by the mse values of the prediction results testing dataset for the testing dataset the average rsr values were 0 0104 0 129 and 0 141 respectively the mse and rsr of the predictive model demonstrated how effectively the nutrient re of the a a o mbr system can be predicted using the proposed lstm network the re prediction of the nh4 n was comparatively better than that of the tn and tp re though the prediction results of the tn and tp were also acceptable on the basis of mse and rsr values precisely collected data without wide deviation can be traced more easily by the lstm neural network model than statistical techniques which cannot effectively utilize a non linear dataset this can aid in determining the concentrations of nutrients in the effluent that will be discharged after treatment to allow decision makers to change the controllable parameters and maintain the effluent standards therefore our proposed network is a competent prediction model for the nutrient re of an a a o mbr system that can assist wastewater treatment systems and contribute to the environment and economy of a country the mse results indicated that the minimum values were observed in the prediction of nh4 n re of the a a o mbr system in addition rsr values also supported these results and demonstrated that the model could predict the nh4 n re best while the prediction results for other nutrients including tn and tp were also acceptable due to the accurate measurement of parameters during analysis therefore the results demonstrated that the lstm model can predict the nutrient removal efficiencies of wastewater treatment plants if an accurately measured dataset is fed to the model the experimental and predicted results are compared in the following section 3 4 comparison of actual and model predicted results the actual results and those predicted by the lstm model are compared in fig 10 to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed lstm model the predicted results particularly the re of nh4 n almost match the actual results though there were a few variations caused by large deviations in the dataset moreover the plots for the re of tn and tp exhibited satisfactory results when the unseen dataset was used for prediction some of the peaks or differences shown in the plots could be due to outliers which caused large deviations in the consecutive results the prediction technique attempts to either exclude those points or plot them by examining whether such outliers were present in the training step the proposed lstm model successfully traced the non linear behavior of the a a o mbr system in wastewater treatment therefore the application of lstm based neural networks may aid in the automation and control of the removal of the targeted pollutants in wastewater treatment plants if instruments are calibrated timely to avoid drift phenomena of a sensor 4 conclusion in this study a deep learning approach was followed to predict the re of important nutrients such as nh4 n tn and tp by an a a o mbr system data analysis showed the trend of input output datasets and the association between variables was studied an lstm based recurrent neural network was constructed considering the nutrient re against various influent characteristics and operating parameters including toc tn tp cod nh4 n ss do orp and mlss the predictive capability of the proposed model was best after tuning the hyper parameters with average mse values of 0 0047 0 015 and 0 018 for nh4 n tn and tp in the unseen testing dataset respectively and average rsr values of 0 0104 0 129 and 0 141 respectively in future work the predicted nutrient re results can aid in improving the a a o mbr system to meet the effluent discharge standards which is a major concern in wastewater treatment systems moreover the anticipated concentration of nutrients in the effluent can be predicted using a real time dataset and actions can be undertaken to control the system within the defined limits therefore our research will help the researchers to make decisions to control the operable parameters at wastewater treatment systems in advance by analyzing the variations in the influent characteristics hence the proposed lstm model can be an adequate interpolation tool for predicting the nutrient re of the a a o mbr system but proper calibration of measuring sensors is required to correct the measured data by eliminating drift

13866,the purpose of this study was to use halophilic microorganisms and forward osmosis fo membrane to reduce volume and organic pollutants from synthetic saline produced water pw in an osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr the enriched bacterial community was initially cultivated in synthetic pw using a sequential batch bioreactor a suitable mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was prepared with organic loading rates of 0 16 1 2 kg cod m 3d 1 the mlss concentration increased to 1000 mg l 1 and a reduction in chemical oxygen demand cod greater than 90 was obtained after 65 days the ombr was then inoculated with the acclimated halophilic microorganisms for an influent of 1500 mg l 1 cod and 10 000 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds the results showed more than a 98 cod reduction in the permeated water to the draw solution resulting from a high rejection of the fo membrane the fo membrane reduced the pw volume by almost 30 and the operation of ombr decreased two thirds and 88 of the influent cod and oil and grease respectively due to the suitable biological degradation these findings demonstrate the potential use of ombr for pretreatment of pw keywords halophilic microorganism osmotic membrane bioreactor produced water forward osmosis 1 introduction produced water pw generates the most significant volume of waste streams in the oil and gas industries the presence of suspended particles dissolved sodium chloride and other inorganic salts dissolved hydrocarbons and oil droplets in pw harmfully impact the marine and natural environment 1 2 due to strict environmental regulations various treatment technologies such as physical chemical and biological processes are employed for pw treatment before discharge 3 4 on the other side pw is considered as a valuable water resource because it can be reused for various applications re injection irrigation and industrial water for this reason it has attracted much attention due to water scarcity 3 5 further in many physical and chemical processes membrane bioreactors mbrs have also been employed for the treatment of pw 6 7 using a conventional membrane process for separating oil droplets and other pollutants from the pw in mbrs increases energy consumption however ultrafiltration microfiltration uf mf membranes cannot be utilized as an effective barrier for the rejection of small and persistent organic contaminants 8 the osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr as an emerging process has been currently investigated for the treatment and reclamation of wastewaters and differs with mbr in the membrane process 9 11 in the ombr system the forward osmosis membrane is applied instead of the uf mf membrane in the membrane bioreactor process in the fo process the permeation of water molecules from saline and contaminated sources to the osmotic draw solution side naturally occurs across the membrane due to osmotic gradient 12 13 the performance of the fo membrane is similar to the reverse osmosis ro membrane and can therefore reject the small molecules and inorganic ions subsequently the diluted draw solution is sent to the recovery step to separate the permeated water for reuse while the draw solution returns to the membrane process the high rejection capacity of various pollutants and reversible fouling can be considered as two significant advantages of the fo membrane 14 15 the use of industrial reverse osmosis ro brine waste as a draw solution in the fo process leads to a considerable reduction of energy consumption in the ombr because no water recovery step is required to be applied to the diluted draw solution in fact the high salinity of the ro brine draw solution develops a steep osmotic water concentration gradient across the fo membrane leading to a suitable water permeation flux 16 17 the diluted draw solution by the permeated water through the membrane can be returned to the consumption cycle as the ro feed or discharged with less salinity to the environment few studies have been carried out for the biodegradation and separation of oil emulsified droplets using the forward osmosis process with the aim of reusing the permeate water 18 19 in most of the studies that used the fo process the short time low organic load and low salinity of pw were investigated also the application of a solely fo process has resulted in the accumulation of organic pollutants in the feed side causing severe membrane fouling 20 22 the ombr process demonstrates the interaction between two mechanisms physical osmotic membrane separation and biological degradation applying the fo membrane in the mbr would lead to a high rejection of pollutants high quality water production enhance the retention time for the removal of persistent organic contaminants by microorganisms and prevent irreversible membrane fouling 23 24 the main challenge associated with the application of the ombr in wastewater treatment is the salt accumulation in the bioreactor due to the concentration of feed solution and reverse salt diffusion from the draw solution to the feed side which reduces the function of the microorganisms 14 25 several researchers have investigated the effect of salinity build up in the ombr and concluded that this phenomenon is a crucial factor in the inhibition and toxicity of the biomass the microbial activity is related to the ability of the microorganism to adapt to the saline environment which makes them resistant against cell dehydration and plasmolysis 10 26 27 for this reason most ombr studies have focused on minimizing the reverse salt diffusion by selecting suitable draw solutions 28 investigating the impact of solid retention time srt variations 29 and using hybrid uf mf with the ombr 30 32 one of the approaches that deal with the effect of salt accumulation on the microbial activity is the utilization of halophilic microorganisms in the mbr 6 33 34 since these microorganisms can survive in an elevated salt environment they can be successfully used for the biological treatment of the pw in this study for the first time the performance of the osmotic membrane bioreactor has been evaluated using halophilic microorganisms the main objectives of this research were the reduction of the organic load in the saline synthetic pw by means of halophilic microorganisms along with successful water permeation via an fo membrane by using ro waste saline water as the draw solution this study focused on obtaining oil reduced pw for further processes safely discharging pw into the environment and production of water from pw 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials this study used a cellulose triacetate commercial fo membrane the water flux and rejection of the membrane against 1 m nacl draw solution were 9 l m 2 h 1 and 99 respectively all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and obtained from the sigma or merck companies the crude oil was obtained from the oil fields in ahwaz khuzestan province in the south of iran it will be named oil in the following sections 2 2 preparation of synthetic pw the composition of the prepared synthetic pw tds 15 000 mg l 1 consisted mg l 1 nacl 9 500 cacl2 2h2o 730 kcl 860 mgcl2 6h2o 3200 nahco3 340 and mgso4 7h2o 200 the pw obtained from several oil and gas wells in the south of iran had a tds of around 15 000 mg l 1 therefore the synthetic pw was prepared according to this tds and nh4cl and kh2po4 were added to the pw to adjust the c n p ratio as 100 10 1 the ph of the feed was also adjusted to 7 by the naoh solution to attain stable droplets of oil in the synthetic pw tween 80 was added at a ratio of 1 7 v v to the crude oil then it was diluted with the mixed salt solution finally the synthetic pw was prepared by blending the constituents in a homogenizer 2000 min 1 for two hours 6 33 2 3 preparation of a halophilic bacterial community the halophilic bacterial community was initially enriched from the saline sediment sample collected from the coast of the caspian sea based on a previously published method 34 the identified bacterial species in this consortium include pseudomonas pseudomallei clostridium sp micrococcus roseus proteus vulgaris and staphylococcus aureus then the microbial community was cultivated in the synthetic pw in a sequential batch bioreactor for about 65 days to obtain the mlss with a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 prior to adding it to the ombr in this regard 50 ml of the bacterial suspension was first added to one liter of the synthetic pw under aeration and mixing the four different organic loading rates olrs of 16 0 35 0 7 and 1 2 kg cod m 3d 1 were sequentially used to enhance the population of the microorganisms while adapting them with the synthetic pw the tds of the mixed liquor was kept at 15 000 mg l 1 in all of the olrs table 1 shows the conditions of the mixed liquor at the different olrs at each stage olr a defined quantity of oil was added to the mixed liquor and the initial cod and oil and gas content o g were measured the operation cycle for each olr was 24 h which was divided into feeding 30 min aeration 21 h sludge settling and liquid withdraw 2 h at the end of the cycle the biomass settled and the supernatant was withdrawn using a peristaltic pump watson 101u r marlow uk to obtain a volume exchange ratio ver of 0 75 2 4 experimental ombr set up fig 1 demonstrates a schematic diagram of the bench scale aerobic ombr which consisted of a stirred bioreactor attached to a u typed draw solution container through an fo membrane the active membrane area of 12 56 cm2 was used under the fo mode i e active layer facing the bioreactor and support layer facing the draw solution the volumes of the bioreactor and draw solution tank were 2 and 3 l respectively during the experiments the mixed liquor synthetic pw microbial inoculant was magnetically stirred in the feed tank and the feed solution with an olr of 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 and a tds of 10 000 mgl 1 consisted mg l 1 nacl 6300 cacl2 2h2o 500 kcl 570 mgcl2 6h2o 2100 nahco3 230 and mgso4 7h2o 143 was continuously added to the bioreactor via the ﬂoat valve to maintain a constant level the food to microorganism f m ratio was in the range of 0 37 0 04 kg cod kgmlss 1d 1 the accumulation of salt in the bioreactor was monitored by measuring the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor using a conductivity meter hq14d hach germany at the end of each four day interval cycle the mixed liquor 1 5 l was allowed to settle and the supernatant 1 l was collected and replaced by fresh feed the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor at each cycle increased from 15 to about 30 ms cm 1 corresponds to approximate salinity changes of 10 20 g l 1 in the bioreactor therefore the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh feed after each cycle to mitigate salt accumulation in the bioreactor and reduction of water flux the temperature of the bioreactor was kept at 24 c by a heater 50 w for measuring the permeate water flux the draw solution tank was located on a digital balance entris4202 1s sartorius germany interfaced to a computer and weight changes were recorded since sodium chloride is dominant in industrial ro brine a 1 5 m nacl solution synthetic brine was used as the draw solution a gear pump wp 1020h china was used to recirculate the draw solution with the ﬂow rate of 2 l min 1 to reduce the influence of external concentration polarization to maintain the concentration of the draw solution a relatively large volume 3 l tank was used and all the draw solution was refreshed after 24 h the ombr was intermittently aerated via a peristaltic air pump and tubular nozzles the aeration intervals 2 min aeration followed by 5 min rest were controlled by a timer the three way nozzle was located near the membrane surface to reduce external concentration polarization and avoid the accumulation of foulant onto the membrane surface by inserting hydrodynamic shear force the dissolved oxygen was measured as 6 mg l 1 2 5 membrane cleaning two cleaning methods osmotic backwash and chemical cleaning were applied consecutively to remove the fouling component from the membrane surface the membrane water flux was measured after each cleaning method to show their effectiveness for water flux recovery in the osmotic backwash method the feed and draw solutions were replaced by nacl 2 m and deionized di water respectively after two hours the system was washed with di water for 15 min then the chemical cleaning was done by replacing the feed solution with 15 mm of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution at a ph of 7 for 30 min in the end di water was circulated again for 15 min to eliminate the residual sds solution since the membrane was not changed for all the ombr experiments the sem images and contact angle measurement were performed on the fo membrane after 5000 min of exposure to the 1000 mg l 1 oil water solution to characterize the membrane fouling and effectiveness of the cleaning procedure 2 6 analytical methods due to the high concentration of chloride ions the freire and sant anna method 35 for saline waters was used for measuring the cod of the samples using a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach germany this method allows the determination of cod in waters with high chloride concentration and avoids overestimation of cod levels the bioreactor supernatant samples were centrifuged at 6000 min 1 for 15 min and then was applied for cod measurement the mlss of the mixed liquor was analyzed according to the washed mlss method 33 in this method the biomass samples were washed with methylene chloride solvent to eliminate the trapped oil between the cells the washed biomass samples were then analyzed according to the standard test method 36 the available hydrocarbons in the feed and efﬂuent streams were defined as oil and grease content o g and were measured according to the standard test method 36 for this procedure 1 l of the sample was shaken vigorously three times with 30 ml of n hexane at a ph 2 the extracted phase was ﬁltered through anhydrous sodium sulfate to eliminate water after the evaporation of the solvent the sample was dried and weighed by an analytical balance scanning electron microscopy zeiss sigma vp sem germany was used to evaluate the fouling of the membrane surface the effectiveness of the cleaning methods in removing the foulant was investigated by membrane hydrophobicity determined by measuring the contact angle ca a droplet of water was placed on the membrane surface using a micro syringe then the image of the droplet on the membrane was captured by a high speed camera zeiss germany finally the ca was measured according to the difference between the baseline and the tangent line of the droplet on the membrane surface the analysis of all the data was repeated three times 2 7 water flux determination in ombr the experimental water flux was determined by measuring the weight difference of the draw solution at regular time intervals the data logging software labview is as follows 1 j w δ w ρ t a where δw ρ t and a are the weight increase of the draw solution g density of water g l 1 time interval h and membrane active area m² respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 adaptation of microorganisms to oil in different olrs the halophilic bacterial community was cultivated in the synthetic pw at four different olrs 0 16 0 35 0 70 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 using a sequencing batch reactor for about 65 days to adapt the cells to the oil and increase the microbial population the biological activity of the microorganisms was tested by cod mlss and o g measurements the influent cod concentration changed from 200 to 1500 mg l 1 and the variations in mlss and cod removal at olr1 to olr4 were measured fig 2 at the beginning of the olr1 operation cycle the cod removal efficiency was less than 50 due to the low microbial population i e mlss of around 200 mg l 1 and while in the adaptation phase the biodegradation rate of the organic compounds was relatively low nevertheless after the adaptation of the microorganisms to the environmental conditions and the completion of the metabolic process with organic carbon the mlss concentration gradually increased and 90 cod removal efficiency was achieved in the olr2 cycle the cod removal efficiency was reduced to about 70 due to the increase in the influent organic loading rate to 0 35 kg cod m 3d 1 equivalent to cod 440 mg l 1 alongside the enhancement of the mlss concentration to 520 mg l 1 the cod removal reached 92 at the end of the cycle the removal efficiency of the organic compounds in both the olr3 0 7 kgcod m 3d 1 and olr4 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 cycles reached to more than 90 with a gradual increase of the mlss concentration from 200 up to 1000 mg l 1 a high cod removal efficiency was attained over time from the olr1 to olr4 cycles the adapted halophilic bacterial culture at an mlss concentration of about 1000 g l 1 was used for the ombr studies the results showed the ability of the microorganisms to adapt to the media salinity of 15 g l 1 the mlss gradually increased in each constant olr which is reported by other researchers 6 34 the findings of this study are consistent with other studies where the capability of halophilic bacteria in growing and degrading organic pollutants has been shown under hypersaline conditions 33 37 also a stable condition was obtained after almost 12 days of operation in each olr cycle concerning the biodegradation of the organic load fig 2 fig 3 shows the average values of cod and o g in the effluent and their respective standard deviations at each stable condition with increasing the organic loading rate from 0 16 kgcod m 3d 1 in olr1 to 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 in olr4 the cod and o g in the bioreactor effluent increased the enhancement of residual organic carbon could be attributed to an increase of persistent and non biodegradable compounds of crude oil in the bioreactor 6 34 it is also significant to note that biopolymers and other soluble metabolites produced by the microorganisms may contribute to cod in the effluent 6 3 2 biological performance of ombr the microorganisms that were acclimated to the synthetic pw were used for the operation of an ombr for 36 days where the inﬂuent cod was adjusted to around 1500 mg l 1 1400 1550 mg l 1 the biological performance of the ombr system was investigated by evaluating the cod values in the feed solution bioreactor and draw solution the results are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 where each vertical line represents a new cycle with the feed solution replacement in the ombr the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor at each cycle increased from 15 to about 30 ms cm 1 corresponds to approximate salinity of 10 20 g l 1 in the bioreactor however the cod levels remained in the range of 393 613 mg l 1 in the bioreactor fig 5 the reduction of the cod and o g from 1500 mgl 1 and 215 mgl 1 in the feed solution to the range of 393 613 mg l 1 and 22 5 55 3 mg l 1 in the bioreactor respectively indicated that the buildup of salinity from 10 20 g l 1 did not have a significant impact on the biological process due to the use of halophilic microorganisms also it was evident that the difference between the cod in the feed solution and bioreactor was the outcome of the combination of adsorption and biological degradation by the microorganisms flocs 34 the cod values in the draw solution were less than 20 mg l 1 which showed a 98 cod removal due to the high rejection characteristics of the fo membrane in the mbr studies a cod reduction of 83 was reported with the use of halophilic microorganisms due to the lower rejection of the ultrafiltration membrane 6 as shown in fig 5 the cod of the bioreactor at the end of each cycle in the a series experiments 5 periods 20 days gradually increased to 480 511 567 613 and 581 mg l also the o g concentration in the ombr raised during four cycles to 45 6 49 5 50 2 52 9 as stated before the residual cod and o g in the bioreactor was probably related to the accumulation of non hard biodegradation components of the crude oil as well as the production of soluble microbial products smp as a result of microbial growth 6 34 nevertheless after 20 days of the ombr operation series b experiments the final cod in the bioreactor in each cycle became smaller equivalent to 492 472 446 and 437 mg l 1 and o g concentration declined to 41 5 36 8 32 6 26 mg l according to the structure of the fo membrane the amount of o g in the draw solution was negligible in addition it decreased from and 215 mg l 1 bioreactor influent to less than 25 mg l 1 in bioreactor effluent by the activity of microorganisms most of the environmental regulations propose a daily or monthly maximum limit for o g discharge into the aquatic environment but none for cod for instance based on the us environmental protection agency usepa regulations the maximum daily limit for o g and its monthly average is set as 42 and 29 mg l 1 respectively 6 this phenomenon clearly showed the development of the halophilic microorganisms resistance against the increase in salinity and reached a steady condition it is also interesting to note that the interplay between the biodegradation and physical separation by the fo membrane played an essential role in cod removal in the ombr in fact the rejection of the organic compounds by the forward osmosis membrane would prolong their retention time in the bioreactor and facilitate higher biodegradation 23 high oil rejection was seen in the ombr system governed by the non porous structure of the fo membrane the cod levels in the draw solution fell in the range of 15 21 5 mg l 1 and more than 98 of cod removal was achieved when compared with the inﬂuent cod 1500 mg l 1 of the ombr system the high rejection of organic components in the present study was consistent with earlier reports for the treatment of wastewater with an ombr system 23 30 31 it is worth noting that the amount of salinity in those studies was meager and the salt accumulation in the bioreactor that was due to the reverse salt flux from the draw solution affected the microbial activity over time 26 29 another research which employed a membrane bioreactor mbr for treatment of pw reported that the cod removal efficiency was approximately 87 for olr 1 2 kg cod m 3d 1 tds 64 4 g l 1 this difference might be due to the use of an fo membrane with an ro membrane like structure instead of the microﬁltration membrane 6 the cod values in the feed solution remained within the range of 400 500 mg l 1during the operation time therefore two thirds fraction of the influent cod was reduced in the ombr operation this result indicates that ombr might be used as a pretreatment of produced water the pw effluent of ombr could be further treated to remove the remaining oil grease content and then could be desalinated by a suitable method the clean salty pw might also be discharged to the ocean re inject to the oil well or discharge to the evaporation pond 3 3 water flux performance of ombr the variation of water flux during the operation time in the ombr system is illustrated in fig 6 as mentioned in the previous section the ombr operation was carried out for 36 days and each vertical line in fig 6 represents a new cycle the initial cod and tds of the feed solution synthetic pw were 1500 and 10 000 mg l 1 respectively a 1 5 m nacl solution with an osmotic pressure of 72 6 bar was used as the draw solution the water flux through the fo membrane showed a decreasing trend at each cycle the decline in the water flux in the ombr could be attributed to salt accumulation in the feed side as well as membrane fouling attachment of oil drops biofilm and biological products to the membrane surface feed salinity led to a decrease in water flux due to the counteracted part of the draw solution osmotic pressure thus resulting in a lower effective osmotic pressure and driving force 38 moreover as reported by others solutions with high ionic strength might de swell the cta membrane through charge neutralization within the polymer matrix leading to low water permeation 39 40 due to the high fo membrane capability for the rejection of solute in the bioreactor along with water permeation the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor increased 15 30 ms cm 1 within four days and the water flux gradually decreased the conductivity in the ombr has an opposite trend of water flux fig 7 the conductivity raised from 15 30 ms cm 1 for the first three cycles of a series a i a ii and a iii however in the next periods a iv a v the water flux reduced due to membrane fouling led to decreasing the electrical conductivity in the ombr tank and it reached 28 ms cm 1 at the end of the a v cycle the same trend was repeated for cycles of b series after membrane cleaning membrane fouling is another reason that might result in the decline of membrane flux through the formation of hydraulic resistance in addition to the attachment of the biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps on the membrane surface fouling in the ombr might occur with the deposition of oil droplets on the membrane surface the water contact angle of the cta membrane increased from 49 5 for a new membrane to 70 after exposure to the pw containing cod 1000 mg l 1 the attachment of foulants onto the membrane surface enhanced the hydrophobic characteristics of the membrane and prevented water permeation across the membrane in addition the fouling layer hindered the salt transfer from the draw solution to the feed side therefore the salt concentration at the interface between the fouling layer and the membrane may increase and the net osmotic pressure decrease 41 according to fig 6 the membrane ﬂux decreased from the initial 5 83 to 4 63 lmh during the first cycle the drop in the flux was 0 4 lmh per day for the a i cycle and reached 0 36 and 0 34 lmh per day for the a ii and a iii cycles respectively the water flux generally declined in the initial cycles due to salt accumulation and the fouling of the fresh membrane after three cycles the drop in the water flux decreased to 0 27 lmh per day for the a iv cycle this trend showed that the fouling stabilized and the salt accumulation led to the decline in the water flux however for the v a cycle the water flux rate increased again to 0 35 lmh per day which could be attributed to accelerated cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop in this phenomenon the fouling layer might capture the draw solutes due to the reverse salt flux and resulted in a greater loss of the fo driving force 42 after membrane cleaning and removing the foulants on the membrane surface the water flux declined at a fast pace and reached 0 38 0 31 and 0 29 lmh per day for the b i b ii and b iii cycles respectively moreover it should be pointed out that the osmotic pressure created by fouling on the membrane surface could also affect the decline of the flux since this microbial fouling layer is negatively charged 41 and generally carries functional groups containing carboxyl amine phosphoric and hydroxyl groups a large number of counter ions exist within the membrane fouling for reaching electro neutrality therefore the formation of the fouling resulted in enhancing the osmotic pressure in the feed side and reducing the water flux it is also apparent in fig 6 that when the feed solution was refreshed after each cycle there was an increase in the water flux due to the reclamation of osmotic pressure nevertheless fouling gradually expanded during the ombr experiments which resulted in a decrease in the water flux after each refreshment the dashed line in fig 6 displays this phenomenon the slope of the dashed line at the a series 0 15 lmh per day and b series 0 18 lmh per day cycles could be attributed to the increasing membrane fouling in a biological environment therefore membrane cleaning should be periodically considered to maintain system operations by considering the average flux 4 lmh through the fo membrane nearly 0 48 l out of the 1 5 l feed solution transferred to the draw solution this indicated that 32 of the produced water volume was reduced in each cycle 3 4 membrane fouling the ombr system was intermittently aerated in an on off cycle 2 5 min to provide oxygen for the microorganisms and mitigate the fouling aeration assists in preventing the accumulation of foulant on the membrane surface by creating hydraulic disturbance near the membrane in addition it elevates local mixing reduces external concentration polarization and enhances the water flux 43 44 however the presence of oil drops in synthetic pw as well as eps deposited on the membrane surface could not easily be detached by air bubbling the ombr was operated for 20 days in five cycles without any membrane cleaning the membrane fouling and cake layer formation after four cycles caused a reduction of the water flux from 5 8 to 3 7 lmin 1 h 1 therefore osmotic backward washing and chemical cleaning were carried out to remove the foulants on the membrane surface the performance of the fo membrane was tested using di water as the feed solution in order to better understand the effect of each cleaning method for membrane foulant removal the resulting water fluxes are shown by the red triangle symbols in fig 6 which can be compared to the initial membrane flux the osmotic backwashing method could only recover 73 of the initial water flux fig 6 due to the secure attachment of oil droplets microbial derived organic matters onto the membrane surface fig 8 shows the sem images of the fouled membrane by the oil droplets exposure to the pw containing cod 1000 mg l 1 and without the presence of microorganisms the images indicate that most of the foulants were removed from the membrane surface by the backwashing method and the contact angle decreased from 75 to 67 however foulants on the surface can be seen therefore the backwashing was followed by a chemical cleaning method and the water flux could be recovered to 86 of the initial flux the chemical treatment was successful in removing most of the foulants attached to the membrane surface so that the sem image obtained for the membrane surface after the chemical treatment is similar to the fresh membrane and the membrane contact angle was reduced to 55 the presence of sds with a hydrophobic tail in the cleaning solution facilitates the removal of the oil droplets from the membrane surface and leads to an increase in water flux recovery sds may solubilize macromolecules in water by forming micelles around them or absorb the organics by the hydrophobic tails thereby facilitates the removal of foulants from the membrane surface it is worth mentioning ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta and naoh solution are also effective cleaning agents at high ph for eliminating foulant from the fo membrane surface 22 since the cta membrane used in this study has a limited tolerant ph range of 3 8 the sds solution was more suitable for this purpose 4 conclusions the combination of biological treatment and the high rejection of the fo membrane in the ombr indicated a 98 cod removal from saline pw besides the cod and o g values of pw decreased from 1500 mg l 1 and 215 mg l 1 bioreactor influent to less than 450 mg l 1 and 25 mg l 1 in bioreactor effluent respectively in addition approximately 30 of the influent volume of pw was reduced during the operation time of the ombr these achievements showed that the ombr using halophilic microorganisms and draw solution of the ro brine could be used as a pretreatment for the reduction of organic loading and volume of pw in the other hand permeated water reduces the salinity of ro brine to deal with the environmental effects of its disposal

13866,the purpose of this study was to use halophilic microorganisms and forward osmosis fo membrane to reduce volume and organic pollutants from synthetic saline produced water pw in an osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr the enriched bacterial community was initially cultivated in synthetic pw using a sequential batch bioreactor a suitable mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was prepared with organic loading rates of 0 16 1 2 kg cod m 3d 1 the mlss concentration increased to 1000 mg l 1 and a reduction in chemical oxygen demand cod greater than 90 was obtained after 65 days the ombr was then inoculated with the acclimated halophilic microorganisms for an influent of 1500 mg l 1 cod and 10 000 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds the results showed more than a 98 cod reduction in the permeated water to the draw solution resulting from a high rejection of the fo membrane the fo membrane reduced the pw volume by almost 30 and the operation of ombr decreased two thirds and 88 of the influent cod and oil and grease respectively due to the suitable biological degradation these findings demonstrate the potential use of ombr for pretreatment of pw keywords halophilic microorganism osmotic membrane bioreactor produced water forward osmosis 1 introduction produced water pw generates the most significant volume of waste streams in the oil and gas industries the presence of suspended particles dissolved sodium chloride and other inorganic salts dissolved hydrocarbons and oil droplets in pw harmfully impact the marine and natural environment 1 2 due to strict environmental regulations various treatment technologies such as physical chemical and biological processes are employed for pw treatment before discharge 3 4 on the other side pw is considered as a valuable water resource because it can be reused for various applications re injection irrigation and industrial water for this reason it has attracted much attention due to water scarcity 3 5 further in many physical and chemical processes membrane bioreactors mbrs have also been employed for the treatment of pw 6 7 using a conventional membrane process for separating oil droplets and other pollutants from the pw in mbrs increases energy consumption however ultrafiltration microfiltration uf mf membranes cannot be utilized as an effective barrier for the rejection of small and persistent organic contaminants 8 the osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr as an emerging process has been currently investigated for the treatment and reclamation of wastewaters and differs with mbr in the membrane process 9 11 in the ombr system the forward osmosis membrane is applied instead of the uf mf membrane in the membrane bioreactor process in the fo process the permeation of water molecules from saline and contaminated sources to the osmotic draw solution side naturally occurs across the membrane due to osmotic gradient 12 13 the performance of the fo membrane is similar to the reverse osmosis ro membrane and can therefore reject the small molecules and inorganic ions subsequently the diluted draw solution is sent to the recovery step to separate the permeated water for reuse while the draw solution returns to the membrane process the high rejection capacity of various pollutants and reversible fouling can be considered as two significant advantages of the fo membrane 14 15 the use of industrial reverse osmosis ro brine waste as a draw solution in the fo process leads to a considerable reduction of energy consumption in the ombr because no water recovery step is required to be applied to the diluted draw solution in fact the high salinity of the ro brine draw solution develops a steep osmotic water concentration gradient across the fo membrane leading to a suitable water permeation flux 16 17 the diluted draw solution by the permeated water through the membrane can be returned to the consumption cycle as the ro feed or discharged with less salinity to the environment few studies have been carried out for the biodegradation and separation of oil emulsified droplets using the forward osmosis process with the aim of reusing the permeate water 18 19 in most of the studies that used the fo process the short time low organic load and low salinity of pw were investigated also the application of a solely fo process has resulted in the accumulation of organic pollutants in the feed side causing severe membrane fouling 20 22 the ombr process demonstrates the interaction between two mechanisms physical osmotic membrane separation and biological degradation applying the fo membrane in the mbr would lead to a high rejection of pollutants high quality water production enhance the retention time for the removal of persistent organic contaminants by microorganisms and prevent irreversible membrane fouling 23 24 the main challenge associated with the application of the ombr in wastewater treatment is the salt accumulation in the bioreactor due to the concentration of feed solution and reverse salt diffusion from the draw solution to the feed side which reduces the function of the microorganisms 14 25 several researchers have investigated the effect of salinity build up in the ombr and concluded that this phenomenon is a crucial factor in the inhibition and toxicity of the biomass the microbial activity is related to the ability of the microorganism to adapt to the saline environment which makes them resistant against cell dehydration and plasmolysis 10 26 27 for this reason most ombr studies have focused on minimizing the reverse salt diffusion by selecting suitable draw solutions 28 investigating the impact of solid retention time srt variations 29 and using hybrid uf mf with the ombr 30 32 one of the approaches that deal with the effect of salt accumulation on the microbial activity is the utilization of halophilic microorganisms in the mbr 6 33 34 since these microorganisms can survive in an elevated salt environment they can be successfully used for the biological treatment of the pw in this study for the first time the performance of the osmotic membrane bioreactor has been evaluated using halophilic microorganisms the main objectives of this research were the reduction of the organic load in the saline synthetic pw by means of halophilic microorganisms along with successful water permeation via an fo membrane by using ro waste saline water as the draw solution this study focused on obtaining oil reduced pw for further processes safely discharging pw into the environment and production of water from pw 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials this study used a cellulose triacetate commercial fo membrane the water flux and rejection of the membrane against 1 m nacl draw solution were 9 l m 2 h 1 and 99 respectively all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and obtained from the sigma or merck companies the crude oil was obtained from the oil fields in ahwaz khuzestan province in the south of iran it will be named oil in the following sections 2 2 preparation of synthetic pw the composition of the prepared synthetic pw tds 15 000 mg l 1 consisted mg l 1 nacl 9 500 cacl2 2h2o 730 kcl 860 mgcl2 6h2o 3200 nahco3 340 and mgso4 7h2o 200 the pw obtained from several oil and gas wells in the south of iran had a tds of around 15 000 mg l 1 therefore the synthetic pw was prepared according to this tds and nh4cl and kh2po4 were added to the pw to adjust the c n p ratio as 100 10 1 the ph of the feed was also adjusted to 7 by the naoh solution to attain stable droplets of oil in the synthetic pw tween 80 was added at a ratio of 1 7 v v to the crude oil then it was diluted with the mixed salt solution finally the synthetic pw was prepared by blending the constituents in a homogenizer 2000 min 1 for two hours 6 33 2 3 preparation of a halophilic bacterial community the halophilic bacterial community was initially enriched from the saline sediment sample collected from the coast of the caspian sea based on a previously published method 34 the identified bacterial species in this consortium include pseudomonas pseudomallei clostridium sp micrococcus roseus proteus vulgaris and staphylococcus aureus then the microbial community was cultivated in the synthetic pw in a sequential batch bioreactor for about 65 days to obtain the mlss with a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 prior to adding it to the ombr in this regard 50 ml of the bacterial suspension was first added to one liter of the synthetic pw under aeration and mixing the four different organic loading rates olrs of 16 0 35 0 7 and 1 2 kg cod m 3d 1 were sequentially used to enhance the population of the microorganisms while adapting them with the synthetic pw the tds of the mixed liquor was kept at 15 000 mg l 1 in all of the olrs table 1 shows the conditions of the mixed liquor at the different olrs at each stage olr a defined quantity of oil was added to the mixed liquor and the initial cod and oil and gas content o g were measured the operation cycle for each olr was 24 h which was divided into feeding 30 min aeration 21 h sludge settling and liquid withdraw 2 h at the end of the cycle the biomass settled and the supernatant was withdrawn using a peristaltic pump watson 101u r marlow uk to obtain a volume exchange ratio ver of 0 75 2 4 experimental ombr set up fig 1 demonstrates a schematic diagram of the bench scale aerobic ombr which consisted of a stirred bioreactor attached to a u typed draw solution container through an fo membrane the active membrane area of 12 56 cm2 was used under the fo mode i e active layer facing the bioreactor and support layer facing the draw solution the volumes of the bioreactor and draw solution tank were 2 and 3 l respectively during the experiments the mixed liquor synthetic pw microbial inoculant was magnetically stirred in the feed tank and the feed solution with an olr of 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 and a tds of 10 000 mgl 1 consisted mg l 1 nacl 6300 cacl2 2h2o 500 kcl 570 mgcl2 6h2o 2100 nahco3 230 and mgso4 7h2o 143 was continuously added to the bioreactor via the ﬂoat valve to maintain a constant level the food to microorganism f m ratio was in the range of 0 37 0 04 kg cod kgmlss 1d 1 the accumulation of salt in the bioreactor was monitored by measuring the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor using a conductivity meter hq14d hach germany at the end of each four day interval cycle the mixed liquor 1 5 l was allowed to settle and the supernatant 1 l was collected and replaced by fresh feed the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor at each cycle increased from 15 to about 30 ms cm 1 corresponds to approximate salinity changes of 10 20 g l 1 in the bioreactor therefore the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh feed after each cycle to mitigate salt accumulation in the bioreactor and reduction of water flux the temperature of the bioreactor was kept at 24 c by a heater 50 w for measuring the permeate water flux the draw solution tank was located on a digital balance entris4202 1s sartorius germany interfaced to a computer and weight changes were recorded since sodium chloride is dominant in industrial ro brine a 1 5 m nacl solution synthetic brine was used as the draw solution a gear pump wp 1020h china was used to recirculate the draw solution with the ﬂow rate of 2 l min 1 to reduce the influence of external concentration polarization to maintain the concentration of the draw solution a relatively large volume 3 l tank was used and all the draw solution was refreshed after 24 h the ombr was intermittently aerated via a peristaltic air pump and tubular nozzles the aeration intervals 2 min aeration followed by 5 min rest were controlled by a timer the three way nozzle was located near the membrane surface to reduce external concentration polarization and avoid the accumulation of foulant onto the membrane surface by inserting hydrodynamic shear force the dissolved oxygen was measured as 6 mg l 1 2 5 membrane cleaning two cleaning methods osmotic backwash and chemical cleaning were applied consecutively to remove the fouling component from the membrane surface the membrane water flux was measured after each cleaning method to show their effectiveness for water flux recovery in the osmotic backwash method the feed and draw solutions were replaced by nacl 2 m and deionized di water respectively after two hours the system was washed with di water for 15 min then the chemical cleaning was done by replacing the feed solution with 15 mm of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution at a ph of 7 for 30 min in the end di water was circulated again for 15 min to eliminate the residual sds solution since the membrane was not changed for all the ombr experiments the sem images and contact angle measurement were performed on the fo membrane after 5000 min of exposure to the 1000 mg l 1 oil water solution to characterize the membrane fouling and effectiveness of the cleaning procedure 2 6 analytical methods due to the high concentration of chloride ions the freire and sant anna method 35 for saline waters was used for measuring the cod of the samples using a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach germany this method allows the determination of cod in waters with high chloride concentration and avoids overestimation of cod levels the bioreactor supernatant samples were centrifuged at 6000 min 1 for 15 min and then was applied for cod measurement the mlss of the mixed liquor was analyzed according to the washed mlss method 33 in this method the biomass samples were washed with methylene chloride solvent to eliminate the trapped oil between the cells the washed biomass samples were then analyzed according to the standard test method 36 the available hydrocarbons in the feed and efﬂuent streams were defined as oil and grease content o g and were measured according to the standard test method 36 for this procedure 1 l of the sample was shaken vigorously three times with 30 ml of n hexane at a ph 2 the extracted phase was ﬁltered through anhydrous sodium sulfate to eliminate water after the evaporation of the solvent the sample was dried and weighed by an analytical balance scanning electron microscopy zeiss sigma vp sem germany was used to evaluate the fouling of the membrane surface the effectiveness of the cleaning methods in removing the foulant was investigated by membrane hydrophobicity determined by measuring the contact angle ca a droplet of water was placed on the membrane surface using a micro syringe then the image of the droplet on the membrane was captured by a high speed camera zeiss germany finally the ca was measured according to the difference between the baseline and the tangent line of the droplet on the membrane surface the analysis of all the data was repeated three times 2 7 water flux determination in ombr the experimental water flux was determined by measuring the weight difference of the draw solution at regular time intervals the data logging software labview is as follows 1 j w δ w ρ t a where δw ρ t and a are the weight increase of the draw solution g density of water g l 1 time interval h and membrane active area m² respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 adaptation of microorganisms to oil in different olrs the halophilic bacterial community was cultivated in the synthetic pw at four different olrs 0 16 0 35 0 70 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 using a sequencing batch reactor for about 65 days to adapt the cells to the oil and increase the microbial population the biological activity of the microorganisms was tested by cod mlss and o g measurements the influent cod concentration changed from 200 to 1500 mg l 1 and the variations in mlss and cod removal at olr1 to olr4 were measured fig 2 at the beginning of the olr1 operation cycle the cod removal efficiency was less than 50 due to the low microbial population i e mlss of around 200 mg l 1 and while in the adaptation phase the biodegradation rate of the organic compounds was relatively low nevertheless after the adaptation of the microorganisms to the environmental conditions and the completion of the metabolic process with organic carbon the mlss concentration gradually increased and 90 cod removal efficiency was achieved in the olr2 cycle the cod removal efficiency was reduced to about 70 due to the increase in the influent organic loading rate to 0 35 kg cod m 3d 1 equivalent to cod 440 mg l 1 alongside the enhancement of the mlss concentration to 520 mg l 1 the cod removal reached 92 at the end of the cycle the removal efficiency of the organic compounds in both the olr3 0 7 kgcod m 3d 1 and olr4 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 cycles reached to more than 90 with a gradual increase of the mlss concentration from 200 up to 1000 mg l 1 a high cod removal efficiency was attained over time from the olr1 to olr4 cycles the adapted halophilic bacterial culture at an mlss concentration of about 1000 g l 1 was used for the ombr studies the results showed the ability of the microorganisms to adapt to the media salinity of 15 g l 1 the mlss gradually increased in each constant olr which is reported by other researchers 6 34 the findings of this study are consistent with other studies where the capability of halophilic bacteria in growing and degrading organic pollutants has been shown under hypersaline conditions 33 37 also a stable condition was obtained after almost 12 days of operation in each olr cycle concerning the biodegradation of the organic load fig 2 fig 3 shows the average values of cod and o g in the effluent and their respective standard deviations at each stable condition with increasing the organic loading rate from 0 16 kgcod m 3d 1 in olr1 to 1 2 kgcod m 3d 1 in olr4 the cod and o g in the bioreactor effluent increased the enhancement of residual organic carbon could be attributed to an increase of persistent and non biodegradable compounds of crude oil in the bioreactor 6 34 it is also significant to note that biopolymers and other soluble metabolites produced by the microorganisms may contribute to cod in the effluent 6 3 2 biological performance of ombr the microorganisms that were acclimated to the synthetic pw were used for the operation of an ombr for 36 days where the inﬂuent cod was adjusted to around 1500 mg l 1 1400 1550 mg l 1 the biological performance of the ombr system was investigated by evaluating the cod values in the feed solution bioreactor and draw solution the results are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 where each vertical line represents a new cycle with the feed solution replacement in the ombr the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor at each cycle increased from 15 to about 30 ms cm 1 corresponds to approximate salinity of 10 20 g l 1 in the bioreactor however the cod levels remained in the range of 393 613 mg l 1 in the bioreactor fig 5 the reduction of the cod and o g from 1500 mgl 1 and 215 mgl 1 in the feed solution to the range of 393 613 mg l 1 and 22 5 55 3 mg l 1 in the bioreactor respectively indicated that the buildup of salinity from 10 20 g l 1 did not have a significant impact on the biological process due to the use of halophilic microorganisms also it was evident that the difference between the cod in the feed solution and bioreactor was the outcome of the combination of adsorption and biological degradation by the microorganisms flocs 34 the cod values in the draw solution were less than 20 mg l 1 which showed a 98 cod removal due to the high rejection characteristics of the fo membrane in the mbr studies a cod reduction of 83 was reported with the use of halophilic microorganisms due to the lower rejection of the ultrafiltration membrane 6 as shown in fig 5 the cod of the bioreactor at the end of each cycle in the a series experiments 5 periods 20 days gradually increased to 480 511 567 613 and 581 mg l also the o g concentration in the ombr raised during four cycles to 45 6 49 5 50 2 52 9 as stated before the residual cod and o g in the bioreactor was probably related to the accumulation of non hard biodegradation components of the crude oil as well as the production of soluble microbial products smp as a result of microbial growth 6 34 nevertheless after 20 days of the ombr operation series b experiments the final cod in the bioreactor in each cycle became smaller equivalent to 492 472 446 and 437 mg l 1 and o g concentration declined to 41 5 36 8 32 6 26 mg l according to the structure of the fo membrane the amount of o g in the draw solution was negligible in addition it decreased from and 215 mg l 1 bioreactor influent to less than 25 mg l 1 in bioreactor effluent by the activity of microorganisms most of the environmental regulations propose a daily or monthly maximum limit for o g discharge into the aquatic environment but none for cod for instance based on the us environmental protection agency usepa regulations the maximum daily limit for o g and its monthly average is set as 42 and 29 mg l 1 respectively 6 this phenomenon clearly showed the development of the halophilic microorganisms resistance against the increase in salinity and reached a steady condition it is also interesting to note that the interplay between the biodegradation and physical separation by the fo membrane played an essential role in cod removal in the ombr in fact the rejection of the organic compounds by the forward osmosis membrane would prolong their retention time in the bioreactor and facilitate higher biodegradation 23 high oil rejection was seen in the ombr system governed by the non porous structure of the fo membrane the cod levels in the draw solution fell in the range of 15 21 5 mg l 1 and more than 98 of cod removal was achieved when compared with the inﬂuent cod 1500 mg l 1 of the ombr system the high rejection of organic components in the present study was consistent with earlier reports for the treatment of wastewater with an ombr system 23 30 31 it is worth noting that the amount of salinity in those studies was meager and the salt accumulation in the bioreactor that was due to the reverse salt flux from the draw solution affected the microbial activity over time 26 29 another research which employed a membrane bioreactor mbr for treatment of pw reported that the cod removal efficiency was approximately 87 for olr 1 2 kg cod m 3d 1 tds 64 4 g l 1 this difference might be due to the use of an fo membrane with an ro membrane like structure instead of the microﬁltration membrane 6 the cod values in the feed solution remained within the range of 400 500 mg l 1during the operation time therefore two thirds fraction of the influent cod was reduced in the ombr operation this result indicates that ombr might be used as a pretreatment of produced water the pw effluent of ombr could be further treated to remove the remaining oil grease content and then could be desalinated by a suitable method the clean salty pw might also be discharged to the ocean re inject to the oil well or discharge to the evaporation pond 3 3 water flux performance of ombr the variation of water flux during the operation time in the ombr system is illustrated in fig 6 as mentioned in the previous section the ombr operation was carried out for 36 days and each vertical line in fig 6 represents a new cycle the initial cod and tds of the feed solution synthetic pw were 1500 and 10 000 mg l 1 respectively a 1 5 m nacl solution with an osmotic pressure of 72 6 bar was used as the draw solution the water flux through the fo membrane showed a decreasing trend at each cycle the decline in the water flux in the ombr could be attributed to salt accumulation in the feed side as well as membrane fouling attachment of oil drops biofilm and biological products to the membrane surface feed salinity led to a decrease in water flux due to the counteracted part of the draw solution osmotic pressure thus resulting in a lower effective osmotic pressure and driving force 38 moreover as reported by others solutions with high ionic strength might de swell the cta membrane through charge neutralization within the polymer matrix leading to low water permeation 39 40 due to the high fo membrane capability for the rejection of solute in the bioreactor along with water permeation the electrical conductivity of the mixed liquor increased 15 30 ms cm 1 within four days and the water flux gradually decreased the conductivity in the ombr has an opposite trend of water flux fig 7 the conductivity raised from 15 30 ms cm 1 for the first three cycles of a series a i a ii and a iii however in the next periods a iv a v the water flux reduced due to membrane fouling led to decreasing the electrical conductivity in the ombr tank and it reached 28 ms cm 1 at the end of the a v cycle the same trend was repeated for cycles of b series after membrane cleaning membrane fouling is another reason that might result in the decline of membrane flux through the formation of hydraulic resistance in addition to the attachment of the biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps on the membrane surface fouling in the ombr might occur with the deposition of oil droplets on the membrane surface the water contact angle of the cta membrane increased from 49 5 for a new membrane to 70 after exposure to the pw containing cod 1000 mg l 1 the attachment of foulants onto the membrane surface enhanced the hydrophobic characteristics of the membrane and prevented water permeation across the membrane in addition the fouling layer hindered the salt transfer from the draw solution to the feed side therefore the salt concentration at the interface between the fouling layer and the membrane may increase and the net osmotic pressure decrease 41 according to fig 6 the membrane ﬂux decreased from the initial 5 83 to 4 63 lmh during the first cycle the drop in the flux was 0 4 lmh per day for the a i cycle and reached 0 36 and 0 34 lmh per day for the a ii and a iii cycles respectively the water flux generally declined in the initial cycles due to salt accumulation and the fouling of the fresh membrane after three cycles the drop in the water flux decreased to 0 27 lmh per day for the a iv cycle this trend showed that the fouling stabilized and the salt accumulation led to the decline in the water flux however for the v a cycle the water flux rate increased again to 0 35 lmh per day which could be attributed to accelerated cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop in this phenomenon the fouling layer might capture the draw solutes due to the reverse salt flux and resulted in a greater loss of the fo driving force 42 after membrane cleaning and removing the foulants on the membrane surface the water flux declined at a fast pace and reached 0 38 0 31 and 0 29 lmh per day for the b i b ii and b iii cycles respectively moreover it should be pointed out that the osmotic pressure created by fouling on the membrane surface could also affect the decline of the flux since this microbial fouling layer is negatively charged 41 and generally carries functional groups containing carboxyl amine phosphoric and hydroxyl groups a large number of counter ions exist within the membrane fouling for reaching electro neutrality therefore the formation of the fouling resulted in enhancing the osmotic pressure in the feed side and reducing the water flux it is also apparent in fig 6 that when the feed solution was refreshed after each cycle there was an increase in the water flux due to the reclamation of osmotic pressure nevertheless fouling gradually expanded during the ombr experiments which resulted in a decrease in the water flux after each refreshment the dashed line in fig 6 displays this phenomenon the slope of the dashed line at the a series 0 15 lmh per day and b series 0 18 lmh per day cycles could be attributed to the increasing membrane fouling in a biological environment therefore membrane cleaning should be periodically considered to maintain system operations by considering the average flux 4 lmh through the fo membrane nearly 0 48 l out of the 1 5 l feed solution transferred to the draw solution this indicated that 32 of the produced water volume was reduced in each cycle 3 4 membrane fouling the ombr system was intermittently aerated in an on off cycle 2 5 min to provide oxygen for the microorganisms and mitigate the fouling aeration assists in preventing the accumulation of foulant on the membrane surface by creating hydraulic disturbance near the membrane in addition it elevates local mixing reduces external concentration polarization and enhances the water flux 43 44 however the presence of oil drops in synthetic pw as well as eps deposited on the membrane surface could not easily be detached by air bubbling the ombr was operated for 20 days in five cycles without any membrane cleaning the membrane fouling and cake layer formation after four cycles caused a reduction of the water flux from 5 8 to 3 7 lmin 1 h 1 therefore osmotic backward washing and chemical cleaning were carried out to remove the foulants on the membrane surface the performance of the fo membrane was tested using di water as the feed solution in order to better understand the effect of each cleaning method for membrane foulant removal the resulting water fluxes are shown by the red triangle symbols in fig 6 which can be compared to the initial membrane flux the osmotic backwashing method could only recover 73 of the initial water flux fig 6 due to the secure attachment of oil droplets microbial derived organic matters onto the membrane surface fig 8 shows the sem images of the fouled membrane by the oil droplets exposure to the pw containing cod 1000 mg l 1 and without the presence of microorganisms the images indicate that most of the foulants were removed from the membrane surface by the backwashing method and the contact angle decreased from 75 to 67 however foulants on the surface can be seen therefore the backwashing was followed by a chemical cleaning method and the water flux could be recovered to 86 of the initial flux the chemical treatment was successful in removing most of the foulants attached to the membrane surface so that the sem image obtained for the membrane surface after the chemical treatment is similar to the fresh membrane and the membrane contact angle was reduced to 55 the presence of sds with a hydrophobic tail in the cleaning solution facilitates the removal of the oil droplets from the membrane surface and leads to an increase in water flux recovery sds may solubilize macromolecules in water by forming micelles around them or absorb the organics by the hydrophobic tails thereby facilitates the removal of foulants from the membrane surface it is worth mentioning ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta and naoh solution are also effective cleaning agents at high ph for eliminating foulant from the fo membrane surface 22 since the cta membrane used in this study has a limited tolerant ph range of 3 8 the sds solution was more suitable for this purpose 4 conclusions the combination of biological treatment and the high rejection of the fo membrane in the ombr indicated a 98 cod removal from saline pw besides the cod and o g values of pw decreased from 1500 mg l 1 and 215 mg l 1 bioreactor influent to less than 450 mg l 1 and 25 mg l 1 in bioreactor effluent respectively in addition approximately 30 of the influent volume of pw was reduced during the operation time of the ombr these achievements showed that the ombr using halophilic microorganisms and draw solution of the ro brine could be used as a pretreatment for the reduction of organic loading and volume of pw in the other hand permeated water reduces the salinity of ro brine to deal with the environmental effects of its disposal

removal rate and settlement rate in coagulation flocculation process keywords adsorption coagulation and flocculation graphene oxide toc water treatment 1 introduction population growth economic development changing lifestyles and the industrialization have led to emerging of a wide range of physical and chemical pollutants threatening the environment in many areas providing adequate water has become increasingly difficult both for drinking industrial and environmental purposes 1 4 natural organic matter nom is a wide range of organic materials found in natural waters natural water often containing noms is used as the primary source for drinking water purposes 5 the properties and characteristics of nom in water with different origins and biogeochemical cycles depend on surrounding environments 6 besides the range of organic components may also vary seasonally in the same place 7 the main components of nom are humic substances polysaccharides lipids protein substances such as low molecular acids fulvic acids phenols and organic peroxides and other classes of organic molecules 8 10 many studies indicates that the hydrophobic portion of nom primarily leads to the formation of carcinogenic dbps i e trihalomethanes thms in chlorinated drinking water furthermore the presence of nom in drinking water has many undesired effects such as unpleasant odour colour and taste of water 11 13 nom is one of the main components of total organic carbon toc that present natural organic matter generally toc contains carbon atoms except co2 and related substances such as carbonate and bicarbonate organic carbon is an energy layer for many microorganisms and helps reduce the water s inadequate oxygen supply the insufficient oxygen content of water bodies thereby threatening the life of aquatic organisms 14 15 by now various methods of toc removal have been reported such as coagulation flocculation photocatalytic treatment electrocoagulation and oxidation amoung which the coagulation flocculation process is considered as a simple method in removing organic matter 16 18 generally the use of chemical reagents can destabilise and increase the size of the particles a physical separation of the solids from the liquid phase alum sulfate alum polyaluminum chloride pac and ferric chloride fecl3 are considered as the most common coagulants in the coagulation flocculation process 19 this separation is usually achieved by sedimentation decantation flotation or filtration 16 18 recently many researchers have focused on the application of nanomaterials in the water purification process the main advantage of nanomaterials is their large surface area and various functionalized groups 20 22 remarkable studies have concentrated on the carbon based nanomaterials for water treatment because of their unique properties 23 graphite oxide go is the oxidized form of graphene which is acquired easily from the oxidation of graphite go contains various oxygen based functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy groups which improve the dispersibility of go and are essential for the removal of some pollutants from water in this work go was applied to evaluate the interaction between the removal of toc and turbidity through absorption method magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 are good candidates for the development of high adsorbents according to the surface modification to increase their selectivity affinity for reducing or eliminating chemical ions and microbes present in water 23 24 in this study

stock 1000 mg l a certain amount of the humic acid was dissolved in deionized water 2 6 experimental design and data analysis for toc and turbidity removal the box behnken design bbd technique is a three level fractional factorial design consisting of three interlocked 22 factorial designs and a center point which could reduce the number of required experiments by comparing the bbd with other response surface designs like central composite and three level full factorial design it was demonstrated that bbd is slightly more efficient than the central composite design and much more efficient than the three level full factorial designs another advantage of the bbd is that it does not contain points at which all factors are simultaneously at their highest or lowest levels 28 29 bbd technique under rsm was applied to determine the values of the parameters for optimizing removal rate of toc and turbidity in order to assess the effects of parameters on the adsorption three main

predicted results are demonstrated in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go the fe sem images of go is displayed in fig 1 a d the layered structure has been observed with graphene s high transparency feature there is also much wrinkle on the margins of graphene which represents the go layer property according to dls analysis the average pore diameter of go is about 565 nm the ftir spectroscopy was applied for characterizing go which is shown in fig 1e the absorption peak at 3413 cm 1 3475 cm 1 and 3236 cm 1 indicates the presence of hydroxyl groups oh stretching vibrations 31 32 the two peaks at 1384 cm 1 and 1040 cm 1 are identified to be related to hydroxyl groups finally the wavenumber of 621 cm 1 corresponds to the epoxy coc stretching mode 33 the xrd results of go and graphite are illustrated in fig 1f this peak was completely disappeared in go and a new peak appeared at 2ɵ 8 45 and also graphite pattern depicted a sharp peak at 26 77 34 35 3 2 characterization of fe3o4 fe sem analysis of fe3o4 was carried out to investigate the morphology of magnetic nanoparticles and to determine its size and dimensions during the synthesis process fig 2 a d shows the images related to the fe sem analysis moreover the average pore diameter of fe3o4 nanoparticle was reported at almost 2030 nm xrd peaks fig 2e at 2θ of 30 4 35 6 43 3 57 3 and 62 8 show good consistency with the reported data and can be indexed to the pure phase of fe3o4 structure 36 measurement of magnetic properties of magnetic iron nanoparticles was determined using a vibrational sample magnetometer vsm with the application of a magnetic field of 10 000 to 10 000 everest oe at ambient temperature fig 2f shows the magnetic residual curve of the sample according to the maximum magnetic saturation chart these nanoparticles have a magnetic saturation of 50 emu g the comparison of these values indicates the desired magnetic property of magnetic nanoparticles 37 3 3 statistical analysis the empirical relationship which is presented by an equation with the interactive expressions between the experimental results based on the box behnken design model and the appropriate input variables was analyzed the final equation for eliminating toc is obtained from the following coded factors 4 y 92 48 1 16 a 8 57 b 31 06 c 1 2 a c 8 42 b c 1 66 a 2 2 34 b 2 59 42 c 2 the p value quantifies the discrepancy between the data and a null hypothesis of interest usually the assumption of no difference or no effect f value indicates whether the test is statistically significant or not the f value is used in the analysis of variance anova it is calculated by dividing two mean squares the higher f value and the less p value means the significance of the test the verification of the variables and model was conducted using the analysis of the variance anova table 3 the model f value of 2091 91 indicates the effectiveness of this model the p value of all the coefficients is p 0 05 which implies these are insignificant the results of the analysis of the variance anova for turbidity removal are reported in table 4 5 y 7 6 1 125 a 9 b 35 13 c 1 5 a c 8 25 b c 1 7 a 2 2 45 b 2 63 2 c 2 3 4 the influence of interactions among independent variables the perturbation plot obtained using eq 4 indicates that the toc removal rate was profoundly affected by the dose of fecl3 6h2o fig 3 a the toc removal rate remained constant with the ph changes on the other hand as the concentration of go and fecl3 6h2o increased the toc removal rate raised however the impact of the concentration of fecl3 6h2o was more significant than that of the concentration of go it can also be seen from the results of eq 5 depicted in fig 3b that fecl3 had the most impact on the turbidity removal and also the concentration of go and ph had the least effect the impact of the concentration of fecl3 6h2o the concentration of go and solution ph on the toc removal rate is depicted in fig 3c e the toc removal rate raised with increasing the concentration of go and fecl3 6h2o and remained constant by changing ph according to fig 3c e in a constant amount of go maximum toc removal rate can see within the range of 30 mg l to 53 mg l while the impact of ph is negligible the maximum removal rate was obtained 97 6 at the solution ph of 7 go concentration of 11 mg l and the fecl3 6h2o concentration of 35 mg l also the effects of concentration of fecl3 6h2o and go and solution ph on the turbidity removal rate is depicted in fig 3d f the concentration of fecl3 6h2o between 35 mg l to 47 mg l and 11 mg l of go can make the best removal rate of turbidity 95 3 according to the predicted removal rate in the prediction intervals at a p value of 0 05 94 0 100 2 validation of the model is approved 3 5 the effect of tds table 5 indicates the composition of the tds stock solution in order to evaluate the effect of tds on toc and turbidity removal rate a range of zero to 1000 mg l was selected and results are shown in fig 4 while the tds impact on the turbidity removal rate was significant it had a minor interaction with the toc removal rate at various levels of tds 3 6 the effect of fe3o4 on sedimentation rate fig 5 shows the turbidity graph regarding time which indicates the sedimentation of particles with time as shown in the diagram the concentration of fe3o4 had a significant effect on the rate and time of particle settling therefore by changing the fe3o4 concentration from zero to 60 0 mg l a considerable reduction in the turbidity was observed by using fe3o4 according to fig 5 almost less than 5 min the turbidity reached below 5 ftu however turbidity without using fe3o4 at the same time was about 140 ftu 3 7 equilibrium studies the adsorption isotherm shows that when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium the adsorption molecules are distributed between the liquid phase and the solid phase in order to calculate the equilibrium of adsorption process different isotherm equations were conducted such as redlich peterson 38 ut 39 radke prausnitz 29 freundlich 40 langmuir 41 dubinin radushkevich 42 and temkin 43 fig 6 a shows the extent to which the experimental data are consistent with different isotherms as well as the residual plots of investigated adsorption models are illustrated in fig 6 b fig 6 the calculated parameters of adsorption models are provided in table 7 the error function is used to evaluate the accuracy of various models table 6 according to r2 values and rmse redlich peterson ut isotherm radke prausnitz models appear to be more accurate than other models the correlation coefficients for the radke prausnitz ut and redlich peterson isotherm is 0 9996 also the numerical values of rl tests are within the range of zero to 1 which shows optimal adsorption using the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated 1608 mg g 4 conclusion in this study toc and turbidity removal rates were investigated in the coagulation flocculation process by go and fecl3 6h 2 o in which fe3o4 was used to increase the sedimentation rate because of the significant removal rates using go and fecl 3 6h 2 o is a practical way in water treatment units experiments were designed using the design expert software at three different levels of ph go and coagulant doses fecl 3 6h 2 o also the effect of various concentrations of tds on the removal rates was investigated therefore in case getting the best removal results it is better the tds solution to be at low levels by analyzing the results of experiments the following can be stated among the parameters fecl 3 6h 2 o and go have had the most significant impact on the removal of turbidity and toc respectively the ph parameter had the least effect on the remained turbidity and the removal of toc by raising the concentration of fecl 3 6h 2 o the percentage of removed toc was increased however at concentrations between 35 and 50 mg l of fecl 3 6h 2 o the experiments showed the highest removal rate also with the combined use of go and fecl 3 6h 2 o the percentage of toc removal generally was raised for optimizing the removal rate concentrations between 35 to 45 mg l of fecl 3 6h 2 o and values greater than 11 mg l of go were obtained generally by increasing tds the percentage of removed toc was reduced the removal rate when the concentration of tds was 50 mg l and between 600 and 800 mg l was about 96 4 and 80 respectively also by increasing tds the remained turbidity in the solutions was increased the concentration of fe3o4 had remarkable effects on the rate and time of particle settling as a result at the higher concentration up to 60 mg l a significant decrease in turbidity was observed declaration of competing interest

substances such as low molecular acids fulvic acids phenols and organic peroxides and other classes of organic molecules 8 10 many studies indicates that the hydrophobic portion of nom primarily leads to the formation of carcinogenic dbps i e trihalomethanes thms in chlorinated drinking water furthermore the presence of nom in drinking water has many undesired effects such as unpleasant odour colour and taste of water 11 13 nom is one of the main components of total organic carbon toc that present natural organic matter generally toc contains carbon atoms except co2 and related substances such as carbonate and bicarbonate organic carbon is an energy layer for many microorganisms and helps reduce the water s inadequate oxygen supply the insufficient oxygen content of water bodies thereby threatening the life of aquatic organisms 14 15 by now various methods of toc removal have been reported such as coagulation flocculation photocatalytic treatment electrocoagulation and oxidation amoung which the coagulation flocculation process is considered as a simple method in removing organic matter 16 18 generally the use of chemical reagents can destabilise and increase the size of the particles a physical separation of the solids from the liquid phase alum sulfate alum polyaluminum chloride pac and ferric chloride fecl3 are considered as the most common coagulants in the coagulation flocculation process 19 this separation is usually achieved by sedimentation decantation flotation or filtration 16 18 recently many researchers have focused on the application of nanomaterials in the water purification process the main advantage of nanomaterials is their large surface area and various functionalized groups 20 22 remarkable studies have concentrated on the carbon based nanomaterials for water treatment because of their unique properties 23 graphite oxide go is the oxidized form of graphene which is acquired easily from the oxidation of graphite go contains various oxygen based functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy groups which improve the dispersibility of go and are essential for the removal of some pollutants from water in this work go was applied to evaluate the interaction between the removal of toc and turbidity through absorption method magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 are good candidates for the

three level fractional factorial design consisting of three interlocked 22 factorial designs and a center point which could reduce the number of required experiments by comparing the bbd with other response surface designs like central composite and three level full factorial design it was demonstrated that bbd is slightly more efficient than the central composite design and much more efficient than the three level full factorial designs another advantage of the bbd is that it does not contain points at which all factors are simultaneously at their highest or lowest levels 28 29 bbd technique under rsm was applied to determine the values of the parameters for optimizing removal rate of toc and turbidity in order to assess the effects of parameters on the adsorption three main

predicted results are demonstrated in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go the fe sem images of go is displayed in fig 1 a d the layered structure has been observed with graphene s high transparency feature there is also much wrinkle on the margins of graphene which represents the go layer property according to dls analysis the average pore diameter of go is about 565 nm the ftir spectroscopy was applied for characterizing go which is shown in fig 1e the absorption peak at 3413 cm 1 3475 cm 1 and 3236 cm 1 indicates the presence of hydroxyl groups oh stretching vibrations 31 32 the two peaks at 1384 cm 1 and 1040 cm 1 are identified to be related to hydroxyl groups finally the wavenumber of 621 cm 1 corresponds to the epoxy coc stretching mode 33 the xrd results of go and graphite are illustrated in fig 1f this peak was completely disappeared in go and a new peak appeared at 2ɵ 8 45 and also graphite pattern depicted a sharp peak at 26 77 34 35 3 2 characterization of fe3o4 fe sem analysis of fe3o4 was carried out to investigate the morphology of magnetic nanoparticles and to determine its size and dimensions during the synthesis process fig 2 a d shows the images related to the fe sem analysis moreover the average pore diameter of fe3o4 nanoparticle was reported at almost 2030 nm xrd peaks fig 2e at 2θ of 30 4 35 6 43 3 57 3 and 62 8 show good consistency with the reported data and can be indexed to the pure phase of fe3o4 structure 36 measurement of magnetic properties of magnetic iron nanoparticles was determined using a vibrational sample magnetometer vsm with the application of a magnetic field of 10 000 to 10 000 everest oe at ambient temperature fig 2f shows the magnetic residual curve of the sample according to the maximum magnetic saturation chart these nanoparticles have a magnetic saturation of 50 emu g the comparison of these values indicates the desired magnetic property of magnetic nanoparticles 37 3 3 statistical analysis the empirical relationship which is presented by an equation with the interactive expressions between the experimental results based on the box behnken design model and the appropriate input variables was analyzed the final equation for eliminating toc is obtained from the following coded factors 4 y 92 48 1 16 a 8 57 b 31 06 c 1 2 a c 8 42 b c 1 66 a 2 2 34 b 2 59 42 c 2 the p value quantifies the discrepancy between the data and a null hypothesis of interest usually the assumption of no difference or no effect f value indicates whether the test is statistically significant or not the f value is used in the analysis of variance anova it is calculated by dividing two mean squares the higher f value and the less p value means the significance of the test the verification of the variables and model was conducted using the analysis of the variance anova table 3 the model f value of 2091 91 indicates the effectiveness of this model the p value of all the coefficients is p 0 05 which implies these are insignificant the results of the analysis of the variance anova for turbidity removal are reported in table 4 5 y 7 6 1 125 a 9 b 35 13 c 1 5 a c 8 25 b c 1 7 a 2 2 45 b 2 63 2 c 2 3 4 the influence of interactions among independent variables the perturbation plot obtained using eq 4 indicates that the toc removal rate was profoundly affected by the dose of fecl3 6h2o fig 3 a the toc removal rate remained constant with the ph changes on the other hand as the concentration of go and fecl3 6h2o increased the toc removal rate raised however the impact of the concentration of fecl3 6h2o was more significant than that of the concentration of go it can also be seen from the results of eq 5 depicted in fig 3b that fecl3 had the most impact on the turbidity removal and also the concentration of go and ph had the least effect the impact of the concentration of fecl3 6h2o the concentration of go and solution ph on the toc removal rate is depicted in fig 3c e the toc removal rate raised with increasing the concentration of go and fecl3 6h2o and remained constant by changing ph according to fig 3c e in a constant amount of go maximum toc removal rate can see within the range of 30 mg l to 53 mg l while the impact of ph is negligible the maximum removal rate was obtained 97 6 at the solution ph of 7 go concentration of 11 mg l and the fecl3 6h2o concentration of 35 mg l also the effects of concentration of fecl3 6h2o and go and solution ph on the turbidity removal rate is depicted in fig 3d f the concentration of fecl3 6h2o between 35 mg l to 47 mg l and 11 mg l of go can make the best removal rate of turbidity 95 3 according to the predicted removal rate in the prediction intervals at a p value of 0 05 94 0 100 2 validation of the model is approved 3 5 the effect of tds table 5 indicates the composition of the tds stock solution in order to evaluate the effect of tds on toc and turbidity removal rate a range of zero to 1000 mg l was selected and results are shown in fig 4 while the tds impact on the turbidity removal rate was significant it had a minor interaction with the toc removal rate at various levels of tds 3 6 the effect of fe3o4 on sedimentation rate fig 5 shows the turbidity graph regarding time which indicates the sedimentation of particles with time as shown in the diagram the concentration of fe3o4 had a significant effect on the rate and time of particle settling therefore by changing the fe3o4 concentration from zero to 60 0 mg l a considerable reduction in the turbidity was observed by using fe3o4 according to fig 5 almost less than 5 min the turbidity reached below 5 ftu however turbidity without using fe3o4 at the same time was about 140 ftu 3 7 equilibrium studies the adsorption isotherm shows that when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium the adsorption molecules are distributed between the liquid phase and the solid phase in order to calculate the equilibrium of adsorption process different isotherm equations were conducted such as redlich peterson 38 ut 39 radke prausnitz 29 freundlich 40 langmuir 41 dubinin radushkevich 42 and temkin 43 fig 6 a shows the extent to which the experimental data are consistent with different isotherms as well as the residual plots of investigated adsorption models are illustrated in fig 6 b fig 6 the calculated parameters of adsorption models are provided in table 7 the error function is used to evaluate the accuracy of various models table 6 according to r2 values and rmse redlich peterson ut isotherm radke prausnitz models appear to be more accurate than other models the correlation coefficients for the radke prausnitz ut and redlich peterson isotherm is 0 9996 also the numerical values of rl tests are within the range of zero to 1 which shows optimal adsorption using the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated 1608 mg g 4 conclusion in this study toc and turbidity removal rates were investigated in the coagulation flocculation process by go and fecl3 6h 2 o in which fe3o4 was used to increase the sedimentation rate because of the significant removal rates using go and fecl 3 6h 2 o is a practical way in water treatment units experiments were designed using the design expert software at three different levels of ph go and coagulant doses fecl 3 6h 2 o also the effect of various concentrations of tds on the removal rates was investigated therefore in case getting the best removal results it is better the tds solution to be at low levels by analyzing the results of experiments the following can be stated among the parameters fecl 3 6h 2 o and go have had the most significant impact on the removal of turbidity and toc respectively the ph parameter had the least effect on the remained turbidity and the removal of toc by raising the concentration of fecl 3 6h 2 o the percentage of removed toc was increased however at concentrations between 35 and 50 mg l of fecl 3 6h 2 o the experiments showed the highest removal rate also with the combined use of go and fecl 3 6h 2 o the percentage of toc removal generally was raised for optimizing the removal rate concentrations between 35 to 45 mg l of fecl 3 6h 2 o and values greater than 11 mg l of go were obtained generally by increasing tds the percentage of removed toc was reduced the removal rate when the concentration of tds was 50 mg l and between 600 and 800 mg l was about 96 4 and 80 respectively also by increasing tds the remained turbidity in the solutions was increased the concentration of fe3o4 had remarkable effects on the rate and time of particle settling as a result at the higher concentration up to 60 mg l a significant decrease in turbidity was observed declaration of competing interest

13868,in this study we fabricated bmo mnb1 beads by encapsulating biogenic manganese oxide bmo and pseudomonas putida mnb1 into a calcium alginate hydrogel matrix and evaluated its possible use as a novel material for removing 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 from aqueous environments a response surface methodology rsm was used to investigate the individual and interaction effects of the four independent encapsulation conditions i e sodium alginate concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size on the removal efficiency of ee2 to obtain optimal encapsulation products the effects of different experimental conditions i e ph temperature initial ee2 concentration and bmo mnb1 bead concentration on the removal of ee2 were also examined the reusability of bmo mnb1 beads was also studied in comparison with free bmo and p putida mnb1 and purified bmo the results suggested that the optimal conditions for the preparation of bmo mnb1 beads were the sodium alginate concentration of 3 the cacl2 concentration of 0 2 m the curing time of 3 h and the bead size of 2 5 mm successful fabrication of bmo mnb1 beads was confirmed via optical microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis initial ph initial ee2 concentration bead concentration and temperature markedly affected the ee2 removal rates by the bmo mnb1 beads the bmo mnb1 beads exhibited good separation and satisfactory reusability they could be recycled up to 14 times without obvious changes in the bead structure this study demonstrates that encapsulation of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate beads can be an excellent strategy with great efficiency and reusability and high potential for industrial applications for ee2 removal keywords biogenic manganese oxide encapsulation pseudomonas putida mnb1 response surface methodology 17α ethinylestradiol 1 introduction recently endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs have received increasing attention from regulatory agencies as a serious public health issue due to their adverse effects on human endocrine systems 1 2 among the edcs 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 a synthetic estrogen compound has become a widespread problem in aquatic environments because of its high resistance to degradation and its tendency to accumulate in sediment and concentrate in biota 3 4 ee2 is commonly used in contraceptives and medicines for the treatment of osteoporosis menstrual disorders breast cancer and prostate cancer 5 previous studies reported that 4 5 and 6 μg of ee2 are excreted daily per capita in urine and feces respectively and an approximately 720 kg of ee2 is released yearly into the environment solely from contraceptive pill practices 6 the occurrence of ee2 in water environment has been found with a concentration ranging from 0 05 831 ng ee2 l 7 9 ee2 is known to be much more persistent than other natural estrogens such as estrone e1 estradiol e2 and estriol e3 and it is considered as main cause for estrogenic activity in wastewater treatment effluents 10 the estrogenic potency in vitro tests of ee2 are about 2 3 fold and 11 130 fold higher compared to e2 and e1 respectively 11 the toxic potential of ee2 to exposed organisms has been well reported to cause long term effects by altering sex determination delaying sexual maturity and decreasing secondary sexual characteristics 11 in an effort to prevent the adverse effects of ee2 on aquatic environments various technologies have been studied as potential treatment methods for the effective removal of ee2 of these biogenic manganese oxides bmos produced by manganese oxidizing bacteria mob has attracted considerable interest as a promising catalyst and oxidant to detoxify a wide range of recalcitrant organic contaminants 12 15 the reaction of manganese oxides mno2 with organic pollutants has been reported as surface dependent reaction that can be promoted by increasing the number of surface reactive sites 16 in this respect bmos offer perspectives due to their nano sized particles 4 100 nm and high specific surface area 98 224 m2 g which is 2 4 times higher than that of chemically prepared mno2 3 17 as a result it was reported that bmo has higher reactivity with organic pollutants than chemically prepared mno2 with a factor of 10 at neutral ph 18 previous studies were successfully used the bmos produced by mob pseudomonas putida strain p putida mnb1 3 19 20 p putida mnb6 20 21 p putida mnb29 and leptothrix discophora 20 to effectively remove ee2 it is noteworthy that biological oxidation rate of mn ii to form bmo by p putida mnb1 is faster than that by other mobs 19 21 moreover our recent work has explored that the biological activity of p putida mnb1 together with the abiotic reaction by bmos actively contributed to the ee2 removal 3 p putida mnb1 itself has been proven incapable of degrading ee2 however under the synergistic effects of bmo and p putida mnb1 a 15 fold higher removal of ee2 was observed than with bmo alone 3 it therefore seems clear that an engineered technology using bmo incorporated p putida mnb1 can be developed as a promising system for bioremediation of environments contaminated with recalcitrant organic pollutants one approach that promotes the respective roles of p putida mnb1 and bmos is immobilizing particulate bmo and p putida mnb1 on supported materials or encapsulating them within protective shells cell immobilization has attracted great attention in the area of biological wastewater treatment because of its high metabolic activity high cell density per volume of reactor the long term stability of the cells and the possibility of maintaining and regenerating biocatalysts 22 23 cell immobilization is defined as the physical detention or localization of microbial cells to reduce their movement while still maintaining their microbial activities 24 different immobilizing methods have been developed of which attachment and entrapment are the two primary types 25 26 cell attachment is based on the physical interaction between the microorganisms and the surface of carriers and is similar to the adsorption of colloid particles typically a biofilm on a solid material although cell attachment has been the preferred method of immobilization for wastewater treatment due to its simplicity and the reusability of the support materials its drawbacks include a long period for cell adaptation and cells washing out from the treatment system due to the constant flow of water over the time 25 in this context entrapment of cells into a hydrogel matrix can overcome these drawbacks as well as protect microorganisms from grazing by protozoa 27 cell encapsulation has been widely used as a biotechnology tool to solve the technological problems derived from handling and cell based applications this involves immobilization of the cells within a polymeric gel that permits the preservation of their metabolic activity typically entrapment can improve mechanical stability and minimize cell leaching 28 in addition with entrapment the encapsulating material can be modified which enables an optimal microenvironment for enhancing cell viability and maintenance 29 31 entrapment in hydrogel capsules is of particular interest because they have a unique three dimensional 3d network with a porous structure allowing the free diffusion of substrates without influencing the normal functions of the cells 32 alginate hydrogel capsules have been widely studied because of their extremely mild and simple fabrication under room temperature and their biocompatibility non toxicity and cost effectiveness which improve their feasibility for industrial applications 33 alginate is a natural anionic polysaccharide composed of repeated units of 1 4 linked β d mannuronate m and its c 5 epimer α l guluronate g residues 34 alginate capsules are usually fabricated by the crosslinking of guluronic acid with mannuronic acid residues with many divalent or multivalent cations especially ca ii the 3d network structure of the hydrogel formed by the coordination of ca ii cations between adjacent alginate chains follow the egg box model 34 with this approach successful encapsulation of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate hydrogel beads bmo mnb1 beads can be developed as an excellent alternative and robust environmental remediation technique our expectation is that such encapsulation can reduce p putida mnb1 microbial sensitivity to harsh environmental conditions e g ph nutrients and competitive bacteria hence promoting their survival in addition p putida mnb1 can preserve its metabolic activity over long term operation in this respect p putida mnb1 together with bmos is able to actively contribute to pollutant removal via production of the mn iii intermediate and it re oxidizes the mn ii released from the reaction of ee2 and bmos generating new mn iii intermediates or bmos therefore this study was undertaken to optimize the encapsulation of bmos and p putida mnb1 in sodium alginate beads bmo mnb1 beads and to test its potential application as a novel material for removing ee2 in aquatic environments for optimal encapsulation conditions four independent variables i e alginate concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size were evaluated via a response surface methodology rsm for their individual and combined effects on the removal of ee2 the surface morphologies and physico chemical properties of the bmo mnb1 beads were characterized to verify the success of the fabrication procedure the effects of the experimental conditions i e ph temperature initial ee2 concentration and bmo mnb1 bead concentration on the ee2 removal efficiency were also examined the reusability of encapsulated bmo mnb1 beads was also studied and compared with free bmos and p putida mnb1 not encapsulated and purified bmos 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials preparation 2 1 1 mn oxidizing bacterium and cultures

aliquot samples were collected at given time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter milliporesigma measurements were taken by high performance liquid chromatography hplc younglin

rate of 1 ml min to describe the kinetics of the ee2 removal we analyzed the experimental results with pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption kinetics models eqs 1 and 2 1 ln c t ln c 0 k 1 t 2 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where c t and c 0 mg l are the ee2 concentration at a given time t and time zero respectively k 1 1 h is the pseudo first order rate constant k 2 l mg h is the pseudo second order rate constant and t h is time for optimal encapsulation conditions an rsm was used to investigate the individual and interaction effects of the four independent encapsulation factors i e naalg concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size on the removal efficiency of ee2 24 in this study the rsm was analyzed based on the box behnken design bbd procedure of the design expert

f test the probability value p value and the determination coefficient r 2 for evaluating the goodness of fit regression mode 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of encapsulation conditions according to ee2 removal test 3 1 1 experimental results in this study four important encapsulation parameters affecting the fabrication of the bmo mnb1 beads i e naalg concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size were carefully studied to find the most effective procedure for preparing an optimal structure of bmo mnb1 beads capable of greater performance for ee2 removal fig 1 a b presents the effect of different concentrations of naalg 1 6 on the removal of ee2 results from control tests revealed that alginate beads were not able to adsorb ee2 hence ee2 removal in the bmo mnb1 bead system was obviously due to its reaction with encapsulated bmo and p putida mnb1 the ee2 removal rates decreased when the concentration of naalg increased which might have resulted from the fact that beads of smaller pore size formed at higher concentrations of naalg which hindered the diffusion of the ee2 into the beads to react with the encapsulated bmo mnb1 42 however low concentrations of naalg resulted in the production of soft and fragile beads with a large pore size leading to an increased percentage of cell leakage during the experiments as presented in fig 1 b hence the 2 3 concentration of naalg was the optimal level for preparing the bmo mnb1 beads additionally ee2 removal in these experiments showed better fits to the pseudo first order reaction kinetic equation eq 1 than to the pseudo second order reaction kinetic equation eq 2 tables s1 s4 the effects of cacl2 concentration on the removal of ee2 are presented in fig 1 c d when the dosage of calcium increased the ee2 removal rates significantly decreased previous studies reported that high concentration of calcium chloride caused a change in ph which was responsible for the decrease in the cell activity inside the microenvironment of the beads 42 in addition the reactive surface sites of bmos might be blocked by excessive ca ii contributing to a more significant passivation of the bmos and subsequently resulting in a further reduction of ee2 oxidation 3 12 moreover a high percentage of cell leakage also occurred during these experiments as shown in fig 2 d which is attributed to the low concentration of ca ii that caused the formation of soft and fragile beads with large pore sizes considering the ee2 removal efficiency and the percentage of cell leakage we found that a 0 2 m concentration of cacl2 was the optimal level for fabricating the bmo mnb1 beads we also investigated the bead curing time for the efficient synthesis of a stable bead structure the maximum ee2 removal rate was achieved when the beads were exposed to the cacl2 solution for approximately 3 h as shown in fig 1 e f it was previously reported that fragile beads are formed when the beads are not soaked in the hardening solution for an optimal time however the immobilization yield can be reduced due to prolonged bead curing times causing cell leakage 42 further when the beads are embedded in the hardening solution for a relatively long time period passivation of bmo by ca ii can occur thus reducing the ee2 removal rate the size of the fabricated beads is a major factor that affects the stability and efficiency for the removal of pollutants the bead size is designed during the manufacturing process in this study different sizes of beads 1 5 5 mm were made using different sizes of needles large bead sizes resulted in lower ee2 removal rates as shown in fig 1 g h conversely smaller beads have a collectively larger surface area for ee2 to readily attach to and diffuse inside the beads in order to react with bmos 43 for these reasons we found that ee2 could be removed faster and more thoroughly with smaller beads in fig 1 h the bead sizes of 1 5 2 5 mm provide favorable conditions not only in terms of the substrate and ee2 diffusion from the matrix but also cell leakage as compared to other sizes 3 1 2 rsm analysis results in this study the individual and interaction effects of four encapsulation condition factors on the removal of ee2 were investigated by a polynomial quadratic as suggested by the design expert software and the final empirical model was expressed as in eq 4 4 y 0 111 0 008x1 0 016x2 0 009x3 0 024x4 0 007x1x2 0 005x1x3 0 010x1x4 0 004x2x3 0 012x2x4 0 002x3x4 0 007x1 2 0 003x2 2 0 022x3 2 0 017x4 2 where y represents the ee2 removal rate constants k1 as a function of naalg concentration x1 cacl2 concentration x2 curing time x3 and bead size x4 the negative signs indicate the antagonistic effects whereas the positive signs indicate the synergistic effects 39 based on eq 4 the anova of ee2 removal is given in table s5 the result shows that the f test 21 31 had a very low probability value p 0 0001 indicating that the model was highly significant 40 additionally p values of less than 0 05 indicated which model terms were significant in this case x1 x2 x3 x4 x1x4 x2x4 x3 2 and x4 2 were significant implying that these terms played an important role in the fabrication of the bmo mnb1 beads for later use to remove ee2 furthermore we observed a linear relationship between the experimental results and the predicted ee2 removal rate constants k1 obtained from the quadratic expression given in eq 4 r 2 0 958 as shown in fig 2 the goodness of fit of the model was checked by the determination coefficient r 2 of 95 8 suggesting that 95 8 of the total variation in the removal of ee2 can be described by the above quadratic model 44 the adjusted determination coefficient r adj 2 was found to be 0 913 implying that only 8 7 cannot be explained by this model also this r adj 2 value was still satisfactory for confirming the significance of the model 41 44 fig 3 depicts the impact of the interactions between any two independent variables on the removal of ee2 in 3d response surface plots high ee2 removal rates were achieved when the concentration of naalg was maintained at approximately 1 3 fig 3 a b c along with a cacl2 concentration of 0 1 0 2 m fig 3 a d e a curing time of 2 3 h fig 3 b d f and a bead size of 1 2 5 mm fig 3 c e f 3 1 3 selection of optimal encapsulation conditions in consideration of the results obtained from the rsm analysis and the percentage of cell leakage obtained in the actual experiments the optimal encapsulation conditions determined for the fabrication of the bmo mnb1 beads in this work are presented in table 1 3 1 4 product properties 3 1 4 1 surface morphologies fig 4 shows the photographs and microscopy images of the wet alginate and bmo mnb1 beads typically the beads were perfectly spherical and had a smooth surface with an approximate diameter of 2 5 mm as expected the encapsulated bmo mnb1 beads turned black due to the color of the bmo during air drying the beads were reduced in size when dried the surface morphologies of the prepared beads were characterized by fe sem as shown in fig 5 a d the sem images of the alginate bead compared with bmo mnb1 bead show a difference in surface morphology the alginate beads displayed a smooth surface with some cracks which were probably caused by partial collapse of the polymer network during drying 35 the smoothness decreased as ripples developed when bmo mnb1 was encapsulated into the beads according to the edx mapping images of the prepared beads shown in fig 5 e f the alginate beads consisted of only c o ca cl and p elements whereas an extra mn element was created and uniformly distributed within the bmo mnb1 beads these results demonstrate the successful fabrication of the targeted bmo mnb1 beads 3 1 4 2 physico chemical properties fig 6 shows that the phpzc of the alginate beads decreased from ph 7 05 to 5 72 when the bmo and p putida mnb1 were encapsulated into the beads a previous study reported the phpzc of pure alginate beads as 7 91 35 this suggests that the presence of bmo and p putida mnb1 resulted in a lower phpzc hence the bmo mnb1 beads might have a higher adsorptive capacity for ee2 as well as metal ions compared to pure alginate beads we expect that mn ii released from the bmo during oxidative degradation of ee2 into the bulk solution can either be re adsorbed and diffused through the alginate shell toward the p putida mnb1 or continually re oxidized to generate new mn iii intermediates or new bmo to provide additional ee2 removal this will be evaluated and discussed in more detail in section 3 3 below the physico chemical properties of the prepared beads are depicted in table 2 it can be seen that the swelling ratio of the bmo mnb1 beads is significantly lower than that of the alginate beads which was confirmed by the larger size of the dried bmo mnb1 beads compared to the alginate beads zhuang et al 45 reported that the mechanical properties of hydrogels are notably affected by their degree of swelling and that a high swelling ratio could drastically weaken the mechanical strength with a lower swelling ratio the mechanical toughness of the bmo mnb1 beads improved after the encapsulation process which led to improved structural stability during the reaction 45 3 2 influence of environmental factors on the removal of ee2 3 2 1 effect of ph the ph of the aqueous solution is an important parameter to control the degradation rate of ee2 because it affects not only the surface charge of the bmo mnb1 beads but also the ee2 chemistry the effect of initial ph on ee2 removal is presented in fig 7 a showing that the initial ph notably affected the ee2 removal rate by the bmo mnb1 beads the ee2 removal rate decreased with the increase of ph values since the reduction of bmo to mn ii requires the participation of protons high h at low ph levels improved the potential for mno2 reduction and ee2 oxidation in addition the pka of ee2 was found to be 10 33 46 in acidic solutions ee2 molecules are neutral but they become negatively charged under alkaline conditions although the phpzc of the bmo mnb1 beads was 5 72 in this study in an acidic environment ph phpzc higher ee2 adsorption efficiency would be expected in contrast ee2 has similar charges to the surface charge of bmo mnb1 beads resulting in mutual repulsion under alkaline conditions which results in lower or no ee2 removal 3 2 2 effect of temperature as presented in fig 7 b ee2 removal increased as the temperature increased this might have been due to high temperature causing reduced ee2 hydrophobicity 12 the increased mobility of ee2 leads to an increased ee2 diffusion rate toward the inside of the beads and thus an increase in the reaction rate with the bmo previous studies also reported that the microbial activity of cells immobilized into an alginate hydrogel matrix was improved at higher temperature because the reorganized enzyme molecules attained a structure that enabled them to maintain their reactivity 42 46 3 2 3 effect of initial ee2 concentration fig 7 c shows that the ee2 removal rate was inversely proportional to the ee2 concentration at lower concentrations all of the ee2 presented in the reactor could interact with the binding sites of the bmo resulting in a higher removal rate and efficiency 12 in contrast at higher concentrations the amount of ee2 was excessive for the active sites of the bmo which lessened the removal of ee2 by the bmo mnb1 beads 3 2 4 effect of initial bead concentration the removal rates of ee2 versus the quantity of bmo mnb1 beads is shown in fig 7 d the ee2 degradation rates were proportional to bead concentration this could be ascribed to the hypothesis that as the bead amount is increased a higher bmo concentration is provided making more active sites available for ee2 thus enhancing the removal rate 3 3 reusability test 3 3 1 removal of ee2 the stability of the bmo mnb1 beads during the degradation of ee2 is an important concern for practical applications it is necessary to examine the long term stability of the beads to see whether they can be successfully reused in several batch processes fig 8 depicts the reusability of the bmo mnb1 beads free bmo mnb1 in suspension and purified bmo for the removal of ee2 in the absence of p putida mnb1 the purified bmo had a lower ee2 removal efficiency compared to the others only 10 of the ee2 was removed after seven experimental cycles this result is based on the following grounds 1 the reduction of bmo to mn ii during the ee2 oxidation led to a decrease in the amount of available bmo as the reaction progressed 2 the released mn ii adsorbed on the active sites of the bmo caused passivation of the bmo and 3 bmo loss during sampling and separation from the reaction mixture left less of it for subsequent reuse 3 on the other hand comparison of the ee2 removal rates between encapsulated and suspended bmo mnb1 showed lower initial removal rates for the bmo mnb1 beads as illustrated in fig 8 this can be explained by the fact that the alginate shell acted as like physical membrane that consequently built up a diffusion barrier which inhibited the ee2 removal rate 47 48 however as the reusability tests were repeated we observed similar ee2 degradation efficiencies for the free and encapsulated bmo mnb1 at the end of each cycle evidently indicating that the diffusion permeation rate became negligible to the overall performance 49 these results also suggest that confinement of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate beads reduces their mobility without sacrificing their reactivity 47 it is noteworthy that alginate beads itself play no role in the oxidation or adsorption of ee2 and thereby the mechanism of ee2 removal from bmo mnb1 beads might be similar to that in the free bmo mnb1 system the oxidative mechanism of ee2 by bmo in the presence of p putida mnb1 has been extensively studied and discussed in our previous work 3 we clarified that bmo oxidizes ee2 through a surface dependent reaction accordingly ee2 is initially bound to the bmo surface to form a precursor complex electron transfer reduces mn iv to mn ii within this associated surface complex followed by the release of ee2 oxidation products and mn ii from the bmo surface as shown in eq 5 in the presence of active p putida mnb1 the mn ii released from the reduction of bmo is re oxidized to generate active mn iii intermediates or new bmo which provides additional ee2 removal the active mn iii intermediates directly oxidizes ee2 by transferring an electron and releasing mn ii as presented in eq 6 5 mno2 4h 2e mn ii 2h2o 6 mn iii e mn ii the removal rates of ee2 by the bmo mnb1 beads decreased progressively as the number of cycles increased but not significantly as illustrated in fig 9 a slight reduction in the ee2 removal efficiency was observed during first 10 cycles furthermore almost no mn ii leaching from the bmo mnb1 beads during the oxidation of ee2 to the bulk solution was observed suggesting that the released mn ii can either be re adsorbed and diffused through the alginate shell toward the p putida mnb1 or continually re oxidized to generate new mn iii intermediates or new bmo these results indicate that the bmo mnb1 beads are stable during the reaction previous studies reported that encapsulation can ensure better stability and contacts between contaminants and encapsulated material 47 and the durability of the bmo mnb1 beads was confirmed in our study by the fact that no obvious change in the bead structure was detected even after 14 cycles in contrast with the free bmo mnb1 a drastic decrease of the ee2 removal rate was continuously observed after each cycle we found that the ee2 removal rate and efficiency by the free bmo mnb1 was lower than by the bmo mnb1 beads after 12 sequential cycles which could have been caused by the loss of bmo and cells during sampling and separation from the treated solution for reuse moreover the fast and easy separation of materials is very crucial for practical application while the use of free bmo mnb1 in water treatment is limited because nano sized bmo is not only difficult to separate from treated water but also has environmental toxicity 12 the bmo mnb1 beads which is of reasonable size for easier separation could be an alternative method to overcome the limitation these results demonstrate that encapsulation of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate beads is an excellent strategy with great efficiency easy separation and reusability which is high potential for industrial applications for ee2 removal 3 3 2 bmo retention and cell leakage relating to the stability of the bmo mnb1 beads the amount of bmo and the number of cells retained inside the beads during the reaction with ee2 are significant factors affecting the performance of the removal process after seven cycles of observation by the total mn mass balance method there was no obvious change in the amount of entrapped bmo as shown in fig 10 this indicates that the bmo kept regenerating inside the beads by the active support of existing p putida mnb1 this result is consistent with the observation that almost no mn ii was leached from the bmo mnb1 beads after the reaction with ee2 during first 10 cycles considering the drinking water standards of korean government the manganese ion concentration detected in the effluent solution is far lower than the legal limit 0 3 mg l 50 51 suggesting that treated effluent could be directly discharged into bodies of water however there was a bmo reduction of 12 8 after 14 cycles which might have been related to the leakage of cells during the operation we found that 23 8 and 32 9 of p putida mnb1 had leaked out from the beads after 7 and 14 cycles respectively this phenomenon is reportedly common due to the large porous structure of the alginate beads hence an additional step to modify the alginate structure to reduce cell leakage might be needed for further industrial applications 4 conclusions in this work spherical bmo mnb1 beads were successfully prepared by encapsulating bmo and p putida mnb1 into a calcium alginate hydrogel matrix based on experimental results and rsm analysis the optimal encapsulation conditions were 3 naalg 0 2 m cacl2 2 5 mm bead size and a curing time of 3 h the removal of ee2 by the bmo mnb1 beads was dramatically influenced by experimental conditions i e the ph of the solution the initial ee2 concentration the bmo mnb1 bead concentration and the temperature in addition the bmo mnb1 beads showed remarkable stability and recycling efficiency for ee2 removal compared to free bmo mnb1 and purified bmo in summary the easy to fabricate bmo mnb1 beads have excellent reactivity and recycling efficiency giving them great application potential for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants from aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the

13868,in this study we fabricated bmo mnb1 beads by encapsulating biogenic manganese oxide bmo and pseudomonas putida mnb1 into a calcium alginate hydrogel matrix and evaluated its possible use as a novel material for removing 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 from aqueous environments a response surface methodology rsm was used to investigate the individual and interaction effects of the four independent encapsulation conditions i e sodium alginate concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size on the removal efficiency of ee2 to obtain optimal encapsulation products the effects of different experimental conditions i e ph temperature initial ee2 concentration and bmo mnb1 bead concentration on the removal of ee2 were also examined the reusability of bmo mnb1 beads was also studied in comparison with free bmo and p putida mnb1 and purified bmo the results suggested that the optimal conditions for the preparation of bmo mnb1 beads were the sodium alginate concentration of 3 the cacl2 concentration of 0 2 m the curing time of 3 h and the bead size of 2 5 mm successful fabrication of bmo mnb1 beads was confirmed via optical microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis initial ph initial ee2 concentration bead concentration and temperature markedly affected the ee2 removal rates by the bmo mnb1 beads the bmo mnb1 beads exhibited good separation and satisfactory reusability they could be recycled up to 14 times without obvious changes in the bead structure this study demonstrates that encapsulation of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate beads can be an excellent strategy with great efficiency and reusability and high potential for industrial applications for ee2 removal keywords biogenic manganese oxide encapsulation pseudomonas putida mnb1 response surface methodology 17α ethinylestradiol 1 introduction recently endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs have received increasing attention from regulatory agencies as a serious public health issue due to their adverse effects on human endocrine systems 1 2 among the edcs 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 a synthetic estrogen compound has become a widespread problem in aquatic environments because of its high resistance to degradation and its tendency to accumulate in sediment and concentrate in biota 3 4 ee2 is commonly used in contraceptives and medicines for the treatment of osteoporosis menstrual disorders breast cancer and prostate cancer 5 previous studies reported that 4 5 and 6 μg of ee2 are excreted daily per capita in urine and feces respectively and an approximately 720 kg of ee2 is released yearly into the environment solely from contraceptive pill practices 6 the occurrence of ee2 in water environment has been found with a concentration ranging from 0 05 831 ng ee2 l 7 9 ee2 is known to be much more persistent than other natural estrogens such as estrone e1 estradiol e2 and estriol e3 and it is considered as main cause for estrogenic activity in wastewater treatment effluents 10 the estrogenic potency in vitro tests of ee2 are about 2 3 fold and 11 130 fold higher compared to e2 and e1 respectively 11 the toxic potential of ee2 to exposed organisms has been well reported to cause long term effects by altering sex determination delaying sexual maturity and decreasing secondary sexual characteristics 11 in an effort to prevent the adverse effects of ee2 on aquatic environments various technologies have been studied as potential treatment methods for the effective removal of ee2 of these biogenic manganese oxides bmos produced by manganese oxidizing bacteria mob has attracted considerable interest as a promising catalyst and oxidant to detoxify a wide range of recalcitrant organic contaminants 12 15 the reaction of manganese oxides mno2 with organic pollutants has been reported as surface dependent reaction that can be promoted by increasing the number of surface reactive sites 16 in this respect bmos offer perspectives due to their nano sized particles 4 100 nm and high specific surface area 98 224 m2 g which is 2 4 times higher than that of chemically prepared mno2 3 17 as a result it was reported that bmo has higher reactivity with organic pollutants than chemically prepared mno2 with a factor of 10 at neutral ph 18 previous studies were successfully used the bmos produced by mob pseudomonas putida strain p putida mnb1 3 19 20 p putida mnb6 20 21 p putida mnb29 and leptothrix discophora 20 to effectively remove ee2 it is noteworthy that biological oxidation rate of mn ii to form bmo by p putida mnb1 is faster than that by other mobs 19 21 moreover our recent work has explored that the biological activity of p putida mnb1 together with the abiotic reaction by bmos actively contributed to the ee2 removal 3 p putida mnb1 itself has been proven incapable of degrading ee2 however under the synergistic effects of bmo and p putida mnb1 a 15 fold higher removal of ee2 was observed than with bmo alone 3 it therefore seems clear that an engineered technology using bmo incorporated p putida mnb1 can be developed as a promising system for bioremediation of environments contaminated with recalcitrant organic pollutants one approach that promotes the respective roles of p putida mnb1 and bmos is immobilizing particulate bmo and p putida mnb1 on supported materials or encapsulating them within protective shells cell immobilization has attracted great attention in the area of biological wastewater treatment because of its high metabolic activity high cell density per volume of reactor the long term stability of the cells and the possibility of maintaining and regenerating biocatalysts 22 23 cell immobilization is defined as the physical detention or localization of microbial cells to reduce their movement while still maintaining their microbial activities 24 different immobilizing methods have been developed of which attachment and entrapment are the two primary types 25 26 cell attachment is based on the physical interaction between the microorganisms and the surface of carriers and is similar to the adsorption of colloid particles typically a biofilm on a solid material although cell attachment has been the preferred method of immobilization for wastewater treatment due to its simplicity and the reusability of the support materials its drawbacks include a long period for cell adaptation and cells washing out from the treatment system due to the constant flow of water over the time 25 in this context entrapment of cells into a hydrogel matrix can overcome these drawbacks as well as protect microorganisms from grazing by protozoa 27 cell encapsulation has been widely used as a biotechnology tool to solve the technological problems derived from handling and cell based applications this involves immobilization of the cells within a polymeric gel that permits the preservation of their metabolic activity typically entrapment can improve mechanical stability and minimize cell leaching 28 in addition with entrapment the encapsulating material can be modified which enables an optimal microenvironment for enhancing cell viability and maintenance 29 31 entrapment in hydrogel capsules is of particular interest because they have a unique three dimensional 3d network with a porous structure allowing the free diffusion of substrates without influencing the normal functions of the cells 32 alginate hydrogel capsules have been widely studied because of their extremely mild and simple fabrication under room temperature and their biocompatibility non toxicity and cost effectiveness which improve their feasibility for industrial applications 33 alginate is a natural anionic polysaccharide composed of repeated units of 1 4 linked β d mannuronate m and its c 5 epimer α l guluronate g residues 34 alginate capsules are usually fabricated by the crosslinking of guluronic acid with mannuronic acid residues with many divalent or multivalent cations especially ca ii the 3d network structure of the hydrogel formed by the coordination of ca ii cations between adjacent alginate chains follow the egg box model 34 with this approach successful encapsulation of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate hydrogel beads bmo mnb1 beads can be developed as an excellent alternative and robust environmental remediation technique our expectation is that such encapsulation can reduce p putida mnb1 microbial sensitivity to harsh environmental conditions e g ph nutrients and competitive bacteria hence promoting their survival in addition p putida mnb1 can preserve its metabolic activity over long term operation in this respect p putida mnb1 together with bmos is able to actively contribute to pollutant removal via production of the mn iii intermediate and it re oxidizes the mn ii released from the reaction of ee2 and bmos generating new mn iii intermediates or bmos therefore this study was undertaken to optimize the encapsulation of bmos and p putida mnb1 in sodium alginate beads bmo mnb1 beads and to test its potential application as a novel material for removing ee2 in aquatic environments for optimal encapsulation conditions four independent variables i e alginate concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size were evaluated via a response surface methodology rsm for their individual and combined effects on the removal of ee2 the surface morphologies and physico chemical properties of the bmo mnb1 beads were characterized to verify the success of the fabrication procedure the effects of the experimental conditions i e ph temperature initial ee2 concentration and bmo mnb1 bead concentration on the ee2 removal efficiency were also examined the reusability of encapsulated bmo mnb1 beads was also studied and compared with free bmos and p putida mnb1 not encapsulated and purified bmos 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials preparation 2 1 1 mn oxidizing bacterium and cultures

times with autoclaved deionized water diw followed by centrifugation to remove other organics and impurities then re suspended in autoclaved diw part of this bmo mnb1 suspension was purified to obtain purified bmo the purification procedure is described in detail in tran et al 3 another part of the suspension was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for further use and named as free bmo mnb1 the rest of the suspension was used for encapsulating into the alginate beads 2 1 3 encapsulation of p putida mnb1 and bmo into the alginate beads naalg and cacl2 solutions were prepared in diw at concentrations

erlenmeyer flasks duran at 26 c and 150 rpm in a wis 20 shaking incubator daihan scientific co ltd korea an ee2 stock solution was prepared in methanol ch3oh which was stored at 4 c and diluted before use ee2 removal tests were performed via serial batch experiments and the initial concentrations of ee2 and beads were 2 mg l and 10 g l respectively unless otherwise noted the reactor volume was 100 ml and the initial ph of the solution was 5 6 although the selected initial ee2 concentration does not represent that expected to find in the water environment this study was intended to investigate the performance of the bmo mnb1 beads in wastewater containing a variety of pollutants other than the target pollutant ee2 at high concentrations also these experiments were designed to produce

phpzc was determined as the point at which the initial ph and final ph values were equal and was obtained from the plot of final versus initial ph values 35 swelling of the beads was recorded by the water evaporation method 37 a desired amount of beads had excess water removed with kimberly clark professional wipes and was subsequently weighed then it was dehydrated at 37 c in an oven until it was a constant mass the swelling of the beads was computed from the changes in the bead mass to determine of encapsulated cell concentration the total numbers of encapsulated cells within the beads

rate of 1 ml min to describe the kinetics of the ee2 removal we analyzed the experimental results with pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption kinetics models eqs 1 and 2 1 ln c t ln c 0 k 1 t 2 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where c t and c 0 mg l are the ee2 concentration at a given time t and time zero respectively k 1 1 h is the pseudo first order rate constant k 2 l mg h is the pseudo second order rate constant and t h is time for optimal encapsulation conditions an rsm was used to investigate the individual and interaction effects of the four independent encapsulation factors i e naalg concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size on the removal efficiency of ee2 24 in this study the rsm was analyzed based on the box behnken design bbd procedure of the design expert

f test the probability value p value and the determination coefficient r 2 for evaluating the goodness of fit regression mode 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of encapsulation conditions according to ee2 removal test 3 1 1 experimental results in this study four important encapsulation parameters affecting the fabrication of the bmo mnb1 beads i e naalg concentration cacl2 concentration curing time and bead size were carefully studied to find the most effective procedure for preparing an optimal structure of bmo mnb1 beads capable of greater performance for ee2 removal fig 1 a b presents the effect of different concentrations of naalg 1 6 on the removal of ee2 results from control tests revealed that alginate beads were not able to adsorb ee2 hence ee2 removal in the bmo mnb1 bead system was obviously due to its reaction with encapsulated bmo and p putida mnb1 the ee2 removal rates decreased when the concentration of naalg increased which might have resulted from the fact that beads of smaller pore size formed at higher concentrations of naalg which hindered the diffusion of the ee2 into the beads to react with the encapsulated bmo mnb1 42 however low concentrations of naalg resulted in the production of soft and fragile beads with a large pore size leading to an increased percentage of cell leakage during the experiments as presented in fig 1 b hence the 2 3 concentration of naalg was the optimal level for preparing the bmo mnb1 beads additionally ee2 removal in these experiments showed better fits to the pseudo first order reaction kinetic equation eq 1 than to the pseudo second order reaction kinetic equation eq 2 tables s1 s4 the effects of cacl2 concentration on the removal of ee2 are presented in fig 1 c d when the dosage of calcium increased the ee2 removal rates significantly decreased previous studies reported that high concentration of calcium chloride caused a change in ph which was responsible for the decrease in the cell activity inside the microenvironment of the beads 42 in addition the reactive surface sites of bmos might be blocked by excessive ca ii contributing to a more significant passivation of the bmos and subsequently resulting in a further reduction of ee2 oxidation 3 12 moreover a high percentage of cell leakage also occurred during these experiments as shown in fig 2 d which is attributed to the low concentration of ca ii that caused the formation of soft and fragile beads with large pore sizes considering the ee2 removal efficiency and the percentage of cell leakage we found that a 0 2 m concentration of cacl2 was the optimal level for fabricating the bmo mnb1 beads we also investigated the bead curing time for the efficient synthesis of a stable bead structure the maximum ee2 removal rate was achieved when the beads were exposed to the cacl2 solution for approximately 3 h as shown in fig 1 e f it was previously reported that fragile beads are formed when the beads are not soaked in the hardening solution for an optimal time however the immobilization yield can be reduced due to prolonged bead curing times causing cell leakage 42 further when the beads are embedded in the hardening solution for a relatively long time period passivation of bmo by ca ii can occur thus reducing the ee2 removal rate the size of the fabricated beads is a major factor that affects the stability and efficiency for the removal of pollutants the bead size is designed during the manufacturing process in this study different sizes of beads 1 5 5 mm were made using different sizes of needles large bead sizes resulted in lower ee2 removal rates as shown in fig 1 g h conversely smaller beads have a collectively larger surface area for ee2 to readily attach to and diffuse inside the beads in order to react with bmos 43 for these reasons we found that ee2 could be removed faster and more thoroughly with smaller beads in fig 1 h the bead sizes of 1 5 2 5 mm provide favorable conditions not only in terms of the substrate and ee2 diffusion from the matrix but also cell leakage as compared to other sizes 3 1 2 rsm analysis results in this study the individual and interaction effects of four encapsulation condition factors on the removal of ee2 were investigated by a polynomial quadratic as suggested by the design expert software and the final empirical model was expressed as in eq 4 4 y 0 111 0 008x1 0 016x2 0 009x3 0 024x4 0 007x1x2 0 005x1x3 0 010x1x4 0 004x2x3 0 012x2x4 0 002x3x4 0 007x1 2 0 003x2 2 0 022x3 2 0 017x4 2 where y represents the ee2 removal rate constants k1 as a function of naalg concentration x1 cacl2 concentration x2 curing time x3 and bead size x4 the negative signs indicate the antagonistic effects whereas the positive signs indicate the synergistic effects 39 based on eq 4 the anova of ee2 removal is given in table s5 the result shows that the f test 21 31 had a very low probability value p 0 0001 indicating that the model was highly significant 40 additionally p values of less than 0 05 indicated which model terms were significant in this case x1 x2 x3 x4 x1x4 x2x4 x3 2 and x4 2 were significant implying that these terms played an important role in the fabrication of the bmo mnb1 beads for later use to remove ee2 furthermore we observed a linear relationship between the experimental results and the predicted ee2 removal rate constants k1 obtained from the quadratic expression given in eq 4 r 2 0 958 as shown in fig 2 the goodness of fit of the model was checked by the determination coefficient r 2 of 95 8 suggesting that 95 8 of the total variation in the removal of ee2 can be described by the above quadratic model 44 the adjusted determination coefficient r adj 2 was found to be 0 913 implying that only 8 7 cannot be explained by this model also this r adj 2 value was still satisfactory for confirming the significance of the model 41 44 fig 3 depicts the impact of the interactions between any two independent variables on the removal of ee2 in 3d response surface plots high ee2 removal rates were achieved when the concentration of naalg was maintained at approximately 1 3 fig 3 a b c along with a cacl2 concentration of 0 1 0 2 m fig 3 a d e a curing time of 2 3 h fig 3 b d f and a bead size of 1 2 5 mm fig 3 c e f 3 1 3 selection of optimal encapsulation conditions in consideration of the results obtained from the rsm analysis and the percentage of cell leakage obtained in the actual experiments the optimal encapsulation conditions determined for the fabrication of the bmo mnb1 beads in this work are presented in table 1 3 1 4 product properties 3 1 4 1 surface morphologies fig 4 shows the photographs and microscopy images of the wet alginate and bmo mnb1 beads typically the beads were perfectly spherical and had a smooth surface with an approximate diameter of 2 5 mm as expected the encapsulated bmo mnb1 beads turned black due to the color of the bmo during air drying the beads were reduced in size when dried the surface morphologies of the prepared beads were characterized by fe sem as shown in fig 5 a d the sem images of the alginate bead compared with bmo mnb1 bead show a difference in surface morphology the alginate beads displayed a smooth surface with some cracks which were probably caused by partial collapse of the polymer network during drying 35 the smoothness decreased as ripples developed when bmo mnb1 was encapsulated into the beads according to the edx mapping images of the prepared beads shown in fig 5 e f the alginate beads consisted of only c o ca cl and p elements whereas an extra mn element was created and uniformly distributed within the bmo mnb1 beads these results demonstrate the successful fabrication of the targeted bmo mnb1 beads 3 1 4 2 physico chemical properties fig 6 shows that the phpzc of the alginate beads decreased from ph 7 05 to 5 72 when the bmo and p putida mnb1 were encapsulated into the beads a previous study reported the phpzc of pure alginate beads as 7 91 35 this suggests that the presence of bmo and p putida mnb1 resulted in a lower phpzc hence the bmo mnb1 beads might have a higher adsorptive capacity for ee2 as well as metal ions compared to pure alginate beads we expect that mn ii released from the bmo during oxidative degradation of ee2 into the bulk solution can either be re adsorbed and diffused through the alginate shell toward the p putida mnb1 or continually re oxidized to generate new mn iii intermediates or new bmo to provide additional ee2 removal this will be evaluated and discussed in more detail in section 3 3 below the physico chemical properties of the prepared beads are depicted in table 2 it can be seen that the swelling ratio of the bmo mnb1 beads is significantly lower than that of the alginate beads which was confirmed by the larger size of the dried bmo mnb1 beads compared to the alginate beads zhuang et al 45 reported that the mechanical properties of hydrogels are notably affected by their degree of swelling and that a high swelling ratio could drastically weaken the mechanical strength with a lower swelling ratio the mechanical toughness of the bmo mnb1 beads improved after the encapsulation process which led to improved structural stability during the reaction 45 3 2 influence of environmental factors on the removal of ee2 3 2 1 effect of ph the ph of the aqueous solution is an important parameter to control the degradation rate of ee2 because it affects not only the surface charge of the bmo mnb1 beads but also the ee2 chemistry the effect of initial ph on ee2 removal is presented in fig 7 a showing that the initial ph notably affected the ee2 removal rate by the bmo mnb1 beads the ee2 removal rate decreased with the increase of ph values since the reduction of bmo to mn ii requires the participation of protons high h at low ph levels improved the potential for mno2 reduction and ee2 oxidation in addition the pka of ee2 was found to be 10 33 46 in acidic solutions ee2 molecules are neutral but they become negatively charged under alkaline conditions although the phpzc of the bmo mnb1 beads was 5 72 in this study in an acidic environment ph phpzc higher ee2 adsorption efficiency would be expected in contrast ee2 has similar charges to the surface charge of bmo mnb1 beads resulting in mutual repulsion under alkaline conditions which results in lower or no ee2 removal 3 2 2 effect of temperature as presented in fig 7 b ee2 removal increased as the temperature increased this might have been due to high temperature causing reduced ee2 hydrophobicity 12 the increased mobility of ee2 leads to an increased ee2 diffusion rate toward the inside of the beads and thus an increase in the reaction rate with the bmo previous studies also reported that the microbial activity of cells immobilized into an alginate hydrogel matrix was improved at higher temperature because the reorganized enzyme molecules attained a structure that enabled them to maintain their reactivity 42 46 3 2 3 effect of initial ee2 concentration fig 7 c shows that the ee2 removal rate was inversely proportional to the ee2 concentration at lower concentrations all of the ee2 presented in the reactor could interact with the binding sites of the bmo resulting in a higher removal rate and efficiency 12 in contrast at higher concentrations the amount of ee2 was excessive for the active sites of the bmo which lessened the removal of ee2 by the bmo mnb1 beads 3 2 4 effect of initial bead concentration the removal rates of ee2 versus the quantity of bmo mnb1 beads is shown in fig 7 d the ee2 degradation rates were proportional to bead concentration this could be ascribed to the hypothesis that as the bead amount is increased a higher bmo concentration is provided making more active sites available for ee2 thus enhancing the removal rate 3 3 reusability test 3 3 1 removal of ee2 the stability of the bmo mnb1 beads during the degradation of ee2 is an important concern for practical applications it is necessary to examine the long term stability of the beads to see whether they can be successfully reused in several batch processes fig 8 depicts the reusability of the bmo mnb1 beads free bmo mnb1 in suspension and purified bmo for the removal of ee2 in the absence of p putida mnb1 the purified bmo had a lower ee2 removal efficiency compared to the others only 10 of the ee2 was removed after seven experimental cycles this result is based on the following grounds 1 the reduction of bmo to mn ii during the ee2 oxidation led to a decrease in the amount of available bmo as the reaction progressed 2 the released mn ii adsorbed on the active sites of the bmo caused passivation of the bmo and 3 bmo loss during sampling and separation from the reaction mixture left less of it for subsequent reuse 3 on the other hand comparison of the ee2 removal rates between encapsulated and suspended bmo mnb1 showed lower initial removal rates for the bmo mnb1 beads as illustrated in fig 8 this can be explained by the fact that the alginate shell acted as like physical membrane that consequently built up a diffusion barrier which inhibited the ee2 removal rate 47 48 however as the reusability tests were repeated we observed similar ee2 degradation efficiencies for the free and encapsulated bmo mnb1 at the end of each cycle evidently indicating that the diffusion permeation rate became negligible to the overall performance 49 these results also suggest that confinement of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate beads reduces their mobility without sacrificing their reactivity 47 it is noteworthy that alginate beads itself play no role in the oxidation or adsorption of ee2 and thereby the mechanism of ee2 removal from bmo mnb1 beads might be similar to that in the free bmo mnb1 system the oxidative mechanism of ee2 by bmo in the presence of p putida mnb1 has been extensively studied and discussed in our previous work 3 we clarified that bmo oxidizes ee2 through a surface dependent reaction accordingly ee2 is initially bound to the bmo surface to form a precursor complex electron transfer reduces mn iv to mn ii within this associated surface complex followed by the release of ee2 oxidation products and mn ii from the bmo surface as shown in eq 5 in the presence of active p putida mnb1 the mn ii released from the reduction of bmo is re oxidized to generate active mn iii intermediates or new bmo which provides additional ee2 removal the active mn iii intermediates directly oxidizes ee2 by transferring an electron and releasing mn ii as presented in eq 6 5 mno2 4h 2e mn ii 2h2o 6 mn iii e mn ii the removal rates of ee2 by the bmo mnb1 beads decreased progressively as the number of cycles increased but not significantly as illustrated in fig 9 a slight reduction in the ee2 removal efficiency was observed during first 10 cycles furthermore almost no mn ii leaching from the bmo mnb1 beads during the oxidation of ee2 to the bulk solution was observed suggesting that the released mn ii can either be re adsorbed and diffused through the alginate shell toward the p putida mnb1 or continually re oxidized to generate new mn iii intermediates or new bmo these results indicate that the bmo mnb1 beads are stable during the reaction previous studies reported that encapsulation can ensure better stability and contacts between contaminants and encapsulated material 47 and the durability of the bmo mnb1 beads was confirmed in our study by the fact that no obvious change in the bead structure was detected even after 14 cycles in contrast with the free bmo mnb1 a drastic decrease of the ee2 removal rate was continuously observed after each cycle we found that the ee2 removal rate and efficiency by the free bmo mnb1 was lower than by the bmo mnb1 beads after 12 sequential cycles which could have been caused by the loss of bmo and cells during sampling and separation from the treated solution for reuse moreover the fast and easy separation of materials is very crucial for practical application while the use of free bmo mnb1 in water treatment is limited because nano sized bmo is not only difficult to separate from treated water but also has environmental toxicity 12 the bmo mnb1 beads which is of reasonable size for easier separation could be an alternative method to overcome the limitation these results demonstrate that encapsulation of bmo and p putida mnb1 into alginate beads is an excellent strategy with great efficiency easy separation and reusability which is high potential for industrial applications for ee2 removal 3 3 2 bmo retention and cell leakage relating to the stability of the bmo mnb1 beads the amount of bmo and the number of cells retained inside the beads during the reaction with ee2 are significant factors affecting the performance of the removal process after seven cycles of observation by the total mn mass balance method there was no obvious change in the amount of entrapped bmo as shown in fig 10 this indicates that the bmo kept regenerating inside the beads by the active support of existing p putida mnb1 this result is consistent with the observation that almost no mn ii was leached from the bmo mnb1 beads after the reaction with ee2 during first 10 cycles considering the drinking water standards of korean government the manganese ion concentration detected in the effluent solution is far lower than the legal limit 0 3 mg l 50 51 suggesting that treated effluent could be directly discharged into bodies of water however there was a bmo reduction of 12 8 after 14 cycles which might have been related to the leakage of cells during the operation we found that 23 8 and 32 9 of p putida mnb1 had leaked out from the beads after 7 and 14 cycles respectively this phenomenon is reportedly common due to the large porous structure of the alginate beads hence an additional step to modify the alginate structure to reduce cell leakage might be needed for further industrial applications 4 conclusions in this work spherical bmo mnb1 beads were successfully prepared by encapsulating bmo and p putida mnb1 into a calcium alginate hydrogel matrix based on experimental results and rsm analysis the optimal encapsulation conditions were 3 naalg 0 2 m cacl2 2 5 mm bead size and a curing time of 3 h the removal of ee2 by the bmo mnb1 beads was dramatically influenced by experimental conditions i e the ph of the solution the initial ee2 concentration the bmo mnb1 bead concentration and the temperature in addition the bmo mnb1 beads showed remarkable stability and recycling efficiency for ee2 removal compared to free bmo mnb1 and purified bmo in summary the easy to fabricate bmo mnb1 beads have excellent reactivity and recycling efficiency giving them great application potential for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants from aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the

hydrocarbons s2 and nh4 n 14 simultaneous removals of hydrocarbons s2 and nh4 n by anoxic aerobic sequential series reactors is reported recently where s2 was removed in anoxic reactor and nh4 n was removed in aerobic reactor with residual organics 15 combined treatment of hydrocarbons and nh4 n in anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactors operated in series are reported 16 21 however studies involving the effect of salinity on the performance of bioreactors operated in series are not available the motivation of this study came from the absence of reported literatures involving the effect of salinity on the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater in addition there is lack of study about the operation of series reactors in saline condition while treating petroleum refinery wastewater

volatile solids was the sum of attached and suspended volatile solids 2 5 3 determination of biomass activity biomass activity was measured as heterotrophic activity ha and chemolithotrophic activity ca using a modified method 25 in three cycles ha was separately done for biomass of a1 and a2 and ca was done with a1 biomass only one gram biomass was collected for the determination of biomass activity the collected one gram biomass was in the same attached to suspended biomass ratio as available inside the reactors auxiliary nutrients such as yeast extract phosphate buffer and trace metals were not used to prevent biomass growth aspirator bottle 1 l having provision for gas and sample collection was used for ha analysis of anoxic biomass magnetic stirrer tarsons was used for mixing and sample was collected from the bottom port with a syringe at predetermined time intervals influent organics fraction of cod was calculated by correcting the interference due to s2 s2o3 2 and no2 mentioned elsewhere 15 hence feed cod to the anoxic biomass was maintained at 3000 mg o2 l using dextrose and no3 n of 1000 mg l similar to the feed of a1 reactor analysis of ha for aerobic biomass was done in a beaker 1 l with provision of aeration 2 l min feed cod was 2000 mg o2 l using dextrose same as cod of reactor a2 measurement of cod was done at predetermined time interval for 48 h and 16 h for a1 and a2 biomass respectively ca was done in a similar way by which ha of anoxic biomass was done feed to the anoxic biomass contained only s2 750 mg l and no3 n 1000 mg l activity was done in three cycles and data obtained in the third cycle was considered for the calculation of activity 25 ha cycles are illustrated in supplementary fig s2a and s2b and ca cycles are illustrated in supplementary fig s3 calculation of activity was done as per the following 4 a c t i v i t y m g g v s d a y s l o p e o f t h e l i n e a r i z e d p o r t i o n m g l h 24 h d a y t o t a l b i o m

chromatography dhruva gujrat india by thermal conductivity detector tcd 26 gas generated from a1 was passed through a solution of potassium hydroxide 1 m koh which absorbed h2s gas this h2s was determined in the form of molar s2 by methylene blue method 24 and converted to volume according to ideal gas law pv nrt 26 where p standard atmospheric pressure 1 bar v volume of the gas m3 n number

species in both a1 and a2 by pure culture analysis 27 cells isolated from a1 were subjected to degrade simulated pollutants in a 250 ml plastic conical flask with 100 ml working volume at different nacl dose conical flasks loaded with feed and biomass were kept in anoxic condition and shaken at 150 rpm and 30 c in a shaking incubator ict india final concentrations of the pollutants were measured after 48 h biomass isolated from a2 were subjected to degrade pollutant as per the effluent of a1 in glass beakers 250 ml at 100 ml working volume with aeration of 2 l min and varied nacl dose final concentrations of the pollutants were measured after 16 h 2 6 properties of the crude oil density viscosity and cod of the crude oil was measured as per mallick and chakraborty 2019c metals analysis of the crude oil was done by acid digestion method mentioned in mallick and chakraborty 2019a the properties of the crude oil is summarized in table 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect on reactor biomass attached biomass was maximum in a1 in the absence of nacl fig 2 a decrease in attached biomass and increase in suspended biomass were observed with increase in nacl dose suggesting sloughing of the anoxic biomass at high salinity presence of salts and increase in the ionic strength of water inhibited the catabolic and anabolic activity of the microbial community 28 and mineralization of feed source was hampered this led to endogenous respiration as well as rupture of cell biomass and resulted into sloughing srt of a1 decreased due to increased sloughing from discs and washing out of biomass with increase in salinity fig 2b anoxic biomass received the initial toxic load with high salinity and pollutants concentrations however aerobic biomass received comparatively lesser concentrations hence nacl had more profound effect on the anoxic biomass as change in the distribution of aerobic biomass was only observed beyond nacl concentration of 30 g l fig 2c whereas anoxic biomass was effected at three times lesser dose of nacl there was a decrease of 8 in the total anoxic biomass and 2 in the total aerobic biomass with increase in nacl from 0 g l to 45 g l srt of a2 was not affected up to 30 g l of nacl and decreased with further increase in nacl fig 2d total biomass of both a1 and a2 increased when nacl was reduced to 0 g l during recovery distribution of attached and suspended biomass in the total biomass of both a1 and a2 was observed to be similar as it was before the introduction of nacl this suggests full recovery of the reactor biomass after the withdrawal of nacl load 3 2 performance analysis of reactors 3 2 1 organics removal effluent phenol fig 3 a th fig 3b total cod codt fig 3c and organic cod codo fig 3d from a1 increased with increase in nacl corresponding decrease in removal efficiencies from 38 to 14 phenol 45 to 23 th 64 to 49 codt and 41 to 18 codo at 60 h hrt was observed decrease in srt had negative effect on the efficiency of a1 decrease in the removals of hydrocarbons beyond 10 g l of nacl 29 and decrease in cod removal at nacl dose of 8 g l 7 in anoxic condition has been previously reported similarly decrease in cod removal in a1 started with the introduction of 10 g l of nacl in the present study however negative effect of nacl up to 20 g l during removal of catechol by denitrification was reported 30 in the present study inhibition on organics degradation occurred at lower nacl dose due to the presence of much toxic compounds and high alkaline ph effluent of a1 was treated in a2 and effect of influent nacl on a2 was never observed up to 30 g l as complete removals of phenol fig 3a th fig 3b and codo fig 3d was observed at 20 h hrt with a total hrt of 80 h beyond nacl dose of 30 g l performance of a2 started to decline and overall efficiency of the a1 a2 system decreased aerobic degradation of poly aromatic hydrocarbons influent th 1419 mg l was hampered beyond nacl dose of 40 g l in a reported study 9 in the present study 30 g l of nacl caused problems for the aerobic biomass possibly due to the presence of hydrocarbons with higher density and viscosity and high ph increase in the final effluent of codt from the a1 a2 system was observed with increase in nacl fig 3c presence of more than 2 g l of cl could cause interference in the cod determination 24 hence overall cod removal decreased efficiency of both a1 and a2 for the removal of organics increased during the recovery phase nacl 0 g l and complete recovery of the reactors was achieved heterotrophic activity ha was analysed for both anoxic and aerobic biomass at every phase of nacl dose variation and activity cycles are illustrated in supplementary fig s1a and b ha of anoxic biomass was maximum in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in nacl fig 4 a ha of aerobic biomass was stable up to 30 g l nacl and decreased at higher concentrations fig 4b decrease in activity of both anoxic and aerobic biomass was reflected in the reactor efficiency as both srt and organics removal decreased at higher influent nacl concentrations hence ha of the reactor biomass had direct correlation with the organics degradation efficiency ha of both anoxic and aerobic biomass increased during the recovery period and were similar as they were before the introduction of nacl 3 2 2 sulfide removal influent and effluent concentrations of s2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 are illustrated in fig 5 and average concentrations are summarized in tables 5a and 5b effect of nacl dose and decrease in a1 reactor srt did not affect removal of s2 and complete removal of s2 occurred in a1 at 60 h hrt fig 5a effluent so4 2 decreased whereas s2o3 2 increased with increase in salinity levels in a1 fig 5a s2 to so4 2 conversion hampered with increase in nacl concentration and 38 of the removed s2 was converted to so4 2 at 45 g l of nacl dose partial degradation of s2 was supported by the increase in salinity as s2o3 2 conversion increased from 3 to 8 of the removed s2 with increase in nacl dose of 0 g l to 45 g l remaining of the removed s2 could attribute to the production of bio sulfur s calculated by mass balance of sulfur compounds 15 which increased form 49 54 with increase in nacl from 0 g l to 45 g l decrease in so4 2 and increase in s during oxidation of s2 influent 200 mg l in the presence of acetate in anoxic conditions with increase in nacl 0 70 g l has been reported 31 at 35 g l of nacl with 95 s2 removal efficiency 55 of the feed s2 was converted to s 31 however in the present study with feed s2 of 750 mg l 99 s2 removal was achieved with 52 converted to s both the results supported that higher salinity favored incomplete oxidation of s2 to s residual s2o3 2 was oxidized to so4 2 in a2 and effect of nacl was not observed fig 5b chemolithotrophic activity ca cycles are summarized in supplementary fig s2 ca was maximum in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in nacl fig 4c decrease in ca was the potential reason for the decrease in the complete oxidation of s2 to so4 2 and increase in the intermediate s0 and s2o3 2 when nacl dose was reduced to 0 g l in the recovery phase ca of anoxic biomass increased and recovered to its original state fig 4c 3 2 3 nitrogen removal complete removal of no3 n occurred in the absence of nacl fig 6 a decrease in the removals of phenol and th led to lesser utilization of the electron acceptor reduction of no3 n was hampered and partial degradation was enhanced as no2 n accumulation increased more than 1 5 times with increase in nacl from 0 to 45 g l in a1 tables 5a and 5b denitrification was calculated as per the following 5 d e n i t r i f i c a t i o n i n f n o 3 e f f n o 3 e f f n o 2 i n f n o 3 100 where inf no3 influent nitrate n mg l eff no3 effluent nitrate n mg l eff no2 effluent nitrite n mg l diversity of microbial community decreases in the presence of salinity and nitrite reductase gene was affected at high salt concentration 32 decrease in denitrifying community with increase in salinity during degradation of aromatic hydrocarbon has been reported 33 hence there was accumulation of no2 n in a1 with increase in nacl and denitrification efficiency decreased from 81 to 55 with increase in nacl from 0 to 45 g l reduction in no3 n removal initial 113 mg l with increase in nacl from 20 to 60 g l with acetate as carbon source is available in literature 34 anoxic biomass in the present study was exposed to more pernicious organic and inorganic pollutants along with high influent no3 n 1000 mg l and still showed more than 90 removal up to 35 g l of nacl generated gas volume released by a1 is summarized in tables 5a and 5b and constituent analysis is shown in fig 6b gas production was maximum in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in nacl volume of co2 and h2s were constant throughout and were not affected by the increase in salinity ch4 was never observed in any of the samples decrease in the reduction of no3 n to n2 was observed with increase in nacl as fraction of n2 decreased from 92 to 80 of the total gas generated nh4 n removal in a1 was quite low 3 5 irrespective of the nacl dose fig 6c complete oxidation of nh4 n was achieved up to nacl dose of 30 g l in a2 and higher nacl 35 45 g l resulted in decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency from 99 to 86 fig 6c activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria decreased with increase in salinity in a reported literature 35 influent no3 n and no2 n to a2 increased with increase in nacl as denitrification decreased in a1 no3 n and no2 n were formed from the oxidation of nh4 n fig 6d effluent no3 n increased and no2 n decreased in a2 tables 5a and 5b suggesting nitrification of the influent nh4 n and no2 n nitrification rate of nh4 n in a2 was calculated as follows 6 n o 3 n e f f n o 3 n i n f n o 2 n i n f n o 2 n e f f h r t where no3 n eff effluent nitrate mg l no3 n inf influent nitrate mg l no2 n inf influent nitrite n no2 n eff effluent nitrite n maximum nitrification rate of 138 7 g m3 d was observed in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in salt concentration complete conversion of nh4 n to no3 n was inhibited in the presence of salinity nitrification rates of 132 5 122 4 121 3 114 2 109 2 104 4 94 3 g m3 d was observed at nacl dose of 10 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 g l respectively decrease in nitrification beyond 40 g l of nacl dose was reported at influent nh4 n of 60 mg l 36 nitrifying action of the microorganisms was hampered at smaller nacl dose 30 g l due to higher nh4 n concentration and presence of toxic hydrocarbons similarly decrease in nitrification at nacl 24 1 g l has been reported 37 complete nh4 n oxidation was achieved after the removal of nacl dose and improvement in the nitrification rate 170 5 g m3 d was observed suggesting recovery of a2 after the removal of inhibiting salinity nacl 3 3 pure culture analysis with the identified species dominance of pseudomonas aeruginosa skm2013 15 and pseudomonas aeruginosa sc2013 27 in anoxic biomass has been described previously both were able to degrade phenol hydrocarbon s2 and no3 n with emulsified crude oil being used as complex hydrocarbon source high nacl had detrimental effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa skm2013 fig 7 a and effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa sc2013 fig 7b was marginal negative effect of increased salinity on denitrification efficiency of pseudomonas aeruginosa is previously being reported 32 details of the four dominant cultures in the aerobic biomass named lysinibacillus sp h200 150 stenotrophomonas sp lw 34 pseudomonas aeruginosa lzs8436 and pseudomonas aeruginosa isb4 can be obtained elsewhere 27 lysinibacillus sp h200 150 fig 7c stenotrophomonas sp lw 34 fig 7d and pseudomonas aeruginosa lzs8436 fig 7e could degrade both organics and nh4 n identification of stenotrophomonas sp during the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in saline medium has already came into picture recently 9 however pseudomonas aeruginosa isb4 fig 7f did not show any potential for nh4 n oxidation out of the four dominant aerobic cultures lysinibacillus sp h200 150 could effectively resist the effect of nacl up to 30 g l and slight decline in the removals of organics and nh4 n was observed fig 7c performance of stenotrophomonas sp lw 34 was drastically hampered beyond 30 g l of nacl fig 7d in case of pseudomonas aeruginosa lzs8436 fig 7e and pseudomonas aeruginosa isb4 fig 7f removals of pollutants continued to decrease with increase in nacl nh4 n oxidation by lysinibacillus sp 38 stenotrophomonas sp 39 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 39 in aerobic condition have been reported the present study is the first of its kind to report the effect of high salinity on the mentioned cultures 4 conclusions removal efficiency of organics nitrate n and heterotrophic activity of anoxic biomass deteriorated with increase in salinity sulfide removal was never hampered however increase in nacl caused decline in sulfide to sulfate conversion along with chemolithotrophic activity of anoxic biomass aerobic biomass was more tolerant to high salinity and removals of both organics and ammonia n started to decrease at nacl 30 g l high salinity caused toxic effect on the anoxic biomass and triggered sloughing and decrease in srt was resulted sloughing of the aerobic biomass was only observed beyond 30 g l of nacl complete recovery of biomass distribution activity and performance of both anoxic and aerobic reactors was achieved after the withdrawal of nacl pseudomonas aeruginosa sc2013 and lysinibacillus sp h200 150 could tolerate high salinity in anoxic and aerobic biomass respectively declaration the authors are

of chemicals with high salinity both organics and inorganics is formed during the crude oil extraction process due to leaching of various salts from aquifer to extracted oil 1 saline water or seawater is used to maintain oil reservoir pressure in the aquifer zone which subsequently generates wastewater with high organics and total dissolved solids tds during product finishing operations 2 surfactants and polymers which contain ammonia n nh4 n are used for the better recovery of oil from reservoirs 3 dilute alkali solution is used for the scrapping of h2s inside petroleum refineries this mixture of alkali and h2s is commonly known as spent caustic during the refining exercise it becomes part of the refinery effluent and increases its salinity 4 hence processed water from petroleum refineries becomes a chemical soup of emulsified hydrocarbons sulfide s2 and nh4 n this concoction can be characterized by high conductivity ph salinity and tds in which the salt concentration can rise up to 300 g l 5 6 deterioration to the growth of microbial biomass is a possibility while exposed to high saline condition 7 however biotransformation being a cheap option is mostly used for the remediation of industrial wastewater assimilation of pollutants in saline refinery wastewater by aerobic 8 11 and anaerobic anoxic 12 13 processes have been reported to meet possible discharge standards above mentioned literatures never considered s2 and nh4 n as pollutants which are integral part of refinery effluents s2 oxidation is possible in closed anaerobic anoxic systems to avoid volatilization and nh4 n oxidation requires aerobic environment hence treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater by anoxic aerobic series reactors can be fruitful for the removals of hydrocarbons s2 and nh4 n 14 simultaneous removals of hydrocarbons s2 and nh4 n by anoxic aerobic sequential series reactors is reported recently where s2 was removed in anoxic reactor and nh4 n was removed in aerobic reactor with residual organics 15 combined treatment of hydrocarbons and nh4 n in anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactors operated in series are reported 16 21 however studies involving the effect of salinity on the performance of bioreactors operated in series are not available the motivation of this study came from the absence of reported literatures involving the effect of salinity on the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater in addition there is lack of study about the operation of series reactors in saline condition while treating petroleum refinery wastewater successful operation of anoxic aerobic series bioreactors for the assimilation of petroleum refinery wastewater has been reported 15 22 however the behaviour of the system exposed to high saline condition has not been reported yet for petroleum refinery wastewater extensive report on the effect of high salinity on the individual species of microorganisms is yet to be studied for petroleum refinery wastewater in the present study effect of infeed salinity nacl concentration on the performance of anoxic aerobic sequential moving bed reactors were examined during the assimilation of petroleum refinery wastewater in addition effects of increased salt concentrations on the available biomass biomass activity and effects on the dominant microbial community were analyzed 2 materials

5 2 quantification of reactor biomass biomass in the reactors both a1 and a2 were determined as volatile solids vs as both attached and suspended form to determine the vs in attached form in a1 one disc each was collected from top middle and bottom of the disc bed then standard ignition method 24 was followed for the determination of vs vs due to biomass was obtained by subtracting virgin disc weight from the total vs and averaged the average vs in one disc multiplied by the number of discs gave the total attached vs due to biomass in a1 to determine the attached volatile solids in a2 six random puf cubes were collected then standard ignition method 24 was followed attached vs due to biomass was obtained by subtracting the weight of virgin cube from the total vs and averaged attached volatile solids available in a2 was obtained by multiplying the average vs in one cube with the total number of cubes in the reactor to determine the suspended vs in a1 50 ml mixed liquor was

ca using a modified method 25 in three cycles ha was separately done for biomass of a1 and a2 and ca was done with a1 biomass only one gram biomass was collected for the determination of biomass activity the collected one gram biomass was in the same attached to suspended biomass ratio as available inside the reactors auxiliary nutrients such as yeast extract phosphate buffer and trace metals were not used to prevent biomass growth aspirator bottle 1 l having provision for gas and sample collection was used for ha analysis of anoxic biomass magnetic stirrer tarsons was used for mixing and sample was collected from the bottom port with a syringe at predetermined time intervals influent organics fraction of cod was calculated by correcting the interference due to s2 s2o3 2 and no2

of the crude oil was done by acid digestion method mentioned in mallick and chakraborty 2019a the properties of the crude oil is summarized in table 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect on reactor biomass attached biomass was maximum in a1 in the absence of nacl fig 2 a decrease in attached biomass and increase in suspended biomass were observed with increase in nacl dose suggesting sloughing of the anoxic biomass at high salinity presence of salts and increase in the ionic strength of water inhibited the catabolic and anabolic activity of the microbial community 28 and mineralization of feed source was hampered this led to endogenous respiration as well as rupture of cell biomass and resulted into sloughing srt of a1 decreased due to increased sloughing from discs and washing out of biomass with increase in salinity fig 2b anoxic biomass received the initial toxic load with high salinity and pollutants concentrations however aerobic biomass received comparatively lesser concentrations hence nacl had more profound effect on the anoxic biomass as change in the distribution of aerobic biomass was only observed beyond nacl concentration of 30 g l fig 2c whereas anoxic biomass was effected at three times lesser dose of nacl there was a decrease of 8 in the total anoxic biomass and 2 in the total aerobic biomass with increase in nacl from 0 g l to 45 g l srt of a2 was not affected up to 30 g l of nacl and decreased with further increase in nacl fig 2d total biomass of both a1 and a2 increased when nacl was reduced to 0 g l during recovery distribution of attached and suspended biomass in the total biomass of both a1 and a2 was observed to be similar as it was before the introduction of nacl this suggests full recovery of the reactor biomass after the withdrawal of nacl load 3 2 performance analysis of reactors 3 2 1 organics removal effluent phenol fig 3 a th fig 3b total cod codt fig 3c and organic cod codo fig 3d from a1 increased with increase in nacl corresponding decrease in removal efficiencies from 38 to 14 phenol 45 to 23 th 64 to 49 codt and 41 to 18 codo at 60 h hrt was observed decrease in srt had negative effect on the efficiency of a1 decrease in the removals of hydrocarbons beyond 10 g l of nacl 29 and decrease in cod removal at nacl dose of 8 g l 7 in anoxic condition has been previously reported similarly decrease in cod removal in a1 started with the introduction of 10 g l of nacl in the present study however negative effect of nacl up to 20 g l during removal of catechol by denitrification was reported 30 in the present study inhibition on organics degradation occurred at lower nacl dose due to the presence of much toxic compounds and high alkaline ph effluent of a1 was treated in a2 and effect of influent nacl on a2 was never observed up to 30 g l as complete removals of phenol fig 3a th fig 3b and codo fig 3d was observed at 20 h hrt with a total hrt of 80 h beyond nacl dose of 30 g l performance of a2 started to decline and overall efficiency of the a1 a2 system decreased aerobic degradation of poly aromatic hydrocarbons influent th 1419 mg l was hampered beyond nacl dose of 40 g l in a reported study 9 in the present study 30 g l of nacl caused problems for the aerobic biomass possibly due to the presence of hydrocarbons with higher density and viscosity and high ph increase in the final effluent of codt from the a1 a2 system was observed with increase in nacl fig 3c presence of more than 2 g l of cl could cause interference in the cod determination 24 hence overall cod removal decreased efficiency of both a1 and a2 for the removal of organics increased during the recovery phase nacl 0 g l and complete recovery of the reactors was achieved heterotrophic activity ha was analysed for both anoxic and aerobic biomass at every phase of nacl dose variation and activity cycles are illustrated in supplementary fig s1a and b ha of anoxic biomass was maximum in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in nacl fig 4 a ha of aerobic biomass was stable up to 30 g l nacl and decreased at higher concentrations fig 4b decrease in activity of both anoxic and aerobic biomass was reflected in the reactor efficiency as both srt and organics removal decreased at higher influent nacl concentrations hence ha of the reactor biomass had direct correlation with the organics degradation efficiency ha of both anoxic and aerobic biomass increased during the recovery period and were similar as they were before the introduction of nacl 3 2 2 sulfide removal influent and effluent concentrations of s2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 are illustrated in fig 5 and average concentrations are summarized in tables 5a and 5b effect of nacl dose and decrease in a1 reactor srt did not affect removal of s2 and complete removal of s2 occurred in a1 at 60 h hrt fig 5a effluent so4 2 decreased whereas s2o3 2 increased with increase in salinity levels in a1 fig 5a s2 to so4 2 conversion hampered with increase in nacl concentration and 38 of the removed s2 was converted to so4 2 at 45 g l of nacl dose partial degradation of s2 was supported by the increase in salinity as s2o3 2 conversion increased from 3 to 8 of the removed s2 with increase in nacl dose of 0 g l to 45 g l remaining of the removed s2 could attribute to the production of bio sulfur s calculated by mass balance of sulfur compounds 15 which increased form 49 54 with increase in nacl from 0 g l to 45 g l decrease in so4 2 and increase in s during oxidation of s2 influent 200 mg l in the presence of acetate in anoxic conditions with increase in nacl 0 70 g l has been reported 31 at 35 g l of nacl with 95 s2 removal efficiency 55 of the feed s2 was converted to s 31 however in the present study with feed s2 of 750 mg l 99 s2 removal was achieved with 52 converted to s both the results supported that higher salinity favored incomplete oxidation of s2 to s residual s2o3 2 was oxidized to so4 2 in a2 and effect of nacl was not observed fig 5b chemolithotrophic activity ca cycles are summarized in supplementary fig s2 ca was maximum in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in nacl fig 4c decrease in ca was the potential reason for the decrease in the complete oxidation of s2 to so4 2 and increase in the intermediate s0 and s2o3 2 when nacl dose was reduced to 0 g l in the recovery phase ca of anoxic biomass increased and recovered to its original state fig 4c 3 2 3 nitrogen removal complete removal of no3 n occurred in the absence of nacl fig 6 a decrease in the removals of phenol and th led to lesser utilization of the electron acceptor reduction of no3 n was hampered and partial degradation was enhanced as no2 n accumulation increased more than 1 5 times with increase in nacl from 0 to 45 g l in a1 tables 5a and 5b denitrification was calculated as per the following 5 d e n i t r i f i c a t i o n i n f n o 3 e f f n o 3 e f f n o 2 i n f n o 3 100 where inf no3 influent nitrate n mg l eff no3 effluent nitrate n mg l eff no2 effluent nitrite n mg l diversity of microbial community decreases in the presence of salinity and nitrite reductase gene was affected at high salt concentration 32 decrease in denitrifying community with increase in salinity during degradation of aromatic hydrocarbon has been reported 33 hence there was accumulation of no2 n in a1 with increase in nacl and denitrification efficiency decreased from 81 to 55 with increase in nacl from 0 to 45 g l reduction in no3 n removal initial 113 mg l with increase in nacl from 20 to 60 g l with acetate as carbon source is available in literature 34 anoxic biomass in the present study was exposed to more pernicious organic and inorganic pollutants along with high influent no3 n 1000 mg l and still showed more than 90 removal up to 35 g l of nacl generated gas volume released by a1 is summarized in tables 5a and 5b and constituent analysis is shown in fig 6b gas production was maximum in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in nacl volume of co2 and h2s were constant throughout and were not affected by the increase in salinity ch4 was never observed in any of the samples decrease in the reduction of no3 n to n2 was observed with increase in nacl as fraction of n2 decreased from 92 to 80 of the total gas generated nh4 n removal in a1 was quite low 3 5 irrespective of the nacl dose fig 6c complete oxidation of nh4 n was achieved up to nacl dose of 30 g l in a2 and higher nacl 35 45 g l resulted in decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency from 99 to 86 fig 6c activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria decreased with increase in salinity in a reported literature 35 influent no3 n and no2 n to a2 increased with increase in nacl as denitrification decreased in a1 no3 n and no2 n were formed from the oxidation of nh4 n fig 6d effluent no3 n increased and no2 n decreased in a2 tables 5a and 5b suggesting nitrification of the influent nh4 n and no2 n nitrification rate of nh4 n in a2 was calculated as follows 6 n o 3 n e f f n o 3 n i n f n o 2 n i n f n o 2 n e f f h r t where no3 n eff effluent nitrate mg l no3 n inf influent nitrate mg l no2 n inf influent nitrite n no2 n eff effluent nitrite n maximum nitrification rate of 138 7 g m3 d was observed in the absence of nacl and decreased with increase in salt concentration complete conversion of nh4 n to no3 n was inhibited in the presence of salinity nitrification rates of 132 5 122 4 121 3 114 2 109 2 104 4 94 3 g m3 d was observed at nacl dose of 10 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 g l respectively decrease in nitrification beyond 40 g l of nacl dose was reported at influent nh4 n of 60 mg l 36 nitrifying action of the microorganisms was hampered at smaller nacl dose 30 g l due to higher nh4 n concentration and presence of toxic hydrocarbons similarly decrease in nitrification at nacl 24 1 g l has been reported 37 complete nh4 n oxidation was achieved after the removal of nacl dose and improvement in the nitrification rate 170 5 g m3 d was observed suggesting recovery of a2 after the removal of inhibiting salinity nacl 3 3 pure culture analysis with the identified species dominance of pseudomonas aeruginosa skm2013 15 and pseudomonas aeruginosa sc2013 27 in anoxic biomass has been described previously both were able to degrade phenol hydrocarbon s2 and no3 n with emulsified crude oil being used as complex hydrocarbon source high nacl had detrimental effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa skm2013 fig 7 a and effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa sc2013 fig 7b was marginal negative effect of increased salinity on denitrification efficiency of pseudomonas aeruginosa is previously being reported 32 details of the four dominant cultures in the aerobic biomass named lysinibacillus sp h200 150 stenotrophomonas sp lw 34 pseudomonas aeruginosa lzs8436 and pseudomonas aeruginosa isb4 can be obtained elsewhere 27 lysinibacillus sp h200 150 fig 7c stenotrophomonas sp lw 34 fig 7d and pseudomonas aeruginosa lzs8436 fig 7e could degrade both organics and nh4 n identification of stenotrophomonas sp during the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in saline medium has already came into picture recently 9 however pseudomonas aeruginosa isb4 fig 7f did not show any potential for nh4 n oxidation out of the four dominant aerobic cultures lysinibacillus sp h200 150 could effectively resist the effect of nacl up to 30 g l and slight decline in the removals of organics and nh4 n was observed fig 7c performance of stenotrophomonas sp lw 34 was drastically hampered beyond 30 g l of nacl fig 7d in case of pseudomonas aeruginosa lzs8436 fig 7e and pseudomonas aeruginosa isb4 fig 7f removals of pollutants continued to decrease with increase in nacl nh4 n oxidation by lysinibacillus sp 38 stenotrophomonas sp 39 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 39 in aerobic condition have been reported the present study is the first of its kind to report the effect of high salinity on the mentioned cultures 4 conclusions removal efficiency of organics nitrate n and heterotrophic activity of anoxic biomass deteriorated with increase in salinity sulfide removal was never hampered however increase in nacl caused decline in sulfide to sulfate conversion along with chemolithotrophic activity of anoxic biomass aerobic biomass was more tolerant to high salinity and removals of both organics and ammonia n started to decrease at nacl 30 g l high salinity caused toxic effect on the anoxic biomass and triggered sloughing and decrease in srt was resulted sloughing of the aerobic biomass was only observed beyond 30 g l of nacl complete recovery of biomass distribution activity and performance of both anoxic and aerobic reactors was achieved after the withdrawal of nacl pseudomonas aeruginosa sc2013 and lysinibacillus sp h200 150 could tolerate high salinity in anoxic and aerobic biomass respectively declaration the authors are
