17210,in this study a new photo irradiated reductive dechlorination pathway and the underlying transformation mechanism are described for poly vinyl chloride microplastics pvc mps pvc mps underwent photo reductive dechlorination process with the release of chloride ions this reaction could be facilitated in the presence of indole 3 acetic acid iaa and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab under neutral ph and simulated sunlight irradiation conditions electrostatic interaction between iaa and ctab produced neutral iaa ctab complex which might account for the enhanced adsorption of iaa on pvc powders upon photo irradiation the adsorbed iaa was excited to generate hydrated electrons eaq which could pass through a shorter distance to pvc mp surface than that derived from homogeneous iaa molecules in aqueous solution transient spectra of laser flash photolysis provided direct evidence for the generation of eaq which supported the proposed dechlorination mechanism based on the results of attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir and raman spectra c cl bond cleavage and polyene formation were involved in the structural transformation of pvc mps due to the hydrophobic effects and π π interactions between aromatic rings and polyene structures in pvc mp surface the pvc mp powders irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab showed an enhanced sorption for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic aromatic chemicals graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords poly vinyl chloride microplastics indole 3 acetic acid hydrated electrons

which has raised concerns from environmental researchers and even the public due to their ingestion and subsequent impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms cole and galloway 2015 cole et al 2015 huerta lwanga et al 2016 lu et al 2016 watts et al 2014 wright et al 2013 the major sources of mps include discharge of small plastic particles as abrasive scrubbers in cleansers and fragmentation of larger plastics via photolytic mechanical thermal hydrolytic and biological degradation in the environments andrady 2011 browne et al 2007 fendall and sewell 2009 zitko and hanlon 1991 in the past decade the marine environment is reported to be the major sink of mps browne et al 2011 cole et al 2011 however various mps e g polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene have been detected in wastewater treatment plants mahon et al 2016 in many freshwater areas castañeda et al 2014 eriksen et al 2013 mccormick et al 2014 and even in polar regions lusher et al 2014 due to the excellent chemical and physical properties poly vinyl chloride pvc has been widely applied in the synthesis of industrial and domestic products and china has exceeded usa to be the largest producer as indicated in the report of 2013 worldwide pvc production however the final destination of pvc plastics is to be in the waste after their usage or due to insufficient quality during production process actually the presence of macro and micro sized debris of pvc has been reported in various environmental matrices in previous researches including sediments and sandy beaches along estuarine shorelines browne et al 2010 it was found that pvc microplastic pvc mp was one of the most common microscopic plastic debris in sandy beaches which comprised 25 of total mps in estuaries browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 moreover as indicated by the results of pvc mp toxicity assessments intestinal damage suppressed feeding activity and increased lethality were observed for zebrafish danio rerio lugworm arenicola marina and nematode caenorhabditis elegans respectively lei et al 2018 it was well known that several reductive dechlorination reactions widely happen in the environments such as anaerobic reduction processes induced by microbes and reductive minerals bunge et al 2003 lee and batchelor 2002 moreover as the most active reducing species the hydrated electron eaq could be generated from indole or its derivatives in aqueous solution under ultraviolet light irradiation hart and boag 1962 verlet et al 2005 various organic contaminants have been reported to be reduced by eaq e g nitro aromatic and perfluorinated compounds qu et al 2010 song et al 2013 tian et al 2016 tian et al 2015 dehydrochlorination characterized by the formation of polyene sequences is also one of the most common transformation routes for pvc plastics under natural weathering conditions jakubowicz 2001 therefore pvc mps distributed in the environments may undergo natural dechlorination reaction with environmental reducing species however due to the hydrophobic surfaces of pvc mps and short lifetime of polar eaq the reduction reaction between pvc mps and eaq would be inhibited under environmentally relevant conditions therefore a proper medium is needed to improve the reductive performance of eaq for pvc mp dechlorination as commonly used surface active compounds the cationic surfactants have been extensively utilized in industrial and commercial products agrawal et al 2004 mckane and kandel 1996 the widespread application of cationic surfactants implies that these compounds are expected to be present in various environmental matrices including water soil and sediment agrawal et al 2004 shrivas and wu 2007 it was reported by shrivas and wu 2007 that the concentration of a commonly used cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab could reach 102 μg l 1 in river water and municipal wastewater recently many researches have reported the interfacial electron transfer assisted by surfactants tunuli and fendler 1981 found that surfactant vesicles exhibited adverse impacts on photosensitized electron transfer and charge separation additionally chen et al 2020 reported that ctab could bridge the gap between indole 3 acetic acid iaa and perfluorooctanoic acid by reversing the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion thus enhancing the defluorination efficiency by eaq derived from iaa therefore it is expected that the interaction between indoles and ctab may promote the transformation of pvc mps by eaq in this study iaa was selected as the model indole derivative due to its prior eaq yield and widespread existence in the environments chen and kenny 2007 miura et al 2011 zhang et al 1999 tian and gu 2018 the objective of this study was i to investigate the photo transformation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa and ctab ii to ascertain the roles of eaq in pvc mp transformation with multiple techniques iii to explore the enhanced dechlorination mechanism of pvc mps by eaq derived from iaa coexisting with ctab iv to gain insights into the adsorption capacity of photo aged pvc mps for polar and nonpolar aromatic compounds our experimental results provide the first evidence for the reductive dechlorination of pvc mps by photo generated eaq which would improve the understanding of the transformation and potential risks of mps in aquatic environments and even shed light on the future treatment of mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals guaranteed reagent pvc pellets with diameters of 300 nm were

adjusted to ph 7 by adding 0 1 m naoh and hcl solutions subsequently the iaa ctab mixture with iaa ctab molar ratio of 10 1 was synthesized by mixing 2000 μm iaa and 200 μm ctab stock solutions with equal volume this molar ratio was optimized based on the results of preliminary experiments as shown in fig s1 comparing to the dechlorination reaction at iaa ctab ratio of 10 1 much weaker enhancement in pvc mp dechlorination was obtained when the concentrations of ctab increased or decreased notably quartz vessels were utilized in all the experiments to avoid ion leaching resulting from reagent preparation and storage in borosilicate glass 2 3 photo transformation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa ctab complexes under different oxygen conditions the photo transformation

mp suspensions at predetermined time interval samples were sacrificed and the released cl concentrations during the photoreaction were measured using an ion chromatography dionex co usa for comparison similar treatments were conducted for pvc mps only pvc mps in the presence of iaa termed as pvc iaa and pvc mps in the presence of ctab termed as pvc ctab respectively in order to confirm the contribution of eaq on the transformation of pvc mps similar experiments were also conducted for reaction solutions fully deoxygenated with n2o for 60 min notably the parafilms were used to obtain isolation of reaction solutions from air for all samples during the photo irradiation period 2 4 analysis of transient species by laser flash photolysis and electron paramagnetic resonance epr the laser flash system equipped with a nd yag laser quanta ray lab 150 10 spectra physics operated at 266 nm was used to determine the generated transient species upon photo irradiation at room temperature the concentrations of iaa and ctab were set as 100 µm and 10 µm respectively the experiments were conducted according to the method reported by tian et al 2015 briefly a spectrophotometrical method was used to monitor transient reactive species the emission light from a 150 w xenon arc lamp xbo 150 w cr ofr osram was focused to pass through a 1 1 cm quartz cell subsequently entering the programmable f 3 4 grating monochromator on the other hand the analytical light also passed through the quartz cell in a perpendicular direction to the laser beam eaq were generated by photolysis of iaa with laser energy of 14 0 mj per pulse in order to confirm the contribution from eaq transient spectra were recorded for n2 and n2o saturated sample solutions respectively the bruker epr spectrometer x2 band a300 6 1 was employed to collect the epr spectra of iaa and iaa ctab purged with n2 or n2o at room temperature a 100 w mercury lamp ush 102d ushio japan was utilized as the irradiation light source dmpo was served as the probe molecule to capture reactive species generated during the radiation period the initial concentrations of dmpo iaa and

respectively 2 5 characterization of pristine and aged pvc mps the structural changes of pvc mps after 96 h photo irradiation were investigated by a microscope of attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy micro atr ftir bruker hyperion 2000 ettlingen germany with ir spectra range of 600 2000 cm 1 and the ft iris fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy images were recorded for newly occurring functional groups after photo irradiation for all samples the analyzed surface with area of 100 μm 75 μm was referred to a grid of 10 points in x and y axis and each point corresponded to an ir spectrum the caf2 window was used as the support for pvc pellets and its ir spectrum was collected to correct the signal from background to trace the whole reaction process on the pvc mp surface time resolved raman spectra tr raman were recorded using a jobin yvon spectrometer xplora plus horiba scientific equipped with a 514 nm laser bonding information of pvc mp surfaces was analyzed using a labspec6 spectroscopy suite software an olympus bx41 microscope equipped with two objectives i e 10 olympus mplann and 50 olympus lmplanfl was utilized to focus the laser beam on and to collect the raman scattered light from the pvc mp particles 2 6 theoretical calculation gaussian 09w program frisch et al 2009 with dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to investigate structures of iaa ctab and pvc to simplify the calculation six monomers of pvc were utilized for gaussian simulation wang et al 2020 the 6 311g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of iaa ctab and pvc i e c h n o and cl moreover on the basis of the optimized geometries the bonding lengths and the frontier molecular orbitals i e homo the highest occupied molecular orbital and lumo the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were calculated to investigate the underlying degradation mechanism for pvc mp dechlorination 2 7 sorption of phenanthrene and 1 naphthol to pvc mps the adsorption capacities of pristine and photo irradiated pvc mps were assessed according to the method reported by wang et al 2015 the pvc mps after photo reaction in the absence or presence of iaa ctab were collected and rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water for at least three times to remove ctab and iaa residues prior to the adsorption isotherm experiments phenanthrene and 1 naphthol were selected as the representative nonpolar and polar model contaminants respectively for each experiment 3 0 mg light treated pvc mps were added into a 50 ml glass centrifuge tube containing 30 0 ml phenanthrene or 1 naphthol solution with the initial concentrations in the range of 0 5 50 0 µg l 1 the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 using 1 mm phosphate buffer the centrifuge tubes were capped and shaken on a rotary shaker 200 rpm is rdv1 crystal usa at 25 c for 24 h in the dark and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 60 min similar experiments were also conducted for pristine pvc mp powders as control no significant loss during the adsorption process was observed as indicated by 98 9 recovery the concentrations of phenanthrene and 1 naphthol were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc water alliance 2695 milford ma equipped with a waters 2475 fluorescence detector the excitation and emission wavelengths were 250 and 364 nm and an agilent c18 reverse phase column 5 µm 4 6 150 mm acetonitrile water 80 20 v v was served as the mobile phase and the flow rate was set as 1 ml min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo transformation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa ctab under varied oxygen conditions as shown in fig 1 a under anaerobic condition do concentration 0 1 µm the released cl concentration of pvc mps after 96 h light irradiation was 10 73 µm 0 67 dechlorination ratio and the presence of ctab enhanced this value to 16 06 µm 1 00 dechlorination ratio whereas iaa exhibited significant promotion for pvc mp dechlorination in the first 24 h but obvious inhibition occurred in the following reaction period with the 96 h dechlorination ratio of 0 52 interestingly the presence of iaa ctab increased dechlorination ratio of pvc mp particles up to 2 06 therefore the joint action of iaa and ctab could increase the chloride release by 3 1 4 0 and 2 1 times compared with pvc mps only pvc iaa and pvc ctab respectively this suggested that a synergistic effect between iaa and ctab existed in the light irradiated transformation process of pvc mps the addition of ctab also increased the concentration of released chloride ions for pvc ctab system by comparison with pvc and pvc iaa systems which could be attributed to the enhanced dispersion and disaggregation by this cationic surface active agent eitzen et al 2018 vaisman et al 2006 vroom et al 2017 the effect of do on pvc mp photo transformation was investigated by changing the initial do concentrations as show in fig 1 do showed negligible effect on the 96 h dechlorination in pvc mps only pvc iaa and pvc ctab systems however for pvc iaa ctab system the cl release was significantly inhibited with the increasing do concentrations the determined concentrations of released cl in pvc iaa ctab system were 33 0 21 7 16 5 and 12 5 µm for do dosages of 0 1 10 9 85 7 and 252 3 µm respectively fig 1 this could be explained by the fast reaction of eaq with o2 thus quenching the reductive dechlorination induced by eaq tian et al 2016 n2o has been confirmed to be an effective quencher for eaq with the production of n2 hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radical oh okazaki and takeshita 2018 zhang et al 2018 thus reaction solutions were purged with n2o gas to eliminate the impacts of eaq as shown in fig s2 a significant decrease in dechlorination was observed for pvc iaa and pvc iaa ctab systems purged with n2o while no effects were obtained for pvc and pvc ctab groups the efficient scavenge by n2o further confirmed the major contribution of eaq derived from iaa photolysis based on our results ctab played an important role in the photo dechlorination process of pvc mps it was proposed that the formation of iaa ctab complex promoted the sorption of iaa on the surface of pvc powders thus shortening the transfer distance of eaq from iaa to pvc mp surfaces this hypothesis was further confirmed by adsorption kinetics of iaa to pvc mps in the presence or absence of ctab as illustrated in fig 2 the addition of ctab significantly enhanced the adsorption rate and equilibrium adsorption capacity of iaa on pvc mp powders at room temperature in the first 1 h the adsorption amount of iaa q was 6 0 and 94 8 µmol g 1 for pvc iaa and pvc iaa ctab systems respectively indicating that ctab was able enhance the adsorption rate this dramatic increase in adsorption rate could be attributed to the formation of more hydrophobic neutral complex of iaa ctab by comparison with iaa anion iaa is a weak acid with the dissociation constant pk a of 4 60 4 75 raven 1975 thus the ionized iaa would be the major existing species under the experimental conditions ph 7 therefore the negatively charged iaa would interact with the cationic surfactant ctab via electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic effect which has been reported in our previous studies chen et al 2020 given the electronegative property of pvc mp surfaces due to the presence of chlorine element the electrostatic repulsion inevitably inhibited the sorption of ionized iaa on pvc mps the adsorption equilibrium could be obtained within 24 h and the maximum adsorption amount was 232 9 µmol g 1 for pvc iaa ctab system which was 2 2 times greater than that of the system without ctab the significant increase in iaa adsorption could be attributed to the ctab induced reversion of the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged iaa and electronegative pvc mps once iaa was adsorbed the generated eaq derived from iaa photolysis could reach pvc mp surface via a shorter transfer distance comparing with homogenous iaa in aqueous solution thus achieving higher reductive dechlorination efficiency 3 2 laser flash photolysis epr micro atr ftir and raman analysis to further explore the underlying reaction mechanism laser flash photolysis micro atr ftir and raman measurements were conducted fig 3 a showed the absorption spectra of the transient intermediates in the range of 450 750 nm upon photolysis of iaa 100 µm and iaa ctab 100 µm 10 µm in n2 and n2o purged solutions the broad and asymmetric optical absorption peak around 690 nm could be assigned to eaq which is consistent with the theoretical and experimental results reported by previous researchers abramczyk and kroh 1991 hart and boag 1962 tian and gu 2018 this characteristic absorption band was efficiently scavenged by n2o further confirming the contribution from eaq in addition the production and decay of eaq was observed for iaa and iaa ctab aqueous solutions saturated with n2 fig 3b but not for n2 purged ultrapure water and ctab solution indicating that the formation of eaq was derived from iaa photolysis based on the determined absorbance and published extinction coefficient at 690 nm 20 560 m 1 cm 1 sauer et al 2004 the yield of eaq were calculated to be 4 23 10 6 m and 3 34 10 6 m for iaa and iaa ctab solutions respectively the decay of eaq occurred when adding ctab indicating that the presence of ctab was able to inhibit the production of eaq this phenomenon could be attributed to the recombination of eaq with the positively charged nitrogen atom of quaternary ammonia chen et al 2020 the generation of eaq was further confirmed by the results of epr as shown in fig 3c the signal of eaq as indicated by dmpo h was observed for both n2 purged iaa and iaa ctab which is consistent with the results of laser transient spectra after purging with n2o the characteristic peaks of eaq vanished while the signals of hydroxyl radicals were strengthened which could be attributed to the production of oh via the reaction between eaq and n2o okazaki and takeshita 2018 zhang et al 2018 therefore according to our experimental results ctab was able to enhance the transformation of pvc mps by promoting the eaq induced dechlorination process self quenching reactions also occurred to diminish the eaq to get further insights into the underlying transformation mechanism the micro atr ftir technique was utilized to monitor the photo induced alteration of pvc mps the simulated solar irradiation could achieve release of chloride ions thus leading to the changes in surface functional groups of pvc mps wang et al 2020 the peaks at 617 and 695 cm 1 were assigned to c cl stretching in pvc syndiotactic and isotactic sequences respectively fig 4 a d quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 the rocking and deformation modes of ch2 occurred at 836 and 1334 cm 1 fig 4a d quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 the peaks at 962 1254 and 1428 cm 1 were referred to trans ch wagging ch rocking and ch deformation respectively fig 4a d quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 comparing with the ftir spectrum of original pvc mp sample fig s3 a new band at 1594 cm 1 was observed and assigned to c c stretching rajendran and uma 2001 the formation of c c double bond could be attributed to the photo irradiated dechlorination process moreover the enhanced dechlorination of pvc mps treated with iaa ctab was also confirmed by the stronger relative peak intensity of c c stretching mode furthermore ft iris images fig 4e h were collected for visualization of the relative peak intensity based on the absorbance of c c double bond around 1600 cm 1 with pixels ranging in color from blue to light purple absorbance 2 12 compared to the controls before light irradiation fig s4a d the surfaces of all photo irradiated pvc mps exhibited various distribution of color ranging from light blue to light purple the greatest absorbance as indicated by color of light green light blue light red and light purple were observed for samples treated with simulated solar irradiation in the presence of pvc pvc iaa pvc ctab and pvc iaa ctab respectively which is consistent with the relative peak intensity of c c double bond in ftir spectra the occurrence of c c double bond was further confirmed by raman analysis as illustrated in fig 5 c cl stretching c c bending and c h bending occurred at 635 697 1113 and 1436 cm 1 respectively ellahi et al 1995 prokhorov et al 2016 interestingly a new peak around 1510 cm 1 was observed and strengthened with increasing irradiation time and the new peak referred to the conjugated c c stretching mode ellahi et al 1995 in order to obtain the accurate length of conjugated polyene sequence n baruya et al 1983 established a reliable relationship between the c c stretching frequency v 2 and n eq 1 based on the raman spectra v 2 1515 1515 1509 and 1506 cm 1 so the conjugated polyene sequence length was calculated to be n 13 13 14 and 15 for pvc mps irradiated for 12 24 48 and 96 h respectively therefore the photo transformation of pvc mps assisted by iaa ctab complexes could promote the generation of polyene structures with sequence length ranging from 13 to 15 1 v 2 1461 151 24 e 0 07808 n 3 3 elucidation of photo transformation mechanism pvc mps underwent dechlorination process in the absence or presence of iaa ctab complexes and a possible dechlorination mechanism was proposed based on previous studies and theoretical calculations it is generally accepted that the photochemical degradation of pvc proceeds primarily via two different mechanisms ionic and radical type routes rånby et al 1978 in both degradation pathways alkene or polyene linkages were produced and dehyrochlorination process happened when exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet radiation jakubowicz 2001 jian et al 1991 matuana et al 2001 it has been reported that random dehydrochlorination of the pvc occurred at the beginning of polymer decomposition which generated polyene sequences with the maximum lengths of 10 16 units in further steps rånby et al 1978 as shown in the fig s5a the alteration of pvc mps by simulated solar irradiation was initiated by the cleavage of c cl bond with the formation of carbocation r1 and chloride ions r1 underwent fast dehydrogenation producing alkene containing p1 due to the formation of c c double bond the c cl bond adjacent to c c was lengthened from 1 809 å r1 to 1 856 å p1 and 1 865 å p2 based on the dft optimized results fig s5b since a negative relationship existed between bond energy and bond length the longer c cl bond in p1 and p2 was susceptible to cleavage moreover the dechlorination route was also supported by the results of homo and lumo orbitals fig s5c and d the enhanced photo irradiated dechlorination of pvc mps by eaq derived from iaa ctab complexes were also investigated as shown in fig s6a it was proposed that eaq would attack c cl bond of pvc mps first generating a radical r2 and cl the produced r2 underwent electron spin resonance and abstracted hydrogen atom from adjacent ch2 forming a new radical r3 comparing with that of r2 the length of c cl bond adjacent to radical site in r3 increased by 0 092 å fig s6b the extended c cl bond was more facile to be attacked by eaq with the generation of p3 containing c c double bond the calculated frontier molecular orbitals were visually illustrated for the dechlorination reaction spot by eaq fig s6c and d 3 4 sorption of phenanthrene and 1 naphthol onto pristine and photo altered pvc mps considering both ftir and raman results of light treated pvc mps photo induced chlorine elimination and c c formation would inevitably change the physiochemical properties of pvc mp surfaces therefore the adsorption of organic contaminants was evaluated for pristine and photo irradiated pvc mp powders phenanthrene and 1 naphthol were selected as the representative nonpolar and polar aromatic pollutants as shown in fig 6 a the sorption of phenanthrene on pvc mps followed the langmuir isotherm model with the maximum sorption q max of 54 02 51 76 53 18 and 70 75 µg g 1 for photo altered pvc mps and pvc mps irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab and iaa ctab respectively table s1 by comparison with the sorption capacity on pristine pvc mps q max 49 43 µg g 1 significant enhancement in the sorption of nonpolar phenanthrene was obtained for pvc mps suffering from light irradiation especially for those irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab figs 6a and s6a the enhancement in phenanthrene adsorption could be attributed to hydrophobic effects and π π interactions interestingly comparing with virgin mps fig s7b photo altered pvc mp particles also exhibited an obvious enhancement in the sorption of 1 naphthol fig 6b the 1 naphthol adsorption on pvc mps can be fitted with henry isotherm model with the respective adsorption coefficients k d of 0 14 0 15 0 16 0 24 and 0 36 l g 1 for pristine pvc pvc pvc iaa pvc ctab and pvc iaa ctab table s2 the enhanced adsorption might be attributed to π π interactions between benzene ring in 1 naphnol and polyene structure in the skeleton of photo altered pvc mps therefore photo induced dechlorination and generated polyene structures could promote the adsorption of both hydrophobic nonpolar and polar aromatic chemicals it has been reported that one potential hazard of microplastics is to be ingested by wildlife which might block the wildlife s digestive system baird and hooker 2000 moreover the ingested plastic debris would adsorb and concentrate hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants and hydrophilic pharmaceuticals and personal care products thus increasing the toxic exposure of organisms to various organic contaminants bakir et al 2012 chua et al 2014 liu et al 2019 mato et al 2001 rios et al 2007 velzeboer et al 2014 as a result photo irradiation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa ctab could significantly enhance the adsorption of aromatic compounds of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity thus increasing the potential risks of pvc mps in the environment 4 conclusion our results demonstrated that the presence of both iaa and ctab could efficiently enhance the reductive dechlorination of pvc mps under neutral ph and simulated irradiation conditions which is an unpublished route for the degradation of pvc powders in natural environment iaa is a representative of indole derivatives which is widely distributed in natural environments in part per million mg l 1 level di martino et al 2003 tian et al 2015 and even reach dozens of mg l 1 under specific conditions e g coking and swine wastewater lee et al 2002 li et al 2003 furthermore ctab were frequently detected in various environmental matrices due to the extensive use for domestic and industrial purposes shrivas and wu 2007 due to the formation of neutral iaa ctab complex driven by electrostatic force the adsorption of iaa on pvc pellets was significantly enhanced thus improving the reductive efficiency of eaq derived from iaa photolysis by shortening electron transfer distance to pvc mp surface therefore the synergistic effect between iaa and ctab provided a new photoreduction pathway for the transformation of pvc microplastics in the natural environments moreover the pvc mps irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab exhibited enhanced adsorption capacity for both nonpolar and polar aromatic compounds due to the hydrophobic effects and π π interactions between aromatic rings and polyene structures in pvc mp surface therefore it is reasonable that pvc mps could undergo similar dechlorination process in the presence of other cationic surfactants and indole derivatives declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17210,in this study a new photo irradiated reductive dechlorination pathway and the underlying transformation mechanism are described for poly vinyl chloride microplastics pvc mps pvc mps underwent photo reductive dechlorination process with the release of chloride ions this reaction could be facilitated in the presence of indole 3 acetic acid iaa and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab under neutral ph and simulated sunlight irradiation conditions electrostatic interaction between iaa and ctab produced neutral iaa ctab complex which might account for the enhanced adsorption of iaa on pvc powders upon photo irradiation the adsorbed iaa was excited to generate hydrated electrons eaq which could pass through a shorter distance to pvc mp surface than that derived from homogeneous iaa molecules in aqueous solution transient spectra of laser flash photolysis provided direct evidence for the generation of eaq which supported the proposed dechlorination mechanism based on the results of attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir and raman spectra c cl bond cleavage and polyene formation were involved in the structural transformation of pvc mps due to the hydrophobic effects and π π interactions between aromatic rings and polyene structures in pvc mp surface the pvc mp powders irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab showed an enhanced sorption for

decade the marine environment is reported to be the major sink of mps browne et al 2011 cole et al 2011 however various mps e g polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene have been detected in wastewater treatment plants mahon et al 2016 in many freshwater areas castañeda et al 2014 eriksen et al 2013 mccormick et al 2014 and even in polar regions lusher et al 2014 due to the excellent chemical and physical properties poly vinyl chloride pvc has been widely applied in the synthesis of industrial and domestic products and china has exceeded usa to be the largest producer as indicated in the report of 2013 worldwide pvc production however the final destination of pvc plastics is to be in the waste after their usage or due to insufficient quality during production process actually the presence of macro and micro sized debris of pvc has been reported in various environmental matrices in previous researches including sediments and sandy beaches along estuarine shorelines browne et al 2010 it was found that pvc microplastic pvc mp was one of the most common microscopic plastic debris in sandy beaches which comprised 25 of total mps in estuaries browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 moreover as indicated by the results of pvc mp toxicity assessments intestinal damage suppressed feeding activity and increased lethality were observed for zebrafish danio rerio lugworm arenicola marina and nematode caenorhabditis elegans respectively lei et al 2018 it was well known that several reductive dechlorination reactions widely happen in the environments such as anaerobic reduction processes induced by microbes and reductive minerals bunge et al 2003 lee and batchelor 2002 moreover as the most active reducing species the hydrated electron eaq could be generated from indole or its derivatives in aqueous solution under ultraviolet light irradiation hart and boag 1962 verlet et al 2005 various organic contaminants have been reported to be reduced by eaq e g nitro aromatic and perfluorinated compounds qu et al 2010 song et al 2013 tian et al 2016 tian et al 2015 dehydrochlorination characterized by the formation of polyene sequences is also one of the most common transformation routes for pvc plastics under natural weathering conditions jakubowicz 2001 therefore pvc mps distributed in the environments may undergo natural dechlorination reaction with environmental reducing species however due to the hydrophobic surfaces of pvc mps and short lifetime of polar eaq the reduction reaction between pvc mps and eaq would be inhibited under environmentally relevant conditions therefore a proper medium is needed to improve the reductive performance of eaq for pvc mp dechlorination as commonly used surface active compounds the cationic surfactants have been extensively utilized in industrial and commercial products agrawal et al 2004 mckane and kandel 1996 the widespread application of cationic surfactants implies that these compounds are expected to be present in various environmental matrices including water soil and sediment agrawal et al 2004 shrivas and wu 2007 it was reported by shrivas and wu 2007 that the concentration of a commonly used cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab could reach 102 μg l 1 in river water and municipal wastewater recently many researches have reported the interfacial electron transfer assisted by surfactants tunuli and fendler 1981 found that surfactant vesicles exhibited adverse impacts on photosensitized electron transfer and charge separation additionally chen et al 2020 reported that ctab could bridge the gap between indole 3 acetic acid iaa and perfluorooctanoic acid by reversing the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion thus enhancing the defluorination efficiency by eaq derived from iaa therefore it is expected that the interaction between indoles and ctab may promote the transformation of pvc mps by eaq in this study iaa was selected as the model indole derivative due to its prior eaq yield and widespread existence in the environments chen and kenny 2007 miura et al 2011 zhang et al 1999 tian and gu 2018 the objective of this study was i to investigate the photo transformation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa and ctab ii to ascertain the roles of eaq in pvc mp transformation with multiple techniques iii to explore the enhanced dechlorination mechanism of pvc mps by eaq derived from iaa coexisting with ctab iv to gain insights into the adsorption capacity of photo aged pvc mps for polar and nonpolar aromatic compounds our experimental results provide the first evidence for the reductive dechlorination of pvc mps by photo generated eaq which would improve the understanding of the transformation and potential risks of mps in aquatic environments and even shed light on the future treatment of mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals guaranteed reagent pvc pellets with diameters of 300 nm were

usa methanol of hplc grade was obtained from merck darmstadt germany milli q water 18 2 mω cm was used in all the experiments 2 2 preparation of iaa ctab complexes prior to synthesis of iaa ctab complexes 2000 μm iaa and 200 μm ctab stock solutions were firstly prepared by dissolving 200 μmol iaa and 20 μmol ctab into 100 ml deoxygenated water respectively the as prepared solutions were adjusted to ph 7 by adding 0 1 m naoh and hcl solutions subsequently the iaa ctab mixture with iaa ctab molar ratio of 10 1 was synthesized by mixing 2000 μm iaa and 200 μm ctab stock solutions with equal volume this molar ratio was optimized based on the results of preliminary experiments as shown in fig s1 comparing to the dechlorination reaction at iaa ctab ratio of 10 1 much weaker enhancement in pvc mp dechlorination was obtained when the concentrations of ctab increased or decreased notably quartz vessels were utilized in all the experiments to avoid ion leaching resulting from reagent preparation and storage in borosilicate glass 2 3 photo transformation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa ctab complexes under different oxygen conditions the photo transformation experiments were conducted in a simulated natural aqueous solution 40 ml containing pvc mps 100 mg l 1 iaa 100 μm and ctab 10 μm the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding 0 1 m hclo4 and 0 1 m

temperature around 25 c the light intensity was measured as 40 mw cm 2 on the surface of the quartz reaction tube by a radiometer cel np2000 10 ceaulight inc beijing china prior to the photo irradiation experiments deoxygenation of all water was conducted by boiling and nitrogen purging to obtain ultrapure water containing different concentrations of dissolved oxygen do a do meter and probe sg6 mettler toledo inc usa was used to quantify the oxygen doses and the initial do values were determined to be 0 1 10 9 85 7 and 252 3 µm a magnetic bar was placed in each tube to obtain pvc mp suspensions at predetermined time interval samples were sacrificed and the released cl concentrations during the photoreaction were measured using an ion chromatography dionex co usa for comparison similar treatments were conducted for pvc mps only pvc mps in the presence of iaa termed as pvc iaa and pvc mps in the presence of ctab termed as pvc ctab respectively in order to confirm the contribution of eaq on the transformation of pvc mps similar experiments were also conducted for reaction solutions fully deoxygenated with n2o for 60 min notably the parafilms were used to obtain isolation of reaction solutions from air for all samples during the photo irradiation period 2 4 analysis of transient species by laser flash photolysis and electron paramagnetic resonance epr the laser flash system equipped with a nd yag laser quanta ray lab 150 10 spectra physics operated at 266 nm was used to determine the generated transient species upon photo irradiation at room temperature the concentrations of iaa and ctab were set as 100 µm and 10 µm respectively the experiments were conducted according to the method reported by tian et al 2015 briefly a spectrophotometrical method was used to monitor transient reactive species the emission light from a 150 w xenon arc lamp xbo 150 w cr ofr osram was focused to pass through a 1 1 cm quartz cell subsequently entering the programmable f 3 4 grating monochromator on the other hand the analytical light also passed through the quartz cell in a perpendicular direction to the laser beam eaq were generated by photolysis of iaa with laser energy of 14 0 mj per pulse in order to confirm the contribution from eaq transient spectra were recorded for n2 and n2o saturated sample solutions respectively the bruker epr spectrometer x2 band a300 6 1 was employed to collect the epr spectra of iaa and iaa ctab purged with n2 or n2o at room temperature a 100 w mercury lamp ush 102d ushio japan was utilized as the irradiation light source dmpo was served as the probe molecule to capture reactive species generated during the radiation period the initial concentrations of dmpo iaa and ctab were 10 0 1 0 and 0 1 mm respectively the microwave frequency modulation frequency microwave power modulation amplitude and receiver gain were set as 9 76 ghz 100 khz 20 mw 1 0 g and 1 0 103 respectively 2 5 characterization of pristine and aged pvc mps the structural changes of pvc mps after 96 h photo irradiation were investigated by a microscope of attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy micro atr ftir bruker hyperion 2000 ettlingen germany with ir spectra range of 600 2000 cm 1 and the ft iris fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy images were recorded for newly occurring functional groups after photo irradiation for all samples the analyzed surface with area of 100 μm 75 μm was referred to a grid of 10 points in x and y axis and each point corresponded to an ir spectrum the caf2 window was used as the support for pvc pellets and its ir spectrum was collected to correct the signal from background to trace the whole reaction process on the pvc mp surface time resolved raman spectra tr raman were recorded using a jobin yvon spectrometer xplora plus horiba scientific equipped with a 514 nm laser bonding information of pvc mp surfaces was analyzed using a labspec6 spectroscopy suite software an olympus bx41 microscope equipped with two objectives i e 10 olympus mplann and 50 olympus lmplanfl was utilized to focus the laser beam on and to collect the raman scattered light from the pvc mp particles 2 6 theoretical calculation gaussian 09w program frisch et al 2009 with dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to investigate structures of iaa ctab and pvc to simplify the calculation six monomers of pvc were utilized for gaussian simulation wang et al 2020 the 6 311g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of iaa ctab and pvc i e c h n o and cl moreover on the basis of the optimized geometries the bonding lengths and the frontier molecular orbitals i e homo the highest occupied molecular orbital and lumo the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were calculated to investigate the underlying degradation mechanism for pvc mp dechlorination 2 7 sorption of phenanthrene and 1 naphthol to pvc mps the adsorption capacities of pristine and photo irradiated pvc mps were assessed according to the method reported by wang et al 2015 the pvc mps after photo reaction in the absence or presence of iaa ctab were collected and rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water for at least three times to remove ctab and iaa residues prior to the adsorption isotherm experiments phenanthrene and 1 naphthol were selected as the representative nonpolar and polar model contaminants respectively for each experiment 3 0 mg light treated pvc mps were added into a 50 ml glass centrifuge tube containing 30 0 ml phenanthrene or 1 naphthol solution with the initial concentrations in the range of 0 5 50 0 µg l 1 the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 using 1 mm phosphate buffer the centrifuge tubes were capped and shaken on a rotary shaker 200 rpm is rdv1 crystal usa at 25 c for 24 h in the dark and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 60 min similar experiments were also conducted for pristine pvc mp powders as control no significant loss during the adsorption process was observed as indicated by 98 9 recovery the concentrations of phenanthrene and 1 naphthol were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc water alliance 2695 milford ma equipped with a waters 2475 fluorescence detector the excitation and emission wavelengths were 250 and 364 nm and an agilent c18 reverse phase column 5 µm 4 6 150 mm acetonitrile water 80 20 v v was served as the mobile phase and the flow rate was set as 1 ml min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo transformation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa ctab under varied oxygen conditions as shown in fig 1 a under anaerobic condition do concentration 0 1 µm the released cl concentration of pvc mps after 96 h light irradiation was 10 73 µm 0 67 dechlorination ratio and the presence of ctab enhanced this value to 16 06 µm 1 00 dechlorination ratio whereas iaa exhibited significant promotion for pvc mp dechlorination in the first 24 h but obvious inhibition occurred in the following reaction period with the 96 h dechlorination ratio of 0 52 interestingly the presence of iaa ctab increased dechlorination ratio of pvc mp particles up to 2 06 therefore the joint action of iaa and ctab could increase the chloride release by 3 1 4 0 and 2 1 times compared with pvc mps only pvc iaa and pvc ctab respectively this suggested that a synergistic effect between iaa and ctab existed in the light irradiated transformation process of pvc mps the addition of ctab also increased the concentration of released chloride ions for pvc ctab system by comparison with pvc and pvc iaa systems which could be attributed to the enhanced dispersion and disaggregation by this cationic surface active agent eitzen et al 2018 vaisman et al 2006 vroom et al 2017 the effect of do on pvc mp photo transformation was investigated by changing the initial do concentrations as show in fig 1 do showed negligible effect on the 96 h dechlorination in pvc mps only pvc iaa and pvc ctab systems however for pvc iaa ctab system the cl release was significantly inhibited with the increasing do concentrations the determined concentrations of released cl in pvc iaa ctab system were 33 0 21 7 16 5 and 12 5 µm for do dosages of 0 1 10 9 85 7 and 252 3 µm respectively fig 1 this could be explained by the fast reaction of eaq with o2 thus quenching the reductive dechlorination induced by eaq tian et al 2016 n2o has been confirmed to be an effective quencher for eaq with the production of n2 hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radical oh okazaki and takeshita 2018 zhang et al 2018 thus reaction solutions were purged with n2o gas to eliminate the impacts of eaq as shown in fig s2 a significant decrease in dechlorination was observed for pvc iaa and pvc iaa ctab systems purged with n2o while no effects were obtained for pvc and pvc ctab groups the efficient scavenge by n2o further confirmed the major contribution of eaq derived from iaa photolysis based on our results ctab played an important role in the photo dechlorination process of pvc mps it was proposed that the formation of iaa ctab complex promoted the sorption of iaa on the surface of pvc powders thus shortening the transfer distance of eaq from iaa to pvc mp surfaces this hypothesis was further confirmed by adsorption kinetics of iaa to pvc mps in the presence or absence of ctab as illustrated in fig 2 the addition of ctab significantly enhanced the adsorption rate and equilibrium adsorption capacity of iaa on pvc mp powders at room temperature in the first 1 h the adsorption amount of iaa q was 6 0 and 94 8 µmol g 1 for pvc iaa and pvc iaa ctab systems respectively indicating that ctab was able enhance the adsorption rate this dramatic increase in adsorption rate could be attributed to the formation of more hydrophobic neutral complex of iaa ctab by comparison with iaa anion iaa is a weak acid with the dissociation constant pk a of 4 60 4 75 raven 1975 thus the ionized iaa would be the major existing species under the experimental conditions ph 7 therefore the negatively charged iaa would interact with the cationic surfactant ctab via electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic effect which has been reported in our previous studies chen et al 2020 given the electronegative property of pvc mp surfaces due to the presence of chlorine element the electrostatic repulsion inevitably inhibited the sorption of ionized iaa on pvc mps the adsorption equilibrium could be obtained within 24 h and the maximum adsorption amount was 232 9 µmol g 1 for pvc iaa ctab system which was 2 2 times greater than that of the system without ctab the significant increase in iaa adsorption could be attributed to the ctab induced reversion of the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged iaa and electronegative pvc mps once iaa was adsorbed the generated eaq derived from iaa photolysis could reach pvc mp surface via a shorter transfer distance comparing with homogenous iaa in aqueous solution thus achieving higher reductive dechlorination efficiency 3 2 laser flash photolysis epr micro atr ftir and raman analysis to further explore the underlying reaction mechanism laser flash photolysis micro atr ftir and raman measurements were conducted fig 3 a showed the absorption spectra of the transient intermediates in the range of 450 750 nm upon photolysis of iaa 100 µm and iaa ctab 100 µm 10 µm in n2 and n2o purged solutions the broad and asymmetric optical absorption peak around 690 nm could be assigned to eaq which is consistent with the theoretical and experimental results reported by previous researchers abramczyk and kroh 1991 hart and boag 1962 tian and gu 2018 this characteristic absorption band was efficiently scavenged by n2o further confirming the contribution from eaq in addition the production and decay of eaq was observed for iaa and iaa ctab aqueous solutions saturated with n2 fig 3b but not for n2 purged ultrapure water and ctab solution indicating that the formation of eaq was derived from iaa photolysis based on the determined absorbance and published extinction coefficient at 690 nm 20 560 m 1 cm 1 sauer et al 2004 the yield of eaq were calculated to be 4 23 10 6 m and 3 34 10 6 m for iaa and iaa ctab solutions respectively the decay of eaq occurred when adding ctab indicating that the presence of ctab was able to inhibit the production of eaq this phenomenon could be attributed to the recombination of eaq with the positively charged nitrogen atom of quaternary ammonia chen et al 2020 the generation of eaq was further confirmed by the results of epr as shown in fig 3c the signal of eaq as indicated by dmpo h was observed for both n2 purged iaa and iaa ctab which is consistent with the results of laser transient spectra after purging with n2o the characteristic peaks of eaq vanished while the signals of hydroxyl radicals were strengthened which could be attributed to the production of oh via the reaction between eaq and n2o okazaki and takeshita 2018 zhang et al 2018 therefore according to our experimental results ctab was able to enhance the transformation of pvc mps by promoting the eaq induced dechlorination process self quenching reactions also occurred to diminish the eaq to get further insights into the underlying transformation mechanism the micro atr ftir technique was utilized to monitor the photo induced alteration of pvc mps the simulated solar irradiation could achieve release of chloride ions thus leading to the changes in surface functional groups of pvc mps wang et al 2020 the peaks at 617 and 695 cm 1 were assigned to c cl stretching in pvc syndiotactic and isotactic sequences respectively fig 4 a d quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 the rocking and deformation modes of ch2 occurred at 836 and 1334 cm 1 fig 4a d quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 the peaks at 962 1254 and 1428 cm 1 were referred to trans ch wagging ch rocking and ch deformation respectively fig 4a d quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 comparing with the ftir spectrum of original pvc mp sample fig s3 a new band at 1594 cm 1 was observed and assigned to c c stretching rajendran and uma 2001 the formation of c c double bond could be attributed to the photo irradiated dechlorination process moreover the enhanced dechlorination of pvc mps treated with iaa ctab was also confirmed by the stronger relative peak intensity of c c stretching mode furthermore ft iris images fig 4e h were collected for visualization of the relative peak intensity based on the absorbance of c c double bond around 1600 cm 1 with pixels ranging in color from blue to light purple absorbance 2 12 compared to the controls before light irradiation fig s4a d the surfaces of all photo irradiated pvc mps exhibited various distribution of color ranging from light blue to light purple the greatest absorbance as indicated by color of light green light blue light red and light purple were observed for samples treated with simulated solar irradiation in the presence of pvc pvc iaa pvc ctab and pvc iaa ctab respectively which is consistent with the relative peak intensity of c c double bond in ftir spectra the occurrence of c c double bond was further confirmed by raman analysis as illustrated in fig 5 c cl stretching c c bending and c h bending occurred at 635 697 1113 and 1436 cm 1 respectively ellahi et al 1995 prokhorov et al 2016 interestingly a new peak around 1510 cm 1 was observed and strengthened with increasing irradiation time and the new peak referred to the conjugated c c stretching mode ellahi et al 1995 in order to obtain the accurate length of conjugated polyene sequence n baruya et al 1983 established a reliable relationship between the c c stretching frequency v 2 and n eq 1 based on the raman spectra v 2 1515 1515 1509 and 1506 cm 1 so the conjugated polyene sequence length was calculated to be n 13 13 14 and 15 for pvc mps irradiated for 12 24 48 and 96 h respectively therefore the photo transformation of pvc mps assisted by iaa ctab complexes could promote the generation of polyene structures with sequence length ranging from 13 to 15 1 v 2 1461 151 24 e 0 07808 n 3 3 elucidation of photo transformation mechanism pvc mps underwent dechlorination process in the absence or presence of iaa ctab complexes and a possible dechlorination mechanism was proposed based on previous studies and theoretical calculations it is generally accepted that the photochemical degradation of pvc proceeds primarily via two different mechanisms ionic and radical type routes rånby et al 1978 in both degradation pathways alkene or polyene linkages were produced and dehyrochlorination process happened when exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet radiation jakubowicz 2001 jian et al 1991 matuana et al 2001 it has been reported that random dehydrochlorination of the pvc occurred at the beginning of polymer decomposition which generated polyene sequences with the maximum lengths of 10 16 units in further steps rånby et al 1978 as shown in the fig s5a the alteration of pvc mps by simulated solar irradiation was initiated by the cleavage of c cl bond with the formation of carbocation r1 and chloride ions r1 underwent fast dehydrogenation producing alkene containing p1 due to the formation of c c double bond the c cl bond adjacent to c c was lengthened from 1 809 å r1 to 1 856 å p1 and 1 865 å p2 based on the dft optimized results fig s5b since a negative relationship existed between bond energy and bond length the longer c cl bond in p1 and p2 was susceptible to cleavage moreover the dechlorination route was also supported by the results of homo and lumo orbitals fig s5c and d the enhanced photo irradiated dechlorination of pvc mps by eaq derived from iaa ctab complexes were also investigated as shown in fig s6a it was proposed that eaq would attack c cl bond of pvc mps first generating a radical r2 and cl the produced r2 underwent electron spin resonance and abstracted hydrogen atom from adjacent ch2 forming a new radical r3 comparing with that of r2 the length of c cl bond adjacent to radical site in r3 increased by 0 092 å fig s6b the extended c cl bond was more facile to be attacked by eaq with the generation of p3 containing c c double bond the calculated frontier molecular orbitals were visually illustrated for the dechlorination reaction spot by eaq fig s6c and d 3 4 sorption of phenanthrene and 1 naphthol onto pristine and photo altered pvc mps considering both ftir and raman results of light treated pvc mps photo induced chlorine elimination and c c formation would inevitably change the physiochemical properties of pvc mp surfaces therefore the adsorption of organic contaminants was evaluated for pristine and photo irradiated pvc mp powders phenanthrene and 1 naphthol were selected as the representative nonpolar and polar aromatic pollutants as shown in fig 6 a the sorption of phenanthrene on pvc mps followed the langmuir isotherm model with the maximum sorption q max of 54 02 51 76 53 18 and 70 75 µg g 1 for photo altered pvc mps and pvc mps irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab and iaa ctab respectively table s1 by comparison with the sorption capacity on pristine pvc mps q max 49 43 µg g 1 significant enhancement in the sorption of nonpolar phenanthrene was obtained for pvc mps suffering from light irradiation especially for those irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab figs 6a and s6a the enhancement in phenanthrene adsorption could be attributed to hydrophobic effects and π π interactions interestingly comparing with virgin mps fig s7b photo altered pvc mp particles also exhibited an obvious enhancement in the sorption of 1 naphthol fig 6b the 1 naphthol adsorption on pvc mps can be fitted with henry isotherm model with the respective adsorption coefficients k d of 0 14 0 15 0 16 0 24 and 0 36 l g 1 for pristine pvc pvc pvc iaa pvc ctab and pvc iaa ctab table s2 the enhanced adsorption might be attributed to π π interactions between benzene ring in 1 naphnol and polyene structure in the skeleton of photo altered pvc mps therefore photo induced dechlorination and generated polyene structures could promote the adsorption of both hydrophobic nonpolar and polar aromatic chemicals it has been reported that one potential hazard of microplastics is to be ingested by wildlife which might block the wildlife s digestive system baird and hooker 2000 moreover the ingested plastic debris would adsorb and concentrate hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants and hydrophilic pharmaceuticals and personal care products thus increasing the toxic exposure of organisms to various organic contaminants bakir et al 2012 chua et al 2014 liu et al 2019 mato et al 2001 rios et al 2007 velzeboer et al 2014 as a result photo irradiation of pvc mps in the presence of iaa ctab could significantly enhance the adsorption of aromatic compounds of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity thus increasing the potential risks of pvc mps in the environment 4 conclusion our results demonstrated that the presence of both iaa and ctab could efficiently enhance the reductive dechlorination of pvc mps under neutral ph and simulated irradiation conditions which is an unpublished route for the degradation of pvc powders in natural environment iaa is a representative of indole derivatives which is widely distributed in natural environments in part per million mg l 1 level di martino et al 2003 tian et al 2015 and even reach dozens of mg l 1 under specific conditions e g coking and swine wastewater lee et al 2002 li et al 2003 furthermore ctab were frequently detected in various environmental matrices due to the extensive use for domestic and industrial purposes shrivas and wu 2007 due to the formation of neutral iaa ctab complex driven by electrostatic force the adsorption of iaa on pvc pellets was significantly enhanced thus improving the reductive efficiency of eaq derived from iaa photolysis by shortening electron transfer distance to pvc mp surface therefore the synergistic effect between iaa and ctab provided a new photoreduction pathway for the transformation of pvc microplastics in the natural environments moreover the pvc mps irradiated in the presence of iaa ctab exhibited enhanced adsorption capacity for both nonpolar and polar aromatic compounds due to the hydrophobic effects and π π interactions between aromatic rings and polyene structures in pvc mp surface therefore it is reasonable that pvc mps could undergo similar dechlorination process in the presence of other cationic surfactants and indole derivatives declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17211,recent studies indicate that ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa may play an important role in nitrogen removal by wastewater treatment plants wwtps however our knowledge of the mechanisms employed by aoa for growth and survival in full scale wwtps is still limited here metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with a laboratory cultivation experiment revealed that three active aoas ws9 ws192 and ws208 belonging to family nitrososphaeraceae were active in the deep oxidation ditch dod of a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate which is configured with three continuous aerobic anoxic oa modules with low intensity aeration 1 5 mg l aoa coexisted with aob and complete ammonia oxidizers comammox while the ammonia oxidizing microbial aom community was unexpectedly dominated by the novel aoa strain ws9 the low aeration long retention time and relatively high inputs of ammonium and copper might be responsible for the survival of aoa over aob and comammox while the dominance of ws9 specifically may be enhanced by substrate preference and uniquely encoded retention strategies the urease negative ws9 is specifically adapted for ammonia acquisition as evidenced by the high expression of an ammonium transporter whereas two metabolically versatile urease positive aoa strains ws192 and ws208 can likely supplement ammonia needs with urea this study provides important information for the survival and application of the eutrophic nitrososphaeraceae aoa and advances our understanding of archaea dominated ammonia oxidation in a full scale wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia oxidation nitrososphaeraceae aoa landfill leachate low aeration copper ions deep oxidation ditch 1 introduction ammonia oxidation to nitrite represents the first and rate limiting step in nitrification and is a crucial process linking mineralization to nitrogen loss processes it was long understood to be performed exclusively by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob which are affiliated with beta and gamma proteobacteria purkhold et al 2000 but this changed significantly after the isolation of an ammonia oxidizing archaeon aoa nitrosopumilus maritimus könneke et al 2005 archaeal ammonia monooxygenase amo encoded by all studied aoa catalyzes aerobic ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine vajrala et al 2013 the first step of nitrification but the enzyme responsible for the second step to nitrite production is presumed to be an unidentified archaeal hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and the contributing cofactors also remain unknown vajrala et al 2013 walker et al 2010 it has been repeatedly proposed that a multicopper oxidase could be the archaeal hao santoro et al 2015 walker et al 2010 molecular surveys of diagnostic genes such as the ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa and 16s rrna genes have detected aoa in nearly every niche on the earth alves et al 2018 suggesting that aoa play a critical role in global nitrogen cycling aoa are generally considered to be highly specialized chemolithoautotrophs that acquire energy from ammonia oxidation and use co2 as the sole carbon source kim et al 2016 but this perception has been challenged by several studies suggesting that aoa are metabolically flexible in some cases alternative substrates provide the necessary ammonia and carbon dioxide for growth for example aoa can convert urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide jung et al 2016 kitzinger et al 2018 qin et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 a process that is particularly important in acidic soils lu et al 2012 cyanate was also identified as a source of ammonia and carbon dioxide for aerobic growth of the moderately thermophilic aoa nitrososphaeragargensis palatinszky et al 2015 and some marine aoa kitzinger et al 2018 however other evidence points to substrates other than ammonia it has been reported that an amoa carrying thaumarchaeota in a wwtp showed no incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate or oxidation of ammonia but was instead proposed to use alternative energy and carbon sources mußmann et al 2011 other reports suggest that the response of aoa may be linked to the mineralization of soil organic matter rather than with specific nitrogen substrates in alkaline soil tzanakakis et al 2018 and acidic soil stopnišek et al 2010 however observed stimulatory effects of organic substrates ie α ketoic acids on archaeal ammonia oxidation qin et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 were recently demonstrated to be linked to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species especially h2o2 via a nonenzymatic decarboxylation reaction rather than to mixotrophy kim et al 2016 qin et al 2017b at this time the physiological versatility of aoa is not clearly understood whether aoa are indeed metabolically flexible is an open question a growing body of literature is focused on understanding which environmental conditions favor aoa over aob it is well understood that aoa can outnumber their bacterial counterparts in oligotrophic ecosystems by several orders of magnitude this is true in marine systems horak et al 2013 radax et al 2012 ammonium depleted soils leininger et al 2006 acidic soils zhang et al 2012 arctic soils alves et al 2013 hot springs chen et al 2016 weidler et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 and hydrothermal vents wang et al 2009 these oligotrophic aoa are believed to possess a higher affinity for ammonia than aob kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 prosser and nicol 2012 straka et al 2019 in contrast aob are understood to dominate ammonia oxidizing communities in eutrophic environments such as most wastewater treatment systems most likely due to their copiotrophic growth characteristics gao et al 2013 verhamme et al 2011 wells et al 2009 this dichotomy has been challenged more recently like aob nitrososphaeraceae aoa possess copiotrophic growth characteristics and can tolerate higher ammonia concentrations than other thaumarcheal isolates jung et al 2016 lehtovirta morley et al 2016 tourna et al 2011 furthermore nitrososphaeraceae aoa outnumber aob in some eutrophic wwtps bai et al 2012 mußmann et al 2011 pan et al 2018 pornkulwat et al 2018 roy et al 2017 sauder et al 2012 and may also outcompete aob in some hypoxic reactors lian et al 2014 park et al 2006 kinetic respirometry assays have confirmed that aoa can have a much higher affinity for oxygen than aob jung et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 park et al 2010 straka et al 2019 and that dissolved oxygen do concentration appears to be an important determinant for the success of aoa in eutrophic wastewater treatment systems it was reported that marine aoa available in pure culture could sustain high ammonia oxidation activity at low oxygen concentrations 10 µm qin et al 2017b low oxygen levels caused the preferential enrichment of marine ca nitrosopumilus maritimus over aob in laboratory reactor it has been shown that aoa in wwtps prefer low do aerated anoxic conditions park et al 2006 and are inhibited by high do concentrations chen et al 2017 in addition to do copper availability has been identified as important for the success of aoa because copper ions are essential for numerous copper dependent enzymes associated with ammonia oxidation electron transfer and other physiological functions beaumont et al 2004 carini et al 2018 gwak et al 2020 lieberman and rosenzweig 2005 one explanation for the general lack of aoa in wwtp may arise from the copper limitation of archaeal nitrification which occurs in municipal wwtps through the sequestration of copper by organic compounds and may be alleviated by copper supplementation gwak et al 2020 ammonia oxidation efficiency in biological rapid sand filters for drinking water production was significantly affected by copper availability wagner et al 2016 aoa have been recognized to be the primary nitrifiers in the marine environment but even there archaeal ammonia oxidation activity might be limited by the copper bioavailability of seawater amin et al 2013 although the occurrence of aoa in full scale wwtps has been widely reported our knowledge of the specific survival strategies contributing to the success of aoa in the complex wastewater treatment systems is still lacking in this study aoa were identified in the low intensity aeration deep oxidation ditch dod of a full scale wwtp archaeal ammonia oxidation activity was verified by a batch cultivation environmental conditions that favor the survival of aoa were investigated and the ecological flexibilities of aoa were probed through metatranscriptomics and comparative genomics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection sequencing and data analysis activated sludge was collected from the nitrifying deep oxidation ditch dod of wenshan ws wwtp in taipei taichung on 25th dec 2015 table 1 approximately 150 200 m3 day of wastewater were fed into the wwtp a mixture of car wash wastewater landfill leachate and supernatant from kitchen waste compost the dod was operated with a solids retention time srt and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 25 30 and 3 6 days respectively table 1 the dod is configured as three sequential aerobic anoxic oa modules wastewater is aerated at the beginning of each module with a relatively low intensity of aeration do concentration 1 5 mg l fig 1 a sludge samples were collected at the end of the second oa module where low do concentrations 0 07 mg l were observed table 1 and fig 1a influent and effluent wastewaters of the dod were collected once a day over a one month period before the time of sampling for the measurement of ammonium nitrate and bod table 1 the concentration of copper in the influent wastewater was measured once a month for one year prior to collecting sludge table 1 the real time physicochemical data of the sampling site including ammonium concentration temperature oxidation reduction potential orp and do were measured when sampling table 1 three independent activated sludge samples technical replicates were collected from the dod and samples for dna isolation were stored at 20 c while samples for rna isolation were preserved on site in life guard soil preservation solution qiagen germany details of sampling nucleic acids extraction cdna synthesis sequencing as well as de novo metagenomic assembly binning and quality assessment have been described in a previous study yang et al 2020b briefly total dna and rna were extracted from each replicate sample and the dna or rna respectively extracted from each sample was pooled rna was converted to double stranded cdna the acquired dna and cdna were used for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing respectively the filtered and trimmed metagenomic datasets were assembled de novo using idba ud v1 1 1 peng et al 2012 with the following parameters mink 65 maxk 145 step 8 and resulting scaffolds were binned using maxbin with the setting min contig length 2500 wu et al 2014 finally in total 337 mags including three aoa mags ws9 ws192 and ws208 two aob mags ws89 and ws186 two comammox mags ws110 and ws238 and two nob mags ws74 and ws250 were obtained the completeness and contamination level of the acquired mags were estimated using checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 short metagenomic reads were mapped to mags by bowtie2 v2 2 9 ben and steven 2012 with the default settings to calculate the abundances of genomes as rpkm robinson and oshlack 2010 the relative abundances of all nitrifiers were calculated based on their genome abundances against the total genome abundance of all the obtained mags in the dod system the rrna reads were identified and removed from metatranscriptomic datasets using ribopicker schmieder et al 2012 non rrna metatranscriptomic reads were mapped to the predicted genes by bwa v0 7 17 li and durbin 2009 with the default settings to calculate the gene transcript as rpkm rpkm number of mapped reads gene length 1 000 total mapped reads 1 000 000 2 2 aerobic ammonia oxidation activity of aoa fresh activated sludge suspension was inoculated 10 v v into a modified ammonia oxidizing microbial aom medium lebedeva et al 2013 with 0 5 mm nh4cl and incubated aerobically at 28 c statically the medium was amended with allylthiourea atu 20 μm and chlorate 50 μm an antibiotic mixture of ampicillin and penicillin g each at 50 μg ml to selectively inhibit the growth of aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and other bacteria respectively jung et al 2014 jung et al 2011 the ph of the medium was maintained around 7 6 by a nahco3 buffering system during culturing and incubation the concentrations of nh4 no2 and no3 were measured every other day before the amended nh4 was fully oxidized the concentration of nh4 hood nowotny et al 2010 kandeler and gerber 1988 no2 and no3 miranda et al 2001 was measured spectrophotometrically the batch culturing was carried out in three technical replicates 2 3 genome annotation aoa mags acquired from the metagenomic dataset were annotated by ghostkoala which is kegg s internal annotation tool for k number assignment of kegg genes using ssearch computation kanehisa et al 2016 besides predicted orfs were also annotated by eggnog mapper v5 0 huerta cepas et al 2017 and rapid annotation using subsystem technology rast v2 0 overbeek et al 2014 predicted orfs were also searched against the ncbi non redundant nr by blastp using an e value 10 10 as threshold with the setting max target seqs 3 to acquire more annotation 2 4 phylogenetic analysis checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 was used to produce an alignment of 43 concatenated markers from the three newly acquired mags as well as previously published aoa genomes completeness 50 contamination 10 table s1 available at the end of december 2018 to produce a dataset for a 16s rrna phylogeny the 16s rrna gene sequences of the three newly acquired mags were used as queries in blastn searches against the ncbi nt database the top 100 hits for each were downloaded and clustered by usearch cluster fast https drive5 com usearch manual cmd cluster fast html with an identity of 97 the cluster representatives of downloaded 16s rrna gene sequences were appended to the 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from aoa genomes sequences of amoa were extracted from all known aoa genomes for phylogenetic analysis 16s rrna gene and amoa sequences were aligned with mafft v7 427 yamada et al 2016 and gaps in alignment were removed using trimal v1 2 with the setting gt 0 1 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 maximum likelihood trees of the concatenated marker alignment amoa and 16s rrna gene were constructed using iq tree v1 6 2 with models of lg f r10 lg r3 and tim3 f r2 chosen by model finder of iq tree respectively nguyen et al 2015 putative nife hydrogenases identified in aoa genomes were classified by the hyddb online server https services birc au dk hyddb søndergaard et al 2016 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of group 3b nife hydrogenase sequences identified in aoa genomes was built as described above using the model lg f r8 with reference sequences downloaded from hyddb annotated a subunits of aoa atpases were downloaded from ncbi nr and used to build a custom blastp database additional a subunits of aoa atpase were identified by blastp searches against the custom database with an identity cutoff of 40 and alignment length 50 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the identified a subunits of aoa atpase was built as described above using the model lg r4 annotated purple acid phosphatase sequences were downloaded from ncbi and uniprotkb downloaded sequences were clustered by usearch cluster fast with an identity of 85 to build a custom dataset a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of purple acid phosphatases identified in aoa genomes and the custom dataset of purple acid phosphatases was built as described above using the model vt r9 all phylogenetic trees were visualized using itol letunic and bork 2019 2 5 comparative genomic analyses three aoa mags of interest were compared to known genomes of the nitrososphaeraceae aoa and 13 additional closed genomes of aoa in terms of average nucleotide identity ani using orthoani lee et al 2016 and evaluated with a species level cutoff of 95 goris et al 2007 average amino acid identity aai was calculated using the aai calculator rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 and genus level taxonomy was inferred using a cutoff of 60 80 konstantinidis et al 2017 luo et al 2014 unique genes in the three mags were identified by filtering reciprocal best blast hits altschul et al 1990 for e value 10 5 amino acid identities 40 and a minimum alignment length 50 as identification criteria for unique genes reciprocal best blast results were visualized using circlize in r gu et al 2014 the distribution of specific genes in aoa genomes was investigated by building custom databases specific gene sequences in closed genomes were downloaded from ncbi and jgi according to annotated functions manually annotated swiss prot sequences were downloaded from uniprot and merged into the above corresponding sequence pools and custom blast databases were built with the makeblastdb tool of ncbi predicted orfs from the three newly acquired mags and 26 high quality aoa genomes completeness 90 contamination 5 table s1 were searched by blastp against these functional gene databases with e value 10 5 amino acid identity 40 and minimum alignment length 50 2 6 data availability raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences can be found on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under bioproject prjna406858 these three mags ws9 ws192 and ws208 reported in this study have been deposited under accession numbers of qcwd00000000 qcwc00000000 and qcwb00000000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonia oxidation by archaea in dod activated sludge observed nitrification activity of the dod was high as illustrated by the removal of approximately 95 of the influent ammonium and complete oxidation to nitrate of 50 of the consumed ammonium table 1 fresh activated sludge collected from the dod and treated with inhibitors of aob and nob completely oxidized 0 5 mm of nh4 to no2 within eight days in the three replicates ten fold dilution while the production of no3 was not detected fig 1b the ammonia oxidation activity could be attributed to aoa because the activities of aob and nob could be selectively inhibited by the atu 20 μm chlorate 50 μm and a mixture of antibiotics gwak et al 2020 jung et al 2014 3 2 recovery and classification of aoa mags from the dod shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on the activated sludge sample collected from the dod of ws plant produced a total of 517 2 million metagenomic reads and 364 8 million metatranscriptomic reads after removing rrna reads 47 3 million non rrna metatranscriptomic reads remained three aoa mags ws9 ws192 and ws208 were obtained from the metagenomic dataset ranging in size from 1 91 to 2 45 mb and in completeness from 90 9 to 96 1 table s1 phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated marker genes fig 2 amoa fig s1a and 16s rrna genes fig s1b placed ws192 and ws208 into the genera nitrosocosmicus and nitrososphaera respectively ws192 shared 82 4 ani and 84 9 aai with ca nitrosocosmicus exaquare g61 indicating that it represented a new species of nitrosocosmicus ws208 shared 73 5 ani and 80 0 aai with nitrososphaera viennensis en76 indicating that it represented a new species within nitrososphaera fig 3 a they were thus designated ca nitrosocosmicus sp ws192 and ca nitrososphaera sp ws208 the phylogenetic placement of ws9 was unresolved using 16s or amoa fig s1 but was resolved in the concatenated marker gene tree in which it diverged as a basal lineage prior to the divergence of nitrosocosmicus and nitrososphaera fig 2 ani aai and pairwise 16s rrna gene identities were used to further evaluate the taxonomic classification of ws9 the nearly full length 16s rrna gene sequence 1 400 bp was most similar 94 46 identity to the 16s rrna gene from the known aoa strains ca nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 and ca nitrosocosmicus exaquare g61 which was marginally lower than the proposed genus cutoff 94 5 yarza et al 2014 ws9 shared less than 95 ani with any other aoa fig 3a and shared the highest aai with nitrososphaera gargensis ga9 2 59 5 fig 3b which is lower than the genus cutoff 60 80 based on aai konstantinidis et al 2017 luo et al 2014 thus ws9 likely represents a new genus which we have tentatively named ca nitrosocaenobius wenshanensis ws9 3 3 aoa are active in the dod paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing provided the first holistic insights into the activities of aoa in the full scale wwtp in total 67 9 24 5 and 62 8 of all predicted orfs from ws9 ws192 and ws208 respectively were detected in the metatranscriptomic dataset fig 4 a a much larger number of metatranscriptomic reads mapped to ws9 and ws208 than to ws192 and genes classified into most kegg functional categories were detected fig 4a transcripts were detected for genes from all three mags encoding co2 fixation 3hp 4hb cycle respiratory chain complexes i ii iii iv and atpases fig 5 as expected genes encoding key enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation amoabcx were highly transcribed and among the most abundant transcripts fig 5 fig 4b consistent with previous studies carini et al 2018 hollibaugh et al 2011 qin et al 2017a nitrite reductase nirk was highly transcribed by ws192 and ws208 fig 4b but the transcriptional abundance of the nirk encoded by the relatively abundant ws9 was lower than the nirk encoded by ws192 and ws208 which are present in lower abundance fig 4b fig 5 3 4 co existence of ammonia oxidizers in the dod aoa cooccurred with comammox nitrospira aob nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira in the nitrifying dod fig s2 interestingly the novel aoa ws9 was the most abundant aom identified in metagenomic data fig 6 a fig s2 and had the highest bulk amoa transcription fig 6b despite previous reports that aob typically dominate the aom community in eutrophic wastewater treatment systems gao et al 2013 gao et al 2014 hink et al 2018 park et al 2006 in contrast another two aoa namely ws192 and ws208 were less abundant compared to other aom fig 6a ws208 appeared to participate in ammonia oxidation with high activity according to the high amoa transcription fig 6b the high activity but lowest genome abundance reflects ws208 may lack of capability to efficiently accumulate biomass in the flowing wastewater compare to ws9 and ws208 the weak amoa transcription likely indicates ws192 had relatively low ammonia oxidation activity fig 6b comammox and aob could compete with aoa for ammonia especially aob with a higher amoa transcription compared with comammox organisms fig 6b the oxidized nitrite by aom could be further oxidized to nitrate by nob and comammox whereas nob likely dominant this process because of the high nxra transcription fig 6b the amoa and nxra gene transcripts of comammox were much lower than canonical nitrifiers fig 6b that canonical nitrifiers likely are more important in the dod the low aeration of the dod 1 5 mg l table 1 may have provided aoa a competitive advantage compared to their bacterial counterparts aob several lines of evidence suggest that some aoa favor hypoxic conditions kinetic respirometry assays have shown that aoa have a much higher affinity for oxygen than those of aob jung et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 park et al 2010 straka et al 2019 and the optimum aeration level for the enrichment of a nitrososphaera strain was shown to be 2 03 mg l chen et al 2017 the dominance of nitrososphaeraceae aoa has been consistently observed in other hypoxic wastewater treatment systems lian et al 2014 park et al 2006 in addition to low do levels long retention times 15 days srt 24 h hrt were also found to facilitate the growth of aoa park et al 2006 the presence of genes encoding for flagella was suggested to contribute to the survival of ca nitrosotenuis cloacae in wwtps by promoting biofilm formation and extending the effective retention time li et al 2016 however flagella encoding genes were absent in all three of the newly obtained aoa mags suggesting that they lack this mechanism and that their dominance is likely dependent on the long retention times 25 30 days srt and 3 6 days hrt inherent to the studied dod table 1 comammox nitrospira mags were recently assembled from the same reactor yang et al 2020a with relatively high transcriptional activities fig 6a comammox nitrospira have been reported to be dominant members of the aom community in anaerobic reactors roots et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020a and have been successfully enriched from activated sludge by cycling between anoxic or anaerobic conditions and microaerobic conditions do 0 6 mg l camejo et al 2017 relative to these conditions the oxygen level in the aeration dod do 1 5 mg l table 1 is much higher which may have prevented comammox nitrospira from having a competitive advantage against aoa additionally the high ammonium levels of the dod 118 15 mg l might be more favourable for the growth of the eutrophic nitrososphaeraceae aoa jung et al 2016 than for comammox nitrospira which have a high affinity for ammonia kits et al 2017 and can be enriched under ammonia limited conditions fujitani et al 2020 although a relatively high transcriptional activity of comammox was detected in the dod fig 6a low biomass yield might limit the abundance of comammox kits et al 2017 copper is necessary for both aoa and aob due to their physiological dependence on enzymes such as amo and copper dependent nirk which contain mono and di nuclear copper centers beaumont et al 2004 carini et al 2018 lieberman and rosenzweig 2005 aob also depend on iron fe containing metalloenzymes and proteins forelectron transfer while aoa appear to be more dependent on copper to act as a co factor in enzymes involved in their electron transfer systems gwak et al 2020 ammonia oxidation efficiency was significantly affected by copper availability in drinking water treatment systems and marine environments where aoa were the primary nitrifiers amin et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 the general lack of aoa in wwtp has been suggested to result from copper limitation on archaeal nitrification where high metal complexation potentials of organic compounds may significantly reduce copper bioavailability gwak et al 2020 although copper limitation of aoa has been observed at copper concentration levels below 1 17 10 7 mol l gwak et al 2020 higher copper levels in the studied dod 1 56 10 7 1 72 10 6 mol l table 1 may indicate a lack of copper limitation for this system although oxygen ammonia and copper concentrations appear to contribute to the high abundance of aoa in the studied dod the abundance of an organism does not always reflect its contribution to an environmental process for example oceanic ammonia and nitrite oxidation are balanced despite nob have a ten fold lower abundance than aoa in the ocean kitzinger et al 2020 thus follow up research that quantifies the actual contributions to nitrification by aoa and other nitrifiers especially the high activity but low biomass yield comammox is needed 3 5 substrate competition strategies of aoa urease enables aoa to use urea as an additional ammonia source jung et al 2016 kitzinger et al 2018 qin et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 and nitrification activity of aoa in acidic soil is primarily supported by urea lu et al 2012 urease and urea transporters were encoded and expressed by ws192 and ws208 fig 4b fig 5 all known nitrososphaeraceae aoa encode the urease except for ws9 fig s3 suggesting that ws9 may harbor a unique strategy for substrate acquisition all three aoa encoded one ammonium transporter amt1 which has been proposed to be a low affinity and high capacity transporter nakagawa and stahl 2013 rutherford et al 2008 fig s3 the high expression of amt1 by the urease negative ws9 fig 4b may provide an advantage for sequestering ammonium providing it a growth advantage in the high ammonium conditions of the dod there are other reports of aoa that utilize ionized ammonium nh4 as a substrate nh4 was deduced to be the substrate of an acidophilic aoa ca nitrosotalea devanaterra ndev1 under acidic conditions ph 5 5 at which nh3 pk a 9 3 availability is reduced by ionization lehtovirta morley et al 2011 simulations of nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 showed that charged surface layers s layers may elevate the concentration of nh4 in the pseudo periplasmic space and facilitate the uptake of nh4 as a substrate li et al 2018 however it is still unclear nh4 collection by amt in aoa is related to energy generation or only required for nitrogen assimilation 3 6 special functions of aoa in energy conversion polyphosphate kinase 2 ppk2 was encoded by ws9 and all known nitrosocosmicus fig s3 ppk2 is an enzyme catalyzing adp and atp synthesis using amp and polyphosphate as substrates motomura et al 2014 nocek et al 2008 which enables the use of polyphosphate as an intracellular energy reserve for the generation of atp and survival moreover ppk2 can catalyze polyphosphate driven nucleotide phosphorylation to maintain intracellular nucleotide pools which may allow aoa to respond to changes in nutrient concentrations and osmotic stress gangaiah et al 2010 sureka et al 2009 a putative group 3b nife hydrogenase as well as the factors required for hydrogenase maturation were encoded by ws9 and ws208 these hydrogenases form a phylogenetic clade with hydrogenases from the euryarchaeon aciduliprofundum bootstrap 85 and are distantly related to the homologous hydrogenases found in ca nitrosocaldus the only other aoa to encode these genes abby et al 2018 daebeler et al 2018 fig s3 fig 8a group 3b hydrogenases are distributed across phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea greening et al 2016 and may couple nad p h oxidation to the evolution of h2 berney et al 2014 at the temperature in the dod 20 c this reaction would be highly inefficient and could proceed only at a low partial pressure of h2 around 10 3 to 10 4 bar schink 1997 however 3b hydrogenases may also be reversible oxidizing h2 with nad p as the electron acceptor berney et al 2014 bryant and adams 1989 greening et al 2016 the expression of group 3b nife hydrogenases from aoa fig 5 may then indicate that growth and or maintenance of aoa in the complex wastewater treatment system could be supplemented by hydrogen oxidation ws9 and ws192 contained a nine subunit v type atpase specific to acidophilic acid tolerant aoa fig s5 wang et al 2019 all nine subunits of this atpase were identified in ws9 but subunit k was missing in ws192 table s2 ws208 instead encoded the eight subunit a type atpase found in neutrophilic aoa wang et al 2019 fig s5 table s2 all genes encoding the identified subunits of a type and v type atpases were transcribed fig 5 the expression of v type atpases may enhance the ability of ws9 and ws192 to maintain intracellular ph under acidic conditions ph 5 5 ca nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 was shown to transcribe the v type atpase encoding genes which was taken as evidence that the function of the v type atpase is related to ph homeostasis in aoa wang et al 2019 3 7 the unique survival strategies of the dominant aoa ws9 contained 833 genes that were absent from ws192 and ws208 fig 7 most of which could not be assigned a function the genes for which functional annotations could be assigned provided insight on why ws9 may be the most abundant aoa in the system up to six copies of putative purple acid phosphatases paps were uniquely encoded and expressed by ws9 fig 7 including four extracellular phosphatases and two intracellular phosphatases table s2 the presence of multiple paps in the catalase negative ws9 may be indicative of a diverse set of tools that fulfill a critical role in h2o2 detoxification fig s3 paps have been identified in numerous plants mammals and fungi but they are rarely found in prokaryotes schenk et al 2000a schenk et al 2013 homology models suggest that prokaryotic paps should play an important role in the removal of reactive oxygen intermediates through a fenton type reaction schenk et al 2000b the paps derived from ws9 formed a separate phylogenetic clade with a putative pap from an uncultured marine thaumarchaeote fig 8 b genes involving exopolysaccharide synthesis were examined in the three aoa mags active exopolysaccharide synthesis pathways are thought to be associated with cell aggregation and biofilm formation for specific survival advantages in ca nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 a nitrososphaeraceae aoa strain jung et al 2016 exopolysaccharide allows cells to adhere to each other or onto a surface for physical stresses resistance limoli et al 2015 and substrate acquisition jung et al 2016 which may significantly promote biomass accumulation in the flowing wastewater by ensuring that cells are not completely washed away several transcriptionally active genes with a potential role in exopolysaccharide synthesis were identified in ws9 a putative oligosaccharide flippase pglk involved in lipid linked oligosaccharide translocation and an adjacent glycosyltransferase were unique to ws9 and detected in metatranscriptomic data fig 7 fig s4 in bacteria lipid linked oligosaccharide translocation is usually associated with exopolysaccharide synthesis cell wall construction and n linked protein glycosylation hong et al 2018 perez et al 2015 genes encoding udp n acetyl d glucosamine 6 dehydrogenase cdp alcohol phosphatidyltransferase and three glycosyltransferases involved in oligosaccharideand lipid synthesis were found in the gene neighborhood of the oligosaccharide flippase and were transcriptionally active burrows et al 2000 lairson et al 2008 nogly et al 2014 fig 7 fig s4 additional transcriptionally active exopolysaccharide synthesis genes unique to ws9 were found as a separate gene cluster fig 7 fig s4 this cluster of genes included a glycosyltransferase a putative exported protein and gdp mannose dehydrogenase gmd which isinvolved in the production of an alginate precursor gdp mannuronic acid remminghorst and rehm 2006 putative glycosyltransferase encoding genes were also found in ws192 and ws208 but the adjacent oligosaccharides and lipids syntheses as well as translocation related genes were lacking 5 conclusion and implications paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing provided the first holistic insights into possible niche specialization of aoa in the studied full scale wwtp aoa unexpectedly dominated the aom community while coexisting with additional comammox and aob in the low intensity aeration dod of a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate the relatively high bioavailable copper input from the influent wastewater may have been a necessary prerequisite for meeting the copper demands of aoa the low oxygen levels do 1 5 mg l experienced in the dod was likely too low for aob and too high for comammox to dominate providing aoa a competitive advantage long retention times 25 30 days srt and 3 6 days hrt likely provided aoa an additional competitive advantage over aob while the relatively high levels of ammonium input provided aoa an additional competitive advantage over the oligotrophic comammox as expected amo genes essential for ammonia oxidization were among the most highly transcribed genes in all three aoa and the ammonia oxidizing potential of aoa in an activated sludge sample was verified through laboratory experiments observed patterns of gene transcription suggested that two of the aoa ws192 and ws208 may utilize urea in addition to ammonia while ws9 may be more competitive for ammonia directly through the high expression of an ammonium transporter the survival of aoa in the complex dod is possibly enhanced by the presence of ppk2 group 3b nife hydrogenase and v type atpase associated with special energy conversions furthermore the dominant of the novel aoa ws9 is likely contributed by the unique functions multiple paps related to h2o2 detoxification and multiple genes involving exopolysaccharide synthesis overall the studied dod provides an interesting case study of archaea dominated ammonia oxidation in a full scale wwtp the concentration of copper oxygen and ammonium all appeared to be optimized for aoa success in this instance further studies should focus on the enrichment and physiological characterization of representatives of the novel aoa ws9 for example to provide insights on optimal wwtp configurations for efficient nitrification declaration of competing interest the authors

17211,recent studies indicate that ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa may play an important role in nitrogen removal by wastewater treatment plants wwtps however our knowledge of the mechanisms employed by aoa for growth and survival in full scale wwtps is still limited here metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with a laboratory cultivation experiment revealed that three active aoas ws9 ws192 and ws208 belonging to family nitrososphaeraceae were active in the deep oxidation ditch dod of a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate which is configured with three continuous aerobic anoxic oa modules with low intensity aeration 1 5 mg l aoa coexisted with aob and complete ammonia oxidizers comammox while the ammonia oxidizing microbial aom community was unexpectedly dominated by the novel aoa strain ws9 the low aeration long retention time and relatively high inputs of ammonium and copper might be responsible for the survival of aoa over aob and comammox while the dominance of ws9 specifically may be enhanced by substrate preference and uniquely encoded retention strategies the urease negative ws9 is specifically adapted for ammonia acquisition as evidenced by the high expression of an ammonium transporter whereas two metabolically versatile urease positive aoa strains ws192 and ws208 can likely supplement ammonia needs with urea this study provides important information for the survival and application of the eutrophic nitrososphaeraceae aoa and advances our understanding of archaea dominated ammonia oxidation in a full scale wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia oxidation nitrososphaeraceae aoa landfill leachate low aeration copper ions deep oxidation ditch 1 introduction ammonia oxidation to nitrite represents the first and rate limiting step in nitrification and is a crucial process linking mineralization to nitrogen loss processes it was long understood to be performed exclusively by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob which are affiliated with beta and gamma proteobacteria purkhold et al 2000 but this changed significantly after the isolation of an ammonia oxidizing archaeon aoa nitrosopumilus maritimus könneke et al 2005 archaeal ammonia monooxygenase amo encoded by all studied aoa catalyzes aerobic ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine vajrala et al 2013 the first step of nitrification but the enzyme responsible for the second step to nitrite production is presumed to be an unidentified archaeal hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and the contributing cofactors also remain unknown vajrala et al 2013 walker et al 2010 it has been repeatedly proposed that a multicopper oxidase could be the archaeal hao santoro et al 2015 walker et al 2010 molecular surveys of diagnostic genes such as the ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa and 16s rrna genes have detected aoa in nearly every niche on the earth alves et al 2018 suggesting that aoa play a critical role in global nitrogen cycling aoa are generally considered to be highly specialized chemolithoautotrophs that acquire energy from ammonia oxidation and use co2 as the sole carbon source kim et al 2016 but this perception has been challenged by several studies suggesting that aoa are metabolically flexible in some cases alternative substrates provide the necessary ammonia and carbon dioxide for growth for example aoa can convert urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide jung et al 2016 kitzinger et al 2018 qin et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 a process that is particularly important in acidic soils lu et al 2012 cyanate was also identified as a source of ammonia and carbon dioxide for aerobic growth of the moderately thermophilic aoa nitrososphaeragargensis palatinszky et al 2015 and some marine aoa kitzinger et al 2018 however other evidence points to substrates other than ammonia it has been reported that an amoa carrying thaumarchaeota in a wwtp showed no incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate or oxidation of ammonia but was instead proposed to use alternative energy and carbon sources mußmann et al 2011 other reports suggest that the response of aoa may be linked to the mineralization of soil organic matter rather than with specific nitrogen substrates in alkaline soil tzanakakis et al 2018 and acidic soil stopnišek et al 2010 however observed stimulatory effects of organic substrates ie α ketoic acids on archaeal ammonia oxidation qin et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 were recently demonstrated to be linked to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species especially h2o2 via a nonenzymatic decarboxylation reaction rather than to mixotrophy kim et al 2016 qin et al 2017b at this time the physiological versatility of aoa is not clearly understood whether aoa are indeed metabolically flexible is an open question a growing body of literature is focused on understanding which environmental conditions favor aoa over aob it is well understood that aoa can outnumber their bacterial counterparts in oligotrophic ecosystems by several orders of magnitude this is true in marine systems horak et al 2013 radax et al 2012 ammonium depleted soils leininger et al 2006 acidic soils zhang et al 2012 arctic soils alves et al 2013 hot springs chen et al 2016 weidler et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 and hydrothermal vents wang et al 2009 these oligotrophic aoa are believed to possess a higher affinity for ammonia than aob kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 prosser and nicol 2012 straka et al 2019 in contrast aob are understood to dominate ammonia oxidizing communities in eutrophic environments such as most wastewater treatment systems most likely due to their copiotrophic growth characteristics gao et al 2013 verhamme et al 2011 wells et al 2009 this dichotomy has been challenged more recently like aob nitrososphaeraceae aoa possess copiotrophic growth characteristics and can tolerate higher ammonia concentrations than other thaumarcheal isolates jung et al 2016 lehtovirta morley et al 2016 tourna et al 2011 furthermore nitrososphaeraceae aoa outnumber aob in some eutrophic wwtps bai et al 2012 mußmann et al 2011 pan et al 2018 pornkulwat et al 2018 roy et al 2017 sauder et al 2012 and may also outcompete aob in some hypoxic reactors lian et al 2014 park et al 2006 kinetic respirometry assays have confirmed that aoa can have a much higher affinity for oxygen than aob jung et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 park et al 2010 straka et al 2019 and that dissolved oxygen do concentration appears to be an important determinant for the success of aoa in eutrophic wastewater treatment systems it was reported that marine aoa available in pure culture could sustain high ammonia oxidation activity at low oxygen concentrations 10 µm qin et al 2017b low oxygen levels caused the preferential enrichment of marine ca nitrosopumilus maritimus over aob in laboratory reactor it has been shown that aoa in wwtps prefer low do aerated anoxic conditions park et al 2006 and are inhibited by high do concentrations chen et al 2017 in addition to do copper availability has been identified as important for the success of aoa because copper ions are essential for numerous copper dependent enzymes associated with ammonia oxidation electron transfer and other physiological functions beaumont et al 2004 carini et al 2018 gwak et al 2020 lieberman and rosenzweig 2005 one explanation for the general lack of aoa in wwtp may arise from the copper limitation of archaeal nitrification which occurs in municipal wwtps through the sequestration of copper by organic compounds and may be alleviated by copper supplementation gwak et al 2020 ammonia oxidation efficiency in biological rapid sand filters for drinking water production was significantly affected by copper availability wagner et al 2016 aoa have been recognized to be the primary nitrifiers in the marine environment but even there archaeal ammonia oxidation activity might be limited by the copper bioavailability of seawater amin et al 2013 although the occurrence of aoa in full scale wwtps has been widely reported our knowledge of the specific survival strategies contributing to the success of aoa in the complex wastewater treatment systems is still lacking in this study aoa were identified in the low intensity aeration deep oxidation ditch dod of a full scale wwtp archaeal ammonia oxidation activity was verified by a batch cultivation environmental conditions that favor the survival of aoa were investigated and the ecological flexibilities of aoa were probed through metatranscriptomics and comparative genomics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection sequencing and data analysis activated sludge was collected from the nitrifying deep oxidation ditch dod of wenshan ws wwtp in taipei taichung on 25th dec 2015 table 1 approximately 150 200 m3 day of wastewater were fed into the wwtp a mixture of car wash wastewater landfill leachate and supernatant from kitchen waste compost the dod was operated with a solids retention time srt and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 25 30 and 3 6 days respectively table 1 the dod is configured as three sequential aerobic anoxic oa modules wastewater is aerated at the beginning of each module with a relatively low intensity of aeration do concentration 1 5 mg l fig 1 a sludge samples were collected at the end of the second oa module where low do concentrations 0 07 mg l were observed table 1 and fig 1a influent and effluent wastewaters of the dod were collected once a day over a one month period before the time of sampling for the measurement of ammonium nitrate and bod table 1 the concentration of copper in the influent wastewater was measured once a month for one year prior to collecting sludge table 1 the real time physicochemical data of the sampling site including ammonium concentration temperature oxidation reduction potential orp and do were measured when sampling table 1 three independent activated sludge samples technical replicates were collected from the dod and samples for dna isolation were stored at 20 c while samples for rna isolation were preserved on site in life guard soil preservation solution qiagen germany details of sampling nucleic acids extraction cdna synthesis sequencing as well as de novo metagenomic assembly binning and quality assessment have been described in a previous study yang et al 2020b briefly total dna and rna were extracted from each replicate sample and the dna or rna respectively extracted from each sample was pooled rna was converted to double stranded cdna the acquired dna and cdna were used for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing respectively the filtered and trimmed metagenomic datasets were assembled de novo using idba ud v1 1 1 peng et al 2012 with the following parameters mink 65 maxk 145 step 8 and resulting scaffolds were binned using maxbin with the setting min contig length 2500 wu et al 2014 finally in total 337 mags including three aoa mags ws9 ws192 and ws208 two aob mags ws89 and ws186 two comammox mags ws110 and ws238 and two nob mags ws74 and ws250 were obtained the completeness and contamination level of the acquired mags were estimated using checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 short metagenomic reads were mapped to mags by bowtie2 v2 2 9 ben and steven 2012 with the default settings to calculate the abundances of genomes as rpkm robinson and oshlack 2010 the relative abundances of all nitrifiers were calculated based on their genome abundances against the total genome abundance of all the obtained mags in the dod system the rrna reads were identified and removed from metatranscriptomic datasets using ribopicker schmieder et al 2012 non rrna metatranscriptomic reads were mapped to the predicted genes by bwa v0 7 17 li and durbin 2009 with the default settings to calculate the gene transcript as rpkm rpkm number of mapped reads gene length 1 000 total mapped reads 1 000 000 2 2 aerobic ammonia oxidation activity of aoa fresh activated sludge suspension was inoculated 10 v v into a modified ammonia oxidizing microbial aom medium lebedeva et al 2013 with 0 5 mm nh4cl and incubated aerobically at 28 c statically the medium was amended with allylthiourea atu 20 μm and chlorate 50 μm an antibiotic mixture of ampicillin and penicillin g each at 50 μg ml to selectively inhibit the growth of aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and other bacteria respectively jung et al 2014 jung et al 2011 the ph of the medium was maintained around 7 6 by a nahco3 buffering system during culturing and incubation the concentrations of nh4 no2 and no3 were measured every other day before the amended nh4 was fully oxidized the concentration of nh4 hood nowotny et al 2010 kandeler and gerber 1988 no2 and no3 miranda et al 2001 was measured spectrophotometrically the batch culturing was carried out in three technical replicates 2 3 genome annotation aoa mags acquired from the metagenomic dataset were annotated by ghostkoala which is kegg s internal annotation tool for k number assignment of kegg genes using ssearch computation kanehisa et al 2016 besides predicted orfs were also annotated by eggnog mapper v5 0 huerta cepas et al 2017 and rapid annotation using subsystem technology rast v2 0 overbeek et al 2014 predicted orfs were also searched against the ncbi non redundant nr by blastp using an e value 10 10 as threshold with the setting max target seqs 3 to acquire more annotation 2 4 phylogenetic analysis checkm v1 0 6 parks et al 2015 was used to produce an alignment of 43 concatenated markers from the three newly acquired mags as well as previously published aoa genomes completeness 50 contamination 10 table s1 available at the end of december 2018 to produce a dataset for a 16s rrna phylogeny the 16s rrna gene sequences of the three newly acquired mags were used as queries in blastn searches against the ncbi nt database the top 100 hits for each were downloaded and clustered by usearch cluster fast https drive5 com usearch manual cmd cluster fast html with an identity of 97 the cluster representatives of downloaded 16s rrna gene sequences were appended to the 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from aoa genomes sequences of amoa were extracted from all known aoa genomes for phylogenetic analysis 16s rrna gene and amoa sequences were aligned with mafft v7 427 yamada et al 2016 and gaps in alignment were removed using trimal v1 2 with the setting gt 0 1 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 maximum likelihood trees of the concatenated marker alignment amoa and 16s rrna gene were constructed using iq tree v1 6 2 with models of lg f r10 lg r3 and tim3 f r2 chosen by model finder of iq tree respectively nguyen et al 2015 putative nife hydrogenases identified in aoa genomes were classified by the hyddb online server https services birc au dk hyddb søndergaard et al 2016 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of group 3b nife hydrogenase sequences identified in aoa genomes was built as described above using the model lg f r8 with reference sequences downloaded from hyddb annotated a subunits of aoa atpases were downloaded from ncbi nr and used to build a custom blastp database additional a subunits of aoa atpase were identified by blastp searches against the custom database with an identity cutoff of 40 and alignment length 50 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the identified a subunits of aoa atpase was built as described above using the model lg r4 annotated purple acid phosphatase sequences were downloaded from ncbi and uniprotkb downloaded sequences were clustered by usearch cluster fast with an identity of 85 to build a custom dataset a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of purple acid phosphatases identified in aoa genomes and the custom dataset of purple acid phosphatases was built as described above using the model vt r9 all phylogenetic trees were visualized using itol letunic and bork 2019 2 5 comparative genomic analyses three aoa mags of interest were compared to known genomes of the nitrososphaeraceae aoa and 13 additional closed genomes of aoa in terms of average nucleotide identity ani using orthoani lee et al 2016 and evaluated with a species level cutoff of 95 goris et al 2007 average amino acid identity aai was calculated using the aai calculator rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 and genus level taxonomy was inferred using a cutoff of 60 80 konstantinidis et al 2017 luo et al 2014 unique genes in the three mags were identified by filtering reciprocal best blast hits altschul et al 1990 for e value 10 5 amino acid identities 40 and a minimum alignment length 50 as identification criteria for unique genes reciprocal best blast results were visualized using circlize in r gu et al 2014 the distribution of specific genes in aoa genomes was investigated by building custom databases specific gene sequences in closed genomes were downloaded from ncbi and jgi according to annotated functions manually annotated swiss prot sequences were downloaded from uniprot and merged into the above corresponding sequence pools and custom blast databases were built with the makeblastdb tool of ncbi predicted orfs from the three newly acquired mags and 26 high quality aoa genomes completeness 90 contamination 5 table s1 were searched by blastp against these functional gene databases with e value 10 5 amino acid identity 40 and minimum alignment length 50 2 6 data availability raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences can be found on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under bioproject prjna406858 these three mags ws9 ws192 and ws208 reported in this study have been deposited under accession numbers of qcwd00000000 qcwc00000000 and qcwb00000000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonia oxidation by archaea in dod activated sludge observed nitrification activity of the dod was high as illustrated by the removal of approximately 95 of the influent ammonium and complete oxidation to nitrate of 50 of the consumed ammonium table 1 fresh activated sludge collected from the dod and treated with inhibitors of aob and nob completely oxidized 0 5 mm of nh4 to no2 within eight days in the three replicates ten fold dilution while the production of no3 was not detected fig 1b the ammonia oxidation activity could be attributed to aoa because the activities of aob and nob could be selectively inhibited by the atu 20 μm chlorate 50 μm and a mixture of antibiotics gwak et al 2020 jung et al 2014 3 2 recovery and classification of aoa mags from the dod shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on the activated sludge sample collected from the dod of ws plant produced a total of 517 2 million metagenomic reads and 364 8 million metatranscriptomic reads after removing rrna reads 47 3 million non rrna metatranscriptomic reads remained three aoa mags ws9 ws192 and ws208 were obtained from the metagenomic dataset ranging in size from 1 91 to 2 45 mb and in completeness from 90 9 to 96 1 table s1 phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated marker genes fig 2 amoa fig s1a and 16s rrna genes fig s1b placed ws192 and ws208 into the genera nitrosocosmicus and nitrososphaera respectively ws192 shared 82 4 ani and 84 9 aai with ca nitrosocosmicus exaquare g61 indicating that it represented a new species of nitrosocosmicus ws208 shared 73 5 ani and 80 0 aai with nitrososphaera viennensis en76 indicating that it represented a new species within nitrososphaera fig 3 a they were thus designated ca nitrosocosmicus sp ws192 and ca nitrososphaera sp ws208 the phylogenetic placement of ws9 was unresolved using 16s or amoa fig s1 but was resolved in the concatenated marker gene tree in which it diverged as a basal lineage prior to the divergence of nitrosocosmicus and nitrososphaera fig 2 ani aai and pairwise 16s rrna gene identities were used to further evaluate the taxonomic classification of ws9 the nearly full length 16s rrna gene sequence 1 400 bp was most similar 94 46 identity to the 16s rrna gene from the known aoa strains ca nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 and ca nitrosocosmicus exaquare g61 which was marginally lower than the proposed genus cutoff 94 5 yarza et al 2014 ws9 shared less than 95 ani with any other aoa fig 3a and shared the highest aai with nitrososphaera gargensis ga9 2 59 5 fig 3b which is lower than the genus cutoff 60 80 based on aai konstantinidis et al 2017 luo et al 2014 thus ws9 likely represents a new genus which we have tentatively named ca nitrosocaenobius wenshanensis ws9 3 3 aoa are active in the dod paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing provided the first holistic insights into the activities of aoa in the full scale wwtp in total 67 9 24 5 and 62 8 of all predicted orfs from ws9 ws192 and ws208 respectively were detected in the metatranscriptomic dataset fig 4 a a much larger number of metatranscriptomic reads mapped to ws9 and ws208 than to ws192 and genes classified into most kegg functional categories were detected fig 4a transcripts were detected for genes from all three mags encoding co2 fixation 3hp 4hb cycle respiratory chain complexes i ii iii iv and atpases fig 5 as expected genes encoding key enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation amoabcx were highly transcribed and among the most abundant transcripts fig 5 fig 4b consistent with previous studies carini et al 2018 hollibaugh et al 2011 qin et al 2017a nitrite reductase nirk was highly transcribed by ws192 and ws208 fig 4b but the transcriptional abundance of the nirk encoded by the relatively abundant ws9 was lower than the nirk encoded by ws192 and ws208 which are present in lower abundance fig 4b fig 5 3 4 co existence of ammonia oxidizers in the dod aoa cooccurred with comammox nitrospira aob nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira in the nitrifying dod fig s2 interestingly the novel aoa ws9 was the most abundant aom identified in metagenomic data fig 6 a fig s2 and had the highest bulk amoa transcription fig 6b despite previous reports that aob typically dominate the aom community in eutrophic wastewater treatment systems gao et al 2013 gao et al 2014 hink et al 2018 park et al 2006 in contrast another two aoa namely ws192 and ws208 were less abundant compared to other aom fig 6a ws208 appeared to participate in ammonia oxidation with high activity according to the high amoa transcription fig 6b the high activity but lowest genome abundance reflects ws208 may lack of capability to efficiently accumulate biomass in the flowing wastewater compare to ws9 and ws208 the weak amoa transcription likely indicates ws192 had relatively low ammonia oxidation activity fig 6b comammox and aob could compete with aoa for ammonia especially aob with a higher amoa transcription compared with comammox organisms fig 6b the oxidized nitrite by aom could be further oxidized to nitrate by nob and comammox whereas nob likely dominant this process because of the high nxra transcription fig 6b the amoa and nxra gene transcripts of comammox were much lower than canonical nitrifiers fig 6b that canonical nitrifiers likely are more important in the dod the low aeration of the dod 1 5 mg l table 1 may have provided aoa a competitive advantage compared to their bacterial counterparts aob several lines of evidence suggest that some aoa favor hypoxic conditions kinetic respirometry assays have shown that aoa have a much higher affinity for oxygen than those of aob jung et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 park et al 2010 straka et al 2019 and the optimum aeration level for the enrichment of a nitrososphaera strain was shown to be 2 03 mg l chen et al 2017 the dominance of nitrososphaeraceae aoa has been consistently observed in other hypoxic wastewater treatment systems lian et al 2014 park et al 2006 in addition to low do levels long retention times 15 days srt 24 h hrt were also found to facilitate the growth of aoa park et al 2006 the presence of genes encoding for flagella was suggested to contribute to the survival of ca nitrosotenuis cloacae in wwtps by promoting biofilm formation and extending the effective retention time li et al 2016 however flagella encoding genes were absent in all three of the newly obtained aoa mags suggesting that they lack this mechanism and that their dominance is likely dependent on the long retention times 25 30 days srt and 3 6 days hrt inherent to the studied dod table 1 comammox nitrospira mags were recently assembled from the same reactor yang et al 2020a with relatively high transcriptional activities fig 6a comammox nitrospira have been reported to be dominant members of the aom community in anaerobic reactors roots et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020a and have been successfully enriched from activated sludge by cycling between anoxic or anaerobic conditions and microaerobic conditions do 0 6 mg l camejo et al 2017 relative to these conditions the oxygen level in the aeration dod do 1 5 mg l table 1 is much higher which may have prevented comammox nitrospira from having a competitive advantage against aoa additionally the high ammonium levels of the dod 118 15 mg l might be more favourable for the growth of the eutrophic nitrososphaeraceae aoa jung et al 2016 than for comammox nitrospira which have a high affinity for ammonia kits et al 2017 and can be enriched under ammonia limited conditions fujitani et al 2020 although a relatively high transcriptional activity of comammox was detected in the dod fig 6a low biomass yield might limit the abundance of comammox kits et al 2017 copper is necessary for both aoa and aob due to their physiological dependence on enzymes such as amo and copper dependent nirk which contain mono and di nuclear copper centers beaumont et al 2004 carini et al 2018 lieberman and rosenzweig 2005 aob also depend on iron fe containing metalloenzymes and proteins forelectron transfer while aoa appear to be more dependent on copper to act as a co factor in enzymes involved in their electron transfer systems gwak et al 2020 ammonia oxidation efficiency was significantly affected by copper availability in drinking water treatment systems and marine environments where aoa were the primary nitrifiers amin et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 the general lack of aoa in wwtp has been suggested to result from copper limitation on archaeal nitrification where high metal complexation potentials of organic compounds may significantly reduce copper bioavailability gwak et al 2020 although copper limitation of aoa has been observed at copper concentration levels below 1 17 10 7 mol l gwak et al 2020 higher copper levels in the studied dod 1 56 10 7 1 72 10 6 mol l table 1 may indicate a lack of copper limitation for this system although oxygen ammonia and copper concentrations appear to contribute to the high abundance of aoa in the studied dod the abundance of an organism does not always reflect its contribution to an environmental process for example oceanic ammonia and nitrite oxidation are balanced despite nob have a ten fold lower abundance than aoa in the ocean kitzinger et al 2020 thus follow up research that quantifies the actual contributions to nitrification by aoa and other nitrifiers especially the high activity but low biomass yield comammox is needed 3 5 substrate competition strategies of aoa urease enables aoa to use urea as an additional ammonia source jung et al 2016 kitzinger et al 2018 qin et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 and nitrification activity of aoa in acidic soil is primarily supported by urea lu et al 2012 urease and urea transporters were encoded and expressed by ws192 and ws208 fig 4b fig 5 all known nitrososphaeraceae aoa encode the urease except for ws9 fig s3 suggesting that ws9 may harbor a unique strategy for substrate acquisition all three aoa encoded one ammonium transporter amt1 which has been proposed to be a low affinity and high capacity transporter nakagawa and stahl 2013 rutherford et al 2008 fig s3 the high expression of amt1 by the urease negative ws9 fig 4b may provide an advantage for sequestering ammonium providing it a growth advantage in the high ammonium conditions of the dod there are other reports of aoa that utilize ionized ammonium nh4 as a substrate nh4 was deduced to be the substrate of an acidophilic aoa ca nitrosotalea devanaterra ndev1 under acidic conditions ph 5 5 at which nh3 pk a 9 3 availability is reduced by ionization lehtovirta morley et al 2011 simulations of nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 showed that charged surface layers s layers may elevate the concentration of nh4 in the pseudo periplasmic space and facilitate the uptake of nh4 as a substrate li et al 2018 however it is still unclear nh4 collection by amt in aoa is related to energy generation or only required for nitrogen assimilation 3 6 special functions of aoa in energy conversion polyphosphate kinase 2 ppk2 was encoded by ws9 and all known nitrosocosmicus fig s3 ppk2 is an enzyme catalyzing adp and atp synthesis using amp and polyphosphate as substrates motomura et al 2014 nocek et al 2008 which enables the use of polyphosphate as an intracellular energy reserve for the generation of atp and survival moreover ppk2 can catalyze polyphosphate driven nucleotide phosphorylation to maintain intracellular nucleotide pools which may allow aoa to respond to changes in nutrient concentrations and osmotic stress gangaiah et al 2010 sureka et al 2009 a putative group 3b nife hydrogenase as well as the factors required for hydrogenase maturation were encoded by ws9 and ws208 these hydrogenases form a phylogenetic clade with hydrogenases from the euryarchaeon aciduliprofundum bootstrap 85 and are distantly related to the homologous hydrogenases found in ca nitrosocaldus the only other aoa to encode these genes abby et al 2018 daebeler et al 2018 fig s3 fig 8a group 3b hydrogenases are distributed across phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea greening et al 2016 and may couple nad p h oxidation to the evolution of h2 berney et al 2014 at the temperature in the dod 20 c this reaction would be highly inefficient and could proceed only at a low partial pressure of h2 around 10 3 to 10 4 bar schink 1997 however 3b hydrogenases may also be reversible oxidizing h2 with nad p as the electron acceptor berney et al 2014 bryant and adams 1989 greening et al 2016 the expression of group 3b nife hydrogenases from aoa fig 5 may then indicate that growth and or maintenance of aoa in the complex wastewater treatment system could be supplemented by hydrogen oxidation ws9 and ws192 contained a nine subunit v type atpase specific to acidophilic acid tolerant aoa fig s5 wang et al 2019 all nine subunits of this atpase were identified in ws9 but subunit k was missing in ws192 table s2 ws208 instead encoded the eight subunit a type atpase found in neutrophilic aoa wang et al 2019 fig s5 table s2 all genes encoding the identified subunits of a type and v type atpases were transcribed fig 5 the expression of v type atpases may enhance the ability of ws9 and ws192 to maintain intracellular ph under acidic conditions ph 5 5 ca nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 was shown to transcribe the v type atpase encoding genes which was taken as evidence that the function of the v type atpase is related to ph homeostasis in aoa wang et al 2019 3 7 the unique survival strategies of the dominant aoa ws9 contained 833 genes that were absent from ws192 and ws208 fig 7 most of which could not be assigned a function the genes for which functional annotations could be assigned provided insight on why ws9 may be the most abundant aoa in the system up to six copies of putative purple acid phosphatases paps were uniquely encoded and expressed by ws9 fig 7 including four extracellular phosphatases and two intracellular phosphatases table s2 the presence of multiple paps in the catalase negative ws9 may be indicative of a diverse set of tools that fulfill a critical role in h2o2 detoxification fig s3 paps have been identified in numerous plants mammals and fungi but they are rarely found in prokaryotes schenk et al 2000a schenk et al 2013 homology models suggest that prokaryotic paps should play an important role in the removal of reactive oxygen intermediates through a fenton type reaction schenk et al 2000b the paps derived from ws9 formed a separate phylogenetic clade with a putative pap from an uncultured marine thaumarchaeote fig 8 b genes involving exopolysaccharide synthesis were examined in the three aoa mags active exopolysaccharide synthesis pathways are thought to be associated with cell aggregation and biofilm formation for specific survival advantages in ca nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 a nitrososphaeraceae aoa strain jung et al 2016 exopolysaccharide allows cells to adhere to each other or onto a surface for physical stresses resistance limoli et al 2015 and substrate acquisition jung et al 2016 which may significantly promote biomass accumulation in the flowing wastewater by ensuring that cells are not completely washed away several transcriptionally active genes with a potential role in exopolysaccharide synthesis were identified in ws9 a putative oligosaccharide flippase pglk involved in lipid linked oligosaccharide translocation and an adjacent glycosyltransferase were unique to ws9 and detected in metatranscriptomic data fig 7 fig s4 in bacteria lipid linked oligosaccharide translocation is usually associated with exopolysaccharide synthesis cell wall construction and n linked protein glycosylation hong et al 2018 perez et al 2015 genes encoding udp n acetyl d glucosamine 6 dehydrogenase cdp alcohol phosphatidyltransferase and three glycosyltransferases involved in oligosaccharideand lipid synthesis were found in the gene neighborhood of the oligosaccharide flippase and were transcriptionally active burrows et al 2000 lairson et al 2008 nogly et al 2014 fig 7 fig s4 additional transcriptionally active exopolysaccharide synthesis genes unique to ws9 were found as a separate gene cluster fig 7 fig s4 this cluster of genes included a glycosyltransferase a putative exported protein and gdp mannose dehydrogenase gmd which isinvolved in the production of an alginate precursor gdp mannuronic acid remminghorst and rehm 2006 putative glycosyltransferase encoding genes were also found in ws192 and ws208 but the adjacent oligosaccharides and lipids syntheses as well as translocation related genes were lacking 5 conclusion and implications paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing provided the first holistic insights into possible niche specialization of aoa in the studied full scale wwtp aoa unexpectedly dominated the aom community while coexisting with additional comammox and aob in the low intensity aeration dod of a full scale wwtp treating landfill leachate the relatively high bioavailable copper input from the influent wastewater may have been a necessary prerequisite for meeting the copper demands of aoa the low oxygen levels do 1 5 mg l experienced in the dod was likely too low for aob and too high for comammox to dominate providing aoa a competitive advantage long retention times 25 30 days srt and 3 6 days hrt likely provided aoa an additional competitive advantage over aob while the relatively high levels of ammonium input provided aoa an additional competitive advantage over the oligotrophic comammox as expected amo genes essential for ammonia oxidization were among the most highly transcribed genes in all three aoa and the ammonia oxidizing potential of aoa in an activated sludge sample was verified through laboratory experiments observed patterns of gene transcription suggested that two of the aoa ws192 and ws208 may utilize urea in addition to ammonia while ws9 may be more competitive for ammonia directly through the high expression of an ammonium transporter the survival of aoa in the complex dod is possibly enhanced by the presence of ppk2 group 3b nife hydrogenase and v type atpase associated with special energy conversions furthermore the dominant of the novel aoa ws9 is likely contributed by the unique functions multiple paps related to h2o2 detoxification and multiple genes involving exopolysaccharide synthesis overall the studied dod provides an interesting case study of archaea dominated ammonia oxidation in a full scale wwtp the concentration of copper oxygen and ammonium all appeared to be optimized for aoa success in this instance further studies should focus on the enrichment and physiological characterization of representatives of the novel aoa ws9 for example to provide insights on optimal wwtp configurations for efficient nitrification declaration of competing interest the authors

17212,this study evaluates 9 biocides as disinfectants against microbiological contaminants specifically microalgae and e coli while assessing their safety and environmental impact specifically the biocide effectiveness and corresponding generation of halogenated compounds is assessed in a real contaminated groundwater receiving acidic leachate from a phosphogypsum landfill oxidizing agents are investigated namely hypochlorite peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide and persulfate together with electrophilic biocides namely 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanoacetamide and chloro methylisothiazolinone in addition a novel disinfection approach is assessed by applying reducing agents namely sulfite and metabisulfite the disinfection mechanism and the formation of halogenated compounds are discussed on the basis of the mode of action and of the molecular structure of each biocide overall the results show that an optimal dosage of the biocides exists to minimize the formation of harmful compounds in water while maximizing disinfection especially for hypochlorite and peracetic acid this dosage was between 0 03 mm and 0 15 mm depending on the biocide the safety of electrophilic biocides is found to be associated to their molecular structure rather than their mode of action hydrogen peroxide mit and metabisulfite are the most promising disinfectants in the contaminated groundwater matrix of interest since no halogenated by products are detected upon successful disinfection while they are able to completely inactivate bacteria and remove over the 80 of microalgae in the selected matrix in particular metabisulfite represents a highly promising biocide owing to its low environmental and health impacts as well as economic feasibility estimated reagent

introduction the european union defines biocides as substances intended to destroy deter render harmless prevent the action of or otherwise exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism eu 1998 despite the potential risks for humans and for the environment biocides are deployed in a variety of activities including sanitation the textile industries and water treatment holah et al 2002 rutala and weber 2004 stewart et al 2001 windler et al 2013 within the water treatment industry they are usually applied as individual reagents with antifouling and disinfection purposes fujioka et al 2020 griebe and flemming 1998 maillard 2005 however disinfection processes based on biocide addition may lead to the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps such as halogenated compounds e g trihalomethanes thms which are often known or suspected carcinogenic compounds jones et al 2012 richardson et al 2007 shah et al 2015 therefore the correct application and management of biocides is crucial for the implementation of safe water technologies well established solutions include processes like ozonation ozone must be produced in situ and it is thus associated with higher operational costs also it can generate bromate a carcinogenic dbp in the presence of bromide shah et al 2015 the other commonly employed biocides have each advantages and disadvantages for example owing to its optimum cost efficiency ratio hypochlorite represents one of the most applied bactericidal compounds fukuzaki 2006 nevertheless clo leads to the formation of thms and it is an irritant for the mucous membranes when concentrated in water fukuzaki 2006 gómez lópez et al 2013 lee and huang 2019 promising alternatives were developed during the last decade among which chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid are the most successful examples even if these two compounds are effective biocides against a wide spectrum of microorganisms recent studies demonstrated that the former can generate chlorite and chlorate both harmful dbps together with traces of tribromomethane while the latter represents a potential source of thms in the presence of bromide and nom in water al otoum et al 2016 domínguez henao et al 2018 stevens 1982 xue et al 2017 yang et al 2013 all the above mentioned compounds rely on oxidative processes in order to attain disinfection other compounds can work as biocides through different mechanisms for example the couple methylisothiazolinone chloro methylisothiazolinone mit as well the 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanoacetamide dbnpa kahrilas et al 2015 nevertheless the literature lacks studies related to these compounds and to the formation of dbps once they are used for disinfection of contaminated water streams in addition to the compounds discussed so far reductants may find an application in water disinfection for instance they can potentially affect the photosynthetic mechanism thus limiting the growth of algae species beekley and hoffman 1981 shimazaki and sugahara 1979 wodzinski et al 1978 yang et al 2004 reducing agents include sulfuric compounds such as sulfur dioxide bisulfite and sulfite the ability of sulfites to inhibit the growth of some bacterial groups has been reported irwin et al 2017 in particular sulfites are promising compounds for industrial applications owing to their ease of storage safety they are not as explosive as oxidants lack of toxicity for humans and the environment and low capital and operational costs farinelli et al 2019 finding an inexpensive and easy to deploy biocide which concurrently is effective eco friendly and does not contribute to dbps generation is a challenging task this is especially true in the treatment of complex water and wastewater streams such as those laden with organic materials and dissolved solids relevant examples of such effluents are landfill leachate and mine drainage for example the leachate of phosphogypsum landfills create an acidic environment rich of phosphate nutrients and halides chernysh et al 2018 acidophilic microalgae can easily adapt and grow in this environment gross 2000 hirooka et al 2017 although acidic conditions generally kill bacteria gut et al 2006 observed that a significant salt concentration in the water matrix chloride content in particular plays a key role in the activity of proton membrane pumps that allows the survival of bacteria moreover jordan et al 1999 de jonge et al 2003 showed that some escherichia coli e coli sub populations can reach physiological equilibrium even at ph values as low as 2 3 the possible presence of different microorganisms and the complexity of such matrix make this type of contaminated water a perfect target for an investigation aimed at the evaluation of traditional as well as innovative biocides in this work the disinfection effectiveness of different biocides is evaluated against both microalgae and e coli while their safety is assessed by quantifying the formation of harmful halogenated by products specifically 9 biocides acting through three different disinfection mechanisms are evaluated as potential reagents applied individually in wastewater treatment along with the most common biocides commercially available exploiting mainly oxidation a detailed discussion is reported for electrophilic biocides while a new disinfection route exploiting reducing agents is assessed for the first time in order to evaluate the applicability of the studied solutions the biocide behavior is evaluated in real groundwater contaminated with phosphogypsum landfill leachate a brief discussion of the disinfection mechanism is provided for each biocide with the goal to help the interpretation of the biocidal action and the consequent formation of halogenated compounds in the target water matrix finally the most promising biocides are evaluated in terms of environmental impacts and cost of application 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and water matrices used in the study the biocides investigated in this study were i oxidants namely hypochlorite hclo peracetic acid paa chlorine dioxide clo2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfate k2s2o8 ii electrophilic namely dbnpa and mit iii reductants specifically sulfite and metabisulfite all the chemicals were used as received except for chlorine dioxide which was purchased from apura srl brescia italy all the other compounds were purchased from sigma aldrich milano italy mit was prepared by mixing methylisothiazolinone and chloro methylisothiazolinone at the appropriate concentration in an aqueous solution in a volume ratio of 1 to 3 for disinfection and dbp generation experiments individual biocides were dosed at the target concentrations vide infra in 15 ml of water samples all the water chemistry analyses were performed at a private external laboratory natura srl naples italy using methods epa 5030 c 2003 and epa 8260 d 2018 groundwater receiving leachate from a phosphogypsum landfill was directly obtained from the pumping wells in a contaminated site in the south of italy and used as is the main characteristics of the contaminated groundwater are summarized in table 1 a significant concentration of microalgae is present and an intermediate level of organic matter the contaminated water did not contain trihalomethanes or other halogenated organic compounds at detectable concentrations disinfection of this wastewater is required as a first stage in the existing treatment train to protect and enhance the subsequent coagulation process accomplished through addition of polyelectrolytes ferric chloride and calcium hydroxide for the removal of a large part of heavy metals radionuclides phosphate sulfate and fluoride cui et al 2020 liang et al 2009 liu et al 2019 nielson and smith 2005 a second disinfection phase is then present to reduce fouling and biofouling in the following ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis filtrations aimed at final effluent desalination fujioka et al 2020 griebe and flemming 1998 kim et al 2009 2 2 microalgae sampling and counting samples for microalgae quantification were collected in real water samples before disinfection and 2 h after the addition of each disinfectant to quantify the algae concentration a counting chamber was employed paul marienfield gmbh co lauda königshofen germany the chamber is equipped with an optical microscope renishaw uk the concentration of algae cells suspended in the samples was determined by multiplying the average number of cells observed in the microscope images by the relevant area the chamber depth and the dilution factor the nominal statistical error of the counting chamber is defined according to the formula error 1 n where n is the number of counted microalgae cells in the counting of the initial concentration of microalgae the nominal error was roughly 1 4 when only a few cells are counted in the chamber the error is of the same order of magnitude of the measured value therefore for values of the removal efficiency equal or larger than 90 its absolute value is no longer relevant and the disinfection should be considered nearly complete in all the other cases the nominal error was below 10 2 3 bacteria related methods lb saline solution and bacterial suspension preparation luria bertani lb broth was prepared by completely dissolving tryptone 10 g yeast extract 5 g and sodium chloride 10 g in 1 l of deionized water a slightly hypertonic saline medium was also prepared by dissolving sodium chloride 8 g and potassium chloride 0 8 g in 1 l of deionized water the ph of this solution was adjusted to a value between 7 and 7 5 with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl before use the lb and saline mixtures were autoclaved for 15 min at 15 psi at a temperature of 121 c to prepare the bacterial suspension a volume of 5 ml lb was pipetted into a 15 ml falcon tube the e coli strain was a wild type isolate from urban secondary wastewater obtained by isolation and selection of the microorganism on selective growth media the e coli bacterial inoculum was made from a pre prepared master plate a colony was dispersed in 5 ml lb by mixing in a vortex machine for 30 s following this step the falcon tube was placed in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 c for 8 h under gentle agitation by circular motion subsequently 2 5 ml of the suspension was diluted in 250 ml of lb and left for 15 h in the incubator to achieve stationary growth phase 3 5 5 5 od600 and a concentration of roughly 109 colony forming units cfu ml the detailed procedure of bacterial preparation and purification was published elsewhere giannakis et al 2013 2 4 determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of e coli and determination of bacterial disinfection kinetics by biocides the minimum inhibitory concentration mic is typically defined as the minimal concentration of an antimicrobial necessary to inhibit the growth of a target microorganism in this study we adapted the broth dilution assay for the determination of mic with e coli as target microorganism and with the biocides in question instead of antimicrobials used in common mic testing as a proxy of e coli concentration the optical density of the samples was considered measured by a spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength od600 mic is an intrinsic characteristic of each biocide and depends also on the type of bacteria used as an evaluation strain to determine this parameter for the different biocides investigated in this study a falcon tube was filled with a 7 8 108 cfu ml suspension of e coli in lb od600 1 0 1 each biocide was spiked in the suspension at the target concentration and the falcon tube was then incubated for 24 h at 37 c both positive and negative controls i e no biocide and no bacteria respectively were always performed to ensure that no contamination occurred the absorbance at 600 nm wavelength was then measured to determine the optical density followed by calibration with suspensions of known concentrations determined by plating and counting the presence of biocides can result to cell lysis oxidation and or overall reduction of the cellular materials that cause light absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer when the bacteria are intact there was a biocide concentration that caused significant reduction in the optical density to avoid underestimating mic we selected as mic the lowest biocide concentration that maintained optical density at a similar level to the initial spiking final od600 after 24 h 1 0 2 before a 50 decrease in optical density and conversion to a destructive concentration from further addition of the biocide in this manner we can assume that bacterial growth was surely arrested at the chosen mic level furthermore kinetics disinfection experiments were performed in real contaminated groundwater by addition of the various biocides an appropriate amount of lb e coli suspension was added to the matrix to obtain a concentration of bacteria of roughly 106 cfu ml the biocides were added individually to the matrix and samples were collected at regular intervals upon sampling serial dilutions were immediately made in saline medium and the resulting suspensions were spread onto agar plates after 1 day of incubation at 37 c the cfus were counted to determine the concentration of cultivable cells a concentration of biocides equal to 0 03 mm was chosen for kinetics disinfection tests this being the lowest value determined for the removal of microalgae from real groundwater samples vide infra the same disinfection experiments were also performed with metabisulfite and hydrogen peroxide at each respective mic vide infra for mic values determined by experiments 2 5 methodology of life cycle analysis lca the environmental burden from the production of 1 kg of the three most interesting biocides i e mit hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite vide infra were evaluated by life cycle analysis using openlca 1 10 software which incorporates the ecoinvent 3 5 database three different methodologies were employed to conduct the environmental assessments recipe cumulative energy demand ced and ipcc2013 in the case of recipe the environmental analysis was modeled on both the endpoints and the midpoints the latter presented as normalized values on the total impact the ced approach was applied to assess the required energy expressed as the primary energy demand while ipcc2013 analysis with a timeframe of 20 years was performed to assess the global warming potential of the production of the three biocides while hydrogen peroxide is present in the ecoinvent database the impacts of metabisulfite and mit were determined by modeling their most common synthesis approach for metabisulfite the reaction between so2 and naoh was considered while the protocol for mit production was based on literature reports taubert et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection targets and principal characteristics of the studied biocides before the analysis of the efficacy of each disinfectant we present a succinct summary of their main characteristics the mode of action of the 9 biocides investigated in this work is depicted in fig 1 and briefly summarized in table 2 together with each molecular structure hclo clo2 h2o2 and paa can penetrate the phospholipidic membrane through passive diffusion thus these biocides disinfect through an intracellular action by acting on enzymatic processes and by attacking the dna purine bases and the internal cytoplasmic membrane fukuzaki 2006 ghanbari et al 2021 giannakis et al 2016 kitis 2004 maillard 2002 ofori et al 2017 tutumi et al 1973 xia et al 2017 moreover hclo clo2 h2o2 and paa can also damage the outer cellular membrane feng et al 2020 fukuzaki 2006 kitis 2004 persulfate is active toward microorganism disinfection mostly if activated by transition metals wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 an estimation of the oxidation efficiency of an oxidant biocide can be estimated from a thermodynamic standpoint by comparing the redox potential of the reagent with that of bacteria strains the e coli redox potential is generally 0 45 to 0 72 v at ph 7 vs she ruales lonfat et al 2015 therefore all the biocides with a redox potential higher than 0 45 to 0 72 v at ph 7 will be able to damage e coli bacteria through oxidation the two electrophilic biocides namely dbnpa and mit disinfect by means of both extracellular and intracellular actions dbnpa is mostly active by damaging the external cellular membrane through an electrophilic addition to the nucleophilic groups of membrane proteins campa et al 2019 kahrilas et al 2015 mit is active also by inhibiting internal enzymatic processes kahrilas et al 2015 maillard 2002 williams 2006 literature lacks a detailed explanation on the disinfection mechanism of metabisulfite on the basis of previous reports and of its molecular structure it is reasonable to assume that metabisulfite can potentially alter the photosynthetic process of microalgae by releasing so2 in solution and that it can damage the cellular membrane in the same fashion of an electrophilic biocide beekley and hoffman 1981 shimazaki and sugahara 1979 wodzinski et al 1978 yaganza et al 2004 yang et al 2004 but its intracellular activity is still under debate a more exhaustive discussion of the mechanism of disinfection and dbps generation mode for each of the 9 biocides is provided in the supporting information si 3 2 disinfection efficacy as a first step to understand the capability of the various biocides to inactivate e coli bacteria we benchmarked their efficacy under the most unfavorable conditions by assessing their minimum inhibitory concentration mic with the main results summarized in fig 2 in fig 2a and 2b we present the optical density od600 as a proxy of bacterial concentration vs the biocide concentration a decrease in od600 indicates destruction of the cell hence for each biocide the mic was identified as the lowest concentration above which significant decrease in optical density was observed no mic value was found for sulfite in the biocide concentration range investigated in this study that is 0 10 mm and a high mic value 10 mm was found for persulfate therefore these compounds were not used for further investigation on disinfection against e coli the most effective biocides were mit dbnpa h2o2 and paa in this order as they required the lowest concentrations to inhibit bacterial growth fig 2c summarizes the mic values determined for all the biocides fig 3 a reports the values of microalgae removal percentage achieved by employing the different biocides at varying concentrations in the real groundwater samples consistent with the results observed with bacteria and presented in fig 2 sulfite and persulfate showed the lowest biocidal activity also towards microalgae indeed the activity of persulfate for both microbiological and chemical decontamination has been clearly shown only if this reagent is activated by transition metals boukari et al 2011 venieri et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 the literature instead lacks reports about the disinfection efficacy of sulfite in general no evident increase in algae removal rate was observed by increasing the concentration of biocides actually metabisulfite and sulfite showed a similar inverse trend of increasing disinfection efficacy by reducing the reagent concentration which suggests that these reagents may undergo suicidal self inhibition reactions at large concentrations furthermore mit showed the same inverse trend with concentration this compound is known to have a slow biocidal activity moreover it is highly susceptible to oxidation williams 2006 it is thus possible that at high concentration this biocide reacted faster with the oxygen freely present in the solution 0 3 mm than with the microbiological target overall it was found that the lowest concentration of 0 03 mm would allow near maximization of algae removal while minimizing the amount of required mit reagent several algae species such as chlorella adapt well in acidic environments gross 2000 hirooka et al 2017 on the contrary e coli cannot typically survive below ph 4 conner and kotrola 1995 the water matrix effect on e coli viability was investigated to understand this behavior and to isolate the effect of biocides from that of ph the results of e coli cultivability from the three blanks indicate that the acidity of the contaminated groundwater ph 2 8 is responsible for a significant bacterial inactivation within 2 h fig 3a therefore a biocide can only be considered effective toward bacteria disinfection in this matrix if it inactivates e coli faster than 2 h clearly metabisulfite and hydrogen peroxide were able to quickly inactivate e coli at their respective mic on the other hand metabisulfite was not as quickly effective at a low concentration of 0 03 mm fig 3c except also for hclo all the other biocides were instead able to inactivate bacteria at a fast rate even at this low dose which was also found to be the optimal concentration for microalgae removal as stated above fig 3a these data lead to an important conclusion when working with a complex water matrix such as that examined in this study each of the following biocide may be employed at low dose when only microalgae removal is required paa h2o2 clo2 dbnpa mit hclo and metabisulfite on the other hand in the presence of e coli or other persistent surviving bacteria behaving in a similar way the utilization of hclo and metabisulfite requires larger concentration to achieve both an effective algae removal and a suitable antibacterial activity 3 3 generation of disinfection by products the formation of disinfection by products was determined following addition of biocides in the real groundwater matrix as expected clo2 generated thms and in particular tribromomethane a carcinogenic compound at all the investigated concentrations the formation of this halogenated compound upon employment of clo2 is consistent with reports in the literature al otoum et al 2016 gómez lópez et al 2013 as expected also the use hclo and paa induced the formation of halogenated by products dell erba et al 2007 domínguez henao et al 2018 shah et al 2015 xue et al 2017 specifically at biocide concentrations of 15 1 5 and 0 15 mm see table 3 and si for the complete set of analysis tribromomethane was detected as the most prevalent dbp in particular in the case of paa the concentration of halogenated by products sharply increased with increasing disinfectant dose this behavior indicates the involvement of paa itself as a primary source in halogenated by products formation table 2 and si provide a more exhaustive discussion on the generation of dbps related to the nine biocides however thms or other halogenated compounds were not detected at concentrations of biocides equal to 0 075 or 0 03 mm even though both hclo and paa still maintained a suitable disinfectant efficiency therefore 0 075 mm represents the threshold safety related dose for hclo and paa application to the water matrix in examination these results suggest that it should be possible to find a threshold dose for any matrix at which adequate disinfection occurs without the detectable formation of halogenated compounds when employing of hclo and paa notably metabisulfite h2o2 mit sulfite and persulfate did not generate any trace of halogenated compounds even at the upper limits of the biocide concentration range the behavior of sulfite and persulfate may be merely ascribed to their low disinfection activity toward bacteria and algae which limited the formation of by products and prevented the formation of halogenated compounds ultimately we surmise that metabisulfite h2o2 and mit are the most interesting biocides of the study since they maintained high disinfection efficiency toward microorganisms without generating dbps another interesting result obtained in this study is the behavior of dbnpa and the formation of tribromomethane as a disinfection by product specifically the concentration of tribromomethane in water increased linearly with the dose of dbnpa see fig 4 a suggesting that this disinfectant itself is an important source of the related by product the formation of tribromomethane may be ascribed to the molecular structure of the biocide it is reasonable to consider the release of a 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanomethyl group after the nucleophilic acyl substitution between the thiol or aminic residues of the membrane proteins and the disinfectant see section on electrophilic biocides in the si campa et al 2019 kahrilas et al 2015 once in solution the cyano group can be replaced by a bromide present in the aqueous environment 6 4 ppm see table 1 thus forming the most stable by product that is tribromomethane fig 4b at 0 03 mm biocide concentration the formation of halogenated by products was not detected given the reaction mechanism of the disinfectant however it is reasonable to assume that 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanomethane was still released but in quantities that were too modest to react with the bromide and generate tribromomethane at detectable concentration it is interesting to note that mit belongs to the same biocide category of dbnpa i e electrophilic biocides but that its employment was not associated with the formation of halogenated by products fig 4a potentially by virtue of the different molecular structure of the two biocides 3 4 metabisulfite h2o2 and mit logistics of implementation metabisulfite h2o2 and mit resulted equally safe in terms of dbps generation but they are different in terms practical utilization e g storage safety indeed h2o2 and mit are well known in the literature as effective disinfectants giannakis et al 2016 kahrilas et al 2015 williams 2006 however they present some practical limitations compared to metabisulfite firstly the storage of large amounts of h2o2 is dangerous because of its explosive characteristics schreck et al 2004 besides the utilization of hydrogen peroxide is strongly discouraged before membrane desalination systems due to the possible degradation of the membrane when exposed to oxidizing agents da silva et al 2006 kang et al 2007 korolkov et al 2014 on the other hand mit is at both an allergenic and a cytotoxic compound burnett et al 2010 castanedo tardana and zug 2013 groot and weyland 1988 hannuksela 1986 metabisulfite although rarely studied for applications similar to that of this study may be the safest biocide overall also consistent with the hypothesis of its disinfection mechanism table 1 and fig 1 3 5 environmental impacts economic analysis and overall review of biocides a summary of the efficacy and dbps generation potential of the biocides used for the disinfection of leachate contaminated groundwater is reported in fig 5 a in this three dimensional plot a dot is associated with each biocide with the exclusion of persulfate and sulfite the values of mic microalgae removal rate at biocide concentration of 1 5 mm and average formation of halogenated compounds were considered to perform this summary analysis an ideal biocide that is both highly effective and does not induce the production of harmful dbps would sit in the top left corner of the graph chlorine based disinfectants are instead found on the right side of the graph because they are associated with the production of significant concentrations of harfmul dbps the safest biocides in this respect were mit hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite of these three h2o2 and especially mit were found to be highly effective against e coli i e low mic and slightly less so to remove microalgae a larger concentration of metabisulfite may instead be necessary to achieve the same disinfection efficacy of the other two biocides against both algae and bacteria on the basis of these observations the economic and environmental impacts associated with the use of mit hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite were evaluated wholesale cost of reagents was assumed and in particular 1200 400 and 200 ton for respectively mit 14 w w solution in water h2o2 50 v v solution in water and sodium metabisulfite 97 purity to calculate the cost of application to disinfect one cubic meter of contaminated groundwater concentrations of 0 03 mm 0 075 mm and 0 075 mm were considered in the effluent matrix for the three biocides respectively these values are based on the results presented in fig 3a and are thus associated with their effect against microalgae despite mit should be dosed at the lowest concentration the cost of its application would be the largest among the three biocides owing to its high market price see fig 5b the use of hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite would be economical 0 0025 m3 due to a combination of low price and medium concentration required in the matrix considering the environmental impacts of the three biocides mit is associated with the largest burdens mainly because this substance is toxic for the environment and for humans burnett et al 2010 de groot and herxheimer 1989 schnuch et al 1998 see also fig 5c and figure s1 in the si its production involves the reaction of five compounds namely acrylic acid hydrogen sulfide methanol methylamine and hydrogen chloride thus the exploitation of a large amount of environmental resources fig 5d shows the environmental impacts related to co2 emission which is the major parameter for climate change evaluations in lca analyses a more notable production of co2 is associated to the exploitation of mit this result can be rationalized considering the significant amount of energy required for the extraction processing and production of each of the compounds listed above and necessary for the synthesis of the final reagent the production of h2o2 also involves a relatively large amount of co2 release as it takes place through anthraquinone auto oxidation in addition the use of hydrogen peroxide poses problems of transport and storage because this substance is unstable and may cause fire or explosion on the contrary the application of metabisulfite is not associated to particularly high energy requirements or environmental impacts this result stems from the fact that the electrolytic process aimed at the production of naoh is well established while so2 is a waste element resulting from metal extraction processes and its reuse implies a gain in terms of life cycle another important consideration can be drawn from the results reported in fig 5d almost the totality of the energy supply currently derives from the exploitation of non renewable energy sources in case of mit and hydrogen peroxide production a reduction of the reliance on fossil fuels and a subsequent exploitation of more green energy sources would be strongly beneficial especially in the case of the application of these two biocides as it would result in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions 4 conclusion this study investigated the performance and safety of 9 different biocides hclo paa clo2 h2o2 persulfate dbnpa mit sulfite metabisulfite when employed for the abatement of algae and bacteria e coli in a complex aqueous solution specifically leachate from a phosphogypsum landfill overall the following conclusions can be drawn i various biocides are effective in the removal of algae in acidic wastewater including oxidizing compounds electrophilic biocides and reducing agents in particular algae disinfection rates larger than 80 were achieved even with a low addition 0 03 mm of hclo paa clo2 dbnpa mit or metabisulfite h2o2 required a dose of 0 075 mm to remove algae with a rate equal or larger than 80 ii mit and dbnpa were the most effective biocides against e coli while metabisulfite and hclo required higher dosage to achieve similarly high removal rates therefore no strong correlation between the removal rate against microalgae and against e coli was found in this study for the various biocides in terms of overall disinfection effectiveness the two electrophilic biocides showed the highest performance while addition of sulfite and persulfate as individual reagents had no or little effect iii due to the possible generation of harmful disinfection by products hclo and paa may not be employed for water disinfection with concentrations above a threshold value below this value likely specific for each water matrix these two biocides may represent effective and clean compounds for the abatement of algae and bacteria in the complex water matrix investigated in this study this threshold value was 0 075 mm iv the molecular structure of each biocide plays a key role in the disinfection process a chief example is represented by the different behavior of dbnpa and mit despite their analogous disinfection mechanisms they are both electrophilic biocides dbnpa induced the formation of tribromomethane during disinfection while mit acted as an effective biocide without generation of detectable levels of halogenated compounds v the most favorable biocides within the water matrix analyzed in this study considering simultaneously safety and effectiveness were mit h2o2 and metabisulfite vi in particular metabisulfite represents a highly promising new biocide due to its low cost low environmental impacts and adequate efficacy against both microalgae and bacteria while the effectiveness and disinfection byproduct generation of the biocides were investigated in a specific contaminated matrix the results of this study could be used as guidelines for the choice of the best biocide in different wastewaters oxidizing agents such as paa should not be employed in water matrices with large concentrations of halides especially bromide due to the consequent likely generation of halogenated compounds moreover this study indicates that an optimal biocide dose exists to maximize disinfection and safety therefore preliminary experiments should be performed to determine the correct biocide application in each matrix finally our results suggest that unconventional reagents may be applied effectively for the abatement of microorganisms such as microalgae and e coli within complex water sources in particular metabisulfite is a promising new disinfectant safer and more eco friendly than traditional biocides however further studies are required to understand its disinfection mechanism in detail declaration of competing

17212,this study evaluates 9 biocides as disinfectants against microbiological contaminants specifically microalgae and e coli while assessing their safety and environmental impact specifically the biocide effectiveness and corresponding generation of halogenated compounds is assessed in a real contaminated groundwater receiving acidic leachate from a phosphogypsum landfill oxidizing agents are investigated namely hypochlorite peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide and persulfate together with electrophilic biocides namely 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanoacetamide and chloro methylisothiazolinone in addition a novel disinfection approach is assessed by applying reducing agents namely sulfite and metabisulfite the disinfection mechanism and the formation of halogenated compounds are discussed on the basis of the mode of action and of the molecular structure of each biocide overall the results show that an optimal dosage of the biocides exists to minimize the formation of harmful compounds in water while maximizing disinfection especially for hypochlorite and peracetic acid this dosage was between 0 03 mm and 0 15 mm depending on the biocide the safety of electrophilic biocides is found to be associated to their molecular structure rather than their mode of action hydrogen peroxide mit and metabisulfite are the most promising disinfectants in the contaminated groundwater matrix of interest since no halogenated by products are detected upon successful disinfection while they are able to completely inactivate bacteria and remove over the 80 of microalgae in the selected matrix in particular metabisulfite represents a highly promising biocide owing to its low environmental and health impacts as well as economic feasibility estimated reagent

introduction the european union defines biocides as substances intended to destroy deter render harmless prevent the action of or otherwise exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism eu 1998 despite the potential risks for humans and for the environment biocides are deployed in a variety of activities including sanitation the textile industries and water treatment holah et al 2002 rutala and weber 2004 stewart et al 2001 windler et al 2013 within the water treatment industry they are usually applied as individual reagents with antifouling and disinfection purposes fujioka et al 2020 griebe and flemming 1998 maillard 2005 however disinfection processes based on biocide addition may lead to the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps such as halogenated compounds e g trihalomethanes thms which are often known or suspected carcinogenic compounds jones et al 2012 richardson et al 2007 shah et al 2015 therefore the correct application and management of biocides is crucial for the implementation of safe water technologies well established solutions include processes like ozonation ozone must be produced in situ and it is thus associated with higher operational costs also it can generate bromate a carcinogenic dbp in the presence of bromide shah et al 2015 the other commonly employed biocides have each advantages and disadvantages for example owing to its optimum cost efficiency ratio hypochlorite represents one of the most applied bactericidal compounds fukuzaki 2006 nevertheless clo leads to the formation of thms and it is an irritant for the mucous membranes when concentrated in water fukuzaki 2006 gómez lópez et al 2013 lee and huang 2019 promising alternatives were developed during the last decade among which chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid are the most successful examples even if these two compounds are effective biocides against a wide spectrum of microorganisms recent studies demonstrated that the former can generate chlorite and chlorate both harmful dbps together with traces of tribromomethane while the latter represents a potential source of thms in the presence of bromide and nom in water al otoum et al 2016 domínguez henao et al 2018 stevens 1982 xue et al 2017 yang et al 2013 all the above mentioned compounds rely on oxidative processes in order to attain disinfection other compounds can work as biocides through different mechanisms for example the couple methylisothiazolinone chloro methylisothiazolinone mit as well the 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanoacetamide dbnpa kahrilas et al 2015 nevertheless the literature lacks studies related to these compounds and to the formation of dbps once they are used for disinfection of contaminated water streams in addition to the compounds discussed so far reductants may find an application in water disinfection for instance they can potentially affect the photosynthetic mechanism thus limiting the growth of algae species beekley and hoffman 1981 shimazaki and sugahara 1979 wodzinski et al 1978 yang et al 2004 reducing agents include sulfuric compounds such as sulfur dioxide bisulfite and sulfite the ability of sulfites to inhibit the growth of some bacterial groups has been reported irwin et al 2017 in particular sulfites are promising compounds for industrial applications owing to their ease of storage safety they are not as explosive as oxidants lack of toxicity for humans and the environment and low capital and operational costs farinelli et al 2019 finding an inexpensive and easy to deploy biocide which concurrently is effective eco friendly and does not contribute to dbps generation is a challenging task this is especially true in the treatment of complex water and wastewater streams such as those laden with organic materials and dissolved solids relevant examples of such effluents are landfill leachate and mine drainage for example the leachate of phosphogypsum landfills create an acidic environment rich of phosphate nutrients and halides chernysh et al 2018 acidophilic microalgae can easily adapt and grow in this environment gross 2000 hirooka et al 2017 although acidic conditions generally kill bacteria gut et al 2006 observed that a significant salt concentration in the water matrix chloride content in particular plays a key role in the activity of proton membrane pumps that allows the survival of bacteria moreover jordan et al 1999 de jonge et al 2003 showed that some escherichia coli e coli sub populations can reach physiological equilibrium even at ph values as low as 2 3 the possible presence of different microorganisms and the complexity of such matrix make this type of contaminated water a perfect target for an investigation aimed at the evaluation of traditional as well as innovative biocides in this work the disinfection effectiveness of different biocides is evaluated against both microalgae and e coli while their safety is assessed by quantifying the formation of harmful halogenated by products specifically 9 biocides acting through three different disinfection mechanisms are evaluated as potential reagents applied individually in wastewater treatment along with the most common biocides commercially available exploiting mainly oxidation a detailed discussion is reported for electrophilic biocides while a new disinfection route exploiting reducing agents is assessed for the first time in order to evaluate the applicability of the studied solutions the biocide behavior is evaluated in real groundwater contaminated with phosphogypsum landfill leachate a brief discussion of the disinfection mechanism is provided for each biocide with the goal to help the interpretation of the biocidal action and the consequent formation of halogenated compounds in the target water matrix finally the most promising biocides are evaluated in terms of environmental impacts and cost of application 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and water matrices used in the study the biocides investigated in this study were i oxidants namely hypochlorite hclo peracetic acid paa chlorine dioxide clo2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfate k2s2o8 ii electrophilic namely dbnpa and mit iii reductants specifically sulfite and metabisulfite all the chemicals were used as received except for chlorine dioxide which was purchased from apura srl brescia italy all the other compounds were purchased from sigma aldrich milano italy mit was prepared by mixing methylisothiazolinone and chloro methylisothiazolinone at the appropriate concentration in an aqueous solution in a volume ratio of 1 to 3 for disinfection and dbp generation experiments individual biocides were dosed at the target concentrations vide infra in 15 ml of water samples all the water chemistry analyses were performed at a private external laboratory natura srl naples italy using methods epa 5030 c 2003 and epa 8260 d 2018 groundwater receiving leachate from a phosphogypsum landfill was directly obtained from the pumping wells in a contaminated site in the south of italy and used as is the main characteristics of the contaminated groundwater are summarized in table 1 a significant concentration of microalgae is present and an intermediate level of organic matter the contaminated water did not contain trihalomethanes or other halogenated organic compounds at detectable concentrations disinfection of this wastewater is required as a first stage in the existing treatment train to protect and enhance the subsequent coagulation process accomplished through addition of polyelectrolytes ferric chloride and calcium hydroxide for the removal of a large part of heavy metals radionuclides phosphate sulfate and fluoride cui et al 2020 liang et al 2009 liu et al 2019 nielson and smith 2005 a second disinfection phase is then present to reduce fouling and biofouling in the following ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis filtrations aimed at final effluent desalination fujioka et al 2020 griebe and flemming 1998 kim et al 2009 2 2 microalgae sampling and counting samples for microalgae quantification were collected in real water samples before disinfection and 2 h after the addition of each disinfectant to quantify the algae concentration a counting chamber was employed paul marienfield gmbh co lauda königshofen germany the chamber is equipped with an optical microscope renishaw uk the concentration of algae cells suspended in the samples was determined by multiplying the average number of cells observed in the microscope images by the relevant area the chamber depth and the dilution factor the nominal statistical error of the counting chamber is defined according to the formula error 1 n where n is the number of counted microalgae cells in the counting of the initial concentration of microalgae the nominal error was roughly 1 4 when only a few cells are counted in the chamber the error is of the same order of magnitude of the measured value therefore for values of the removal efficiency equal or larger than 90 its absolute value is no longer relevant and the disinfection should be considered nearly complete in all the other cases the nominal error was below 10 2 3 bacteria related methods lb saline solution and bacterial suspension preparation luria bertani lb broth was prepared by completely dissolving tryptone 10 g yeast extract 5 g and sodium chloride 10 g in 1 l of deionized water a slightly hypertonic saline medium was also prepared by dissolving sodium chloride 8 g and potassium chloride 0 8 g in 1 l of deionized water the ph of this solution was adjusted to a value between 7 and 7 5 with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl before use the lb and saline mixtures were autoclaved for 15 min at 15 psi at a temperature of 121 c to prepare the bacterial suspension a volume of 5 ml lb was pipetted into a 15 ml falcon tube the e coli strain was a wild type isolate from urban secondary wastewater obtained by isolation and selection of the microorganism on selective growth media the e coli bacterial inoculum was made from a pre prepared master plate a colony was dispersed in 5 ml lb by mixing in a vortex machine for 30 s following this step the falcon tube was placed in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 c for 8 h under gentle agitation by circular motion subsequently 2 5 ml of the suspension was diluted in 250 ml of lb and left for 15 h in the incubator to achieve stationary growth phase 3 5 5 5 od600 and a concentration of roughly 109 colony forming units cfu ml the detailed procedure of bacterial preparation and purification was published elsewhere giannakis et al 2013 2 4 determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of e coli and determination of bacterial disinfection kinetics by biocides the minimum inhibitory concentration mic is typically defined as the minimal concentration of an antimicrobial necessary to inhibit the growth of a target microorganism in this study we adapted the broth dilution assay for the determination of mic with e coli as target microorganism and with the biocides in question instead of antimicrobials used in common mic testing as a proxy of e coli concentration the optical density of the samples was considered measured by a spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength od600 mic is an intrinsic characteristic of each biocide and depends also on the type of bacteria used as an evaluation strain to determine this parameter for the different biocides investigated in this study a falcon tube was filled with a 7 8 108 cfu ml suspension of e coli in lb od600 1 0 1 each biocide was spiked in the suspension at the target concentration and the falcon tube was then incubated for 24 h at 37 c both positive and negative controls i e no biocide and no bacteria respectively were always performed to ensure that no contamination occurred the absorbance at 600 nm wavelength was then measured to determine the optical density followed by calibration with suspensions of known concentrations determined by plating and counting the presence of biocides can result to cell lysis oxidation and or overall reduction of the cellular materials that cause light absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer when the bacteria are intact there was a biocide concentration that caused significant reduction in the optical density to avoid underestimating mic we selected as mic the lowest biocide concentration that maintained optical density at a similar level to the initial spiking final od600 after 24 h 1 0 2 before a 50 decrease in optical density and conversion to a destructive concentration from further addition of the biocide in this manner we can assume that bacterial growth was surely arrested at the chosen mic level furthermore kinetics disinfection experiments were performed in real contaminated groundwater by addition of the various biocides an appropriate amount of lb e coli suspension was added to the matrix to obtain a concentration of bacteria of roughly 106 cfu ml the biocides were added individually to the matrix and samples were collected at regular intervals upon sampling serial dilutions were immediately made in saline medium and the resulting suspensions were spread onto agar plates after 1 day of incubation at 37 c the cfus were counted to determine the concentration of cultivable cells a concentration of biocides equal to 0 03 mm was chosen for kinetics disinfection tests this being the lowest value determined for the removal of microalgae from real groundwater samples vide infra the same disinfection experiments were also performed with metabisulfite and hydrogen peroxide at each respective mic vide infra for mic values determined by experiments 2 5 methodology of life cycle analysis lca the environmental burden from the production of 1 kg of the three most interesting biocides i e mit hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite vide infra were evaluated by life cycle analysis using openlca 1 10 software which incorporates the ecoinvent 3 5 database three different methodologies were employed to conduct the environmental assessments recipe cumulative energy demand ced and ipcc2013 in the case of recipe the environmental analysis was modeled on both the endpoints and the midpoints the latter presented as normalized values on the total impact the ced approach was applied to assess the required energy expressed as the primary energy demand while ipcc2013 analysis with a timeframe of 20 years was performed to assess the global warming potential of the production of the three biocides while hydrogen peroxide is present in the ecoinvent database the impacts of metabisulfite and mit were determined by modeling their most common synthesis approach for metabisulfite the reaction between so2 and naoh was considered while the protocol for mit production was based on literature reports taubert et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection targets and principal characteristics of the studied biocides before the analysis of the efficacy of each disinfectant we present a succinct summary of their main characteristics the mode of action of the 9 biocides investigated in this work is depicted in fig 1 and briefly summarized in table 2 together with each molecular structure hclo clo2 h2o2 and paa can penetrate the phospholipidic membrane through passive diffusion thus these biocides disinfect through an intracellular action by acting on enzymatic processes and by attacking the dna purine bases and the internal cytoplasmic membrane fukuzaki 2006 ghanbari et al 2021 giannakis et al 2016 kitis 2004 maillard 2002 ofori et al 2017 tutumi et al 1973 xia et al 2017 moreover hclo clo2 h2o2 and paa can also damage the outer cellular membrane feng et al 2020 fukuzaki 2006 kitis 2004 persulfate is active toward microorganism disinfection mostly if activated by transition metals wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 an estimation of the oxidation efficiency of an oxidant biocide can be estimated from a thermodynamic standpoint by comparing the redox potential of the reagent with that of bacteria strains the e coli redox potential is generally 0 45 to 0 72 v at ph 7 vs she ruales lonfat et al 2015 therefore all the biocides with a redox potential higher than 0 45 to 0 72 v at ph 7 will be able to damage e coli bacteria through oxidation the two electrophilic biocides namely dbnpa and mit disinfect by means of both extracellular and intracellular actions dbnpa is mostly active by damaging the external cellular membrane through an electrophilic addition to the nucleophilic groups of membrane proteins campa et al 2019 kahrilas et al 2015 mit is active also by inhibiting internal enzymatic processes kahrilas et al 2015 maillard 2002 williams 2006 literature lacks a detailed explanation on the disinfection mechanism of metabisulfite on the basis of previous reports and of its molecular structure it is reasonable to assume that metabisulfite can potentially alter the photosynthetic process of microalgae by releasing so2 in solution and that it can damage the cellular membrane in the same fashion of an electrophilic biocide beekley and hoffman 1981 shimazaki and sugahara 1979 wodzinski et al 1978 yaganza et al 2004 yang et al 2004 but its intracellular activity is still under debate a more exhaustive discussion of the mechanism of disinfection and dbps generation mode for each of the 9 biocides is provided in the supporting information si 3 2 disinfection efficacy as a first step to understand the capability of the various biocides to inactivate e coli bacteria we benchmarked their efficacy under the most unfavorable conditions by assessing their minimum inhibitory concentration mic with the main results summarized in fig 2 in fig 2a and 2b we present the optical density od600 as a proxy of bacterial concentration vs the biocide concentration a decrease in od600 indicates destruction of the cell hence for each biocide the mic was identified as the lowest concentration above which significant decrease in optical density was observed no mic value was found for sulfite in the biocide concentration range investigated in this study that is 0 10 mm and a high mic value 10 mm was found for persulfate therefore these compounds were not used for further investigation on disinfection against e coli the most effective biocides were mit dbnpa h2o2 and paa in this order as they required the lowest concentrations to inhibit bacterial growth fig 2c summarizes the mic values determined for all the biocides fig 3 a reports the values of microalgae removal percentage achieved by employing the different biocides at varying concentrations in the real groundwater samples consistent with the results observed with bacteria and presented in fig 2 sulfite and persulfate showed the lowest biocidal activity also towards microalgae indeed the activity of persulfate for both microbiological and chemical decontamination has been clearly shown only if this reagent is activated by transition metals boukari et al 2011 venieri et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 the literature instead lacks reports about the disinfection efficacy of sulfite in general no evident increase in algae removal rate was observed by increasing the concentration of biocides actually metabisulfite and sulfite showed a similar inverse trend of increasing disinfection efficacy by reducing the reagent concentration which suggests that these reagents may undergo suicidal self inhibition reactions at large concentrations furthermore mit showed the same inverse trend with concentration this compound is known to have a slow biocidal activity moreover it is highly susceptible to oxidation williams 2006 it is thus possible that at high concentration this biocide reacted faster with the oxygen freely present in the solution 0 3 mm than with the microbiological target overall it was found that the lowest concentration of 0 03 mm would allow near maximization of algae removal while minimizing the amount of required mit reagent several algae species such as chlorella adapt well in acidic environments gross 2000 hirooka et al 2017 on the contrary e coli cannot typically survive below ph 4 conner and kotrola 1995 the water matrix effect on e coli viability was investigated to understand this behavior and to isolate the effect of biocides from that of ph the results of e coli cultivability from the three blanks indicate that the acidity of the contaminated groundwater ph 2 8 is responsible for a significant bacterial inactivation within 2 h fig 3a therefore a biocide can only be considered effective toward bacteria disinfection in this matrix if it inactivates e coli faster than 2 h clearly metabisulfite and hydrogen peroxide were able to quickly inactivate e coli at their respective mic on the other hand metabisulfite was not as quickly effective at a low concentration of 0 03 mm fig 3c except also for hclo all the other biocides were instead able to inactivate bacteria at a fast rate even at this low dose which was also found to be the optimal concentration for microalgae removal as stated above fig 3a these data lead to an important conclusion when working with a complex water matrix such as that examined in this study each of the following biocide may be employed at low dose when only microalgae removal is required paa h2o2 clo2 dbnpa mit hclo and metabisulfite on the other hand in the presence of e coli or other persistent surviving bacteria behaving in a similar way the utilization of hclo and metabisulfite requires larger concentration to achieve both an effective algae removal and a suitable antibacterial activity 3 3 generation of disinfection by products the formation of disinfection by products was determined following addition of biocides in the real groundwater matrix as expected clo2 generated thms and in particular tribromomethane a carcinogenic compound at all the investigated concentrations the formation of this halogenated compound upon employment of clo2 is consistent with reports in the literature al otoum et al 2016 gómez lópez et al 2013 as expected also the use hclo and paa induced the formation of halogenated by products dell erba et al 2007 domínguez henao et al 2018 shah et al 2015 xue et al 2017 specifically at biocide concentrations of 15 1 5 and 0 15 mm see table 3 and si for the complete set of analysis tribromomethane was detected as the most prevalent dbp in particular in the case of paa the concentration of halogenated by products sharply increased with increasing disinfectant dose this behavior indicates the involvement of paa itself as a primary source in halogenated by products formation table 2 and si provide a more exhaustive discussion on the generation of dbps related to the nine biocides however thms or other halogenated compounds were not detected at concentrations of biocides equal to 0 075 or 0 03 mm even though both hclo and paa still maintained a suitable disinfectant efficiency therefore 0 075 mm represents the threshold safety related dose for hclo and paa application to the water matrix in examination these results suggest that it should be possible to find a threshold dose for any matrix at which adequate disinfection occurs without the detectable formation of halogenated compounds when employing of hclo and paa notably metabisulfite h2o2 mit sulfite and persulfate did not generate any trace of halogenated compounds even at the upper limits of the biocide concentration range the behavior of sulfite and persulfate may be merely ascribed to their low disinfection activity toward bacteria and algae which limited the formation of by products and prevented the formation of halogenated compounds ultimately we surmise that metabisulfite h2o2 and mit are the most interesting biocides of the study since they maintained high disinfection efficiency toward microorganisms without generating dbps another interesting result obtained in this study is the behavior of dbnpa and the formation of tribromomethane as a disinfection by product specifically the concentration of tribromomethane in water increased linearly with the dose of dbnpa see fig 4 a suggesting that this disinfectant itself is an important source of the related by product the formation of tribromomethane may be ascribed to the molecular structure of the biocide it is reasonable to consider the release of a 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanomethyl group after the nucleophilic acyl substitution between the thiol or aminic residues of the membrane proteins and the disinfectant see section on electrophilic biocides in the si campa et al 2019 kahrilas et al 2015 once in solution the cyano group can be replaced by a bromide present in the aqueous environment 6 4 ppm see table 1 thus forming the most stable by product that is tribromomethane fig 4b at 0 03 mm biocide concentration the formation of halogenated by products was not detected given the reaction mechanism of the disinfectant however it is reasonable to assume that 2 2 dibromo 2 cyanomethane was still released but in quantities that were too modest to react with the bromide and generate tribromomethane at detectable concentration it is interesting to note that mit belongs to the same biocide category of dbnpa i e electrophilic biocides but that its employment was not associated with the formation of halogenated by products fig 4a potentially by virtue of the different molecular structure of the two biocides 3 4 metabisulfite h2o2 and mit logistics of implementation metabisulfite h2o2 and mit resulted equally safe in terms of dbps generation but they are different in terms practical utilization e g storage safety indeed h2o2 and mit are well known in the literature as effective disinfectants giannakis et al 2016 kahrilas et al 2015 williams 2006 however they present some practical limitations compared to metabisulfite firstly the storage of large amounts of h2o2 is dangerous because of its explosive characteristics schreck et al 2004 besides the utilization of hydrogen peroxide is strongly discouraged before membrane desalination systems due to the possible degradation of the membrane when exposed to oxidizing agents da silva et al 2006 kang et al 2007 korolkov et al 2014 on the other hand mit is at both an allergenic and a cytotoxic compound burnett et al 2010 castanedo tardana and zug 2013 groot and weyland 1988 hannuksela 1986 metabisulfite although rarely studied for applications similar to that of this study may be the safest biocide overall also consistent with the hypothesis of its disinfection mechanism table 1 and fig 1 3 5 environmental impacts economic analysis and overall review of biocides a summary of the efficacy and dbps generation potential of the biocides used for the disinfection of leachate contaminated groundwater is reported in fig 5 a in this three dimensional plot a dot is associated with each biocide with the exclusion of persulfate and sulfite the values of mic microalgae removal rate at biocide concentration of 1 5 mm and average formation of halogenated compounds were considered to perform this summary analysis an ideal biocide that is both highly effective and does not induce the production of harmful dbps would sit in the top left corner of the graph chlorine based disinfectants are instead found on the right side of the graph because they are associated with the production of significant concentrations of harfmul dbps the safest biocides in this respect were mit hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite of these three h2o2 and especially mit were found to be highly effective against e coli i e low mic and slightly less so to remove microalgae a larger concentration of metabisulfite may instead be necessary to achieve the same disinfection efficacy of the other two biocides against both algae and bacteria on the basis of these observations the economic and environmental impacts associated with the use of mit hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite were evaluated wholesale cost of reagents was assumed and in particular 1200 400 and 200 ton for respectively mit 14 w w solution in water h2o2 50 v v solution in water and sodium metabisulfite 97 purity to calculate the cost of application to disinfect one cubic meter of contaminated groundwater concentrations of 0 03 mm 0 075 mm and 0 075 mm were considered in the effluent matrix for the three biocides respectively these values are based on the results presented in fig 3a and are thus associated with their effect against microalgae despite mit should be dosed at the lowest concentration the cost of its application would be the largest among the three biocides owing to its high market price see fig 5b the use of hydrogen peroxide and metabisulfite would be economical 0 0025 m3 due to a combination of low price and medium concentration required in the matrix considering the environmental impacts of the three biocides mit is associated with the largest burdens mainly because this substance is toxic for the environment and for humans burnett et al 2010 de groot and herxheimer 1989 schnuch et al 1998 see also fig 5c and figure s1 in the si its production involves the reaction of five compounds namely acrylic acid hydrogen sulfide methanol methylamine and hydrogen chloride thus the exploitation of a large amount of environmental resources fig 5d shows the environmental impacts related to co2 emission which is the major parameter for climate change evaluations in lca analyses a more notable production of co2 is associated to the exploitation of mit this result can be rationalized considering the significant amount of energy required for the extraction processing and production of each of the compounds listed above and necessary for the synthesis of the final reagent the production of h2o2 also involves a relatively large amount of co2 release as it takes place through anthraquinone auto oxidation in addition the use of hydrogen peroxide poses problems of transport and storage because this substance is unstable and may cause fire or explosion on the contrary the application of metabisulfite is not associated to particularly high energy requirements or environmental impacts this result stems from the fact that the electrolytic process aimed at the production of naoh is well established while so2 is a waste element resulting from metal extraction processes and its reuse implies a gain in terms of life cycle another important consideration can be drawn from the results reported in fig 5d almost the totality of the energy supply currently derives from the exploitation of non renewable energy sources in case of mit and hydrogen peroxide production a reduction of the reliance on fossil fuels and a subsequent exploitation of more green energy sources would be strongly beneficial especially in the case of the application of these two biocides as it would result in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions 4 conclusion this study investigated the performance and safety of 9 different biocides hclo paa clo2 h2o2 persulfate dbnpa mit sulfite metabisulfite when employed for the abatement of algae and bacteria e coli in a complex aqueous solution specifically leachate from a phosphogypsum landfill overall the following conclusions can be drawn i various biocides are effective in the removal of algae in acidic wastewater including oxidizing compounds electrophilic biocides and reducing agents in particular algae disinfection rates larger than 80 were achieved even with a low addition 0 03 mm of hclo paa clo2 dbnpa mit or metabisulfite h2o2 required a dose of 0 075 mm to remove algae with a rate equal or larger than 80 ii mit and dbnpa were the most effective biocides against e coli while metabisulfite and hclo required higher dosage to achieve similarly high removal rates therefore no strong correlation between the removal rate against microalgae and against e coli was found in this study for the various biocides in terms of overall disinfection effectiveness the two electrophilic biocides showed the highest performance while addition of sulfite and persulfate as individual reagents had no or little effect iii due to the possible generation of harmful disinfection by products hclo and paa may not be employed for water disinfection with concentrations above a threshold value below this value likely specific for each water matrix these two biocides may represent effective and clean compounds for the abatement of algae and bacteria in the complex water matrix investigated in this study this threshold value was 0 075 mm iv the molecular structure of each biocide plays a key role in the disinfection process a chief example is represented by the different behavior of dbnpa and mit despite their analogous disinfection mechanisms they are both electrophilic biocides dbnpa induced the formation of tribromomethane during disinfection while mit acted as an effective biocide without generation of detectable levels of halogenated compounds v the most favorable biocides within the water matrix analyzed in this study considering simultaneously safety and effectiveness were mit h2o2 and metabisulfite vi in particular metabisulfite represents a highly promising new biocide due to its low cost low environmental impacts and adequate efficacy against both microalgae and bacteria while the effectiveness and disinfection byproduct generation of the biocides were investigated in a specific contaminated matrix the results of this study could be used as guidelines for the choice of the best biocide in different wastewaters oxidizing agents such as paa should not be employed in water matrices with large concentrations of halides especially bromide due to the consequent likely generation of halogenated compounds moreover this study indicates that an optimal biocide dose exists to maximize disinfection and safety therefore preliminary experiments should be performed to determine the correct biocide application in each matrix finally our results suggest that unconventional reagents may be applied effectively for the abatement of microorganisms such as microalgae and e coli within complex water sources in particular metabisulfite is a promising new disinfectant safer and more eco friendly than traditional biocides however further studies are required to understand its disinfection mechanism in detail declaration of competing

17213,medetomidine has been authorized in ship hull paints as an antifouling biocide under the biocidal product regulation in europe since 2016 its release into marine systems causes concerns over persistence and toxicity however the environmental fate of medetomidine has not been fully investigated in this study the photodegradation of medetomidine under natural sunlight conditions was investigated using collected coastal and sea waters in addition the phototransformation of medetomidine with reactive species i e singlet oxygen excited triplet state organic matter and hydroxyl radicals under uva light was examined photoproducts were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography hplc identified by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and time of flight mass spectrometry qtof and reaction mechanisms were proposed the results show that medetomidine is a neutral base pka of protonated form 7 2 that leads to two different protonation states in the aquatic environment photodegradation of neutral medetomidine was dominated by reaction with singlet oxygen while protonated medetomidine was relatively photostable the contribution of reactive species to the overall photodegradation of neutral medetomidine was calculated to provide an assessment of phototransformation of medetomidine the half live of medetomidine was 1 5 days in natural waters phcoastal 8 3 phsea 8 1 under sunlit near surface conditions suggesting that it is not persistent in the aquatic environment because medetomidine has a relatively short half life in sunlit aquatic ecosystems a number of products such as 2 2 3 dimethylphenyl propanamide can be formed by photochemical reactions of medetomidine with unknown consequences for marine and coastal waters

1991 kharasch et al 1991 was introduced as a substitute antifouling biocide for banned organotin biocides to the european market and approved under the biocidal product regulation in 2016 european chemicals agency 2015 as a sedative in veterinary medicine biotransformation in predominantly rats has been studied and various metabolites such as hydroxymedetomidine and medetomidine carboxylic acid were identified salonen and eloranta 1990 hui et al 1997 medetomidine is typically used as a racemic mixture including dexmedetomidine and levomedetomidine where dexmedetomidine inhibits central nervous system excitation in brains european chemicals agency 2015 medetomidine containing antifouling paints are applied as varnish on ship hulls which are generally immersed in the aquatic environment to prevent marine organisms from growing on the surfaces it is considered common that biocides leach from paints to the aquatic system urbanczyk et al 2016 medetomidine was not found in a recent monitoring campaign in danish marinas presumably due to the low market share of medetomidine in current antifouling paints koning et al 2020 however the predicted environmental concentration pec for the baltic sea has been estimated to be 2 3 ng l and 57 ng l for harbors and marinas respectively where the higher marina concentrations reflect the smaller volume of water into which medetomidine is released ohlauson et al 2012 to investigate the potential risk it could pose to non target organisms scientists have studied the environmental toxicity of medetomidine medetomidine s reported biological mode of action is the activation of the octopamine receptor european chemicals agency 2015 previous investigators have found an lc50 48h of 48 2 µg l for the pelagic copepod acartiatonsa wendt et al 2016 medetomidine also caused respiratory disorder in juvenile turbot however juvenile turbot were able to recover within a day unless the concentration was higher than 42 µg l hilvarsson et al 2007 moreover krång and dahlström 2006 reported a decrease in mate search activity in the corophiumvolutator lastly the predicted no effect concentration of medetomidine in marine surface water pnecmarine water was estimated to be 2 ng l based on ec50 data on the acute toxicity to both marine and freshwater species european chemicals agency 2015 given the environmental assessment of medetomidine it is prudent to investigate its transformation processes to fully understand its fate in the aquatic environment environmental fate assessments commonly include hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation stangroom et al 2000 moreover the eu assessment report stated that medetomidine was hydrolytically and photolytically stable european chemicals agency 2015 direct photodegradation of medetomidine is not feasible due to the mismatch between the solar spectrum and medetomidine absorbance fig 1 however the potential for indirect photodegradation by reaction with photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri arnold and mcneill 2007 remains to be investigated previous studies have found environmentally relevant reactions of organic pollutants with several reactive species such singlet oxygen apell et al 2019 hydroxyl radicals song et al 2012 and triplet excited states of natural organic matter wu et al 2020 the potential importance of indirect photodegradation of biocides has also been previously demonstrated for several compounds hensen et al 2019 additionally based on a pka calculator chemicalize 2020 the pka value of protonated and neutral medetomidine is predicted to be 7 07 and 13 13 respectively since the ph of natural aquatic environments ranges from 6 to 9 haag and hoigné 1986 zepp et al 1977 medetomidine is likely to exist in both protonated and neutral forms in natural waters which should be considered when investigating environmental fate in natural water as an imidazole containing compound medetomidine is expected to be reactive with singlet oxygen previous studies found that imidazole substances such as histidine chu et al 2015b sundberg and martin 1974 tomita et al 1969 and cimetidine latch et al 2003 are photolabile in natural organic matter rich waters due to reactions with singlet oxygen via cycloaddition reactions as for other reactions with reactive species reaction of hydroxyl radicals with the methylated benzene ring is expected at near diffusion controlled rates 1010 m 1 s 1 hatipoglu et al 2010 and reaction with the imidazole moiety is also possible llano and eriksson 1999 if however reaction with singlet oxygen does occur at rates 107 m 1 s 1 this reaction pathway is expected to dominate because the steady state concentration of singlet oxygen compared to hydroxyl radical is several orders of magnitude higher schwarzenbach et al 2003 while reactions with triplet states of natural organic matter have been previously observed for nitrogen containing heterocycles such as tryptophan and pyrrole apell et al 2019 janssen et al 2014 it is unclear whether imidazoles would be reactive with this ppri furthermore the indirect phototransformation of medetomidine could depend on the ph because the neutral form could have higher reactivity compared to the protonated form due to greater electron density the purpose of the present study was to assess the photochemical fate of medetomidine in natural waters we investigated the phototransformation of medetomidine in natural waters under natural sunlight conditions the pka of medetomidine was determined by the observed reaction rate constant of medetomidine vs a 1o2 probe furfuryl alcohol ffa as a function of ph due to neutral medetomidine having selective reactivity with singlet oxygen to investigate relative contributions by reactive species to the loss of medetomidine and the degradation pathways in natural aquatic systems the reaction rate constants with singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radical oh and a triplet excited state model sensitizer 3lc were determined for the protonated and neutral form of medetomidine to investigate the possible photoproducts formed during the degradation of medetomidine in aquatic systems phototransformation products of 1o2 mediated reaction with medetomidine were isolated by hplc and investigated by nmr spectroscopy and qtof mass spectrometry possible phototransformation pathways with singlet oxygen were proposed 2 materials and method 2 1 materials dexmedetomidine used for generating photoproducts and sodium benzoate were purchased from sigma

medetomidine 2 2 1 photodegradation under natural conditions to mimic the environmental degradation of medetomidine in natural conditions solutions spiked with medetomidine in natural waters were exposed to natural sunlight in a wooden setup for 23 days during may june 2018 as described in a previous study cai et al 2021 briefly the outdoor setup was built as a closed container to avoid contamination from the environment such as living organisms dust and rain di water was added between sampling to replace water loss due to the evaporation the depth of the water in this setup was 5 cm medetomidine 25 µm was spiked into deionized water reverse osmosis unit maxi ro equipped with an aquada uv ultraviolet water disinfection coastal water collected from roskilde fjord risø denmark and sea water collected from kattegat liseleje denmark to investigate its photochemical and hydrolytic degradation experiments were conducted in duplicate and a dark control experiment for each water was included in parallel by covering the container with aluminum foil to exclude sunlight water properties are shown in table s1 the waters were subsampled in duplicate over 22 days after sampling an internal standard d3 medetomidine was added to the 1 ml aliquots for medetomidine quantification while medetomidine was quantified immediately the second aliquot was frozen at 20 c for further phototransformation product analysis the quantification of medetomidine and its photoproducts was conducted by using method 1 and method 4 described in section 2 3 respectively 2 2 2 simulated photodegradation under laboratory conditions using photosensitizers all indirect photodegradation experiments were conducted in a merry go round photochemical reactor rayonet southern new england ultraviolet co using eight to twelve bulbs emitting uva light centered at 365 nm rpr 3500 å this photoreactor is commonly used in environmental photochemistry experiments and the rotating sample holder provides a homogenous light field the observation of pseudo first order degradation rates for all compounds showed that the irradiance was steady through the duration of the experiments solutions 8 ml were added to borosilicate glass test tubes and 200 µl aliquots were sampled at certain time points for quantification 2 2 3 determination of pka only minor absorption spectrum differences of medetomidine at ph 5 and ph 9 were observed therefore the pka value of medetomidine was determined by measuring the phototransformation reaction rate constants of medetomidine against the probe compound ffa at different ph values ranging from 4 4 to 10 7 steady state photolysis experiments were conducted using zinc porphyrin znp which has a low triplet state reduction potential e s s of 0 78 vshe kalyanasundaram and neumann spallart 1982 as the 1o2 sensitizer all solutions prepared for singlet oxygen steady state experiments contained medetomidine 20 µm ffa 40 µm buffer 5 mm and the photosensitizer znp 1 µm the ph values were measured before and after irradiation the ratio of the bimolecular reaction rate constants of medetomidine and ffa with singlet oxygen was determined using competition kinetics according to eq 1 1 ln med t med 0 k med 1 o 2 k ffa 1 o 2 ln ffa t ffa 0 thus the pka value was determined by fitting the measured relative rate constants k m e d 1 o 2 k f

neutral medetomidine against ffa when ph pka 2 2 4 singlet oxygen the photochemical transformation rate constants of medetomidine with singlet oxygen were measured through steady state photolysis in the presence of the photosensitizer zinc porphyrin znp at ph 9 2 and ph 10 5 respectively where medetomidine was in the neutral form pka of the protonated form of medetomidine is 7 2 see fig 3 less than 0 2 ph unit differences in solutions were observed before and after irradiation the bimolecular rate constant of neutral medetomidine with singlet oxygen was calculated using eq 1 and the known reaction rate constant of ffa with 1o2 at 22 c of 1 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 the degradation kinetics of both medetomidine and ffa were monitored using the analytical lc uv method 2 described in section 2 3 2 2 5 triplet state organic matter photodegradation experiments of medetomidine using the model sensitizer lumichrome lc were conducted at ph 5 and 9 where medetomidine was predominantly in its protonated med or neutral form med0 respectively 1o2 sensitized experiments were conducted in parallel to compare the kinetics the solutions contained medetomidine 20 µm ffa 40 µm buffer 5 mm and a photosensitizer lc or znp 1 µm the irradiation lasted for three hours and aliquots were taken every 30 minutes for lc uv analysis the analysis was conducted by using lc uv method 2 described in section 2 3 2 2 6 hydroxyl radical hydroxyl radical mediated experiments were conducted under four experimental conditions with hydrogen peroxide 2 mm or sodium nitrite 0 1 mm as sources of hydroxyl radicals at ph 5 6 97 3 protonated and 2 7 neutral medetomidine according to the henderson hasselbalch equation and 9 2 99 neutral medetomidine respectively sodium benzoate 10 µm was used as a probe compound since it has a pka value of 4 2 mihyar et al 1997 97 5 of benzoate was deprotonated at ph 5 6 to prevent the reaction between acetonitrile and hydroxyl radicals residual acetonitrile in the medetomidine stock solution was evaporated before adding the reaction solutions the analysis was conducted using lc uv method 3 the bimolecular reaction rate constant with hydroxyl radicals was calculated by using competition kinetics according to eq 3 3 k med o h ln med t med 0 ln benzoate t benzoate 0 k benz oate o h where the reaction rate constant of benzoate with hydroxyl radical is 5 9 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 2 2 7 contributions of reactive species the measured rate constants of medetomidine were used to estimate an overall photodegradation rate under natural conditions by summing the products of the bimolecular reaction rate constants and reported steady state concentrations of the reactive species according to eq 4 the contribution of 1o2 and oh corresponding to the total loss of medetomidine were determined using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 k exp k med 1 o 2 1 o 2 ss k med o h o h ss 5 1 o 2 contribution k med 1 o 2 1 o 2 ss k exp 6 o h cont ribu tion k med o h o h ss k exp where 1 o 2 s s and o h ss are the steady state concentrations of 1o2 and oh and k med 1 o 2 and k med o h are the bimolecular reaction rate constants of medetomidine with 1o2 and oh respectively the steady state concentration of oh in sunlit waters was reported to be 2 63 10 17 m in coastal upwelled water by mopper and zhou 1990 and the steady state concentration of 1o2 was reported to be 10 13 m by peterson et al 2012 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of medetomidine method 1 degradation of medetomidine was quantified using hplc ms ms using electrospray ionization

in natural waters rapid degradation was observed for medetomidine in sunlit coastal and sea waters fig 2 while there was no significant decay of concentration over time in deionized water this was expected due to negligible absorbance of medetomidine in the solar spectrum fig 1 because medetomidine will not absorb sunlight at any geographic location or at any time of the year this supports the conclusion in the european assessment report that it is stable with respect to direct photolysis european chemicals agency 2015 apell and mcneill 2019 the concentration at the first timepoint was slightly lower than the target concentration which could have been caused by incomplete mixing the concentration of medetomidine in coastal and sea water showed exponential decay as a function of irradiation time in sunlit conditions and dark controls since medetomidine showed no decay in deionized water it was determined to be hydrolytically stable therefore the degradation in dark controls could be attributed to biodegradation degradation in both sunlit and dark conditions imply that photodegradation and biodegradation occurred and followed pseudo first order kinetics within the scope of this paper we will focus on photodegradation in coastal water the decay rate was 12 times faster in sunlit system than in the dark control t 1 2 0 78 d and 9 3 d respectively and in seawater the decay rate was 9 times faster in sunlit conditions t 1 2 1 24 d vs 11 3 d therefore indirect photodegradation was hypothesized to be relevant for the environmental fate of medetomidine furthermore shorter half lives in coastal water than sea water were attributed to the elevated dissolved organic matter concentration 8 1 mgc l and 4 1 mgc l in coastal and sea water respectively and the different ph values of the waters phcoastal water 8 3 phsea water 8 1 because a higher proportion of neutral medetomidine would exist in coastal water the indirect phototransformation of medetomidine could be due to reaction with reactive species such as triplet state organic matter singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals consequently reaction kinetics pathways and photoproducts of different reactive species were investigated 3 2 simulated photodegradation under laboratory conditions using photosensitizers 3 2 1 determination of pka initially spectroscopic titration methods to determine the pka of the protonated form were applied however the detected absorbance difference between protonated and neutral medetomidine was negligible absorbance difference 0 01 at 219 nm fig 1 moreover the imidazole ring has been reported as a reaction site for singlet oxygen reactions iesce et al 2005 and its reaction rate constant is likely to be ph dependent similar to histidine bisby et al 1999 in contrast furfuryl alcohol shows no ph dependence appiani et al 2017 therefore in this study the relative reaction rate constants of medetomidine and ffa were plotted as a function of ph to determine the pka of the protonated form the photochemical reaction of medetomidine with singlet oxygen followed pseudo first order kinetics and was ph dependent single experiments are shown in figures s1 s4 and summarized in table s4 the result illustrates a typical titration curve for the ph dependent photosensitized transformation of medetomidine with singlet oxygen fig 3 accordingly the pka value was determined to be 7 20 0 06 which matches the result from the clh report uk competent authority chemicals 2014 hence we could conclude that both protonation states would be present in the marine environment ph 8 1 a significant increase of the relative rate constants from zero to 1 8 was observed with increasing ph values from 5 1 to 10 5 indicating that neutral medetomidine had higher photoreactivity than protonated medetomidine the higher bimolecular rate constant of neutral medetomidine k me d 0 1 o 2 than the protonated form k me d 1 o 2 with singlet oxygen is in agreement with the higher 1o2 reactivity of the neutral form of the imidazole ring bisby et al 1999 chu et al 2015a 2015b 3 2 2 photodegradation with 1o2 and 3lc steady state photodegradation experiments with singlet oxygen showed that neutral medetomidine had high reactivity with singlet oxygen and followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 4 a from the experiments that were conducted 2 ph units above the pka the bimolecular rate constant of neutral medetomidine with singlet oxygen was determined to be 1 80 0 02 108 m 1s 1 using eq 1 the potential for medetomidine to react with triplet states of organic matter was investigated by using lumichrome lc as a model sensitizer fig 4b lc has an excited state one electron reduction potential e0 3s s of 1 91 vshe mcneill and canonica 2016 which is substantially higher than the potential for znp e0 3s s 0 78vshe and is more representative of the most reactive triplet pools of natural organic matter no obvious increase of degradation rate was observed compared to using znp as singlet oxygen sensitizer which indicated no 3lc mediated reaction occurred for either protonated or neutral medetomidine therefore it is unlikely that medetomidine reacts with triplet states of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter 3 2 3 photodegradation with hydroxyl radicals the oh mediated reaction rate constant was determined in two separate experiments by using h2o2 and nano2 as oh sources respectively fig 5 the bimolecular rate constants of protonated and neutral medetomidine with hydroxyl radical were determined to be 8 14 0 10 109 m 1s 1 and 1 06 0 02 1010 m 1s 1 using eq 3 both forms of medetomidine react with hydroxyl radicals since the benzene ring is expected to be a primary reaction site page et al 2011 the reaction of methylated benzene is expected to be slightly higher than the benzene ring based on reactions of oh radical with benzene and toluene schuler and albarran 2002 seta et al 2006 in addition samuni and neta 1973 reported that imidazole rings could undergo hydroxylation at ph 9 10 which is consistent with neutral medetomidine showing higher reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals than the protonated form a slightly higher ratio of reaction rate constants was observed when using nano2 knano2 1 85 0 04 kh2o2 1 74 0 02 figure s5 for the experiments conducted at ph 9 2 which might be attributable to the reaction of no2 with neutral medetomidine and would provide an additional loss process nélieu et al 2004 scholes et al 2019 3 2 4 contributions of reactive species according to eq 4 in section 2 2 7 the expected rate constants of protonated and neutral medetomidine are calculated to be 2 14 0 03 10 7 s 1 and 1 83 0 02 10 5 s 1 respectively moreover using eqs 5 6 described in section 2 2 7 for the degradation of protonated medetomidine the 1o2 mediated reaction was negligible as it was fully attributed to the oh mediated reaction by contrast the 1o2 mediated reaction exhibited the highest contribution for neutral medetomidine accounting for 98 5 while oh mediated reaction contributed the remainder 3 3 identification of phototransformation products four major phototransformation products were detected by hplc uv in the 1o2 mediated reactions three of the photoproducts 5 6 and 10 which showed the largest peak areas on hplc uv were isolated during reaction with 1o2 fig 6 photoproduct 10 had the highest isolated mass whereas photoproducts 5 and 6 had equal peak areas in the lc uv chromatograms their structures were elucidated using nmr and further validated by qtof ms2 spectra interpretation due to insufficient mass for nmr analysis the identification of photoproduct 2 was proposed based on comprehensive interpretation of the ms2 fragmentation the measured ms2 and nmr spectra along with the detailed interpretation are summarized in text s1and s2 photoproduct 2 photoproduct 2 fig 6 is proposed as an intermediate of the formation of products 5 and 6 the detected m z of photoproduct 2 4 1 2 3 dimethylphenyl ethyl 2 hydroperoxy 2 5 dihydro 1h imidazol 5 ol was 251 1403 c13h19n2o3 text s1 s1 1 the major ms2 m z fragments obtained were 173 0970 145 1015 130 0777 and 105 0695 the detected m z 105 0695 c8h9 indicated the structure of 1 2 dimethylbenzene and fragment 145 1015 suggested the formula c11h13 in addition m z 130 0777 c10h10 could be formed by cleavage of the imidazole ring as possible intermediates photoproduct 2 and photoproduct 9 fig 6 had the same theoretical monoisotopic mass however the characteristic fragment m z 173 097 was assigned to the formula of c12h13o complying with the loss of ch4n2o and a water molecule hence this supports the photoproduct 2 structure shown below as the most plausible photoproducts 5 and 6 hplc qtof

atoms to the parent medetomidine fig 6 1h nmr analysis of 5 5 1 2 3 dimethylphenyl ethyl imidazolidine 2 4 dione showed the loss of the imidazole proton signals h 2 and h 5 and emergence of a deshielded one proton doublet at δ 4 20 h 4 and two broad one proton singlets at δ 4 92 nh 3 and δ 7 19 nh 1 the nmr shift data for h c 6 through h c 15 indicated that this part of the structure i e trimethylbenzyl unit matched that of the parent compound medetomidine the hmbc spectrum figure s12 showed key correlations blue arrows in fig 6 from h 4 to two non protonated sp2 hybridized carbons at δ 155 3 c 2 and δ 172 6 c 5 a methine carbon at δ 37 6 c 6 and a methyl carbon at δ 18 2 c 7 thereby establishing a hydantoin ring fang et al 2011 senior et al 2007 and allowing for the complete structural assignment of 5 aside from minor shift differences the nmr analysis of 6 was completely analogous to that of 5 suggesting the two products are c 4 c 6 diastereomers the detected ms2 spectra of the 5 and 6 diastereomers also display the same fragments texts1 s1 2 and s1 3 the fragment m z of 133 1018 c10h13 was observed and the subsequent loss of methyl groups resulted in the formation of

the structure i e trimethylbenzyl unit matched that of the parent compound the hmbc spectrum figure s20 showed key correlations blue arrows in fig 6 from h 6 and h 7 to an amide carbon at δ 177 0 c 4 together the data are consistent with imidazole ring fragmentation to a primary amide as shown in fig 6 for 10 the same fragments m z 133 1020 105 0703 and 91 0546 were observed as those of the fragments of the photoproducts 5 6 additionally m z 133 1019 c10h13 was measured resulting from the loss of a formamide group ch3no from the parent ion 3 3 1 proposed pathways and formation of photoproducts in simulated natural environment two pathways for the 1o2 mediated reaction of medetomidine were proposed fig 6 based on the chemical structures of the identified photoproducts and the sequence of the photoproducts formation during both uva irradiation and simulated natural sunlight experiments for both pathways 2 5 or 4 5 cycloaddition are presumed to be the first step to form unstable endo peroxide or dioxetane intermediates photoproduct 1 and 7 these processes were previously reported for imidazole containing compounds iesce et al 2005 latch et al 2003 tomita et al 1969 in pathway 1 the endo peroxide would be susceptible to hydrolysis to yield 2 and a subsequent dehydration would lead to the formation of 3 photoproducts 4 5 and 6 are proposed to form from sequential tautomerizations of 3 in pathway 2 photoproduct 8 is proposed to form from ring opening of the dioxetane intermediate 7 intermediate 8 would be susceptible to hydration of the imine group c n to give intermediate 9 and a subsequent elimination of c2h3no2 would yield isolated product 10 since the largest peak area was observed on hplc uv and the highest mass was collected for photoproduct 10 the formation of 10 was considered to be more efficient than photoproduct 5 and 6 and thus it is likely that pathway 2 is favored to investigate the phototransformation of medetomidine in simulated natural conditions the formation peak area vs experimental days of the proposed photoproducts in sunlit coastal water is presented in fig 7 the ph of coastal water was 8 3 higher than the pka of protonated medetomidine therefore fast degradation of medetomidine along with the formation of the previously identified photoproducts are expected in natural conditions the concentration of photoproducts generally increased for the first few days of the experiment when medetomidine degradation was significant after medetomidine was no longer detectable in the waters t 7 days their response areas were relatively stable this indicates that the photoproducts are not as susceptible to photodegradation as the parent compound and are expected to persist in the environment for longer times moreover the transformation products eluted later than medetomidine during reverse phased lc analysis which suggests they are more hydrophobic than medetomidine reported logk ow 2 9 ohlauson et al 2012 previous studies have also found that the transformation products of biocides used for coating facades as is the case for medetomidine accumulated in soils bollmann et al 2017 and leached into groundwater hensen et al 2018 thus sorption and accumulation of medetomidine photoproducts in sediments or soils could occur as well nonetheless verification of these hypotheses will require further studies 4 conclusion this study showed that medetomidine degrades via indirect photolysis in marine environments in contrast it was shown that medetomidine is hydrolytically stable no significant direct photodegradation occurred in di water and considerably slower degradation potentially due to biodegradation processes was observed in dark conditions nonetheless the photochemical behavior of medetomidine is highly dependent on the aquatic environmental conditions such as ph and nom content medetomidine in its neutral state is the predominant form expected in marine waters pka of protonated form 7 2 the neutral form showed high reactivity with singlet oxygen while other reactive species i e hydroxy radicals and triplet state organic matter played a minor to no role the contribution by other water constituents e g halogen radicals and fe2 ions requires further studies similar to other imidazole containing compounds medetomidine undergoes cycloaddition reactions with singlet oxygen and four identified photoproducts for the 1o2 mediated reaction support this hypothesis the chemical structures and properties of these photoproducts have never been reported before but they could become potential contaminants in the marine environment especially because medetomidine degraded rapidly in natural waters and the transformation products showed potential persistence in the aquatic environment medetomidine is known to have negative effects on non target species therefore it is prudent to evaluate the toxicity of its phototransformation products to aquatic organisms to fully understand the environmental fate and potential risk of this biocide the present study on medetomidine showed clearly that the environmental assessment regarding photostability based purely on the evaluation of direct photodegradation potential is insufficient a potential dissipation pathway is neglected and the risk arising from potentially toxic phototransformation products might be

17213,medetomidine has been authorized in ship hull paints as an antifouling biocide under the biocidal product regulation in europe since 2016 its release into marine systems causes concerns over persistence and toxicity however the environmental fate of medetomidine has not been fully investigated in this study the photodegradation of medetomidine under natural sunlight conditions was investigated using collected coastal and sea waters in addition the phototransformation of medetomidine with reactive species i e singlet oxygen excited triplet state organic matter and hydroxyl radicals under uva light was examined photoproducts were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography hplc identified by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and time of flight mass spectrometry qtof and reaction mechanisms were proposed the results show that medetomidine is a neutral base pka of protonated form 7 2 that leads to two different protonation states in the aquatic environment photodegradation of neutral medetomidine was dominated by reaction with singlet oxygen while protonated medetomidine was relatively photostable the contribution of reactive species to the overall photodegradation of neutral medetomidine was calculated to provide an assessment of phototransformation of medetomidine the half live of medetomidine was 1 5 days in natural waters phcoastal 8 3 phsea 8 1 under sunlit near surface conditions suggesting that it is not persistent in the aquatic environment because medetomidine has a relatively short half life in sunlit aquatic ecosystems a number of products such as 2 2 3 dimethylphenyl propanamide can be formed by photochemical reactions of medetomidine with unknown consequences for marine and coastal waters

were identified salonen and eloranta 1990 hui et al 1997 medetomidine is typically used as a racemic mixture including dexmedetomidine and levomedetomidine where dexmedetomidine inhibits central nervous system excitation in brains european chemicals agency 2015 medetomidine containing antifouling paints are applied as varnish on ship hulls which are generally immersed in the aquatic environment to prevent marine organisms from growing on the surfaces it is considered common that biocides leach from paints to the aquatic system urbanczyk et al 2016 medetomidine was not found in a recent monitoring campaign in danish marinas presumably due to the low market share of medetomidine in current antifouling paints koning et al 2020 however the predicted environmental concentration pec for the baltic sea has been estimated to be 2 3 ng l and 57 ng l for harbors and marinas respectively where the higher marina concentrations reflect the smaller volume of water into which medetomidine is released ohlauson et al 2012 to investigate the potential risk it could pose to non target organisms scientists have studied the environmental toxicity of medetomidine medetomidine s reported biological mode of action is the activation of the octopamine receptor european chemicals agency 2015 previous investigators have found an lc50 48h of 48 2 µg l for the pelagic copepod acartiatonsa wendt et al 2016 medetomidine also caused respiratory disorder in juvenile turbot however juvenile turbot were able to recover within a day unless the concentration was higher than 42 µg l hilvarsson et al 2007 moreover krång and dahlström 2006 reported a decrease in mate search activity in the corophiumvolutator lastly the predicted no effect concentration of medetomidine in marine surface water pnecmarine water was estimated to be 2 ng l based on ec50 data on the acute toxicity to both marine and freshwater species european chemicals agency 2015 given the environmental assessment of medetomidine it is prudent to investigate its transformation processes to fully understand its fate in the aquatic environment environmental fate assessments commonly include hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation stangroom et al 2000 moreover the eu assessment report stated that medetomidine was hydrolytically and photolytically stable european chemicals agency 2015 direct photodegradation of medetomidine is not feasible due to the mismatch between the solar spectrum and medetomidine absorbance fig 1 however the potential for indirect photodegradation by reaction with photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri arnold and mcneill 2007 remains to be investigated previous studies have found environmentally relevant reactions of organic pollutants with several reactive species such singlet oxygen apell et al 2019 hydroxyl radicals song et al 2012 and triplet excited states of natural organic matter wu et al 2020 the potential importance of indirect photodegradation of biocides has also been previously demonstrated for several compounds hensen et al 2019 additionally based on a pka calculator chemicalize 2020 the pka value of protonated and neutral medetomidine is predicted to be 7 07 and 13 13 respectively since the ph of natural aquatic environments ranges from 6 to 9 haag and hoigné 1986 zepp et al 1977 medetomidine is likely to exist in both protonated and neutral forms in natural waters which should be considered when investigating environmental fate in natural water as an imidazole containing compound medetomidine is expected to be reactive with singlet oxygen previous studies found that imidazole substances such as histidine chu et al 2015b sundberg and martin 1974 tomita et al 1969 and cimetidine latch et al 2003 are photolabile in natural organic matter rich waters due to reactions with singlet oxygen via cycloaddition reactions as for other reactions with reactive species reaction of hydroxyl radicals with the methylated benzene ring is expected at near diffusion controlled rates 1010 m 1 s 1 hatipoglu et al 2010 and reaction with the imidazole moiety is also possible llano and eriksson 1999 if however reaction with singlet oxygen does occur at rates 107 m 1 s 1 this reaction pathway is expected to dominate because the steady state concentration of singlet oxygen compared to hydroxyl radical is several orders of magnitude higher schwarzenbach et al 2003 while reactions with triplet states of natural organic matter have been previously observed for nitrogen containing heterocycles such as tryptophan and pyrrole apell et al 2019 janssen et al 2014 it is unclear whether imidazoles would be reactive with this ppri furthermore the indirect phototransformation of medetomidine could depend on the ph because the neutral form could have higher reactivity compared to the protonated form due to greater electron density the purpose of the present study was to assess the photochemical fate of medetomidine in natural waters we investigated the phototransformation of medetomidine in natural waters under natural sunlight conditions the pka of medetomidine was determined by the observed reaction rate constant of medetomidine vs a 1o2 probe furfuryl alcohol ffa as a function of ph due to neutral medetomidine having selective reactivity with singlet oxygen to investigate relative contributions by reactive species to the loss of medetomidine and the degradation pathways in natural aquatic systems the reaction rate constants with singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radical oh and a triplet excited state model sensitizer 3lc were determined for the protonated and neutral form of medetomidine to investigate the possible photoproducts formed during the degradation of medetomidine in aquatic systems phototransformation products of 1o2 mediated reaction with medetomidine were isolated by hplc and investigated by nmr spectroscopy and qtof mass spectrometry possible

medetomidine 2 2 1 photodegradation under natural conditions to mimic the environmental degradation of medetomidine in natural conditions solutions spiked with medetomidine in natural waters were exposed to natural sunlight in a wooden setup for 23 days during may june 2018 as described in a previous study cai et al 2021 briefly the outdoor setup was built as a closed container to avoid contamination from the environment such as living organisms dust and rain di water was added between sampling to replace water loss due to the evaporation the depth of the water in this setup was 5 cm medetomidine 25 µm was spiked into deionized water reverse osmosis unit maxi ro equipped with an aquada uv ultraviolet water disinfection coastal water collected from roskilde fjord risø denmark and sea water collected from kattegat liseleje denmark to investigate its photochemical and hydrolytic degradation experiments were conducted in duplicate and a dark control experiment for each water was included in parallel by covering the container with aluminum foil to exclude sunlight water properties are shown in table s1 the waters were subsampled in duplicate over 22 days after sampling an internal standard d3 medetomidine was added to the 1 ml aliquots for medetomidine quantification while medetomidine was quantified immediately the second aliquot was frozen at 20 c for further phototransformation product analysis the quantification of medetomidine and its photoproducts was conducted by using method 1 and method 4 described in section 2 3 respectively 2 2 2 simulated photodegradation under laboratory conditions using photosensitizers all indirect photodegradation experiments were conducted in a merry go round photochemical reactor rayonet southern new england ultraviolet co using eight to twelve bulbs emitting uva light centered at 365 nm rpr 3500 å this photoreactor is commonly used in environmental photochemistry experiments and the rotating sample holder provides a homogenous light field the observation of pseudo first order degradation rates for all compounds showed that the irradiance was steady through the duration of the experiments solutions 8 ml were added to borosilicate glass test tubes and 200 µl aliquots were sampled at certain time points for quantification 2 2 3 determination of pka only minor absorption spectrum differences of medetomidine at ph 5 and ph 9 were observed therefore the pka value of medetomidine was determined by measuring the phototransformation reaction rate constants of medetomidine against the probe compound ffa at different ph values ranging from 4 4 to 10 7 steady state photolysis experiments were conducted using zinc porphyrin znp which has a low triplet state reduction potential e s s of 0 78 vshe kalyanasundaram and neumann spallart 1982 as the 1o2 sensitizer all solutions prepared for singlet oxygen steady state experiments contained medetomidine 20 µm ffa 40 µm buffer 5 mm and the photosensitizer znp 1 µm the ph values were measured before and after irradiation the ratio of the bimolecular reaction rate constants of medetomidine and ffa with singlet oxygen was determined using competition kinetics according to eq 1 1 ln med t med 0 k med 1 o 2 k ffa 1 o 2 ln ffa t ffa 0 thus the pka value was determined by fitting the measured relative rate constants k m e d 1 o 2 k f

neutral medetomidine against ffa when ph pka 2 2 4 singlet oxygen the photochemical transformation rate constants of medetomidine with singlet oxygen were measured through steady state photolysis in the presence of the photosensitizer zinc porphyrin znp at ph 9 2 and ph 10 5 respectively where medetomidine was in the neutral form pka of the protonated form of medetomidine is 7 2 see fig 3 less than 0 2 ph unit differences in solutions were observed before and after irradiation the bimolecular rate constant of neutral medetomidine with singlet oxygen was calculated using eq 1 and the known reaction rate constant of ffa with 1o2 at 22 c of 1 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 the degradation kinetics of both medetomidine and ffa were monitored using the analytical lc uv method 2 described in section 2 3 2 2 5 triplet state organic matter photodegradation experiments of medetomidine using the model sensitizer lumichrome lc were conducted at ph 5 and 9 where medetomidine was predominantly in its protonated med or neutral form med0 respectively 1o2 sensitized experiments were conducted in parallel to compare the kinetics the solutions contained medetomidine 20 µm ffa 40 µm buffer 5 mm and a photosensitizer lc or znp 1 µm the irradiation lasted for three hours and aliquots were taken every 30 minutes for lc uv analysis the analysis was conducted by using lc uv method 2 described in section 2 3 2 2 6 hydroxyl radical hydroxyl radical mediated experiments were conducted under four experimental conditions with hydrogen peroxide 2 mm or sodium nitrite 0 1 mm as sources of hydroxyl radicals at ph 5 6 97 3 protonated and 2 7 neutral medetomidine according to the henderson hasselbalch equation and 9 2 99 neutral medetomidine respectively sodium benzoate 10 µm was used as a probe compound since it has a pka value of 4 2 mihyar et al 1997 97 5 of benzoate was deprotonated at ph 5 6 to prevent the reaction between acetonitrile and hydroxyl radicals residual acetonitrile in the medetomidine stock solution was evaporated before adding the reaction solutions the analysis was conducted using lc uv method 3 the bimolecular reaction rate constant with hydroxyl radicals was calculated by using competition kinetics according to eq 3 3 k med o h ln med t med 0 ln benzoate t benzoate 0 k benz oate o h where the reaction rate constant of benzoate with hydroxyl radical is 5 9 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 2 2 7 contributions of reactive species the measured rate constants of medetomidine were used to estimate an overall photodegradation rate under natural conditions by summing the products of the bimolecular reaction rate constants and reported steady state concentrations of the reactive species according to eq 4 the contribution of 1o2 and oh corresponding to the total loss of medetomidine were determined using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 k exp k med 1 o 2 1 o 2 ss k med o h o h ss 5 1 o 2 contribution k med 1 o 2 1 o 2 ss k exp 6 o h cont ribu tion k med o h o

respectively the steady state concentration of oh in sunlit waters was reported to be 2 63 10 17 m in coastal upwelled water by mopper and zhou 1990 and the steady state concentration of 1o2 was reported to be 10 13 m by peterson et al 2012 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of medetomidine method 1 degradation of medetomidine was quantified using hplc ms ms using electrospray ionization

in natural waters rapid degradation was observed for medetomidine in sunlit coastal and sea waters fig 2 while there was no significant decay of concentration over time in deionized water this was expected due to negligible absorbance of medetomidine in the solar spectrum fig 1 because medetomidine will not absorb sunlight at any geographic location or at any time of the year this supports the conclusion in the european assessment report that it is stable with respect to direct photolysis european chemicals agency 2015 apell and mcneill 2019 the concentration at the first timepoint was slightly lower than the target concentration which could have been caused by incomplete mixing the concentration of medetomidine in coastal and sea water showed exponential decay as a function of irradiation time in sunlit conditions and dark controls since medetomidine showed no decay in deionized water it was determined to be hydrolytically stable therefore the degradation in dark controls could be attributed to biodegradation degradation in both sunlit and dark conditions imply that photodegradation and biodegradation occurred and followed pseudo first order kinetics within the scope of this paper we will focus on photodegradation in coastal water the decay rate was 12 times faster in sunlit system than in the dark control t 1 2 0 78 d and 9 3 d respectively and in seawater the decay rate was 9 times faster in sunlit conditions t 1 2 1 24 d vs 11 3 d therefore indirect photodegradation was hypothesized to be relevant for the environmental fate of medetomidine furthermore shorter half lives in coastal water than sea water were attributed to the elevated dissolved organic matter concentration 8 1 mgc l and 4 1 mgc l in coastal and sea water respectively and the different ph values of the waters phcoastal water 8 3 phsea water 8 1 because a higher proportion of neutral medetomidine would exist in coastal water the indirect phototransformation of medetomidine could be due to reaction with reactive species such as triplet state organic matter singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals consequently reaction kinetics pathways and photoproducts of different reactive species were investigated 3 2 simulated photodegradation under laboratory conditions using photosensitizers 3 2 1 determination of pka initially spectroscopic titration methods to determine the pka of the protonated form were applied however the detected absorbance difference between protonated and neutral medetomidine was negligible absorbance difference 0 01 at 219 nm fig 1 moreover the imidazole ring has been reported as a reaction site for singlet oxygen reactions iesce et al 2005 and its reaction rate constant is likely to be ph dependent similar to histidine bisby et al 1999 in contrast furfuryl alcohol shows no ph dependence appiani et al 2017 therefore in this study the relative reaction rate constants of medetomidine and ffa were plotted as a function of ph to determine the pka of the protonated form the photochemical reaction of medetomidine with singlet oxygen followed pseudo first order kinetics and was ph dependent single experiments are shown in figures s1 s4 and summarized in table s4 the result illustrates a typical titration curve for the ph dependent photosensitized transformation of medetomidine with singlet oxygen fig 3 accordingly the pka value was determined to be 7 20 0 06 which matches the result from the clh report uk competent authority chemicals 2014 hence we could conclude that both protonation states would be present in the marine environment ph 8 1 a significant increase of the relative rate constants from zero to 1 8 was observed with increasing ph values from 5 1 to 10 5 indicating that neutral medetomidine had higher photoreactivity than protonated medetomidine the higher bimolecular rate constant of neutral medetomidine k me d 0 1 o 2 than the protonated form k me d 1 o 2 with singlet oxygen is in agreement with the higher 1o2 reactivity of the neutral form of the imidazole ring bisby et al 1999 chu et al 2015a 2015b 3 2 2 photodegradation with 1o2 and 3lc steady state photodegradation experiments with singlet oxygen showed that neutral medetomidine had high reactivity with singlet oxygen and followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 4 a from the experiments that were conducted 2 ph units above the pka the bimolecular rate constant of neutral medetomidine with singlet oxygen was determined to be 1 80 0 02 108 m 1s 1 using eq 1 the potential for medetomidine to react with triplet states of organic matter was investigated by using lumichrome lc as a model sensitizer fig 4b lc has an excited state one electron reduction potential e0 3s s of 1 91 vshe mcneill and canonica 2016 which is substantially higher than the potential for znp e0 3s s 0 78vshe and is more representative of the most reactive triplet pools of natural organic matter no obvious increase of degradation rate was observed compared to using znp as singlet oxygen sensitizer which indicated no 3lc mediated reaction occurred for either protonated or neutral medetomidine therefore it is unlikely that medetomidine reacts with triplet states of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter 3 2 3 photodegradation with hydroxyl radicals the oh mediated reaction rate constant was determined in two separate experiments by using h2o2 and nano2 as oh sources respectively fig 5 the bimolecular rate constants of protonated and neutral medetomidine with hydroxyl radical were determined to be 8 14 0 10 109 m 1s 1 and 1 06 0 02 1010 m 1s 1 using eq 3 both forms of medetomidine react with hydroxyl radicals since the benzene ring is expected to be a primary reaction site page et al 2011 the reaction of methylated benzene is expected to be slightly higher than the benzene ring based on reactions of oh radical with benzene and toluene schuler and albarran 2002 seta et al 2006 in addition samuni and neta 1973 reported that imidazole rings could undergo hydroxylation at ph 9 10 which is consistent with neutral medetomidine showing higher reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals than the protonated form a slightly higher ratio of reaction rate constants was observed when using nano2 knano2 1 85 0 04 kh2o2 1 74 0 02 figure s5 for the experiments conducted at ph 9 2 which might be attributable to the reaction of no2 with neutral medetomidine and would provide an additional loss process nélieu et al 2004 scholes et al 2019 3 2 4 contributions of reactive species according to eq 4 in section 2 2 7 the expected rate constants of protonated and neutral medetomidine are calculated to be 2 14 0 03 10 7 s 1 and 1 83 0 02 10 5 s 1 respectively moreover using eqs 5 6 described in section 2 2 7 for the degradation of protonated medetomidine the 1o2 mediated reaction was negligible as it was fully attributed to the oh mediated reaction by contrast the 1o2 mediated reaction exhibited the highest contribution for neutral medetomidine accounting for 98 5 while oh mediated reaction contributed the remainder 3 3 identification of phototransformation products four major phototransformation products were detected by hplc uv in the 1o2 mediated reactions three of the photoproducts 5 6 and 10 which showed the largest peak areas on hplc uv were isolated during reaction with 1o2 fig 6 photoproduct 10 had the highest isolated mass whereas photoproducts 5 and 6 had equal peak areas in the lc uv chromatograms their structures were elucidated using nmr and further validated by qtof ms2 spectra interpretation due to insufficient mass for nmr analysis the identification of photoproduct 2 was proposed based on comprehensive interpretation of the ms2 fragmentation the measured ms2 and nmr spectra along with the detailed interpretation are summarized in text s1and s2 photoproduct 2 photoproduct 2 fig 6 is proposed as an intermediate of the formation of products 5 and 6 the detected m z of photoproduct 2 4 1 2 3 dimethylphenyl ethyl 2 hydroperoxy 2 5 dihydro 1h imidazol 5 ol was 251 1403 c13h19n2o3 text s1 s1 1 the major ms2 m z fragments obtained were 173 0970 145 1015 130 0777 and 105 0695 the detected m z 105 0695 c8h9 indicated the structure of 1 2 dimethylbenzene and fragment 145 1015 suggested the formula c11h13 in addition m z 130 0777 c10h10 could be formed by cleavage of the imidazole ring as possible intermediates photoproduct 2 and photoproduct 9 fig 6 had the same theoretical monoisotopic mass however the characteristic fragment m z 173 097 was assigned to the formula of c12h13o complying with the loss of ch4n2o and a water molecule hence this supports the photoproduct 2 structure shown below as the most plausible photoproducts 5 and 6 hplc qtof analysis of 5 and 6 gave an m h ion at m z 233 1318 and 233 1276 respectively text s1 2 1 3 which established a molecular formula of c13h16n2o2 for each product indicating the addition of two oxygen atoms to the parent medetomidine fig 6 1h nmr analysis of 5 5 1 2 3 dimethylphenyl ethyl imidazolidine 2 4 dione showed the loss of the imidazole proton signals h 2 and h 5 and emergence of a deshielded one proton doublet at δ 4 20 h 4 and two broad one proton singlets at δ 4 92 nh 3 and δ 7 19 nh 1 the nmr shift data for h c 6 through h c 15 indicated that this part of the structure i e trimethylbenzyl unit matched that of the parent compound medetomidine the hmbc spectrum figure s12 showed key correlations blue arrows in fig 6 from h 4 to two non protonated sp2 hybridized carbons at δ 155 3 c 2 and δ 172 6 c 5 a methine carbon at δ 37 6 c 6 and a methyl carbon at δ 18 2 c 7 thereby establishing a hydantoin ring fang et al 2011 senior et al 2007 and allowing for the complete structural assignment of 5 aside from minor shift differences the nmr analysis of 6 was completely analogous to that of 5 suggesting the two products are c 4 c 6 diastereomers the detected ms2 spectra of the 5 and 6 diastereomers also display the same fragments texts1 s1 2 and s1 3 the fragment m z of 133 1018 c10h13 was observed and the subsequent loss of methyl groups resulted in the formation of the fragments 91 0546 c7h7 and 105 0704 c8h9 the fragment ions m z of 145 1016 c11h13 and 162 1284 c11h16n showed a loss of c2h4n2o2 and c2hno2 derived from parent ions the characteristic fragment m z 101 035 c3h5n2o2 was formed as an elimination of 1 ethyl 2 3 dimethyl benzene from the parent ions photoproduct 10 hplc qtof analysis of 10 2 2 3 dimethylphenyl propanamide gave an m h ion at m z 178 1227 text s1 4 establishing a molecular formula of c11h15no fig 6 consistent with the loss of c2hn and the addition of an oxygen atom to the parent compound 1h nmr analysis of 10 showed the loss of the imidazole proton signals h 2 and h 5 and emergence of a broad two proton singlet at δ 5 20 nh2 3 analogous to 5 and 6 the nmr shift data for h c 6 through h c 15 of 10 indicated that this part of the structure i e trimethylbenzyl unit matched that of the parent compound the hmbc spectrum figure s20 showed key correlations blue arrows in fig 6 from h 6 and h 7 to an amide carbon at δ 177 0 c 4 together the data are consistent with imidazole ring fragmentation to a primary amide as shown in fig 6 for 10 the same fragments m z 133 1020 105 0703 and 91 0546 were observed as those of the fragments of the photoproducts 5 6 additionally m z 133 1019 c10h13 was measured resulting from the loss of a formamide group ch3no from the parent ion 3 3 1 proposed pathways and formation of photoproducts in simulated natural environment two pathways for the 1o2 mediated reaction of medetomidine were proposed fig 6 based on the chemical structures of the identified photoproducts and the sequence of the photoproducts formation during both uva irradiation and simulated natural sunlight experiments for both pathways 2 5 or 4 5 cycloaddition are presumed to be the first step to form unstable endo peroxide or dioxetane intermediates photoproduct 1 and 7 these processes were previously reported for imidazole containing compounds iesce et al 2005 latch et al 2003 tomita et al 1969 in pathway 1 the endo peroxide would be susceptible to hydrolysis to yield 2 and a subsequent dehydration would lead to the formation of 3 photoproducts 4 5 and 6 are proposed to form from sequential tautomerizations of 3 in pathway 2 photoproduct 8 is proposed to form from ring opening of the dioxetane intermediate 7 intermediate 8 would be susceptible to hydration of the imine group c n to give intermediate 9 and a subsequent elimination of c2h3no2 would yield isolated product 10 since the largest peak area was observed on hplc uv and the highest mass was collected for photoproduct 10 the formation of 10 was considered to be more efficient than photoproduct 5 and 6 and thus it is likely that pathway 2 is favored to investigate the phototransformation of medetomidine in simulated natural conditions the formation peak area vs experimental days of the proposed photoproducts in sunlit coastal water is presented in fig 7 the ph of coastal water was 8 3 higher than the pka of protonated medetomidine therefore fast degradation of medetomidine along with the formation of the previously identified photoproducts are expected in natural conditions the concentration of photoproducts generally increased for the first few days of the experiment when medetomidine degradation was significant after medetomidine was no longer detectable in the waters t 7 days their response areas were relatively stable this indicates that the photoproducts are not as susceptible to photodegradation as the parent compound and are expected to persist in the environment for longer times moreover the transformation products eluted later than medetomidine during reverse phased lc analysis which suggests they are more hydrophobic than medetomidine reported logk ow 2 9 ohlauson et al 2012 previous studies have also found that the transformation products of biocides used for coating facades as is the case for medetomidine accumulated in soils bollmann et al 2017 and leached into groundwater hensen et al 2018 thus sorption and accumulation of medetomidine photoproducts in sediments or soils could occur as well nonetheless verification of these hypotheses will require further studies 4 conclusion this study showed that medetomidine degrades via indirect photolysis in marine environments in contrast it was shown that medetomidine is hydrolytically stable no significant direct photodegradation occurred in di water and considerably slower degradation potentially due to biodegradation processes was observed in dark conditions nonetheless the photochemical behavior of medetomidine is highly dependent on the aquatic environmental conditions such as ph and nom content medetomidine in its neutral state is the predominant form expected in marine waters pka of protonated form 7 2 the neutral form showed high reactivity with singlet oxygen while other reactive species i e hydroxy radicals and triplet state organic matter played a minor to no role the contribution by other water constituents e g halogen radicals and fe2 ions requires further studies similar to other imidazole containing compounds medetomidine undergoes cycloaddition reactions with singlet oxygen and four identified photoproducts for the 1o2 mediated reaction support this hypothesis the chemical structures and properties of these photoproducts have never been reported before but they could become potential contaminants in the marine environment especially because medetomidine degraded rapidly in natural waters and the transformation products showed potential persistence in the aquatic environment medetomidine is known to have negative effects on non target species therefore it is prudent to evaluate the toxicity of its phototransformation products to aquatic organisms to fully understand the environmental fate and potential risk of this biocide the present study on medetomidine showed clearly that the environmental assessment regarding photostability based purely on the evaluation of direct photodegradation potential is insufficient a potential dissipation pathway is neglected and the risk arising from potentially toxic phototransformation products might be

17214,compartmentalization can protect cells from the interference of external toxic substances by sequestering toxic products we hypothesized that proteinaceous nanocompartments may be a feasible candidate material to be added to genetically modified bacteria for the sequestration of toxic environmental products which would open up a new bioremediation pathway here we showed that the model bacterium escherichia coli with self assembling nanocompartments can remove silver ag from water transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray tem edx analysis showed that the nanocompartments combined stably with silver in vitro in addition when exposed to 30 μm agno3 the survival rate of genetically modified bacteria with nanocompartments was 86 while it was just 59 in the wild type bacteria without nanocompartments label free quantitative proteomics indicated that the nanocompartments enhanced bacterial activity by inducing the up regulation of protein processing and secondary metabolites and decreased their intracellular silver concentration both of which contributed to their increased resistance to toxic silver this study on nanocompartments has contributed to a deeper understanding of how bacteria respond to environmental stressors like heavy metal pollutants in water the technology promises to provide a new strategy for recycling heavy metals from sewage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protein cage self assembly bioremediation silver proteomics 1 introduction industrial wastewater releases a large number of harmful heavy metals into the environment including silver ag which can cause great harm to the ecosystem and human health in addition to wasting a valuable resource huang et al 2018 tran thu et al 2019 ag can enter the human body through aquatic organisms which can lead to a variety of diseases as it accumulate cantuaria et al 2016 fung and bowen 1996 song et al 2011 therefore finding a suitable method to remove ag from wastewater is urgently needed which is of great significance for the continuous recovery and treatment of sewage pollutants in this paper we described a new approach for the removal of silver in water using genetically modified bacteria the technology promises to provide a new strategy for recycling heavy metals from sewage as bacteria have evolved they have developed strict procedures and automatic controls for their metabolic system bacteria have a robust molecular regulatory mechanism which can effectively resist changes in the external environment klaus joerger et al 2001 bacteria have also evolved a set of efficient detoxification mechanisms which effectively detoxify heavy metal thus limiting the effect of harmful heavy metal on their life activities rouch et al 1995 silver 1996 in addition bacteria have many interesting biochemical processes and metabolic pathways for example magnetotactic bacteria can be used to remove heavy metals and radionuclides from wastewater bahaj et al 1998 furthermore toxic high valence state heavy metal ions can be reduced to lower valence states making them less harmful he et al 2020 paulsen and saier 1997 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b for example a metal accumulating bacterium can convert ag into the less toxic elemental ag0 using the electron transport system klaus et al 1999 compartmentalization can protect cells from the interference of external toxic substances and protect enzymes in cells from proteolysis nichols et al 2017 both the lipid binding organelles of eukaryotes and the protein containers of prokaryotes have these properties held et al 2013 kerfeld et al 2010 martin 2010 savage et al 2010 schrader et al 2015 protein cages are a common biocompatibility system that has been found in many fields especially as a carrier kramer et al 2004 li and wang 2014 the addition of similar protein cages in genetically modified microorganisms may result in significant improvements in sequestering toxic environmental products therefore we hypothesized that the protein cages may be feasible candidate material to be added to genetically modified bacteria for the sequestration of toxic environmental products there are many examples of compartments in nature such as lipid binding organelles in eukaryotes and protein containers in prokaryotes held et al 2013 kerfeld et al 2010 martin 2010 savage et al 2010 schrader et al 2015 one of the newest types of proteinaceous compartments is the encapsulin nanocompartment which shows great potential for application in nanobiotechnology in previous experiments we used molecular cloning techniques to express the encapsulin proteins of the anammox bacteria ca brocadia fulgida in escherichia coli e coli supporting information fig s1 xing et al 2020 the encapsulin protein was able to self assemble into a nanocompartment within e coli xing et al 2020 in preliminary studies we found that nanocompartments helped the bacteria resist the stress of toxic products such as hydroxylamine xing et al 2020 this agreed with reports that the interior and exterior surfaces of the nanocompartments can be used as toxic attachment points li et al 2011a li et al 2011b therefore we speculated that the nanocompartments can help bacteria resist the stress of other toxic substances such as toxic silver as well in addition to its characteristics and functions evidence has shown that nanocompartments can be easily manipulated through genetic engineering significantly increasing the number of potential applications pokorski and steinmetz 2011 to better understand the protective mechanisms of nanocompartments silver was used as a model toxin in this study transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy tem edx were used to determine whether the nanocompartments were able to combine with silver in vitro next we used surface plasmon resonance imaging spri technology to characterize the kinetic process of the combination of silver with the nanocompartments lastly label free quantitative proteomics was used to reveal the anti heavy metal mechanisms of nanocompartments with high resolution at the protein level this study has increased our understanding of the role that nanocompartments play in reducing cellular stress caused by silver and helps open up a new bioremediation pathway 2 materials and methods 2 1 expression and purification of encapsulin nanocompartments proteins the encapsulin gene cenc ncbi kko18403 1 from anammox bacteria ca brocadia fulgida was cloned into a pet28a to form a fusion plasmid pet28a cenc then the pet28a cenc was transferred into e coli bl21 cells by electroporation detailed methods regarding encapsulin nanocompartments protein expression are given in the supplementary information encapsulin nanocompartments proteins were purified based on previously reported methods giessen and silver 2017 2 2 spr imaging first the right chip was selected and its surface was functionalized supplementary information cleaned chips were submerged in a 3 solution of aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes in ultrapure water for 1 5 min then rinsed with ultrapure water prior to gentle dust free drying in air howarter and youngblood 2006 the coated chip was then cleaned with deionized water and ethanol and dried with nitrogen the processed chip was then placed on the microfluidic device as described in previous relevant reports shan et al 2012 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 a flexiperm reusable well su zhou was mounted on top of the aptes functionalized gold chip and filled with 500 μl of 20 µm agno3 the pump and flow rate regulator of the sample cell microchannel were made of polydimethylsiloxane pdms

using es vision software emispec systems inc tempe usa for tem the preparation process of different bacteria particles is given in the supplementary information 2 4 cell survival test we established two different types of bacteria using genetic and molecular techniques one of them was genetically modified bacteria gmb with nanocompartments and the other was wild type bacteria wb without nanocompartments the wb and gmb were inoculated into improved luria bertani lb medium due to the presence of sodium chloride in normal lb medium chloride ions and silver ions form precipitation which interferes with the experiment so in our experiment sodium hydrogen phosphate replaced sodium chloride the cultures were grown to an od600 of 0 6 for genetically modified bacteria protein production was induced with 0 1 mm isopropyl β d thiogalactoside iptg and the cultures were incubated at 37 c and agitated at 180 rpm for 18 h in the dark the next day the wb and gmb were seeded in a 96 well plate to 104 cfu ml and incubated in improved lb medium with varying concentrations of agno3 0 μm 10 μm 20 μm and 30 μm at 37 c for 12 h in the dark five replicate wells were used for each treatment and experiments were repeated three times 2 5 determination of the cell growth curve the wb and gmb were inoculated in improved lb medium during phase i cultures were grown to an od600 of 0 6 in phase ii for genetically modified bacteria protein production was induced with 0 1 mm iptg then 120 µm agno3 was added into the improved lb medium for wild type bacteria one group had 0 µm agno3 added to the culture medium and the other group had 120 µm agno3 added the cultures were incubated 37 c 180 rpm for 1 5 h in the dark the concentrations of the bacterial cultures were measured every half hour this experiment was repeated three times meanwhile the concentration of silver was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms after the experiment the bacteria were collected for tem analysis 2 6 lc ms ms proteomic analysis the total proteins of the e coli were evaluated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page proteins were extracted and digested according to a previously published method peng et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 yin et al 2015 detailed information is given in the supplementary information 3 results 3 1 nanocompartments combine with silver in vitro a general feature of nanocompartments is their high stability which enables them to endure in culture supernatants rosenkrands et al 1998 valdesstauber and scherer 1994 an encapsulin nanocompartment resembles a virus capsid in terms of its mechanical properties in order to determine whether the nanocompartments can combine with silver we incubated the purified nanocompartments with silver ions ag in vitro it was found that the nanocompartments did combine with silver appearing darker than nanocompartments without silver when observed by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1 a and b energy dispersive x ray edx analysis also detected silver in the nanocompartments fig 1c d and e confirming that a single nanocompartment can stably combine with silver in vitro 3 2 agglomeration dispersion of nanocompartment combined with silver we have shown that nanocompartments can combine with silver but the process of combination cannot be dynamically observed so we used spri which is an unlabeled in situ detection technique campbell and kim 2007 homola 2008 yao et al 2008 to quantify the agglomeration of nanocompartments and silver spri was conducted using a high aperture optical objective wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 the schematic diagram of spri was shown in supporting information fig s2 supporting information fig s3 shows that when nanocompartments and silver combined they attached to the coated sensor chip but the nanocompartments without silver did not attach to the surface of the chip consistent with the results shown in fig 1 the nanocompartments can bind silver in vitro fig 2 a and b show the transmission and plasmonic images of the nanocompartment particles with silver the plasma image is v shape different light intensity positions in the image show different colors the color bar normalized the light intensity with the display range from 0 to 1 it has been reported that the stability of a nanocompartment is dependent on the ph of its environment valdesstauber and scherer 1994 the nanocompartment particles seemed to be stable at ph 5 9 which is in agreement with the previous reports supporting information fig s4 putri et al 2017 rahmanpour and bugg 2013 in our system the nanocompartment particles were able to attach to the surface but were also allowed to agglomerate disperse so the buffer ph was reduced from 7 to 4 and the particles were incubated for 750 min fig 2c shown the agglomeration dispersion information of the nanocompartment particles combined with silver at ph 7 the spri signal increased over time which was likely caused by the combination of the nanocompartments with silver the nanocompartments landed on the surface of the sensor chip resulting in the increased spri signal when the ph of the solution was changed to 4 the spri signal decreased over time suggesting that the nanocompartment particles were dispersing in order to provide further evidence supporting our hypothesis the surface of the sensor chip was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem edx the measured points included nanocompartment particles as well as other sections of the sensor chip fig 2d and e empty encapsulin nanocompartments could not be observed by sem it was found that there was silver where there were nanocompartment particles but sections without nanocompartments did not has silver 3 3 use of model organism with nanocompartment for silver removal our experiments have shown that the nanocompartments were able to combine with silver in vitro but it is not known whether they can combine with silver in normal bacteria so we used e coli as a model organism to explore the functions of nanocompartments in removing silver the process of silver ions binding to e coli bl21 that were immobilized on the surface of the sensor chip was imaged using the surface plasmon resonance microscope supporting information fig s5 shows that the schematic diagram of e coli bl21 cells were tethered to the sensor chip fig 3 a and b show the transmission and plasmonic images of the bacterial cells the v shape formed by a single bacteria matches the position of the bacteria in the optical image wang et al 2010 then the effects of silver ions on e coli bl21 was studied by adding agno3 final concentration 20 µμ to test whether the nanocompartments were effective in bacteria we passed a solution of agno3 through the bacteria wb gmb at a rate of 3 μl s for about 1000 s with the addition of silver ions the image intensity of the bacteria increased significantly the intensity of the image signal was proportional to the mass density of the sensor surface so the data showed that silver was absorbed by the bacteria cells importantly there was a significant difference between the image intensities of gmb and wb fig 3c which indicated that the nanocompartments placed in normal bacteria were able to combine with silver it has been reported that silver can damage cell membranes and dna by producing reactive oxygen species ros said et al 2014 we speculated that gmb could tolerate a higher concentration of silver than wb to verify this we investigated the effects of nanocompartments on the survival of e coli under stress caused by silver exposure shown in fig 3d as the concentration of silver increased the bacterial survival rate decreased when exposed to 30 μm agno3 the survival rate of gmb was 86 while wb s survival rate was 59 which suggested that gmb had a higher resistance to silver than wb 3 4 the possible mechanisms by which genetically modified bacteria remove silver using nanocompartments to further explore the function of nanocompartments in bacteria the effects of nanocompartments on the growth curve of e coli experiencing silver caused stress was investigated as shown in fig 4 a the beginning of phase i the growth curves of e coli from all groups were similar however in phase ii following dosing with silver ions wb 0 µm agno3 wb gmb 0 µm agno3 gmb wb 120 µm agno3 wb ag and gmb 120 µm agno3 gmb ag the optical density in wb ag and gmb ag were lower than that in wb and gmb fig 4a the growth curve of gmb is no different from that of wb in the presence of no silver notably when both were exposed to silver ions the optical density of the genetically modified bacteria was higher than the wild type bacteria which is consistent with our previous result the survival rate of gmb is higher than wb as predicted the encapsulin protein about 42 kda was found to be highly expressed in a band from the genetically modified bacteria when analyzed by sds page supporting information fig s6 and we found that the gmb were able to remove more silver than the wb in a short time supporting information fig s7 these results support the hypothesis that nanocompartments help bacteria reduce the concentration of silver from aqueous solution high throughput proteomics was used to get a comprehensive picture of the proteomic changes in the wb wb ag and gmb ag groups there was no difference in growth curve between wb and gmb groups so no proteomic analysis was performed in gmb group as shown in fig 4b a total of 2679 2680 and 2653 proteins were expressed in wb wb ag and gmb ag respectively among them 2440 proteins were shared by all three groups suggesting that the majority of the proteins didn t change among the three groups in order to clarify the function of differentially expressed proteins in wb wb ag and gmb ag gene ontology go annotation analysis was used to analyze the quantified proteins go annotation analysis included biological processes cellular components and molecular functions as shown in fig 4c and d in the biological process category many of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in cellular processes metabolic processes and single organism processes it indicated that silver ions can inhibit many catabolic processes and some biosynthetic processes in bacteria these results suggested that silver ions have intrinsic functions as toxic metals in terms of cellular components a large number of the up regulated proteins were from cell parts intriguingly up regulated proteins not down regulated proteins were more commonly associated with cell membrane components in e coli it has been found that silver ions affect membrane proteins leading to cell lysis marambio jones and hoek 2010 in terms of molecular functions the up regulated proteins and down regulated proteins were mainly concentrated in catalytic activity and binding suggesting that differentially expressed proteins were involved in protein processing we then performed a go enrichment analysis of up regulated proteins between specific groups i e wb ag vs wb and gmb ag vs wb as shown in fig 5 a and b we saw that the go terms structural constituent of ribosome and integral component of plasma membrane were significantly enriched among the up regulated proteins in wb ag vs wb these results suggested that wild type bacteria responded to the silver stress by increasing the expression of ribosome associated proteins and membrane proteins without success we then found that the go terms single organism transport and integral component of plasma membrane were significantly enriched among the up regulated proteins in gmb ag vs wb interestingly the go term single organism transport was significantly enriched in gmb ag vs wb but not in wb ag vs wb these results indicated that genetically modified bacteria likely have other ways of regulating silver ion stress ways which have been proven successful therefore we hypothesized that nanocompartments induced the up regulation of transporter proteins in bacteria thus helping to transport silver ions out of cells thereby reducing silver ion stress we then subjected the up regulated proteins identified in wb ag vs wb and gmb ag vs wb to kegg pathway enrichment analyses among the enriched kegg pathways from wb ag vs wb we identified 5 significantly enriched metabolic pathways p 0 05 including the ribosome protein export bacterial secretion system phosphotransferase system and oxidative phosphorylation fig 6 a of the 12 significantly enriched metabolic pathways from gmb ag vs wb 5 were shared with wb ag vs wb and 7 were unique fig 6b therefore those 7 metabolic pathways may be crucial in helping bacteria resist silver ions those 7 metabolic pathways were fatty acid degradation valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis butanoate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pantothenate and coa biosynthesis caprolactam degradation and limonene and pinene degradation these results indicated that detoxification was associated with protein processing and secondary metabolites 4 discussion 4 1 silver ions may enter the nanocompartments through pores in nature there are several proteins that are able to carry or sequester metal ions and minerals as reported by n dennis chasteen a multi subunit protein shell can store iron chasteen and harrison 1999 for the protein shell to transport metal ions and small organic molecules small channels located in the protein shell are required chasteen 1998 sutter reported that the nanocompartment of thermotoga maritima was a thin icosahedral shell that consisted of 60 units sutter et al 2008 and that the interior of the nanocompartment contained conservative binding sites in this study we have shown that nanocompartments do indeed serve as a platform for the absorption of heavy metal ions the experiments presented in this paper by transferring nanocompartments into e coli genetically modified bacteria and dosing with silver ions demonstrated that nanocompartments can combine with silver ions in vitro similar structural analyses of nanocompartments from thermotoga maritima and pyrococcus furiosus have also shown that capsids have multiple pores that can control the exchange of small molecules akita et al 2007 sutter et al 2008 these small openings likely serve as a permeability barrier against larger molecules while permitting the transit of small molecules and ions through the shell nichols et al 2017 we hypothesized that the silver ions like the small molecules and ions mentioned above might have entered the nanocompartments through pores interestingly we also found that the nanocompartments can combine with other metal ions such as zinc supporting information fig s8 as detoxifiers of nanomaterials the characteristics of the outer and inner surfaces of nanocompartments must be fully utilized li et al 2011a li et al 2011b nanocompartments can be easily manipulated by genetic means resulting in a large number of diverse and complex potential applications pokorski and steinmetz 2011 expanding upon the ability of nanocompartments to combine with metal ions we speculate that they may be applied as detoxicants with the potential to be developed into detoxification materials and drug carriers for use in industry and pharmaceuticals 4 2 nanocompartment can combine with silver in bacteria in this study we observed that silver reduced the growth of e coli bacteria fig 4a interestingly we saw that genetically modified bacteria had higher survival rates than wild type bacteria indicating that nanocompartments increased bacterial resistance to silver stress previous studies have reported that silver reduce cell activity by inducing ros production in cells or by directly destroying cell membranes marambio jones and hoek 2010 paulsen reported that bacteria may reduce high valence state metal ions to a zero valence state to alleviate the heavy metal stress paulsen and saier 1997 our results suggested that the nanocompartments combine with the silver effectively reducing the concentration of free silver in the cell and protecting the cell this may be a new way for bacteria to respond to environmental metal ion stress in order to further verify our hypothesis the cell membrane of bacteria exposed to the pressure of silver ions was observed by tem and it was found that the cell membrane of wb was basically lyzed while the gmb cell membrane was less damaged and remained intact fig 7 4 3 mechanisms by which nanocompartments may increase silver stress resistance moreover our study has provided a comprehensive look at cellular responses to silver stress in wild type and genetically modified bacteria at the proteomic level and we saw changes in the ribosome protein export system and the phosphotransferase system to name a few in agreement with previous findings gupta et al 1999 some complexes were even able to transport ag from the inside to the outside of the cell consistent with previous reports wang et al 2019 we also found that a number of enzymes that metabolize fatty acids were up regulated only in the genetically modified bacteria these enzymes included the fatty acid oxidation complex fadb 3 ketoacyl coa thiolase fada fadi and long chain fatty acid coa ligase fadd supplementary excel file additional file 2 interestingly in contrast with previous findings and the notion that the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and the adaptive oxalate pathway are suppressed in response to silver stress wang et al 2019 we detected the up regulation of numerous proteins involved in secondary metabolites and protein processing but only in the genetically modified bacteria so while silver exposure may still increase bacteria ros production and membrane permeability in the presence of nanocompartments bacteria may be able to up regulate protein processing and secondary metabolites and thereby decrease the intracellular silver concentration and toxicity fig 8 this study of nanocompartments has increased the depth of our understanding of how bacteria adapt to environmental stress and further helps to understand how bacteria deal with heavy metal pollutants in water in addition nanocompartments can be imported into functional bacteria by

17214,compartmentalization can protect cells from the interference of external toxic substances by sequestering toxic products we hypothesized that proteinaceous nanocompartments may be a feasible candidate material to be added to genetically modified bacteria for the sequestration of toxic environmental products which would open up a new bioremediation pathway here we showed that the model bacterium escherichia coli with self assembling nanocompartments can remove silver ag from water transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray tem edx analysis showed that the nanocompartments combined stably with silver in vitro in addition when exposed to 30 μm agno3 the survival rate of genetically modified bacteria with nanocompartments was 86 while it was just 59 in the wild type bacteria without nanocompartments label free quantitative proteomics indicated that the nanocompartments enhanced bacterial activity by inducing the up regulation of protein processing and secondary metabolites and decreased their intracellular silver concentration both of which contributed to their increased resistance to toxic silver this study on nanocompartments has contributed to a deeper understanding of how bacteria respond to environmental stressors like heavy metal pollutants in water the technology promises to provide a new strategy for recycling heavy metals from sewage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protein cage self assembly bioremediation silver proteomics 1 introduction industrial wastewater releases a large number of harmful heavy metals into the environment including silver ag which can cause great harm to the ecosystem and human health in addition to wasting a valuable resource huang et al 2018 tran thu et al 2019 ag can enter the human body through aquatic organisms which can lead to a variety of diseases as it accumulate cantuaria et al 2016 fung and bowen 1996 song et al 2011 therefore finding a suitable method to remove ag from wastewater is urgently needed which is of great significance for the continuous recovery and treatment of sewage pollutants in this paper we described a new approach for the removal of silver in water using genetically modified bacteria the technology promises to provide a new strategy for recycling heavy metals from sewage as bacteria have evolved they have developed strict procedures and automatic controls for their metabolic system bacteria have a robust molecular regulatory mechanism which can effectively resist changes in the external environment klaus joerger et al 2001 bacteria have also evolved a set of efficient detoxification mechanisms which effectively detoxify heavy metal thus limiting the effect of harmful heavy metal on their life activities rouch et al 1995 silver 1996 in addition bacteria have many interesting biochemical processes and metabolic pathways for example magnetotactic bacteria can be used to remove heavy metals and radionuclides from wastewater bahaj et al 1998 furthermore toxic high valence state heavy metal ions can be reduced to lower valence states making them less harmful he et al 2020 paulsen and saier 1997 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b for example a metal accumulating bacterium can convert ag into the less toxic elemental ag0 using the electron transport system klaus et al 1999 compartmentalization can protect cells from the interference of external toxic substances and protect enzymes in cells from proteolysis nichols et al 2017 both the lipid binding organelles of eukaryotes and the protein containers of prokaryotes have these properties held et al 2013 kerfeld et al 2010 martin 2010 savage et al 2010 schrader et al 2015 protein cages are a common biocompatibility system that has been found in many fields especially as a carrier kramer et al 2004 li and wang 2014 the addition of similar protein cages in genetically modified microorganisms may result in significant improvements in sequestering toxic environmental products therefore we hypothesized that the protein cages may be feasible candidate material to be added to genetically modified bacteria for the sequestration of toxic environmental products there are many examples of compartments in nature such as lipid binding organelles in eukaryotes and protein containers in prokaryotes held et al 2013 kerfeld et al 2010 martin 2010 savage et al 2010 schrader et al 2015 one of the newest types of proteinaceous compartments is the encapsulin nanocompartment which shows great potential for application in nanobiotechnology in previous experiments we used molecular cloning techniques to express the encapsulin proteins of the anammox bacteria ca brocadia fulgida in escherichia coli e coli supporting information fig s1 xing et al 2020 the encapsulin protein was able to self assemble into a nanocompartment within e coli xing et al 2020 in preliminary studies we found that nanocompartments helped the bacteria resist the stress of toxic products such as hydroxylamine xing et al 2020 this agreed with reports that the interior and exterior surfaces of the nanocompartments can be used as toxic attachment points li et al 2011a li et al 2011b therefore we speculated that the nanocompartments can help bacteria resist the stress of other toxic substances such as toxic silver as well in addition to its characteristics and functions evidence has shown that nanocompartments can be easily manipulated through genetic engineering significantly increasing the number of potential applications pokorski and steinmetz 2011 to better understand the protective mechanisms of nanocompartments silver was used as a model toxin in this study transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy tem edx were used to determine whether the nanocompartments were able to combine with silver in vitro next we used surface plasmon resonance imaging spri technology to characterize the kinetic process of the combination of silver with the nanocompartments lastly label free quantitative proteomics was used to reveal the anti heavy metal mechanisms of nanocompartments with high resolution at the protein level this study has increased our understanding of the role that nanocompartments play in reducing cellular stress caused by silver and helps open up a new bioremediation pathway 2 materials and methods 2 1 expression and purification of encapsulin nanocompartments proteins the encapsulin gene cenc ncbi kko18403 1 from anammox bacteria ca brocadia fulgida was cloned into a pet28a to form a fusion plasmid pet28a cenc then the pet28a cenc was transferred into e coli bl21 cells by electroporation detailed methods regarding encapsulin nanocompartments protein expression are given in the supplementary information encapsulin nanocompartments proteins were purified based on previously reported methods giessen and silver 2017 2 2 spr imaging first the right chip was selected and its surface was functionalized supplementary information cleaned chips were submerged in a 3 solution of aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes in ultrapure water for 1 5 min then rinsed with ultrapure water prior to gentle dust free drying in air howarter and youngblood 2006 the coated chip was then cleaned with deionized water and ethanol and dried with nitrogen the processed chip was then placed on the microfluidic device as described in previous relevant reports shan et al 2012 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 a flexiperm reusable well su zhou was mounted on top of the aptes functionalized gold chip and filled with 500 μl of 20 µm agno3 the pump and flow rate regulator of the sample cell microchannel were made of polydimethylsiloxane pdms

using es vision software emispec systems inc tempe usa for tem the preparation process of different bacteria particles is given in the supplementary information 2 4 cell survival test we established two different types of bacteria using genetic and molecular techniques one of them was genetically modified bacteria gmb with nanocompartments and the other was wild type bacteria wb without nanocompartments the wb and gmb were inoculated into improved luria bertani lb medium due to the presence of sodium chloride in normal lb medium chloride ions and silver ions form precipitation which interferes with the experiment so in our experiment sodium hydrogen phosphate replaced sodium chloride the cultures were grown to an od600 of 0 6 for genetically modified bacteria protein production was induced with 0 1 mm isopropyl β d thiogalactoside iptg and the cultures were incubated at 37 c and agitated at 180 rpm for 18 h in the dark the next day the wb and gmb were seeded in a 96 well plate to 104 cfu ml and incubated in improved lb medium with varying concentrations of agno3 0 μm 10 μm 20 μm and 30 μm at 37 c for 12 h in the dark five replicate wells were used for each treatment and experiments were repeated three times 2 5 determination of the cell growth curve the wb and gmb were inoculated in improved lb medium during phase i cultures were grown to an od600 of 0 6 in phase ii for genetically modified bacteria protein production was induced with 0 1 mm iptg then 120 µm agno3 was added into the improved lb medium for wild type bacteria one group had 0 µm agno3 added to the culture medium and the other group had 120 µm agno3 added the cultures were incubated 37 c 180 rpm for 1 5 h in the dark the concentrations of the bacterial cultures were measured every half hour this experiment was repeated three times meanwhile the concentration of silver was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms after the experiment the bacteria were collected for tem analysis 2 6 lc ms ms proteomic analysis the total proteins of the e coli were evaluated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page proteins were extracted and digested according to a previously published method peng et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 yin et al 2015 detailed information is given in the supplementary information 3 results 3 1 nanocompartments combine with silver in vitro a general feature of nanocompartments is their high stability which enables them to endure in culture supernatants rosenkrands et al 1998 valdesstauber and scherer 1994 an encapsulin nanocompartment resembles a virus capsid in terms of its mechanical properties in order to determine whether the nanocompartments can combine with silver we incubated the purified nanocompartments with silver ions ag in vitro it was found that the nanocompartments did combine with silver appearing darker than nanocompartments without silver when observed by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1 a and b energy dispersive x ray edx analysis also detected silver in the nanocompartments fig 1c d and e confirming that a single nanocompartment can stably combine with silver in vitro 3 2 agglomeration dispersion of nanocompartment combined with silver we have shown that nanocompartments can combine with silver but the process of combination cannot be dynamically observed so we used spri which is an unlabeled in situ detection technique campbell and kim 2007 homola 2008 yao et al 2008 to quantify the agglomeration of nanocompartments and silver spri was conducted using a high aperture optical objective wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 the schematic diagram of spri was shown in supporting information fig s2 supporting information fig s3 shows that when nanocompartments and silver combined they attached to the coated sensor chip but the nanocompartments without silver did not attach to the surface of the chip consistent with the results shown in fig 1 the nanocompartments can bind silver in vitro fig 2 a and b show the transmission and plasmonic images of the nanocompartment particles with silver the plasma image is v shape different light intensity positions in the image show different colors the color bar normalized the light intensity with the display range from 0 to 1 it has been reported that the stability of a nanocompartment is dependent on the ph of its environment valdesstauber and scherer 1994 the nanocompartment particles seemed to be stable at ph 5 9 which is in agreement with the previous reports supporting information fig s4 putri et al 2017 rahmanpour and bugg 2013 in our system the nanocompartment particles were able to attach to the surface but were also allowed to agglomerate disperse so the buffer ph was reduced from 7 to 4 and the particles were incubated for 750 min fig 2c shown the agglomeration dispersion information of the nanocompartment particles combined with silver at ph 7 the spri signal increased over time which was likely caused by the combination of the nanocompartments with silver the nanocompartments landed on the surface of the sensor chip resulting in the increased spri signal when the ph of the solution was changed to 4 the spri signal decreased over time suggesting that the nanocompartment particles were dispersing in order to provide further evidence supporting our hypothesis the surface of the sensor chip was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem edx the measured points included nanocompartment particles as well as other sections of the sensor chip fig 2d and e empty encapsulin nanocompartments could not be observed by sem it was found that there was silver where there were nanocompartment particles but sections without nanocompartments did not has silver 3 3 use of model organism with nanocompartment for silver removal our experiments have shown that the nanocompartments were able to combine with silver in vitro but it is not known whether they can combine with silver in normal bacteria so we used e coli as a model organism to explore the functions of nanocompartments in removing silver the process of silver ions binding to e coli bl21 that were immobilized on the surface of the sensor chip was imaged using the surface plasmon resonance microscope supporting information fig s5 shows that the schematic diagram of e coli bl21 cells were tethered to the sensor chip fig 3 a and b show the transmission and plasmonic images of the bacterial cells the v shape formed by a single bacteria matches the position of the bacteria in the optical image wang et al 2010 then the effects of silver ions on e coli bl21 was studied by adding agno3 final concentration 20 µμ to test whether the nanocompartments were effective in bacteria we passed a solution of agno3 through the bacteria wb gmb at a rate of 3 μl s for about 1000 s with the addition of silver ions the image intensity of the bacteria increased significantly the intensity of the image signal was proportional to the mass density of the sensor surface so the data showed that silver was absorbed by the bacteria cells importantly there was a significant difference between the image intensities of gmb and wb fig 3c which indicated that the nanocompartments placed in normal bacteria were able to combine with silver it has been reported that silver can damage cell membranes and dna by producing reactive oxygen species ros said et al 2014 we speculated that gmb could tolerate a higher concentration of silver than wb to verify this we investigated the effects of nanocompartments on the survival of e coli under stress caused by silver exposure shown in fig 3d as the concentration of silver increased the bacterial survival rate decreased when exposed to 30 μm agno3 the survival rate of gmb was 86 while wb s survival rate was 59 which suggested that gmb had a higher resistance to silver than wb 3 4 the possible mechanisms by which genetically modified bacteria remove silver using nanocompartments to further explore the function of nanocompartments in bacteria the effects of nanocompartments on the growth curve of e coli experiencing silver caused stress was investigated as shown in fig 4 a the beginning of phase i the growth curves of e coli from all groups were similar however in phase ii following dosing with silver ions wb 0 µm agno3 wb gmb 0 µm agno3 gmb wb 120 µm agno3 wb ag and gmb 120 µm agno3 gmb ag the optical density in wb ag and gmb ag were lower than that in wb and gmb fig 4a the growth curve of gmb is no different from that of wb in the presence of no silver notably when both were exposed to silver ions the optical density of the genetically modified bacteria was higher than the wild type bacteria which is consistent with our previous result the survival rate of gmb is higher than wb as predicted the encapsulin protein about 42 kda was found to be highly expressed in a band from the genetically modified bacteria when analyzed by sds page supporting information fig s6 and we found that the gmb were able to remove more silver than the wb in a short time supporting information fig s7 these results support the hypothesis that nanocompartments help bacteria reduce the concentration of silver from aqueous solution high throughput proteomics was used to get a comprehensive picture of the proteomic changes in the wb wb ag and gmb ag groups there was no difference in growth curve between wb and gmb groups so no proteomic analysis was performed in gmb group as shown in fig 4b a total of 2679 2680 and 2653 proteins were expressed in wb wb ag and gmb ag respectively among them 2440 proteins were shared by all three groups suggesting that the majority of the proteins didn t change among the three groups in order to clarify the function of differentially expressed proteins in wb wb ag and gmb ag gene ontology go annotation analysis was used to analyze the quantified proteins go annotation analysis included biological processes cellular components and molecular functions as shown in fig 4c and d in the biological process category many of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in cellular processes metabolic processes and single organism processes it indicated that silver ions can inhibit many catabolic processes and some biosynthetic processes in bacteria these results suggested that silver ions have intrinsic functions as toxic metals in terms of cellular components a large number of the up regulated proteins were from cell parts intriguingly up regulated proteins not down regulated proteins were more commonly associated with cell membrane components in e coli it has been found that silver ions affect membrane proteins leading to cell lysis marambio jones and hoek 2010 in terms of molecular functions the up regulated proteins and down regulated proteins were mainly concentrated in catalytic activity and binding suggesting that differentially expressed proteins were involved in protein processing we then performed a go enrichment analysis of up regulated proteins between specific groups i e wb ag vs wb and gmb ag vs wb as shown in fig 5 a and b we saw that the go terms structural constituent of ribosome and integral component of plasma membrane were significantly enriched among the up regulated proteins in wb ag vs wb these results suggested that wild type bacteria responded to the silver stress by increasing the expression of ribosome associated proteins and membrane proteins without success we then found that the go terms single organism transport and integral component of plasma membrane were significantly enriched among the up regulated proteins in gmb ag vs wb interestingly the go term single organism transport was significantly enriched in gmb ag vs wb but not in wb ag vs wb these results indicated that genetically modified bacteria likely have other ways of regulating silver ion stress ways which have been proven successful therefore we hypothesized that nanocompartments induced the up regulation of transporter proteins in bacteria thus helping to transport silver ions out of cells thereby reducing silver ion stress we then subjected the up regulated proteins identified in wb ag vs wb and gmb ag vs wb to kegg pathway enrichment analyses among the enriched kegg pathways from wb ag vs wb we identified 5 significantly enriched metabolic pathways p 0 05 including the ribosome protein export bacterial secretion system phosphotransferase system and oxidative phosphorylation fig 6 a of the 12 significantly enriched metabolic pathways from gmb ag vs wb 5 were shared with wb ag vs wb and 7 were unique fig 6b therefore those 7 metabolic pathways may be crucial in helping bacteria resist silver ions those 7 metabolic pathways were fatty acid degradation valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis butanoate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pantothenate and coa biosynthesis caprolactam degradation and limonene and pinene degradation these results indicated that detoxification was associated with protein processing and secondary metabolites 4 discussion 4 1 silver ions may enter the nanocompartments through pores in nature there are several proteins that are able to carry or sequester metal ions and minerals as reported by n dennis chasteen a multi subunit protein shell can store iron chasteen and harrison 1999 for the protein shell to transport metal ions and small organic molecules small channels located in the protein shell are required chasteen 1998 sutter reported that the nanocompartment of thermotoga maritima was a thin icosahedral shell that consisted of 60 units sutter et al 2008 and that the interior of the nanocompartment contained conservative binding sites in this study we have shown that nanocompartments do indeed serve as a platform for the absorption of heavy metal ions the experiments presented in this paper by transferring nanocompartments into e coli genetically modified bacteria and dosing with silver ions demonstrated that nanocompartments can combine with silver ions in vitro similar structural analyses of nanocompartments from thermotoga maritima and pyrococcus furiosus have also shown that capsids have multiple pores that can control the exchange of small molecules akita et al 2007 sutter et al 2008 these small openings likely serve as a permeability barrier against larger molecules while permitting the transit of small molecules and ions through the shell nichols et al 2017 we hypothesized that the silver ions like the small molecules and ions mentioned above might have entered the nanocompartments through pores interestingly we also found that the nanocompartments can combine with other
