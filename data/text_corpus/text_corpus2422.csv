12110,identification of hydraulically potential lineaments directly from lineament map required for studies of groundwater resource development in crystalline metamorphosed rock terrain which is considered as a poor groundwater province area is a big challenge lineament study from satellite image gives all available lineaments present in the location including the hydraulically potential lineaments but there are no existing methods present at our disposal which can detect only the hydraulically potential lineaments this study attempts to delineate the hydraulically significant lineaments those are actively promoting groundwater flow in purulia district west bengal ne india where the exposed rock types are porphyritic granite gneisses quartzite mica schist garnetiferous sillimanite biotite schist and phyllite using set theory for the study standard fcc image setup has been used to view the satellite imagery on computer screen within erdas imagine software and lineaments are examined visually on screen without taking any print out of the map the azimuth directions of the lineaments are diagrammed using georient software azimuth rose diagrams of the trend of foliation planes and fracture planes obtained from direct measurement at rock exposures are compared with the lineament trends to yield hydraulically significant lineaments concordant to the trends of hydraulically significant fractures hydraulically significant lineaments are filtered from the total lineament map by using the laws of set theory like universal set sub set union intersection subtraction and equality validation of the obtained result with ground truth reveals that intense deformation of brittle rocks that allow fluid movement have a significant role in the development of hydraulically significant lineaments this study successfully distinguishes the hydraulically significant lineaments exhibiting a directional concurrence to hydraulically significant fractures implying

technique set theory precambrian rocks 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valued natural assets it is one of the nation s most important resources it supports human health and used in rural households for irrigation for commercial businesses and industries but it is very difficult to detect in the hard rock terrain it is an established fact that occurrence of groundwater its source and movement in any hard rock aquifer system broadly depends on lithology rock structure rock thickness and it s permeability which is further increased in weather beaten regions preeja et al 2011 banks et al 2002 in such a hard rock terrain the main type of porosity is secondary and the likes of joint planes fractures shear zones fault planes are established as secondary porosity and the lineaments are surface expressions of these structural features gupta 1991 higher fracture densities closely spaced fractures with high fracture frequency are interrelated with higher rock permeability thus greater yield from wells magowe and carr 1999 acharya and basumallick 2012 mabee and hardcastle 1997 acharya et al 2012 braathen 1999 henriksen and braathen 2006 as mentioned all this fracture zones faults joints fissures pipes dykes appear as lineaments on satellite imagery as in remote sensing lineaments are defined as linear arrangements present on images and those are the most common features which clearly appear on airborne and space images taken from higher elevation gupta 1991 because of that recently a large number of scientists have started the use of remote sensing and gis methods to delineate lineaments lineament junctions which proves to be great channels for groundwater flow to eventually locate potential groundwater zones mohana and muthusamy 2019 oyedele 2019 shimpi et al

investigation and delineation of excellent and non natural groundwater recharge sites as those liniments are direct representation of rock structures which promotes underground water infiltration for few kilometres in crystalline hard rock zones krishnamurthy 2000 edet 1998 presence of lineaments higher lineament density provides a sign of storage and movement of groundwater and greatly increases the potential of groundwater in that area ganapuram et al 2009 sener et al 2005 although the presence of lineaments and how they are related to good groundwater provinces is clear there exists a knowledge gap of only hydraulically important lineaments and procedure to extract them hydraulically significant fractures appearing as lineaments must have water flowing capacities which are absent in other fractures already established study specifies high fracture frequencies and fracture aperture facilitates good groundwater flow thus generating lineaments in satellite image high fracture frequency as stated by several researchers means a great number of fractures present in a narrow space creating greater fracture linkage and a network that enhances permeability thus improves transmissivity of bed rocks mabee and hardcastle 1997 acharya and basumallik 2012 boutt et al 2010 braathen 1999 henriksen and braathen 2006 basically the higher the fracture frequency the closer the fractures will be aligned with each other and that facilitates enhance weathering forming fracture correlated lineaments which are hydraulically significant in old metamorphosed rocks acharya et al 2012 acharya and basumallik 2012 also high fracture apertures are vital to establish a fracture as hydraulically significant as demonstrated by many publications permeability of a set of fractures greatly rest on its density its interconnection which creates connected larger aperture channels typically larger than 5 mm and that increases hydraulic significance of a naturally fractured system singhal and gupta 2010 bertels et al 2001 yeo et al 1998 acharya et al 2014 an overall reduction in hydraulic conductivity is seen in hard fractured rock system due to hydraulic aperture s size drop rutqvist et al 1998 thus higher hydraulic significance of any hard fractured rock system is established by higher fracture frequencies and high fracture aperture and such fractures are expected to generate lineaments so a technique is required to extract those hydraulically significant lineaments this analysis aims to extract the only lineaments responsible for good groundwater flow directly from the whole lineament map of a location with the help of set theory in purulia district fig 1 of west bengal ne india purulia is a plateau region made of hard metamorphosed crystalline rocks i e quartz biotite granite gneiss porphyroblastic granite gneiss mica schist garnetiferous sillimanite biotite schist phyllite and quartzite of proterozoic age along with some amphibolites hornblende schists epidiorite baidya 1992 gupta and basu 2000 biswas and sharma 2016 bisai 2019 in the northern part of cggc there are reported numerous mafic dykes trending ne sw and also in paharpur area of purulia dolerite dykes with similar trend has been reported gogoi et al 2018 mandal et al 2012 purulia also falls under the semi arid tropical climate province with low rainfall thus prone to drought and shows intense physical and chemical weathering bisai 2019 banik et al 2002 gour et al 2014 2 methodology 2 1 visual interpretation of satellite imagery by visually analysing the data from irs p6 liss iv standard fcc photographs lineaments have been identified standard fcc image of the study was prepared using erdas imagine software and visual interpretation was done directly on computer screen without taking any print out lineament interpretation is done visually by opening the satellite imagery on screen and lineaments were marked using line option under vector tools on a new vector layer of lineament lineaments simply appear as straight lines in the plane of 1 50 000 scale out of all the lineaments simply geological lineaments are taken for the study by comparing them with toposheet features of the same area all the non geological lineaments were rejected after ground truth authentication lineaments have been identified by visual analysis of satellite imagery and by spotting the lineaments on the basis of their texture tonal variation of soil vegetation linear features of topography and drainage patterns lillesand 1989 drury 1990 gupta 1991 any non structural or false lineaments have been removed by matching the lineament maps with equivalent toposheets of that area and by field verification leaving the geologic lineaments and entire lineament distribution map of the study area is generated fig 2 all the lineaments are then measured using a goniometer table 1 to get their direction 2 2 major lineament identification all the attitudes of lineaments measured via goniometer were plotted in georient software to create azimuth rose diagrams for all the field locations or waypoints a comparative study of azimuth rose diagrams gave us the visual representation of lineament directions only those which are dominating so now only dominating lineament directions from lineament map is available as shown in fig 3 field study has been conducted data was collected from five different waypoints wp1 wp5 shown in fig 1 and foliation planes joint planes has been measured wp1 is present at north east part of the district near ledasan wp2 and wp3 are present in northern part near biltora and near chas road railway station respectively of the district wp4 and wp5 both are present in southern part of the district where the latter one at extreme south eastern part wp4 is present close to bara mamro and wp5 is in beldih the azimuth rose diagrams of mentioned lineaments foliation planes and joint planes are shown in fig 3 waypoint wise all the major directions which are visible from the rose diagrams in fig 3 are tabled in table 3 there are two distinct sets of lineaments have been observed by analysing rose diagrams produced from data which was measured from lineament map by using goniometer one of those lineament set is caused by regional foliation of the study area which can be seen by comparing the rose diagrams created from lineaments from satellite imagery and measured foliation data of field taken from the same area fig 3 there is another group of lineaments present somewhat matching with the orientation of joint plane rose diagrams fig 3 the region around wp4 has exposed dolerite dyke along ne sw direction mandal et al 2012 which is expected to appear as lineament as well 2 3 hydraulically significant lineaments to determine the lineaments facilitating good groundwater flow fracture frequency and fracture aperture data was collected by conducting fieldwork table 2 during the field work fracture frequency was measured from the outcrop by considering the number of fractures appearing in 1 m perpendicular to the alignment of parallel co parallel fractures fracture apertures were measured directly from outcrop using a millimetre scale with respect to their strike directions collected data has been used to create scatter plot diagrams with respect to their strike directions it can be seen from fig 4 fracture frequencies and aperture values are plotted along their strike directions for all the waypoints fig 4 is created from field collected data given in table 2 in wp1 both fracture frequencies and aperture are high along 50 direction at wp2 fracture frequencies and apertures are high along 30 40 direction and along 140 160 fracture frequency is moderate but aperture is high at wp3 both fracture frequencies and aperture values are high along 20 direction at wp4 along 0 20 both fracture frequencies and apertures are high and along 100 120 fracture frequency is high and aperture value is moderate at wp5 along 100 120 both fracture frequencies and aperture values are high and along n s direction both fracture frequencies and aperture values are moderate so these fracture directions are hydraulically significant and produces lineaments which are essentially hydraulically significant lineaments all these fracture directions foliation directions and lineament directions are plotted as rose diagrams for each waypoint are shown in fig 3 for visual comparison it is clear that dominant lineament directions are a result of a combination of foliation direction and some joint plane directions only the joint planes or fracture planes with high fracture frequencies and aperture are capable of generating lineaments due to its water flowing ability so hydraulically significant lineaments are required to be extracted from lineament directions 2 4 foliation parallel lineaments and other lineaments foliation planes of all the waypoints wp1 to wp5 have been measured data is used to create rose diagrams fig 3 visual interpretation shows foliation planes are contributing to lineament rose diagrams foliation planes which are concentrated and pervasive in nature possibly ideal to generate lineaments in metamorphic rock terrain acharya et al 2012 study area has some major shear zones those are trending ene wsw to e w from south to north and are designated as south purulia shear zone spsz north purulia shear zone npsz these shear zones have contributed to foliation development which is being represented as rose diagrams fig 3 apart from the foliation planes there are other geological lineaments can be present as discussed earlier as described earlier reported dolerite dykes present in parts of purulia which will develop lineaments as it is a discrete linear feature gupta 1991 lineaments developing due to foliation planes and other non hydraulic linear features must be subtracted from total lineaments to get only the hydraulically significant lineaments 2 5 extraction of hydraulically significant lineaments using set theory since the total lineament set is a combination of regional foliations other lineaments and hydraulically significant lineaments a method is required to eliminate the hydraulically non significant lineaments so that only hydraulically important lineaments would remain set theory has been used to extract hydraulically significant lineament set directly from the lineament map of study area a graphical representation is given in fig 5 let us take four main sets set u set a set b and set c where u total lineaments which includes all the lineaments that exists on a lineament map of study area universal set a major lineaments which are represented in the rose diagrams b foliation planes that exists in the study area and represents themselves on rose diagrams c all other geological lineaments that are not hydraulically important u x x is a natural number x 0 and x 180 a y y is a natural number y 0 and y 180 b z z is a natural number z 0 and z 180 c s s is a natural number s 0 and s 180 here a u and also b a and c a therefore b u also c u now 1 a b c t t є a b c c c here t is a natural number and t 0 and t 180 t will include all natural numbers of y minus natural numbers z and s simply t y z s the universal set u have all the lineaments present on the map set a shows only the lineaments which are appearing as dominant sets in rose diagrams fig 3 set b a subset of set a includes foliation planes which also appear as dominating trend and set c represents any other dominant geological lineaments which are hydrologically non significant all the trends measured manually from the lineament map and their trend falls within 0 180 and all are natural numbers elements of set u defined by x elements in set a defined by y elements of set b is defined by z and elements of set c is defined by s all are natural numbers tables 4 and 5 since all the foliation planes in set b appears as major lineaments so set b is a set within set a that is set b belongs to set a similar is the fate for all lineaments of set c those belong to set a as well now it is a simple subtraction operation in set that is set a b c this operation is necessary as only hydraulically significant lineaments are required which are not foliation planes it is demonstrated by three common set theory operations compliment u and ո the bc or cc b compliment or c compliment means all the lineaments present in universe except for those in set b and set c the u union of a collection of sets is a set of all elements in the collection the ո intersection is a set operation between two sets to extract out only the common elements between those two sets so a ո bc u cc means only those lineaments will be taken which are not common to set b and set c but common to set a from the universe so t in eq 1 represents all major lineament directions minus all the foliation trends and all geological lineaments which are hydraulically irrelevant this operation leaves us with the lineaments which are appearing as major lineaments generated from fractures with high fracture frequencies and aperture values from the whole lineament map and those are hydraulically significant lineaments all the lineament data of set u set a set b and set c is tabled in table 4 the lineaments of set b foliation plane data and lineaments of set c non hydraulically significant lineaments should be subtracted from set a all major lineament directions here table 4 shows how all foliation lineaments are now subtracted from all the major lineaments during this subtraction a buffering of 10 is considered in order to minimise the error which may have occurred during the field data collection only two lineament trends 70 and 72 does not match with the lineaments of waypoints because those are representation of dykes reported from study area by other research workers all the dominating lineaments which are not hydraulically significant must be subtracted the remaining lineament directions achieved by using eq 1 represents only hydraulically significant lineaments developed from the fracture planes having both high fracture frequencies and aperture values final extracted lineament directions are shown in the final column hydraulically significant lineament directions of table 4 3 case study of extraction of hydraulically significant lineaments from each waypoint using proposed set theory the proposed process of extraction of lineaments using set theory has been used over all waypoints to provide a case study all the major lineaments observed in each of our waypoints fig 1 are used and equation 1 has been applied to extract hydraulically significant lineaments the details are given in the table below the table shows how the theory is used to trace out the hydraulically significant lineaments as previously mentioned under section 2 5 the 70 direction is dolerite dyke trend as established by early workers so it is removed now we have location wp3 having highest number of hydraulically significant lineaments 4 ground truthing of waypoint wp3 that is showing maximum hydraulically significant lineaments rock types identified here are highly deformed and metamorphosed rock type identified is metamorphosed granite fig 6 and quartzite fig 7 characterised by numerous close spaced intense fractures rock types present here shows extreme degree of grain refinement and stretching and cataclastic deformation which has made this zone highly fractured figs 6 and 7 drastically increasing fracture frequency of this region and making the zone extremely susceptible for further weathering and improving its hydraulic significance acharya et al 2012 acharya and basumallik 2012 in this particular region presence of syntaxial veins has been observed within metamorphosed granites fig 8 since the vein fibre material comprises quartz grains present in the host rock these are termed as syntaxial as in syntaxial veins fibres meet at a medial structure and the mineral grains extends from there to the opposite walls twiss and moores 1992 with quartz grains are tapered towards the vein margin and blocky at centre fig 8 that central medial plane is normally a thin fracture and overgrowth of minerals take place on both sides of that medial plane so newest mineral precipitates at medial line and oldest mineral rests near vein wall rock contact bons 2000 the location wp3 is near chas railway station is a highly deformed area with intense close spaced fractures and presence of syntaxial veins in metamorphosed granite and quartzite bedrocks it shows extreme cataclastic deformation and develops number of fractures in narrow spaced areas increasing fracture frequency and hydraulic significance 5 result and discussion the present study aims to detect the direction of particular set of lineaments which is essential as far as groundwater potentiality is concerned in a tropical semi arid plateau region composed of hard metamorphosed crystalline rocks which suffers from intense physical and chemical weathering the present work extracts only hydraulically significant lineaments with the help of set theory from lineament map with the help of set theory hydraulically significant lineament directions table 4 have been extracted which shows a concurrence with the fracture directions having high fracture frequencies and aperture values from study area which supports the fact that fractures having high frequency as well as high aperture values are hydraulically significant mabee and hardcastle 1997 acharya and basumallik 2012 braathen 1999 henriksen and braathen 2006 singhal and gupta 2010 bertels et al 2001 yeo et al 1998 it is also clear how some specific directions have high fracture frequencies and aperture values fractures along 50 direction in wp1 fractures along 30 40 and along 140 160 direction in wp2 fractures along 20 direction in wp3 fractures along 0 20 and along 100 120 direction in wp4 and fractures along 100 120 and along n s direction in wp5 have high to moderate fracture frequencies and aperture values indicating those are hydraulically significant fractures ground truthing analysis in all the waypoints represents that wp3 has maximum hydraulic potential in terms of number of significant lineaments that particular location shows very narrowly placed joint fracture planes in metamorphosed granites and quartzites giving rise to very high fracture frequency extreme grain size reduction by deformation growth of syntaxial veins metamorphosed granites and quartzites which are exposed in the zone of maximum hydraulically significant lineaments appear to contribute intense fractures in the bedrocks these rocks are considered brittle than slates and schists acharya and prasad 2017 which are the other prominent exposed bedrocks in older metamorphic terrain of the study area and other places too hence metamorphosed granites and quartzites can produce and preserve open joints whereas slates schists develop clay minerals by weathering that fills up the fracture cook 2003 such brittle rocks are more capable to endure wide aperture fractures than other soft rocks banks et al 2002 syntaxial vein signatures channelised flow of parent fluid through prominent fracture systems dabi et al 2011 hilgers and urai 2002 hilgers et al 2003 lee et al 1996 assigned as significant fluid conduits it has already been established from previous work that fractures having high frequencies and aperture values have significant groundwater flowing capacity in this study area acharya and basumallik 2012 acharya et al 2012 2014 bib acharya et al 2012 acharya and prasad 2017 bib acharya et al 2014 the ground truth proves the signature characteristics of the waypoint that is showing maximum hydraulically significant lineaments in the proposed extraction method of set theory it is clear that some of the lineament trends derived from satellite imagery is appearing as dominant in rose diagrams which shows a concurrence with fractures having high frequency and apertures it is believed that such significant fractures are facilitating lineament development because of their greater groundwater flowing capacity with proper usage of set theory exactly those lineaments are extracted effectively the case study and ground verification suggest the efficacy of the proposed hydraulically significant lineament extraction technique using the set theory so it can be concluded that hydraulically significant lineaments in a plateau region under semi arid tropical climate can be successfully filtered out applying set theory computation as derived in eq 1 in precambrian metamorphic terrain 6 conclusion lineament analysis for investigation of groundwater potential zones is a common practise the attempt to trace out only hydraulically significant lineaments with the help of set theory has been fruitful lineaments extracted with this theory shows coincidence with ground fractures with relatively higher fracture frequency and aperture values promoting good groundwater flow in a semi arid strongly weathered plateau region made of precambrian metamorphosed rocks intense deformation in brittle bedrocks like metamorphosed granites and quartzites resulting very closely spaced fractures signatures of channelised flow through fracture systems are the geologic factors on ground which contribute more presence of hydraulically significant lineaments in satellite imagery in such older metamorphic terrain so it can be concluded that application of mathematical set theory can successfully delineate only the hydraulically significant lineaments representing the hydraulically significant fractures thus associated with high groundwater potential in precambrian semi arid metamorphic terrain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

ideal to generate lineaments in metamorphic rock terrain acharya et al 2012 study area has some major shear zones those are trending ene wsw to e w from south to north and are designated as south purulia shear zone spsz north purulia shear zone npsz these shear zones have contributed to foliation development which is being represented as rose diagrams fig 3 apart from the foliation planes there are other geological lineaments can be present as discussed earlier as described earlier reported dolerite dykes present in parts of purulia which will develop lineaments as it is a discrete linear feature gupta 1991 lineaments developing due to foliation planes and other non hydraulic linear features must be subtracted from total lineaments to get only the hydraulically significant lineaments 2 5 extraction of hydraulically significant lineaments using set theory since the total lineament set is a combination of regional foliations other lineaments and hydraulically significant lineaments a method is required to eliminate the hydraulically non significant lineaments so that only hydraulically important lineaments would remain set theory has been used to extract hydraulically significant lineament set directly from the lineament map of study area a graphical representation is given in fig 5 let us take four main sets set u set a set b and set c where u total lineaments which includes all the lineaments that exists on a lineament map of study area universal set a major lineaments which are represented in the rose diagrams b foliation planes that exists in the study area and represents themselves on rose diagrams c all other geological lineaments that are not hydraulically important u x x is a natural number x 0 and x 180 a y y is a natural number y 0 and y 180 b z z is a natural number z 0 and z 180 c s s is a natural number s 0 and s 180 here a u and also b a and c a therefore b u also c u now 1 a b c t t є a b c c c here t is a natural number and t 0 and t 180 t will include all natural numbers of y minus natural numbers z and s simply t y z s the universal set u have all the lineaments present on the map set a shows only the lineaments which are appearing as dominant sets in rose diagrams fig 3 set b a subset of set a includes foliation planes which also appear as dominating trend and set c represents any other dominant geological lineaments which are hydrologically non significant all the trends measured manually from the lineament map and their trend falls within 0 180 and all are natural numbers elements of set u defined by x elements in set a defined by y elements of set b is defined by z and elements of set c is defined by s all are natural numbers tables 4 and 5 since all the foliation planes in set b appears as major lineaments so set b is a set within set a that is set b belongs to set a similar is the fate for all lineaments of set c those belong to set a as well now it is a simple subtraction operation in set that is set a b c this operation is necessary as only hydraulically significant lineaments are required which are not foliation planes it is demonstrated by three common set theory operations compliment u and ո the bc or cc b compliment or c compliment means all the lineaments present in universe except for those in set b and set c the u union of a collection of sets is a set of all elements in the collection the ո intersection is a set operation between two sets to extract out only the common elements between those two sets so a ո bc u cc means only those lineaments will be taken which are not common to set b and set c but common to set a from the universe so t in eq 1 represents all major lineament directions minus all the foliation trends and all geological lineaments which are hydraulically irrelevant this operation leaves us with the lineaments which are appearing as major lineaments generated from fractures with high fracture frequencies and aperture values from the whole lineament map and those are hydraulically significant lineaments all the lineament data of set u set a set b and set c is tabled in table 4 the lineaments of set b foliation plane data and lineaments of set c non hydraulically significant lineaments should be subtracted from set a all major lineament directions here table 4 shows how all foliation lineaments are now subtracted from all the major lineaments during this subtraction a buffering of 10 is considered in order to minimise the error which may have occurred during the field data collection only two lineament trends 70 and 72 does not match with the lineaments of waypoints because those are representation of dykes reported from study area by other research workers all the dominating lineaments which are not hydraulically significant must be subtracted the remaining lineament directions achieved by using eq 1 represents only hydraulically significant lineaments developed from the fracture planes having both high fracture frequencies and aperture values final extracted lineament directions are shown in the final column hydraulically significant lineament directions of table 4 3 case study of extraction of hydraulically significant lineaments from each waypoint using proposed set theory the proposed process of extraction of lineaments using set theory has been used over all waypoints to provide a case study all the major lineaments observed in each of our waypoints fig 1 are used and equation 1 has been applied to extract hydraulically significant lineaments the details are given in the table below the table shows how the theory is used to trace out the hydraulically significant lineaments as previously mentioned under section 2 5 the 70 direction is dolerite dyke trend as established by early workers so it is removed now we have location wp3 having highest number of hydraulically significant lineaments 4 ground truthing of waypoint wp3 that is showing maximum hydraulically significant lineaments rock types identified here are highly deformed and metamorphosed rock type identified is metamorphosed granite fig 6 and quartzite fig 7 characterised by numerous close spaced intense fractures rock types present here shows extreme degree of grain refinement and stretching and cataclastic deformation which has made this zone highly fractured figs 6 and 7 drastically increasing fracture frequency of this region and making the zone extremely susceptible for further weathering and improving its hydraulic significance acharya et al 2012 acharya and basumallik 2012 in this particular region presence of syntaxial veins has been observed within metamorphosed granites fig 8 since the vein fibre material comprises quartz grains present in the host rock these are termed as syntaxial as in syntaxial veins fibres meet at a medial structure and the mineral grains extends from there to the opposite walls twiss and moores 1992 with quartz grains are tapered towards the vein margin and blocky at centre fig 8 that central medial plane is normally a thin fracture and overgrowth of minerals take place on both sides of that medial plane so newest mineral precipitates at medial line and oldest mineral rests near vein wall rock contact bons 2000 the location wp3 is near chas railway station is a highly deformed area with intense close spaced fractures and presence of syntaxial veins in metamorphosed granite and quartzite bedrocks it shows extreme cataclastic deformation and develops number of fractures in narrow spaced areas increasing fracture frequency and hydraulic significance 5 result and discussion the present study aims to detect the direction of particular set of lineaments which is essential as far as groundwater potentiality is concerned in a tropical semi arid plateau region composed of hard metamorphosed crystalline rocks which suffers from intense physical and chemical weathering the present work extracts only hydraulically significant lineaments with the help of set theory from lineament map with the help of set theory hydraulically significant lineament directions table 4 have been extracted which shows a concurrence with the fracture directions having high fracture frequencies and aperture values from study area which supports the fact that fractures having high frequency as well as high aperture values are hydraulically significant mabee and hardcastle 1997 acharya and basumallik 2012 braathen 1999 henriksen and braathen 2006 singhal and gupta 2010 bertels et al 2001 yeo et al 1998 it is also clear how some specific directions have high fracture frequencies and aperture values fractures along 50 direction in wp1 fractures along 30 40 and along 140 160 direction in wp2 fractures along 20 direction in wp3 fractures along 0 20 and along 100 120 direction in wp4 and fractures along 100 120 and along n s direction in wp5 have high to moderate fracture frequencies and aperture values indicating those are hydraulically significant fractures ground truthing analysis in all the waypoints represents that wp3 has maximum hydraulic potential in terms of number of significant lineaments that particular location shows very narrowly placed joint fracture planes in metamorphosed granites and quartzites giving rise to very high fracture frequency extreme grain size reduction by deformation growth of syntaxial veins metamorphosed granites and quartzites which are exposed in the zone of maximum hydraulically significant lineaments appear to contribute intense fractures in the bedrocks these rocks are considered brittle than slates and schists acharya and prasad 2017 which are the other prominent exposed bedrocks in older metamorphic terrain of the study area and other places too hence metamorphosed granites and quartzites can produce and preserve open joints whereas slates schists develop clay minerals by weathering that fills up the fracture cook 2003 such brittle rocks are more capable to endure wide aperture fractures than other soft rocks banks et al 2002 syntaxial vein signatures channelised flow of parent fluid through prominent fracture systems dabi et al 2011 hilgers and urai 2002 hilgers et al 2003 lee et al 1996 assigned as significant fluid conduits it has already been established from previous work that fractures having high frequencies and aperture values have significant groundwater flowing capacity in this study area acharya and basumallik 2012 acharya et al 2012 2014 bib acharya et al 2012 acharya and prasad 2017 bib acharya et al 2014 the ground truth proves the signature characteristics of the waypoint that is showing maximum hydraulically significant lineaments in the proposed extraction method of set theory it is clear that some of the lineament trends derived from satellite imagery is appearing as dominant in rose diagrams which shows a concurrence with fractures having high frequency and apertures it is believed that such significant fractures are facilitating lineament development because of their greater groundwater flowing capacity with proper usage of set theory exactly those lineaments are extracted effectively the case study and ground verification suggest the efficacy of the proposed hydraulically significant lineament extraction technique using the set theory so it can be concluded that hydraulically significant lineaments in a plateau region under semi arid tropical climate can be successfully filtered out applying set theory computation as derived in eq 1 in precambrian metamorphic terrain 6 conclusion lineament analysis for investigation of groundwater potential zones is a common practise the attempt to trace out only hydraulically significant lineaments with the help of set theory has been fruitful lineaments extracted with this theory shows coincidence with ground fractures with relatively higher fracture frequency and aperture values promoting good groundwater flow in a semi arid strongly weathered plateau region made of precambrian metamorphosed rocks intense deformation in brittle bedrocks like metamorphosed granites and quartzites resulting very closely spaced fractures signatures of channelised flow through fracture systems are the geologic factors on ground which contribute more presence of hydraulically significant lineaments in satellite imagery in such older metamorphic terrain so it can be concluded that application of mathematical set theory can successfully delineate only the hydraulically significant lineaments representing the hydraulically significant fractures thus associated with high groundwater potential in precambrian semi arid metamorphic terrain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12111,in india geothermal energy is still in nascent stage and there are several geothermal regions which are not explored by exploring these fields india will be able to understand the potential of geothermal energy and its application for power generation and development in other industrial and agricultural sectors as world is switching from conventional to renewable energy sector geothermal energy will be one of the most promising alternative for fossil fuels the cambay region of west coast continental margin has enormous geothermal potentials in this paper one such geothermal zone of cambay basin namely dholera has been explored to understand the potential of the region an extensive mt survey has been carried out in this region along 6 profile lines and 66 station points the main aim of the paper is to identify the shallow and deep aquifer zones in the study area for exploitation of geothermal energy which can be used for various societal benefits in order to explore aquifer potentials mt data was acquired using system2000 net phoenix geophysics ltd equipment this is the first high resolution 3d seismic survey was carried out in the study area in order to identify the geothermal sweet spots skew tipper and polar diagrams were prepared to understand the dimension of the identified conductive bodies the interpretation of mt data in the form of geoelectrical maps indicate presence of high conductive zones at 5 km depth extending up to 7 km this high conductive bodies indicates the presence of aquifers which can be the zone of interest drilling will target these zones to exploite geothermal water graphical abstract image 1 keywords geothermal dholera magnetotelluric resistivity anomaly 1 introduction magnetotelluric survey is a passive geophysical

magnetic coils 4 methodology and range of geophysical works the magnetotelluric mt method is a passive electromagnetic em technique that measures the electrical and magnetic fields on the surface of the earth in orthogonal directions in the sense that it uses naturally occurring geomagnetic variations as the energy source the mt technique is passive field sources are equal ionosphere present schemes magnetotelluric mt frequency range below 1 hz and equatorial wind discharges in the earth ionosphere cavity audio frequency magnetotelluric frequency range from 1 hz to 10 khz the source periodicity as well as the sub surface resistivity distribution have an impact on the information retrieval depth the inquiry depth ranges from several tens of meters to hundreds of kilometres rodi and mackie 2001 from the proportions of electrical e and magnetic h field elements in the frequency domain complicated impedance z ω can be defined at radial frequency 1 z ω e ω h ω the ratios of powers of the field can be scaled as an apparent resistivity ρ ω similar to dc resistivity exploration 2 ρ a ω 1 ω e ω h ω 2 and the phase of electric and magnetic field ϕ ω is given by 3 ϕ ω t a n 1 e ω h ω 2 the obvious resistivity and phase differ with frequency for the multi layered one dimensional 1d earth and their frequency variation can be reversed to expose geoelectrical environment composition when earth is more complicated than 1d and there are horizontal as well as vertical variations in electrical conductivity two or three dimensional models should be regarded impedance should be regarded as a tensor in such instances 4 z z x x z x y z y x z y y 5 mt data processing software like ssmt2000 and mt editor were used to process raw mt amt data raw time series calibration files and site parameters were used as input data for mt data processing in ssmt2000 software jones et al 1989 after that it is converted into fourier coefficients which can be related to reference sites data using robust routines mt outputs are obtained as cross powers for single frequencies these plots were used as input to mt editor software to generate resistivity and phase curves along with individual cross powers winglink 2005 mt editor is used to remove single cross powers from the calculation to improve the data quality by changing the mask not by deleting the data in order to restore the individual cross powers in the future graphical representation of the data is attained by merging the individual cross powers using mt editor in mt survey the regional structures can be identified by galvanic distortions caused due to near surface inhomogeneities mcneice and jones 2001 bahr 1991 multi site and multi frequency distortion decomposition method by mcneice and jones 2001 based on the principle of groom bailey gb groom and bailey 1989 technique has been used to understand the dimensionality and strike of the formation 6 mt data interpretation there are two main steps during interpretation of mt data qualitative interpretation which means mainly dimensionality and data quality analysis of mt data and quantitative interpretation which means inversion of magnetotelluric curves from frequency period to depth domain interpretation of mt amt data was based on 1d occam algorithm adapted to winglink interpretation system occam algorithm method is generally used for 1d inversion of the mt data the output is in the form of layered model which can be presented after being interpolated in cross section form with the use of occam algorithm we get final model without any influence of interpreter the model is smooth i e there is no sharp boundaries between geoelectrical layers application of occam algorithm gives essential properties of the model data in terms of depth resistivity and layers constable et al 1987 the obtained data is matched to the geoelectrical models some of which can be highly complex than the others the model could be as complex as the medium however not more the algorithm depart from half space and generates a satisfied medium the variation of resistivity in layers takes place until the observed and calculated curves are achieved to local minima value caldwell et al 2004 6 1 qualitative interpretation the dimensionality parameters like tipper magnitude skew azimuth and phase curve leads to qualitative interpretation of mt data generally the polar diagrams phase tensor and strike analysis helps to understand the dimensionality and orientation of the regional body apparent resistivity of two mt sounding d1 2 and d1 4 are shown in figs 3 and 4 with phase curve tipper magnitude skew and azimuth apparent resistivity is defined as the ratio of electric field strength to the magnetic field strength at a given frequency jackie et al 2007 the impedance phase is proportional to the slope of the apparent resistivity curve on a log log plot but from baselines at 45 vozoff 1991 skew value response less than or about 0 3 of geological formation beneath the surface are typically for 1d body higher skew value more than 0 2 shows presence of 2d or 3d value he et al 2016 the dimensionality of the survey is highly dependent on the frequency range between 10 000 hz 1 hz characteristics of the survey area are prominently depicted by the 1d or 2d geoelectric model whereas for frequency greater than 0 01 hz the skew parameter is greater based on the geoelectric point of view it is possible to have 3d environment at deeper depth tikhonov 1965 geoelectrical models of 1d can be characterised by analysing skew and tipper distribution of impedance tensor skew parameter is bigger than 0 3 for frequencies greater than 0 001 hz therefore from the geoelectrical point of view at deeper depths it is possible to have 3d environment polar diagram analysis offers more comprehensive data on dimensionality and makes it possible to determine whether a 1d or 2d model exists by analyzing polar diagrams it can be said that for frequencies ranging from 10 khz to about 0 107 hz 1d model can be regarded for zxy impedance that is nearly circular and zxx almost invisible fig 5 generally 2d model should be considered for frequency ranges between 0 011 and 0 0011 hz fig 6 in the nnw sse direction polar diagrams zxy are elongated azimuth about 337 and zxx is compact polar diagram shape indicates that two possible homogeneity axes 67 or 33 exist the homogeneity of the azimuth axis is approximately 67 or 337 analysis of the geological information available indicates that the homogeneity azimuth axis is 337 it is parallel to deccan tarp and the west cambay fault the western portion of the cambay graben s geological structure second level non symmetric 2 d tensor can be graphically described by an ellipse bibby 1986 the ellipse s major and minor axes in particular represent the tensor s main axes and values with the main axis orientation defined by the α β angle fig 7 it has been seen that α is the direction of the main axis where the phase tensor is symmetric i e β 0 the skew angle β is non zero in the general 3 d case and represents the rotation of the phase tensor ellipse s main axis away from an identically shaped ellipse defined by a symmetric tensor fig 8 if the phase tensor is non symmetric the tensor must be defined by a third coordinate invariant represented by the angle β the position of the ellipse s main axis defined by the angle α β determines the tensor s relationship to the reference frame or coordinate system of the observer x1 x2 for the above results the skew angle β plot of observation points for all frequency ranges is shown in fig 9 the results show that for frequencies greater than 0 1 hz most of the β values are distributed within 5 at lower frequencies 0 001 hz 0 1 hz the β values are distributed in the range of 10 10 β this finding suggests that for the higher frequency the resistivity structure can be considered to be 1 d or 2 d the regional geology of the area is dominated by formations extending in the nw se direction based on each site s geoelectric strike analysis most sites have a similar dominant direction with the regional structure especially when considering 90 uncertainty figs 10 and 11 shows the direction from each site s geoelectric strike analysis the study of geoelectric strike was also conducted for all stations for all periods as well as for some times the goal of the latter is to examine if there are directional changes with depth in the field the results from all frequency ranges 0 001 hz 0 01 hz show a relatively clear path of geoelectric strike particularly from polar diagram study these reflect n 150oe or n 30ow strike path that is in good agreement with the area s regional ne se structure these reflect a strike path of n150oe or n 30ow in good agreement with the regional ne se structure of the area with data analysis at longer frequencies 0 001 hz 0 01 hz more positive results are obtained there is no different strike path from both swift and polar diagram approaches for short frequency up to 0 001 hz this tendency is usually observed at a relatively shallow depth i e no structural direction in many areas showing dominant 2d or layered setting the effects of the main axes of the phase tensor are in good agreement with the national general strike this reveals that the dominating strikes for all frequency ranges are nw se and ne sw directions 6 2 quantitative interpretation data interpretation was based on the occam algorithm taken in the winglink interpretation scheme for 1d inversion using the occam algorithm leads to a straightforward model that contains the vital characteristics of all possible field information fitting models occam s inversion algorithm results were interpolated and shown as a section of resistivity reflecting the diversity of the geological centre along the line of profiles resistivity distribution was shown for two types of models up to 10 km bsldeep fig 12 a f and up to 1000 m bslshallow fig 13 a e calculated models can be defined as two layer models for yx mode fig 12 a f the first geoelectric layer is about 1 6 ωm of resistivity in the western parts of the research area the thickness of this layer is about 200 m and rises to about 1000 m in the se parts of the area there is an elevated resistivity basement below this layer the body has some anomalies they are situated close to the locations of d2 12 d6 12 d2 12 d6 14 mt these anomalies have a decreased resistivity of up to 400 ωm there are models calculated to a depth of 1000 m bsl fig 13 a e as it has been previously mentioned geologic medium up to 1000 m depth is 1d models shown in fig 13 a e are of very low resistivity the thickness of the shallowest layer characterized by very low resistivity less than 1 7 ohmm is 100 m in the area of d1 2 mt sites and increases up to even 700 m in the area of d3 22 mt site this layer can be blended with salt water by combining quaternary and tertiary sediments sediment thicknes generally reduces in the se direction where volcanic extremely resistive deccan rocks appear on the surface this is clearly visible in the cross sections but it is difficult to accurately determine the top deccan basalts without borehole if we knew the depth to the top deccan basalts from borehole it would be easy to determine the morphology of the top on the basis of isolines resistivity from 1d inversion models in figures no 13 a 13 e show the distribution of resistivity to a depth of 1000 m from the geo electrical point of view these models are very simple we can only say that as it was previously mentioned low resistivity layer reduces its thickness towards the wsw deccan traps because the near surface layer has a low resistivity it is very difficult to find anomalies that can be directly associated with the hot water pbg report 2d 2014 6 3 geoelectric maps this section shows distribution of resistivity at 5 km and 7 km depths maps have been created based on mt data the following section concludes the analysis of these maps resistivity distributions are shown on depth 5 km and 7 km below sea level figs 14 and 15 there are low resistivity zones potential hot spots most prospective area extends from the mt site d1 16 d1 18 by mt sites d4 12 d2 12 to mt sites d3 8 d3 10 the best point to perform drilling is a region where low resistivity anomalies are at 7 km depth and go up the higher the better near mt sites d4 12 d6 12 and d3 10 7 conclusion indian geothermal fields are categorised into 5 classes namely nw se himalaya so na ta som narmada tapti lineament parts of gondwana grabens regions of delhi folding and west coast continental margin the cambay region of west coast continental margin has enormous geothermal potentials an extensive magnetotelluric survey was carried out along 6 profile lines consistings of 66 mt station point in dholera region of west coast continental margin area of 132 sq km was covered with spacing of 2 km between two station points ssmt2000 and mt editor program were used to process raw mt data 1d occam inversion was performed on data obtained from 6 profile lines for subsurface mapping the mt cross sections of dholera were divided into two layers namely upper layer is of low resistivity and high conductivity while the lower layer is of high resistivity and low conductivity the high conductive zone is trending towards ne and se direction of the cross section this layer can be linked to the ocean sediments infiltrated by salt water while the basement of the dholera region is found to be of high resistivity and it can be linked to volcanic rocks such as basalt deccan trap the 1d models show that there are low resistivity anomalies present up to a depth of 600 m this suggests that it may be associated with geothermal hot spots this also suggest that there can be a presence of water in form of aquifer in the high conductive zone of upper layer and the high resistivity basement is acting as a heat source for this water the geoelectrical mapping of this area indicates that there lies enormous potential for presence of hot aquifer at depth of 5 km which extends to around 7 km most prospective area extends from mt site d1 16 d1 18 to mt sites d4 12 d2 12 to mt sites d3 8 d3 10 it can also been seen at various instances that the results of the 1d and 2d mt studies complement each other and together provide a better visualisation of the subsurface anomalies the anomalies interpreted through mt data can be exploited by drilling shallow and deep test wells with target depths of about 1 km and 5 km authors contribution all the authors made substantial contribution in this manuscript ky ms and as participated in drafting the manuscript ky and

12111,in india geothermal energy is still in nascent stage and there are several geothermal regions which are not explored by exploring these fields india will be able to understand the potential of geothermal energy and its application for power generation and development in other industrial and agricultural sectors as world is switching from conventional to renewable energy sector geothermal energy will be one of the most promising alternative for fossil fuels the cambay region of west coast continental margin has enormous geothermal potentials in this paper one such geothermal zone of cambay basin namely dholera has been explored to understand the potential of the region an extensive mt survey has been carried out in this region along 6 profile lines and 66 station points the main aim of the paper is to identify the shallow and deep aquifer zones in the study area for exploitation of geothermal energy which can be used for various societal benefits in order to explore aquifer potentials mt data was acquired using system2000 net phoenix geophysics ltd equipment this is the first high resolution 3d seismic survey was carried out in the study area in order to identify the geothermal sweet spots skew tipper and polar diagrams were prepared to understand the dimension of the identified conductive bodies the interpretation of mt data in the form of geoelectrical maps indicate presence of high conductive zones at 5 km depth extending up to 7 km this high conductive bodies indicates the presence of aquifers which can be the zone of interest drilling will target these zones to exploite geothermal water graphical abstract image 1 keywords geothermal dholera magnetotelluric resistivity anomaly 1 introduction magnetotelluric survey is a passive geophysical

researcher along with co researchers participated in data acquisition around 132 km area was covered with spacing of 2 km between two station points for 13 15 km deep mt amt analysis the data has to be recorded in the frequency ranging between 10 khz and 0 001 khz and 0 0001 khz in order to reduce artificial noises in data the measurement of mt wave field was setup for 18 h the survey was performed along 6 profile lines and 66 mt stations fig 2 the 5 mt profile lines were oriented in wsw ene direction and 1 perpendicular to them the data were acquired along ex ey electrical poles of the length 100 m and hx hy and hz vertical components of magnetic poles v8 and mtu receivers and sensors were calibrated in situ before surveys in the calibration process the response of the instruments and components is measured using a known input signal location of each mt amt stations was determined with the use of gps technique the variations of electromagnetic field were recorded in

magnetic coils 4 methodology and range of geophysical works the magnetotelluric mt method is a passive electromagnetic em technique that measures the electrical and magnetic fields on the surface of the earth in orthogonal directions in the sense that it uses naturally occurring geomagnetic variations as the energy source the mt technique is passive field sources are equal ionosphere present schemes magnetotelluric mt frequency range below 1 hz and equatorial wind discharges in the earth ionosphere cavity audio frequency magnetotelluric frequency range from 1 hz to 10 khz the source periodicity as well as the sub surface resistivity distribution have an impact on the information retrieval depth the inquiry depth ranges from several tens of meters to hundreds of kilometres rodi and mackie 2001 from the proportions of electrical e and magnetic h field elements in the frequency domain complicated impedance z ω can be defined at radial frequency 1 z ω e ω h ω the ratios of powers of the field can be scaled as an apparent resistivity ρ ω similar to dc resistivity exploration 2 ρ a ω 1 ω e ω h ω 2 and the phase of electric and magnetic field ϕ ω is given by 3 ϕ ω t a n 1 e ω h ω 2 the obvious resistivity and phase differ with frequency for the multi layered one dimensional 1d earth and their frequency variation can be reversed to expose geoelectrical environment composition when earth is more complicated than 1d and there are horizontal as well as vertical variations in electrical conductivity two or three dimensional models should be regarded impedance should be regarded as a tensor in such instances 4 z z x x z x y z y x z y y 5 mt data processing software like ssmt2000 and mt editor were used to process raw mt amt data raw time series calibration files and site parameters were used as input data for mt data processing in ssmt2000 software jones et al 1989 after that it is converted into fourier coefficients which can be related to reference sites data using robust routines mt outputs are obtained as cross powers for single frequencies these plots were used as input to mt editor software to generate resistivity and phase curves along with individual cross powers winglink 2005 mt editor is used to remove single cross powers from the calculation to improve the data quality by changing the mask not by deleting the data in order to restore the individual cross powers in the future graphical representation of the data is attained by merging the individual cross powers using mt editor in mt survey the regional structures can be identified by galvanic distortions caused due to near surface inhomogeneities mcneice and jones 2001 bahr 1991 multi site and multi frequency distortion decomposition method by mcneice and jones 2001 based on the principle of groom bailey gb groom and bailey 1989 technique has been used to understand the dimensionality and strike of the formation 6 mt data interpretation there are two main steps during interpretation of mt data qualitative interpretation which means mainly dimensionality and data quality analysis of mt data and quantitative interpretation which means inversion of magnetotelluric curves from frequency period to depth domain interpretation of mt amt data was based on 1d occam algorithm adapted to winglink interpretation system occam algorithm method is generally used for 1d inversion of the mt data the output is in the form of layered model which can be presented after being interpolated in cross section form with the use of occam algorithm we get final model without any influence of interpreter the model is smooth i e there is no sharp boundaries between geoelectrical layers application of occam algorithm gives essential properties of the model data in terms of depth resistivity and layers constable et al 1987 the obtained data is matched to the geoelectrical models some of which can be highly complex than the others the model could be as complex as the medium however not more the algorithm depart from half space and generates a satisfied medium the variation of resistivity in layers takes place until the observed and calculated curves are achieved to local minima value caldwell et al 2004 6 1 qualitative interpretation the dimensionality parameters like tipper magnitude skew azimuth and phase curve leads to qualitative interpretation of mt data generally the polar diagrams phase tensor and strike analysis helps to understand the dimensionality and orientation of the regional body apparent resistivity of two mt sounding d1 2 and d1 4 are shown in figs 3 and 4 with phase curve tipper magnitude skew and azimuth apparent resistivity is defined as the ratio of electric field strength to the magnetic field strength at a given frequency jackie et al 2007 the impedance phase is proportional to the slope of the apparent resistivity curve on a log log plot but from baselines at 45 vozoff 1991 skew value response less than or about 0 3 of geological formation beneath the surface are typically for 1d body higher skew value more than 0 2 shows presence of 2d or 3d value he et al 2016 the dimensionality of the survey is highly dependent on the frequency range between 10 000 hz 1 hz characteristics of the survey area are prominently depicted by the 1d or 2d geoelectric model whereas for frequency greater than 0 01 hz the skew parameter is greater based on the geoelectric point of view it is possible to have 3d environment at deeper depth tikhonov 1965 geoelectrical models of 1d can be characterised by analysing skew and tipper distribution of impedance tensor skew parameter is bigger than 0 3 for frequencies greater than 0 001 hz therefore from the geoelectrical point of view at deeper depths it is possible to have 3d environment polar diagram analysis offers more comprehensive data on dimensionality and makes it possible to determine whether a 1d or 2d model exists by analyzing polar diagrams it can be said that for frequencies ranging from 10 khz to about 0 107 hz 1d model can be regarded for zxy impedance that is nearly circular and zxx almost invisible fig 5 generally 2d model should be considered for frequency ranges between 0 011 and 0 0011 hz fig 6 in the nnw sse direction polar diagrams zxy are elongated azimuth about 337 and zxx is compact polar diagram shape indicates that two possible homogeneity axes 67 or 33 exist the homogeneity of the azimuth axis is approximately 67 or 337 analysis of the geological information available indicates that the homogeneity azimuth axis is 337 it is parallel to deccan tarp and the west cambay fault the western portion of the cambay graben s geological structure second level non symmetric 2 d tensor can be graphically described by an ellipse bibby 1986 the ellipse s major and minor axes in particular represent the tensor s main axes and values with the main axis orientation defined by the α β angle fig 7 it has been seen that α is the direction of the main axis where the phase tensor is symmetric i e β 0 the skew angle β is non zero in the general 3 d case and represents the rotation of the phase tensor ellipse s main axis away from an identically shaped ellipse defined by a symmetric tensor fig 8 if the phase tensor is non symmetric the tensor must be defined by a third coordinate invariant represented by the angle β the position of the ellipse s main axis defined by the angle α β determines the tensor s relationship to the reference frame or coordinate system of the observer x1 x2 for the above results the skew angle β plot of observation points for all frequency ranges is shown in fig 9 the results show that for frequencies greater than 0 1 hz most of the β values are distributed within 5 at lower frequencies 0 001 hz 0 1 hz the β values are distributed in the range of 10 10 β this finding suggests that for the higher frequency the resistivity structure can be considered to be 1 d or 2 d the regional geology of the area is dominated by formations extending in the nw se direction based on each site s geoelectric strike analysis most sites have a similar dominant direction with the regional structure especially when considering 90 uncertainty figs 10 and 11 shows the direction from each site s geoelectric strike analysis the study of geoelectric strike was also conducted for all stations for all periods as well as for some times the goal of the latter is to examine if there are directional changes with depth in the field the results from all frequency ranges 0 001 hz 0 01 hz show a relatively clear path of geoelectric strike particularly from polar diagram study these reflect n 150oe or n 30ow strike path that is in good agreement with the area s regional ne se structure these reflect a strike path of n150oe or n 30ow in good agreement with the regional ne se structure of the area with data analysis at longer frequencies 0 001 hz 0 01 hz more positive results are obtained there is no different strike path from both swift and polar diagram approaches for short frequency up to 0 001 hz this tendency is usually observed at a relatively shallow depth i e no structural direction in many areas showing dominant 2d or layered setting the effects of the main axes of the phase tensor are in good agreement with the national general strike this reveals that the dominating strikes for all frequency ranges are nw se and ne sw directions 6 2 quantitative interpretation data interpretation was based on the occam algorithm taken in the winglink interpretation scheme for 1d inversion using the occam algorithm leads to a straightforward model that contains the vital characteristics of all possible field information fitting models occam s inversion algorithm results were interpolated and shown as a section of resistivity reflecting the diversity of the geological centre along the line of profiles resistivity distribution was shown for two types of models up to 10 km bsldeep fig 12 a f and up to 1000 m bslshallow fig 13 a e calculated models can be defined as two layer models for yx mode fig 12 a f the first geoelectric layer is about 1 6 ωm of resistivity in the western parts of the research area the thickness of this layer is about 200 m and rises to about 1000 m in the se parts of the area there is an elevated resistivity basement below this layer the body has some anomalies they are situated close to the locations of d2 12 d6 12 d2 12 d6 14 mt these anomalies have a decreased resistivity of up to 400 ωm there are models calculated to a depth of 1000 m bsl fig 13 a e as it has been previously mentioned geologic medium up to 1000 m depth is 1d models shown in fig 13 a e are of very low resistivity the thickness of the shallowest layer characterized by very low resistivity less than 1 7 ohmm is 100 m in the area of d1 2 mt sites and increases up to even 700 m in the area of d3 22 mt site this layer can be blended with salt water by combining quaternary and tertiary sediments sediment thicknes generally reduces in the se direction where volcanic extremely resistive deccan rocks appear on the surface this is clearly visible in the cross sections but it is difficult to accurately determine the top deccan basalts without borehole if we knew the depth to the top deccan basalts from borehole it would be easy to determine the morphology of the top on the basis of isolines resistivity from 1d inversion models in figures no 13 a 13 e show the distribution of resistivity to a depth of 1000 m from the geo electrical point of view these models are very simple we can only say that as it was previously mentioned low resistivity layer reduces its thickness towards the wsw deccan traps because the near surface layer has a low resistivity it is very difficult to find anomalies that can be directly associated with the hot water pbg report 2d 2014 6 3 geoelectric maps this section shows distribution of resistivity at 5 km and 7 km depths maps have been created based on mt data the following section concludes the analysis of these maps resistivity distributions are shown on depth 5 km and 7 km below sea level figs 14 and 15 there are low resistivity zones potential hot spots most prospective area extends from the mt site d1 16 d1 18 by mt sites d4 12 d2 12 to mt sites d3 8 d3 10 the best point to perform drilling is a region where low resistivity anomalies are at 7 km depth and go up the higher the better near mt sites d4 12 d6 12 and d3 10 7 conclusion indian geothermal fields are categorised into 5 classes namely nw se himalaya so na ta som narmada tapti lineament parts of gondwana grabens regions of delhi folding and west coast continental margin the cambay region of west coast continental margin has enormous geothermal potentials an extensive magnetotelluric survey was carried out along 6 profile lines consistings of 66 mt station point in dholera region of west coast continental margin area of 132 sq km was covered with spacing of 2 km between two station points ssmt2000 and mt editor program were used to process raw mt data 1d occam inversion was performed on data obtained from 6 profile lines for subsurface mapping the mt cross sections of dholera were divided into two layers namely upper layer is of low resistivity and high conductivity while the lower layer is of high resistivity and low conductivity the high conductive zone is trending towards ne and se direction of the cross section this layer can be linked to the ocean sediments infiltrated by salt water while the basement of the dholera region is found to be of high resistivity and it can be linked to volcanic rocks such as basalt deccan trap the 1d models show that there are low resistivity anomalies present up to a depth of 600 m this suggests that it may be associated with geothermal hot spots this also suggest that there can be a presence of water in form of aquifer in the high conductive zone of upper layer and the high resistivity basement is acting as a heat source for this water the geoelectrical mapping of this area indicates that there lies enormous potential for presence of hot aquifer at depth of 5 km which extends to around 7 km most prospective area extends from mt site d1 16 d1 18 to mt sites d4 12 d2 12 to mt sites d3 8 d3 10 it can also been seen at various instances that the results of the 1d and 2d mt studies complement each other and together provide a better visualisation of the subsurface anomalies the anomalies interpreted through mt data can be exploited by drilling shallow and deep test wells with target depths of about 1 km and 5 km authors contribution all the authors made substantial contribution in this manuscript ky ms and as participated in drafting the manuscript ky and

12112,contamination of water with persistent pharmaceutical compounds has become an increasing concern of the current world and many studies have been working on the mitigation of such pollution groundwater a crucial water source has been contaminated with pharmaceuticals in the current study an electrocoagulation method has been used for the simultaneous removal of two common pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the first time the process was optimized via the one at a time method it was found that by increasing the contact time the removal efficiency of ibuprofen and acetaminophen reached 50 96 and 22 76 at electrolysis time of 110 min and pharmaceutical concentration of 40 ppm respectively the maximum efficiency was observed at 2 a electrode distance of 3 cm was superior to 5 and 6 cm optimum values of ph and agitation speed were seen at 5 and 200 rpm respectively to improve efficiency the double electrocoagulation stage was considered and the maximum adsorption efficiency of 78 and 48 respectively produced h2 gas is one of the other advantages of the electrocoagulation process therefore electrocoagulation can be suggested as a promising technique to eliminate pharmaceuticals from underground water graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocoagulation ibuprofen acetaminophen pharmaceutical 1 introduction the introduction of pharmaceutical waste into the environment has threatened humans so long inappropriate disposal manufacturing waste and uncontrolled consumption of drugs have resulted in pharmaceutical pollution in every aspect of the ecosystem ahmed 2017 khadir et al 2020a vatovec et al 2017 the presence and accumulation of biologically active drugs can cause serious harmful effects for the whole ecosystem increasing consumption of ibuprofen and acetaminophen by human beings results in the presence of these drugs in the surface and groundwater this presence has received increasing concern in recent years as these drugs are biologically active compounds with adverse effects for the environment khadir et al 2020b pires et al 2019 rabizadeh et al 2020 the importance of groundwater as vital source water for the ecosystem has been discussed well in the literature kubier et al 2019 machiwal et al 2018 anthropogenic activities have threatened the quality of the media as well as its quantity this could lead to the unavoidable fact that groundwater might not be appropriate for the direct use of humans atangana et al 2018 detection of pharmaceuticals in the groundwater has become a serious issue requiring further considerations in lagos state nigeria for instance ebele et al 2020 reported that a wide range of pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac glyburide naproxen nicotine codeine amoxicillin tramadol and gemfibrozil were detected in the groundwater ebele et al 2020 in the rural agricultural regions pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were detected lee et al 2019 in irrigated groundwater wells also pharmaceuticals were observed that the authors accused the wastewater contribution for groundwater pollution kibuye et al 2019 several other scholars szymczycha et al 2020 szymczycha et al 2020 gao et al 2020 gao et al 2020 l del rosario et al 2014 del rosario et al 2014 and n gottschall et al 2011 gottschall et al 2012 concluded that the presence of pharmaceutical compounds was evident indicative of potential groundwater contamination the trace amount of ibuprofen and acetaminophen has been detected in the waterways of many areas magadini et al 2020 yang et al 2016 the continuous exposure of the groundwater to pharmaceuticals specially ibuprofen and acetaminophen is assumed to arise critical health hazards in the upcoming future implementation of a proper and sustainable treatment method could be a promising solution for the current pharmaceutical pollution in the groundwater table 1 summarizes the advantages of common methods for pharmaceutical elimination lower quantity of sludge production low maintenance less power requirement lower cost and higher removal efficiency compared to conventional chemical coagulation are some of the main advantages of the electrocoagulation unit mohammadi et al 2019 three consecutive steps are involved in the electrocoagulation processes 1 electrochemical reactions 2 flotation 3 adsorption mohammadi et al 2019 this process creates metal ion complexes to destabilize colloids drugs in the aqueous solution in the case of groundwater electrocoagulation has been applied for the removal of almost common groundwater contaminants such as arsenic kobya et al 2020 and arsenite goren et al 2020 nitrate amarine et al 2020 perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids bao et al 2020 phosphates castañeda et al 2020 fluoride sandoval et al 2019 and chromium ali maitlo et al 2019 however few studies have been reported for the removal of pharmaceutical from groundwater by electrocoagulation in the current study for the first time simultaneous removal of acetaminophen act and ibuprofen ibu from groundwater by electrocoagulation technique was investigated the process was optimized by considering the effect of operational parameters including electrolysis time ph electrode materials agitation speed inter electrode distance and the current on the removal efficiency of the drugs moreover kinetics models were fitted with experimental data to identify the adsorption mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and equipment the standard drug of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were provided by temad pharmaceutical company located in iran fig 1 the electrodes aluminum and iron were supplied by a local market in tehran iran methanol and sodium chloride were purchased from merck company germany to adjust the ph of the solution naoh and hcl were employed purchased from merck company germany all the chemicals used during the study were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification solutions were prepared using deionized water uv spectrophotometer model dr6000 hach lang usa was utilized for the determination of pharmaceutical concentration the ph of the aqueous solution was set by 780 ph master metrohm switzerland 2 2 operating conditions experiments were conducted in an electrocoagulation reactor with iron and aluminum as electrodes cathode and anode a system in which simultaneous removal of acetaminophen and ibuprofen occurred was consisted of a 1 l breaker and two electrodes connected to a power supply with adjustable voltage and current the electrodes distance was 3 cm initially and for the simplicity of the process the ph was considered to be constant at the first step of the reaction some operating parameters in coagulation process for simultaneous removal of acetaminophen and ibuprofen were investigated including current inter electrode distance electrode material agitation speed and ph the dimensions of electrodes were 10 4 1 0 1 cm with the effective surface area of about 33 cm2 to remove the layers deposit on the electrodes they were washed with hcl solution then rubbed with sandpapers required samples were provided by a university in tehran iran to conduct the experiments the desired amount of drugs was added manually to the sample final concentrations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen were determined after each experiment for acetaminophen the maximum peak was observed at λ max 249 nm in which ibuprofen had the negligible absorbance the maximum peak for ibuprofen was recorded at λ max 222 nm to determine the concentration of each pharmaceutical in the mixture solution the beer lambert s law was used the electrocoagulation removal efficiency was calculated by equation 1 1 removal efficiency c f c i c i 100 where c f and c i are the final and initial concentration of the pharmaceutical respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrolysis time electrolysis duration is an underlying factor leading to a significant difference in the removal efficiency the initial concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen both were fixed at 40 ppm fig 2 illustrates the removal efficiency of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in different reaction time ranging from 0 to 180 min between electrolysis duration of 0 110 min the removal efficiency of acetaminophen increased and reached approximately 30 after 110 min further duration time did not affect the removal efficiency of acetaminophen the trend for the removal efficiency of ibuprofen shows a sharp increase until the reaction time of 15 min more increase in the removal efficiency of ibuprofen was observed up to 110 min the figure shows that both acetaminophen and ibuprofen have the same trend from 110 min to 180 min the improvement of efficiency by increasing the electrolysis time may be attributed to higher coagulant generation by time increment the produced amount of metal ions can be calculated by equation 2 2 m i t m f z where m is the molar mass of electrode g mol z and i are valency of the anode and the current a respectively f is the faraday s constant equal to 96 485 c mol fig 2b illustrates the mass of coagulant adsorbent generation at different time intervals for instance the amount of coagulant at 110 min is 11 times higher than that of 10 min until 110 min the amount of coagulant was enough to remove both drugs while excess reaction time did not lead to higher removal because the solution reached the required coagulant thus more reaction time can be considered as a waste of energy considering a balance between removal efficiency and energy consumption 110 min was selected as the optimal electrolysis rime for the other experiments also the findings demonstrate that ibuprofen removal was approximately 3 times greater than acetaminophen in remediation processes reaching equilibrium in less time is an advantage and many scholars have investigated the effect of duration time a torrellas et al 2016 studied the removal of the pharmaceutical compound by adsorption process onto the multi walled carbon nanotubes and the equilibrium was attained within 5 h álvarez torrellas et al 2016 also mestre et al 2007 reported 120 min as the optimum contact time to remove the targeted drug by activated carbons mestre et al 2007 in another study the process reached the equilibrium state in 200 min coimbra et al 2019 in comparison to mentioned studies an electro duration of 110 min represents electrocoagulation as an efficient method for the pharmaceutical compounds removal compared to adsorption process 3 2 effect of the current electrode current influences the ir drop and the removal efficiency the experiments were done with al al combination and electrolysis time between 0 and 110 min pharmaceuticals concentration was 40 ppm at the initial step of the reactions fig 3 shows the removal efficiency for ibuprofen and acetaminophen by setting the current at 2 1 3 and 0 7 a the removal efficiency increases with the increase of current for both drugs at the duration time of 110 min the removal efficiency obtained 54 51 48 44 and 35 08 for ibuprofen with three different currents respectively in the case of acetaminophen it was 31 32 22 37 and 17 90 respectively the increase in the removal efficiency with the higher current is due to the higher coagulant and indeed more active sites for drug removal in fact more anode dissociation and thus more al ions are generated according to faraday s law more al production reacts with more oh ions to create al hydroxide acting as an adsorbent which is capable of adsorbing removing the pharmaceuticals at higher current smaller size h2 bubbles with the larger surface areas are expected which are also effective for drug elimination greater upward flux occurring at high current attributes the movement of the adsorbate toward coagulant agents resulting in performance enhancement at the reaction time 30 min and current 2 a the removal efficiency for ibuprofen was 32 66 however for an identical removal efficiency under current of 0 7 a electrolysis time of 80 min was required it demonstrates by increasing the current density lower contact time is needed to achieve a specific removal efficiency reducing the required electrolysis time is another benefit of elevated current as well as higher removal efficiency these findings demonstrated that at 2 a the removal efficiency of ibuprofen was 1 74 times greater than that of acetaminophen considering these facts further experiments were carried out at current 2 a many costs are involved in wastewater treatment processes including the cost of electrical energy electrode materials and equipment the consumed amount of energy during the process can be obtained by the following equation 3 3 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n w h l v i t v r where vr is the effluent volume l v is the observed cell voltage v i is the current a and t is electrocoagulation time h fig 3c shows the energy consumption during ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal as expected higher energy consumption is occurred in elevated current and of course it results in better efficiency of the system it is a must to make a balance between removal efficiency and energy consumption 3 3 effect of inter electrode distance the electrode distance has a significant influence on the removal efficiencies of ibuprofen and acetaminophen to investigate the effect of distance on the removal efficiency electrodes were kept at 3 5 and 6 cm accordingly the highest removal efficiency of ibuprofen 55 18 and acetaminophen 30 75 was observed at electrode distance of 3 cm however 6 cm showed the lowest values 35 02 and 20 25 respectively decreasing the removal efficiency with further distance is mainly due to the difficulty in the motion of ions in the solution khadir et al 2020e increment of ir drop by increasing the inter electrode distance could negatively affect the whole treatment process via electrocoagulation nasrullah et al 2012 moreover energy consumption was calculated in the examined electrode distances it was found that energy consumptions at electrode distances of 3 5 and 6 cm were 55 2 59 6 and 69 wh l respectively based on the obtained results the inter electrode distance was fixed at 3 cm for further experiments 3 4 effect of electrode material electrode material plays a huge role in the electrocoagulation process because it directly influences the coagulant generation and the removal efficiency because of this selection of proper materials is of high importance in this study the combinations of fe and al were utilized to examine which one has the best performance fig 4 a shows the removal efficiencies for each pair anode cathode to achieve the best electrode for removing acetaminophen and ibuprofen other parameters were kept at their optimum values with 110 min duration time and current 2 a the maximum removal efficiency for both acetaminophen and ibuprofen was achieved when al al electrode was used with 42 2 and 98 55 respectively from the result it can be concluded that the effect of anode material is more significant than the cathode material because the removal efficiency for both drugs was higher with al fe combination than fe al the reason for the higher removal efficiency of al al could be attributed to higher coagulation in the solution the same results were obtained when al electrodes were used for the removal of cod using pure al as an electrode resulted in the removal efficiency of 97 cruz et al 2019 similarly the removal of reactive black 5 improved successfully and reached 99 using al as electrode material in 10 min duration keyikoglu et al 2019 3 5 effect of ph in the field of chemistry ph of the solution is of the primary factor affecting the nature of the process beheshti et al 2019 ghenaatgar et al 2019 in view of electrocoagulation ph could affect the surface charges of the generated coagulant as well as the ionization degree of pharmaceuticals khadir et al 2020c the obtained results are depicted in fig 4b for both drugs the maximum removal efficiency was observed at initial ph value of 5 the figure shows that ph imposed significant effect on ibuprofen compared to acetaminophen this behavior may be attributed to the charges of the drug in the examined ph value phzpc is the point where the drug has no charge and in the case of ibuprofen and acetaminophen phzpc is 4 95 and 9 38 respectively nourmoradi et al 2018 it is indication of the fact that at ph lower than phzpc the compounds are in their non ionized forms however at ph phzpc they own mostly negative charges in the studied ph range acetaminophen is neutral and it is fair to suggest that its elimination is because of the physical sorption via coagulant surface ibuprofen was negative at ph 5 and coagulant was positive favoring to make an electrostatic attraction by elevating the ph value both drug and adsorbent coagulant possessed negative charges resulting in the lower removal efficiency because of the repulsion forces considering these results further experiments were conducted at ph 5 3 6 effect of agitation speed agitation speed is of the most important parameter directly affecting the rate of the reactions particularly in systems with particle involvement in the current investigation the effect of agitation speed was tested by changing its value from zero no agitation to 600 rpm the results are shown in fig 4c the curve demonstrated that by enhancing the agitation speed from 0 to 600 rpm the removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and acetaminophen initially increased very slightly and then reduced continuously increment in the removal efficiency is due to the collision of the coagulant and pharmaceuticals with each other providing a higher chance of connection also the agitation in the solution could reduce the removal efficiency of the method it can be suggested that once the solution is agitated the molecules of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were detached from the surface of the coagulant lowering the removal efficiency under this circumstance resulting flocs are encouraged to break up previous literature proves these findings mohammadi et al 2019 tezcan un et al 2016 d sivakumar et al 2017 expresses that high agitation speed was not beneficial for the removal of toc and cod sivakumar et al 2017 therefore agitation speed of 100 rpm could be nominated as the optimal value 3 7 double stage electrocoagulation in the current study the operational parameters in the electrocoagulation process were optimized electrolysis time 110 min current 2 a inter electrode distance 3 cm ph 5 agitation speed 100 rpm pharmaceutical concentration 40 ppm and al al combination and the removal efficiencies of 59 32 and 33 15 were achieved for ibuprofen and acetaminophen respectively to improve the efficiency of the process a double stage electrocoagulation unit was applied for the removal of ibuprofen and acetaminophen the process was conducted under the previously stated optimum conditions with an agitation speed of 100 rpm the results are illustrated in fig 4d it indicates that the performance of the process enhanced and it was found that ibuprofen was removed more than 75 from the solution and acetaminophen removal was almost about 50 g k singh et al 2019 also reported that dual stage electrocoagulation process could enhance the applicability of the treatment technique singh et al 2019 3 8 kinetic of electrocoagulation understanding the kinetics of the adsorption is essential for designing a reactor for the process the adsorption mechanism can determine the underlying mechanism which controls the rate of the adsorption electrocoagulation is almost the same as adsorption whereas in electrocoagulation instead of using the adsorbent the coagulant is produced to remove pharmaceutical compounds the removed amount of either ibuprofen or acetaminophen is proportional to the amount of generated flocs and the remained concentration of ibuprofen or acetaminophen at the time t the first order equation is based on the assumption that the rate at which vacant sites are filling is proportional to the number of vacant sites while in second order this rate is proportional to the square of the number of vacant sites the kinetic of the study was evaluated based on the first and second order kinetic models equations 4 7 are given below 4 d c a c t t d t k 1 c a c t 5 d c a c t t d t k 2 c a c t 2 6 l n a c t t l n a c t 0 k 1 t 7 1 a c t t 1 a c t 0 k 2 t k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are the first and second order kinetics models rate constants respectively a c t 0 is the initial concentration of acetaminophen and a c t t is the concentration of acetaminophen at the time t the above equations were used to study the kinetic behavior of ibuprofen removal by ec with i b u t and i b u 0 as the ibuprofen concentration at time t and at the beginning integrating equation 4 resulted in equation 6 in which l n a c t t has a linear relation with l n a c t 0 to figure out the suitable model which fits best with experimental data l n c t and 1 c t versus time were plotted and fig 5 shows these plots also the values of the rate constants and regression coefficients were obtained based on fig 5 and table 2 the second order can better describe the kinetics of the adsorption both for ibuprofen and acetaminophen for ibuprofen the r2 value for second order and first order was in the range of 0 9075 0 9813 and 0 7691 0 8802 respectively revealing that chemical reactions could be the main mechanism for ibuprofen removal the experimental results also proved similar observation as earlier mentioned ibuprofen tend to be removed via electrostatic attraction surprisingly acetaminophen resulted in almost very high r2 value both for first order 0 9829 0 9945 and second order 0 9927 09976 such inclination might be attributed to non ionic nature of the acetaminophen under the experimental conditions k values of the kinetic model were also calculated and were summarized in table 2 by increasing the current from 0 7 to 2 a in all cases the k value also increased which demonstrates the faster reaction rate of electrocoagulation in higher current values in the current effect section the results in 2 a were absolutely more satisfactory than that of 0 7 a in short it is better to propose the second order model as the best one describing the simultaneous removal of ibuprofen and acetaminophen by electrocoagulation 3 9 hydrogen gas production during hydrolysis in the electrocoagulation process for ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal h2 gas is generated at the cathode as the by product by equation 8 mena et al 2019 8 3 h 2 o 3 e 3 2 h 2 3 o h the evolution of the h2 gases could benefit the efficiency of the process as well as hydrogen recovery deghles and kurt 2017 suggested the utilization of the electrocoagulation as an effective wastewater treatment technique not only for aqueous decontamination but also it can be employed for recovery of hydrogen gas deghles 2017 khadir et al 2019 stated that these gases might be effective for pollutant removal and its generation is of high importance mohammadi et al 2019 equations 9 and 10 are employed to calculated the amount of h2 gas production and the power content of the collected h2 gas respectively hashim et al 2019 9 q h 2 j a t h f 10 p h 2 k w h q h 2 0 0678 where q h 2 mole is the amount of h2 produced mole j a m2 is the current density of the electrocoagulation process t s is the treatment time h 0 5 is the number of hydrogen molecules and f 96 500 is faraday s constant regarding fig 6 a an increase in the applied current resulted in higher h2 gas production and the maximum value was 0 068 mol at 2 a also the power content fig 6b of the collected h2 gas was found maximum at 2 a 5 79 kwh m3 such amount of energy could be take into account for various other applications similar observations were reported by s hashim et al 2019 hashim et al 2019 3 10 real wastewater to extend the application of electrocoagulation unit for the removal of pharmaceuticals the experiments were conducted over a real sample taken from well water of a university in tehran iran the main properties of the real water were as following cod and bod negligible ph 7 12 temperature 25 c ec 3810 μs cm tss 3270 mg g total hardness 1443 mg l carbonate na 657 mg l no3 81 mg l the operational parameters were set at the optimum values found during the optimization process the initial ibuprofen and acetaminophen concentration were both fixed at 40 ppm the results exhibited that ibuprofen removal reached 71 and of acetaminophen it was 32 respectively such reduction in removal efficiencies are logical and reported in previous literature by many scholars ghenaatgar et al 2019 mirjavadi et al 2019 piri et al 2020 the presence of other particles in wastewaters are the main reason in reducing the removal efficiency of the technique 3 11 the mechanism of removal the current investigation attempted to eliminate ibuprofen and acetaminophen from water by means of electrocoagulation unit the optimization procedure revealed that electrolysis time and current were the most two important parameters directly influenced the whole performance of the process the findings exhibited that the generation of more coagulant is beneficial in terms of pharmaceutical removal indicating the integral role of the coagulant fig 7 shows a schematic representation of ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal by electrocoagulation unit at the working ph ibuprofen is negatively charges and tend to be attracted by positively charged coagulant via electrostatic attraction in addition ibuprofen and acetaminophen molecules could precipitate on the surface of the coagulant resulting in the pharmaceutical removal sweep coagulation might also be effective for the removal process 4 conclusion in the present study electrocoagulation technique was utilized as a green water purification method for the simultaneous elimination of two common pharmaceuticals in water accordingly for the first time sample of the groundwater was used and the ibuprofen and acetaminophen were added to the media manually the optimization process showed that by increasing the contact time both ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal rate increased until it reached a semi constant trend higher current was favorable in terms of removal efficiency and the maximum removal was observed at 2 a al al electrode combination was the best choice for the removal also it was demonstrated that agitation could have positive and negative effects on the efficiency of the process the double stage electrocoagulation verified the removal efficiencies of 78 and 48 for ibuprofen and acetaminophen respectively the whole process followed second order rate in conclusion electrocoagulation could suggest cost effective opportunities as well as high removal efficiency for persistent organic compounds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12112,contamination of water with persistent pharmaceutical compounds has become an increasing concern of the current world and many studies have been working on the mitigation of such pollution groundwater a crucial water source has been contaminated with pharmaceuticals in the current study an electrocoagulation method has been used for the simultaneous removal of two common pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the first time the process was optimized via the one at a time method it was found that by increasing the contact time the removal efficiency of ibuprofen and acetaminophen reached 50 96 and 22 76 at electrolysis time of 110 min and pharmaceutical concentration of 40 ppm respectively the maximum efficiency was observed at 2 a electrode distance of 3 cm was superior to 5 and 6 cm optimum values of ph and agitation speed were seen at 5 and 200 rpm respectively to improve efficiency the double electrocoagulation stage was considered and the maximum adsorption efficiency of 78 and 48 respectively produced h2 gas is one of the other advantages of the electrocoagulation process therefore electrocoagulation can be suggested as a promising technique to eliminate pharmaceuticals from underground water graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocoagulation ibuprofen acetaminophen pharmaceutical 1 introduction the introduction of pharmaceutical waste into the environment has threatened humans so long inappropriate disposal manufacturing waste and uncontrolled consumption of drugs have resulted in pharmaceutical pollution in every aspect of the ecosystem ahmed 2017 khadir et al 2020a vatovec et al 2017 the presence and accumulation of biologically active drugs can cause serious harmful effects for the whole ecosystem increasing consumption of ibuprofen and acetaminophen by human beings results in the presence of these drugs in the surface and groundwater this presence has received increasing concern in recent years as these drugs are biologically active compounds with adverse effects for the environment khadir et al 2020b pires et al 2019 rabizadeh et al 2020 the importance of groundwater as vital source water for the ecosystem has been discussed well in the literature kubier et al 2019 machiwal et al 2018 anthropogenic activities have threatened the quality of the media as well as its quantity this could lead to the unavoidable fact that groundwater might not be appropriate for the direct use of humans atangana et al 2018 detection of pharmaceuticals in the groundwater has become a serious issue requiring further considerations in lagos state nigeria for instance ebele et al 2020 reported that a wide range of pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac glyburide naproxen nicotine codeine amoxicillin tramadol and gemfibrozil were detected in the groundwater ebele et al 2020 in the rural agricultural regions pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were detected lee et al 2019 in irrigated groundwater wells also pharmaceuticals were observed that the authors accused the wastewater contribution for groundwater pollution kibuye et al 2019 several other scholars szymczycha et al 2020 szymczycha et al 2020 gao et al 2020 gao et al 2020 l del rosario et al 2014 del rosario et al 2014 and n gottschall et al 2011 gottschall et al 2012 concluded that the presence of pharmaceutical compounds was evident indicative of potential groundwater contamination the trace amount of ibuprofen and acetaminophen has been detected in the waterways of many areas magadini et al 2020 yang et al 2016 the continuous exposure of the groundwater to pharmaceuticals specially ibuprofen and acetaminophen is assumed to arise critical health hazards in the upcoming future implementation of a proper and sustainable treatment method could be a promising solution for the current pharmaceutical pollution in the groundwater table 1 summarizes the advantages of common methods for pharmaceutical elimination lower quantity of sludge production low maintenance less power requirement lower cost and higher removal efficiency compared to conventional chemical coagulation are some of the main advantages of the electrocoagulation unit mohammadi et al 2019 three consecutive steps are involved in the electrocoagulation processes 1 electrochemical reactions 2 flotation 3 adsorption mohammadi et al 2019 this process creates metal ion complexes to destabilize colloids drugs in the aqueous solution in the case of groundwater electrocoagulation has been applied for the removal of almost common groundwater contaminants such as arsenic kobya et al 2020 and arsenite goren et al 2020 nitrate amarine et al 2020 perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids bao et al 2020 phosphates castañeda et al 2020 fluoride sandoval et al 2019 and chromium ali maitlo et al 2019 however few studies have been reported for the removal of pharmaceutical from groundwater by electrocoagulation in the current study for the first time simultaneous removal of acetaminophen act and ibuprofen ibu from groundwater by electrocoagulation technique was investigated the process was optimized by considering the effect of operational parameters including electrolysis time ph electrode materials agitation speed inter electrode distance and the current on the removal efficiency of the drugs moreover kinetics models were fitted with experimental data to identify the adsorption mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and equipment the standard drug of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were provided by temad pharmaceutical company located in iran fig 1 the electrodes aluminum and iron were supplied by a local market in tehran iran methanol and sodium chloride were purchased from merck company germany to adjust the ph of the solution naoh and hcl were employed purchased from merck company germany all the chemicals used during the study were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification solutions were prepared using deionized water uv spectrophotometer model dr6000 hach lang usa was utilized for the determination of pharmaceutical concentration the ph of the aqueous solution was set by 780 ph master metrohm switzerland 2 2 operating conditions experiments were conducted in an electrocoagulation reactor with iron and aluminum as electrodes cathode and anode a system in which simultaneous removal of acetaminophen and ibuprofen occurred was consisted of a 1 l breaker and two electrodes connected to a power supply with adjustable voltage and current the electrodes distance was 3 cm initially and for the simplicity of the process the ph was considered to be constant at the first step of the reaction some operating parameters in coagulation process for simultaneous removal of acetaminophen and ibuprofen were investigated including current inter electrode distance electrode material agitation speed and ph the dimensions of electrodes were 10 4 1 0 1 cm with the effective surface area of about 33 cm2 to remove the layers deposit on the electrodes they were washed with hcl solution then rubbed with sandpapers required samples were provided by a university in tehran iran to conduct the experiments the desired amount of drugs was added manually to the sample final concentrations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen were determined after each experiment for acetaminophen the maximum peak was observed at λ max 249 nm in which ibuprofen had the negligible absorbance the maximum peak for ibuprofen was recorded at λ max 222 nm to determine the concentration of each pharmaceutical in the mixture solution the beer lambert s law was used the electrocoagulation removal efficiency was calculated by equation 1 1 removal efficiency c f c i c i 100 where c f and c i are the final and initial concentration of the pharmaceutical respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrolysis time electrolysis duration is an underlying factor leading to a significant difference in the removal efficiency the initial concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen both were fixed at 40 ppm fig 2 illustrates the removal efficiency of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in different reaction time ranging from 0 to 180 min between electrolysis duration of 0 110 min the removal efficiency of acetaminophen increased and reached approximately 30 after 110 min further duration time did not affect the removal efficiency of acetaminophen the trend for the removal efficiency of ibuprofen shows a sharp increase until the reaction time of 15 min more increase in the removal efficiency of ibuprofen was observed up to 110 min the figure shows that both acetaminophen and ibuprofen have the same trend from 110 min to 180 min the improvement of efficiency by increasing the electrolysis time may be attributed to higher coagulant generation by time increment the produced amount of metal ions can be calculated by equation 2 2 m i t m f z where m is the molar mass of electrode g mol z and i are valency of the anode and the current a respectively f is the faraday s constant equal to 96 485 c mol fig 2b illustrates the mass of coagulant adsorbent generation at different time intervals for instance the amount of coagulant at 110 min is 11 times higher than that of 10 min until 110 min the amount of coagulant was enough to remove both drugs while excess reaction time did not lead to higher removal because the solution reached the required coagulant thus more reaction time can be considered as a waste of energy considering a balance between removal efficiency and energy consumption 110 min was selected as the optimal electrolysis rime for the other experiments also the findings demonstrate that ibuprofen removal was approximately 3 times greater than acetaminophen in remediation processes reaching equilibrium in less time is an advantage and many scholars have investigated the effect of duration time a torrellas et al 2016 studied the removal of the pharmaceutical compound by adsorption process onto the multi walled carbon nanotubes and the equilibrium was attained within 5 h álvarez torrellas et al 2016 also mestre et al 2007 reported 120 min as the optimum contact time to remove the targeted drug by activated carbons mestre et al 2007 in another study the process reached the equilibrium state in 200 min coimbra et al 2019 in comparison to mentioned studies an electro duration of 110 min represents electrocoagulation as an efficient method for the pharmaceutical compounds removal compared to adsorption process 3 2 effect of the current electrode current influences the ir drop and the removal efficiency the experiments were done with al al combination and electrolysis time between 0 and 110 min pharmaceuticals concentration was 40 ppm at the initial step of the reactions fig 3 shows the removal efficiency for ibuprofen and acetaminophen by setting the current at 2 1 3 and 0 7 a the removal efficiency increases with the increase of current for both drugs at the duration time of 110 min the removal efficiency obtained 54 51 48 44 and 35 08 for ibuprofen with three different currents respectively in the case of acetaminophen it was 31 32 22 37 and 17 90 respectively the increase in the removal efficiency with the higher current is due to the higher coagulant and indeed more active sites for drug removal in fact more anode dissociation and thus more al ions are generated according to faraday s law more al production reacts with more oh ions to create al hydroxide acting as an adsorbent which is capable of adsorbing removing the pharmaceuticals at higher current smaller size h2 bubbles with the larger surface areas are expected which are also effective for drug elimination greater upward flux occurring at high current attributes the movement of the adsorbate toward coagulant agents resulting in performance enhancement at the reaction time 30 min and current 2 a the removal efficiency for ibuprofen was 32 66 however for an identical removal efficiency under current of 0 7 a electrolysis time of 80 min was required it demonstrates by increasing the current density lower contact time is needed to achieve a specific removal efficiency reducing the required electrolysis time is another benefit of elevated current as well as higher removal efficiency these findings demonstrated that at 2 a the removal efficiency of ibuprofen was 1 74 times greater than that of acetaminophen considering these facts further experiments were carried out at current 2 a many costs are involved in wastewater treatment processes including the cost of electrical energy electrode materials and equipment the consumed amount of energy during the process can be obtained by the following equation 3 3 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n w h l v i t v r where vr is the effluent volume l v is the observed cell voltage v i is the current a and t is electrocoagulation time h fig 3c shows the energy consumption during ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal as expected higher energy consumption is occurred in elevated current and of course it results in better efficiency of the system it is a must to make a balance between removal efficiency and energy consumption 3 3 effect of inter electrode distance the electrode distance has a significant influence on the removal efficiencies of ibuprofen and acetaminophen to investigate the effect of distance on the removal efficiency electrodes were kept at 3 5 and 6 cm accordingly the highest removal efficiency of ibuprofen 55 18 and acetaminophen 30 75 was observed at electrode distance of 3 cm however 6 cm showed the lowest values 35 02 and 20 25 respectively decreasing the removal efficiency with further distance is mainly due to the difficulty in the motion of ions in the solution khadir et al 2020e increment of ir drop by increasing the inter electrode distance could negatively affect the whole treatment process via electrocoagulation nasrullah et al 2012 moreover energy consumption was calculated in the examined electrode distances it was found that energy consumptions at electrode distances of 3 5 and 6 cm were 55 2 59 6 and 69 wh l respectively based on the obtained results the inter electrode distance was fixed at 3 cm for further experiments 3 4 effect of electrode material electrode material plays a huge role in the electrocoagulation process because it directly influences the coagulant generation and the removal efficiency because of this selection of proper materials is of high importance in this study the combinations of fe and al were utilized to examine which one has the best performance fig 4 a shows the removal efficiencies for each pair anode cathode to achieve the best electrode for removing acetaminophen and ibuprofen other parameters were kept at their optimum values with 110 min duration time and current 2 a the maximum removal efficiency for both acetaminophen and ibuprofen was achieved when al al electrode was used with 42 2 and 98 55 respectively from the result it can be concluded that the effect of anode material is more significant than the cathode material because the removal efficiency for both drugs was higher with al fe combination than fe al the reason for the higher removal efficiency of al al could be attributed to higher coagulation in the solution the same results were obtained when al electrodes were used for the removal of cod using pure al as an electrode resulted in the removal efficiency of 97 cruz et al 2019 similarly the removal of reactive black 5 improved successfully and reached 99 using al as electrode material in 10 min duration keyikoglu et al 2019 3 5 effect of ph in the field of chemistry ph of the solution is of the primary factor affecting the nature of the process beheshti et al 2019 ghenaatgar et al 2019 in view of electrocoagulation ph could affect the surface charges of the generated coagulant as well as the ionization degree of pharmaceuticals khadir et al 2020c the obtained results are depicted in fig 4b for both drugs the maximum removal efficiency was observed at initial ph value of 5 the figure shows that ph imposed significant effect on ibuprofen compared to acetaminophen this behavior may be attributed to the charges of the drug in the examined ph value phzpc is the point where the drug has no charge and in the case of ibuprofen and acetaminophen phzpc is 4 95 and 9 38 respectively nourmoradi et al 2018 it is indication of the fact that at ph lower than phzpc the compounds are in their non ionized forms however at ph phzpc they own mostly negative charges in the studied ph range acetaminophen is neutral and it is fair to suggest that its elimination is because of the physical sorption via coagulant surface ibuprofen was negative at ph 5 and coagulant was positive favoring to make an electrostatic attraction by elevating the ph value both drug and adsorbent coagulant possessed negative charges resulting in the lower removal efficiency because of the repulsion forces considering these results further experiments were conducted at ph 5 3 6 effect of agitation speed agitation speed is of the most important parameter directly affecting the rate of the reactions particularly in systems with particle involvement in the current investigation the effect of agitation speed was tested by changing its value from zero no agitation to 600 rpm the results are shown in fig 4c the curve demonstrated that by enhancing the agitation speed from 0 to 600 rpm the removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and acetaminophen initially increased very slightly and then reduced continuously increment in the removal efficiency is due to the collision of the coagulant and pharmaceuticals with each other providing a higher chance of connection also the agitation in the solution could reduce the removal efficiency of the method it can be suggested that once the solution is agitated the molecules of ibuprofen and acetaminophen were detached from the surface of the coagulant lowering the removal efficiency under this circumstance resulting flocs are encouraged to break up previous literature proves these findings mohammadi et al 2019 tezcan un et al 2016 d sivakumar et al 2017 expresses that high agitation speed was not beneficial for the removal of toc and cod sivakumar et al 2017 therefore agitation speed of 100 rpm could be nominated as the optimal value 3 7 double stage electrocoagulation in the current study the operational parameters in the electrocoagulation process were optimized electrolysis time 110 min current 2 a inter electrode distance 3 cm ph 5 agitation speed 100 rpm pharmaceutical concentration 40 ppm and al al combination and the removal efficiencies of 59 32 and 33 15 were achieved for ibuprofen and acetaminophen respectively to improve the efficiency of the process a double stage electrocoagulation unit was applied for the removal of ibuprofen and acetaminophen the process was conducted under the previously stated optimum conditions with an agitation speed of 100 rpm the results are illustrated in fig 4d it indicates that the performance of the process enhanced and it was found that ibuprofen was removed more than 75 from the solution and acetaminophen removal was almost about 50 g k singh et al 2019 also reported that dual stage electrocoagulation process could enhance the applicability of the treatment technique singh et al 2019 3 8 kinetic of electrocoagulation understanding the kinetics of the adsorption is essential for designing a reactor for the process the adsorption mechanism can determine the underlying mechanism which

model which fits best with experimental data l n c t and 1 c t versus time were plotted and fig 5 shows these plots also the values of the rate constants and regression coefficients were obtained based on fig 5 and table 2 the second order can better describe the kinetics of the adsorption both for ibuprofen and acetaminophen for ibuprofen the r2 value for second order and first order was in the range of 0 9075 0 9813 and 0 7691 0 8802 respectively revealing that chemical reactions could be the main mechanism for ibuprofen removal the experimental results also proved similar observation as earlier mentioned ibuprofen tend to be removed via electrostatic attraction surprisingly acetaminophen resulted in almost very high r2 value both for first order 0 9829 0 9945 and second order 0

kwh m3 such amount of energy could be take into account for various other applications similar observations were reported by s hashim et al 2019 hashim et al 2019 3 10 real wastewater to extend the application of electrocoagulation unit for the removal of pharmaceuticals the experiments were conducted over a real sample taken from well water of a university in tehran iran the main properties of the real water were as following cod and bod negligible ph 7 12 temperature 25 c ec 3810 μs cm tss 3270 mg g total hardness 1443 mg l carbonate na 657 mg l no3 81 mg l the operational parameters were set at the optimum values found during the optimization process the initial ibuprofen and acetaminophen concentration were both fixed at 40 ppm the results exhibited that ibuprofen removal reached 71 and of acetaminophen it was 32 respectively such reduction in removal efficiencies are logical and reported in previous literature by many scholars ghenaatgar et al 2019 mirjavadi et al 2019 piri et al 2020 the presence of other particles in wastewaters are the main reason in reducing the removal efficiency of the technique 3 11 the mechanism of removal the current investigation attempted to eliminate ibuprofen and acetaminophen from water by means of electrocoagulation unit the optimization procedure revealed that electrolysis time and current were the most two important parameters directly influenced the whole performance of the process the findings exhibited that the generation of more coagulant is beneficial in terms of pharmaceutical removal indicating the integral role of the coagulant fig 7 shows a schematic representation of ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal by electrocoagulation unit at the working ph ibuprofen is negatively charges and tend to be attracted by positively charged coagulant via electrostatic attraction in addition ibuprofen and acetaminophen molecules could precipitate on the surface of the coagulant resulting in the pharmaceutical removal sweep coagulation might also be effective for the removal process 4 conclusion in the present study electrocoagulation technique was utilized as a green water purification method for the simultaneous elimination of two common pharmaceuticals in water accordingly for the first time sample of the groundwater was used and the ibuprofen and acetaminophen were added to the media manually the optimization process showed that by increasing the contact time both ibuprofen and acetaminophen removal rate increased until it reached a semi constant trend higher current was favorable in terms of removal efficiency and the maximum removal was observed at 2 a al al electrode combination was the best choice for the removal also it was demonstrated that agitation could have positive and negative effects on the efficiency of the process the double stage electrocoagulation verified the removal efficiencies of 78 and 48 for ibuprofen and acetaminophen respectively the whole process followed second order rate in conclusion electrocoagulation could suggest cost effective opportunities as well as high removal efficiency for persistent organic compounds declaration of competing interest the

out to understand the status of groundwater quality and possible causes for high fluoride concentrations 34 groundwater samples were collected from dausa district of rajasthan analysed results show that the fluoride concentration ranged between 0 48 and 3 64 mg l with an average of 1 66 mg l in groundwater of study area fluoride concentrations in about 82 of the samples are more than the

mechanisms play a significant role for fluoride contamination of groundwater marghade et al 2018 used the various hydrogeochemical tools such as groundwater type geochemical evolution of fluoride groundwater ion exchange process saturation indices geochemical modelling and pollution index of groundwater pig in this study it was concluded that the enrichment of fluoride was mainly controlled by geologic and hydrogeological conditions fluoride bearing minerals and their dissolution precipitation under the alkaline environment further the ion exchange process anthropogenic inputs and pollution

geospatial modelling technique for delineation of fluoride contamination zone within dwarka basin birbhum india and concluded that the use of remote sensing and gis generate basic preliminary ideas of the probable contamination site of groundwater with fluoride since no major studies were conducted focusing on dausa district the present study seeks to understand groundwater quality in this area and to assess the possible causes for high concentration of fluoride in groundwater further assessment is done to check the suitability of groundwater for industrial purpose using corrosivity ratio 2 study area dausa district of rajasthan state lies between 26⁰ 22 13 32 to 27⁰ 14 33 58 north latitude and 76⁰ 08 32 62 to 77⁰ 05 00 41 east longitude covering an area of 3420 km2 fig 1 the population of the district is 1 317 063 out of which 1 181 245 89 69 in the rural and 1 35 818 10 31 in the urban area census 2011 there are three important river basins banganga basin forming 62 89 in the upper northern part morel basin 34 27 occupying the southern part and very small part by ghambhir basin encompassing 2 84 in the south of mahwa agriculture activity is spread over both kharif and rabi cultivation kharif cultivation is rainfed and rabi cultivation is groundwater based 2 1 climatic conditions the climate of the district can be classified as semi arid in nature due to marked diurnal differences of temperature and low moderate rainfall it is markedly periodic and is characterized by a dry and gradually increasing hot season between march and may a dry and cold winter from october to february but a monsoon period from june to september the minimum and maximum temperature recorded in the study area is below 10 c in the month of january up to 48 c in the month of june respectively the total annual potential evapo transpiration is 1744 7 mm cgwb 2008 it implies that a discrepancy between rainfall and evapotranspiration lead the degradation of groundwater quality 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the dausa district forms part of eastern rajasthan upland it consists of open undulating plain and hillocks in the south eastern and northern part of the district aravalli hill systems are found in lalsot toda bhim blocks having a relative height of over 200 m cgwb 2017 geologically 15 35 of the district is occupied by the bhilwara super group rocks which consists of gneisses schist and migmatites these gneisses are overlain by rocks of delhi super group comprising raialo and alwar groups raialo group of rocks which consists of dolomite marble are present in small proportion in the north western part of dausa block the alwar group of rocks comprise of quartzite and schist alluvium and wind blown sand occupy parts of the district within mahwa and lalsot block in the north eastern and south western parts of the district 3 4th part of the district is occupied by quaternary alluvium younger alluvium 21 6 and older alluvium 58 4 which consists of slit sand gravel and occasional pebbles of aeolian and fluvial origin the weathered fractured and jointed hard rock forms aquifer in hard rock areas quartzite contributes to about 9 of aquifer in the district and rest of 5 3 is occupied by gneisses and phyllite aquifers groundwater occurs under unconfined to confined condition in the primary porosity i e pore spaces 3 methodology groundwater samples were collected by groundwater department rajasthan from 34 sites which consist of shallow hand pumps and tube wells in polypropylene bottles during april may 2015 the location of sampling sites is shown in fig 1 for sample collection and analysis procedure as suggested by trivedy and goel 1984 and american public health association apha 1985 are followed prior to collection the containers were thoroughly washed with diluted hno3 acid and then with distilled water in the laboratory before filling with the samples each container was rinsed to avoid any possible contamination every other precautionary measure is taken the hydro physical parameters electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in situ using portable kits likes conductivity and ph meters total hardness of caco3 calcium ca 2 bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl were analysed by volumetric analysis magnesium mg 2 was calculated from th and ca 2 contents sodium na and potassium k were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas sulphate so4 2 and nitrate no3 were determined by spectrophotometer technique fluoride f was determined by a fluoride ion meter all concentrations are expressed in milligram per litre mg l except ph and ec the analytical precision for the measurements of cations and anions indicated by the ionic balance error ibe was commuted on the basis of ions expressed in meq l and the formula used was as below 1 ibe cations anions cations anions 100 mandel and shiftan 1980 reported that the value of ibe should be observed to be within limit of 5 and celesceri et al 1998 reported to be within 10 few low concentrated values have shown minor deviations the extent of ion exchange reactions between groundwater and the aquifer minerals was evaluated by chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii as estimated by the following equation 2 cai i cl na k cl 3 cai ii cl na k hco 3 so 4 2 co 3 2 no 3 4 2 na cax 2 ca 2 2 nax 5 ca 2 2nax 2 na cax 2 maps were drawn using arcgis spatial analyst tool with inverse distance weighted idw technique to interpolate dataset idw assumes that the surface is being driven by local variation it found suitable since sample points are evenly distributed throughout the area and are not clustered 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydro geochemistry the important use of water analyses in groundwater hydrology is to give information about the water quality the groundwater quality is very important for determining its suitability for drinking and domestic agricultural and industrial purpose the minimum maximum average and standard deviation concentration of physicochemical parameters of water quality such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th and major cations and anions are presented in table 1 groundwater samples of the study area are alkaline in nature ph values ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 with average value of 8 2 represent alkaline conditions dominant within groundwater system in the dausa district electrical conductivity varied from 360 to 4200 μs cm with average value of 1714 μs cm the ec was above the maximum permissible 1400 μs cm in 48 57 of groundwater samples as per who 2009 standards except two almost all the samples exceed the desirable limit for ec 500 μs cm the higher ec may cause a gastrointestinal irritation in human beings ullah et al 2017 whitford 2011 das et al 1994 although the large variation in ec is mainly attributed to geochemical process like ion exchange reverse exchange evaporation silicate weathering rock water interaction sulphate reduction and oxidation processes ramesh 2008 whereas tds varied from 258 to 2460 mg l the distribution of tds values clearly shows that the entire study area falls high range because due to salt encrustations fig 2 the hardness values ranged from 160 to 675 mg l with an average value 356 mg l the cations are dominated by na 27 770 with an average of 244 51 mg l followed by ca 2 10 64 with an average of 32 51 mg l mg 2 28 142 with an average of 66 94 mg l and k 01 30 with an average of 6 51 mg l among the anion chemistry hco3 146 1013 with an average of 442 46 mg l is the dominant ion which is followed by cl 35 858 with an average of 262 23 mg l so4 2 0 490 with an average of 92 46 mg l co3 2 0 288 with an average of 39 77 mg l no3 01 145 with an average of 33 09 mg l and f 0 48 3 64 with an average of 1 65 mg l the availability of na and hco3 ions in groundwater may be due to weathering of halites and dissolution of silicate and minerals as weak acids dissolve carbon dioxide from air to form carbonic acid subba rao 2002 subba et al 2017 the dominances of cations and anions are found in the following order na mg 2 ca 2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 f respectively 4 2 ion exchange processes chloro alkaline indices the positive correlations table 2 between cl 0 90 and na 0 97 with ec show that dissolution of ion from rocks is the major controlling factor of ec in the present study hco3 ca 2 and na ca 2 ratio except one sample it was found to be much greater than unity which shows that the ion exchange also controls the fluoride content in groundwater the extent of ion exchange reactions between groundwater and the aquifer minerals was evaluated by chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii the chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii are suggested by schoeller 1967 which indicate ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment during residence or travel if there are na and k ions in the water which are exchanged with mg 2 and ca 2 ions the indices are positive indicating the direct base exchange reaction or chloroalkaline equilibrium in contrast if the exchange is in the reverse order then the exchange is indirect and the indices are found to be negative indicating chloro alkaline disequilibrium these reactions are known as cation anion exchange reaction viz ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment during residence or travel in the subsurface the positive value of cai i and cai ii in 52 94 of the total groundwater samples in table 3 fig 3 indicates reverse ion exchange in the groundwater and found in areas with high fluoride concentrations the rest of the groundwater samples 47 06 had negative value due to an exchange of ca 2 and mg 2 from the water with na k of the host rock and found in the areas with low fluoride concentrations fig 3 4 3 spatial distribution of fluoride and its contamination the desirable range of fluoride concentration in drinking water is 0 6 1 2 mg l of indian standard i e maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l based on bis bureau of indian standards 1991 and 1 5 mg l based on who 2009 whereas a dose lower than 0 6 mg l in water promote tooth decay when consumed in high dose 1 5 mg l it leads to dental fluorosis and excessively high concentration 3 0 mg l may lead to skeletal fluorosis based on fluoride concentration and different medical conditions associated with it the groundwater samples are classified in four subgroups namely a low 0 6 mg l b good 0 6 1 5 mg l c high 1 5 3 mg l and d very high 3 mg l fig 4 shows the average concentration of fluoride in groundwater present in different sampling locations in the southern part mandawari and in western part dausa has low fluoride 0 6 mg l and in 16 points including baniyana kundal sainthal etc in western part fluoride concentration is found in the range of good category 0 6 1 5 mg l in 11 points fluoride concentration is found in the range of high category 1 5 3 mg l and 3 samples in nahara pakhara and saleempur eastern and north eastern parts fluoride concentration is found very high range of 3 mg l in groundwater samples from only 3 locations showed fluoride concentration lower than 0 6 mg l whereas 50 of samples showed groundwater to be fit for drinking total of 14 samples registers a higher concentration of fluoride 4 4 sources of fluoride 4 4 1 weathering of rocks the bedrock of the study area is granite gneisses which has fluoride containing minerals such as fluorite 0 3 3 biotite 0 1 1 7 and hornblende 0 1 1 1 rao et al 1993 these bedrocks are overlain by delhi super group having quartzite and schists having high concentration of biotite and muscovite having high solubility hence the major reason for elevated fluoride concentration in the study area can be attributed to weathering of rocks or rock water interactions the hydrogeological description by cgwb 2017 shows that quartzite rocks are exposed to the surface in the eastern and northern parts and these are regions where an elevated fluoride concentration is recorded fig 4 central part of the district forms the watershed region of banganga river and thus having alluvial plain with low to average fluoride concentration while the foothills of the exposed hills constitutes tallus and scree deposits form minor aquifer occurring on the flanks of almost all the hills since the water is in flowing condition and aquifers have higher transmissivity in this area decreasing the groundwater residence time so average to high fluoride concentrations are found cgwb 2017 the zone of high fluoride concentrations in eastern and western parts of the district dominated by alluvium shows an excessive decline in water table and hence groundwater comes from deeper aquifer which shows an imprint of rock water interaction gibbs diagrams figs 5 and 6 are drawn for cations and anions tds v s na na ca and tds v s cl cl hco3 found in the study area it represents rock water interaction and rocks as controlling factors for tds in the study area ph value ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 with an average value 8 22 table 1 it means that the groundwater in the study area is alkaline in all the places generally a higher value of ph favours the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater as oh replaces f of clay minerals which as can be seen from fig 7 this indicates that the fluoride content of groundwater has increased due to increase in ph values when groundwater with an elevated ph interacts with underlying rocks the oh replaces the fluoride causing an enrichment in fluoride content the interactions of groundwater and rocks such as biotite muscovite and fluorite are explained in equations 6 9 6 kmg 3 alsi 3 o 10 f 2 2 oh kmg 3 alsi 3 o 10 oh 2 2 f co 2 biotite 7 kal 2 alsi 3 o 10 f 2

indices table 3 indicates fluoride enrichment in the groundwater the alkaline groundwater ph 7 8 8 5 environment with a high hco3 content was responsible for dissolution of f in groundwater subba rao 2006 adimalla and qian 2019 adimalla and li 2019 adimalla 2020 rao et al 1993 suggested that the alkalinity in terms of hco3 activates the processes of dissociation and dissolution of f from the soil and weathered rocks with a simultaneous precipitation of caco3 and a reduction of th in terms of ca 2 and mg 2 ions the hco3 had positive correlation with f r 0 44 and th had a negative relation with f r 0 30 when groundwater comes in contact with rocks containing albite minerals the groundwater becomes enriched in na as shown explained by the following equation 10 10 2 na alsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o 2 na 2 hco 3 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 mg 2 4 h 4 sio 4 albite the mineral albite may be the possible source of excess na over cl li et al 2014 further the clays were the sources of both na and cl ions todd 1980 hem 1991 the groundwater rich in na had a significant contribution in the controlling of groundwater f geochemistry the high f load could had been attributed to the high na and low ca 2 contents in groundwater ahada and suthar 2018 the evidence of this statement had been observed by a positive correlation between na and f r 0 14 the increase of hco3 decreased the f content in the groundwater of the present study area due to leaching of precipitated secondary salts chidambaram et al 2013 the negative correlation between fluoride and both calcium and magnesium 0 13 and 0 28 indicated the precipitation of caf2 and mgf2 due to abundance of calcium and magnesium li et al 2018 jack et al 2005 reported sepiolite and palygorskite as mg sinks in rajasthan responsible for release of f under alkaline conditions the negative correlation between f and no3 r 0 24 indicates geogenic sources responsible for fluoride levels in groundwater rather than anthropogenic activities in the study area the presence of high hco3 na and ph favours the release of fluoride from aquifer matrix into groundwater f anion sorbed onto positively charged surfaces and show greater desorption at higher ph it was observed that the groundwater in study area was alkaline so the solubility of fluoride bearing minerals had been increased in groundwater kumar et al 2017 4 5 groundwater fluctuation and fluoride the concentration of fluoride in groundwater tends to increase in the pre monsoon march to may period where the seasonal fluctuation in fluoride concentration follows the groundwater level fluctuation fig 8 the groundwater level shows a rise in post monsoon season because of rainfall recharge if we look at the yearly trend of groundwater in the district we see that there is continuous decrease in level and thus the problem of fluoride goes on increasing with time the continuous decline of water table in the region can be associated with increase in pumping 4 6 anthropogenic reasons for fluoride increase the region which registers high fluoride concentration is dominated by medium brown sandy soil and deep dark brown sandy soil fig 4 agriculture is main economic activity two crops kharif and rabi are generally grown in the district but more than three crops are grown in the region dominated with high level of fluoride kharif crop is mostly rain fed whereas the rabi and zaid crops are irrigated with groundwater since the fluoride content is higher in pre monsoon season irrigation can be associated with rise in fluoride content fig 4 since irrigation is available in the rabi seasons the fertilizers are also applied in these seasons only these fertilizers are also expected to contribute towards high fluoride concentration 4 7 water suitability for industrial purpose the industrial suitability of groundwater resources besides agriculture and domestic use jasrotia et al 2019 is very important task for today the evaluation must consider adverse effects in term of corrosion and incrustation properties of water raghunath 1982 karanth 1987 das et al 2016 therefore a detailed assessment of groundwater resources in dausa district was carried out and identified the incrustation and corrosive in nature generally parameters such as ph ec cl so4 2 and hco3 are responsible for corrosive and incrustation behaviour of groundwater anonymous 1983 the mechanism of corrosion is electrochemical in nature where the solution of iron forms ferrous ion in anodic areas and release electrons that flow to cathodic area in an iron chemical process the hydrogen ion is neutralized and causes atomic hydrogen to plate out on the metal surface clark and barnes 1969 the reduction of sulphide compounds is also a relevant aspect of groundwater incrustation and corrosion processes clarke and barnes 1964 when addressing iron the stepwise reduction of sulphate is given by mckinney 1962 11 the sulphate reducing organism catalyzes the combination of atomic hydrogen with sulphate and it removes the protective layer of hydrogen from the cathode and allows the corrosion clark and barnes 1969 in the study area the ec values were low 1500 μs cm in 52 94 samples and were high 1500 μs cm in 47 05 of groundwater samples table 4 high values of ec in groundwater samples were responsible for the corrosive nature and low value of ec in groundwater samples for non corrosive nature the chloride content in groundwater was mainly influenced by leaching of industrial effluent most of the groundwater samples 85 29 fallen in low chloride concentration 500 mg l and it was non corrosive nature only 14 70 of samples fallen in high chloride concentration 500 mg l and it was corrosive nature the incrustation was very hard cement like layer which was not harmful because it protects the corrosion the adverse effect that was created the deposition of heavy incrustation it leads to reduction of the water carrying capacity of pipes it was caused by precipitation of carbonates of calcium and magnesium or their sulphate and silicates agrawal 2012 in the study area the majority of samples 67 65 fallen in non incrusting type only few 32 35 of samples fallen in hard incrusting type the corrosive nature of water based on the relative abundance of a strong acid to weak acid was calculated by following equation ryznar 1944 raman 1985 12 corrosivity ratio cr 0 028 cl 0 021 so 4 2 0 02 hco 3 co 3 2 4 8 concentration are expressed in mg l the values of cr 1 0 are suitable for industrial processes due to non corrosive nature of water in the study area the majority 64 70 of samples were fallen in this category the value of cr 1 0 were not suitable for industrial processes due to corrosion of metal from water in the study area only small 35 30 of samples fallen in this category the remedial measures for problematic aquifer include boiling of water to reduce conduit incrustation or the use of fiber glass plastic pvc pipes and stainless pipe to mitigate the corrosion and incrustation 5 conclusions groundwater quality has been evaluated specially in terms of fluoride concentration and its sources in a semi arid area dausa district rajasthan it has been concluded that fluoride contamination in groundwater of the study area mainly depends on fluoride bearing minerals and their interaction with water the main sources of fluoride identified are decomposition dissociation and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals such as biotite and muscovite a seasonal variability in fluoride concentration can also observed which can be associated with rainfall recharge and pumping for irrigation the high alkalinity is also the factor of high contamination of fluoride the groundwater chemistry is mainly depending on the presence of cations and anions pearson s correlation coefficients and chloroalkaline indices are used to evaluate geochemistry of fluoride contaminated groundwater the order of major cations and anions are na mg 2 ca 2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 f respectively in the study area the presence of high hco3 na and ph favours the release of fluoride from aquifer matrix into groundwater the high ec is also mainly attributed to geochemical process like ion exchange reverse exchange evaporation silicate weathering and rock water interaction in the study area the tool corrosivity ratio cr is used for water suitability for the industrial purposes the corrosive nature and incrustation are mainly depending for the parameters such as ph ec cl so4 2 and hco3 the high na ca 2 and hco3 ca 2 ratios along with high tds also confirm the fluoride contamination in groundwater in the study area periodical monitoring is essential to assess the groundwater quality the constructing artificial recharge structures are essential to improve the fluoride concentration in groundwater in the study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

comes from weathering of rocks this finding is further supported by scholler chloro alkaline indices and high na ca 2 ratio 1 0 suggesting ion exchange the high fluoride content render the water unfit

2017 ali et al 2018 2019 arya et al 2019 aravinthasamy et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 karunanidhi et al 2019 2020a 2010b aullón alcaine et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 studied fluoride concentration in northern tanzania and found that due to geological variations 96 of water sources in hotspots have concentrations more than permissible limit of 1 5 mg l while cool spots have extremely low concentrations below 0 5 mg l which is not safe for drinking vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 reported that geology rock types residence time aquifer depth and weathering intensity resulted in variations in fluoride contents of african groundwater in indian conditions jacks et al 2005 reported that the high fluoride concentration groundwater in many parts of india may be due to i evapotranspiration of groundwater with residual alkalinity ii difference in sequences of secondary precipitates iii alkalinisation of soils mamatha and rao 2010 adimalla and qian 2019 adimalla and li 2019 studied the factor responsible for fluoride content in groundwater from a part of kolar and tumkur district of karnataka india and found that the dry climate the origin and geochemical mechanisms play a significant role for fluoride contamination of groundwater marghade et al 2018 used the various hydrogeochemical tools such as groundwater type geochemical evolution of fluoride groundwater ion exchange process saturation indices geochemical modelling and pollution index of groundwater pig in this study it was concluded that the enrichment of fluoride was mainly controlled by geologic and hydrogeological conditions fluoride bearing minerals and their dissolution precipitation under the alkaline environment further the ion exchange process anthropogenic inputs and pollution index of groundwater affect the contamination of fluoride rao et al 2014 assessed the regional appraisal of fluoride occurrence in groundwater of andhra pradesh india and observed the fluoride rich minerals as the main sources and residence time evapotranspiration and weathering processes as the supplementary factors for higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater thapa et al 2017 applied geospatial modelling technique for delineation of fluoride contamination zone within dwarka basin birbhum india and concluded that the use of remote sensing and gis generate basic preliminary ideas of the probable contamination site of groundwater with fluoride since no major studies were conducted focusing on dausa district the present study seeks to understand groundwater quality in this area and to assess the possible causes for high concentration of fluoride in groundwater further assessment is done to check the suitability of groundwater for industrial purpose using corrosivity ratio 2 study area dausa district of rajasthan state lies between 26⁰ 22 13 32 to 27⁰ 14 33 58 north latitude and 76⁰ 08 32 62 to 77⁰ 05 00 41 east longitude covering an area of 3420 km2 fig 1 the population of the district is 1 317 063 out of which 1 181 245 89 69 in the rural and 1 35 818 10 31 in the urban area census 2011 there are three important river basins banganga basin forming 62 89 in the upper northern part morel basin 34 27 occupying the southern part and very small part by ghambhir basin encompassing 2 84 in the south of mahwa agriculture activity is spread over both kharif and rabi cultivation kharif cultivation is rainfed and rabi cultivation is groundwater based 2 1 climatic conditions the climate of the district can be classified as semi arid in nature due to marked diurnal differences of temperature and low moderate rainfall it is markedly periodic and is characterized by a dry and gradually increasing hot season between march and may a dry and cold winter from october to february but a monsoon period from june to september the minimum and maximum temperature recorded in the study area is below 10 c in the month of january up to 48 c in the month of june respectively the total annual potential evapo transpiration is 1744 7 mm cgwb 2008 it implies that a discrepancy between rainfall and evapotranspiration lead the degradation of groundwater quality 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the dausa district forms part of eastern rajasthan upland it consists of open undulating plain and hillocks in the south eastern and northern part of the district aravalli hill systems are found in lalsot toda bhim blocks having a relative height of over 200 m cgwb 2017 geologically 15 35 of the district is occupied by the bhilwara super group rocks which consists of gneisses schist and migmatites these gneisses are overlain by rocks of delhi super group comprising raialo and alwar groups raialo group of rocks which consists of dolomite marble are present in small proportion in the north western part of dausa block the alwar group of rocks comprise of quartzite and schist alluvium and wind blown sand occupy parts of the district within mahwa and lalsot block in the north eastern and south western parts of the district 3 4th part of the district is occupied by quaternary alluvium younger alluvium 21 6 and older alluvium 58 4 which consists of slit sand gravel and occasional pebbles of aeolian and fluvial origin the weathered fractured and jointed hard rock forms aquifer in hard rock areas quartzite contributes to about 9 of aquifer in the district and rest of 5 3 is occupied by gneisses and phyllite aquifers groundwater occurs under unconfined to confined condition in the primary porosity i e pore spaces 3 methodology groundwater samples were collected by groundwater department rajasthan from 34 sites which consist of shallow hand pumps and tube wells in polypropylene bottles during april may 2015 the location of sampling sites is shown in fig 1 for sample collection and analysis procedure as suggested by trivedy and goel 1984 and american public health association apha 1985 are followed prior to collection the containers were thoroughly washed with diluted hno3 acid and then with distilled water in the laboratory before filling with the samples each container was rinsed to avoid any possible contamination every other precautionary measure is taken the hydro physical parameters electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in situ using portable kits likes conductivity and ph meters total hardness of caco3 calcium ca 2 bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl were analysed by volumetric analysis magnesium mg 2 was calculated from th and ca 2 contents sodium na and potassium k were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas sulphate so4 2 and nitrate no3 were determined by spectrophotometer technique fluoride f was determined by a fluoride ion meter all concentrations are expressed in milligram per litre mg l except ph and ec the analytical precision for the measurements of cations and anions indicated by the ionic balance error ibe was commuted on the basis of ions expressed in meq l and the formula used was as below 1 ibe cations anions cations anions 100 mandel and shiftan 1980 reported that the value of ibe should be observed to be within limit of 5 and celesceri et al 1998 reported to be within 10 few low concentrated values have shown minor deviations the extent of ion exchange reactions between groundwater and the aquifer minerals was evaluated by chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii as estimated by the following equation 2 cai i cl na k cl 3 cai ii cl na k hco 3 so 4 2 co 3 2 no 3 4 2 na cax 2 ca 2 2 nax 5 ca 2 2nax 2 na cax 2 maps were drawn using arcgis spatial analyst tool with inverse distance weighted idw technique to interpolate dataset idw assumes that the surface is being driven by local variation it found suitable since sample points are evenly distributed throughout the area and are not clustered 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydro geochemistry the important use of water analyses in groundwater hydrology is to give information about the water quality the groundwater quality is very important for determining its suitability for drinking and domestic agricultural and industrial purpose the minimum maximum average and standard deviation concentration of physicochemical parameters of water quality such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th and major cations and anions are presented in table 1 groundwater samples of the study area are alkaline in nature ph values ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 with average value of 8 2 represent alkaline conditions dominant within groundwater system in the dausa district electrical conductivity varied from 360 to 4200 μs cm with average value of 1714 μs cm the ec was above the maximum permissible 1400 μs cm in 48 57 of groundwater samples as per who 2009 standards except two almost all the samples exceed the desirable limit for ec 500 μs cm the higher ec may cause a gastrointestinal irritation in human beings ullah et al 2017 whitford 2011 das et al 1994 although the large variation in ec is mainly attributed to geochemical process like ion exchange reverse exchange evaporation silicate weathering rock water interaction sulphate reduction and oxidation processes ramesh 2008 whereas tds varied from 258 to 2460 mg l the distribution of tds values clearly shows that the entire study area falls high range because due to salt encrustations fig 2 the hardness values ranged from 160 to 675 mg l with an average value 356 mg l the cations are dominated by na 27 770 with an average of 244 51 mg l followed by ca 2 10 64 with an average of 32 51 mg l mg 2 28 142 with an average of 66 94 mg l and k 01 30 with an average of 6 51 mg l among the anion chemistry hco3 146 1013 with an average of 442 46 mg l is the dominant ion which is followed by cl 35 858 with an average of 262 23 mg l so4 2 0 490 with an average of 92 46 mg l co3 2 0 288 with an average of 39 77 mg l no3 01 145 with an average of 33 09 mg l and f 0 48 3 64 with an average of 1 65 mg l the availability of na and hco3 ions in groundwater may be due to weathering of halites and dissolution of silicate and minerals as weak acids dissolve carbon dioxide from air to form carbonic acid subba rao 2002 subba et al 2017 the dominances of cations and anions are found in the following order na mg 2 ca 2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 f respectively 4 2 ion exchange processes chloro alkaline indices the positive correlations table 2 between cl 0 90 and na 0 97 with ec show that dissolution of ion from rocks is the major controlling factor of ec in the present study hco3 ca 2 and na ca 2 ratio except one sample it was found to be much greater than unity which shows that the ion exchange also controls the fluoride content in groundwater the extent of ion exchange reactions between groundwater and the aquifer minerals was evaluated by chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii the chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii are suggested by schoeller 1967 which indicate ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment during residence or travel if there are na and k ions in the water which are exchanged with mg 2 and ca 2 ions the indices are positive indicating the direct base exchange reaction or chloroalkaline equilibrium in contrast if the exchange is in the reverse order then the exchange is indirect and the indices are found to be negative indicating chloro alkaline disequilibrium these reactions are known as cation anion exchange reaction viz ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment during residence or travel in the subsurface the positive value of cai i and cai ii in 52 94 of the total groundwater samples in table 3 fig 3 indicates reverse ion exchange in the groundwater and found in areas with high fluoride concentrations the rest of the groundwater samples 47 06 had negative value due to an exchange of ca 2 and mg 2 from the water with na k of the host rock and found in the areas with low fluoride concentrations fig 3 4 3 spatial distribution of fluoride and its contamination the desirable range of fluoride concentration in drinking water is 0 6 1 2 mg l of indian standard i e maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l based on bis bureau of indian standards 1991 and 1 5 mg l based on who 2009 whereas a dose lower than 0 6 mg l in water promote tooth decay when consumed in high dose 1 5 mg l it leads to dental fluorosis and excessively high concentration 3 0 mg l may lead to skeletal fluorosis based on fluoride concentration and different medical conditions associated with it the groundwater samples are classified in four subgroups namely a low 0 6 mg l b good 0 6 1 5 mg l c high 1 5 3 mg l and d very high 3 mg l fig 4 shows the average concentration of fluoride in groundwater present in different sampling locations in the southern part mandawari and in western part dausa has low fluoride 0 6 mg l and in 16 points including baniyana kundal sainthal etc in western part fluoride concentration is found in the range of good category 0 6 1 5 mg l in 11 points fluoride concentration is found in the range of high category 1 5 3 mg l and 3 samples in nahara pakhara and saleempur eastern and north eastern parts fluoride concentration is found very high range of 3 mg l in groundwater samples from only 3 locations showed fluoride concentration lower than 0 6 mg l whereas 50 of samples showed groundwater to be fit for drinking total of 14 samples registers a higher concentration of fluoride 4 4 sources of fluoride 4 4 1 weathering of rocks the bedrock of the study area is granite gneisses which has fluoride containing minerals such as fluorite 0 3 3 biotite 0 1 1 7 and hornblende 0 1 1 1 rao et al 1993 these bedrocks are overlain by delhi super group having quartzite and schists having high concentration of biotite and muscovite having high solubility hence the major reason for elevated fluoride concentration in the study area can be attributed to weathering of rocks or rock water interactions the hydrogeological description by cgwb 2017 shows that quartzite rocks are exposed to the surface in the eastern and northern parts and these are regions where an elevated fluoride concentration is recorded fig 4 central part of the district forms the watershed region of banganga river and thus having alluvial plain with low to average fluoride concentration while the foothills of the exposed hills constitutes tallus and scree deposits form minor aquifer occurring on the flanks of almost all the hills since the water is in flowing condition and aquifers have higher transmissivity in this area decreasing the groundwater residence time so average to high fluoride concentrations are found cgwb 2017 the zone of high fluoride concentrations in eastern and western parts of the district dominated by alluvium shows an excessive decline in water table and hence groundwater comes from deeper aquifer which shows an imprint of rock water interaction gibbs diagrams figs 5 and 6 are drawn for cations and anions tds v s na na ca and tds v s cl cl hco3 found in the study area it represents rock water interaction and rocks as controlling factors for tds in the study area ph value ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 with an average value 8 22 table 1 it means that the groundwater in the study area is alkaline in all the places generally a higher value of ph favours the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater as oh replaces f of clay minerals which as can be seen from fig 7 this indicates that the fluoride content of groundwater has increased due to increase in ph values when groundwater with an elevated ph interacts with underlying rocks the oh replaces the fluoride causing an enrichment in fluoride content the interactions of groundwater and rocks such as biotite muscovite and fluorite are explained in equations 6 9 6 kmg 3 alsi 3 o 10 f 2 2 oh kmg 3 alsi 3 o 10 oh 2 2 f co 2 biotite 7 kal 2 alsi 3 o 10 f 2

indices table 3 indicates fluoride enrichment in the groundwater the alkaline groundwater ph 7 8 8 5 environment with a high hco3 content was responsible for dissolution of f in groundwater subba rao 2006 adimalla and qian 2019 adimalla and li 2019 adimalla 2020 rao et al 1993 suggested that the alkalinity in terms of hco3 activates the processes of dissociation and dissolution of f from the soil and weathered rocks with a simultaneous precipitation of caco3 and a reduction of th in terms of ca 2 and mg 2 ions the hco3 had positive correlation with f r 0 44 and th had a negative relation with f r 0 30 when groundwater comes in contact with rocks containing albite minerals the groundwater becomes enriched in na as shown explained by the following equation 10 10 2 na alsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o 2 na 2 hco 3 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 mg 2 4 h 4 sio 4 albite the mineral albite may be the possible source of excess na over cl li et al 2014 further the clays were the sources of both na and cl ions todd 1980 hem 1991 the groundwater rich in na had a significant contribution in the controlling of groundwater f geochemistry the high f load could had been attributed to the high na and low ca 2 contents in groundwater ahada and suthar 2018 the evidence of this statement had been observed by a positive correlation between na and f r 0 14 the increase of hco3 decreased the f content in the groundwater of the present study area due to leaching of precipitated secondary salts chidambaram et al 2013 the negative correlation between fluoride and both calcium and magnesium 0 13 and 0 28 indicated the precipitation of caf2 and mgf2 due to abundance of calcium and magnesium li et al 2018 jack et al 2005 reported sepiolite and palygorskite as mg sinks in rajasthan responsible for release of f under alkaline conditions the negative correlation between f and no3 r 0 24 indicates geogenic sources responsible for fluoride levels in groundwater rather than anthropogenic activities in the study area the presence of high hco3 na and ph favours the release of fluoride from aquifer matrix into groundwater f anion sorbed onto positively charged surfaces and show greater desorption at higher ph it was observed that the groundwater in study area was alkaline so the solubility of fluoride bearing minerals had been increased in groundwater kumar et al 2017 4 5 groundwater fluctuation and fluoride the concentration of fluoride in groundwater tends to increase in the pre monsoon march to may period where the seasonal fluctuation in fluoride concentration follows the groundwater level fluctuation fig 8 the groundwater level shows a rise in post monsoon season because of rainfall recharge if we look at the yearly trend of groundwater in the district we see that there is continuous decrease in level and thus the problem of fluoride goes on increasing with time the continuous decline of water table in the region can be associated with increase in pumping 4 6 anthropogenic reasons for fluoride increase the region which registers high fluoride concentration is dominated by medium brown sandy soil and deep dark brown sandy soil fig 4 agriculture is main economic activity two crops kharif and rabi are generally grown in the district but more than three crops are grown in the region dominated with high level of fluoride kharif crop is mostly rain fed whereas the rabi and zaid crops are irrigated with groundwater since the fluoride content is higher in pre monsoon season irrigation can be associated with rise in fluoride content fig 4 since irrigation is available in the rabi seasons the fertilizers are also applied in these seasons only these fertilizers are also expected to contribute towards high fluoride concentration 4 7 water suitability for industrial purpose the industrial suitability of groundwater resources besides agriculture and domestic use jasrotia et al 2019 is very important task for today the evaluation must consider adverse effects in term of corrosion and incrustation properties of water raghunath 1982 karanth 1987 das et al 2016 therefore a detailed assessment of groundwater resources in dausa district was carried out and identified the incrustation and corrosive in nature generally parameters such as ph ec cl so4 2 and hco3 are responsible for corrosive and incrustation behaviour of groundwater anonymous 1983 the mechanism of corrosion is electrochemical in nature where the solution of iron forms ferrous ion in anodic areas and release electrons that flow to cathodic area in an iron chemical process the hydrogen ion is neutralized and causes atomic hydrogen to plate out on the metal surface clark and barnes 1969 the reduction of sulphide compounds is also a relevant aspect of groundwater incrustation and corrosion processes clarke and barnes 1964 when addressing iron the stepwise reduction of sulphate is given by mckinney 1962 11 the sulphate reducing organism catalyzes the combination of atomic hydrogen with sulphate and it removes the protective layer of hydrogen from the cathode and allows the corrosion clark and barnes 1969 in the study area the ec values were low 1500 μs cm in 52 94 samples and were high 1500 μs cm in 47 05 of groundwater samples table 4 high values of ec in groundwater samples were responsible for the corrosive nature and low value of ec in groundwater samples for non corrosive nature the chloride content in groundwater was mainly influenced by leaching of industrial effluent most of the groundwater samples 85 29 fallen in low chloride concentration 500 mg l and it was non corrosive nature only 14 70 of samples fallen in high chloride concentration 500 mg l and it was corrosive nature the incrustation was very hard cement like layer which was not harmful because it protects the corrosion the adverse effect that was created the deposition of heavy incrustation it leads to reduction of the water carrying capacity of pipes it was caused by precipitation of carbonates of calcium and magnesium or their sulphate and silicates agrawal 2012 in the study area the majority of samples 67 65 fallen in non incrusting type only few 32 35 of samples fallen in hard incrusting type the corrosive nature of water based on the relative abundance of a strong acid to weak acid was calculated by following equation ryznar 1944 raman 1985 12 corrosivity ratio cr 0 028 cl 0 021 so 4 2 0 02 hco 3 co 3 2 4 8 concentration are expressed in mg l the values of cr 1 0 are suitable for industrial processes due to non corrosive nature of water in the study area the majority 64 70 of samples were fallen in this category the value of cr 1 0 were not suitable for industrial processes due to corrosion of metal from water in the study area only small 35 30 of samples fallen in this category the remedial measures for problematic aquifer include boiling of water to reduce conduit incrustation or the use of fiber glass plastic pvc pipes and stainless pipe to mitigate the corrosion and incrustation 5 conclusions groundwater quality has been evaluated specially in terms of fluoride concentration and its sources in a semi arid area dausa district rajasthan it has been concluded that fluoride contamination in groundwater of the study area mainly depends on fluoride bearing minerals and their interaction with water the main sources of fluoride identified are decomposition dissociation and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals such as biotite and muscovite a seasonal variability in fluoride concentration can also observed which can be associated with rainfall recharge and pumping for irrigation the high alkalinity is also the factor of high contamination of fluoride the groundwater chemistry is mainly depending on the presence of cations and anions pearson s correlation coefficients and chloroalkaline indices are used to evaluate geochemistry of fluoride contaminated groundwater the order of major cations and anions are na mg 2 ca 2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 f respectively in the study area the presence of high hco3 na and ph favours the release of fluoride from aquifer matrix into groundwater the high ec is also mainly attributed to geochemical process like ion exchange reverse exchange evaporation silicate weathering and rock water interaction in the study area the tool corrosivity ratio cr is used for water suitability for the industrial purposes the corrosive nature and incrustation are mainly depending for the parameters such as ph ec cl so4 2 and hco3 the high na ca 2 and hco3 ca 2 ratios along with high tds also confirm the fluoride contamination in groundwater in the study area periodical monitoring is essential to assess the groundwater quality the constructing artificial recharge structures are essential to improve the fluoride concentration in groundwater in the study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12114,the hydrodynamic study was carried out using an approach that takes into account the hydrological balance the relationships between the hydrodynamic parameters q pt ns ea qs and t and the influence of these parameters on the drilling productivity the kadey department receives on average 1428 93 mm of rain per year and the amount of water likely to infiltrate to recharge the aquifers is 107 4 mm or 7 51 of rainfall the study of the physical and hydrodynamic parameters shows that the depths of the studied drillings vary from 45 to 90 m with an average of 69 m the thickness of the alterites is between 2 7 and 31 m with an average of 11 9 m the hydraulically active depths are between 60 and 80 m the transmissivity values obtained by the method of cooper jacob in descent are between 2 58 10 3 and 4 78 10 3 m2 s with an average of 1 35 10 3 m2 s drilling flows range between 0 2 and 10 m3 h with an average of 2 45 m3 h which gives us specific flow rates between 5 4 10 6 to 5 63 10 4 m3 s for an average of 5 19 10 4 m2 s transmissivities specific flows and exploitation rates have coefficients of variation greater than 100 thus reflecting the structural heterogeneity of the aquifer graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrodynamics aquifer recharge productivity transmissivity exploitation flow 1 introduction water is a vital part of life and is important for countless human activities it has been at the heart of all issues for decades with an annual investment of more than 600 billion who 2011 this water is divided into three categories saltwater 97 of the world s reserves fresh water 0 3 and fresh water not directly useable 2 4 mobilizing a total volume of about 1 34 1018 m3 ntep gwet and adeline 2005 undp wb 2017 as stated above there is enough water but in terms of availability resources are scarce as 99 7 of the waters are not accessible freshwater a directly accessible material presents a sad picture since in the general opinion its scarcity seems inevitable however a country that lacks water is a country that can neither feed its population nor develop moreover per capita water consumption is now considered an indicator of a country s economic development who 2011 undp wb 2017 mfonka et al 2018 the cameroonian authorities aware of these problems have multiplied the projects of establishment of water points for the supply of drinking water to rural populations as well as large cities with the support of development partners non governmental organizations civil society south cameroon s groundwater resources are largely contained in the reservoirs formed by the fractured basement due to its wide geographical distribution i e 97 5 of the south cameroon plateau ewodo mboudou 2011 these localized resources in fractured or fissured aquifers which are relatively well protected due to the high surface coverage are therefore bacteriologically and parasitologically sound in the present study where we started with an analysis of the different terms of a hydrological report it is a question of showing the importance of each one in the process of recharging superficial and deep aquifers djeuda tchapnga et al 2000 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 mfonka et al 2018 in short it is a matter of performing using a decomposition of the different formulas of coutagne a mathematical prediction mathematical simulation of the quantity of water that can be stored if the inflections and precipitations are known groundwater resources are the main sources of drinking water supply in rural areas as is the case in kadey these resources deserve to be known in order to promote an optimization of the water supply and a sustainable management of this resource the search for groundwater in the middle of the basement is essentially based on the identification of the fractures that are witnesses of the tectonic deformations thus drilling that does not cross any fracture cannot produce water this is why failures are generally numerous during drilling campaigns when the implantation is not carried out under optimal conditions kouadio et al 2008 tabue youmbi 2013 fantong et al 2016 in the east cameroon region an inventory of the various works carried out by the unesco 1987 has made it possible to count 1 176 water points boreholes and modern wells but the report is bitter because on these 1176 works 766 are abandoned for various reasons mechanical failure drying up water quality etc and 128 were declared negative because not having reached a minimum flow of 1 m3 h to be declared positive making a total of 538 abandoned works or 45 75 this high failure rate 54 25 attracts not only the attention of the authorities but also that of the scientific community this study is therefore a contribution to the evaluation of the water potential of aquifers and to propose a set of recommendations for sustainable management of this natural resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 geographic location the department of kadey is located in the region of east cameroon between 4 12 and 4 36 north latitude and 14 29 and 14 45 east longitude fig 1 it covers a total area of 2571 km2 and is bordered on the north by the lom and djérem department on the east by the central african republic on the south by the boomba and ngoko departments and on the west by the haut nyong department sigha nkamdjou 1994 mvondo ondoa 2009 vishiti et al 2015 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 tchakounté et al 2017 the kadey department belongs to the béaré oya gold district in which the mining activities artisanal and semi mechanized mining of gold quarrying by mechanical sinking and even by mining etc are very intense and lead to bedrock cracking permanently mvondo ondoa 2009 vishiti et al 2015 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 the climate is a transitional equatorial guinean type with four seasons two 02 rainy seasons and two 02 dry seasons as shown in fig 2 bangouls and gaussen 1969 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 2 1 2 hydrogeological context and data acquisition generally in the basement zone two types of aquifers can be distinguished the aquifer of alterites superficial and the fractured aquifers deeper cooper jacob 1950 koita 2010 soro et al 2010 ewodo et al 2013 femba 2005 according to edet and worden 2009 eiriksson et al 2013 kouassy et al 2016 the exploitation of aquifer alterites in sub saharan africa began in the years 1950 1960 the exploitation of these aquifers was mainly related to the lack of suitable means for drilling but also to the lack of knowledge or underestimation of the hydraulic role of fracking in the healthy basement these aquifers which develop in sandy clay formations are capable of accumulating large amounts of water but their low permeability makes extraction difficult djeuda tchapnga 1987 characterizes alterite aquifers as aquifers with high total interstice porosity low effective porosity and very low permeability in the granito gneissic domain as is the case in the department of kadey alterites are unequally rich in aquifer levels and these are generally not very productive according to femba 2005 eiriksson et al 2013 only a few shallow levels above healthy rock are of interest especially when they are in the aquifer beating zone level change piezometrical zone unlike alterites the basement has practically zero matrix porosity except in the superficial zone corresponding to the lower limit of the grained arenas the permeability is good especially in areas with a high fracturing density copper jacob 1947 soro et al 2010 eiriksson et al 2013 the hydrogeological data used for this study mainly concern the technical data of the drilling carried out in the department of kadey from 1990 to 2015 we have retained for this study 56 drill datasheets for the relevance of the data which they abound notably pumping tests the drilling datasheets used were provided by the regional center for scientific research and innovation crri of the east 2 2 methods 2 2 1 determination of groundwater recharge the assessment of groundwater recharge is one of the most relevant parameters in hydrogeology but also the most difficult to estimate various approaches have been considered and tested these are direct geochemical physical and climatic methods in this study we will primarily use the climate method or water balance method because of its ease of use and available data tabue youmbi 2013 fontang et al 2016 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 it is based on the principle that precipitation p falling in a given region is divided between evapotranspiration etr groundwater recharge i and surface flow r so that the equation hydrological balance is expressed by the relationship 1 p etr r i however since the rain is a known datum etr remains determined by the coutagne method the turc and thornthwaite methods do not make it possible to establish the hydrological balance in this type of region as djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 and r

interpretation of the pumping tests from the different drilling datasheets the interpretation of these essays is based on the transient hydrodynamic expressions of thies 1935 and copper jacob 1947 in general these methods are applicable for long term pumping but from short term tests provided that a plateau is reached during each cycle these parameters can be calculated lasm 2000 soro et al 2010 ewodo mboutou et al 2012 2 2 5 1 determination of transmissivity the transmissivity can be evaluated with the descent data as well as the pumped water flow in the first case the value of the transmissivity is tainted by error due to the uncertainties in the measurements caused by the drilling pressure losses which can reach 50 or more in some cases lachassagne and wyns 2005 fantong et al 2016 in the second case the value of the transmissivity obtained is much more reliable because the losses in the drilling are negligible transmissivity was evaluated using the method of cooper jacob 1946 using the data of the ascent to eliminate the effects of quadratic losses in drilling and around the borehole as suggested lasm 2000 femba 2005 and lasm et al 2015 this formula is based on the formula of theis which it is also an approximation simplified it is written 6 s 0 183 q t l o g 2 25 t t r 2 s if we report on paper semi logarithmic the drawdown s as a function of the time t rise we get a straight line as soon as the logarithmic approximation becomes possible this line is extended to the abscissa axis and the intersection point has coordinates s 0 t t 0 if we put these values in the previous equation we deduce s 2 25 t t r 2 if now t to 10 from which log t to 1 we can replace s by s that is to say by the difference of drawdown per logarithmic cycle of time which give 7 t 0 183 q δ s in theory to be able to use this approximation the following conditions must be met the tablecloth tested is captive the aquifer layer is homogeneous isotropic and of the same thickness throughout the zone of influence of the pumping the aquifer layer is of infinite lateral extension the release of water by the porous level is made as a result of an instantaneous level decrease the well is complete the radius of the well is negligible the pumping rate is constant and equivalent to the operating flow of the structure the test pumping carried out practically never verifies all of these conditions this situation does not prevent the use of this method for the interpretation of the tests here according to the work of shanshan et al 2015 all the studied tablecloths are taken as captive roof and impermeable wall so we suppose that they check the hypotheses of jacob s method it was not possible for us to evaluate the storage coefficients of the aquifers because of the absence of a piezometer thus to better assess the distribution of transmissivity a classification of transmissivity has been established and is as follows kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 onana et al 2017 weak class t 10 5 m2 s middle class 10 5 t 10 4 m2 s strong class t 10 4 m2 s 2 2 5 2 determination of the specific flow the specific flow is one of the hydraulic parameters whose measurement is easy on a structure it is the ratio of the pumping rate to the drawdown observed in the well the specific flow also gives indications on the characteristics of the boreholes and on the state of connection between the networks of fractures leblond 1984 soro et al 2010 hartter et al 2018 q s was calculated at the end of the third level at all drill holes from the following formula 8 q s q s with q s specific flow m3 h q pumping rate m3 h s drawdown m to better understand the distribution of specific flows in the aquifers of the department of kadey we proceeded to the classification of these flows and we obtained the following classes weak class q s 0 1 m3 h middle class 0 1 m3 h q s 1 m3 h strong class q s 1 2 2 5 3 study of the parameters influencing the drilling productivity for this purpose the first works focused on finding the most productive fractures in a relatively recent period other authors have shown that the productivity of the structures in the middle of the basement can also be linked to other parameters such as the thickness of the alteration and the depth of the boreholes in cameroon in particular the studies have shown some relationships between the alteration thickness the depth of the boreholes and the exploitation rate of these boreholes this flow rate refers to the capacity of an aquifer to provide through a catchment a minimum flow that can be exploited it also refers to the productivity of an aquifer in order to know the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on drilling productivity in the kadey department two types of analysis were carried out it was on the one hand to highlight the roles that individually play the parameters such as q s specific flow a e thickness of alterite p t total depth t transmissivity and n s level static on productivity and on the other hand to make an approach based on establishing correlation between all these variables from a multidimensional statistical analysis such as principal component analysis femba 2005 minee gwp cmr 2009 prasad 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 assessment of aquifer productivity 3 1 1 results of the hydroclimatological study 3 1 1 1 application of the double cumul test in order to verify the correction made to the batouri station series the double cumulating law has been applied which shows the homogeneity of the said series with reference to bertoua abong mbang and meiganga which are well known fig 3 the application of this method to the batouri station shows no break the points are aligned along a line whose correlation coefficient is 0 999 which gives the series a good homogeneity the analysis of the double cummul curve allows us to observe that there is homogeneity of precipitation data in the bertoua and batouri stations this state of affairs is undoubtedly due to the presence of said stations in the same synoptic scale these results are therefore in line with those of bon et al 2016 for the sub watersheds of sanaga and confirm the notion of uniformity in precipitation of the south cameroon plateau formerly mentioned by bouziane and labadi 2009 and insistently resumed by eiriksson et al 2013 and tabue youmbi 2013 3 1 1 2 rainfall variation at the batouri station statistical calculations give the characteristics of the batouri series which are presented in table 1 statistical calculations show that the average annual precipitation is 1430 19 mm 3 1 2 results of the water balance the results of the hydrological balance study for the period 1975 2016 are recorded in the following table table 2 the kadey department receives an average of 1430 19 mm of rain a year the estimated runoff is 159 03 mm or 15 67 of the precipitation the value of the actual evapotranspiration estimated by the coutagne method gives a value of 792 25 mm representing 76 90 of the precipitation the infiltration obtained is only 86 42 mm it represents 7 41 of the precipitation we can say that the feeding of the water table of the department is done largely with the help of the effective infiltration 3 1 3 hydrodynamic characterization of aquifers 3 1 3 1 statistical analysis of drilling parameters statistical analysis of drilling parameters yielded several results table 3 the flow rates vary respectively between 0 2 and 10 m3 h with an average of 2 454 m3 h for q and between 5 4 10 6 and 5 63 10 4 m3 h with an average of 5 413 10 5 m3 h for q s calculated coefficients of variation are greater than 1 indicating heterogeneity in the data in our study only 10 boreholes have a flow rate q greater than 2 m3 h this represents a success rate of 43 47 the transmissivity values are between 1 92 10 6 and 5 8 10 4 m2 s with an average of 4 89 10 5 and a coefficient of variation of 2 494 these values are heterogeneous and very weak in fact only 44 of the boreholes have transmissivities ranging from medium to high the localities of dem kenzou and mbang hold the highest values with respectively 1 16 10 4 m2 s 1 6 10 4 m2 s and 5 8 10 4 m2 s the specific flow used to show drilling productivity varies from 5 4 10 6 to 5 63 10 4 m3 s the total drilling depth varies from 45 to 90 m with an average of 69 73 m this depth is subject to obtaining a flow rate called positive flow and fixed at the start of the project the alteration thickness varies from 2 7 31 m with an average of 11 358 m the static level meanwhile varies from 3 41 to 24 80 m with an average of 11 56 m the different coefficients of variation determined for the depth of alteration the thickness of alteration and the static level are less than 100 these low values reflect a low dispersion of the parameters studied they also show that there is some homogeneity in these values 3 1 3 2 analysis of the parameters influencing productivity this analysis is based essentially on the results obtained by the work done with the principal components analysis pca the analysis of the correlation matrix table 4 shows a high correlation between q and qs 0 799 between t and q 0 664 and a significant correlation between p t and n s 0 527 and t and q s 0 503 no other significant correlation appears in this matrix the analysis of eigenvalues table 5 shows that factors f1 f2 and f3 alone account for 83 749 of the variables expressed they can therefore be used to interpret the results obtained at the factorial plane f1 f2 the factor f1 is determined by t qs and q the proximity of these variables in the community circle indicates the strong correlation that exists between them this factor expresses the productivity of the department s works these results confirm that there is a relationship between the transmissivity and the specific flow and between the transmissivity and the flow of the boreholes as for the factor f2 it is determined by p t e a and n s this axis shows us the accessibility of water in the aquifers of the department in fact the slight deterioration observed in the department indicates that aquifer levels are very often subject to seasonal fluctuations baka et al 2011 anaba onana et al 2017 mfonka et al 2018 the factorial plane f1 f3 represents 53 43 of the variables expressed the factor f1 is always determined by q s q and t and denotes the productivity of aquifers the f3 factor is defined by the total depth this axis can represent the availability of water resources in the department s aquifers the presence of ns on the f1 axis shows the influence of the pumping on the static level this level could be significantly reduced during different operations indeed when the static level in the aquifer rises the operating flow decreases and when the flow decreases increases but this is only valid for high and medium flows cooper jacob 1950 baka et al 2011 ewodo mboutou et al 2012 3 2 assessment of aquifer productivity the study of the hydrological balance reveals that for 1430 19 mm of rain fell every year on the department of kadey the part which amounts to the infiltration is estimated at 86 42 mm or 7 41 of the precipitations the aquifers of the department mobilize for a total area of 1770 km2 about 135 263 400 m3 of water the absence of a significant relationship between the parameters p t e a n s and t at the different graphs considered individually led to the adoption of a statistical study based on the principal component analysis pca the analysis of the results of the correlation matrix shows a good correlation between q and q s 0 799 thus to a lesser degree the existing relations between t and q 0 664 pt and n s 0 527 and t and q s 0 503 must be emphasized this weak correlation observed between t and qs shows the role played by the alterites in the permeability of the formations of the department indeed it is proved by several studies carried out on the basement that when the depth of alteration is important the probability of obtaining a high flow rate is very high kouassi et al 2012 lachassange et al 2015 mfonka et al 2018 this is not the case for aquifers in the department of kadey where the alteration thickness is very low in this context obtaining a large flow is related to the state of fracturing or cracking of the aquifer alassane 2004 ntep gwet and adeline 2005 minee gwp cmr 2009 soro et al 2010 tehna et al 2015 the results of the main components analysis pca made it possible to highlight the relationships between the different parameters the first three factors alone account for 83 749 of the variables expressed in the data at the factorial plane f1 f2 two hydrodynamic factor groupings are observed on the community circle it is on the one hand of t q and q s on the axis f1 and pt ns and ea on the axis f2 the factor f1 expresses the productivity of the works and reveals the existence of a relation between t q and q s this correlation shows the ease with which cuirasses alterites let themselves through the water this result could explain in part the high rate of negative drilling and the low flows very often observed in these lands this failure rate can also be due to the state of fracturing which remains an essential element in the transmissive capacity of crystalline and crystallophyllian rocks because in the absence of tectonic and disintegration phenomena these rocks are practically impermeable djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 lasm 2000 dibi et al 2004 lachassange et al 2005 n go et al 2005 soro et al 2010 prasad 2011 tehna et al 2015 the fractures generated condition good or poor transmissivity depending on whether they are open or closed minee gwp cmr 2009 n go et al 2005 lachassange et al 2011 adadzi et al 2018 the factor f2 expresses the accessibility of water in the aquifers of the department it essentially shows the variation of the level of water in these aquifers dibi et al 2004 point out that on granitic soils the water level in aquifers is often subject to seasonal fluctuations because of the weakness of the alteration thickness found in these formations this may explain the fact that productivity is less important in granitic terrain at the factorial plane f1 f3 the factor f3 can represent the availability of the water resource but this resource is threatened not only by the climatic conditions of the environment but also by the pumping which can cause a significant drawdown of the level of the groundwater 4 conclusion this study which focused on the quantitative assessment of water resources in the kadey department concluded that the study of the water balance revealed that the etr calculated by the coutagne method is of the order of 1428 93 mm mobilizing about 77 of the precipitation and that the infiltration 104 40 mm represents only 7 51 of these runoff only receives 15 49 of this precipitation the hydrodynamic study of aquifers has shown that the formations of the department are weakly transmissive the hydraulically active depths are between 50 and 80 m about 65 of the boreholes have a low specific flow ie low productivity this low productivity is certainly due to the fact that in the basement area during village water campaigns the decision to stop drilling is not rationalized because some drilling is prematurely stopped as soon as the expected flow is obtained the pca data interpretation shows that the good productivity observed is mainly related to the total depth of the structures the alteration thickness and the level of the water in the borehole the study of the hydrological balance coupled with the hydrodynamic study in the department show that the aquifers of the department mobilize 135 582 000 m3 of water this volume of water can meet the needs of the population of the department if each inhabitant consumes on average 20 l of water per day but there is an uneven distribution of this resource in the department because at the moment when some localities benefit from water permanently others assist powerless drying up or intermittent drilling indeed the slight deterioration observed on the formations of the department seems to be the main cause of this intermittency because the water levels in aquifers are subject to seasonal fluctuations this greatly reduces the productivity of

12114,the hydrodynamic study was carried out using an approach that takes into account the hydrological balance the relationships between the hydrodynamic parameters q pt ns ea qs and t and the influence of these parameters on the drilling productivity the kadey department receives on average 1428 93 mm of rain per year and the amount of water likely to infiltrate to recharge the aquifers is 107 4 mm or 7 51 of rainfall the study of the physical and hydrodynamic parameters shows that the depths of the studied drillings vary from 45 to 90 m with an average of 69 m the thickness of the alterites is between 2 7 and 31 m with an average of 11 9 m the hydraulically active depths are between 60 and 80 m the transmissivity values obtained by the method of cooper jacob in descent are between 2 58 10 3 and 4 78 10 3 m2 s with an average of 1 35 10 3 m2 s drilling flows range between 0 2 and 10 m3 h with an average of 2 45 m3 h which gives us specific flow rates between 5 4 10 6 to 5 63 10 4 m3 s for an average of 5 19 10 4 m2 s transmissivities specific flows and exploitation rates have coefficients of variation greater than 100 thus reflecting the structural heterogeneity of

human activities it has been at the heart of all issues for decades with an annual investment of more than 600 billion who 2011 this water is divided into three categories saltwater 97 of the world s reserves fresh water 0 3 and fresh water not directly useable 2 4 mobilizing a total volume of about 1 34 1018 m3 ntep gwet and adeline 2005 undp wb 2017 as stated above there is enough water but in terms of availability resources are scarce as 99 7 of the waters are not accessible freshwater a directly accessible material presents a sad picture since in the general opinion its scarcity seems inevitable however a country that lacks water is a country that can neither feed its population nor develop moreover per capita water consumption is now considered an indicator of a country s economic development who 2011 undp wb 2017 mfonka et al 2018 the cameroonian authorities aware of these problems have multiplied the projects of establishment of water points for the supply of drinking water to rural populations as well as large cities with the support of development partners non governmental organizations civil society south cameroon s groundwater resources are largely contained in the reservoirs formed by the fractured basement due to its wide geographical distribution i e 97 5 of the south cameroon plateau ewodo mboudou 2011 these localized resources in fractured or fissured aquifers which are relatively well protected due to the high surface coverage are therefore bacteriologically and parasitologically sound in the present study where we started with an analysis of the different terms of a hydrological report it is a question of showing the importance of each one in the process of recharging superficial and deep aquifers djeuda tchapnga et al 2000 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 mfonka et al 2018 in short it is a matter of performing using a decomposition of the different formulas of coutagne a mathematical prediction mathematical simulation of the quantity of water that can be stored if the inflections and precipitations are known groundwater resources are the main sources of drinking water supply in rural areas as is the case in kadey these resources deserve to be known in order to promote an optimization of the water supply and a sustainable management of this resource the search for groundwater in the middle of the basement is essentially based on the identification of the fractures that are witnesses of the tectonic deformations thus drilling that does not cross any fracture cannot produce water this is why failures are generally numerous during drilling campaigns when the implantation is not carried out under optimal conditions kouadio et al 2008 tabue youmbi 2013 fantong et al 2016 in the east cameroon region an inventory of the various works carried out by the unesco 1987 has made it possible to count 1 176 water points boreholes and modern wells but the report is bitter because on these 1176 works 766 are abandoned for various reasons mechanical failure drying up water quality etc and 128 were declared negative because not having reached a minimum flow of 1 m3 h to be declared positive making a total of 538 abandoned works or 45 75 this high failure rate 54 25 attracts not only the attention of the authorities but also that of the scientific community this study is therefore a contribution to the evaluation of the water potential of aquifers and to propose a set of recommendations for sustainable management of this natural resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 geographic location the department of kadey is located in the region of east cameroon between 4 12 and 4 36 north latitude and 14 29 and 14 45 east longitude fig 1 it covers a total area of 2571 km2 and is bordered on the north by the lom and djérem department on the east by the central african republic on the south by the boomba and ngoko departments and on the west by the haut nyong department sigha nkamdjou 1994 mvondo ondoa 2009 vishiti et al 2015 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 tchakounté et al 2017 the kadey department belongs to the béaré oya gold district in which the mining activities artisanal and semi mechanized mining of gold quarrying by mechanical sinking and even by mining etc are very intense and lead to bedrock cracking permanently mvondo ondoa 2009 vishiti et al 2015 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 the climate is a transitional equatorial guinean type with four seasons two 02 rainy seasons and two 02 dry seasons as shown in fig 2 bangouls and gaussen 1969 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 2 1 2 hydrogeological context and data acquisition generally in the basement zone two types of aquifers can be distinguished the aquifer of alterites superficial and the fractured aquifers deeper cooper jacob 1950 koita 2010 soro et al 2010 ewodo et al 2013 femba 2005 according to edet and worden 2009 eiriksson et al 2013 kouassy et al 2016 the exploitation of aquifer alterites in sub saharan africa began in the years 1950 1960 the exploitation of these aquifers was mainly related to the lack of suitable means for drilling but also to the lack of knowledge or underestimation of the hydraulic role of fracking in the healthy basement these aquifers which develop in sandy clay formations are capable of accumulating large amounts of water but their low permeability makes extraction difficult djeuda tchapnga 1987 characterizes alterite aquifers as aquifers with high total interstice porosity low effective porosity and very low permeability in the granito gneissic domain as is the case in the department of kadey alterites are unequally rich in aquifer levels and these are generally not very productive according to femba 2005 eiriksson et al 2013 only a few shallow levels above healthy rock are of interest especially when they are in the aquifer beating zone level change piezometrical zone unlike alterites the basement has practically zero matrix porosity except in the superficial zone corresponding to the lower limit of the grained arenas the permeability is good especially in areas with a high fracturing density copper jacob 1947 soro et al 2010 eiriksson et al 2013 the hydrogeological data used for this study mainly concern the technical data of the drilling carried out in the department of kadey from 1990 to 2015 we have retained for this study 56 drill datasheets for the relevance of the data which they abound notably pumping tests the drilling datasheets used were provided by the regional center for scientific research and innovation crri of the east 2 2 methods 2 2 1 determination of groundwater recharge the assessment of groundwater recharge is one of the most relevant parameters in hydrogeology but also the most difficult to estimate various approaches have been considered and tested these are direct geochemical physical and climatic methods in this study we will primarily use the climate method or water balance method because of its ease of use and available data tabue youmbi 2013 fontang et al 2016 kouassy kalédjé et al 2016 it is based on the principle that precipitation p falling in a given region is divided between evapotranspiration etr groundwater recharge i and surface flow r so that the equation hydrological balance is expressed by the relationship 1 p etr r i however since the rain is a known datum etr remains determined by the coutagne method the turc and thornthwaite methods do not make it possible to establish the hydrological balance in this type of region as djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 and r

be linked to other parameters such as the thickness of the alteration and the depth of the boreholes in cameroon in particular the studies have shown some relationships between the alteration thickness the depth of the boreholes and the exploitation rate of these boreholes this flow rate refers to the capacity of an aquifer to provide through a catchment a minimum flow that can be exploited it also refers to the productivity of an aquifer in order to know the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on drilling productivity in the kadey department two types of analysis were carried out it was on the one hand to highlight the roles that individually play the parameters such as q s specific flow a e thickness of alterite p t total depth t transmissivity and n s level static on productivity and on the other hand to make an approach based on establishing correlation between all these variables from a multidimensional statistical analysis such as principal component analysis femba 2005 minee gwp cmr 2009 prasad 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 assessment of aquifer productivity 3 1 1 results of the hydroclimatological study 3 1 1 1 application of the double cumul test in order to verify the correction made to the batouri station series the double cumulating law has been applied which shows the homogeneity of the said series with reference to bertoua abong mbang and meiganga which are well known fig 3 the application of this method to the batouri station shows no break the points are aligned along a line whose correlation coefficient is 0 999 which gives the series a good homogeneity the analysis of the double cummul curve allows us to observe that there is homogeneity of precipitation data in the bertoua and batouri stations this state of affairs is undoubtedly due to the presence of said stations in the same synoptic scale these results are therefore in line with those of bon et al 2016 for the sub watersheds of sanaga and confirm the notion of uniformity in precipitation of the south cameroon plateau formerly mentioned by bouziane and labadi 2009 and insistently resumed by eiriksson et al 2013 and tabue youmbi 2013 3 1 1 2 rainfall variation at the batouri station statistical calculations give the characteristics of the batouri series which are presented in table 1 statistical calculations show that the average annual precipitation is 1430 19 mm 3 1 2 results of the water balance the results of the hydrological balance study for the period 1975 2016 are recorded in the following table table 2 the kadey department receives an average of 1430 19 mm of rain a year the estimated runoff is 159 03 mm or 15 67 of the precipitation the value of the actual evapotranspiration estimated by the coutagne method gives a value of 792 25 mm representing 76 90 of the precipitation the infiltration obtained is only 86 42 mm it represents 7 41 of the precipitation we can say that the feeding of the water table of the department is done largely with the help of the effective infiltration 3 1 3 hydrodynamic characterization of aquifers 3 1 3 1 statistical analysis of drilling parameters statistical analysis of drilling parameters yielded several results table 3 the flow rates vary respectively between 0 2 and 10 m3 h with an average of 2 454 m3 h for q and between 5 4 10 6 and 5 63 10 4 m3 h with an average of 5 413 10 5 m3 h for q s calculated coefficients of variation are greater than 1 indicating heterogeneity in the data in our study only 10 boreholes have a flow rate q greater than 2 m3 h this represents a success rate of 43 47 the transmissivity values are between 1 92 10 6 and 5 8 10 4 m2 s with an average of 4 89 10 5 and a coefficient of variation of 2 494 these values are heterogeneous and very weak in fact only 44 of the boreholes have transmissivities ranging from medium to high the localities of dem kenzou and mbang hold the highest values with respectively 1 16 10 4 m2 s 1 6 10 4 m2 s and 5 8 10 4 m2 s the specific flow used to show drilling productivity varies from 5 4 10 6 to 5 63 10 4 m3 s the total drilling depth varies from 45 to 90 m with an average of 69 73 m this depth is subject to obtaining a flow rate called positive flow and fixed at the start of the project the alteration thickness varies from 2 7 31 m with an average of 11 358 m the static level meanwhile varies from 3 41 to 24 80 m with an average of 11 56 m the different coefficients of variation determined for the depth of alteration the thickness of alteration and the static level are less than 100 these low values reflect a low dispersion of the parameters studied they also show that there is some homogeneity in these values 3 1 3 2 analysis of the parameters influencing productivity this analysis is based essentially on the results obtained by the work done with the principal components analysis pca the analysis of the correlation matrix table 4 shows a high correlation between q and qs 0 799 between t and q 0 664 and a significant correlation between p t and n s 0 527 and t and q s 0 503 no other significant correlation appears in this matrix the analysis of eigenvalues table 5 shows that factors f1 f2 and f3 alone account for 83 749 of the variables expressed they can therefore be used to interpret the results obtained at the factorial plane f1 f2 the factor f1 is determined by t qs and q the proximity of these variables in the community circle indicates the strong correlation that exists between them this factor expresses the productivity of the department s works these results confirm that there is a relationship between the transmissivity and the specific flow and between the transmissivity and the flow of the boreholes as for the factor f2 it is determined by p t e a and n s this axis shows us the accessibility of water in the aquifers of the department in fact the slight deterioration observed in the department indicates that aquifer levels are very often subject to seasonal fluctuations baka et al 2011 anaba onana et al 2017 mfonka et al 2018 the factorial plane f1 f3 represents 53 43 of the variables expressed the factor f1 is always determined by q s q and t and denotes the productivity of aquifers the f3 factor is defined by the total depth this axis can represent the availability of water resources in the department s aquifers the presence of ns on the f1 axis shows the influence of the pumping on the static level this level could be significantly reduced during different operations indeed when the static level in the aquifer rises the operating flow decreases and when the flow decreases increases but this is only valid for high and medium flows cooper jacob 1950 baka et al 2011 ewodo mboutou et al 2012 3 2 assessment of aquifer productivity the study of the hydrological balance reveals that for 1430 19 mm of rain fell every year on the department of kadey the part which amounts to the infiltration is estimated at 86 42 mm or 7 41 of the precipitations the aquifers of the department mobilize for a total area of 1770 km2 about 135 263 400 m3 of water the absence of a significant relationship between the parameters p t e a n s and t at the different graphs considered individually led to the adoption of a statistical study based on the principal component analysis pca the analysis of the results of the correlation matrix shows a good correlation between q and q s 0 799 thus to a lesser degree the existing relations between t and q 0 664 pt and n s 0 527 and t and q s 0 503 must be emphasized this weak correlation observed between t and qs shows the role played by the alterites in the permeability of the formations of the department indeed it is proved by several studies carried out on the basement that when the depth of alteration is important the probability of obtaining a high flow rate is very high kouassi et al 2012 lachassange et al 2015 mfonka et al 2018 this is not the case for aquifers in the department of kadey where the alteration thickness is very low in this context obtaining a large flow is related to the state of fracturing or cracking of the aquifer alassane 2004 ntep gwet and adeline 2005 minee gwp cmr 2009 soro et al 2010 tehna et al 2015 the results of the main components analysis pca made it possible to highlight the relationships between the different parameters the first three factors alone account for 83 749 of the variables expressed in the data at the factorial plane f1 f2 two hydrodynamic factor groupings are observed on the community circle it is on the one hand of t q and q s on the axis f1 and pt ns and ea on the axis f2 the factor f1 expresses the productivity of the works and reveals the existence of a relation between t q and q s this correlation shows the ease with which cuirasses alterites let themselves through the water this result could explain in part the high rate of negative drilling and the low flows very often observed in these lands this failure rate can also be due to the state of fracturing which remains an essential element in the transmissive capacity of crystalline and crystallophyllian rocks because in the absence of tectonic and disintegration phenomena these rocks are practically impermeable djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 lasm 2000 dibi et al 2004 lachassange et al 2005 n go et al 2005 soro et al 2010 prasad 2011 tehna et al 2015 the fractures generated condition good or poor transmissivity depending on whether they are open or closed minee gwp cmr 2009 n go et al 2005 lachassange et al 2011 adadzi et al 2018 the factor f2 expresses the accessibility of water in the aquifers of the department it essentially shows the variation of the level of water in these aquifers dibi et al 2004 point out that on granitic soils the water level in aquifers is often subject to seasonal fluctuations because of the weakness of the alteration thickness found in these formations this may explain the fact that productivity is less important in granitic terrain at the factorial plane f1 f3 the factor f3 can represent the availability of the water resource but this resource is threatened not only by the climatic conditions of the environment but also by the pumping which can cause a significant drawdown of the level of the groundwater 4 conclusion this study which focused on the quantitative assessment of water resources in the kadey department concluded that the study of the water balance revealed that the etr calculated by the coutagne method is of the order of 1428 93 mm mobilizing about 77 of the precipitation and that the infiltration 104 40 mm represents only 7 51 of these runoff only receives 15 49 of this precipitation the hydrodynamic study of aquifers has shown that the formations of the department are weakly transmissive the hydraulically active depths are between 50 and 80 m about 65 of the boreholes have a low specific flow ie low productivity this low productivity is certainly due to the fact that in the basement area during village water campaigns the decision to stop drilling is not rationalized because some drilling is prematurely stopped as soon as the expected flow is obtained the pca data interpretation shows that the good productivity observed is mainly related to the total depth of the structures the alteration thickness and the level of the water in the borehole the study of the hydrological balance coupled with the hydrodynamic study in the department show that the aquifers of the department mobilize 135 582 000 m3 of water this volume of water can meet the needs of the population of the department if each inhabitant consumes on average 20 l of water per day but there is an uneven distribution of this resource in the department because at the moment when some localities benefit from water permanently others assist powerless drying up or intermittent drilling indeed the slight deterioration observed on the formations of the department seems to be the main cause of this intermittency because the water levels in aquifers are subject to seasonal fluctuations this greatly reduces the productivity of
