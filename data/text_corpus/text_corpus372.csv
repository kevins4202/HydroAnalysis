1860,worldwide highly populated countries are experiencing an imbalance between the supply and demand of water india is one such example which has only 4 of the world s water resources and a population of more than 1 3 billion its water demand is expected to rise by more than 75 in the upcoming decades due to fast population growth and expansion of irrigated agriculture industrialisation and urbanisation the consequences of this increased demand are already visible such as water quality deterioration near urban centres water table lowering in the north western region and seawater intrusion in coastal areas due to aquifer over exploitation the occurrence of erratic and unreliable rainfall in the past few years has further aggravated the situation in such a scenario information on groundwater surface water gw sw interaction processes is helpful for the conservation and management of water resources therefore this study thoroughly reviews the interaction phenomenon occurring in indian waters it covers the interaction in natural and artificially constructed environments methods for exchange flux quantification conceptual applications and challenges in accomplishing these investigations rivers streams canals or seawater were considered as sw components in the majority of the studies with the main focus on the ganga river basin in the case of river aquifer systems however most of the investigations were site specific without providing a generalised perspective and in many cases the interaction was not considered in totality also certain critical sites have not received the attention of the scientific and research community these are dam reservoirs and wetlands in the himalayas eco sensitive areas in north eastern india submarine gw discharge sites at islands and desertic and karstic terrains on a regional scale very few research articles are available for india s western and central regions accordingly all such regions need to be explored in the upcoming studies in the context of flux quantification methodology modern techniques like geophysical methods and fully coupled numerical models were used fewer times than conventional techniques such as isotopic hydrochemical and hydrological analyses therefore extensive data collection and modern methods are recommended to study complex systems and obtain more accurate information further the government sector seems reluctant to recognise this concept since in various reports complete information is unavailable for the interaction mechanism and only some aspects of the phenomenon have been considered additionally there are anomalies in the gw recharge estimation from non rainfall sources hence we suggest an institutional framework that allows the stakeholders to undertake detailed investigations for any interaction setup and frame an appropriate strategy for handling the country s water issues keywords groundwater surface water interaction water resources management conjunctive use groundwater over exploitation water quality institutional framework data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater gw and surface water sw resources are key components of the natural hydrological cycle that help sustain life on earth over the past few decades they have been undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic activities and natural processes garc√≠a ruiz et al 2011 thereby limiting freshwater availability for human consumption conventional studies have separately focused on the quantity and quality of gw and sw for resolving such problems winter et al 1998 however with the enhancement of scientific knowledge and improvement in measurement and modelling techniques scientists have supported the idea of investigating the connection between gw and sw to facilitate their effective conservation and management kalbus et al 2006 therefore the concept of gw sw interaction has become very popular in recent years gw interacts with the sw primarily by three mechanisms roy et al 2015 winter et al 1998 a sw recharges gw banks et al 2011 e g losing stream b gw discharges into sw li et al 2019 li et al 2017 e g gaining stream and c gw recharge and discharge may co occur at different locations of sw cartwright et al 2014 the degree of interaction depends on several factors these include regional topography cey et al 1998 roy et al 2015 wang et al 2016 underlying geology wang et al 2016 sub surface hydraulic properties kumar et al 2009 martinez et al 2015 westbrook et al 2005 temporal variation in precipitation cey et al 1998 kumar et al 2009 roy et al 2015 seasonal changes in sw and gw level das et al 2021a martinez et al 2015 roy et al 2015 continuous pumping of water roy et al 2015 the difference in opinion of hydrologists and hydrogeologists concerning the selection of methods models for investigating gw sw interaction saxena and singh 2021 and other fluvial anthropogenic and geological processes das et al 2021a martinez et al 2015 subsequently gw sw interaction plays a central role in the management of water resources ranging from water allocation during low flows sahoo and sahoo 2019 yang et al 2014 pollutant filtration grischek and ray 2009 naganna et al 2017 nutrient regulation sahoo and sahoo 2019 aquifer replenishment alam and umar 2013 jha et al 2009 naganna et

environmental flow maintenance hendriks et al 2014 sahoo and sahoo 2019 to the regulation of oceanic strontium sr budgets beck et al 2013 danish et al 2020 for instance river bank filtration rbf and managed aquifer recharge mar techniques based on gw sw interaction can improve the quality and availability of gw ghosh et al 2015a rao et al 2020 sharma et al 2014 similarly coupled gw sw models have helped assess river stream environmental flows joseph et al 2021 a detailed investigation of gw sw interaction is therefore crucial in the context of a vast country like india that is facing a rapid decline in per capita availability of water mohanty et al 2012 rao et al 2020 table 1 india is the seventh largest nation globally the great himalayas borders its northern part while its southern peninsular region meets the bay of bengal on the east the arabian sea on the west and the indian ocean on the south the mainland is situated entirely in the northern hemisphere extending between latitudes 8 4 and 37 6 north and longitudes 68 7 and 97 25 east and it has four main physical features including mountains plains desert region and southern peninsula national portal of india 2020 on either side of the peninsula a group of islands also belong to india in totality the country s water resource potential has been estimated as approximately 1999 billion cubic meters bcm which is significant for the national economy cwc 2021 according to the estimate of the standing sub committee of m o jal shakti d o mowr 2000 given in table 2 the total water demand will increase by 78 in 40 years for various sectors with irrigation having a majority stake 74 in it similarly from the nciwrd 1999 estimate the minimum and maximum total water demand will increase by 40 and 66 in 40 years table 2 however fulfilling these growing freshwater requirements is challenging for numerous reasons india has a whopping population of more than 1 3 billion about 17 1 of the world s population with just 4 of the world s water resources total annual utilisable water resources 690 bcm sw 433 bcm gw 1123 bcm indicating the inequality between the demand and supply of water adri 2017 this inequality will become more significant in the future india will remain under water stressed conditions for the coming decades since the population is expected to rise to 1 628 billion along with the decline in per capita water availability to 1228 m3 year by 2051 table 1 the increasing population will create an annual food requirement of more than 250 million tons and total grain demand of 375 million tons by 2050 thus generating additional demand for water cwc 2019 other contributing factors to water inequality include climate change impacts increased water demand for industry and energy production slow pace of water infrastructure development and insufficient investment inefficient use of water accelerated urbanization and the expansion of municipal water supply sanitation systems cwc 2019 there is an uneven spatial distribution of water for the living population many big cities such as mumbai jaipur bhatinda lucknow nagpur and chennai are experiencing acute water shortages compelling their administrations to opt for water rationing during the summer months ghosh 2021 some of these urban centres still lack a sustainable conservation strategy and alternate water sources appropriate quality drinking water is scarce in rural areas especially drought prone regions udmale et al 2016 recently a national assessment of dynamic gw resources revealed that irrigation use constitutes 89 217 61 bcm of the total annual gw extraction 244 92 bcm while domestic and industrial use make up its remaining 11 share 27 3 bcm cgwb 2021a consequently gw is depleting more than its recharge due to its overexploitation in many states adri 2017 especially in north western india cgwb 2021a pumping wells with a free power supply provided by the government have resulted in rapid depletion due to excessive gw abstraction heavy seawater intrusion is witnessed in coastal areas rendering the agricultural lands unsuitable for cultivation hence the knowledge of gw sw interaction can solve the problems mentioned above suppose either of these water sources faces any quantity or quality related issues in that case the other source can be used to improve the condition of the degrading source provided they are connected in that region conversely suppose one source is responsible for the quality deterioration or reduction in the volume of water in the linked source in that case suitable arrangements can be made to minimise the exchange between them and protect the degrading source many interaction studies are available for different locations in india they have covered a variety of natural settings and anthropogenically modified sites using both conventional and modern methodologies especially after 2009 the number of publications has increased significantly from around 3 year to more than 9 year fig 1 indicating that this issue has become a trending research topic in the past few years however the available literature is disorganised since many of these works are confined to local scale or site specific investigations without providing any broader outlook for framing a national water management policy the occurrence of gw sw interaction in different environments and the applicability of multiple methods for its extent determination have made it difficult to generalise the information and derive meaningful conclusions for example instead of using groundwater surface water interaction explicitly many authors have used the terms like stream aquifer interaction lake groundwater interaction submarine groundwater discharge seawater intrusion etc which creates problems while searching for relevant information related to the interaction phenomenon moreover some significant critical zones from the national and environmental perspectives have been unreported in past research therefore this study presents a comprehensive and systematic review of different research works carried out in india from 1991 to mid of 2021 on the subject of gw sw interaction its main objective is to inform various stakeholders policymakers and scientists about the current information related to the connectivity of sw and gw challenges encountered during such investigations and possible areas for future research initially this article illustrates gw sw interaction studies in different natural systems followed by anthropogenically modified systems then it describes various approaches adopted for characterising the interaction and the conceptual applications finally a relevant discussion and useful recommendations have been provided for deep insight into this topic 2 gw sw interaction in different natural systems natural sw features like streams rivers lakes ponds wetlands seas and oceans often interact with gw toran 2019 winter et al 1998 as per the latest government records the recharge from monsoon as well as non monsoon rainfall constitutes around 64 280 06 bcm of india s total annual gw recharge while recharge from other sources is about 36 156 08 bcm cgwb 2021a here recharge from other sources means canal seepage irrigation return flow and recharge from tanks ponds water conservation structures water bodies etc cwc 2021 since due to climate change the estimate of gw recharge from rainfall is somewhat unreliable therefore assessing the connection between gw and sw becomes significant and cannot be ignored in fact out of this 156 08 bcm of non rainfall recharge 52 9 takes place during the non monsoon season implying that gw sw interaction is more important for maintaining gw resources when monsoon season is not prevalent in the country the state wise variation of annual non rainfall gw recharge further supports the above statements fig 2 except for the north eastern states excluding tripura and nagaland and island union territories uts rest of india has a substantial component of non rainfall gw recharge particularly states and uts of north and north western india namely delhi haryana punjab chandigarh jammu and kashmir and ladakh have at least 60 of their annual gw recharge coming from such sources these areas are a part of the indus and the ganga basins which have an extensive river network furthermore in rajasthan delhi haryana and punjab the stage of gw extraction is more than 100 cgwb 2021a a significant proportion of the aquifer recharge from non rainfall sources in these states implies that the gw sw interaction concept can help deal with the depleting water table issues a major limitation of the above data is that it does not specify the environment in which interaction is occurring natural systems or anthropogenically affected sites the type of mechanism and its spatiotemporal variability the type of sw body e g river lake tank reservoir involved and the locations of previous studies therefore this section discusses the status of interaction related processes across india through past findings 2 1 river stream gw interaction normally a linear feature like a river stream interacts with gw in two ways bansal et al 2016 saxena and singh 2021 a losing influent stream under this condition the stream stage is higher than the adjoining gw table elevation causing seepage of the flood wave into the aquifer through the streambed b gaining effluent stream in this case the stream stage is at a lower elevation with respect to the regional gw table causing the flow from the aquifer to the stream the losing stream can be connected or disconnected from the underlying aquifer depending on the presence of a saturated or unsaturated zone when the water table is below the streambed saxena and singh 2021 winter et al 1998 india s geographical area is divided into 22 major and composite river basins cwc 2019 many past research projects have been executed from which clear evidence of river stream gw interaction is available in some of these basins fig 3 therefore basin wise information on interaction related processes has been discussed in this sub section 2 1 1 ganga river basin in northern india the holy river ganga originates from gangotri glaciers in the himalayas and after covering approximately 2525 km outfalls into the bay of bengal ganga river basin is amongst the largest alluvial systems that constitute about 26 2 of india s total geographical area and form enormous multi aquifer gw reservoirs with a depth of more than 2000 m maheswaran et al 2016 surinaidu et al 2016 this entire basin is a prominent interaction site between gw and sw maheswaran et al 2016 in the central part of the tarai region in uttarakhand due to excessive gw abstraction by the year 2011 the initial gw level of 0 2 meters below ground level mbgl had changed to 4 6 mbgl during the monsoon season which enabled recharge from the stream water kumar et al 2019 however the level remained unchanged thereafter even when the abstraction activity was extended over the non monsoon season because few shallow streams had disappeared to compensate for the depleting water table dash et al 2015 and sharma et al 2014 reported that infiltrated sw directly influences gw in the upper ganga basin at haridwar srinagar and satpuli due to which production wells along the river banks were used to abstract the mixture of river and gw thus over exploitation of aquifers adjacent to the river has converted ganga s upper stretch into losing streams at various places maheswaran et al 2016 when river ganga enters the plains from the mountains middle segment of ganga e g in the haridwar narora sector of uttar pradesh up gw mainly contributes 28 60 of the river flow during the non monsoon months ala eldin et al 2000 navada and rao 1991 in the central ganga plain between moradabad and budaun districts ganga and mahawa rivers and their tributaries tikta bagad mahawa and bardmar receive a gw effluence of 34x106 m3 year that is responsible for their perennial flow ala eldin et al 2000 however during monsoon months at balawali and hastinapur stations and within the gangeswari gawan reach river ganga becomes influent due to a rise in the stage and gw abstraction recharge imbalance specifically in the budaun district an exceptionally high concentration of arsenic as i e 173 parts per billion ppb has been found in the hand pumps nearby ganga river whose concentration is diluted in the monsoon when compared with the post monsoon season tiwari et al 2016 the availability of as in shallow gw is due to multiple reasons including arsenopyrite present in the river s headwaters beyond this region river ganga while flowing through varanasi in eastern up receives 30 and 25 baseflow contribution during pre monsoon dry season and post monsoon periods respectively whereas in the peak monsoon season flow reversal takes place and aquifers get recharged from the river das et al 2021a most of the shallow aquifers in urban areas get water from river ganga and its tributaries varuna and assi while in the semi urban and rural areas local irrigational canals and ponds are responsible for their recharge das et al 2021b however unsupervised abstraction in the nearby areas resulted in the migration of contaminants such as pesticides pathogens and nitrate from these tributaries to the deeper aquifers via local vertical flow pathways das et al 2021a b it suggested that gw sw interaction governs a major chunk of the aquifer storage and gw quality here downstream of varanasi the lower segment of the river ganga passes through the as affected areas cgwb 2021a here the hydrogeochemical analysis revealed the existence of a subsurface as hotspot close to the river 5 1 259 5 ppb in ghazipur up kumar et al 2010a and in the vicinity of floodplains 87 118 ppb of ganga and its tributary koshi river in bhagalpur bihar kumar et al 2010b thus it signifies a losing stream condition in this region when ganga enters its final course to form a delta it bifurcates near farakka town to form two major distributaries the padma joining the brahmaputra in bangladesh and the bhagirathi hooghly flowing southward via west bengal and ultimately joining the bay of bengal through the largest fluvial deltaic system sundarbans in murshidabad and kolkata districts gw gets recharged from the ganga and the bhagirathi hooghly rivers along with minimal inflow from jalangi and ichamati rivers mukherjee et al 2007 from kolkata the bhagirathi hooghly river then enters the delta region in south 24 parganas district where it contributes 35 41 at 115 mbgl and more than 50 at 333 mbgl depth as gw recharge thus signifying the tidal induced gw sw interaction in the coastal area das and mukherjee 2019 within the bhagirathi and others ganga lower sub basin chakraborty and sikdar 2009 found that kalindri river water a tributary of the mahananda river and gw in the southwestern part of north bengal plain have similar isotopic composition and river receives contributions from gw further downstream remesan et al 2021 studied the gosaba island of sundarbans delta in south 24 parganas and they observed an inflow from tidal rivers gumor and datta into gw during both monsoon and non monsoon seasons the average flux value was simulated as 554 7 m3 day and 554 8 m3 day for the pre and post monsoon seasons however there was a possibility that the river water inflow could result in salinity build up in the topmost layer of the aquifer during the pre monsoon season hence they provided a scenario analysis for installing artificial drains to eliminate water logging and salinity problems from the deltaic island other than ganga its principal tributaries also uphold the phenomenon of gw and sw mixing however limited information is available regarding them table 3 only the river yamuna has been extensively studied however no studies are available for other major rivers such as kosi ghaghara son and mahananda which are also known to sustain the large human population therefore a detailed investigation is required for these water bodies 2 1 2 brahmaputra river basin river brahmaputra is another massive transboundary river that originates from the himalayas and its basin covers areas of tibet china bhutan india and bangladesh cwc 2019 within india the basin is spread over the five northeastern states and the west bengal in the dimapur district of nagaland two of its tributaries i e rivers chathe and dhansiri resulted in moderately to extremely high concentrations of fe 20 mg l and mn 0 1 mg l in the shallow aquifers by virtue of their influent nature kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 their upstream areas lie in the tectonically active area of the assam arakan basin which has large hydrocarbon deposits organic matter in these deposits was mainly responsible for a high concentration of such trace metals 2 1 3 subernarekha river basin the subernarekha river basin extends over three states and contains two major river systems subernarekha and burhabalang cwc 2019 these two rivers have been found to add 508 78 mm3 of recharge to the aquifer system in the balasore district of odisha sethi et al 2002 as a result the conjunctive use of river water and gw was suggested to the state agencies and farmers to avoid further gw depletion in the area 2 1 4 brahmani and baitarni river basin the brahmani and baitarni river basin is distributed among three states with 66 82 of the area in odisha and the remaining area in jharkhand and chhattisgarh cwc 2019 the basin has a total geographical area of 53 902 km2 and 35 65 bcm of water availability in the inland areas of the basin such as the 48 km long bolani gomlai reach of the brahmani river sub basin odisha sahoo and sahoo 2020 and sahoo and sahoo 2019 simulated the river aquifer system for a period of 3 years 1994 1996 and noticed that the river is effluent 0 52 m day in the non monsoon season and influent 0 58 m day in the monsoon season of 1994 however the same river has a lower magnitude of effluent 0 32 m day and influent 0 48 m day fluxes in the non monsoon and monsoon seasons of 1995 respectively a possible reason for this decline in both flux values could be the smaller peak value of rainfall in the year 1995 in comparison to the year 1994 i e the peak value of rainfall directly controls the magnitude of the interaction flux since flooding is common in the catchment when heavy rainfall takes place either in monsoon or due to cyclonic storms wris wiki 2021 with the help of river aquifer interaction excess water can be stored in the basin aquifers which will reduce the adverse impacts of flooding on the nearby land 2 1 5 mahanadi river basin in eastern india the mahanadi river forms one of the largest river basins in terms of drainage area 1 44 905 km2 and its entire catchment lies mainly in chhattisgarh and odisha cwc 2019 in chhattisgarh s raigarh district many steel and power plants consume large amounts of coal from the nearby mines generally mining activity can alter the hydraulic gradients near the gw sw interface and should be avoided in such areas however in one of the coalfields i e gare iv 6 coal block located in the kelo river sub basin a gw effluence of 88 38 m3 day to the kelo river has been estimated which means that the hydraulic gradient of gw flow was towards the river dhakate et al 2019 therefore the continuation of the mining operation was recommended without affecting the river flow provided that a buffer zone with an embankment has to be maintained to prevent the kelo river flood waters from entering the coal block further in some areas of the mahanadi delta gw is significantly affected by the river stage rather than the rainfall for example in the kathajodi surua inter basin odisha mohanty et al 2012 found that the correlation between gw level and river stage was stronger r 0 686 to 0 891 than the rainfall especially in the downstream areas r 0 812 to 0 891 consequently losing and gaining river conditions were observed for kathajodi and surua rivers respectively during the wet season as per the authors this information is useful in ensuring sustainable gw supply for irrigation in the studied area since sw is generally absent during dry seasons and gw is mainly used for irrigation in the post monsoon season 2 1 6 godavari river basin india s second largest river godavari is a perennial river with its catchment extended into seven states cwc 2019 the basin s industrial potential is high and various water quality parameters have crossed the tolerance limits near large cities cwc and nrsc 2014a two decades back in the patancheru industrial development area in medak district nearby hyderabad city telangana gurunadha rao et al 2001 highlighted the issue of poor gw and river water quality to meet irrigational requirements heavy pumping in the alluvium of the nakkavagu stream triggered the seepage from the stream to the aquifer along with a decline in the water table since this stream flows past the industrial area many industries have discharged treated and untreated effluents into the stream resulting in total dissolved solids tds concentrations of 3000 5000 mg l and 1000 3000 mg l in sw and gw respectively thus the induced stream aquifer interaction caused faster migration of industrial effluents in gw up to a lateral distance of 500 600 m from the stream in fact nakkavagu and peddavagu and pamulavagu streams acted as diffused contamination sources before their confluence with the river manjira a tributary of godavari 2 1 7 east flowing rivers between mahanadi and pennar the composite basin between mahanadi and pennar rivers comprises three river systems located between the following major rivers mahanadi and godavari godavari and krishna and krishna and pennar cwc 2019 the whole basin is spread over andhra pradesh odisha and telangana certain problems are associated with sw and gw quality in its coastal areas sw resources are affected by the fishing harbour activities at the estuary tidal water mixing and discharge of municipal sewage and industrial effluents whereas gw suffers from salinity issues cwc and nrsc 2014b particularly in andhra pradesh these problems co exist with the exhaustion of water resources during the summer months therefore intending to provide a safe drinking water supply to the rural population rao et al 2020 investigated the applicability of rbf well at the downstream areas of the varaha river saline coastal tract in visakhapatnam they delineated less saline river aquifer interaction zones at a depth of 6 19 15 1 m resistivity value 14 24 œâ m and drilled an rbf well on the river bank up to a depth of 35 mbgl further they found that water quality improved in the rbf well due to the mixing of sw and gw thus the concept of river gw interaction was effectively used to alter gw s chemical composition and provide potable water to the people 2 1 8 east flowing rivers between pennar and kanyakumari this river basin consists of two river systems the area between the pennar and cauvery rivers and the area between the cauvery river and the coastal town of kanyakumari cwc 2019 its drainage area covers four states primarily tamil nadu and 1 ut in some parts of the basin sw features provide freshwater flux to the aquifers and alter the gw chemistry for example at the common area of the palar and cheyyar river catchments in the kancheepuram district tamil nadu rajmohan and elango 2004 inferred that hydrochemical parameters ph electrical conductivity ec na ca mg k cl hc o 3 c o 3 and s o 4 of the two rivers and gw were similar during the monsoon season they suggested that both rivers substantially influenced gw chemistry and recharged aquifer in the rainy season except for the non monsoon period when the rivers turned effluent further small and large projects have either been executed or are currently under construction and the sw potential of the basin has been almost utilized cwc and nrsc 2014c however in areas around chennai city tamil nadu after the april and may months the reservoir storage declines in some of these projects and gw is extensively exploited for meeting the city s water supply and irrigation demand parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 for recharging the exhausted underlying aquifers checks dams can be built across the losing rivers in the north of the city two influent and independent seasonal october december rivers named arani and koratallai are flowing cwc and nrsc 2014c parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 therefore their interaction related data was utilized to find the right construction site for the check dams 2 1 9 west flowing rivers from tadri to kanyakumari in southwestern india the composite basin of west flowing rivers from tadri to kanyakumari is a part of three states and 1 ut cwc 2019 it comprises the following sub basins netravati and others periyar and others and varrar and others the netravati gurupur river basin in the dakshina kannada district karnataka is highly populated 2 089 649 as per the 2011 census and has significant industrial development cwc and nrsc 2014d the rivers are a vital source of drinking water in the district but only 6 of the total discharge occurred in the nethravati and gurupur rivers during the non monsoon season november july gurumurthy et al 2015 hence gw s contribution to the rivers became crucial for maintaining the water supply after the monsoon s end however in the same district a river named gowri hole showed contradictory behaviour with respect to the nethravati and gurupur rivers kumar and nagaraj 2018 simulated the gowri hole sub catchment for a period of 1 year june 2007 may 2008 and concluded that the river was effluent during the monsoon season and influent during post monsoon and summer months of the year 2008 the river aquifer exchange flux varied spatially within the river segments and temporally in the sub catchment having a magnitude of 31 3 210308 1 m3 day and 638 7 117964 2 m3 day for the gaining and losing conditions respectively 2 2 lake pond gw interaction lakes and ponds are an example of standing or slowly moving sw bodies their interaction with the surrounding aquifers is similar to rivers and streams they can receive sub surface inflow contribute outflow to the aquifers throughout their entire bed or even have both conditions at different places winter et al 1998 however it is difficult to establish the exchange flux between a lake pond and gw lambs 2004 due to subsurface geological complexity and the requirement of a detailed field methodology for appropriate characterisation of the hydro stratigraphy sundararajan and sankaran 2020 nevertheless lake seepage to gw is often a key parameter in the lake water budgets lake management requires knowledge about its surrounding watershed and the environment sundararajan et al 2012 a critical understanding of this exchange is thus essential for the conservation of surface runoff and augmentation of gw resources for subsequent recovery ghosh et al 2015a saleem and jeelani 2017 sanakaran and sundararajan 2014 lake pond gw interaction has been studied across the entire country except for its western region fig 4 in south india authors have mainly focussed on the impact of lake water interaction on gw chemistry tm et al 2017 found that sw interaction and geogenic atmospheric and anthropogenic sources governed the gw quality in the coastal panchayaths of the alappuzha district kerala where potable water supply is under threat due to over exploitation and high content of cl f and fe the interaction of gw with the brackish water of vembanad lake was confirmed by the appearance of cl facies during pre monsoon very high values of ec and tds concentration near the lake ionic ratios mg 2 ca 2 and na cl correlation between cl and so 4 2 anions r 0 70 in non monsoon season and isotopic analysis rajmohan and elango 2004 also observed the same phenomenon in the palar cheyyar interfluve region of tamil nadu where 11 chemical parameters e g ec 250 ¬µs cm were similar for lake and gw representing lake water recharge however apart from water quality the degree of interaction was also determined in the middle peninsular region of india from water level measurements and saturation indices of calcite and dolomite at a proposed uranium mining site in the yadgir district of karnataka manoj et al 2019 identified that melinakere lake on the west always recharges the aquifer but kelaginakere lake on the east allows seepage only during monsoon and receives gw flow during the dry season further in the northeast musi river basin telangana various lakes near hyderabad are polluted due to industrial waste and domestic sewage dumping into their waters sundararajan and sankaran 2020 they contribute a recharge of around 5 mm day to the aquifers sanakaran and sundararajan 2014 according to another estimate from sundararajan and sankaran 2020 the net gw recharge from six major lakes of the basin is 3500 m3 day therefore the underlying aquifers are highly vulnerable to pollution resistivity data along with high tds 1000 mg l and major ion concentrations in gw also substantiate the existence of shallow water table and lake aquifer interaction which means that gw is contaminated near these lakes especially in the downstream areas of the basin sanakaran and sundararajan 2014 sundararajan et al 2012 lake gw interaction has not been studied explicitly but collectively with the river aquifer systems in the northern plains of india most aquifers around the ganga in varanasi city are clay capped and have a hydrological connection with the river however at a distance of 8 22 km from the river sw infiltration occurs primarily through local ponds lakes and areas of discontinuous capping instead of direct surface infiltration and meteoric recharge das et al 2021b few gw samples with higher salinity or ec values 1000 1500 Œºs cm also depicted aquifer recharge from an oxbow lake in the catchment of river gandak lapworth et al 2021 in central eastern india gw recharge rates from the teliabandha lake in raipur city chhattisgarh showed a variation of 3 75 4 82 mm day with the lake water depth ranging between 2 5 and 3 36 m ghosh et al 2015a although this lake received sufficient surface runoff in the monsoon period its water could not be utilized in constructing the mar facility to replenish the city s stressed aquifers due to the presence of limestone formations beneath the lakebed further eastwards a few sw bodies near as affected aquifers in the west bengal were evaluated for their hydrological connection with gw these included ten ponds in the chakdaha block of nadia biswas et al 2014 two ponds in malda chakraborty and sikdar 2009 and one pond in east calcutta wetlands ecw situated on the east of kolkata city sikdar and sahu 2009 at all these sites the isotopic analysis established the involvement of the pond s evaporative water in the gw recharge in addition to the examples mentioned above lake gw connectivity investigations have also been performed for the following a tectonically active site in north east india kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 a large freshwater lake of the south western coastal region sreekumari et al 2016 and artificially created lakes in central everard et al 2020 as well as in the fractured rock terrain of eastern india saha et al 2013 2 3 wetland gw interaction generally a natural depression with the outflow controlled by its temporary varying water storage marks the visualisation of a wetland rahman et al 2016 they are crucial habitats for various flora and fauna and their hydrological biological and chemical functions also benefit the human population junk et al 2013 the wetland s significance is evident from its impact on the downstream flow regimes and gw systems golden et al 2014 and its role as catchment scale buffer storage where it retains runoff during wet periods thereby attenuating the peak flows downstream heimann and krempa 2011 deep seated wetlands with an underlying isolated aquifer system such as the natural wetlands in downstream areas of the musi river basin also act as energy efficient wastewater treatment systems sonkamble et al 2019 the interaction of wetlands with gw is analogous to that of rivers and lakes i e a wetland can receive and contribute water from and towards the aquifer respectively which can happen either exclusively or simultaneously at different locations winter et al 1998 however unlike rivers and lakes wetlands may not always exist in the lower portions of the landscape and they can be present at slopes flat upland areas or along slow moving rivers moreover compared to the lakes gw and sw may not interact freely and quickly through the wetland beds and the exchange magnitude may be affected by the wetlands rooted vegetation winter et al 1998 nevertheless many researchers have recognised such types of interactions e g krause et al 2007 stated that the simulation of wetland aquifer hydrological interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional minimal investigations are available for india s wetland sites which mainly focus on gw pollution in the shallow aquifers of the ecw in the bengal basin gw recharge is composed of meteoric and wetland water sikdar and sahu 2009 where wetland seepage occurs the top aquitard layer is absent and gw pollution is common due to over pumping at the rate of 65 000 m3 day subsequently minimisation of gw sw interaction processes was recommended for the region by managing the tube well operation time and artificial wetland recharge from the roof top rainwater harvesting it would help avoid the inflow of heavy metals cd cr ni pb and cu to the kolkata s urban aquifers at two sites situated north of these wetlands in nadia a change in gw s dissolved organic carbon doc median concentration from 2 42 to 1 5 mg l and 3 21 to 1 78 mg l was observed when the sub surface depth increased biswas et al 2014 this decline in the concentration hinted at the doc export to the underlying aquifer through the wetland gw exchange thereby increasing the risk of as contamination in gw lawson et al 2013 similarly the aquifer s recharge from the floodplain wetlands of river gandak in the indo gangetic basin raised the gw ec values to 1000 1500 Œºs cm in some pockets of the wetland lapworth et al 2021 this activity increased gw salinity and rendered water unfit for consumption contrarily joshi et al 2021 found that delhi s urban wetlands were polluted by the landfill leachate contaminated gw inflow coming from the non engineered landfill sites in their vicinity high concentration of trace metals pb cd and mn was reported in their aquifer systems regarding the wetlands of national importance semwal et al 2020 observed that the aquifer system of the sukhna lake basin in chandigarh was receiving sw seepage some authors have also discussed the internationally significant wetlands ramsar sites danish et al 2020 calculated the submarine groundwater discharge sgd contribution as 20 of the total water inflow to the chilika lagoon on odisha s coast even in the harike wetland in punjab gw is free from heavy metal contamination on account of the recharge from the wetland s water singh et al 2020 however due to excessive gw pumping and intensive agricultural practice an infiltration gradient has been set up between the wetland lake and the aquifer because of which the wetland ponded area squeezed by 6 13 in 12 years all the studies as mentioned earlier have used experimental methods in contrast to this rahman et al 2016 developed a physics based model swatrw soil and water assessment tool for riparian wetland and tested it on the hakaluki haor wetland within the transboundary barak kushiyara river basin shared between north eastern india bangladesh 9 and myanmar 1 swatrw adequately modelled the hydrological interactions between rivers gw and wetlands where the aquifer seepage component represented 92 of the wetland s annual outflows this model actually worked on a robust bidirectional approach featuring darcy s law based wetland gw interaction algorithm instead of the unidirectional interaction approach of the existing soil and water assessment tool swat models 2 4 seawater gw interaction seas and oceans are saline water bodies where most terrestrial rivers seek their destination seawater and gw interact in coastal areas through seawater intrusion and sgd debnath et al 2019 seawater intrusion is the inland movement of seawater towards the freshwater coastal aquifers lenntech 2016 generally caused by natural processes like rising seawater levels significant evaporation and density driven forces and human activities such as excessive gw pumping kim et al 2017 raja et al 2021 this phenomenon modifies the gw chemistry and leads to the salinisation of freshwaters for instance during high tide in the coleroon river estuary tamil nadu gw contains ca mg c l and hc o 3 hydrochemical facies which indicate its mixing with the saline water at a point 9 km away from the coast raja et al 2021 during the covid 19 lockdown enforcement in the year 2020 the maximum values of ec and tds in gw of thoothukudi formerly tuticorin district increased from 4210 to 5687 Œºs cm and 5456 to 6520 mg l respectively owing to the absence of human activity and existence of seawater influence only selvam et al 2020 similar conditions were also identified by satheeskumar et al 2021 at the thamirabarani river delta where more than 40 of the gw samples tds 1000 mg l were affected by seawater intrusion demonstrating the unsuitability of water for drinking purposes increased saltpan activities as inferred from the samples having cl b r ratio above the standard values 288 292 were the main cause of seawater ingress in this deltaic region in the case of sundarbans region where mangrove forests control gw salinity das and mukherjee 2019 analysed the impact of seawater on the delta front aquifers at a depth of 14 25 mbgl the average gw salinity for all seasons was 30 ppt parts per trillion and the seawater constituted 63 of the gw fraction in the pre monsoon which plunged to 57 in the post monsoon period likewise at a depth of 30 50 mbgl the average salinity reduced to 18 ppt and the seawater proportion changed from 58 to 51 for deeper depths this proportion further dropped to 30 thus seawater intrusion was more prominent in the shallow aquifers since gw potential was reduced due to excessive abstraction on the other hand sgd refers to the combined subsurface seepage of terrestrial sourced fresh gw t sgd and recirculated sea marine water m sgd to the oceans at continental margins danish et al 2020 debnath et al 2019 moore 2010 these fluxes portray as a vital source of nutrients solutes and contaminants to the coastal ecosystem with their chemical isotopic composition altered along the discharge path danish et al 2020 das et al 2020 the flux exchange occurs at different scales irrespective of the fluid composition and driving forces moreover the tidal cycle and offshore distance govern the discharge composition for example at the chandipur coast odisha debnath et al 2019 discovered that t sgd and m sgd components were dominant during the low and high tides respectively in the pre monsoon phase the t sgd fraction increased to 88 for an offshore distance up to 45 m from the high tide line while the m sgd fraction lay within 97 37 for the offshore distance of 50 110 m however in the post monsoon phase t sgd share reached a maximum value of 99 up to 110 m distance and m sgd remained insignificant apart from the sgd composition das et al 2020 examined the ecohydrological response to the sgd borne nutrient flux in this coastal tract algal blooms were witnessed due to the annual discharge of 240 mm m2 day of no 3 flux into the bay of bengal i e sgd improved the biological productivity of this marine ecosystem hence accurate estimation of sgd flux is necessary for understanding the global chemical budgets of various elements however this assessment is a tedious exercise because of the non point and spatio temporal behaviour of the flux charette et al 2008 danish et al 2020 somehow tried to address this problem by presenting fixed and variable sgd composition approaches for the chilika lagoon both methods estimated the sgd flux to be around 1 5x106 m3 day which assured that the variable sgd approach is suitable for proper estimation of varying sgd fluxes only a few examples of seawater gw interaction studies have been illustrated in this article which is related to the eastern coastline for more information about other areas readers are requested to refer to table s2 in the supplementary information section 2 5 interaction in the himalayan region the indian himalayan region covering about 16 2 of india s geographical area and hosting more than 31 million people represents a highly dynamic and fragile ecosystem sensitive to global climate change and anthropogenic modifications panwar 2020 unfortunately regarding gw sw interaction studies it has been discriminated against other geographical features of india barely some information is available on the chemical composition of streams and springs irrespective of their societal importance jeelani 2005 jeelani et al 2011 which is discussed below karst topography constitutes some part of south eastern kashmir jeelani et al 2011 this valley area is a part of the indus river basin located between the lesser and greater himalayas winter et al 1998 defined the karst terrain as a landform created by the dissolution of carbonate rocks like limestone and dolomite where aquifers are structured as dual or triple porosity systems with laminar flow in fissures matrix and turbulent flow in the conduits hence water movement is quite unpredictable in such terrain at lower altitudes of the kashmir valley the stream and spring waters have similar tds content 250 mg l which is indicative of the recharge of these karst springs from the bringi liddar and adigam streams jeelani et al 2011 recently bhat and jeelani 2018 also observed that the streams in the bringi watershed contributed 337 35 and 7 5 m3 s of gw recharge during the high and low flow periods respectively even lake gw exchange was rarely evaluated in this mountain range lake nainital of uttarakhand was designated as a flow through type of sw body since sub surface water was involved in the lake s inflow and outflow processes saravana kumar et al 2001 gw contribution constituted 46 61 of the lake s annual inflow and the seepage towards the aquifer was 49 65 of the lake s annual outflow nachiappan et al 2002 indeed the lake s water replenished the unconfined aquifers that ultimately discharge into the hydraulically connected downstream springs another important tourist destination the dal lake of kashmir valley is known to be effluent in nature the aquifer supplies comprised 23 40 of the lake water budget with an annually averaged flux of 276x103 m3 day saleem and jeelani 2017 which is quite significant from the resource management point of view 3 interaction of gw with anthropogenic sw bodies human activities have always impacted water resources quantity quality and distribution including the interaction between gw and sw winter et al 1998 this impact can be described in both affirmative and negative ways for instance recharging exhausted contaminated aquifers or sw contribution to the gw system through mar methods are the positive aspects of human interference with the natural systems on the other hand any change in the quantity quality of the existing water sources caused by human induced disturbances in the connected water body is an example of a negative aspect past studies have covered both aspects in the indian context fig 5 which is described subsequently 3 1 interaction at artificial drainage sites artificial drainage is a system of man made drains built to remove excess water from the surface or sub surface specifically rootzone regions commonly the drains exhibit gw sw interaction processes especially by the open unlined drains sewage channels which pollute gw on a large scale because of their perennial nature kumar et al 2006 the najafgarh drain of delhi carrying domestic sewer and excess fertiliser input is a key example of such pollution within river yamuna s delhi segment the drain itself constitutes 60 share of the total drain discharge to the river downstream of its convergence point with the river the contaminated water of this drain and other major drains severely affects the gw chemistry kumar et al 2009 e g 10 15 times higher average po 4 3 concentration has been observed in the downstream gw sw samples when compared with the upstream samples during the pre monsoon period so 4 2 dominance in the deeper aquifers throughout post monsoon season also corroborate this observation similarly budhiya nala and gaunchi drain in faridabad haryana have resulted in high levels of f cl and so 4 2 ions in gw kumari et al 2018 on the contrary artificial drains also play a crucial role in water management in the semi arid peri urban agricultural areas of haryana delhi traversed by the same najafgarh drain baudron et al 2016 discovered that the drain created a geochemically low evolved gw region 0 7 4 ms cm in its vicinity and consistently provided significant aquifer recharge irrespective of its intermittent monsoon controlled regime consequently it acted as a hydraulic barrier to prevent the mixing of brackish 4 1 23 4 ms cm and fresh 0 5 to 2 3 ms cm gw flowing through the northern and southern parts of the area respectively in odisha s balasore district also surface drains provided 43 25 mm3 of gw recharge sethi et al 2002 recently in the gosaba islands remesan et al 2021 performed a scenario analysis to assess the drainage infrastructure s suitability in reducing saline waterlogging conditions they predicted that provision of three drains would solve the purpose and it will be accompanied by the decline of gw discharge to the river along riverbank boundaries additionally during pre monsoon river inflow to the island s gw system will be minimised from 554 7 m3 day to 463 7 m3 day while during monsoon and post monsoon seasons the river influx will be increased roughly from 180 to 225 m3 day and 105 to 290 m3 day respectively they argued that a steeper gradient from the river towards the drain within the gw system should be responsible for such kind of flux variation throughout the wet period 3 2 interaction at canal sites canals have been constructed in india to supply water from major rivers to areas with low water resource potential and cater to the living population s multiple needs like artificial drains seepage losses also occur through unlined canals but freshwater is added to the aquifers instead of stormwater runoff or sewage prime evidence of canal gw interaction is available at a rbf site in haridwar wherein pumping from production wells forced sw to flow through porous media and mix with gw dash et al 2015 the canal operation directly influenced the production wells surrounding the upper ganga canal ghosh et al 2015b within the yamuna basin the western and eastern yamuna canals were involved in the local recharge of the underlying aquifer ahmed and umar 2009 alam and umar 2013 kumar et al 2006 apart from these major canals in the basin the canal network in the kali hindon inter stream region was releasing an annual seepage of 16 26 mm3 to the aquifer due to which gw mounds were created in the area umar et al 2008 in the gandak basin the eastern main canal has helped maintain gw recharge to the shallow aquifers up to 40 mbgl in the upper and middle parts of the catchment lapworth et al 2021 however the canal leakage decreased on moving towards the lower portion of the catchment other areas where gw flow contributions from canals were identified include the martandnag karst spring area of kashmir valley jeelani et al 2011 ghaggar river basin in north western india joshi et al 2018 semi arid regions of haryana saharawat et al 2011 2009 singh et al 2006b singh et al 2006a industrial parts of faridabad kumari et al 2018 lower ganga ramganga inter basin area in 4 districts of up pradhan et al 2021 peri urban and rural areas of varanasi das et al 2021a command area of mahi right bank canal in kheda gujarat rastogi and prasad 1992 paddy dominated hirakud command area in odisha wable et al 2021 dwarka river floodplain in birbhum west bengal mondal and gupta 2015 and neighbourhood of bhangar canal in ecw sikdar and sahu 2009 canal based gw recharge depends on canal sub surface infiltration capacity the extent of the wetted perimeter and canal length ahmed and umar 2009 unlined canals significantly influence gw in a basin thereby improving agricultural productivity farmer livelihood and maintaining a high water table especially during dry periods jha et al 2009 being a simplified and cost effective approach to sustainable gw management in developed and developing nations iwmi 2002 thus recommended this technique for the western indo gangetic plain where the water table is rapidly declining due to gw over pumping 3 3 interaction at reservoir sites reservoirs created behind dams are normally suitable for mar where increased contact time between impounded water and riverbed aids the infiltration process such mar techniques are useful in conserving excess runoff during monsoon and ensuring water availability during subsequent non monsoon periods parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 the check dam constructed on the arani river flowing north of chennai added 1 3 mm3 63 of its cumulative storage of water to the aquifer storage in 8 months which raised the gw level from 1 to 3 5 m for a 2 km distance along with the lowering of major ion concentration parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 at the end of the structure s life 75 years it was even predicted that 97 5 mm3 of water would be infiltrated into the aquifer at a nominal cost of rs 1 2 per m3 thus check dam construction provided dual benefits it improved aquifer conditions and gw quality recently parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 delineated a 1 5 km stretch of the aquifer from the check dam in which a group of wells was directly under the dam s influence the impact of dam structures on gw configuration has also been studied for f rich gw sites of kaldurai village in tamil nadu karunanidhi et al 2020 different hydro projects in kerala and maharashtra kumar et al 2008 a small dam near salri village in madhya pradesh oblinger et al 2010 and a limestone terrain near owk reservoir in andhra pradesh where springs emerge from the base of the hillock abutting left flank of the gollaleru earthen dam noble and ansari 2017 however reservoir based mar is not a viable affair always in the drought prone areas of buldhana district in maharashtra keesari et al 2020 showed that the pentakli and koradi dam reservoirs were only contributing 0 5 5 and 0 9 1 of total recharge to the shallow 2 5 23 mbgl and deep 30 160 mbgl aquifers respectively a major chunk of gw recharge was provided by the irrigation return flow followed by the rainwater infiltration and gw residence time varied between 2 and 4 years which was a sign of the low water potential of the aquifer therefore other artificial recharge measures and rooftop rainwater harvesting were recommended for improving the gw potential kanke and dhurwa dam reservoirs in an urban area of jharkhand also shared a similar story saha et al 2013 further joseph et al 2021 used flow health assessment to show that the existing dam reservoirs and agricultural practices adversely affected the high and the low flows in the upper and lower son river basins respectively together with a decline in the basin gw level however if the reservoir releases are reduced to ensure minimum flows and the cropping patterns are modified then an improvement in the river s health and gw levels can be expected artificial excavations and small scale on farm reservoirs can also be considered low cost alternative mar methods to dam based reservoirs for example in the lateritic terrain of kharagpur city of west bengal the water level of three abandoned excavations had a strong correlation with gw level r 0 81 and these excavations provided a significant recharge of 1 90 2 99 cm day to the deep aquifers machiwal and jha 2016 water level correlation was high r 0 84 for the on farm reservoirs as well but their involvement in the recharge was relevant only when the area received less rainfall therefore artificial excavations turned out to be more reliable for mar in this case 4 methodology for determining the extent of gw sw interaction various techniques are available for characterising the exchange between gw and sw these include conventional methods such as hydrologic measurements isotopic and hydrochemical analysis or modern tools like geophysical methods and numerical modelling for a better understanding many people have also applied them in combination but selecting an appropriate method is governed by its suitability economy accuracy and investigation objective the following section illustrates the different techniques used in india 4 1 tracer analysis historically water tracers have been used to delineate catchments estimate gw s flow velocity and its recharge areas and discover pollution sources especially for the karst aquifers generally these tracers are classified into four categories artificial labels dyes salts particulates spores fluorescent microspheres bacteriophages natural labels microorganisms solution ions environmental isotopes and pulses natural and artificial ford and williams 2007 in india environmental isotopes stable and radioactive are most popular in interaction related studies followed by chloride ions cl and ec based tracers a significant variation in the gw and sw concentrations of them helps in identifying the interaction coluccio and morgan 2019 for instance heavier isotopes of oxygen 18 o and hydrogen 2 h or deuterium d get concentrated in the denser phase during a phase change in the hydrological cycle thereby initiating isotopic fractionation among the phases gupta and deshpande 2005 these hydrological processes provide a characteristic isotopic signature to different water sources it is represented in Œ¥ notation i e deviations with respect to international standard of known composition in parts per thousand eq 1 1 Œ¥ i n r x r s 1 1000 where rx ratio of 18o 16o or d h in the sample of water source and rs isotopic ratio of the standard Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values are calculated relative to standard mean ocean water smow or the equivalent vienna smow vsmow standard to study the extent of interaction between different water sources including precipitation a Œ¥d vs Œ¥18o plot is then drawn and these isotopic parameters are compared in a similar manner cl concentration and ec measurements of various sources are juxtaposed to determine the gw sw connectivity cl concentration is obtained using hydrochemical analysis ion chromatography or standard titration method while ec values are measured using a multi parameter probe or conductivity meter heat tracers are another type of tracer in which the streambed temperature profiles are used for obtaining exchange fluxes from the analytical solution of the 1d steady state heat diffusion advection equation kumar et al 2009 naganna et al 2017 the main advantage of the isotopic method is that it enhances the understanding of the hydrological processes occurring within a system stable isotopes of o and h are integral parts of water molecules making them ideal tracers for tracking water movement however while performing isotopic analysis the available isotopic data and ground based and airborne meteorological data are often insufficient for quantitatively describing the interactions among different hydrological cycle components das and mukherjee 2019 gupta and deshpande 2005 cl method is cost effective showing zero loss during evaporation and overall reduced uncertainty in the results hence it is also known as a conservative tracer nachiappan et al 2002 however if the concentration difference between two sources is small then its applicability is restricted for the heat tracer method the unavailability of sw and gw temperature data has undermined its relevance in front of darcy s flux estimation approach sahoo and sahoo 2019 o and h isotopic analysis is commonly applied in gw sw interaction investigations das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a dhakate et al 2019 gupta and deshpande 2005 lambs 2004 mukherjee et al 2007 navada and rao 1991 parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 stable isotopes of carbon 13 c are also used sometimes along with 18 o and 2 h for understanding the role of carbonate dissolution in gw chemistry tiwari et al 2016 for estimating sgd in coastal areas strontium isotopes 87 s r 86 s r are generally preferred danish et al 2020 in addition to stable isotopes many researchers also use radioactive isotopes such as tritium 3 h bhat and jeelani 2018 chakraborty and sikdar 2009 keesari et al 2020 sikdar and sahu 2009 umar et al 2008 besides environmental isotopes cl tracer has also been extensively applied in quantifying meteoric water composition in gw chemistry inferring geochemical processes and delineating regions affected by irrigation return flow bhat and jeelani 2018 das et al 2021a debnath et al 2019 gurumurthy et al 2015 keesari et al 2020 kumar et al 2006 nachiappan et al 2002 parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 in fact satheeskumar et al 2021 used the chloride bromide ratio cl br to define the seawater intrusion other than conservative tracers compounds like chlorofluorocarbon c f c 11 12 and sulphur hexafluoride s f 6 have been employed as gw residence time tracers for determining the characteristics of gw recharge lapworth et al 2021 the ec data has also been adopted as a tracer in a few studies das et al 2021a gurumurthy et al 2015 parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 however no study is available regarding the heat tracer approach 4 2 hydrochemical analysis gw quality is affected by geochemical formations in aquifers recharging water composition ion exchange human activities and other environmental conditions avtar et al 2013 kumar et al 2010b tiwari et al 2016 despite the popularity of tracer tests researchers do not prefer them frequently for quantifying the impact of sw on gw because they are time consuming expensive and may welcome environmental and legal problems hydrochemical analysis can be considered as an alternative to the tracer techniques involving estimation of the quantities such as ph ec tds oxidation reduction potential dissolved oxygen temperature turbidity alkalinity hardness and the major ion chemistry dash et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 rao et al 2020 sharma and dutta 2020 in the major ion analysis usually concentrations of cations such as na k ca 2 mg 2 li and anions such as f cl br hco 3 co 3 2 so 4 2 no 3 po 4 3 are measured through the laboratory analysis the hydrochemical analysis is a simple rapid and relatively cost effective affair specifically information regarding the gw major ion chemistry is beneficial in finding solute sources and understanding water evolution because of water rock interaction silicate weathering and ion exchange processes jeelani et al 2011 hence such type of analysis has been applied in india to characterise the extent of gw sw exchange jeelani et al 2011 keesari et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 manoj et al 2019 parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 rajmohan and elango 2004 rao et al 2020 sharma and dutta 2020 and identifying sources responsible for gw contamination avtar et al 2013 das et al 2020 dash et al 2015 gurumurthy et al 2015 kumar et al 2006 2010b a raja et al 2021 satheeskumar et al 2021 tiwari et al 2016 4 3 multivariate statistical techniques for distinguishing between sw and gw components many authors have analysed hydrochemical and isotopic data using multivariate statistical techniques like end member mixing analysis emma principal component analysis pca tracer based hydrograph separation and factor and cluster analysis pca is a statistical scheme for reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset while retaining most of its original variance thus enabling the linear conversion of a multivariate dataset into uncorrelated variables in the descending order of variance das et al 2021b keesari et al 2020 it provides information regarding the relative contribution of individual components in altering the chemistry of a local hydrologic body selvam et al 2020 emma and hydrograph separation methods are governed by the mass conservation principle coluccio and morgan 2019 emma technique based on pca defines the end members and their relative proportions in the gw chemical composition keesari et al 2020 and develops a set of equations considering more tracers than the components on the other hand the tracer based hydrograph separation technique delivers data related to the spatiotemporal origin of streamflow components and gw discharge rates occurring between the reach and catchment scale kalbus et al 2006 factor and cluster analyses are another way of analysing the water quality data factor analysis is a numerical method of obtaining relatively significant entities among all the variables that demonstrate parameter variation or hydrochemical processes kumar et al 2006 assumptions are made regarding the present population from which samples have been selected and new variables are obtained from a linear combination of many variables kumar et al 2009 it is further sub classified as i r mode factor analysis it describes the interrelationship among the variables analysed ii q mode factor analysis it describes the interrelationships among the collected samples or objects in a dataset cluster analysis however is an investigative tool that sorts different objects into groups based on the fact that the degree of association is maximum between two objects belonging to the same group in general multivariate statistical techniques help in the simplification and reorganisation of large datasets to accomplish general data recommendations avtar et al 2013 gurumurthy et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 2010b they highlight the key parameters governing the overall chemistry between different sampling datasets and the connection between different sampling locations which would otherwise be difficult to find with only general geochemical and hydrological data however there are some disadvantages associated with these techniques pca s main problem is that interpreting the principal components is difficult and a balance between information loss and dimensionality reduction must be maintained in the case of emma unstable end member solutions and unrealistic mixing assumptions are considered the limitations for the tracer based hydrograph separation the isotopic composition of event and pre event waters is quite similar in many cases but variable in position and time kalbus et al 2006 which limits its applicability regarding factor analysis naming the factors can be tricky since multiple attributes can be highly correlated without any solid reason despite these drawbacks these statistical techniques have been used for interaction studies pca has been used by das et al 2021b gurumurthy et al 2015 keesari et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 and selvam et al 2020 emma finds application in determining gw recharge sources geochemical processes and storm runoff das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a debnath et al 2019 keesari et al 2020 nachiappan et al 2002 das et al 2021a used tracer based hydrograph separation in quantifying gw flux input to the fluvial baseflow in ganga gurumurthy et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 kumar et al 2006 kumar et al 2010a kumar et al 2010b and tm et al 2017 applied r mode factor analysis in their investigations while q mode factor analysis and cluster analysis was used only by kumar et al 2009 for displaying the control of the fluid exchange distributions at multiple scales 4 4 hydrological measurement based analysis hydrological variables discharge and hydraulic head have been extensively applied in describing the gw sw exchange s lumped value this value is obtained from water budgeting a type of mass balance approach based on eq 2 umar et al 2008 2 total inflow t o t a l o u t f l o w c h a n g e i n s y s t e m s t o r a g e here inflow represents the sum of precipitation sw and gw inflow outflow constitutes actual evapotranspiration sw and gw outflow and system storage means catchment water storage coluccio and morgan 2019 artificial catchment water level changes are also considered in it if the gw budget is considered all recharge and discharge components of an aquifer system are noted ahmed and umar 2008 dhakate et al 2019 umar et al 2008 apart from the budgeting water level fluctuations in sw and gw are also utilised for characterising the degree of their interaction since a connected aquifer system promptly responds to the recharge discharge of water with respect to time and season manoj et al 2019 the water level difference is incorporated as a hydraulic gradient into darcy s equation eq 3 which is then used to calculate gw exchange with the sw body coluccio and morgan 2019 kalbus et al 2006 3 q k a Œ¥ h Œ¥ l here q flow volume a cross sectional area perpendicular to flow direction k hydraulic conductivity Œ¥h difference in hydraulic head difference in gw levels for horizontal flow through gw sw interface or difference in gw sw levels for vertical flow through their interface and Œ¥l distance between points of hydraulic head measurement water budgets are commonly applied at river reach and catchment scales where it is assumed that any gain loss of sw is linked to the water source and subsequently the gw component can be identified and quantified coluccio and morgan 2019 kalbus et al 2006 however they are inefficient in assessing small scale interaction processes since flux estimation accuracy is constrained by the accuracy of the measurement of other components of the budget scanlon et al 2002 the scarcity of data collection mechanisms also affects their output resolution darcy s method is suitable for small scale applications with an existing network of wells however high costs will be incurred if new wells need to be installed accurate estimation of hydraulic conductivity of a large area is also a tedious job in this method the water budget method has been applied in the evaluation of lake gw interaction saleem and jeelani 2017 and gw exchange with rivers canals ahmed and umar 2008 dhakate et al 2019 umar et al 2008 and check dams parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 the water level fluctuations were more relevant than the water budget method during the monsoon period when substantial seasonal hydraulic head fluctuations were observed in rivers lakes and gw they played a significant role in defining the mode of interaction in the river aquifer systems of the ganga and the yamuna das et al 2021a kumar et al 2009 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 and in the lake aquifer system of the bhima basin in karnataka manoj et al 2019 4 5 geophysical methods geophysical exploration tools are a recent advancement in interaction studies in this approach the physical property differences in density elasticity magnetism and electrical resistivity within the earth s crust are interpreted as subsurface inhomogeneity comprising variation in lithology and water quantity and quality chahar 2014 the most common geophysical technique is the electrical resistivity or ec measurement it involves electric potential difference measurement between two electrodes in an electric field induced by two current electrodes sending direct current dc into the ground and subsequent derivation of the earth s electric properties from the obtained data the dc resistivity techniques can be field operated either in profiling lateral traversing mode to identify lateral changes and near vertical features or in sounding vertical electrical sounding ves mode to determine geoelectric horizon depths chahar 2014 sundararajan et al 2012 the ves method provides information about the thickness and depth of subsurface layers and the extent of gw exploitation in them sundararajan et al 2012 typically the dc resistivity survey and ves method produce 1d geoelectric cross sections containing the thickness and resistivities of all geoelectric units layers however when 2d and 3d cross sections are obtained using multi electrode combinations line or grid arrangement then the resistivity method is termed electrical resistivity tomography ert mclachlan et al 2017 it can detect apparent resistivity changes with depth and degree of water saturation in general multi electrode resistivity imaging tools combine sounding and profiling that complement the traditional resistivity methods in providing a detailed picture of the sub surface sundararajan et al 2012 equipment portability and rapid measurement are the key advantages of the electrical resistivity method chahar 2014 moreover sub surface resistivity data finds application in delineating silt clay zone thickness the extent of the pollution caused by contaminant concentration near gw sw connections and locations for observation well drilling sundararajan et al 2012 it is also useful in the gw flow model development since it reveals the details of aquifer geometry sundararajan and sankaran 2020 however errors can feature in the geophysical ves interpretations because of deviations from the assumptions of horizontal and isotropic sub surface layers sundararajan et al 2012 by and large these interpretations are not unique due to the principle of equivalence and suppression nevertheless the ves method has been used by parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 and sikdar and sahu 2009 for the aquifer s geological characterisation at a check dam and a freshwater wetland site respectively das et al 2020 recently applied ert to scrutinise a coastal aquifer media s vertical to perpendicular shoreline resistivity distribution few studies have also employed a combination of ves and ert surveys to understand better the sw gw system rao et al 2020 sundararajan et al 2012 but other geophysical tools such as ground penetrating radar and seismic methods have been rarely used 4 6 direct measurement methods bag type or automated seepage meters can directly determine an area s gw discharge or recharge zones these devices work on the principle of isolation and coverage of a portion of the interaction interface through a bottomless cylinder kalbus et al 2006 this cylinder is connected to a deflated plastic bag for a bag type seepage meter when gaining conditions prevail the volume of collected water is measured and gw flux to sw is calculated if losing conditions prevail a known volume of water is added to the bag before field installation and then the infiltration rate is calculated from the volume loss in an automated seepage meter instruments are placed instead of the bag to continuously record the water flow rate through the outlet conduit automated devices provide temporal seepage variations and have the edge over conventional devices seepage meters are considered inexpensive and operationally simple however direct measurement of exchange flux is problematic in certain areas because of seawater circulation through the seepage face in coastal regions and spatiotemporal complexities in solute concentration the instrument cannot clearly identify the sources contributing to sgd debnath et al 2019 in the case of braided rivers it is less effective and difficult to apply coluccio and morgan 2019 moreover for obtaining representative flux values multi point measurements are required kalbus et al 2006 which is not an easy job in india seepage meter experiments were performed only for quantifying sgd to the bay of bengal bag type seepage meters were used in two areas chandipur s micro tidal coast in odisha das et al 2020 debnath et al 2019 2018 debnath and mukherjee 2016 and coleroon estuary in tamil nadu prakash et al 2018 however no study was available regarding the automated seepage meters 4 7 modelling in recent times modelling has emerged as a powerful tool that is simple comprehensive and economical compared to previously discussed methods it can help partially replicate the behaviour of a complex natural system and determine the parameters that govern the exchange flux generally models are categorised into mathematical and physical models anderson et al 2015 the former being mainly involved in gw sw interaction studies process based mathematical models consist of governing equations applicable to the problem domain and a set of initial and boundary conditions based on the solution method these models are further classified into analytical and numerical models all the models mentioned above are subsequently illustrated along with some unique modelling applications 4 7 1 analytical models analytical models are used to obtain a closed form solution of the differential equation that represents governing mechanism in the problem domain their applicability is limited to simple systems and they are irrelevant in most practical gw problems anderson et al 2015 since many assumptions are made that help simplify the model conditions for obtaining analytical solutions zipper et al 2022 however in the past few years their functionality has been enhanced by the involvement of irregular boundaries xian et al 2021 and multiple sources of recharge discharge liang and zhang 2012 wu and hsieh 2019 additionally minimal data expertise and computational demands have encouraged several authors to use them in interaction studies zipper et al 2022 for instance in a fully penetrating stream aquifer system aquifer hydraulic diffusivity hd ratio of aquifer s transmissivity and storage coefficient has been estimated through the laplace transform method for any variation in the stream stage mishra and jain 1999 this method followed a more straightforward approach than the conventional least squares optimisation since it automatically assigned less weight to the latter part of the aquifer s response to the boundary perturbation an explicit expression of hd has also been derived considering linearly varying stream stage singh 2003 which was subsequently modified by singh 2007 to account for the entrance head loss for a given laboratory data the modified model could identify and discard the inconsistent values and therefore it provided consistent estimates of hd at different sections further bhandari et al 2018 worked out an approximate analytical solution for the interaction between a stream and an unconfined horizontal aquifer with a recharging effect they used the variational homotopy perturbation method which solves the non linear boussinesq equation the analytically obtained water table profiles agreed with the numerically obtained profiles and hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were identified as sensitive parameters under similar conditions rai and singh 1995 framed a 2d expression for the water table profile using a finite fourier sine transform approach but assumed that the transient aquifer recharge occurred through an overlying rectangular basin instead of the adjacent stream the analytical solution was applied to a numerical example for the constant recharge rate the water table was observed to rise with time for the transient recharge rate the water table increased to a maximum height and then started declining in addition to unconfined aquifers an analytical model was also presented for a confined aquifer system which is connected with a constant piezometric head at one end and constantly rising stream water level at the other end along with continuous rainfall contribution through surface infiltration bansal and das 2009 the model s application established that the stream water rising rate and surface infiltration factors governed the net stream aquifer volumetric exchange apart from the horizontal aquifers analytical models are also available for the unconfined sloping aquifers for which eq 4 gives the governing boussinesq equation bansal 2012 chapman 1980 4 k cos 2 Œ≤ x h h x k sin Œ≤ cos Œ≤ h x r t s h t where k hydraulic conductivity h hydraulic head measured above the inclined base in a direction normal to the horizontal x axis Œ≤ slope of the aquifer base r t transient downward recharge per unit aquifer area and s specific yield considering the linearised form of the boussinesq equation the analytical solution was developed for gw hydraulic head and flow rate in a stream sloping aquifer system bansal 2012 upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 when a constant recharge was applied over this system the water table height increased and decreased with the aquifer s slope for the recharging and discharging aquifers respectively upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 however in the case of a transiently varying recharge the gw mound drifted laterally depending on the aquifer s slope bansal 2012 later studies assumed a vertical sedimentary clogging layer in between aquifer and stream to obtain analytical expressions for water head distribution discharge rate and net volumetric exchange bansal 2017 bansal et al 2016 the hydraulic resistance of this sedimentary layer affects the inflow outflow at the interaction interface hence when linearised boundary condition was considered for the system the analytical formulations could provide acceptable results only for small streambed leakance and head loss across the streambank bansal et al 2016 however when considering non linear boundary conditions the analytical formulations accurately modelled the gw sw interaction even for large values of stream stage variations and streambed leakance bansal 2017 most of the analytical solutions as mentioned above were developed for the stream aquifer systems however very few authors have extended the analytical modelling approach to other sw gw systems e g ghosh et al 2015a mentioned a semi analytical model for finding out the extent of unsteady gw recharge caused by the water level variation in a large water body such as a lake and its underlying aquifer the model performed satisfactorily since the temporal variation of the computed lake water depths was similar to the observed lake water depths with reasonable accuracy this study also ascertained the practical applicability of analytical modelling in investigating gw sw interactions 4 7 2 numerical models the choice of a suitable mathematical model is governed by the hydrogeologic complexity and field data availability ahmed and umar 2009 in certain situations where simple models are insufficient for the simulation of complex conditions it is obligatory to solve the partial differential equations numerically using digital computers often numerical models are based on the finite difference fd or finite element fe method facilitating the simulation of steady state or transient gw flow in 3d heterogeneous media with complex boundaries and a network of sources sinks anderson et al 2015 they can be used in both direct and inverse types of aquifer problems chahar 2014 and are also helpful in framing various management and policy actions related to watershed management by accepting the basin wide detailed impact scenarios as inputs kalbus et al 2006 maheswaran et al 2016 in the context of gw sw interaction computer modelling provides abundant information about real world issues ranging from local or regional scale to future projections coluccio and morgan 2019 e g it is worthwhile for achieving the optimal allocation of limited resources singh 2014a based on complexity these models can be distinguished into simple conceptual models treating gw as reservoirs where inflows outflows are specified and complex integrated models having more realistic physical coupling coluccio and morgan 2019 the interaction related models suffer from certain drawbacks as well flow differences at the start and termination of a river reach are often minor compared to the total river flow thereby constraining the accuracy of gw inflow outflow estimates ahmed and umar 2009 rushton 2007 regional average streambed thickness and hydraulic conductivities influence the flux estimates in large scale models ahmed and umar 2009 regarding hydraulic conductivity estimation for modelling it is tough to gather representative samples considering the fluvial bed anisotropy heterogeneity and geohydrological conditions and then drive into a realistic statistical and spatial interpretation based on this field and lab data naganna et al 2017 another limitation is that some of these constructed models can be data and computationally expensive to run e g balamurugan and murty bhallamudi 2016 and sahoo and sahoo 2020 while some models are unable to produce precise results due to scarcity of calibration data remesan et al 2021 in the case of popular gw models such as modflow it does not consider catchment geomorphology in the flux assessment and when streamflow is fed mainly by the baseflow its river boundary package riv also doesn t simulate the flux accurately sahoo and sahoo 2019 table 4 chronologically summarises some numerical modelling studies related to the gw sw exchange in india according to it about 50 of the studies preferred the modflow modelling code in conjunction with either riv boundary conditions or swat for the sw component modflow is a fd code that solves the governing equation of gw flow eq 5 and is commonly used in gw flow modelling 5 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z r s s h t where k xx k yy k zz hydraulic conductivity along x y and z directions respectively h hydraulic head above datum r source sink in terms of the volumetric flux per unit aquifer volume s s specific storage of the porous medium and t time the modflow based models have been able to simulate the gw sw system accurately since the r2 value in these studies was more than 0 9 with respect to the hydraulic head however at mining sites and deltaic islands this value was reduced to around 0 5 which means that these models were not so effective in modelling complex systems dhakate et al 2019 remesan et al 2021 apart from computer models other studies in table 4 have used numerical models to validate analytical expressions that were developed to study the stream aquifer exchange under different aquifer geometries and boundary conditions overall except for gurunadha rao et al 2001 roy et al 2015 dhakate et al 2019 and sundararajan and sankaran 2020 the remaining publications have included either only transient state analysis or both steady as well as transient state analysis thereby suggesting the suitability of these numerical models in gw sw interaction studies which is practically a time varying phenomenon 4 7 3 physical models physical models directly measure gw heads and flows mainly at the laboratory scale anderson et al 2015 frequently sandbox models are engaged in simulating simple aquifer systems where boundaries are scaled down and hydraulic conductivity s spatial distribution is modified chahar 2014 for example pahar and dhar 2014 performed a sandbox experiment with irregular boundary conditions to verify the results of an integrated gw sw interaction model developed for a generalised ground surface profile a novel dry zone wet zone theory formed the fundamental basis of this numerical model the numerical simulation results were well correlated with the experimental results for the rising tide but deviated slightly for the falling tide in coastal regions 4 7 4 miscellaneous applications of modelling certain studies cover special applications of gw sw interaction modelling for instance bandopadhyay et al 2018 demonstrated that shear flows caused by topographic relief and hydraulic head gradients increased the transient mixing dynamics of transported dissolved chemical species and created mixing hotspots underground analytical solutions were provided for a pulse and a front initial solute distribution inferences from this study can help understand the effect of hydraulic head gradients on mixing processes at the gw sw interface kumar and pahar 2020 also constructed a 2d depth averaged continuum framework for simulating the gw sw exchange the generalised hyperbolic framework is free of ad hoc coupling and the model is potentially applicable to vertical sloping interface conditions and different time scales 5 application of gw sw interaction concept the concept of gw sw interaction is involved in various water resources development and management programs some of these conceptual applications are discussed below 5 1 conjunctive use of gw and sw in irrigated agriculture the agriculture sector holds a major stake in the indian economy however rising stress on gw and sw sources in quantity and quality has diverted the scientific community s attention towards conjunctive water use in this integrated approach gw and sw are collectively utilised to improve the water supply for agriculture especially in canal irrigated areas where interactions between them are pretty significant kumar et al 2013 singh 2014a singh 2014b such practices are advantageous in dealing with water shortages increasing overall crop production and water use efficiency reclaiming waterlogged lands by increasing gw extraction utilising poor quality water along with fresh water and disposing off effluent from sub surface drainage systems singh 2014b a well managed conjunctive use system provides better output than an individual source for example underground water storage through leaky dams check dams injection wells or aquifer storage recovery wells is preferred over surface storage owing to fewer losses in them singh 2014b wrachien and fasso 2002 however the non applicability of the conjunctive use approach may lead to a demand supply imbalance thereby causing deterioration of the canal irrigation system kumar et al 2013 conjunctive water can be applied either in a cyclic manner canal water followed by saline water naresh et al 1993 or through freshwater blending with poor quality water before field application the former approach being preferred singh 2014b the most common technique for managing conjunctive water systems is simulation optimisation so modelling so models are integrated in two ways singh 2014a a embedding approach in linear programming lp based models discretised flow equations are accounted as constraints and the simulation model forms a part of the optimisation model however its application is limited to small scale steady state problems due to high computational costs and numerical difficulties peralta et al 1995 b response matrix approach here discretised flow equations are computed separately and the response matrix is incorporated into the model using the superposition principle so models are structured tools to achieve a balance between gw withdrawal and sw exhaustion barlow et al 2003 and they can account for complex water allocation problems singh 2014a various types of so models have been used in india e g lp based models mohan and jothiprakash 2003 singh and panda 2013 tyagi and narayana 1981 vedula et al 2005 non linear programming models gupta et al 1987 chance constrained lp models lakshminarayana and rajagopalan 1977 maji and heady 1978 mishra 1975 artificial neural networks based models rao et al 2004 and genetic algorithm based models raju and kumar 2004 however so models require recurring simulations of the state variables while carrying out optimisation leading to a computationally expensive approach for conjunctive water use ghosh and kashyap 2012 their integration is complex and computations may take a long time to produce an optimal solution singh 2014a ghosh and kashyap 2012 provided an alternative to so models in which approximate and computationally inexpensive linked kernel optimisation models were developed to obtain near optimal solutions towards cropping and associated gw pumping pattern in the hindon yamuna interbasin the solution was further fine tuned using physically based simulators here the kernel function describes the system s response typically water table fluctuations towards a unit impulse pulse of the input e g gw pumping maddock 1972 under dynamic equilibrium the kernels are planned with respect to crop areas versus state variables maximum water table depth and stream aquifer interflow relations however the additional computational cost is also incurred when simulations are run for generating kernel models 5 2 water resources development and management researchers are now focusing on integrated water resource development and management strategy with the rise in complex environmental problems in the hydrological cycle the connection between gw and sw components has helped sort out various water related issues in developing countries especially sustainable gw management in india has been implemented through cost effective and straightforward sw based recharge techniques for instance percolation tanks ponds and abandoned dug wells have been used to recharge shallow unconfined aquifer systems in alluvial and hard rock terrains jha et al 2009 reddy 2012 samra et al 2002 under the andhra pradesh farmer managed groundwater systems apfamgs project water harvesting measures like injection wells and abandoned open wells have been taken up for transferring flood flows into over exploited aquifers apfamgs 2006 reddy 2012 canal irrigation has also been instrumental in recharging aquifers since canal flows strongly influence the gw levels goel and jain 2006 in the command area of srisailam right branch canal in andhra pradesh gw recharge and water levels increased during the post project period and if an optimum level of canal supplies is adopted then up to 48 of allocated canal water could be saved which can be reallocated elsewhere in the irrigated area kumar et al 2013 unfortunately the linkage between surface and sub surface water also has far reaching environmental consequences especially for communities directly dependent on gw the interaction governs the level of resource exploitation beyond which these communities would face negative externalities reddy 2012 in general studies have considered gw sw interaction in water resource management through different models or a nationwide watershed development wsd policy ratha and agrawal 2014 developed an integrated systems mathematical model to define the structure of a water resources development and management system based on graph theoretic and matrix models and facilitate optimum decision making using strengths weaknesses opportunities threats swot analysis it was superior to the system analysis approaches e g lp for decision making since the model considered interaction among the water resource management system s sub systems including gw and sw development sub systems consequently the model was applied to a gw development sub system in patiala punjab to improve gw s quality and quantity the wsd policy for india has also improved the understanding of natural resources management although it intends to upgrade the livelihoods of rural communities through increased sustainable production syme et al 2012 its implementation has some challenges since the hydrological scale determines the extent of gw sw interaction most of the wsd policy execution has been done at the micro scale 500 ha which may not lead to optimal hydrological economic and equity outcomes therefore syme et al 2012 suggested adopting four watershed levels basin sub basin meso and micro in india and as per the requirement the best scale or level needs to be chosen keeping transaction costs of scale modification in mind birner and wittmer 2004 further indian gw management policies in the past were regulation centric rather than focussing on empowering the communities relying on gw for their daily livelihoods lack of accurate and reliable data complex scientific analysis for actual users provision of gw development incentives in sensitive regions and generic recommendations on gw sw linkages instead of location specific remedies have led to the failure of these policies reddy 2012 therefore reddy 2012 recommended a framework termed reduce resource evaluation estimation distribution location users communication execution to achieve sustainable gw management at the community level it bridges the gap between a resource its estimation and distribution and the user by stressing communication and execution of relevant scientific information such approaches can improve wsd policy s relevance for the general public 6 discussion and recommendations 6 1 challenges faced in the interaction studies after a deep understanding of the different aspects of gw sw interaction learning about the common problems encountered in evaluating such processes is necessary as per the literature mentioned above different natural systems pose different challenges in interaction studies complex hydrodynamic conditions exist at the river channel confluences with irregular boundaries including separation of flow and formation of a shear layer and flow stagnation zone lambs 2004 consequently identifying the contributing waters using isotopic data is often problematic if they have a similar origin in the case of lake water budgets gw recharge discharge cannot be accurately measured due to subsurface geological complexity and the requirement of detailed field methodology for suitable hydro stratigraphic characterisation sundararajan and sankaran 2020 moreover lake gw interactions may have uncertainties due to data shortages or human and instrumental errors saleem and jeelani 2017 sgd quantification is also challenging because of the spatial and temporal complexities of the heterogeneous aquifer structure das et al 2020 debnath et al 2019 in situ monitoring can be performed for relatively small sites to assess wetland hydraulic interactions with other water sources while hydrological or hydraulic modelling is preferred for large scale studies rahman et al 2016 however hydrometric time series of storage area and depth are not frequently available for wetland modelling studies data collection in a mountainous region such as the himalayas is often tedious because of natural disasters and unprecedented weather changes which can cause interruptions and rapidly modify the existing site conditions besides natural systems anthropogenic activities like mining operations can form additional ponds in an area and cause sw diversion or changes in gw sw interaction stream alignment and water quality kay et al 2006 manoj et al 2019 concerning the application part of the interaction phenomenon the conjunctive use approach has gained significance over time in india s agricultural development however excessive use of bad quality water in poorly drained soils can render salinity build up in them singh 2014a the applicability of so conjunctive use models in practical works is also undermined due to their large data requirements complexity and model parameters kumar et al 2013 in the case of water resource development management activity the practical applicability of the available system models wsd policies is constrained by the accuracy of data acquisition techniques and the data s size and quality even the resource estimates are accompanied by various scale issues reddy 2012 moreover implementing environmental management policies mainly depends on the political administration s will das et al 2021b therefore to overcome these challenges extensive data collection and new techniques are required so that proper assessment of the interaction processes is possible with minimum scope for errors 6 2 critical analysis of gw sw interaction from a national perspective india faces water stressed conditions table 1 despite having a vast water resource potential of 1999 bcm and an average annual precipitation of 3880 bcm cwc 2022 significant progress has been made in the water related infrastructure development through the completion of many projects of the major river basins which provide a total live storage capacity of 257 812 bcm cwc 2021 however for several reasons the availability of both sw and gw in uncontaminated form is still at risk literature shows that information pertaining to gw sw interaction has been very helpful in dealing with the water security issues of different regions in the country fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 in north india the indo gangetic plains are drained by the perennial himalayan rivers and mainly river aquifer systems have been investigated especially in up and uttarakhand additionally an extensive canal network is in place in this region mohanty et al 2012 and canal based seepage has been evaluated in the fertile areas of punjab haryana western up and border areas of up bihar however river sites in punjab and haryana and canal sites in central up have not been considered where certain areas are either susceptible to drought or have low water table conditions near highly urbanised areas of delhi many sw bodies are located but a large population still suffers from water related problems hence multiple sw bodies including drains canals wetlands and rivers have been considered for their connection with gw in the himalayan region 16 internationally significant wetlands spread over four states wetlands of india portal 2020 and some major dam reservoirs are present but except for some lakes none of them has been explored for their suitability in freshwater management saleem and jeelani 2017 similarly in northeast india 20 internationally significant wetlands exist along the course of the river brahmaputra wetlands of india portal 2020 but scarce information is available for the entire region even in the central indian states of madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh where 26 5 and 24 65 of gw assessment units respectively have been classified into over exploited critical and semi critical categories cgwb 2021a and about 50 of the rural population is getting potable water within their premises through pipe water supply cwc 2021 only five studies have been conducted which are insufficient within the peninsular region seawater gw interaction has been studied along the entire coastline to analyse chemical budgets of various elements protect aquifers from salinity exposure and understand coastal ecology yet most of the information is available for tamil nadu only apart from the coastal areas sw features in the plateau and the western and eastern ghats have also been analysed for their sub surface connection although their number is less than the available sw bodies for example in western india i e gujarat and maharashtra canal and dam sites have only been studied at four locations likewise in the five southern states excluding canals artificial drains and seawater all other sw gw systems have only been recognised at 19 sites however interestingly eastern india is the second most investigated area after the north region primarily because of poor gw quality data from 24 sites cover all types of natural and anthropogenic sw bodies here braided rivers also flow through the sundarbans deltaic region representing a complex gw sw interaction system these vital freshwater rivers are highly dynamic in nature having meandering channels wide bars and inconstant flow levels that can sustain unique ecosystems coluccio and morgan 2019 for example gw seepage towards the himalayan sourced brahmaputra jamuna river flowing through india and bangladesh helps maintain the baseflow during winter sarker et al 2014 in the bay of bengal the river also receives gw inflow moore 1997 from region wise analysis it is clear that interaction based studies have been performed on four types of physical features i e mountains plains plateaus and coastal plains however the desert and island landscapes have not been evaluated extensively in the arid areas of north western india particularly at sites near the thar desert in rajasthan people mainly depend on gw due to the lack of sw accessibility although some reservoirs lakes canals and rainfed ephemeral rivers are also present coyte et al 2019 reported that gw was contaminated due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources and the aquifers were receiving recharge from meteoric water and ambiguous sw sources therefore additional investigation is needed for this terrain in the upcoming studies likewise in the andaman and nicobar and lakshadweep group of islands a small population lives with limited water resources and hydraulic data availability gw is a major freshwater source for the people and therefore only seawater intrusion of the island aquifers has remained in the research focus banerjee et al 2012 chattopadhyay et al 2015 chattopadhyay and singh 2013 gopinath et al 2013 maury and balaji 2015 mondal et al 2009 najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 sarwade et al 2007 singh 2008 singh et al 2009 sundaresan 1993 karst topography has also received similar treatment regarding the number of available publications karst aquifers contain gw of economic interest and about 25 of the world s population relies on them for water needs ford and williams 2007 even though limestone formations potential karst aquifers cover about 2 of india s physical area chahar 2014 most of the karst related research has been restricted to the kashmir valley only since these aquifers can amplify the flow and transport mechanisms of gw sw exchange and welcome several environmental consequences it is imperative to explore them further especially in the areas where extreme climatic events cause large scale destruction from the available information various key issues related to gw sw interaction have been identified which are summarized in fig 6 natural forces e g weather changes geogenic interaction as well as human activities e g modification of sw environment or excessive gw pumping are responsible for the issues representing negative impacts of gw sw interaction particularly in the case of unsupervised gw abstraction it not only lowers the water table but also aggravates the interaction process due to which gw contamination and sw drying are initiated in addition to excessive gw withdrawal artificial contaminant sources like intensive agricultural practices improper district level sanitation systems untreated sewage and industrial wastewater disposal into sw bodies and the presence of municipal landfills or mines near the interaction site are responsible for the deterioration in the quality of interacting water bodies avtar et al 2013 dash et al 2015 dhakate et al 2019 kumar et al 2010b manoj et al 2019 tiwari et al 2016 another important outcome from the literature is that the ecological significance of gw sw interaction still lacks the cognizance of the scientific community key topics that were covered in the literature include nutrient supply related vegetation growth and sw degradation das et al 2020 singh et al 2020 sonkamble et al 2019 and maintenance of ecological flow in the river joseph et al 2021 lapworth et al 2021 sharma and dutta 2020 however the significance of riparian vegetation along the riverbanks and various in stream inhabitants has not yet been evaluated riparian vegetation influences the exchange fluxes of water and other related substances such as nutrients or doc gupta and deshpande 2005 and its information helps understand the mixing of waters and their dynamics lambs 2004 similarly many in stream inhabitants help maintain the stream s ecological health and are often affected by the changing hydrological events 6 3 key inferences regarding the available methodology as discussed in section 4 seven techniques have been broadly used in india for describing gw sw interaction by virtue of limitations and inherent uncertainties of individual techniques their combination was sometimes applied for a better understanding of the processes kalbus et al 2006 however they were used for a small area or a major river basin only and an analysis of their regional scale applicability is missing which is indeed a challenging task because of india s diverse geography hence this aspect of interaction related measurement techniques is discussed in the current section our literature review shows that according to location india s physical area can be divided into six main regions and a peninsular coastal region table s4 maximum studies in the northern region have analysed the interaction processes using hydrochemistry and hydrological measurements followed by the isotopic composition the significant distinction in the gw sw characteristics is responsible for such observations this area hosts an extensive network of perennial himalayan rivers and canals carrying large volumes of sw additionally there is immense pressure on gw in quantity and quality in certain areas due to intensive agriculture industrialization and increasing human population apart from these techniques very few sites have used multivariate statistics and basin and sub basin scale mathematical models a similar trend of methodological application was also observed for the eastern region but the isotopic analysis was preferred over hydrochemical study and island and reach scale numerical models were developed for river aquifer systems regarding the north eastern region insufficient publications have denied any generalisation about the applicability of available techniques in the western region the situation is entirely different from the northern region as a limited number of natural sw sources are present and gw is accessible at moderate to deeper levels 5 10 mbgl as per government data of april june 2021 hence mainly reservoir gw interaction has been studied through isotopic and hydrochemical analyses however water budgeting and mathematical modelling have been preferred in the neighbouring central region for rivers lakes and reservoirs for gw of the southern region although its recharge and chemical composition were primarily evaluated using hydrochemical parameters other methods such as conventional approaches numerical modelling and geophysical techniques were involved only at a limited number of sites further in india s coastal belt isotopic hydrochemical and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to understand seawater gw interaction however sgd flux was also measured using a seepage meter and resistivity methods in some cases from the above discussion it is clear that three main conventional techniques were popular among all the regions of india unfortunately modern techniques could not gain a reputation to such an extent researchers and scientists have under utilised methods such as emma which are otherwise well known for more accurate quantification of the recharge sources and supply of critical information especially in drought prone regions keesari et al 2020 likewise geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar or seismic magnetic electromagnetic methods etc have not been used for gw exploration in the past since the ambiguity in resistivity survey results is similar to other geophysical methods chahar 2014 applying several complementary geophysical approaches under an integrated exploration program would be better than a single approach for gw prospecting while developing numerical models for indian sites most authors have applied either loosely coupled models based on modflow or adopted modflow with its relevant packages these models underestimate infiltration flux in the case of disconnected rivers and neglect transitional stages between fully connected and fully disconnected river flow regimes brunner et al 2010 when the riv package is applied streambed parameters are either determined indirectly or employed as a calibration factor tripathi et al 2021 moreover such models show their inability to simulate complex geological features unsaturated aquifers steep hydraulic gradients and multiphase flow these limitations can be addressed with the help of fully coupled models such as opengeosys and hydrogeosphere they are physics based and completely describe the hydrological cycle and the connection among different processes through various spatiotemporal scales hence future studies could be performed using these advanced tools for various indian sites 6 4 government level problems and institutional framework for future studies at the government level the concept of gw sw interaction is still not appropriately recognised in the currently enforced national water policy 2012 there is no direct mention of gw sw interaction although the emphasis has been laid on the river s ecological flow saline water intrusion in coastal water bodies conjunctive use of sw gw integrated water resource management and establishment of artificial gw recharge projects ministry of jal shakti 2012 in 2016 two legislative bills were drafted for the national water framework and gw conservation protection regulation management which mentioned gw sw interaction in principle but did not discuss the procedure and techniques for its characterization ministry of jal shakti 2016a ministry of jal shakti 2016b further in a few publicly available documents issued by the water sector governmental organisations only a particular aspect of interaction has been covered for example cgwb 2015 and wenninger 2020 were related to the application of numerical modelling and stable isotopic analysis respectively while cgwb 2021b was focused on artificial gw recharge structures furthermore no national level standards have been laid down for the appraisal of gw sw interaction through various available techniques e g guidelines regarding parameter selection for hydrochemical analysis are unavailable even in the recent assessment of nationwide dynamic gw resources based on the water balance approach fig 2 there is a flaw in the method of gw recharge estimation from non rainfall sources in the estimation formulas of recharge from canals tanks and ponds and water conservation structures as given in table 5 predetermined recommended values of recharge seepage factor have been used in the absence of field or scientific studies which may not present an accurate picture of gw recharge moreover to some extent only baseflow contribution to streams and seawater gw connection has been considered but gw connectivity with wetlands or artificial drains has not been characterised in short a conceptual framework for conducting gw sw interaction studies is missing therefore a simple institutional framework is proposed which will provide government agencies and other stakeholders with a systematic approach to undertake comprehensive investigations for any gw sw setup fig 7 it consists of nine steps to be followed to obtain meaningful outcomes the workflow begins with identifying study objectives or key issues about the quantity and quality of water resources and related ecosystems e g the disappearance of shallow streams mar or gw contamination in the second step the whole problem is conceptualized by defining the study area and choosing the appropriate scale of investigation regional geography and other location specific characteristics are also considered then the interacting water sources are listed based on the observations and existing hydrological maps multiple sw sources natural or anthropogenic could be connected to the underlying aquifer system in a particular area e g rivers and seawater in coastal tracts rivers and canals in alluvial plains with a spatially and temporally varying transition zone at their place of connection this zone can alter the exchangeable water s ecological flow and biogeochemical conditions and is constituted of the gw sw interface hyporheic zone and ecohydrological interface conant et al 2019 unfortunately as per our knowledge this conceptual zone has not been considered in india s context therefore the transition zone will play a significant role in analysing gw sw interaction in the upcoming studies after defining the water sources data pertaining to general and specific characteristics of the gw sw system is collected it includes climate hydrological hydrogeological watershed and chemical characteristics external stresses e g anthropogenic factors recharge and discharge sources and biological parameters based on this information the relevant methodology is selected from the bunch of available techniques for which the government must finalise the parameters and guidelines in future a combination of techniques is preferred over their individual application since it will provide more confidence in the experimental outcomes subsequently assumptions are made to simplify analysis and fulfil missing parameters gw sw system is then evaluated and results are analysed using various statistical and graphical tools e g resistivity images piper trilinear plots Œ¥d vs Œ¥18o plots hydrographs from this analysis the impacts of gw sw interaction on the environment and human life are determined quantitatively the impacts can be visible in the form of increased baseflow contributions during the dry season or the rise of water table near unlined canals while qualitatively these impacts can be witnessed through gw contamination from wastewater discharge into sw or sw contamination arising from agricultural return flows that infiltrate into the soil local ecology is also affected by the interaction processes for instance unsupervised gw abstraction at the river s proximity can reduce the population of endangered aquatic species because of ecological flow reduction hence considering this information regional management strategies are prepared these include establishing riparian areas buffer strips land use and water resources management or wastewater treatment and discharge policy subsequently the strategies are incorporated into a legal policy structure whose effective implementation will be ensured by the local administration in this policy the role of each stakeholder government non governmental organisations affected communities shall be fixed and a periodic feedback mechanism will also be in place that will improve the policy provisions from time to time as per the requirement overall the entire institutional framework will provide a comprehensive solution to the problems associated with gw sw interaction processes 7 conclusion the management of gw and sw resources is incomplete without knowing the interaction between them this phenomenon is governed by numerous factors and has far reaching consequences on both environment and humanity in a vast and geographically diverse country like india significant inequality is witnessed between the availability and demand of water because of the swiftly growing population anthropogenic implications and limited resource availability therefore awareness of the countrywide water source interaction based research is required to tackle this inequality this article presented an organised account of the previous works on gw sw interaction processes in indian waters most of the past publications focussed on two key issues unsupervised gw abstraction and the presence of contamination sources near a water body moreover the commonly evaluated gw sw systems had rivers streams canals or seawater as their sw components however most of the studies were site specific without providing a generalised perspective and in many cases the interaction was not considered in totality for example only streams and lakes have been evaluated in the himalayan region similarly only 9 out of 22 major and composite river basins have been investigated for river aquifer interaction with prime emphasis on the ganga basin on a regional scale india s western and central regions were under evaluated certain critical sites have also remained unreported in the literature these include dam reservoirs and wetlands in the himalayas eco sensitive areas in north eastern india sgd sites at islands and desertic and karstic terrains thus all such regions should be inspected in future to estimate the extent of interaction regarding the available methodology for evaluating the interaction conventional techniques such as isotopic hydrochemical and hydrological analyses were more popular than modern techniques like geophysical methods multivariate statistical techniques and numerical modelling however many problems associated with the use of conventional techniques were identified such as the unavailability of a sufficient quantity of isotopic meteorological and hydrologic data experimental cost environmental and legal problems and inefficiency in the assessment of small scale interaction processes modern techniques also had certain drawbacks such as consideration of unstable end member solutions and unrealistic mixing assumptions while using emma errors in the geophysical interpretations due to their non uniqueness and computational and data collection expenses of numerical models in the case of complex gw sw systems yet they were still considered better than the conventional techniques because of equipment portability rapid measurement and ability to describe the interaction processes completely the concept of interaction also needs more recognition at the government level currently in various governmental reports very few details are available for the interaction mechanism and primarily baseflow addition to streams and seawater gw interaction to some extent have been considered additionally no national level guidelines have been issued for selecting the appropriate methodology and there is a flaw in the estimation procedure of gw recharge from non rainfall sources therefore a general institutional framework is proposed beginning from the identification of objectives to the implementation of management policies it allows various stakeholders to undertake detailed investigations for any gw sw setup overall in indian conditions gw sw interaction is essential in any water management plan hence newer data collection and analysis methods should be preferred in the upcoming projects remote sensing methods like airborne thermal infrared imaging and advanced geophysical techniques like ground penetrating radar or airborne electromagnetic survey can be used they enable the collection of large scale data and information from inaccessible areas in terms of modelling fully coupled or integrated models rely on a more significant number of model parameters than the loosely coupled models and hence they are recommended for analysing complicated gw sw setups multivariate statistical techniques should also be given priority for analysing large hydrochemical datasets and deducing meaningful results broadly speaking a single method may not provide complete confidence in the analysis results and therefore multiple methods should be applied for each specific problem to minimize the uncertainties involved in complex water systems it will be helpful in the effective resolution of

1860,worldwide highly populated countries are experiencing an imbalance between the supply and demand of water india is one such example which has only 4 of the world s water resources and a population of more than 1 3 billion its water demand is expected to rise by more than 75 in the upcoming decades due to fast population growth and expansion of irrigated agriculture industrialisation and urbanisation the consequences of this increased demand are already visible such as water quality deterioration near urban centres water table lowering in the north western region and seawater intrusion in coastal areas due to aquifer over exploitation the occurrence of erratic and unreliable rainfall in the past few years has further aggravated the situation in such a scenario information on groundwater surface water gw sw interaction processes is helpful for the conservation and management of water resources therefore this study thoroughly reviews the interaction phenomenon occurring in indian waters it covers the interaction in natural and artificially constructed environments methods for exchange flux quantification conceptual applications and challenges in accomplishing these investigations rivers streams canals or seawater were considered as sw components in the majority of the studies with the main focus on the ganga river basin in the case of river aquifer systems however most of the investigations were site specific without providing a generalised perspective and in many cases the interaction was not considered in totality also certain critical sites have not received the attention of the scientific and research community these are dam reservoirs and wetlands in the himalayas eco sensitive areas in north eastern india submarine gw discharge sites at islands and desertic and karstic terrains on a regional scale very few research articles are available for india s western and central regions accordingly all such regions need to be explored in the upcoming studies in the context of flux quantification methodology modern techniques like geophysical methods and fully coupled numerical models were used fewer times than conventional techniques such as isotopic hydrochemical and hydrological analyses therefore extensive data collection and modern methods are recommended to study complex systems and obtain more accurate information further the government sector seems reluctant to recognise this concept since in various reports complete information is unavailable for the interaction mechanism and only some aspects of the phenomenon have been considered additionally there are anomalies in the gw recharge estimation from non rainfall sources hence we suggest an institutional framework that allows the stakeholders to undertake detailed investigations for any interaction setup and frame an appropriate strategy for handling the country s water issues keywords groundwater surface water interaction water resources management conjunctive use groundwater over exploitation water quality institutional framework data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater gw and surface water sw resources are key components of the natural hydrological cycle that help sustain life on earth over the past few decades they have been undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic activities and natural processes garc√≠a ruiz et al 2011 thereby limiting freshwater availability for human consumption conventional studies have separately focused on the quantity and quality of gw and sw for resolving such problems winter et al 1998 however with the enhancement of scientific knowledge and improvement in measurement and modelling techniques scientists have supported the idea of investigating the connection between gw and sw to facilitate their effective conservation and management kalbus et al 2006 therefore the concept of gw sw interaction has become very popular in recent years gw interacts with the sw primarily by three mechanisms roy et al 2015 winter et al 1998 a sw recharges gw banks et al 2011 e g losing stream b gw discharges into sw li et al 2019 li et al 2017 e g gaining stream and c gw recharge and discharge may co occur at different locations of sw cartwright et al 2014 the degree of interaction depends on several factors these include regional topography cey et al 1998 roy et al 2015 wang et al 2016 underlying geology wang et al 2016 sub surface hydraulic properties kumar et al 2009 martinez et al 2015 westbrook et al 2005 temporal variation in precipitation cey et al 1998 kumar et al 2009 roy et al 2015 seasonal changes in sw and gw level das et al 2021a martinez et al 2015 roy et al 2015 continuous pumping of water roy et al 2015 the difference in opinion of hydrologists and hydrogeologists concerning the selection of methods models for investigating gw sw interaction saxena and singh 2021 and other fluvial anthropogenic and geological processes das et al 2021a martinez et al 2015 subsequently gw sw interaction plays a central role in the management of water resources ranging from water allocation during low flows sahoo and sahoo 2019 yang et al 2014 pollutant filtration grischek and ray 2009 naganna et al 2017 nutrient regulation sahoo and sahoo 2019 aquifer replenishment alam and umar 2013 jha et al 2009 naganna et

environmental flow maintenance hendriks et al 2014 sahoo and sahoo 2019 to the regulation of oceanic strontium sr budgets beck et al 2013 danish et al 2020 for instance river bank filtration rbf and managed aquifer recharge mar techniques based on gw sw interaction can improve the quality and availability of gw ghosh et al 2015a rao et al 2020 sharma et al 2014 similarly coupled gw sw models have helped assess river stream environmental flows joseph et al 2021 a detailed investigation of gw sw interaction is therefore crucial in the context of a vast country like india that is facing a rapid decline in per capita availability of water mohanty et al 2012 rao et al 2020 table 1 india is the seventh largest nation globally the great himalayas borders its northern part while its southern peninsular region meets the bay of bengal on the east the arabian sea on the west and the indian ocean on the south the mainland is situated entirely in the northern hemisphere extending between latitudes 8 4 and 37 6 north and longitudes 68 7 and 97 25 east and it has four main physical features including mountains plains desert region and southern peninsula national portal of india 2020 on either side of the peninsula a group of islands also belong to india in totality the country s water resource potential has been estimated as approximately 1999 billion cubic meters bcm which is significant for the national economy cwc 2021 according to the estimate of the standing sub committee of m o jal shakti d o mowr 2000 given in table 2 the total water demand will increase by 78 in 40 years for various sectors with irrigation having a majority stake 74 in it similarly from the nciwrd 1999 estimate the minimum and maximum total water demand will increase by 40 and 66 in 40 years table 2 however fulfilling these growing freshwater requirements is challenging for numerous reasons india has a whopping population of more than 1 3 billion about 17 1 of the world s population with just 4 of the world s water resources total annual utilisable water resources 690 bcm sw 433 bcm gw 1123 bcm indicating the inequality between the demand and supply of water adri 2017 this inequality will become more significant in the future india will remain under water stressed conditions for the coming decades since the population is expected to rise to 1 628 billion along with the decline in per capita water availability to 1228 m3 year by 2051 table 1 the increasing population will create an annual food requirement of more than 250 million tons and total grain demand of 375 million tons by 2050 thus generating additional demand for water cwc 2019 other contributing factors to water inequality include climate change impacts increased water demand for industry and energy production slow pace of water infrastructure development and insufficient investment inefficient use of water accelerated urbanization and the expansion of municipal water supply sanitation systems cwc 2019 there is an uneven spatial distribution of water for the living population many big cities such as mumbai jaipur bhatinda lucknow nagpur and chennai are experiencing acute water shortages compelling their administrations to opt for water rationing during the summer months ghosh 2021 some of these urban centres still lack a sustainable conservation strategy and alternate water sources appropriate quality drinking water is scarce in rural areas especially drought prone regions udmale et al 2016 recently a national assessment of dynamic gw resources revealed that irrigation use constitutes 89 217 61 bcm of the total annual gw extraction 244 92 bcm while domestic and industrial use make up its remaining 11 share 27 3 bcm cgwb 2021a consequently gw is depleting more than its recharge due to its overexploitation in many states adri 2017 especially in north western india cgwb 2021a pumping wells with a free power supply provided by the government have resulted in rapid depletion due to excessive gw abstraction heavy seawater intrusion is witnessed in coastal areas rendering the agricultural lands unsuitable for cultivation hence the knowledge of gw sw interaction can solve the problems mentioned above suppose either of these water sources faces any quantity or quality related issues in that case the other source can be used to improve the condition of the degrading source provided they are connected in that region conversely suppose one source is responsible for the quality deterioration or reduction in the volume of water in the linked source in that case suitable arrangements can be made to minimise the exchange between them and protect the degrading source many interaction studies are available for different locations in india they have covered a variety of natural settings and anthropogenically modified sites using both conventional and modern methodologies especially after 2009 the number of publications has increased significantly from around 3 year to more than 9 year fig 1 indicating that this issue has become a trending research topic in the past few years however the available literature is disorganised since many of these works are confined to local scale or site specific investigations without providing any broader outlook for framing a national water management policy the occurrence of gw sw interaction in different environments and the applicability of multiple methods for its extent determination have made it difficult to generalise the information and derive meaningful conclusions for example instead of using groundwater surface water interaction explicitly many authors have used the terms like stream aquifer interaction lake groundwater interaction submarine groundwater discharge seawater intrusion etc which creates problems while searching for relevant information related to the interaction phenomenon moreover some significant critical zones from the national and environmental perspectives have been unreported in past research therefore this study presents a comprehensive and systematic review of different research works carried out in india from 1991 to mid of 2021 on the subject of gw sw interaction its main objective is to inform various stakeholders policymakers and scientists about the current information related to the connectivity of sw and gw challenges encountered during such investigations and possible areas for future research initially this article illustrates gw sw interaction studies in different natural systems followed by anthropogenically modified systems then it describes various approaches adopted for characterising the interaction and the conceptual applications finally a relevant discussion and useful recommendations have been provided for deep insight into this topic 2 gw sw interaction in different natural systems natural sw features like streams rivers lakes ponds wetlands seas and oceans often interact with gw toran 2019 winter et al 1998 as per the latest government records the recharge from monsoon as well as non monsoon rainfall constitutes around 64 280 06 bcm of india s total annual gw recharge while recharge from other sources is about 36 156 08 bcm cgwb 2021a here recharge from other sources means canal seepage irrigation return flow and recharge from tanks ponds water conservation structures water bodies etc cwc 2021 since due to climate change the estimate of gw recharge from rainfall is somewhat unreliable therefore assessing the connection between gw and sw becomes significant and cannot be ignored in fact out of this 156 08 bcm of non rainfall recharge 52 9 takes place during the non monsoon season implying that gw sw interaction is more important for maintaining gw resources when monsoon season is not prevalent in the country the state wise variation of annual non rainfall gw recharge further supports the above statements fig 2 except for the north eastern states excluding tripura and nagaland and island union territories uts rest of india has a substantial component of non rainfall gw recharge particularly states and uts of north and north western india namely delhi haryana punjab chandigarh jammu and kashmir and ladakh have at least 60 of their annual gw recharge coming from such sources these areas are a part of the indus and the ganga basins which have an extensive river network furthermore in rajasthan delhi haryana and punjab the stage of gw extraction is more than 100 cgwb 2021a a significant proportion of the aquifer recharge from non rainfall sources in these states implies that the gw sw interaction concept can help deal with the depleting water table issues a major limitation of the above data is that it does not specify the environment in which interaction is occurring natural systems or anthropogenically affected sites the type of mechanism and its spatiotemporal variability the type of sw body e g river lake tank reservoir involved and the locations of previous studies therefore this section discusses the status of interaction related processes across india through past findings 2 1 river stream gw interaction normally a linear feature like a river stream interacts with gw in two ways bansal et al 2016 saxena and singh 2021 a losing influent stream under this condition the stream stage is higher than the adjoining gw table elevation causing seepage of the flood wave into the aquifer through the streambed b gaining effluent stream in this case the stream stage is at a lower elevation with respect to the regional gw table causing the flow from the aquifer to the stream the losing stream can be connected or disconnected from the underlying aquifer depending on the presence of a saturated or unsaturated zone when the water table is below the streambed saxena and singh 2021 winter et al 1998 india s geographical area is divided into 22 major and composite river basins cwc 2019 many past research projects have been executed from which clear evidence of river stream gw interaction is available in some of these basins fig 3 therefore basin wise information on interaction related processes has been discussed in this sub section 2 1 1 ganga river basin in northern india the holy river ganga originates from gangotri glaciers in the himalayas and after covering approximately 2525 km outfalls into the bay of bengal ganga river basin is amongst the largest alluvial systems that constitute about 26 2 of india s total geographical area and form enormous multi aquifer gw reservoirs with a depth of more than 2000 m maheswaran et al 2016 surinaidu et al 2016 this entire basin is a prominent interaction site between gw and sw maheswaran et al 2016 in the central part of the tarai region in uttarakhand due to excessive gw abstraction by the year 2011 the initial gw level of 0 2 meters below ground level mbgl had changed to 4 6 mbgl during the monsoon season which enabled recharge from the stream water kumar et al 2019 however the level remained unchanged thereafter even when the abstraction activity was extended over the non monsoon season because few shallow streams had disappeared to compensate for the depleting water table dash et al 2015 and sharma et al 2014 reported that infiltrated sw directly influences gw in the upper ganga basin at haridwar srinagar and satpuli due to which production wells along the river banks were used to abstract the mixture of river and gw thus over exploitation of aquifers adjacent to the river has converted ganga s upper stretch into losing streams at various places maheswaran et al 2016 when river ganga enters the plains from the mountains middle segment of ganga e g in the haridwar narora sector of uttar pradesh up gw mainly contributes 28 60 of the river flow during the non monsoon months ala eldin et al 2000 navada and rao 1991 in the central ganga plain between moradabad and budaun districts ganga and mahawa rivers and their tributaries tikta bagad mahawa and bardmar receive a gw effluence of 34x106 m3 year that is responsible for their perennial flow ala eldin et al 2000 however during monsoon months at balawali and hastinapur stations and within the gangeswari gawan reach river ganga becomes influent due to a rise in the stage and gw abstraction recharge imbalance specifically in the budaun district an exceptionally high concentration of arsenic as i e 173 parts per billion ppb has been found in the hand pumps nearby ganga river whose concentration is diluted in the monsoon when compared with the post monsoon season tiwari et al 2016 the availability of as in shallow gw is due to multiple reasons including arsenopyrite present in the river s headwaters beyond this region river ganga while flowing through varanasi in eastern up receives 30 and 25 baseflow contribution during pre monsoon dry season and post monsoon periods respectively whereas in the peak monsoon season flow reversal takes place and aquifers get recharged from the river das et al 2021a most of the shallow aquifers in urban areas get water from river ganga and its tributaries varuna and assi while in the semi urban and rural areas local irrigational canals and ponds are responsible for their recharge das et al 2021b however unsupervised abstraction in the nearby areas resulted in the migration of contaminants such as pesticides pathogens and nitrate from these tributaries to the deeper aquifers via local vertical flow pathways das et al 2021a b it suggested that gw sw interaction governs a major chunk of the aquifer storage and gw quality here downstream of varanasi the lower segment of the river ganga passes through the as affected areas cgwb 2021a here the hydrogeochemical analysis revealed the existence of a subsurface as hotspot close to the river 5 1 259 5 ppb in ghazipur up kumar et al 2010a and in the vicinity of floodplains 87 118 ppb of ganga and its tributary koshi river in bhagalpur bihar kumar et al 2010b thus it signifies a losing stream condition in this region when ganga enters its final course to form a delta it bifurcates near farakka town to form two major distributaries the padma joining the brahmaputra in bangladesh and the bhagirathi hooghly flowing southward via west bengal and ultimately joining the bay of bengal through the largest fluvial deltaic system sundarbans in murshidabad and kolkata districts gw gets recharged from the ganga and the bhagirathi hooghly rivers along with minimal inflow from jalangi and ichamati rivers mukherjee et al 2007 from kolkata the bhagirathi hooghly river then enters the delta region in south 24 parganas district where it contributes 35 41 at 115 mbgl and more than 50 at 333 mbgl depth as gw recharge thus signifying the tidal induced gw sw interaction in the coastal area das and mukherjee 2019 within the bhagirathi and others ganga lower sub basin chakraborty and sikdar 2009 found that kalindri river water a tributary of the mahananda river and gw in the southwestern part of north bengal plain have similar isotopic composition and river receives contributions from gw further downstream remesan et al 2021 studied the gosaba island of sundarbans delta in south 24 parganas and they observed an inflow from tidal rivers gumor and datta into gw during both monsoon and non monsoon seasons the average flux value was simulated as 554 7 m3 day and 554 8 m3 day for the pre and post monsoon seasons however there was a possibility that the river water inflow could result in salinity build up in the topmost layer of the aquifer during the pre monsoon season hence they provided a scenario analysis for installing artificial drains to eliminate water logging and salinity problems from the deltaic island other than ganga its principal tributaries also uphold the phenomenon of gw and sw mixing however limited information is available regarding them table 3 only the river yamuna has been extensively studied however no studies are available for other major rivers such as kosi ghaghara son and mahananda which are also known to sustain the large human population therefore a detailed investigation is required for these water bodies 2 1 2 brahmaputra river basin river brahmaputra is another massive transboundary river that originates from the himalayas and its basin covers areas of tibet china bhutan india and bangladesh cwc 2019 within india the basin is spread over the five northeastern states and the west bengal in the dimapur district of nagaland two of its tributaries i e rivers chathe and dhansiri resulted in moderately to extremely high concentrations of fe 20 mg l and mn 0 1 mg l in the shallow aquifers by virtue of their influent nature kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 their upstream areas lie in the tectonically active area of the assam arakan basin which has large hydrocarbon deposits organic matter in these deposits was mainly responsible for a high concentration of such trace metals 2 1 3 subernarekha river basin the subernarekha river basin extends over three states and contains two major river systems subernarekha and burhabalang cwc 2019 these two rivers have been found to add 508 78 mm3 of recharge to the aquifer system in the balasore district of odisha sethi et al 2002 as a result the conjunctive use of river water and gw was suggested to the state agencies and farmers to avoid further gw depletion in the area 2 1 4 brahmani and baitarni river basin the brahmani and baitarni river basin is distributed among three states with 66 82 of the area in odisha and the remaining area in jharkhand and chhattisgarh cwc 2019 the basin has a total geographical area of 53 902 km2 and 35 65 bcm of water availability in the inland areas of the basin such as the 48 km long bolani gomlai reach of the brahmani river sub basin odisha sahoo and sahoo 2020 and sahoo and sahoo 2019 simulated the river aquifer system for a period of 3 years 1994 1996 and noticed that the river is effluent 0 52 m day in the non monsoon season and influent 0 58 m day in the monsoon season of 1994 however the same river has a lower magnitude of effluent 0 32 m day and influent 0 48 m day fluxes in the non monsoon and monsoon seasons of 1995 respectively a possible reason for this decline in both flux values could be the smaller peak value of rainfall in the year 1995 in comparison to the year 1994 i e the peak value of rainfall directly controls the magnitude of the interaction flux since flooding is common in the catchment when heavy rainfall takes place either in monsoon or due to cyclonic storms wris wiki 2021 with the help of river aquifer interaction excess water can be stored in the basin aquifers which will reduce the adverse impacts of flooding on the nearby land 2 1 5 mahanadi river basin in eastern india the mahanadi river forms one of the largest river basins in terms of drainage area 1 44 905 km2 and its entire catchment lies mainly in chhattisgarh and odisha cwc 2019 in chhattisgarh s raigarh district many steel and power plants consume large amounts of coal from the nearby mines generally mining activity can alter the hydraulic gradients near the gw sw interface and should be avoided in such areas however in one of the coalfields i e gare iv 6 coal block located in the kelo river sub basin a gw effluence of 88 38 m3 day to the kelo river has been estimated which means that the hydraulic gradient of gw flow was towards the river dhakate et al 2019 therefore the continuation of the mining operation was recommended without affecting the river flow provided that a buffer zone with an embankment has to be maintained to prevent the kelo river flood waters from entering the coal block further in some areas of the mahanadi delta gw is significantly affected by the river stage rather than the rainfall for example in the kathajodi surua inter basin odisha mohanty et al 2012 found that the correlation between gw level and river stage was stronger r 0 686 to 0 891 than the rainfall especially in the downstream areas r 0 812 to 0 891 consequently losing and gaining river conditions were observed for kathajodi and surua rivers respectively during the wet season as per the authors this information is useful in ensuring sustainable gw supply for irrigation in the studied area since sw is generally absent during dry seasons and gw is mainly used for irrigation in the post monsoon season 2 1 6 godavari river basin india s second largest river godavari is a perennial river with its catchment extended into seven states cwc 2019 the basin s industrial potential is high and various water quality parameters have crossed the tolerance limits near large cities cwc and nrsc 2014a two decades back in the patancheru industrial development area in medak district nearby hyderabad city telangana gurunadha rao et al 2001 highlighted the issue of poor gw and river water quality to meet irrigational requirements heavy pumping in the alluvium of the nakkavagu stream triggered the seepage from the stream to the aquifer along with a decline in the water table since this stream flows past the industrial area many industries have discharged treated and untreated effluents into the stream resulting in total dissolved solids tds concentrations of 3000 5000 mg l and 1000 3000 mg l in sw and gw respectively thus the induced stream aquifer interaction caused faster migration of industrial effluents in gw up to a lateral distance of 500 600 m from the stream in fact nakkavagu and peddavagu and pamulavagu streams acted as diffused contamination sources before their confluence with the river manjira a tributary of godavari 2 1 7 east flowing rivers between mahanadi and pennar the composite basin between mahanadi and pennar rivers comprises three river systems located between the following major rivers mahanadi and godavari godavari and krishna and krishna and pennar cwc 2019 the whole basin is spread over andhra pradesh odisha and telangana certain problems are associated with sw and gw quality in its coastal areas sw resources are affected by the fishing harbour activities at the estuary tidal water mixing and discharge of municipal sewage and industrial effluents whereas gw suffers from salinity issues cwc and nrsc 2014b particularly in andhra pradesh these problems co exist with the exhaustion of water resources during the summer months therefore intending to provide a safe drinking water supply to the rural population rao et al 2020 investigated the applicability of rbf well at the downstream areas of the varaha river saline coastal tract in visakhapatnam they delineated less saline river aquifer interaction zones at a depth of 6 19 15 1 m resistivity value 14 24 œâ m and drilled an rbf well on the river bank up to a depth of 35 mbgl further they found that water quality improved in the rbf well due to the mixing of sw and gw thus the concept of river gw interaction was effectively used to alter gw s chemical composition and provide potable water to the people 2 1 8 east flowing rivers between pennar and kanyakumari this river basin consists of two river systems the area between the pennar and cauvery rivers and the area between the cauvery river and the coastal town of kanyakumari cwc 2019 its drainage area covers four states primarily tamil nadu and 1 ut in some parts of the basin sw features provide freshwater flux to the aquifers and alter the gw chemistry for example at the common area of the palar and cheyyar river catchments in the kancheepuram district tamil nadu rajmohan and elango 2004 inferred that hydrochemical parameters ph electrical conductivity ec na ca mg k cl hc o 3 c o 3 and s o 4 of the two rivers and gw were similar during the monsoon season they suggested that both rivers substantially influenced gw chemistry and recharged aquifer in the rainy season except for the non monsoon period when the rivers turned effluent further small and large projects have either been executed or are currently under construction and the sw potential of the basin has been almost utilized cwc and nrsc 2014c however in areas around chennai city tamil nadu after the april and may months the reservoir storage declines in some of these projects and gw is extensively exploited for meeting the city s water supply and irrigation demand parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 for recharging the exhausted underlying aquifers checks dams can be built across the losing rivers in the north of the city two influent and independent seasonal october december rivers named arani and koratallai are flowing cwc and nrsc 2014c parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 therefore their interaction related data was utilized to find the right construction site for the check dams 2 1 9 west flowing rivers from tadri to kanyakumari in southwestern india the composite basin of west flowing rivers from tadri to kanyakumari is a part of three states and 1 ut cwc 2019 it comprises the following sub basins netravati and others periyar and others and varrar and others the netravati gurupur river basin in the dakshina kannada district karnataka is highly populated 2 089 649 as per the 2011 census and has significant industrial development cwc and nrsc 2014d the rivers are a vital source of drinking water in the district but only 6 of the total discharge occurred in the nethravati and gurupur rivers during the non monsoon season november july gurumurthy et al 2015 hence gw s contribution to the rivers became crucial for maintaining the water supply after the monsoon s end however in the same district a river named gowri hole showed contradictory behaviour with respect to the nethravati and gurupur rivers kumar and nagaraj 2018 simulated the gowri hole sub catchment for a period of 1 year june 2007 may 2008 and concluded that the river was effluent during the monsoon season and influent during post monsoon and summer months of the year 2008 the river aquifer exchange flux varied spatially within the river segments and temporally in the sub catchment having a magnitude of 31 3 210308 1 m3 day and 638 7 117964 2 m3 day for the gaining and losing conditions respectively 2 2 lake pond gw interaction lakes and ponds are an example of standing or slowly moving sw bodies their interaction with the surrounding aquifers is similar to rivers and streams they can receive sub surface inflow contribute outflow to the aquifers throughout their entire bed or even have both conditions at different places winter et al 1998 however it is difficult to establish the exchange flux between a lake pond and gw lambs 2004 due to subsurface geological complexity and the requirement of a detailed field methodology for appropriate characterisation of the hydro stratigraphy sundararajan and sankaran 2020 nevertheless lake seepage to gw is often a key parameter in the lake water budgets lake management requires knowledge about its surrounding watershed and the environment sundararajan et al 2012 a critical understanding of this exchange is thus essential for the conservation of surface runoff and augmentation of gw resources for subsequent recovery ghosh et al 2015a saleem and jeelani 2017 sanakaran and sundararajan 2014 lake pond gw interaction has been studied across the entire country except for its western region fig 4 in south india authors have mainly focussed on the impact of lake water interaction on gw chemistry tm et al 2017 found that sw interaction and geogenic atmospheric and anthropogenic sources governed the gw quality in the coastal panchayaths of the alappuzha district kerala where potable water supply is under threat due to over exploitation and high content of cl f and fe the interaction of gw with the brackish water of vembanad lake was confirmed by the appearance of cl facies during pre monsoon very high values of ec and tds concentration near the lake ionic ratios mg 2 ca 2 and na cl correlation between cl and so 4 2 anions r 0 70 in non monsoon season and isotopic analysis rajmohan and elango 2004 also observed the same phenomenon in the palar cheyyar interfluve region of tamil nadu where 11 chemical parameters e g ec 250 ¬µs cm were similar for lake and gw representing lake water recharge however apart from water quality the degree of interaction was also determined in the middle peninsular region of india from water level measurements and saturation indices of calcite and dolomite at a proposed uranium mining site in the yadgir district of karnataka manoj et al 2019 identified that melinakere lake on the west always recharges the aquifer but kelaginakere lake on the east allows seepage only during monsoon and receives gw flow during the dry season further in the northeast musi river basin telangana various lakes near hyderabad are polluted due to industrial waste and domestic sewage dumping into their waters sundararajan and sankaran 2020 they contribute a recharge of around 5 mm day to the aquifers sanakaran and sundararajan 2014 according to another estimate from sundararajan and sankaran 2020 the net gw recharge from six major lakes of the basin is 3500 m3 day therefore the underlying aquifers are highly vulnerable to pollution resistivity data along with high tds 1000 mg l and major ion concentrations in gw also substantiate the existence of shallow water table and lake aquifer interaction which means that gw is contaminated near these lakes especially in the downstream areas of the basin sanakaran and sundararajan 2014 sundararajan et al 2012 lake gw interaction has not been studied explicitly but collectively with the river aquifer systems in the northern plains of india most aquifers around the ganga in varanasi city are clay capped and have a hydrological connection with the river however at a distance of 8 22 km from the river sw infiltration occurs primarily through local ponds lakes and areas of discontinuous capping instead of direct surface infiltration and meteoric recharge das et al 2021b few gw samples with higher salinity or ec values 1000 1500 Œºs cm also depicted aquifer recharge from an oxbow lake in the catchment of river gandak lapworth et al 2021 in central eastern india gw recharge rates from the teliabandha lake in raipur city chhattisgarh showed a variation of 3 75 4 82 mm day with the lake water depth ranging between 2 5 and 3 36 m ghosh et al 2015a although this lake received sufficient surface runoff in the monsoon period its water could not be utilized in constructing the mar facility to replenish the city s stressed aquifers due to the presence of limestone formations beneath the lakebed further eastwards a few sw bodies near as affected aquifers in the west bengal were evaluated for their hydrological connection with gw these included ten ponds in the chakdaha block of nadia biswas et al 2014 two ponds in malda chakraborty and sikdar 2009 and one pond in east calcutta wetlands ecw situated on the east of kolkata city sikdar and sahu 2009 at all these sites the isotopic analysis established the involvement of the pond s evaporative water in the gw recharge in addition to the examples mentioned above lake gw connectivity investigations have also been performed for the following a tectonically active site in north east india kshetrimayum and hegeu 2016 a large freshwater lake of the south western coastal region sreekumari et al 2016 and artificially created lakes in central everard et al 2020 as well as in the fractured rock terrain of eastern india saha et al 2013 2 3 wetland gw interaction generally a natural depression with the outflow controlled by its temporary varying water storage marks the visualisation of a wetland rahman et al 2016 they are crucial habitats for various flora and fauna and their hydrological biological and chemical functions also benefit the human population junk et al 2013 the wetland s significance is evident from its impact on the downstream flow regimes and gw systems golden et al 2014 and its role as catchment scale buffer storage where it retains runoff during wet periods thereby attenuating the peak flows downstream heimann and krempa 2011 deep seated wetlands with an underlying isolated aquifer system such as the natural wetlands in downstream areas of the musi river basin also act as energy efficient wastewater treatment systems sonkamble et al 2019 the interaction of wetlands with gw is analogous to that of rivers and lakes i e a wetland can receive and contribute water from and towards the aquifer respectively which can happen either exclusively or simultaneously at different locations winter et al 1998 however unlike rivers and lakes wetlands may not always exist in the lower portions of the landscape and they can be present at slopes flat upland areas or along slow moving rivers moreover compared to the lakes gw and sw may not interact freely and quickly through the wetland beds and the exchange magnitude may be affected by the wetlands rooted vegetation winter et al 1998 nevertheless many researchers have recognised such types of interactions e g krause et al 2007 stated that the simulation of wetland aquifer hydrological interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional minimal investigations are available for india s wetland sites which mainly focus on gw pollution in the shallow aquifers of the ecw in the bengal basin gw recharge is composed of meteoric and wetland water sikdar and sahu 2009 where wetland seepage occurs the top aquitard layer is absent and gw pollution is common due to over pumping at the rate of 65 000 m3 day subsequently minimisation of gw sw interaction processes was recommended for the region by managing the tube well operation time and artificial wetland recharge from the roof top rainwater harvesting it would help avoid the inflow of heavy metals cd cr ni pb and cu to the kolkata s urban aquifers at two sites situated north of these wetlands in nadia a change in gw s dissolved organic carbon doc median concentration from 2 42 to 1 5 mg l and 3 21 to 1 78 mg l was observed when the sub surface depth increased biswas et al 2014 this decline in the concentration hinted at the doc export to the underlying aquifer through the wetland gw exchange thereby increasing the risk of as contamination in gw lawson et al 2013 similarly the aquifer s recharge from the floodplain wetlands of river gandak in the indo gangetic basin raised the gw ec values to 1000 1500 Œºs cm in some pockets of the wetland lapworth et al 2021 this activity increased gw salinity and rendered water unfit for consumption contrarily joshi et al 2021 found that delhi s urban wetlands were polluted by the landfill leachate contaminated gw inflow coming from the non engineered landfill sites in their vicinity high concentration of trace metals pb cd and mn was reported in their aquifer systems regarding the wetlands of national importance semwal et al 2020 observed that the aquifer system of the sukhna lake basin in chandigarh was receiving sw seepage some authors have also discussed the internationally significant wetlands ramsar sites danish et al 2020 calculated the submarine groundwater discharge sgd contribution as 20 of the total water inflow to the chilika lagoon on odisha s coast even in the harike wetland in punjab gw is free from heavy metal contamination on account of the recharge from the wetland s water singh et al 2020 however due to excessive gw pumping and intensive agricultural practice an infiltration gradient has been set up between the wetland lake and the aquifer because of which the wetland ponded area squeezed by 6 13 in 12 years all the studies as mentioned earlier have used experimental methods in contrast to this rahman et al 2016 developed a physics based model swatrw soil and water assessment tool for riparian wetland and tested it on the hakaluki haor wetland within the transboundary barak kushiyara river basin shared between north eastern india bangladesh 9 and myanmar 1 swatrw adequately modelled the hydrological interactions between rivers gw and wetlands where the aquifer seepage component represented 92 of the wetland s annual outflows this model actually worked on a robust bidirectional approach featuring darcy s law based wetland gw interaction algorithm instead of the unidirectional interaction approach of the existing soil and water assessment tool swat models 2 4 seawater gw interaction seas and oceans are saline water bodies where most terrestrial rivers seek their destination seawater and gw interact in coastal areas through seawater intrusion and sgd debnath et al 2019 seawater intrusion is the inland movement of seawater towards the freshwater coastal aquifers lenntech 2016 generally caused by natural processes like rising seawater levels significant evaporation and density driven forces and human activities such as excessive gw pumping kim et al 2017 raja et al 2021 this phenomenon modifies the gw chemistry and leads to the salinisation of freshwaters for instance during high tide in the coleroon river estuary tamil nadu gw contains ca mg c l and hc o 3 hydrochemical facies which indicate its mixing with the saline water at a point 9 km away from the coast raja et al 2021 during the covid 19 lockdown enforcement in the year 2020 the maximum values of ec and tds in gw of thoothukudi formerly tuticorin district increased from 4210 to 5687 Œºs cm and 5456 to 6520 mg l respectively owing to the absence of human activity and existence of seawater influence only selvam et al 2020 similar conditions were also identified by satheeskumar et al 2021 at the thamirabarani river delta where more than 40 of the gw samples tds 1000 mg l were affected by seawater intrusion demonstrating the unsuitability of water for drinking purposes increased saltpan activities as inferred from the samples having cl b r ratio above the standard values 288 292 were the main cause of seawater ingress in this deltaic region in the case of sundarbans region where mangrove forests control gw salinity das and mukherjee 2019 analysed the impact of seawater on the delta front aquifers at a depth of 14 25 mbgl the average gw salinity for all seasons was 30 ppt parts per trillion and the seawater constituted 63 of the gw fraction in the pre monsoon which plunged to 57 in the post monsoon period likewise at a depth of 30 50 mbgl the average salinity reduced to 18 ppt and the seawater proportion changed from 58 to 51 for deeper depths this proportion further dropped to 30 thus seawater intrusion was more prominent in the shallow aquifers since gw potential was reduced due to excessive abstraction on the other hand sgd refers to the combined subsurface seepage of terrestrial sourced fresh gw t sgd and recirculated sea marine water m sgd to the oceans at continental margins danish et al 2020 debnath et al 2019 moore 2010 these fluxes portray as a vital source of nutrients solutes and contaminants to the coastal ecosystem with their chemical isotopic composition altered along the discharge path danish et al 2020 das et al 2020 the flux exchange occurs at different scales irrespective of the fluid composition and driving forces moreover the tidal cycle and offshore distance govern the discharge composition for example at the chandipur coast odisha debnath et al 2019 discovered that t sgd and m sgd components were dominant during the low and high tides respectively in the pre monsoon phase the t sgd fraction increased to 88 for an offshore distance up to 45 m from the high tide line while the m sgd fraction lay within 97 37 for the offshore distance of 50 110 m however in the post monsoon phase t sgd share reached a maximum value of 99 up to 110 m distance and m sgd remained insignificant apart from the sgd composition das et al 2020 examined the ecohydrological response to the sgd borne nutrient flux in this coastal tract algal blooms were witnessed due to the annual discharge of 240 mm m2 day of no 3 flux into the bay of bengal i e sgd improved the biological productivity of this marine ecosystem hence accurate estimation of sgd flux is necessary for understanding the global chemical budgets of various elements however this assessment is a tedious exercise because of the non point and spatio temporal behaviour of the flux charette et al 2008 danish et al 2020 somehow tried to address this problem by presenting fixed and variable sgd composition approaches for the chilika lagoon both methods estimated the sgd flux to be around 1 5x106 m3 day which assured that the variable sgd approach is suitable for proper estimation of varying sgd fluxes only a few examples of seawater gw interaction studies have been illustrated in this article which is related to the eastern coastline for more information about other areas readers are requested to refer to table s2 in the supplementary information section 2 5 interaction in the himalayan region the indian himalayan region covering about 16 2 of india s geographical area and hosting more than 31 million people represents a highly dynamic and fragile ecosystem sensitive to global climate change and anthropogenic modifications panwar 2020 unfortunately regarding gw sw interaction studies it has been discriminated against other geographical features of india barely some information is available on the chemical composition of streams and springs irrespective of their societal importance jeelani 2005 jeelani et al 2011 which is discussed below karst topography constitutes some part of south eastern kashmir jeelani et al 2011 this valley area is a part of the indus river basin located between the lesser and greater himalayas winter et al 1998 defined the karst terrain as a landform created by the dissolution of carbonate rocks like limestone and dolomite where aquifers are structured as dual or triple porosity systems with laminar flow in fissures matrix and turbulent flow in the conduits hence water movement is quite unpredictable in such terrain at lower altitudes of the kashmir valley the stream and spring waters have similar tds content 250 mg l which is indicative of the recharge of these karst springs from the bringi liddar and adigam streams jeelani et al 2011 recently bhat and jeelani 2018 also observed that the streams in the bringi watershed contributed 337 35 and 7 5 m3 s of gw recharge during the high and low flow periods respectively even lake gw exchange was rarely evaluated in this mountain range lake nainital of uttarakhand was designated as a flow through type of sw body since sub surface water was involved in the lake s inflow and outflow processes saravana kumar et al 2001 gw contribution constituted 46 61 of the lake s annual inflow and the seepage towards the aquifer was 49 65 of the lake s annual outflow nachiappan et al 2002 indeed the lake s water replenished the unconfined aquifers that ultimately discharge into the hydraulically connected downstream springs another important tourist destination the dal lake of kashmir valley is known to be effluent in nature the aquifer supplies comprised 23 40 of the lake water budget with an annually averaged flux of 276x103 m3 day saleem and jeelani 2017 which is quite significant from the resource management point of view 3 interaction of gw with anthropogenic sw bodies human activities have always impacted water resources quantity quality and distribution including the interaction between gw and sw winter et al 1998 this impact can be described in both affirmative and negative ways for instance recharging exhausted contaminated aquifers or sw contribution to the gw system through mar methods are the positive aspects of human interference with the natural systems on the other hand any change in the quantity quality of the existing water sources caused by human induced disturbances in the connected water body is an example of a negative aspect past studies have covered both aspects in the indian context fig 5 which is described subsequently 3 1 interaction at artificial drainage sites artificial drainage is a system of man made drains built to remove excess water from the surface or sub surface specifically rootzone regions commonly the drains exhibit gw sw interaction processes especially by the open unlined drains sewage channels which pollute gw on a large scale because of their perennial nature kumar et al 2006 the najafgarh drain of delhi carrying domestic sewer and excess fertiliser input is a key example of such pollution within river yamuna s delhi segment the drain itself constitutes 60 share of the total drain discharge to the river downstream of its convergence point with the river the contaminated water of this drain and other major drains severely affects the gw chemistry kumar et al 2009 e g 10 15 times higher average po 4 3 concentration has been observed in the downstream gw sw samples when compared with the upstream samples during the pre monsoon period so 4 2 dominance in the deeper aquifers throughout post monsoon season also corroborate this observation similarly budhiya nala and gaunchi drain in faridabad haryana have resulted in high levels of f cl and so 4 2 ions in gw kumari et al 2018 on the contrary artificial drains also play a crucial role in water management in the semi arid peri urban agricultural areas of haryana delhi traversed by the same najafgarh drain baudron et al 2016 discovered that the drain created a geochemically low evolved gw region 0 7 4 ms cm in its vicinity and consistently provided significant aquifer recharge irrespective of its intermittent monsoon controlled regime consequently it acted as a hydraulic barrier to prevent the mixing of brackish 4 1 23 4 ms cm and fresh 0 5 to 2 3 ms cm gw flowing through the northern and southern parts of the area respectively in odisha s balasore district also surface drains provided 43 25 mm3 of gw recharge sethi et al 2002 recently in the gosaba islands remesan et al 2021 performed a scenario analysis to assess the drainage infrastructure s suitability in reducing saline waterlogging conditions they predicted that provision of three drains would solve the purpose and it will be accompanied by the decline of gw discharge to the river along riverbank boundaries additionally during pre monsoon river inflow to the island s gw system will be minimised from 554 7 m3 day to 463 7 m3 day while during monsoon and post monsoon seasons the river influx will be increased roughly from 180 to 225 m3 day and 105 to 290 m3 day respectively they argued that a steeper gradient from the river towards the drain within the gw system should be responsible for such kind of flux variation throughout the wet period 3 2 interaction at canal sites canals have been constructed in india to supply water from major rivers to areas with low water resource potential and cater to the living population s multiple needs like artificial drains seepage losses also occur through unlined canals but freshwater is added to the aquifers instead of stormwater runoff or sewage prime evidence of canal gw interaction is available at a rbf site in haridwar wherein pumping from production wells forced sw to flow through porous media and mix with gw dash et al 2015 the canal operation directly influenced the production wells surrounding the upper ganga canal ghosh et al 2015b within the yamuna basin the western and eastern yamuna canals were involved in the local recharge of the underlying aquifer ahmed and umar 2009 alam and umar 2013 kumar et al 2006 apart from these major canals in the basin the canal network in the kali hindon inter stream region was releasing an annual seepage of 16 26 mm3 to the aquifer due to which gw mounds were created in the area umar et al 2008 in the gandak basin the eastern main canal has helped maintain gw recharge to the shallow aquifers up to 40 mbgl in the upper and middle parts of the catchment lapworth et al 2021 however the canal leakage decreased on moving towards the lower portion of the catchment other areas where gw flow contributions from canals were identified include the martandnag karst spring area of kashmir valley jeelani et al 2011 ghaggar river basin in north western india joshi et al 2018 semi arid regions of haryana saharawat et al 2011 2009 singh et al 2006b singh et al 2006a industrial parts of faridabad kumari et al 2018 lower ganga ramganga inter basin area in 4 districts of up pradhan et al 2021 peri urban and rural areas of varanasi das et al 2021a command area of mahi right bank canal in kheda gujarat rastogi and prasad 1992 paddy dominated hirakud command area in odisha wable et al 2021 dwarka river floodplain in birbhum west bengal mondal and gupta 2015 and neighbourhood of bhangar canal in ecw sikdar and sahu 2009 canal based gw recharge depends on canal sub surface infiltration capacity the extent of the wetted perimeter and canal length ahmed and umar 2009 unlined canals significantly influence gw in a basin thereby improving agricultural productivity farmer livelihood and maintaining a high water table especially during dry periods jha et al 2009 being a simplified and cost effective approach to sustainable gw management in developed and developing nations iwmi 2002 thus recommended this technique for the western indo gangetic plain where the water table is rapidly declining due to gw over pumping 3 3 interaction at reservoir sites reservoirs created behind dams are normally suitable for mar where increased contact time between impounded water and riverbed aids the infiltration process such mar techniques are useful in conserving excess runoff during monsoon and ensuring water availability during subsequent non monsoon periods parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 the check dam constructed on the arani river flowing north of chennai added 1 3 mm3 63 of its cumulative storage of water to the aquifer storage in 8 months which raised the gw level from 1 to 3 5 m for a 2 km distance along with the lowering of major ion concentration parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 at the end of the structure s life 75 years it was even predicted that 97 5 mm3 of water would be infiltrated into the aquifer at a nominal cost of rs 1 2 per m3 thus check dam construction provided dual benefits it improved aquifer conditions and gw quality recently parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 delineated a 1 5 km stretch of the aquifer from the check dam in which a group of wells was directly under the dam s influence the impact of dam structures on gw configuration has also been studied for f rich gw sites of kaldurai village in tamil nadu karunanidhi et al 2020 different hydro projects in kerala and maharashtra kumar et al 2008 a small dam near salri village in madhya pradesh oblinger et al 2010 and a limestone terrain near owk reservoir in andhra pradesh where springs emerge from the base of the hillock abutting left flank of the gollaleru earthen dam noble and ansari 2017 however reservoir based mar is not a viable affair always in the drought prone areas of buldhana district in maharashtra keesari et al 2020 showed that the pentakli and koradi dam reservoirs were only contributing 0 5 5 and 0 9 1 of total recharge to the shallow 2 5 23 mbgl and deep 30 160 mbgl aquifers respectively a major chunk of gw recharge was provided by the irrigation return flow followed by the rainwater infiltration and gw residence time varied between 2 and 4 years which was a sign of the low water potential of the aquifer therefore other artificial recharge measures and rooftop rainwater harvesting were recommended for improving the gw potential kanke and dhurwa dam reservoirs in an urban area of jharkhand also shared a similar story saha et al 2013 further joseph et al 2021 used flow health assessment to show that the existing dam reservoirs and agricultural practices adversely affected the high and the low flows in the upper and lower son river basins respectively together with a decline in the basin gw level however if the reservoir releases are reduced to ensure minimum flows and the cropping patterns are modified then an improvement in the river s health and gw levels can be expected artificial excavations and small scale on farm reservoirs can also be considered low cost alternative mar methods to dam based reservoirs for example in the lateritic terrain of kharagpur city of west bengal the water level of three abandoned excavations had a strong correlation with gw level r 0 81 and these excavations provided a significant recharge of 1 90 2 99 cm day to the deep aquifers machiwal and jha 2016 water level correlation was high r 0 84 for the on farm reservoirs as well but their involvement in the recharge was relevant only when the area received less rainfall therefore artificial excavations turned out to be more reliable for mar in this case 4 methodology for determining the extent of gw sw interaction various techniques are available for characterising the exchange between gw and sw these include conventional methods such as hydrologic measurements isotopic and hydrochemical analysis or modern tools like geophysical methods and numerical modelling for a better understanding many people have also applied them in combination but selecting an appropriate method is governed by its suitability economy accuracy and investigation objective the following section illustrates the different techniques used in india 4 1 tracer analysis historically water tracers have been used to delineate catchments estimate gw s flow velocity and its recharge areas and discover pollution sources especially for the karst aquifers generally these tracers are classified into four categories artificial labels dyes salts particulates spores fluorescent microspheres bacteriophages natural labels microorganisms solution ions environmental isotopes and pulses natural and artificial ford and williams 2007 in india environmental isotopes stable and radioactive are most popular in interaction related studies followed by chloride ions cl and ec based tracers a significant variation in the gw and sw concentrations of them helps in identifying the interaction coluccio and morgan 2019 for instance heavier isotopes of oxygen 18 o and hydrogen 2 h or deuterium d get concentrated in the denser phase during a phase change in the hydrological cycle thereby initiating isotopic fractionation among the phases gupta and deshpande 2005 these hydrological processes provide a characteristic isotopic signature to different water sources it is represented in Œ¥ notation i e deviations with respect to international standard of known composition in parts per thousand eq 1 1 Œ¥ i n r x r s 1 1000 where rx ratio of 18o 16o or d h in the sample of water source and rs isotopic ratio of the standard Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values are calculated relative to standard mean ocean water smow or the equivalent vienna smow vsmow standard to study the extent of interaction between different water sources including precipitation a Œ¥d vs Œ¥18o plot is then drawn and these isotopic parameters are compared in a similar manner cl concentration and ec measurements of various sources are juxtaposed to determine the gw sw connectivity cl concentration is obtained using hydrochemical analysis ion chromatography or standard titration method while ec values are measured using a multi parameter probe or conductivity meter heat tracers are another type of tracer in which the streambed temperature profiles are used for obtaining exchange fluxes from the analytical solution of the 1d steady state heat diffusion advection equation kumar et al 2009 naganna et al 2017 the main advantage of the isotopic method is that it enhances the understanding of the hydrological processes occurring within a system stable isotopes of o and h are integral parts of water molecules making them ideal tracers for tracking water movement however while performing isotopic analysis the available isotopic data and ground based and airborne meteorological data are often insufficient for quantitatively describing the interactions among different hydrological cycle components das and mukherjee 2019 gupta and deshpande 2005 cl method is cost effective showing zero loss during evaporation and overall reduced uncertainty in the results hence it is also known as a conservative tracer nachiappan et al 2002 however if the concentration difference between two sources is small then its applicability is restricted for the heat tracer method the unavailability of sw and gw temperature data has undermined its relevance in front of darcy s flux estimation approach sahoo and sahoo 2019 o and h isotopic analysis is commonly applied in gw sw interaction investigations das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a dhakate et al 2019 gupta and deshpande 2005 lambs 2004 mukherjee et al 2007 navada and rao 1991 parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 stable isotopes of carbon 13 c are also used sometimes along with 18 o and 2 h for understanding the role of carbonate dissolution in gw chemistry tiwari et al 2016 for estimating sgd in coastal areas strontium isotopes 87 s r 86 s r are generally preferred danish et al 2020 in addition to stable isotopes many researchers also use radioactive isotopes such as tritium 3 h bhat and jeelani 2018 chakraborty and sikdar 2009 keesari et al 2020 sikdar and sahu 2009 umar et al 2008 besides environmental isotopes cl tracer has also been extensively applied in quantifying meteoric water composition in gw chemistry inferring geochemical processes and delineating regions affected by irrigation return flow bhat and jeelani 2018 das et al 2021a debnath et al 2019 gurumurthy et al 2015 keesari et al 2020 kumar et al 2006 nachiappan et al 2002 parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 in fact satheeskumar et al 2021 used the chloride bromide ratio cl br to define the seawater intrusion other than conservative tracers compounds like chlorofluorocarbon c f c 11 12 and sulphur hexafluoride s f 6 have been employed as gw residence time tracers for determining the characteristics of gw recharge lapworth et al 2021 the ec data has also been adopted as a tracer in a few studies das et al 2021a gurumurthy et al 2015 parimalarenganayaki et al 2019 parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 however no study is available regarding the heat tracer approach 4 2 hydrochemical analysis gw quality is affected by geochemical formations in aquifers recharging water composition ion exchange human activities and other environmental conditions avtar et al 2013 kumar et al 2010b tiwari et al 2016 despite the popularity of tracer tests researchers do not prefer them frequently for quantifying the impact of sw on gw because they are time consuming expensive and may welcome environmental and legal problems hydrochemical analysis can be considered as an alternative to the tracer techniques involving estimation of the quantities such as ph ec tds oxidation reduction potential dissolved oxygen temperature turbidity alkalinity hardness and the major ion chemistry dash et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 rao et al 2020 sharma and dutta 2020 in the major ion analysis usually concentrations of cations such as na k ca 2 mg 2 li and anions such as f cl br hco 3 co 3 2 so 4 2 no 3 po 4 3 are measured through the laboratory analysis the hydrochemical analysis is a simple rapid and relatively cost effective affair specifically information regarding the gw major ion chemistry is beneficial in finding solute sources and understanding water evolution because of water rock interaction silicate weathering and ion exchange processes jeelani et al 2011 hence such type of analysis has been applied in india to characterise the extent of gw sw exchange jeelani et al 2011 keesari et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 manoj et al 2019 parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 rajmohan and elango 2004 rao et al 2020 sharma and dutta 2020 and identifying sources responsible for gw contamination avtar et al 2013 das et al 2020 dash et al 2015 gurumurthy et al 2015 kumar et al 2006 2010b a raja et al 2021 satheeskumar et al 2021 tiwari et al 2016 4 3 multivariate statistical techniques for distinguishing between sw and gw components many authors have analysed hydrochemical and isotopic data using multivariate statistical techniques like end member mixing analysis emma principal component analysis pca tracer based hydrograph separation and factor and cluster analysis pca is a statistical scheme for reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset while retaining most of its original variance thus enabling the linear conversion of a multivariate dataset into uncorrelated variables in the descending order of variance das et al 2021b keesari et al 2020 it provides information regarding the relative contribution of individual components in altering the chemistry of a local hydrologic body selvam et al 2020 emma and hydrograph separation methods are governed by the mass conservation principle coluccio and morgan 2019 emma technique based on pca defines the end members and their relative proportions in the gw chemical composition keesari et al 2020 and develops a set of equations considering more tracers than the components on the other hand the tracer based hydrograph separation technique delivers data related to the spatiotemporal origin of streamflow components and gw discharge rates occurring between the reach and catchment scale kalbus et al 2006 factor and cluster analyses are another way of analysing the water quality data factor analysis is a numerical method of obtaining relatively significant entities among all the variables that demonstrate parameter variation or hydrochemical processes kumar et al 2006 assumptions are made regarding the present population from which samples have been selected and new variables are obtained from a linear combination of many variables kumar et al 2009 it is further sub classified as i r mode factor analysis it describes the interrelationship among the variables analysed ii q mode factor analysis it describes the interrelationships among the collected samples or objects in a dataset cluster analysis however is an investigative tool that sorts different objects into groups based on the fact that the degree of association is maximum between two objects belonging to the same group in general multivariate statistical techniques help in the simplification and reorganisation of large datasets to accomplish general data recommendations avtar et al 2013 gurumurthy et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 2010b they highlight the key parameters governing the overall chemistry between different sampling datasets and the connection between different sampling locations which would otherwise be difficult to find with only general geochemical and hydrological data however there are some disadvantages associated with these techniques pca s main problem is that interpreting the principal components is difficult and a balance between information loss and dimensionality reduction must be maintained in the case of emma unstable end member solutions and unrealistic mixing assumptions are considered the limitations for the tracer based hydrograph separation the isotopic composition of event and pre event waters is quite similar in many cases but variable in position and time kalbus et al 2006 which limits its applicability regarding factor analysis naming the factors can be tricky since multiple attributes can be highly correlated without any solid reason despite these drawbacks these statistical techniques have been used for interaction studies pca has been used by das et al 2021b gurumurthy et al 2015 keesari et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 and selvam et al 2020 emma finds application in determining gw recharge sources geochemical processes and storm runoff das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a debnath et al 2019 keesari et al 2020 nachiappan et al 2002 das et al 2021a used tracer based hydrograph separation in quantifying gw flux input to the fluvial baseflow in ganga gurumurthy et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 kumar et al 2006 kumar et al 2010a kumar et al 2010b and tm et al 2017 applied r mode factor analysis in their investigations while q mode factor analysis and cluster analysis was used only by kumar et al 2009 for displaying the control of the fluid exchange distributions at multiple scales 4 4 hydrological measurement based analysis hydrological variables discharge and hydraulic head have been extensively applied in describing the gw sw exchange s lumped value this value is obtained from water budgeting a type of mass balance approach based on eq 2 umar et al 2008 2 total inflow t o t a l o u t f l o w c h a n g e i n s y s t e m s t o r a g e here inflow represents the sum of precipitation sw and gw inflow outflow constitutes actual evapotranspiration sw and gw outflow and system storage means catchment water storage coluccio and morgan 2019 artificial catchment water level changes are also considered in it if the gw budget is considered all recharge and discharge components of an aquifer system are noted ahmed and umar 2008 dhakate et al 2019 umar et al 2008 apart from the budgeting water level fluctuations in sw and gw are also utilised for characterising the degree of their interaction since a connected aquifer system promptly responds to the recharge discharge of water with respect to time and season manoj et al 2019 the water level difference is incorporated as a hydraulic gradient into darcy s equation eq 3 which is then used to calculate gw exchange with the sw body coluccio and morgan 2019 kalbus et al 2006 3 q k a Œ¥ h Œ¥ l here q flow volume a cross sectional area perpendicular to flow direction k hydraulic conductivity Œ¥h difference in hydraulic head difference in gw levels for horizontal flow through gw sw interface or difference in gw sw levels for vertical flow through their interface and Œ¥l distance between points of hydraulic head measurement water budgets are commonly applied at river reach and catchment scales where it is assumed that any gain loss of sw is linked to the water source and subsequently the gw component can be identified and quantified coluccio and morgan 2019 kalbus et al 2006 however they are inefficient in assessing small scale interaction processes since flux estimation accuracy is constrained by the accuracy of the measurement of other components of the budget scanlon et al 2002 the scarcity of data collection mechanisms also affects their output resolution darcy s method is suitable for small scale applications with an existing network of wells however high costs will be incurred if new wells need to be installed accurate estimation of hydraulic conductivity of a large area is also a tedious job in this method the water budget method has been applied in the evaluation of lake gw interaction saleem and jeelani 2017 and gw exchange with rivers canals ahmed and umar 2008 dhakate et al 2019 umar et al 2008 and check dams parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 the water level fluctuations were more relevant than the water budget method during the monsoon period when substantial seasonal hydraulic head fluctuations were observed in rivers lakes and gw they played a significant role in defining the mode of interaction in the river aquifer systems of the ganga and the yamuna das et al 2021a kumar et al 2009 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 and in the lake aquifer system of the bhima basin in karnataka manoj et al 2019 4 5 geophysical methods geophysical exploration tools are a recent advancement in interaction studies in this approach the physical property differences in density elasticity magnetism and electrical resistivity within the earth s crust are interpreted as subsurface inhomogeneity comprising variation in lithology and water quantity and quality chahar 2014 the most common geophysical technique is the electrical resistivity or ec measurement it involves electric potential difference measurement between two electrodes in an electric field induced by two current electrodes sending direct current dc into the ground and subsequent derivation of the earth s electric properties from the obtained data the dc resistivity techniques can be field operated either in profiling lateral traversing mode to identify lateral changes and near vertical features or in sounding vertical electrical sounding ves mode to determine geoelectric horizon depths chahar 2014 sundararajan et al 2012 the ves method provides information about the thickness and depth of subsurface layers and the extent of gw exploitation in them sundararajan et al 2012 typically the dc resistivity survey and ves method produce 1d geoelectric cross sections containing the thickness and resistivities of all geoelectric units layers however when 2d and 3d cross sections are obtained using multi electrode combinations line or grid arrangement then the resistivity method is termed electrical resistivity tomography ert mclachlan et al 2017 it can detect apparent resistivity changes with depth and degree of water saturation in general multi electrode resistivity imaging tools combine sounding and profiling that complement the traditional resistivity methods in providing a detailed picture of the sub surface sundararajan et al 2012 equipment portability and rapid measurement are the key advantages of the electrical resistivity method chahar 2014 moreover sub surface resistivity data finds application in delineating silt clay zone thickness the extent of the pollution caused by contaminant concentration near gw sw connections and locations for observation well drilling sundararajan et al 2012 it is also useful in the gw flow model development since it reveals the details of aquifer geometry sundararajan and sankaran 2020 however errors can feature in the geophysical ves interpretations because of deviations from the assumptions of horizontal and isotropic sub surface layers sundararajan et al 2012 by and large these interpretations are not unique due to the principle of equivalence and suppression nevertheless the ves method has been used by parimalarenganayaki and elango 2015 and sikdar and sahu 2009 for the aquifer s geological characterisation at a check dam and a freshwater wetland site respectively das et al 2020 recently applied ert to scrutinise a coastal aquifer media s vertical to perpendicular shoreline resistivity distribution few studies have also employed a combination of ves and ert surveys to understand better the sw gw system rao et al 2020 sundararajan et al 2012 but other geophysical tools such as ground penetrating radar and seismic methods have been rarely used 4 6 direct measurement methods bag type or automated seepage meters can directly determine an area s gw discharge or recharge zones these devices work on the principle of isolation and coverage of a portion of the interaction interface through a bottomless cylinder kalbus et al 2006 this cylinder is connected to a deflated plastic bag for a bag type seepage meter when gaining conditions prevail the volume of collected water is measured and gw flux to sw is calculated if losing conditions prevail a known volume of water is added to the bag before field installation and then the infiltration rate is calculated from the volume loss in an automated seepage meter instruments are placed instead of the bag to continuously record the water flow rate through the outlet conduit automated devices provide temporal seepage variations and have the edge over conventional devices seepage meters are considered inexpensive and operationally simple however direct measurement of exchange flux is problematic in certain areas because of seawater circulation through the seepage face in coastal regions and spatiotemporal complexities in solute concentration the instrument cannot clearly identify the sources contributing to sgd debnath et al 2019 in the case of braided rivers it is less effective and difficult to apply coluccio and morgan 2019 moreover for obtaining representative flux values multi point measurements are required kalbus et al 2006 which is not an easy job in india seepage meter experiments were performed only for quantifying sgd to the bay of bengal bag type seepage meters were used in two areas chandipur s micro tidal coast in odisha das et al 2020 debnath et al 2019 2018 debnath and mukherjee 2016 and coleroon estuary in tamil nadu prakash et al 2018 however no study was available regarding the automated seepage meters 4 7 modelling in recent times modelling has emerged as a powerful tool that is simple comprehensive and economical compared to previously discussed methods it can help partially replicate the behaviour of a complex natural system and determine the parameters that govern the exchange flux generally models are categorised into mathematical and physical models anderson et al 2015 the former being mainly involved in gw sw interaction studies process based mathematical models consist of governing equations applicable to the problem domain and a set of initial and boundary conditions based on the solution method these models are further classified into analytical and numerical models all the models mentioned above are subsequently illustrated along with some unique modelling applications 4 7 1 analytical models analytical models are used to obtain a closed form solution of the differential equation that represents governing mechanism in the problem domain their applicability is limited to simple systems and they are irrelevant in most practical gw problems anderson et al 2015 since many assumptions are made that help simplify the model conditions for obtaining analytical solutions zipper et al 2022 however in the past few years their functionality has been enhanced by the involvement of irregular boundaries xian et al 2021 and multiple sources of recharge discharge liang and zhang 2012 wu and hsieh 2019 additionally minimal data expertise and computational demands have encouraged several authors to use them in interaction studies zipper et al 2022 for instance in a fully penetrating stream aquifer system aquifer hydraulic diffusivity hd ratio of aquifer s transmissivity and storage coefficient has been estimated through the laplace transform method for any variation in the stream stage mishra and jain 1999 this method followed a more straightforward approach than the conventional least squares optimisation since it automatically assigned less weight to the latter part of the aquifer s response to the boundary perturbation an explicit expression of hd has also been derived considering linearly varying stream stage singh 2003 which was subsequently modified by singh 2007 to account for the entrance head loss for a given laboratory data the modified model could identify and discard the inconsistent values and therefore it provided consistent estimates of hd at different sections further bhandari et al 2018 worked out an approximate analytical solution for the interaction between a stream and an unconfined horizontal aquifer with a recharging effect they used the variational homotopy perturbation method which solves the non linear boussinesq equation the analytically obtained water table profiles agreed with the numerically obtained profiles and hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were identified as sensitive parameters under similar conditions rai and singh 1995 framed a 2d expression for the water table profile using a finite fourier sine transform approach but assumed that the transient aquifer recharge occurred through an overlying rectangular basin instead of the adjacent stream the analytical solution was applied to a numerical example for the constant recharge rate the water table was observed to rise with time for the transient recharge rate the water table increased to a maximum height and then started declining in addition to unconfined aquifers an analytical model was also presented for a confined aquifer system which is connected with a constant piezometric head at one end and constantly rising stream water level at the other end along with continuous rainfall contribution through surface infiltration bansal and das 2009 the model s application established that the stream water rising rate and surface infiltration factors governed the net stream aquifer volumetric exchange apart from the horizontal aquifers analytical models are also available for the unconfined sloping aquifers for which eq 4 gives the governing boussinesq equation bansal 2012 chapman 1980 4 k cos 2 Œ≤ x h h x k sin Œ≤ cos Œ≤ h x r t s h t where k hydraulic conductivity h hydraulic head measured above the inclined base in a direction normal to the horizontal x axis Œ≤ slope of the aquifer base r t transient downward recharge per unit aquifer area and s specific yield considering the linearised form of the boussinesq equation the analytical solution was developed for gw hydraulic head and flow rate in a stream sloping aquifer system bansal 2012 upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 when a constant recharge was applied over this system the water table height increased and decreased with the aquifer s slope for the recharging and discharging aquifers respectively upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 however in the case of a transiently varying recharge the gw mound drifted laterally depending on the aquifer s slope bansal 2012 later studies assumed a vertical sedimentary clogging layer in between aquifer and stream to obtain analytical expressions for water head distribution discharge rate and net volumetric exchange bansal 2017 bansal et al 2016 the hydraulic resistance of this sedimentary layer affects the inflow outflow at the interaction interface hence when linearised boundary condition was considered for the system the analytical formulations could provide acceptable results only for small streambed leakance and head loss across the streambank bansal et al 2016 however when considering non linear boundary conditions the analytical formulations accurately modelled the gw sw interaction even for large values of stream stage variations and streambed leakance bansal 2017 most of the analytical solutions as mentioned above were developed for the stream aquifer systems however very few authors have extended the analytical modelling approach to other sw gw systems e g ghosh et al 2015a mentioned a semi analytical model for finding out the extent of unsteady gw recharge caused by the water level variation in a large water body such as a lake and its underlying aquifer the model performed satisfactorily since the temporal variation of the computed lake water depths was similar to the observed lake water depths with reasonable accuracy this study also ascertained the practical applicability of analytical modelling in investigating gw sw interactions 4 7 2 numerical models the choice of a suitable mathematical model is governed by the hydrogeologic complexity and field data availability ahmed and umar 2009 in certain situations where simple models are insufficient for the simulation of complex conditions it is obligatory to solve the partial differential equations numerically using digital computers often numerical models are based on the finite difference fd or finite element fe method facilitating the simulation of steady state or transient gw flow in 3d heterogeneous media with complex boundaries and a network of sources sinks anderson et al 2015 they can be used in both direct and inverse types of aquifer problems chahar 2014 and are also helpful in framing various management and policy actions related to watershed management by accepting the basin wide detailed impact scenarios as inputs kalbus et al 2006 maheswaran et al 2016 in the context of gw sw interaction computer modelling provides abundant information about real world issues ranging from local or regional scale to future projections coluccio and morgan 2019 e g it is worthwhile for achieving the optimal allocation of limited resources singh 2014a based on complexity these models can be distinguished into simple conceptual models treating gw as reservoirs where inflows outflows are specified and complex integrated models having more realistic physical coupling coluccio and morgan 2019 the interaction related models suffer from certain drawbacks as well flow differences at the start and termination of a river reach are often minor compared to the total river flow thereby constraining the accuracy of gw inflow outflow estimates ahmed and umar 2009 rushton 2007 regional average streambed thickness and hydraulic conductivities influence the flux estimates in large scale models ahmed and umar 2009 regarding hydraulic conductivity estimation for modelling it is tough to gather representative samples considering the fluvial bed anisotropy heterogeneity and geohydrological conditions and then drive into a realistic statistical and spatial interpretation based on this field and lab data naganna et al 2017 another limitation is that some of these constructed models can be data and computationally expensive to run e g balamurugan and murty bhallamudi 2016 and sahoo and sahoo 2020 while some models are unable to produce precise results due to scarcity of calibration data remesan et al 2021 in the case of popular gw models such as modflow it does not consider catchment geomorphology in the flux assessment and when streamflow is fed mainly by the baseflow its river boundary package riv also doesn t simulate the flux accurately sahoo and sahoo 2019 table 4 chronologically summarises some numerical modelling studies related to the gw sw exchange in india according to it about 50 of the studies preferred the modflow modelling code in conjunction with either riv boundary conditions or swat for the sw component modflow is a fd code that solves the governing equation of gw flow eq 5 and is commonly used in gw flow modelling 5 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z r s s h t where k xx k yy k zz hydraulic conductivity along x y and z directions respectively h hydraulic head above datum r source sink in terms of the volumetric flux per unit aquifer volume s s specific storage of the porous medium and t time the modflow based models have been able to simulate the gw sw system accurately since the r2 value in these studies was more than 0 9 with respect to the hydraulic head however at mining sites and deltaic islands this value was reduced to around 0 5 which means that these models were not so effective in modelling complex systems dhakate et al 2019 remesan et al 2021 apart from computer models other studies in table 4 have used numerical models to validate analytical expressions that were developed to study the stream aquifer exchange under different aquifer geometries and boundary conditions overall except for gurunadha rao et al 2001 roy et al 2015 dhakate et al 2019 and sundararajan and sankaran 2020 the remaining publications have included either only transient state analysis or both steady as well as transient state analysis thereby suggesting the suitability of these numerical models in gw sw interaction studies which is practically a time varying phenomenon 4 7 3 physical models physical models directly measure gw heads and flows mainly at the laboratory scale anderson et al 2015 frequently sandbox models are engaged in simulating simple aquifer systems where boundaries are scaled down and hydraulic conductivity s spatial distribution is modified chahar 2014 for example pahar and dhar 2014 performed a sandbox experiment with irregular boundary conditions to verify the results of an integrated gw sw interaction model developed for a generalised ground surface profile a novel dry zone wet zone theory formed the fundamental basis of this numerical model the numerical simulation results were well correlated with the experimental results for the rising tide but deviated slightly for the falling tide in coastal regions 4 7 4 miscellaneous applications of modelling certain studies cover special applications of gw sw interaction modelling for instance bandopadhyay et al 2018 demonstrated that shear flows caused by topographic relief and hydraulic head gradients increased the transient mixing dynamics of transported dissolved chemical species and created mixing hotspots underground analytical solutions were provided for a pulse and a front initial solute distribution inferences from this study can help understand the effect of hydraulic head gradients on mixing processes at the gw sw interface kumar and pahar 2020 also constructed a 2d depth averaged continuum framework for simulating the gw sw exchange the generalised hyperbolic framework is free of ad hoc coupling and the model is potentially applicable to vertical sloping interface conditions and different time scales 5 application of gw sw interaction concept the concept of gw sw interaction is involved in various water resources development and management programs some of these conceptual applications are discussed below 5 1 conjunctive use of gw and sw in irrigated agriculture the agriculture sector holds a major stake in the indian economy however rising stress on gw and sw sources in quantity and quality has diverted the scientific community s attention towards conjunctive water use in this integrated approach gw and sw are collectively utilised to improve the water supply for agriculture especially in canal irrigated areas where interactions between them are pretty significant kumar et al 2013 singh 2014a singh 2014b such practices are advantageous in dealing with water shortages increasing overall crop production and water use efficiency reclaiming waterlogged lands by increasing gw extraction utilising poor quality water along with fresh water and disposing off effluent from sub surface drainage systems singh 2014b a well managed conjunctive use system provides better output than an individual source for example underground water storage through leaky dams check dams injection wells or aquifer storage recovery wells is preferred over surface storage owing to fewer losses in them singh 2014b wrachien and fasso 2002 however the non applicability of the conjunctive use approach may lead to a demand supply imbalance thereby causing deterioration of the canal irrigation system kumar et al 2013 conjunctive water can be applied either in a cyclic manner canal water followed by saline water naresh et al 1993 or through freshwater blending with poor quality water before field application the former approach being preferred singh 2014b the most common technique for managing conjunctive water systems is simulation optimisation so modelling so models are integrated in two ways singh 2014a a embedding approach in linear programming lp based models discretised flow equations are accounted as constraints and the simulation model forms a part of the optimisation model however its application is limited to small scale steady state problems due to high computational costs and numerical difficulties peralta et al 1995 b response matrix approach here discretised flow equations are computed separately and the response matrix is incorporated into the model using the superposition principle so models are structured tools to achieve a balance between gw withdrawal and sw exhaustion barlow et al 2003 and they can account for complex water allocation problems singh 2014a various types of so models have been used in india e g lp based models mohan and jothiprakash 2003 singh and panda 2013 tyagi and narayana 1981 vedula et al 2005 non linear programming models gupta et al 1987 chance constrained lp models lakshminarayana and rajagopalan 1977 maji and heady 1978 mishra 1975 artificial neural networks based models rao et al 2004 and genetic algorithm based models raju and kumar 2004 however so models require recurring simulations of the state variables while carrying out optimisation leading to a computationally expensive approach for conjunctive water use ghosh and kashyap 2012 their integration is complex and computations may take a long time to produce an optimal solution singh 2014a ghosh and kashyap 2012 provided an alternative to so models in which approximate and computationally inexpensive linked kernel optimisation models were developed to obtain near optimal solutions towards cropping and associated gw pumping pattern in the hindon yamuna interbasin the solution was further fine tuned using physically based simulators here the kernel function describes the system s response typically water table fluctuations towards a unit impulse pulse of the input e g gw pumping maddock 1972 under dynamic equilibrium the kernels are planned with respect to crop areas versus state variables maximum water table depth and stream aquifer interflow relations however the additional computational cost is also incurred when simulations are run for generating kernel models 5 2 water resources development and management researchers are now focusing on integrated water resource development and management strategy with the rise in complex environmental problems in the hydrological cycle the connection between gw and sw components has helped sort out various water related issues in developing countries especially sustainable gw management in india has been implemented through cost effective and straightforward sw based recharge techniques for instance percolation tanks ponds and abandoned dug wells have been used to recharge shallow unconfined aquifer systems in alluvial and hard rock terrains jha et al 2009 reddy 2012 samra et al 2002 under the andhra pradesh farmer managed groundwater systems apfamgs project water harvesting measures like injection wells and abandoned open wells have been taken up for transferring flood flows into over exploited aquifers apfamgs 2006 reddy 2012 canal irrigation has also been instrumental in recharging aquifers since canal flows strongly influence the gw levels goel and jain 2006 in the command area of srisailam right branch canal in andhra pradesh gw recharge and water levels increased during the post project period and if an optimum level of canal supplies is adopted then up to 48 of allocated canal water could be saved which can be reallocated elsewhere in the irrigated area kumar et al 2013 unfortunately the linkage between surface and sub surface water also has far reaching environmental consequences especially for communities directly dependent on gw the interaction governs the level of resource exploitation beyond which these communities would face negative externalities reddy 2012 in general studies have considered gw sw interaction in water resource management through different models or a nationwide watershed development wsd policy ratha and agrawal 2014 developed an integrated systems mathematical model to define the structure of a water resources development and management system based on graph theoretic and matrix models and facilitate optimum decision making using strengths weaknesses opportunities threats swot analysis it was superior to the system analysis approaches e g lp for decision making since the model considered interaction among the water resource management system s sub systems including gw and sw development sub systems consequently the model was applied to a gw development sub system in patiala punjab to improve gw s quality and quantity the wsd policy for india has also improved the understanding of natural resources management although it intends to upgrade the livelihoods of rural communities through increased sustainable production syme et al 2012 its implementation has some challenges since the hydrological scale determines the extent of gw sw interaction most of the wsd policy execution has been done at the micro scale 500 ha which may not lead to optimal hydrological economic and equity outcomes therefore syme et al 2012 suggested adopting four watershed levels basin sub basin meso and micro in india and as per the requirement the best scale or level needs to be chosen keeping transaction costs of scale modification in mind birner and wittmer 2004 further indian gw management policies in the past were regulation centric rather than focussing on empowering the communities relying on gw for their daily livelihoods lack of accurate and reliable data complex scientific analysis for actual users provision of gw development incentives in sensitive regions and generic recommendations on gw sw linkages instead of location specific remedies have led to the failure of these policies reddy 2012 therefore reddy 2012 recommended a framework termed reduce resource evaluation estimation distribution location users communication execution to achieve sustainable gw management at the community level it bridges the gap between a resource its estimation and distribution and the user by stressing communication and execution of relevant scientific information such approaches can improve wsd policy s relevance for the general public 6 discussion and recommendations 6 1 challenges faced in the interaction studies after a deep understanding of the different aspects of gw sw interaction learning about the common problems encountered in evaluating such processes is necessary as per the literature mentioned above different natural systems pose different challenges in interaction studies complex hydrodynamic conditions exist at the river channel confluences with irregular boundaries including separation of flow and formation of a shear layer and flow stagnation zone lambs 2004 consequently identifying the contributing waters using isotopic data is often problematic if they have a similar origin in the case of lake water budgets gw recharge discharge cannot be accurately measured due to subsurface geological complexity and the requirement of detailed field methodology for suitable hydro stratigraphic characterisation sundararajan and sankaran 2020 moreover lake gw interactions may have uncertainties due to data shortages or human and instrumental errors saleem and jeelani 2017 sgd quantification is also challenging because of the spatial and temporal complexities of the heterogeneous aquifer structure das et al 2020 debnath et al 2019 in situ monitoring can be performed for relatively small sites to assess wetland hydraulic interactions with other water sources while hydrological or hydraulic modelling is preferred for large scale studies rahman et al 2016 however hydrometric time series of storage area and depth are not frequently available for wetland modelling studies data collection in a mountainous region such as the himalayas is often tedious because of natural disasters and unprecedented weather changes which can cause interruptions and rapidly modify the existing site conditions besides natural systems anthropogenic activities like mining operations can form additional ponds in an area and cause sw diversion or changes in gw sw interaction stream alignment and water quality kay et al 2006 manoj et al 2019 concerning the application part of the interaction phenomenon the conjunctive use approach has gained significance over time in india s agricultural development however excessive use of bad quality water in poorly drained soils can render salinity build up in them singh 2014a the applicability of so conjunctive use models in practical works is also undermined due to their large data requirements complexity and model parameters kumar et al 2013 in the case of water resource development management activity the practical applicability of the available system models wsd policies is constrained by the accuracy of data acquisition techniques and the data s size and quality even the resource estimates are accompanied by various scale issues reddy 2012 moreover implementing environmental management policies mainly depends on the political administration s will das et al 2021b therefore to overcome these challenges extensive data collection and new techniques are required so that proper assessment of the interaction processes is possible with minimum scope for errors 6 2 critical analysis of gw sw interaction from a national perspective india faces water stressed conditions table 1 despite having a vast water resource potential of 1999 bcm and an average annual precipitation of 3880 bcm cwc 2022 significant progress has been made in the water related infrastructure development through the completion of many projects of the major river basins which provide a total live storage capacity of 257 812 bcm cwc 2021 however for several reasons the availability of both sw and gw in uncontaminated form is still at risk literature shows that information pertaining to gw sw interaction has been very helpful in dealing with the water security issues of different regions in the country fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 in north india the indo gangetic plains are drained by the perennial himalayan rivers and mainly river aquifer systems have been investigated especially in up and uttarakhand additionally an extensive canal network is in place in this region mohanty et al 2012 and canal based seepage has been evaluated in the fertile areas of punjab haryana western up and border areas of up bihar however river sites in punjab and haryana and canal sites in central up have not been considered where certain areas are either susceptible to drought or have low water table conditions near highly urbanised areas of delhi many sw bodies are located but a large population still suffers from water related problems hence multiple sw bodies including drains canals wetlands and rivers have been considered for their connection with gw in the himalayan region 16 internationally significant wetlands spread over four states wetlands of india portal 2020 and some major dam reservoirs are present but except for some lakes none of them has been explored for their suitability in freshwater management saleem and jeelani 2017 similarly in northeast india 20 internationally significant wetlands exist along the course of the river brahmaputra wetlands of india portal 2020 but scarce information is available for the entire region even in the central indian states of madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh where 26 5 and 24 65 of gw assessment units respectively have been classified into over exploited critical and semi critical categories cgwb 2021a and about 50 of the rural population is getting potable water within their premises through pipe water supply cwc 2021 only five studies have been conducted which are insufficient within the peninsular region seawater gw interaction has been studied along the entire coastline to analyse chemical budgets of various elements protect aquifers from salinity exposure and understand coastal ecology yet most of the information is available for tamil nadu only apart from the coastal areas sw features in the plateau and the western and eastern ghats have also been analysed for their sub surface connection although their number is less than the available sw bodies for example in western india i e gujarat and maharashtra canal and dam sites have only been studied at four locations likewise in the five southern states excluding canals artificial drains and seawater all other sw gw systems have only been recognised at 19 sites however interestingly eastern india is the second most investigated area after the north region primarily because of poor gw quality data from 24 sites cover all types of natural and anthropogenic sw bodies here braided rivers also flow through the sundarbans deltaic region representing a complex gw sw interaction system these vital freshwater rivers are highly dynamic in nature having meandering channels wide bars and inconstant flow levels that can sustain unique ecosystems coluccio and morgan 2019 for example gw seepage towards the himalayan sourced brahmaputra jamuna river flowing through india and bangladesh helps maintain the baseflow during winter sarker et al 2014 in the bay of bengal the river also receives gw inflow moore 1997 from region wise analysis it is clear that interaction based studies have been performed on four types of physical features i e mountains plains plateaus and coastal plains however the desert and island landscapes have not been evaluated extensively in the arid areas of north western india particularly at sites near the thar desert in rajasthan people mainly depend on gw due to the lack of sw accessibility although some reservoirs lakes canals and rainfed ephemeral rivers are also present coyte et al 2019 reported that gw was contaminated due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources and the aquifers were receiving recharge from meteoric water and ambiguous sw sources therefore additional investigation is needed for this terrain in the upcoming studies likewise in the andaman and nicobar and lakshadweep group of islands a small population lives with limited water resources and hydraulic data availability gw is a major freshwater source for the people and therefore only seawater intrusion of the island aquifers has remained in the research focus banerjee et al 2012 chattopadhyay et al 2015 chattopadhyay and singh 2013 gopinath et al 2013 maury and balaji 2015 mondal et al 2009 najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 sarwade et al 2007 singh 2008 singh et al 2009 sundaresan 1993 karst topography has also received similar treatment regarding the number of available publications karst aquifers contain gw of economic interest and about 25 of the world s population relies on them for water needs ford and williams 2007 even though limestone formations potential karst aquifers cover about 2 of india s physical area chahar 2014 most of the karst related research has been restricted to the kashmir valley only since these aquifers can amplify the flow and transport mechanisms of gw sw exchange and welcome several environmental consequences it is imperative to explore them further especially in the areas where extreme climatic events cause large scale destruction from the available information various key issues related to gw sw interaction have been identified which are summarized in fig 6 natural forces e g weather changes geogenic interaction as well as human activities e g modification of sw environment or excessive gw pumping are responsible for the issues representing negative impacts of gw sw interaction particularly in the case of unsupervised gw abstraction it not only lowers the water table but also aggravates the interaction process due to which gw contamination and sw drying are initiated in addition to excessive gw withdrawal artificial contaminant sources like intensive agricultural practices improper district level sanitation systems untreated sewage and industrial wastewater disposal into sw bodies and the presence of municipal landfills or mines near the interaction site are responsible for the deterioration in the quality of interacting water bodies avtar et al 2013 dash et al 2015 dhakate et al 2019 kumar et al 2010b manoj et al 2019 tiwari et al 2016 another important outcome from the literature is that the ecological significance of gw sw interaction still lacks the cognizance of the scientific community key topics that were covered in the literature include nutrient supply related vegetation growth and sw degradation das et al 2020 singh et al 2020 sonkamble et al 2019 and maintenance of ecological flow in the river joseph et al 2021 lapworth et al 2021 sharma and dutta 2020 however the significance of riparian vegetation along the riverbanks and various in stream inhabitants has not yet been evaluated riparian vegetation influences the exchange fluxes of water and other related substances such as nutrients or doc gupta and deshpande 2005 and its information helps understand the mixing of waters and their dynamics lambs 2004 similarly many in stream inhabitants help maintain the stream s ecological health and are often affected by the changing hydrological events 6 3 key inferences regarding the available methodology as discussed in section 4 seven techniques have been broadly used in india for describing gw sw interaction by virtue of limitations and inherent uncertainties of individual techniques their combination was sometimes applied for a better understanding of the processes kalbus et al 2006 however they were used for a small area or a major river basin only and an analysis of their regional scale applicability is missing which is indeed a challenging task because of india s diverse geography hence this aspect of interaction related measurement techniques is discussed in the current section our literature review shows that according to location india s physical area can be divided into six main regions and a peninsular coastal region table s4 maximum studies in the northern region have analysed the interaction processes using hydrochemistry and hydrological measurements followed by the isotopic composition the significant distinction in the gw sw characteristics is responsible for such observations this area hosts an extensive network of perennial himalayan rivers and canals carrying large volumes of sw additionally there is immense pressure on gw in quantity and quality in certain areas due to intensive agriculture industrialization and increasing human population apart from these techniques very few sites have used multivariate statistics and basin and sub basin scale mathematical models a similar trend of methodological application was also observed for the eastern region but the isotopic analysis was preferred over hydrochemical study and island and reach scale numerical models were developed for river aquifer systems regarding the north eastern region insufficient publications have denied any generalisation about the applicability of available techniques in the western region the situation is entirely different from the northern region as a limited number of natural sw sources are present and gw is accessible at moderate to deeper levels 5 10 mbgl as per government data of april june 2021 hence mainly reservoir gw interaction has been studied through isotopic and hydrochemical analyses however water budgeting and mathematical modelling have been preferred in the neighbouring central region for rivers lakes and reservoirs for gw of the southern region although its recharge and chemical composition were primarily evaluated using hydrochemical parameters other methods such as conventional approaches numerical modelling and geophysical techniques were involved only at a limited number of sites further in india s coastal belt isotopic hydrochemical and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to understand seawater gw interaction however sgd flux was also measured using a seepage meter and resistivity methods in some cases from the above discussion it is clear that three main conventional techniques were popular among all the regions of india unfortunately modern techniques could not gain a reputation to such an extent researchers and scientists have under utilised methods such as emma which are otherwise well known for more accurate quantification of the recharge sources and supply of critical information especially in drought prone regions keesari et al 2020 likewise geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar or seismic magnetic electromagnetic methods etc have not been used for gw exploration in the past since the ambiguity in resistivity survey results is similar to other geophysical methods chahar 2014 applying several complementary geophysical approaches under an integrated exploration program would be better than a single approach for gw prospecting while developing numerical models for indian sites most authors have applied either loosely coupled models based on modflow or adopted modflow with its relevant packages these models underestimate infiltration flux in the case of disconnected rivers and neglect transitional stages between fully connected and fully disconnected river flow regimes brunner et al 2010 when the riv package is applied streambed parameters are either determined indirectly or employed as a calibration factor tripathi et al 2021 moreover such models show their inability to simulate complex geological features unsaturated aquifers steep hydraulic gradients and multiphase flow these limitations can be addressed with the help of fully coupled models such as opengeosys and hydrogeosphere they are physics based and completely describe the hydrological cycle and the connection among different processes through various spatiotemporal scales hence future studies could be performed using these advanced tools for various indian sites 6 4 government level problems and institutional framework for future studies at the government level the concept of gw sw interaction is still not appropriately recognised in the currently enforced national water policy 2012 there is no direct mention of gw sw interaction although the emphasis has been laid on the river s ecological flow saline water intrusion in coastal water bodies conjunctive use of sw gw integrated water resource management and establishment of artificial gw recharge projects ministry of jal shakti 2012 in 2016 two legislative bills were drafted for the national water framework and gw conservation protection regulation management which mentioned gw sw interaction in principle but did not discuss the procedure and techniques for its characterization ministry of jal shakti 2016a ministry of jal shakti 2016b further in a few publicly available documents issued by the water sector governmental organisations only a particular aspect of interaction has been covered for example cgwb 2015 and wenninger 2020 were related to the application of numerical modelling and stable isotopic analysis respectively while cgwb 2021b was focused on artificial gw recharge structures furthermore no national level standards have been laid down for the appraisal of gw sw interaction through various available techniques e g guidelines regarding parameter selection for hydrochemical analysis are unavailable even in the recent assessment of nationwide dynamic gw resources based on the water balance approach fig 2 there is a flaw in the method of gw recharge estimation from non rainfall sources in the estimation formulas of recharge from canals tanks and ponds and water conservation structures as given in table 5 predetermined recommended values of recharge seepage factor have been used in the absence of field or scientific studies which may not present an accurate picture of gw recharge moreover to some extent only baseflow contribution to streams and seawater gw connection has been considered but gw connectivity with wetlands or artificial drains has not been characterised in short a conceptual framework for conducting gw sw interaction studies is missing therefore a simple institutional framework is proposed which will provide government agencies and other stakeholders with a systematic approach to undertake comprehensive investigations for any gw sw setup fig 7 it consists of nine steps to be followed to obtain meaningful outcomes the workflow begins with identifying study objectives or key issues about the quantity and quality of water resources and related ecosystems e g the disappearance of shallow streams mar or gw contamination in the second step the whole problem is conceptualized by defining the study area and choosing the appropriate scale of investigation regional geography and other location specific characteristics are also considered then the interacting water sources are listed based on the observations and existing hydrological maps multiple sw sources natural or anthropogenic could be connected to the underlying aquifer system in a particular area e g rivers and seawater in coastal tracts rivers and canals in alluvial plains with a spatially and temporally varying transition zone at their place of connection this zone can alter the exchangeable water s ecological flow and biogeochemical conditions and is constituted of the gw sw interface hyporheic zone and ecohydrological interface conant et al 2019 unfortunately as per our knowledge this conceptual zone has not been considered in india s context therefore the transition zone will play a significant role in analysing gw sw interaction in the upcoming studies after defining the water sources data pertaining to general and specific characteristics of the gw sw system is collected it includes climate hydrological hydrogeological watershed and chemical characteristics external stresses e g anthropogenic factors recharge and discharge sources and biological parameters based on this information the relevant methodology is selected from the bunch of available techniques for which the government must finalise the parameters and guidelines in future a combination of techniques is preferred over their individual application since it will provide more confidence in the experimental outcomes subsequently assumptions are made to simplify analysis and fulfil missing parameters gw sw system is then evaluated and results are analysed using various statistical and graphical tools e g resistivity images piper trilinear plots Œ¥d vs Œ¥18o plots hydrographs from this analysis the impacts of gw sw interaction on the environment and human life are determined quantitatively the impacts can be visible in the form of increased baseflow contributions during the dry season or the rise of water table near unlined canals while qualitatively these impacts can be witnessed through gw contamination from wastewater discharge into sw or sw contamination arising from agricultural return flows that infiltrate into the soil local ecology is also affected by the interaction processes for instance unsupervised gw abstraction at the river s proximity can reduce the population of endangered aquatic species because of ecological flow reduction hence considering this information regional management strategies are prepared these include establishing riparian areas buffer strips land use and water resources management or wastewater treatment and discharge policy subsequently the strategies are incorporated into a legal policy structure whose effective implementation will be ensured by the local administration in this policy the role of each stakeholder government non governmental organisations affected communities shall be fixed and a periodic feedback mechanism will also be in place that will improve the policy provisions from time to time as per the requirement overall the entire institutional framework will provide a comprehensive solution to the problems associated with gw sw interaction processes 7 conclusion the management of gw and sw resources is incomplete without knowing the interaction between them this phenomenon is governed by numerous factors and has far reaching consequences on both environment and humanity in a vast and geographically diverse country like india significant inequality is witnessed between the availability and demand of water because of the swiftly growing population anthropogenic implications and limited resource availability therefore awareness of the countrywide water source interaction based research is required to tackle this inequality this article presented an organised account of the previous works on gw sw interaction processes in indian waters most of the past publications focussed on two key issues unsupervised gw abstraction and the presence of contamination sources near a water body moreover the commonly evaluated gw sw systems had rivers streams canals or seawater as their sw components however most of the studies were site specific without providing a generalised perspective and in many cases the interaction was not considered in totality for example only streams and lakes have been evaluated in the himalayan region similarly only 9 out of 22 major and composite river basins have been investigated for river aquifer interaction with prime emphasis on the ganga basin on a regional scale india s western and central regions were under evaluated certain critical sites have also remained unreported in the literature these include dam reservoirs and wetlands in the himalayas eco sensitive areas in north eastern india sgd sites at islands and desertic and karstic terrains thus all such regions should be inspected in future to estimate the extent of interaction regarding the available methodology for evaluating the interaction conventional techniques such as isotopic hydrochemical and hydrological analyses were more popular than modern techniques like geophysical methods multivariate statistical techniques and numerical modelling however many problems associated with the use of conventional techniques were identified such as the unavailability of a sufficient quantity of isotopic meteorological and hydrologic data experimental cost environmental and legal problems and inefficiency in the assessment of small scale interaction processes modern techniques also had certain drawbacks such as consideration of unstable end member solutions and unrealistic mixing assumptions while using emma errors in the geophysical interpretations due to their non uniqueness and computational and data collection expenses of numerical models in the case of complex gw sw systems yet they were still considered better than the conventional techniques because of equipment portability rapid measurement and ability to describe the interaction processes completely the concept of interaction also needs more recognition at the government level currently in various governmental reports very few details are available for the interaction mechanism and primarily baseflow addition to streams and seawater gw interaction to some extent have been considered additionally no national level guidelines have been issued for selecting the appropriate methodology and there is a flaw in the estimation procedure of gw recharge from non rainfall sources therefore a general institutional framework is proposed beginning from the identification of objectives to the implementation of management policies it allows various stakeholders to undertake detailed investigations for any gw sw setup overall in indian conditions gw sw interaction is essential in any water management plan hence newer data collection and analysis methods should be preferred in the upcoming projects remote sensing methods like airborne thermal infrared imaging and advanced geophysical techniques like ground penetrating radar or airborne electromagnetic survey can be used they enable the collection of large scale data and information from inaccessible areas in terms of modelling fully coupled or integrated models rely on a more significant number of model parameters than the loosely coupled models and hence they are recommended for analysing complicated gw sw setups multivariate statistical techniques should also be given priority for analysing large hydrochemical datasets and deducing meaningful results broadly speaking a single method may not provide complete confidence in the analysis results and therefore multiple methods should be applied for each specific problem to minimize the uncertainties involved in complex water systems it will be helpful in the effective resolution of

1861,this study evaluated the bias in rainfall over southeast asia in the historical simulations of the sixth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 using 48 cmip6 models a suite of evaluation methods was applied to examine in detail annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability for this study multi source observational datasets were employed for comparisons against model simulations the biases in the climatological state were decomposed into ensemble biases and the leading modes of inter model uncertainty the cmip6 models could simulate well the climatological state of meridional march and annual mean with high pattern correlation coefficients of 0 88 and 0 59 respectively however the performance is poor in simulating the long term trend that exhibits a correlation coefficient of 0 05 between simulation and observation in spatial patterns the cmip6 models could only reproduce about 23 of interannual variability this evaluation not only revealed the systematic biases in 48 cmip6 models but also illustrated the biases in the different empirical orthogonal function eof modes of inter model uncertainty and the relative performance ranking for a particular model based on the total performance index the best 3 models are ec earth3 ec earth3 veg e3sm 1 0 and relatively poor performance were seen in inm cm4 8 awi esm 1 1 lr and mcm ua 1 0 the study provides an assessment of the overall uncertainties in cmip6 models in the historical simulations and could also be a useful feedback to the global climate modellers in optimizing the models for better performance keywords southeast asia rainfall inter model uncertainty long term trend interannual variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction southeast asia consists of mainland southeast asia cambodia laos myanmar thailand and vietnam and maritime southeast asia brunei east timor indonesia malaysia philippines and singapore which has a complex terrain with many islands loo et al 2015 southeast asia has approximately 660 million people and is one of the most densely populated regions in the world as southeast asia is located in the intersection area of the asian australian monsoon it is one of the regions with the largest rainfall in the globe which is affected greatly by the asymmetric monsoon transition chang et al 2005 the rainfall simulations over southeast asia by the global models were analysed in the previous studies raghavan et al 2018 pointed out that the global models have high uncertainties to reproduce the observed climatology of rainfall over southeast asia iqbal et al 2021 evaluated the main rainfall characteristics in mainland southeast asia with multiple metrics some studies also investigated the precipitation extremes over southeast asia yao et al 2010 cheong et al 2018 ferrett et al 2019 using the long term observed data of rainfall singh and qin 2020 revealed that the variability and extremity of rainfall were enhanced and the wet days were increasing in most regions of southeast asia during the historical period 1951 2014 with the state of the art global climate models and earth system models the sixth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 aims to address the issue of climate simulation in the past and future eyring et al 2016 to investigate the regional climate by using the cmip6 models the rainfall was evaluated in terms of the historical simulation performance in different regions of the world the investigation from iqbal et al 2021 indicates that most of cmip6 models are able to reproduce the climatological state of rainfall over mainland southeast asia based on the cmip6 highresmip ajibola et al 2020 documented that the models reproduced the rainfall pattern over west africa the spatial and temporal rainfall variability over north africa in the historical simulations of cmip6 was also assessed by babaousmail et al 2021 the model inm cm5 in cmip6 had about 8 enhancement in the simulations of rainfall in south korea in comparison to cmip5 song et al 2021 most of the previous studies of multi model evaluation focus on the similarity of climatological patterns and ignore the bias structures across the inter model spread the inter model empirical orthogonal function eof is helpful to extract the main signal across the inter model spread in the analysis using multiple models zhou et al 2020 used the inter model eof method to bias correct the projection for the changes in east asian summer monsoon rainfall liu et al 2022 revealed the inter model eof modes of precipitation bias associated with the moisture cycle over southeast asia in different seasons because the climate simulation does not exhibit time correspondence among models and observations it is hard to evaluate the model performance in terms of interannual variability the previous study used the standard deviation of multiple years to denote the intensity of interannual variability and compared the similarity of spatial patterns between models and observation raghavan et al 2018 given the physical procedure of regional climate this simple metric does not reflect the main features of interannual variability the model with a high pattern similarity of standard deviation does not mean it has the ability to reproduce the leading variability of observation on the interannual time scale the leading modes derived from the interannual eof analysis of multiple years are more reasonable to analyze interannual variability in the evaluation of regional climate based on the interannual eof analysis of observation this study designed a novel method to quantify the reproduced ability of the cmip6 models in each leading mode of interannual variability of observation besides this way is better than the comparison of the eof patterns derived from the models and observation respectively raghavan et al 2018 most of the previous research has focused on the climatological state while the long term trend and the interannual variability have seldomly been discussed ajibola et al 2020 iqbal et al 2021 kusumastuti et al 2021 2022 pointed out that the climate model simulation has systematic bias not only in trend magnitude and variability which can be observed and corrected in time frequency domain correcting for systematic biases in the climate simulations was applied across a range of timescales or in the frequency domain mehrotra and sharma 2015 nguyen et al 2016 to recommend good models for regional climate modelling we give a comprehensive evaluation including 4 main timescales of annual cycle long term climatology long term trend and interannual variability this study designed a suite of evaluation methods to understand the systematic biases and the inter model uncertainty in rainfall over southeast asia 15 s 30 n 90 e 130 e using the cmip6 historical model simulations the mathematical methods are introduced in section 2 2 including pattern correlation ensemble analysis empirical orthogonal function eof analysis and decomposition of multi model biases section 2 3 elaborates how to evaluate the climatological state of annual cycle and long term climatology the long term trend and the interannual variability this paper is aimed at addressing i in terms of climatological state how well do the cmip6 models simulate the meridional march and annual mean and what are their main modes of inter model uncertainty ii can the cmip6 models reproduce the spatial pattern of long term trend and the leading modes of interannual variability the paper also design the performance index for inter model ranking based on such examinations whose calculation method is explained in section 2 4 the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the datasets and methodology section 3 illustrates the ensemble bias and the inter model uncertainty in terms of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability as well as an inter model comparison based on a few performance indices section 4 provides some discussions followed by conclusions 2 datasets and methodology 2 1 observed and cmip6 data the study area is southeast asia 15 s 30 n 90 e 130 e and the period of evaluation is from 1979 to 2014 we used 9 multi source datasets of observed rainfall over southeast asia table 1 lists the information of these observed datasets including name resolution spatial coverage time period reference and access link monthly mean rainfall was calculated and each dataset was remapped to 1 1 grids using bilinear interpolation the available datasets are used to calculate the ensemble average to generate the observational reference covering the period of 1979 2014 and the spatial grids of land and ocean in this study 48 cmip6 models were evaluated see table 2 the websites of https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 and https es doc org cmip6 models provide detailed information on the cmip6 models eyring et al 2016 the monthly precipitation of the first available realization member of each model was downloaded from the website https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 and interpolated onto 1 1 grids to suit comparisons with observations 2 2 mathematical methods 2 2 1 pattern correlation correlation coefficient is defined as 1 cor 1 n i 1 n x i x r i r œÉ x œÉ r where x is test samples simulation r is reference samples observation œÉ denotes standard deviation n is sample number and overbar denotes mean when regarding spatial grid values as samples pattern correlation coefficient cor is used to measure the similarity of spatial pattern between simulations and observations the model with higher pattern correlation coefficient means it simulates a better similarity of spatial pattern to observations and ranks better than the other models in conduct the inter model comparison 2 2 2 ensemble analysis mean and standard deviation are calculated among the multi model ensemble members which define ensemble average and ensemble standard deviation respectively to assess the common biases the ensemble bias is derived from the ensemble average of the biases of 48 cmip6 models against observations to measure the intensity of inter model uncertainty the ensemble standard deviation among 48 cmip6 models is used to denote the width of inter model spread in this study the ensemble bias and inter model uncertainty are used in the spatial evaluation of annual meridional march annual climatology and the long term trend 2 2 3 empirical orthogonal function eof analysis as a technology of dimensionality reduction eof analysis is used to decompose the multidimensional field into orthogonal basic functions which are determined by the data itself empirically hannachi et al 2007 which is defined as 2 x s t k 1 m v k s c k t where x is zero centralized multidimensional field v is empirical orthogonal function eof c is principal component coefficient pc v is also the eigenvector obtained from eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of x in calculation algorithm c k t is equals to the inner product x s t v k t s which means the contribution of the analysis filed projected onto the eigenvector at the specified mode k and sample t when extracting the leading component for geological data the empirical orthogonal function v is usually called as spatial modes and expressed as eof the indexes of s t and k refer to space sample and mode respectively m is number of modes contained in the field as usual the first 4 leading modes are often considered as hypothesized signals which is assumed as significantly correlated across original variables hannachi et al 2007 wang et al 2015 the variance percentages explained by the i eof mode are defined as the ratio of the variance of v k s c k t to the total variance of x s t therefore only the first 4 leading modes remains in this study then the rest of modes is regarded as residuals in the eof expansion hannachi et al 2007 wang et al 2015 if regarding 36 years as sample the interannual eof analysis eq 2 is used to get the leading modes of interannual variability for the observations among multiple years liu and duan 2017 the interannual eof for analysis the interannual variability of observations will serve as the baseline for model evaluation if regarding 48 models as sample the inter model eof analysis eq 2 is used to extract the leading modes of inter model biases across the cmip6 model spread mean when assessing the inter model uncertainty against observations wu et al 2020 2 2 4 decomposition of multi model biases systematic bias in the cmip6 models presented in this paper is defined as the common biases of multiple models in historical simulations including the bias of ensemble average of 48 models and the leading inter model modes of uncertainty across the inter model spread to evaluate the systematic bias of cmip6 models this study designed a novel method to decompose the multi model biases by using ensemble average and inter model eof analysis which are mentioned in section 2 2 2 and section 2 2 3 respectively for each model the climatology bias is derived from model minus observation respectively after vectorization of the spatial grids of the climatology bias the biases of 48 models are merged into the matrix of spatial grid numbers by 48 models bias the ensemble bias ens is the average of the biases of 48 models the biases of inter model spread bias ens are decomposed by using the eof expansion eq 2 to derive the 4 leading modes of inter model uncertainty and the residuals res which is expressed by 3 bias e n s k 1 4 eo f k p c k r e s where the subscript index k represents the order number of eof mode eo f k is the spatial vector of bias mode denoting the systematic bias tendency across the inter model spread and p c k is the corresponding principal components pc coefficient which reflects the bias magnitude of each model projected onto this mode relative to the ensemble bias the residuals res 4 res b i a s e n s k 1 4 eo f k p c k are not regarded as the systematic biases which do not exist in most of cmip6 models and can be ignored for each model the positive pc means the bias tendency is the same as the eof pattern while the bias tendency with the negative pc is opposite to the eof pattern therefore the bias field of a particular model i can be decomposed into the ensemble bias ens and the sum of the reconstructed components of the leading 4 modes which can be expressed as 5 bias i e n s k 1 4 eo f k p c k i the advantage of the inter model eof for the model bias is that it can clearly denote the ensemble bias of 48 models ens extract the principle modes of inter model uncertainty eof and use the principal components pc coefficient to distinguish the performance of models projected onto these extracted inter model eof modes 2 3 methods of rainfall evaluation 2 3 1 climatological state the climatological state of rainfall over southeast asia is derived from the 36 years mean of 1979 2014 this study involves two aspects of assessment of climatological state annual cycle and long term climatology because during the annual cycle the rainfall over southeast asia mainly shows meridional march moving to the north and south after the zonal average of 90 130 e of rainfall the analysis on the annual cycle focus on the evolution of meridional distribution along the 12 months besides the evaluation for long term climatology focus on the longitude latitude spatial pattern after the annual mean is calculated the analysis methods include observations ensemble average of models ensemble bias inter model uncertainty denoted by ensemble standard deviation the leading modes and principal components of inter model uncertainty derived from the inter model eof and ranking the spatial similarity of simulations to observations by using pattern correlation coefficient eq 1 2 3 2 long term trend to examine the simulated ability in the historical simulations in terms of long term trend we used the linear regression coefficient of years slope in time to describe the spatial distribution of the long term trend for each grid over southeast asia the regression coefficient is derived from the linear regression of the annual mean of rainfall against the multiple years 1979 2014 the analysis aspects includes observations ensemble average of models ensemble bias inter model uncertainty denoted by ensemble standard deviation and ranking the spatial similarity of simulations to observations by using pattern correlation coefficient eq 1 2 3 3 interannual variability as the evolution of the climate system simulated by a coupled climate model does not agree with the observations in time an actual comparison on time series between the observations and the historical simulations would not be appropriate in terms of interannual variability therefore the interannual eof analysis is used for the observations among multiple years to get the leading modes of interannual variability liu and duan 2017 thereby this study evaluates the cmip6 models through examining their ability to reproduce the leading modes of interannual variability from observations which can be reflected in the variance of the corresponding principal components coefficient the processing steps of the cmip6 model evaluation of interannual variability of rainfall over southeast asia are as follows step 1 to evaluate the interannual variability of the annual mean of rainfall the annual mean rainfall every year is calculated for both observations and cmip6 simulations step 2 the component of interannual variability of rainfall x iv in eq 6 is obtained from observations and cmip6 simulations with the climatological state and the long term linear trend removed step 3 for observations the interannual eof analysis mentioned in section 2 2 3 is used for the observations among 36 years to get the 4 leading modes eo f k obs of interannual variability which is expressed according to eq 2 as 6 x obs k 1 4 eo f k obs p c k obs r e s obs step 4 the pc coefficients of the i model p c k i are obtained by projecting the component of interannual variability of rainfall of the i model y i onto the k eigenvector derived from the interannual eof analysis in observations eo f k obs 7 p c k i y i eo f k obs t step 5 the reconstructed component of the k mode of the i model r c k i is the product of the observed eigenvectors eo f k obs and the pc coefficients of the i model p c k i 8 r c k i e o f k obs p c k i step 6 for a specified i model the variance percentage explained by the k eof mode v p k i equals to the variance of the reconstructed component over the total variance 9 v p k i v a r r c k i v a r y i 100 where var denotes the variance of field step 7 for observations the variance percentage explained by the k eof mode v p k obs can be derived from the observed eof calculation 10 v p k obs v a r eo f k obs p c k obs x obs 100 step 8 thereby the ratio of the i model s variance percentage v p k i to the observed variance percentage v p k obs is defined as the metric to quantify the reproduced ability of interannual variability on a specified eof mode k 11 r k i v p k obs v p k i step 9 the total ratio of variance percentage tr i derived from the sum of the leading 4 modes is used to measure the overall performance of the i model in terms of interannual variability 12 tr i k 1 4 r k i we used the 4 leading modes of interannual variability from observed analysis to represent the main components the total ratio of variance percentage of the cmip6 models indicates how many percentage can be reproduced by the simulations 2 4 performance index for the model ranking to conduct the inter model comparison conveniently and to rank models based on their performance in 4 timescales of annual cycle long term climatology long term trend and interannual variability this study designed the total performance index to quantitatively evaluate the cmip6 models the calculation steps are as follows step 1 mean absolute error mae is defined as 13 mae 1 n i 1 n x i r i where x is test samples simulation r is reference samples observation n is sample number step 2 the normalized mean absolute error nmae is

march of the rain belt the big rainfall pattern is distributed from west to east across the region of southeast asia the zonal average of 90 130 e is used to describe the meridional distribution of the rain belt due to the monsoon reversal the rain belt over southeast asia has remarkable features of meridional march chang et al 2005 raghavan et al 2018 the climatological mean state 1979 2014 of rainfall over southeast asia is calculated for each month a hovmoller diagram is used to describe the monthly and latitudinal evolution of rainfall fig 1 a c shows the bias analysis for the monthly evolution of the annual meridional march of the rain belt in comparison to the observations fig 1a the ensemble average of the cmip6 simulations fig 1b can reproduce well the overall features of the annual meridional march the rainfall occupies the northern region 7 n 30 n of southeast asia from may to october which prevails the southeast monsoon and brings a rainy season to mainland southeast asia the rainfall associated with the northeast monsoon dominates the southern region 15 s 30 n of southeast asia from november to april which mainly affects maritime southeast asia as the month progresses the rain belt shifts sharply from the south 15 s 30 n to the north 7 n 30 n in may and retreats gradually back to the south 7 n 30 n in november fig 1c shows the ensemble bias of the cmip6 models the rainfall over the southern latitudinal regions is overestimated from january to may the model ensemble produced suppressed rainfall in the north during may and enhanced in the south which implies that the onset of the northern rainfall belt is delayed the rain belt in the northern latitudinal regions from june to october shows a positive bias in the northern part and a relatively low negative bias in the southern part which indicates the models simulate the northern rain belt with a bias of southward shift in november the rain belt delays retreating to the south fig 1e shows the pattern correlations eq 1 between observations and simulations of all 48 models the pattern correlation coefficients indicate that the cmip6 models have significant correlations with the observations in terms of the annual meridional march of the rain belt the average correlation of cmip6 models is significantly high at 0 88 the model with the highest correlation is 0 94 hadgem3 gc31 ll no 24 and the lowest is 0 74 mcm ua 1 0 no 48 fig 1e to quantitatively denote the inter model uncertainty of the meridional march of rainfall in an annual cycle 48 models are used as samples to calculate the standard deviation of rainfall fig 1d displays the spatial pattern of inter model uncertainty denoted by the standard deviation among 48 models the inter model uncertainty of the southern rainfall is pronounced in the whole year and the northern rainfall from may to september also exhibits an apparent uncertainty the inter model eof analysis is conducted to reveal the leading 4 modes of inter model uncertainty for the meridional march fig 2 their variance percentages explained by the eof modes are 23 9 13 9 12 0 and 10 0 respectively the eof1 shows the northern rain belt is weak in its dominant period from june to september and overestimated in other months while the southern rain belt is overestimated in the whole year fig 2a this reflects the see saw biases between the northern and the southern rain belts the models with a positive pc1 simulated a stronger southern rain belt where the top positives are awi esm 1 1 lr no 29 inm cm4 8 no 27 and inm cm5 0 no 28 however those models with a negative pc1 produced a stronger northern rain belt where the top negatives are mcm ua 1 0 no 48 hadgem3 gc31 mm no 2 and kace 1 0 g no 25 fig 2e the eof2 denotes a northward shift of both the northern and southern rain belts which are characterized by the positive patterns in the north and the negative patterns in the south fig 2b the models with a positive pc2 simulated a northward shift of the rain belt where the top 3 models are inm cm5 0 no 28 mcm ua 1 0 no 48 and inm cm4 8 no 27 the models with a negative pc2 simulated a southward shifted rain belt where the top 3 models are cams csm1 0 no 14 mpi esm1 2 hr no 5 and mpi esm1 2 lr no 31 fig 2f the eof3 displays a similar pattern to the climatological state of the meridional march fig 1a which reflects the intensity of the overall rain belt fig 2c in the annual cycle the rain belt is enhanced in the models with a positive pc3 where the top positives are access esm1 5 no 22 access cm2 no 23 and canesm5 no 45 the rainfall is suppressed in the models with a negative pc3 where the top negatives are miroc es2l no 47 cas esm2 0 no 18 and mcm ua 1 0 no 48 fig 2g the eof4 indicates the earlier or more delayed meridional shifting of the rain belt fig 2d the rain belt shifts to the north and retreats to the south earlier in the models with a positive pc4 where the top positives are mcm ua 1 0 no 48 nesm3 no 32 and inm cm4 8 no 27 but the shifting is more delayed in the models with a negative pc4 where the top negatives are cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 cesm2 no 35 and cesm2 fv2 no 36 fig 2h 3 2 annual mean climatology of rainfall considering the spatial distribution the climatological mean state 1979 2014 of the annual mean rainfall over southeast asia is investigated in terms of bias and inter model uncertainty for observations the rainfall is pronounced in maritime southeast asia and the western and eastern coasts of mainland southeast asia as well as the western oceanic area fig 3 a as discussed earlier fig 1a b and section 3 1 the southern rainfall occurs from november to april and the northern rainfall concentrates from may to october due to the annual meridional march the rainfall in different regions is distributed over different seasons therefore in the following study we only focus on the annual mean without the seasonal analysis the ensemble average of cmip6 models shows similar features in comparison to the observations fig 3b the ensemble bias shows overestimation over the celebes sea 115 e 130 e 15 s 9 n and the southeastern slope of the tibetan plateau 90 e 105 e 26 n 30 n fig 3c it is likely that the overestimation is due to the poor representation of topography and islands in cmip6 models over this region the models show suppressed rainfall over the western oceanic area fig 3c all the models have significant correlations with the observations fig 3e with an averaged correlation coefficient of 0 59 the best model is noresm2 mm no 10 with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 and the poorest model is mcm ua 1 0 no 48 with a correlation coefficient of 0 35 the large standard deviation of 48 models in fig 3d indicate that the pronounced inter model uncertainty is distributed over maritime southeast asia and the western coast of mainland southeast asia the inter model eof calculation explained the 56 1 of the total variance for the leading 4 modes fig 4 the eof1 explains 20 3 of the total variance with spatially high positive biases in the southern latitude and high negative biases in the northern latitude fig 4a this signal is also seen in the first dominant mode when analyzing the annual marching of rainfall belt fig 2a the southern rain belt in the models with a positive pc1 simulated a stronger bias while the northern rain belt in those models with a negative pc1 produced a stronger bias the corresponding pc1 fig 4e also represents the top models in fig 2e where the top positives are awi esm 1 1 lr no 29 mpi esm 1 2 ham no 30 and inm cm5 0 no 28 the models with a negative pc1 simulate opposite patterns where the top negatives are mcm ua 1 0 no 48 hadgem3 gc31 mm no 2 and kace 1 0 g no 25 the eof2 which consists of 13 8 of the total variance shows a sharp contrast between land and ocean fig 4b the rainfall of the models with a positive pc2 is overestimated over the land and underestimated over the ocean as seen in the top 3 performers fgoals g3 no 34 ipsl cm6a lr no 33 and inm cm5 0 no 28 if the pc2 is negative the bias tendency reverses relative to the positive pc2 these are simulated in cams csm1 0 no 14 mpi esm 1 2 ham no 30 and mpi esm1 2 hr no 5 fig 4f the eof3 with 13 3 of the total variance implies the overall enhancement of rainfall over southeast asia fig 4c as the models with a positive pc3 seen in giss e2 1 h no 43 giss e2 1 g no 41 and giss e2 1 g cc no 42 the models with a negative pc3 simulate an overall underestimated rainfall shown by fgoals g3 no 34 cams csm1 0 no 14 and fgoals f3 l no 15 fig 4g in the spatial pattern of eof4 most of the mainland southeast asia displays a positive bias except for the southeastern slope of the tibetan plateau most of maritime southeast asia shows a negative bias and the surrounding oceanic area is mainly featured by a positive bias fig 4d 8 7 of the total variance is explained by eof4 this mode is possibly attributed to the complex terrain and land sea distribution the areas with complex topography have more uncertainty of precipitation among the climate models tao et al 2020 the models with a positive pc4 have the bias patterns mentioned above seen in hadgem3 gc31 mm no 2 hadgem3 gc31 ll no 24 and ukesm1 0 ll no 26 the models with a negative pc4 that have opposite patterns are giss e2 1 g no 41 giss e2 1 g cc no 42 and giss e2 1 h no 43 fig 4h 3 3 long term trend of rainfall the long term trend of rainfall of cmip6 model is evaluated by using the methods mentioned in section 2 3 2 fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of the long term trend of 48 cmip6 models with a great distinction the results indicate that 48 cmip6 models fail to simulate a consistent pattern of the long term trend over the most oceanic area the rainfall increases in some models of no 1 12 19 28 29 38 and 39 table 2 but decreases in some models of no 5 8 11 16 26 32 36 45 47 and 48 table 2 in mainland southeast asia the rainfall tends to enhance in some models of no 4 7 10 11 23 and 46 table 2 while the rainfall is suppressed gradually in some models of no 1 2 3 5 16 18 19 20 22 27 31 34 39 and 43 table 2 in maritime southeast asia the rainfall augments in the models of no 1 2 3 19 21 23 24 26 37 29 31 32 38 and 39 table 2 and declines in some models no 4 5 11 16 17 20 44 and 45 table 2 based on the observed analysis some previous studies have reported an increasing rainfall trend or more precipitation extremes in peninsular malaysia noor et al 2019 wan zin et al 2010 vietnam phuong et al 2019 thailand piman et al 2016 myanmar sein and zhi 2016 laos suzuki et al 2008 and singapore rahardjo et al 2020 the linear trend of observation estimated by this study agrees well with the previous results most regions of southeast asia display increasing trends of rainfall except the ocean surrounding indonesia fig 6 a as cited in the above analysis the long term trend indicates large uncertainty among the cmip6 models vicente serrano et al 2022 also indicated a large spread in model trend when comparing individual model trends to observations because the different trends shown by different models offset each other the ensemble average will smooth the different variability in multiple time the ensemble average result in a smaller magnitude of slope in time close to zero fig 6b which are the same in this study and other previous studies kumar et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2022 therefore the ensemble bias derived from the ensemble average of the cmip6 models minus the observations shows a similar pattern to the observations but with an opposite sign fig 6c the spatial distribution of inter model uncertainty is similar to the climatological state fig 6d possibly the intensity of rainfall increases the inter model uncertainty of the long term trend the spatial pattern of long term trend is calculated for each model fig 5 then the correlation coefficient of spatial pattern of long term trend between the model fig 5 and observation fig 6a is calculated and shown in fig 6e this pattern correlation coefficient is a metric for assessing the relative performance of individual models in terms of the long term trend the model with a high and positive pattern correlation coefficient has a good ability to reproduce a similar pattern relative to the observation overall the pattern correlation analysis shows that the cmip6 models show a poor performance in terms of the long term trend fig 6e for the pattern correlation coefficients of 48 models their average is only 0 05 about 58 28 out of 48 of the models have positive correlations with observation where only 7 models pass statistically the significant test at the 95 level of confidence about 42 of the models showed otherwise based on this metric it is found that the best model is cesm2 fv2 no 36 with a correlation coefficient of 0 405 whereas the poorest performing model is giss e2 1 h no 43 with a correlation coefficient of 0 40 3 4 interannual variability of rainfall furthermore we evaluated the 4 dominant modes of observations as shown in fig 7 a d which are derived from the interannual eof analysis in order to compare with the observations the variance percentage is estimated for each cmip6 model by the reconstructed component derived from the rainfall of the cmip6 model projected onto the observed eof patterns eq 10 for the variance percentage explained by the eof mode the difference between the models and observations reflects the deficiency in simulating the interannual variability the eof1 represents the integral enhancement over southeast asia fig 7a the similarity of spatial pattern of eof1 to observations means that this mode represents the anomalous intensifying of the rain belt relative to the climatological state as for observations the eof1 explains the highest variance of 43 0 this mode is similar to the spatial pattern of precipitation anomaly induced by the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso in the interannual timescale which is characterized by a positive negative anomaly over southeast asia in the la ni√±a el ni√±o event juneng and tangang 2005 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2020 however the highest pc1 variance cnrm cm6 1 hr no 1 among the models in fig 7e only explains 9 7 of the total variance the average of 48 models is only 6 0 this is significantly lower than the 43 0 explained variance of the observations in eof1 this implies that cmip6 models have a limited ability to reproduce the precipitation enso relationship in southeast asia the eof2 shows a triple pattern featured by the positive anomaly in the middle region 0 20 n and the noticeable negative anomaly in the southwestern region this mode indicates that the northern rain belt tends to shift to the south and the southern rain belt moves northward fig 7b for observations the eof2 can explain 17 6 of the total variance while the average of 48 models explains 5 1 variance and the best model mpi esm1 2 hr no 5 shows a 9 9 variance fig 7f in the eof3 the rainfall over maritime southeast asia is suppressed but enhanced over mainland southeast asia fig 7c for the southwestern rainfall the northern part shows a negative anomaly and the southern part displays a positive anomaly which means the rain belt moves southward the rainfall pattern along the northeast of the domain shows positive magnitude spanning across the eastern part of mainland southeast asia while the regions surrounding the philippines show negative the variance explained by the cmip6 models is 2 5 on average among the cmip6 models sam0 unicon no 11 captured the highest variance explained at 7 0 which is comparable with the 7 5 variance explained of the observations in eof3 the eof4 is featured by a negative positive negative positive pattern from southwest to northeast fig 7d the rainfall in indonesia and malaysia is enhanced while the rainfall in philippines and the eastern part of mainland southland is suppressed the variance explained by eof4 in observations is 4 2 which is so small that the residual modes are unnecessary for further analysis eof4 also explains small variance percentages in 48 models with an average of 2 7 and the best of 5 3 in ec earth3 veg no 4 fig 7h fig 7i shows the total variance percentage accumulated from the 4 leading modes the total variance percentage of observations reaches 72 4 which is adequate to represent the principal components of interannual variability the average in 48 models is 16 3 the best model cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 has an accumulated variance of 22 9 and the poorly performing model bcc csm2 mr no 13 has 7 1 the reproduced variance percentage of interannual variability is defined as the percentage ratio of simulations to observations the results show that the 48 models can only reproduce 22 5 interannual variability on average against the observations and the best model cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 can reproduce 31 6 variance 3 5 performance indices for inter model comparison to provide a quantitative evaluation for inter model comparisons the normalized mae is used to define the performance index in terms of the annual meridional march the annual climatology the long term trend and the interannual variability fig 8 the model with better performance has a smaller value of the normalized mae eq 14 which can simulate a result close to the observations the zero of normalized mae represents the ensemble average of 48 models models with negative positive normalized mae represent better poor performing models relative to the ensemble average the lowest accumulated normalized mae across all 4 aspects would indicate the best performing models if a model had negative positive values in all 4 aspects it was then classified into the good poor model group according to this criterion the good model group includes no 3 4 6 12 40 39 9 37 21 and 25 table 2 the performance of these models exceeds the ensemble average in all 4 aspects besides the poorly performing model group includes no 27 48 34 and 45 table 2 the best models are fgoals f3 l no 15 for the annual meridional march ec earth3 no 3 for the annual climatology canesm5 canoe no 46 for the long term trend and cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 for the interannual variability respectively considering all 4 aspects comprehensively the top 3 models are ec earth3 no 3 ec earth3 veg no 4 and e3sm 1 0 no 6 overall a good performing model should result in a lower negative normalized mae high correlation coefficients in the evaluation of the annual meridional march the annual climatology and the long term trend as well as a high calculated accumulated total variance explained in the interannual eof analysis of observation in evaluating the interannual variability it is found here that ec earth3 no 3 performed well across all metrics the overall pattern correlation of ec earth no 3 in the meridional march the annual climatology and the long term trend are 0 916 0 670 and 0 034 respectively additionally ec earth3 no 3 reproduced the 29 4 of the total explained variance of the interannual variability we considered ec earth3 no 3 as an example to illustrate the bias structure in the evaluation of climatological state by employing the methods and results mentioned above the pc of inter model uncertainty reflects the bias departure from the ensemble average in the corresponding eof mode in terms of the annual meridional march ec earth3 no 3 includes the ensemble bias as shown in fig 1c and the bias modes of inter model uncertainty as shown in fig 2 its pc1 and pc2 have large negative values which imply that the northern southern rain belt is enhanced suppressed and both the northern and southern rain belts tend to move southward the pc3 and pc4 are close to zero which means that ec earth3 no 3 has no obvious bias in these two bias modes in the annual climatology along with the ensemble bias fig 3c ec earth3 no 3 has negative biases in pc1 pc2 and pc3 the negative pc1 represents generally the enhanced rainfall in the northern latitude and the suppressed rainfall in the southern latitude the negative pc2 means the rainfall is overestimated over the sea but underestimated over the land the negative pc3 indicates an overall deficiency of rainfall over southeast asia despite providing performance indices for ranking cmip6 models in inter model comparisons the origin of uncertainty in global models is so complex that distinguishing their biases remains a challenging task some factors resulting in the uncertainty in climate modelling are summarized as follows essentially the performance depends on the design and configuration of the global models such as dynamic core parameterization of physical processes coupler of atmosphere and ocean schiemann et al 2014 on the other hand simulating the physical processes associated with climate variability over southeast asia is important such as the madden julian oscillation hagos et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and air sea interaction jiang and li 2018 the local processes involve the diurnal cycle kanamori et al 2018 and cloud simulation nasuno 2019 as well as the hydrologic cycle like the moisture convergence and evaporation seager et al 2010 liepert and previdi 2012 jiang et al 2020 therefore the reproduced ability of the model in these physical processes mentioned above has a great influence in the simulation performance of rainfall over southeast asia 4 summary and conclusions the present study utilized a suite of methods see section 2 2 mathematical methods and section 2 3 methods of rainfall evaluation to give a comprehensive evaluation of rainfall over southeast asia for the cmip6 models in terms of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability for climatological state a novel method based on the inter model eof was developed to decompose the model bias into the ensemble bias and the inter model modes in order to evaluate the reproduced ability of interannual variability the rainfall of cmip6 models was projected onto the leading modes derived from the interannual eof for observations these results not only revealed the systematic bias in 48 cmip6 models but also provided detailed information in their biases and assessed the performance of a particular model the main conclusions from this study are summarized as follows 1 from the evaluation of the annual meridional march the ensemble bias shows a delay of rain belt when it shifts to the north and retreats to the south on average the pattern correlation coefficient of simulations and observations is 0 88 the leading 4 modes of inter model uncertainty illustrate a feature of see saw biases of the northern and southern rain belts the northward shift of both the northern and southern rain belts the intensity of the overall rain belt the early or delayed meridional shifting of the rain belt respectively 2 in the annual climatology the ensemble bias shows an overestimation over the celebes sea and the southeastern slope of the tibetan plateau as well as an underestimation over the western ocean all the models have significant correlations with observations with an averaged correlation coefficient of 0 59 the leading 4 modes of inter model uncertainty denote see saw biases of the northern and southern rainfall the opposite bias between the land and ocean the overall enhancement of rainfall over southeast asia the possible bias attributed to the complex terrain and land sea distribution 3 long term trends are poorly represented in cmip6 models the averaged correlation coefficient is only 0 05 and only 7 models are significantly correlated with observations 4 the leading 4 modes of rainfall in terms of interannual variability derived from the observed eof analysis represent the holistic enhancement of rainfall over southeast asia the southward shifting of the northern rain belt and the northward movement of the southern rain belt the suppression over maritime southeast asia and enhancement over mainland southeast asia a negative positive negative positive pattern from southwest to northeast respectively given the interannual variability in observations the 48 models were only able to reproduce 22 5 on average and the best model of cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 reproduced 31 6 5 according to the total performance index eq 15 with a comprehensive consideration of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability the top 3 models are ec earth3 no 3 ec earth3 veg no 4 e3sm 1 0 no 6 and the poorest 3 models are inm cm4 8 no 27 awi esm 1 1 lr no 29 and mcm ua 1 0 no 48 the models in the good model group which performed better than the ensemble average in all 4 aspects include ec earth3 no 3 ec earth3 veg no 4 e3sm 1 0 no 6 taiesm1 no 12 noresm2 lm no 40 norcpm1 no 39 fio esm 2 0 no 9 cesm2 waccm no 37 miroc6 no 21 and kace 1 0 g no 25 the poor model group includes inm cm4 8 no 27 mcm ua 1 0 no 48 fgoals g3 no 34 and canesm5 no 45 while this study has provided some initial assessments of rainfall in the performance of the cmip6 models more work is needed to explore the causes of such biases and a possible paper is in continued work in this topic although rainfall is observed based on the accumulated depth unit mm because different months have a different number of days the average precipitation rate units mm day 1 defined as the ratio of rainfall depth falling per day is more suitable for evaluation to measure rainfall intensity the precipitation rate units mm day 1 is widely accepted in climatological analysis raghavan et al 2018 ajibola et al 2020 and the monthly precipitation datasets xie and arkin 1997 adler et al 2003 the results are helpful to understand the other regional climate related to precipitation such as hydrologic cycle and monsoons the comprehensive evaluation undertaken in this study has a general framework to evaluate the four timescales of annual cycle climatological state long term trend and interannual variability it is yet useful and could be applied in the cmip6 model evaluations in other regions and possibly for other climate variables if we analyze temperature using the evaluation analysis and the performance index the outcomes of physical meaning and the model ranking would be different from the outcomes when analyzing precipitation due to normalization the metrics also apply to the analysis of different variables for ranking model performance a solution for combining multiple variables is to derive the total performance index from multiple variables by using the equal weight average in addition this study also provided better guidance for the community of regional climate modeling to choose the appropriate global model for high resolution downscaling the bias evaluation in the historical simulations from this study is also helpful to understand the cmip6 projection uncertainty over southeast asia this study could feedback to the global modelling community in fine tuning the model parameters for enhanced performance and to limit

1861,this study evaluated the bias in rainfall over southeast asia in the historical simulations of the sixth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 using 48 cmip6 models a suite of evaluation methods was applied to examine in detail annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability for this study multi source observational datasets were employed for comparisons against model simulations the biases in the climatological state were decomposed into ensemble biases and the leading modes of inter model uncertainty the cmip6 models could simulate well the climatological state of meridional march and annual mean with high pattern correlation coefficients of 0 88 and 0 59 respectively however the performance is poor in simulating the long term trend that exhibits a correlation coefficient of 0 05 between simulation and observation in spatial patterns the cmip6 models could only reproduce about 23 of interannual variability this evaluation not only revealed the systematic biases in 48 cmip6 models but also illustrated the biases in the different empirical orthogonal function eof modes of inter model uncertainty and the relative performance ranking for a particular model based on the total performance index the best 3 models are ec earth3 ec earth3 veg e3sm 1 0 and relatively poor performance were seen in inm cm4 8 awi esm 1 1 lr and mcm ua 1 0 the study provides an assessment of the overall uncertainties in cmip6 models in the historical simulations and could also be a useful feedback to the global climate modellers in optimizing the models for better performance keywords southeast asia rainfall inter model uncertainty long term trend interannual variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction southeast asia consists of mainland southeast asia cambodia laos myanmar thailand and vietnam and maritime southeast asia brunei east timor indonesia malaysia philippines and singapore which has a complex terrain with many islands loo et al 2015 southeast asia has approximately 660 million people and is one of the most densely populated regions in the world as southeast asia is located in the intersection area of the asian australian monsoon it is one of the regions with the largest rainfall in the globe which is affected greatly by the asymmetric monsoon transition chang et al 2005 the rainfall simulations over southeast asia by the global models were analysed in the previous studies raghavan et al 2018 pointed out that the global models have high uncertainties to reproduce the observed climatology of rainfall over southeast asia iqbal et al 2021 evaluated the main rainfall characteristics in mainland southeast asia with multiple metrics some studies also investigated the precipitation extremes over southeast asia yao et al 2010 cheong et al 2018 ferrett et al 2019 using the long term observed data of rainfall singh and qin 2020 revealed that the variability and extremity of rainfall were enhanced and the wet days were increasing in most regions of southeast asia during the historical period 1951 2014 with the state of the art global climate models and earth system models the sixth phase of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 aims to address the issue of climate simulation in the past and future eyring et al 2016 to investigate the regional climate by using the cmip6 models the rainfall was evaluated in terms of the historical simulation performance in different regions of the world the investigation from iqbal et al 2021 indicates that most of cmip6 models are able to reproduce the climatological state of rainfall over mainland southeast asia based on the cmip6 highresmip ajibola et al 2020 documented that the models reproduced the rainfall pattern over west africa the spatial and temporal rainfall variability over north africa in the historical simulations of cmip6 was also assessed by babaousmail et al 2021 the model inm cm5 in cmip6 had about 8 enhancement in the simulations of rainfall in south korea in comparison to cmip5 song et al 2021 most of the previous studies of multi model evaluation focus on the similarity of climatological patterns and ignore the bias structures across the inter model spread the inter model empirical orthogonal function eof is helpful to extract the main signal across the inter model spread in the analysis using multiple models zhou et al 2020 used the inter model eof method to bias correct the projection for the changes in east asian summer monsoon rainfall liu et al 2022 revealed the inter model eof modes of precipitation bias associated with the moisture cycle over southeast asia in different seasons because the climate simulation does not exhibit time correspondence among models and observations it is hard to evaluate the model performance in terms of interannual variability the previous study used the standard deviation of multiple years to denote the intensity of interannual variability and compared the similarity of spatial patterns between models and observation raghavan et al 2018 given the physical procedure of regional climate this simple metric does not reflect the main features of interannual variability the model with a high pattern similarity of standard deviation does not mean it has the ability to reproduce the leading variability of observation on the interannual time scale the leading modes derived from the interannual eof analysis of multiple years are more reasonable to analyze interannual variability in the evaluation of regional climate based on the interannual eof analysis of observation this study designed a novel method to quantify the reproduced ability of the cmip6 models in each leading mode of interannual variability of observation besides this way is better than the comparison of the eof patterns derived from the models and observation respectively raghavan et al 2018 most of the previous research has focused on the climatological state while the long term trend and the interannual variability have seldomly been discussed ajibola et al 2020 iqbal et al 2021 kusumastuti et al 2021 2022 pointed out that the climate model simulation has systematic bias not only in trend magnitude and variability which can be observed and corrected in time frequency domain correcting for systematic biases in the climate simulations was applied across a range of timescales or in the frequency domain mehrotra and sharma 2015 nguyen et al 2016 to recommend good models for regional climate modelling we give a comprehensive evaluation including 4 main timescales of annual cycle long term climatology long term trend and interannual variability this study designed a suite of evaluation methods to understand the systematic biases and the inter model uncertainty in rainfall over southeast asia 15 s 30 n 90 e 130 e using the cmip6 historical model simulations the mathematical methods are introduced in section 2 2 including pattern correlation ensemble analysis empirical orthogonal function eof analysis and decomposition of multi model biases section 2 3 elaborates how to evaluate the climatological state of annual cycle and long term climatology the long term trend and the interannual variability this paper is aimed at addressing i in terms of climatological state how well do the cmip6 models simulate the meridional march and annual mean and what are their main modes of inter model uncertainty ii can the cmip6 models reproduce the spatial pattern of long term trend and the leading modes of interannual variability the paper also design the performance index for inter model ranking based on such examinations whose calculation method is explained in section 2 4 the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the datasets and methodology section 3 illustrates the ensemble bias and the inter model uncertainty in terms of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability as well as an inter model comparison based on a few performance indices section 4 provides some discussions followed by conclusions 2 datasets and methodology 2 1 observed and cmip6 data the study area is southeast asia 15 s 30 n 90 e 130 e and the period of evaluation is from 1979 to 2014 we used 9 multi source datasets of observed rainfall over southeast asia table 1 lists the information of these observed datasets including name resolution spatial coverage time period reference and access link monthly mean rainfall was calculated and each dataset was remapped to 1 1 grids using bilinear interpolation the available datasets are used to calculate the ensemble average to generate the observational reference covering the period of 1979 2014 and the spatial grids of land and ocean in this study 48 cmip6 models were evaluated see table 2 the websites of https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 and https es doc org cmip6 models provide detailed information on the cmip6 models eyring et al 2016 the monthly precipitation of the first available realization member of each model was downloaded from the website https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 and interpolated onto 1 1 grids to suit comparisons with observations 2 2 mathematical methods 2 2 1 pattern correlation correlation coefficient is defined as 1 cor 1 n i 1 n x i x r i r œÉ x œÉ r where x is test samples simulation r is reference samples observation œÉ denotes standard deviation n is sample number and overbar denotes mean when regarding spatial grid values as samples pattern correlation coefficient cor is used to measure the similarity of spatial pattern between simulations and observations the model with higher pattern correlation coefficient means it simulates a better similarity of spatial pattern to observations and ranks better than the other models in conduct the inter model comparison 2 2 2 ensemble analysis mean and standard deviation are calculated among the multi model ensemble members which define ensemble average and ensemble standard deviation respectively to assess the common biases the ensemble bias is derived from the ensemble average of the biases of 48 cmip6 models against observations to measure the intensity of inter model uncertainty the ensemble standard deviation among 48 cmip6 models is used to denote the width of inter model spread in this study the ensemble bias and inter model uncertainty are used in the spatial evaluation of annual meridional march annual climatology and the long term trend 2 2 3 empirical orthogonal function eof analysis as a technology of dimensionality reduction eof analysis is used to decompose the multidimensional field into orthogonal basic functions which are determined by the data itself empirically hannachi et al 2007 which is defined as 2 x s t k 1 m v k s c k t where x is zero centralized multidimensional field v is empirical orthogonal function eof c is principal component coefficient pc v is also the eigenvector obtained from eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of x in calculation algorithm c k t is equals to the inner product x s t v k t s which means the contribution of the analysis filed projected onto the eigenvector at the specified mode k and sample t when extracting the leading component for geological data the empirical orthogonal function v is usually called as spatial modes and expressed as eof the indexes of s t and k refer to space sample and mode respectively m is number of modes contained in the field as usual the first 4 leading modes are often considered as hypothesized signals which is assumed as significantly correlated across original variables hannachi et al 2007 wang et al 2015 the variance percentages explained by the i eof mode are defined as the ratio of the variance of v k s c k t to the total variance of x s t therefore only the first 4 leading modes remains in this study then the rest of modes is regarded as residuals in the eof expansion hannachi et al 2007 wang et al 2015 if regarding 36 years as sample the interannual eof analysis eq 2 is used to get the leading modes of interannual variability for the observations among multiple years liu and duan 2017 the interannual eof for analysis the interannual variability of observations will serve as the baseline for model evaluation if regarding 48 models as sample the inter model eof analysis eq 2 is used to extract the leading modes of inter model biases across the cmip6 model spread mean when assessing the inter model uncertainty against observations wu et al 2020 2 2 4 decomposition of multi model biases systematic bias in the cmip6 models presented in this paper is defined as the common biases of multiple models in historical simulations including the bias of ensemble average of 48 models and the leading inter model modes of uncertainty across the inter model spread to evaluate the systematic bias of cmip6 models this study designed a novel method to decompose the multi model biases by using ensemble average and inter model eof analysis which are mentioned in section 2 2 2 and section 2 2 3 respectively for each model the climatology bias is derived from model minus observation respectively after vectorization of the spatial grids of the climatology bias the biases of 48 models are merged into the matrix of spatial grid numbers by 48 models bias the ensemble bias ens is the average of the biases of 48 models the biases of inter model spread bias ens are decomposed by using the eof expansion eq 2 to derive the 4 leading modes of inter model uncertainty and the residuals res which is expressed by 3 bias e n s k 1 4 eo f k p c k r e s where the subscript index k represents the order number of eof mode eo f k is the spatial vector of bias mode denoting the systematic bias tendency across the inter model spread and p c k is the corresponding principal components pc coefficient which reflects the bias magnitude of each model projected onto this mode relative to the ensemble bias the residuals res 4 res b i a s e n s k 1 4 eo f k p c k are not regarded as the systematic biases which do not exist in most of cmip6 models and can be ignored for each model the positive pc means the bias tendency is the same as the eof pattern while the bias tendency with the negative pc is opposite to the eof pattern therefore the bias field of a particular model i can be decomposed into the ensemble bias ens and the sum of the reconstructed components of the leading 4 modes which can be expressed as 5 bias i e n s k 1 4 eo f k p c k i the advantage of the inter model eof for the model bias is that it can clearly denote the ensemble bias of 48 models ens extract the principle modes of inter model uncertainty eof and use the principal components pc coefficient to distinguish the performance of models projected onto these extracted inter model eof modes 2 3 methods of rainfall evaluation 2 3 1 climatological state the climatological state of rainfall over southeast asia is derived from the 36 years mean of 1979 2014 this study involves two aspects of assessment of climatological state annual cycle and long term climatology because during the annual cycle the rainfall over southeast asia mainly shows meridional march moving to the north and south after the zonal average of 90 130 e of rainfall the analysis on the annual cycle focus on the evolution of meridional distribution along the 12 months besides the evaluation for long term climatology focus on the longitude latitude spatial pattern after the annual mean is calculated the analysis methods include observations ensemble average of models ensemble bias inter model uncertainty denoted by ensemble standard deviation the leading modes and principal components of inter model uncertainty derived from the inter model eof and ranking the spatial similarity of simulations to observations by using pattern correlation coefficient eq 1 2 3 2 long term trend to examine the simulated ability in the historical simulations in terms of long term trend we used the linear regression coefficient of years slope in time to describe the spatial distribution of the long term trend for each grid over southeast asia the regression coefficient is derived from the linear regression of the annual mean of rainfall against the multiple years 1979 2014 the analysis aspects includes observations ensemble average of models ensemble bias inter model uncertainty denoted by ensemble standard deviation and ranking the spatial similarity of simulations to observations by using pattern correlation coefficient eq 1 2 3 3 interannual variability as the evolution of the climate system simulated by a coupled climate model does not agree with the observations in time an actual comparison on time series between the observations and the historical simulations would not be appropriate in terms of interannual variability therefore the interannual eof analysis is used for the observations among multiple years to get the leading modes of interannual variability liu and duan 2017 thereby this study evaluates the cmip6 models through examining their ability to reproduce the leading modes of interannual variability from observations which can be reflected in the variance of the corresponding principal components coefficient the processing steps of the cmip6 model evaluation of interannual variability of rainfall over southeast asia are as follows step 1 to evaluate the interannual variability of the annual mean of rainfall the annual mean rainfall every year is calculated for both observations and cmip6 simulations step 2 the component of interannual variability of rainfall x iv in eq 6 is obtained from observations and cmip6 simulations with the climatological state and the long term linear trend removed step 3 for observations the interannual eof analysis mentioned in section 2 2 3 is used for the observations among 36 years to get the 4 leading modes eo f k obs of interannual variability which is expressed according to eq 2 as 6 x obs k 1 4 eo f k obs p c k obs r e s obs step 4 the pc coefficients of the i model p c k i are obtained by projecting the component of interannual variability of rainfall of the i model y i onto the k eigenvector derived from the interannual eof analysis in observations eo f k obs 7 p c k i y i eo f k obs t step 5 the reconstructed component of the k mode of the i model r c k i is the product of the observed eigenvectors eo f k obs and the pc coefficients of the i model p c k i 8 r c k i e o f k obs p c k i step 6 for a specified i model the variance percentage explained by the k eof mode v p k i equals to the variance of the reconstructed component over the total variance 9 v p k i v a r r c k i v a r y i 100 where var denotes the variance of field step 7 for observations the variance percentage explained by the k eof mode v p k obs can be derived from the observed eof calculation 10 v p k obs v a r eo f k obs p c k obs x obs 100 step 8 thereby the ratio of the i model s variance percentage v p k i to the observed variance percentage v p k obs is defined as the metric to quantify the reproduced ability of interannual variability on a specified eof mode k 11 r k i v p k obs v p k i step 9 the total ratio of variance percentage tr i derived from the sum of the leading 4 modes is used to measure the overall performance of the i model in terms of interannual variability 12 tr i k 1 4 r k i we used the 4 leading modes of interannual variability from observed analysis to represent the main components the total ratio of variance percentage of the cmip6 models indicates how many percentage can be reproduced by the simulations 2 4 performance index for the model ranking to conduct the inter model comparison conveniently and to rank models based on their performance in 4 timescales of annual cycle long term climatology long term trend and interannual variability this study designed the total performance index to quantitatively evaluate the cmip6 models the calculation steps are as follows step 1 mean absolute error mae is defined as 13 mae 1 n i 1 n x i r i where x is test samples simulation r is reference samples observation n is sample number step 2 the normalized mean absolute error nmae is calculated as 14 nma e k ma e k avg mae std mae where of ma e k is the mae eq 11 of a particular model k avg mae denotes ensemble average of multi model mae and std mae is the ensemble standard deviation std of multi model mae step 3 for the sake of a comprehensive evaluation in 4 timescales the total performance index tpi is defined by the average of the normalized mae of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability the equation is defined as 15 tp i k 1 4 nma e k a n m a e k c n m a e k l n m a e k i where k indicates a particular model nma e k a calculates the climatological month latitude pattern for the annual meridional march nma e k c calculates the climatological spatial pattern for annual mean nma e k l calculates the spatial pattern of the linear regression coefficient for long term trend and nma e k i calculate the total ratio of variance percentage for interannual variability 3 results and discussions 3 1 annual meridional march of the rain belt the big rainfall pattern is distributed from west to east across the region of southeast asia the zonal average of 90 130 e is used to describe the meridional distribution of the rain belt due to the monsoon reversal the rain belt over southeast asia has remarkable features of meridional march chang et al 2005 raghavan et al 2018 the climatological mean state 1979 2014 of rainfall over southeast asia is calculated for each month a hovmoller diagram is used to describe the monthly and latitudinal evolution of rainfall fig 1 a c shows the bias analysis for the monthly evolution of the annual meridional march of the rain belt in comparison to the observations fig 1a the ensemble average of the cmip6 simulations fig 1b can reproduce well the overall features of the annual meridional march the rainfall occupies the northern region 7 n 30 n of southeast asia from may to october which prevails the southeast monsoon and brings a rainy season to mainland southeast asia the rainfall associated with the northeast monsoon dominates the southern region 15 s 30 n of southeast asia from november to april which mainly affects maritime southeast asia as the month progresses the rain belt shifts sharply from the south 15 s 30 n to the north 7 n 30 n in may and retreats gradually back to the south 7 n 30 n in november fig 1c shows the ensemble bias of the cmip6 models the rainfall over the southern latitudinal regions is overestimated from january to may the model ensemble produced suppressed rainfall in the north during may and enhanced in the south which implies that the onset of the northern rainfall belt is delayed the rain belt in the northern latitudinal regions from june to october shows a positive bias in the northern part and a relatively low negative bias in the southern part which indicates the models simulate the northern rain belt with a bias of southward shift in november the rain belt delays retreating to the south fig 1e shows the pattern correlations eq 1 between observations and simulations of all 48 models the pattern correlation coefficients indicate that the cmip6 models have significant correlations with the observations in terms of the annual meridional march of the rain belt the average correlation of cmip6 models is significantly high at 0 88 the model with the highest correlation is 0 94 hadgem3 gc31 ll no 24 and the lowest is 0 74 mcm ua 1 0 no 48 fig 1e to quantitatively denote the inter model uncertainty of the meridional march of rainfall in an annual cycle 48 models are used as samples to calculate the standard deviation of rainfall fig 1d displays the spatial pattern of inter model uncertainty denoted by the standard deviation among 48 models the inter model uncertainty of the southern rainfall is pronounced in the whole year and the northern rainfall from may to september also exhibits an apparent uncertainty the inter model eof analysis is conducted to reveal the leading 4 modes of inter model uncertainty for the meridional march fig 2 their variance percentages explained by the eof modes are 23 9 13 9 12 0 and 10 0 respectively the eof1 shows the northern rain belt is weak in its dominant period from june to september and overestimated in other months while the southern rain belt is overestimated in the whole year fig 2a this reflects the see saw biases between the northern and the southern rain belts the models with a positive pc1 simulated a stronger southern rain belt where the top positives are awi esm 1 1 lr no 29 inm cm4 8 no 27 and inm cm5 0 no 28 however those models with a negative pc1 produced a stronger northern rain belt where the top negatives are mcm ua 1 0 no 48 hadgem3 gc31 mm no 2 and kace 1 0 g no 25 fig 2e the eof2 denotes a northward shift of both the northern and southern rain belts which are characterized by the positive patterns in the north and the negative patterns in the south fig 2b the models with a positive pc2 simulated a northward shift of the rain belt where the top 3 models are inm cm5 0 no 28 mcm ua 1 0 no 48 and inm cm4 8 no 27 the models with a negative pc2 simulated a southward shifted rain belt where the top 3 models are cams csm1 0 no 14 mpi esm1 2 hr no 5 and mpi esm1 2 lr no 31 fig 2f the eof3 displays a similar pattern to the climatological state of the meridional march fig 1a which reflects the intensity of the overall rain belt fig 2c in the annual cycle the rain belt is enhanced in the models with a positive pc3 where the top positives are access esm1 5 no 22 access cm2 no 23 and canesm5 no 45 the rainfall is suppressed in the models with a negative pc3 where the top negatives are miroc es2l no 47 cas esm2 0 no 18 and mcm ua 1 0 no 48 fig 2g the eof4 indicates the earlier or more delayed meridional shifting of the rain belt fig 2d the rain belt shifts to the north and retreats to the south earlier in the models with a positive pc4 where the top positives are mcm ua 1 0 no 48 nesm3 no 32 and inm cm4 8 no 27 but the shifting is more delayed in the models with a negative pc4 where the top negatives are cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 cesm2 no 35 and cesm2 fv2 no 36 fig 2h 3 2 annual mean climatology of rainfall considering the spatial distribution the climatological mean state 1979 2014 of the annual mean rainfall over southeast asia is investigated in terms of bias and inter model uncertainty for observations the rainfall is pronounced in maritime southeast asia and the western and eastern coasts of mainland southeast asia as well as the western oceanic area fig 3 a as discussed earlier fig 1a b and section 3 1 the southern rainfall occurs from november to april and the northern rainfall concentrates from may to october due to the annual meridional march the rainfall in different regions is distributed over different seasons therefore in the following study we only focus on the annual mean without the seasonal analysis the ensemble average of cmip6 models shows similar features in comparison to the observations fig 3b the ensemble bias shows overestimation over the celebes sea 115 e 130 e 15 s 9 n and the southeastern slope of the tibetan plateau 90 e 105 e 26 n 30 n fig 3c it is likely that the overestimation is due to the poor representation of topography and islands in cmip6 models over this region the models show suppressed rainfall over the western oceanic area fig 3c all the models have significant correlations with the observations fig 3e with an averaged correlation coefficient of 0 59 the best model is noresm2 mm no 10 with a correlation coefficient of 0 78 and the poorest model is mcm ua 1 0 no 48 with a correlation coefficient of 0 35 the large standard deviation of 48 models in fig 3d indicate that the pronounced inter model uncertainty is distributed over maritime southeast asia and the western coast of mainland southeast asia the inter model eof calculation explained the 56 1 of the total variance for the leading 4 modes fig 4 the eof1 explains 20 3 of the total variance with spatially high positive biases in the southern latitude and high negative biases in the northern latitude fig 4a this signal is also seen in the first dominant mode when analyzing the annual marching of rainfall belt fig 2a the southern rain belt in the models with a positive pc1 simulated a stronger bias while the northern rain belt in those models with a negative pc1 produced a stronger bias the corresponding pc1 fig 4e also represents the top models in fig 2e where the top positives are awi esm 1 1 lr no 29 mpi esm 1 2 ham no 30 and inm cm5 0 no 28 the models with a negative pc1 simulate opposite patterns where the top negatives are mcm ua 1 0 no 48 hadgem3 gc31 mm no 2 and kace 1 0 g no 25 the eof2 which consists of 13 8 of the total variance shows a sharp contrast between land and ocean fig 4b the rainfall of the models with a positive pc2 is overestimated over the land and underestimated over the ocean as seen in the top 3 performers fgoals g3 no 34 ipsl cm6a lr no 33 and inm cm5 0 no 28 if the pc2 is negative the bias tendency reverses relative to the positive pc2 these are simulated in cams csm1 0 no 14 mpi esm 1 2 ham no 30 and mpi esm1 2 hr no 5 fig 4f the eof3 with 13 3 of the total variance implies the overall enhancement of rainfall over southeast asia fig 4c as the models with a positive pc3 seen in giss e2 1 h no 43 giss e2 1 g no 41 and giss e2 1 g cc no 42 the models with a negative pc3 simulate an overall underestimated rainfall shown by fgoals g3 no 34 cams csm1 0 no 14 and fgoals f3 l no 15 fig 4g in the spatial pattern of eof4 most of the mainland southeast asia displays a positive bias except for the southeastern slope of the tibetan plateau most of maritime southeast asia shows a negative bias and the surrounding oceanic area is mainly featured by a positive bias fig 4d 8 7 of the total variance is explained by eof4 this mode is possibly attributed to the complex terrain and land sea distribution the areas with complex topography have more uncertainty of precipitation among the climate models tao et al 2020 the models with a positive pc4 have the bias patterns mentioned above seen in hadgem3 gc31 mm no 2 hadgem3 gc31 ll no 24 and ukesm1 0 ll no 26 the models with a negative pc4 that have opposite patterns are giss e2 1 g no 41 giss e2 1 g cc no 42 and giss e2 1 h no 43 fig 4h 3 3 long term trend of rainfall the long term trend of rainfall of cmip6 model is evaluated by using the methods mentioned in section 2 3 2 fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of the long term trend of 48 cmip6 models with a great distinction the results indicate that 48 cmip6 models fail to simulate a consistent pattern of the long term trend over the most oceanic area the rainfall increases in some models of no 1 12 19 28 29 38 and 39 table 2 but decreases in some models of no 5 8 11 16 26 32 36 45 47 and 48 table 2 in mainland southeast asia the rainfall tends to enhance in some models of no 4 7 10 11 23 and 46 table 2 while the rainfall is suppressed gradually in some models of no 1 2 3 5 16 18 19 20 22 27 31 34 39 and 43 table 2 in maritime southeast asia the rainfall augments in the models of no 1 2 3 19 21 23 24 26 37 29 31 32 38 and 39 table 2 and declines in some models no 4 5 11 16 17 20 44 and 45 table 2 based on the observed analysis some previous studies have reported an increasing rainfall trend or more precipitation extremes in peninsular malaysia noor et al 2019 wan zin et al 2010 vietnam phuong et al 2019 thailand piman et al 2016 myanmar sein and zhi 2016 laos suzuki et al 2008 and singapore rahardjo et al 2020 the linear trend of observation estimated by this study agrees well with the previous results most regions of southeast asia display increasing trends of rainfall except the ocean surrounding indonesia fig 6 a as cited in the above analysis the long term trend indicates large uncertainty among the cmip6 models vicente serrano et al 2022 also indicated a large spread in model trend when comparing individual model trends to observations because the different trends shown by different models offset each other the ensemble average will smooth the different variability in multiple time the ensemble average result in a smaller magnitude of slope in time close to zero fig 6b which are the same in this study and other previous studies kumar et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2022 therefore the ensemble bias derived from the ensemble average of the cmip6 models minus the observations shows a similar pattern to the observations but with an opposite sign fig 6c the spatial distribution of inter model uncertainty is similar to the climatological state fig 6d possibly the intensity of rainfall increases the inter model uncertainty of the long term trend the spatial pattern of long term trend is calculated for each model fig 5 then the correlation coefficient of spatial pattern of long term trend between the model fig 5 and observation fig 6a is calculated and shown in fig 6e this pattern correlation coefficient is a metric for assessing the relative performance of individual models in terms of the long term trend the model with a high and positive pattern correlation coefficient has a good ability to reproduce a similar pattern relative to the observation overall the pattern correlation analysis shows that the cmip6 models show a poor performance in terms of the long term trend fig 6e for the pattern correlation coefficients of 48 models their average is only 0 05 about 58 28 out of 48 of the models have positive correlations with observation where only 7 models pass statistically the significant test at the 95 level of confidence about 42 of the models showed otherwise based on this metric it is found that the best model is cesm2 fv2 no 36 with a correlation coefficient of 0 405 whereas the poorest performing model is giss e2 1 h no 43 with a correlation coefficient of 0 40 3 4 interannual variability of rainfall furthermore we evaluated the 4 dominant modes of observations as shown in fig 7 a d which are derived from the interannual eof analysis in order to compare with the observations the variance percentage is estimated for each cmip6 model by the reconstructed component derived from the rainfall of the cmip6 model projected onto the observed eof patterns eq 10 for the variance percentage explained by the eof mode the difference between the models and observations reflects the deficiency in simulating the interannual variability the eof1 represents the integral enhancement over southeast asia fig 7a the similarity of spatial pattern of eof1 to observations means that this mode represents the anomalous intensifying of the rain belt relative to the climatological state as for observations the eof1 explains the highest variance of 43 0 this mode is similar to the spatial pattern of precipitation anomaly induced by the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso in the interannual timescale which is characterized by a positive negative anomaly over southeast asia in the la ni√±a el ni√±o event juneng and tangang 2005 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2020 however the highest pc1 variance cnrm cm6 1 hr no 1 among the models in fig 7e only explains 9 7 of the total variance the average of 48 models is only 6 0 this is significantly lower than the 43 0 explained variance of the observations in eof1 this implies that cmip6 models have a limited ability to reproduce the precipitation enso relationship in southeast asia the eof2 shows a triple pattern featured by the positive anomaly in the middle region 0 20 n and the noticeable negative anomaly in the southwestern region this mode indicates that the northern rain belt tends to shift to the south and the southern rain belt moves northward fig 7b for observations the eof2 can explain 17 6 of the total variance while the average of 48 models explains 5 1 variance and the best model mpi esm1 2 hr no 5 shows a 9 9 variance fig 7f in the eof3 the rainfall over maritime southeast asia is suppressed but enhanced over mainland southeast asia fig 7c for the southwestern rainfall the northern part shows a negative anomaly and the southern part displays a positive anomaly which means the rain belt moves southward the rainfall pattern along the northeast of the domain shows positive magnitude spanning across the eastern part of mainland southeast asia while the regions surrounding the philippines show negative the variance explained by the cmip6 models is 2 5 on average among the cmip6 models sam0 unicon no 11 captured the highest variance explained at 7 0 which is comparable with the 7 5 variance explained of the observations in eof3 the eof4 is featured by a negative positive negative positive pattern from southwest to northeast fig 7d the rainfall in indonesia and malaysia is enhanced while the rainfall in philippines and the eastern part of mainland southland is suppressed the variance explained by eof4 in observations is 4 2 which is so small that the residual modes are unnecessary for further analysis eof4 also explains small variance percentages in 48 models with an average of 2 7 and the best of 5 3 in ec earth3 veg no 4 fig 7h fig 7i shows the total variance percentage accumulated from the 4 leading modes the total variance percentage of observations reaches 72 4 which is adequate to represent the principal components of interannual variability the average in 48 models is 16 3 the best model cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 has an accumulated variance of 22 9 and the poorly performing model bcc csm2 mr no 13 has 7 1 the reproduced variance percentage of interannual variability is defined as the percentage ratio of simulations to observations the results show that the 48 models can only reproduce 22 5 interannual variability on average against the observations and the best model cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 can reproduce 31 6 variance 3 5 performance indices for inter model comparison to provide a quantitative evaluation for inter model comparisons the normalized mae is used to define the performance index in terms of the annual meridional march the annual climatology the long term trend and the interannual variability fig 8 the model with better performance has a smaller value of the normalized mae eq 14 which can simulate a result close to the observations the zero of normalized mae represents the ensemble average of 48 models models with negative positive normalized mae represent better poor performing models relative to the ensemble average the lowest accumulated normalized mae across all 4 aspects would indicate the best performing models if a model had negative positive values in all 4 aspects it was then classified into the good poor model group according to this criterion the good model group includes no 3 4 6 12 40 39 9 37 21 and 25 table 2 the performance of these models exceeds the ensemble average in all 4 aspects besides the poorly performing model group includes no 27 48 34 and 45 table 2 the best models are fgoals f3 l no 15 for the annual meridional march ec earth3 no 3 for the annual climatology canesm5 canoe no 46 for the long term trend and cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 for the interannual variability respectively considering all 4 aspects comprehensively the top 3 models are ec earth3 no 3 ec earth3 veg no 4 and e3sm 1 0 no 6 overall a good performing model should result in a lower negative normalized mae high correlation coefficients in the evaluation of the annual meridional march the annual climatology and the long term trend as well as a high calculated accumulated total variance explained in the interannual eof analysis of observation in evaluating the interannual variability it is found here that ec earth3 no 3 performed well across all metrics the overall pattern correlation of ec earth no 3 in the meridional march the annual climatology and the long term trend are 0 916 0 670 and 0 034 respectively additionally ec earth3 no 3 reproduced the 29 4 of the total explained variance of the interannual variability we considered ec earth3 no 3 as an example to illustrate the bias structure in the evaluation of climatological state by employing the methods and results mentioned above the pc of inter model uncertainty reflects the bias departure from the ensemble average in the corresponding eof mode in terms of the annual meridional march ec earth3 no 3 includes the ensemble bias as shown in fig 1c and the bias modes of inter model uncertainty as shown in fig 2 its pc1 and pc2 have large negative values which imply that the northern southern rain belt is enhanced suppressed and both the northern and southern rain belts tend to move southward the pc3 and pc4 are close to zero which means that ec earth3 no 3 has no obvious bias in these two bias modes in the annual climatology along with the ensemble bias fig 3c ec earth3 no 3 has negative biases in pc1 pc2 and pc3 the negative pc1 represents generally the enhanced rainfall in the northern latitude and the suppressed rainfall in the southern latitude the negative pc2 means the rainfall is overestimated over the sea but underestimated over the land the negative pc3 indicates an overall deficiency of rainfall over southeast asia despite providing performance indices for ranking cmip6 models in inter model comparisons the origin of uncertainty in global models is so complex that distinguishing their biases remains a challenging task some factors resulting in the uncertainty in climate modelling are summarized as follows essentially the performance depends on the design and configuration of the global models such as dynamic core parameterization of physical processes coupler of atmosphere and ocean schiemann et al 2014 on the other hand simulating the physical processes associated with climate variability over southeast asia is important such as the madden julian oscillation hagos et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and air sea interaction jiang and li 2018 the local processes involve the diurnal cycle kanamori et al 2018 and cloud simulation nasuno 2019 as well as the hydrologic cycle like the moisture convergence and evaporation seager et al 2010 liepert and previdi 2012 jiang et al 2020 therefore the reproduced ability of the model in these physical processes mentioned above has a great influence in the simulation performance of rainfall over southeast asia 4 summary and conclusions the present study utilized a suite of methods see section 2 2 mathematical methods and section 2 3 methods of rainfall evaluation to give a comprehensive evaluation of rainfall over southeast asia for the cmip6 models in terms of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability for climatological state a novel method based on the inter model eof was developed to decompose the model bias into the ensemble bias and the inter model modes in order to evaluate the reproduced ability of interannual variability the rainfall of cmip6 models was projected onto the leading modes derived from the interannual eof for observations these results not only revealed the systematic bias in 48 cmip6 models but also provided detailed information in their biases and assessed the performance of a particular model the main conclusions from this study are summarized as follows 1 from the evaluation of the annual meridional march the ensemble bias shows a delay of rain belt when it shifts to the north and retreats to the south on average the pattern correlation coefficient of simulations and observations is 0 88 the leading 4 modes of inter model uncertainty illustrate a feature of see saw biases of the northern and southern rain belts the northward shift of both the northern and southern rain belts the intensity of the overall rain belt the early or delayed meridional shifting of the rain belt respectively 2 in the annual climatology the ensemble bias shows an overestimation over the celebes sea and the southeastern slope of the tibetan plateau as well as an underestimation over the western ocean all the models have significant correlations with observations with an averaged correlation coefficient of 0 59 the leading 4 modes of inter model uncertainty denote see saw biases of the northern and southern rainfall the opposite bias between the land and ocean the overall enhancement of rainfall over southeast asia the possible bias attributed to the complex terrain and land sea distribution 3 long term trends are poorly represented in cmip6 models the averaged correlation coefficient is only 0 05 and only 7 models are significantly correlated with observations 4 the leading 4 modes of rainfall in terms of interannual variability derived from the observed eof analysis represent the holistic enhancement of rainfall over southeast asia the southward shifting of the northern rain belt and the northward movement of the southern rain belt the suppression over maritime southeast asia and enhancement over mainland southeast asia a negative positive negative positive pattern from southwest to northeast respectively given the interannual variability in observations the 48 models were only able to reproduce 22 5 on average and the best model of cesm2 waccm fv2 no 38 reproduced 31 6 5 according to the total performance index eq 15 with a comprehensive consideration of annual meridional march annual climatology long term trend and interannual variability the top 3 models are ec earth3 no 3 ec earth3 veg no 4 e3sm 1 0 no 6 and the poorest 3 models are inm cm4 8 no 27 awi esm 1 1 lr no 29 and mcm ua 1 0 no 48 the models in the good model group which performed better than the ensemble average in all 4 aspects include ec earth3 no 3 ec earth3 veg no 4 e3sm 1 0 no 6 taiesm1 no 12 noresm2 lm no 40 norcpm1 no 39 fio esm 2 0 no 9 cesm2 waccm no 37 miroc6 no 21 and kace 1 0 g no 25 the poor model group includes inm cm4 8 no 27 mcm ua 1 0 no 48 fgoals g3 no 34 and canesm5 no 45 while this study has provided some initial assessments of rainfall in the performance of the cmip6 models more work is needed to explore the causes of such biases and a possible paper is in continued work in this topic although rainfall is observed based on the accumulated depth unit mm because different months have a different number of days the average precipitation rate units mm day 1 defined as the ratio of rainfall depth falling per day is more suitable for evaluation to measure rainfall intensity the precipitation rate units mm day 1 is widely accepted in climatological analysis raghavan et al 2018 ajibola et al 2020 and the monthly precipitation datasets xie and arkin 1997 adler et al 2003 the results are helpful to understand the other regional climate related to precipitation such as hydrologic cycle and monsoons the comprehensive evaluation undertaken in this study has a general framework to evaluate the four timescales of annual cycle climatological state long term trend and interannual variability it is yet useful and could be applied in the cmip6 model evaluations in other regions and possibly for other climate variables if we analyze temperature using the evaluation analysis and the performance index the outcomes of physical meaning and the model ranking would be different from the outcomes when analyzing precipitation due to normalization the metrics also apply to the analysis of different variables for ranking model performance a solution for combining multiple variables is to derive the total performance index from multiple variables by using the equal weight average in addition this study also provided better guidance for the community of regional climate modeling to choose the appropriate global model for high resolution downscaling the bias evaluation in the historical simulations from this study is also helpful to understand the cmip6 projection uncertainty over southeast asia this study could feedback to the global modelling community in fine tuning the model parameters for enhanced performance and to limit

1862,calibrating a hydrological model using more than one independent data set multi objective calibration can potentially improve parameter estimation however it often identifies multiple parameter sets whose combined performance is generally indistinguishable as visualized via a pareto front the objective of this paper is to identify how pareto optimal solutions perform during model validation and to identify how objective function tradeoffs in calibration might shift along the pareto front during validation model calibration was based on an ecohydrological model simulating leaf area index lai evapotranspiration et and streamflow focusing on a predominantly forested australian catchment and using satellite derived lai and et with observed streamflow for calibration gave understanding of differences in model behavior related to observed data the performance shifts between validation and calibration periods were assessed for combinations of et and streamflow and lai and streamflow for both observed data combinations the performance deteriorated between calibration to validation and the best performing validation parameter solutions were scattered along the calibration pareto front in general the streamflow lai data pairing showed a greater deterioration in streamflow performance in validation compared to the streamflow et data pairing however in both cases there was significant parameter equifinality the results highlight that model structural limitations are a greater issue for model validation performance than in calibration the identification of one optimal parameter set from a pareto set remains elusive keywords multi objective calibration bgm hymod moscem data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction multi objective calibration of hydrological models has frequently been suggested as a way to reduce bias and uncertainty in model simulations when compared to single objective calibration dumedah et al 2012 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 franks et al 1999 and in particular to address parameter uncertainty tang et al 2018 multi objective calibration involves calibrating model parameters on two or more objective functions vrugt et al 2003 and several studies have focused on different performance indicators related to streamflow dumedah et al 2012 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 zhang et al 2018 in these studies the two competing objectives are both based on the same observed data for example bias and rmse dumedah et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 this is sometimes referred to as multi metric calibration pfannerstill et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 another multi objective approach has been to look at multiple sites within a catchment delivering a spatial multi objective or multi site calibration molina navarro et al 2017 piniewski and okruszko 2011 the final alternative is using two or more independent observed timeseries data sets for example streamflow q and leaf area index lai and therefore two truly independent objective functions in the hope of further constraining model parameters rajib et al 2016 tang et al 2018 vervoort et al 2014 in recent years many other studies have integrated satellite data with large distributed models this work using large scale and generally gridded models has built on the original work of immerzeel and droogers 2008 and immerzeel et al 2008 taking advantage of the increased spatial information in gridded satellite products to improve hydrological predictions e g kundu et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 demb√©l√© et al 2020a demb√©l√© et al 2020b and soltani et al 2021 however in many practical hydrological applications lumped conceptual models are still mainstream and therefore there is a need to develop methods and strategies to incorporate the now abundant satellite information into such models using the increased temporal information multi objective calibration in general and calibration on two observed data sets in particular can potentially improve parameterisation multi metric calibration improves parameterisation as the different metrics of a single dataset i e objective functions target different parts of the flow duration curve zhang et al 2016 two independent observed data sets in multi objective calibration provide information on different physical processes within the catchment sikorska et al 2015 vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 for example plant growth and runoff generation as a result the derived parameter sets are more likely to be reliable and robust efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 and therefore less likely to be overfitted calibration using multiple data sets can also improve model performance i e consensus between model simulations and observed data finger et al 2015 sikorska et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 however improved parameter estimations and improved simulation performance is not guaranteed vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 depending on the structure of the model the number of calibrated parameters and whether the second observed data set can be matched to a direct model output the model performance can either increase or decrease using multi objective calibration a low parameter model is limited in flexibility to fit the variance of the target variable therefore constraining such a model during multi objective calibration results in typical trade off scenarios vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 for example during multi objective calibration of a hydrological model using two unrelated observed data sets vervoort et al 2014 identified that either the parameters optimise the streamflow fit or the parameters optimise the evapotranspiration fit however such trade offs between different observational data sets or different objective functions based on a single observational data set also occur for more complex models dumedah et al 2012 the distinct trade off in multi objective calibrations is in essence an equifinality problem beven 1993 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 as a whole multi objective calibration may result in reduced individual parameter uncertainty and a more robust model but an increased number of optimal parameters sets may be identified plotting the trade off between objective function values of the two calibration variables for example q and lai generally forms a so called pareto front fowler et al 2016 vrugt et al 2003 all points on the pareto front are associated with parameter sets that produce superior model performance compared to any points that lie off the front vrugt et al 2003 the best compromise solution or solutions if identifiable gupta et al 1998 are hidden in the front and searching for them is time consuming chen et al 2015 dumedah et al 2012 and there is no clear established automatic identification method dumedah et al 2012 dumedah et al 2010 pareto fronts have been useful beyond visualising trade offs for example points along a generated pareto front can be used as priors in bayesian multiple objective calibration allowing the results to be interpreted probabilistically tang et al 2018 multi objective calibration approaches also present unique opportunities in model verification since being proposed by kleme≈° 1986 there has been significant focus in hydrology on the differential split sample test dsst as a robust model test donnelly makowecki and moore 1999 fowler et al 2016 and dsst is easily adapted to a multi objective setting in most cases a model underperforms during testing validation compared to calibration for example see coron et al 2012 poor validation performance has mostly been attributed to poor objective function choice i e the objective function does not adequately describe the distribution of errors yapo et al 1998 resulting in research focused on robust objective function selection fowler et al 2018b in addition calibration validation techniques model structural issues and changes in conditions between calibration and validation period have been suggested as causes for underperformance during validation fowler et al 2016 2018a motavita et al 2019 saft et al 2015 pareto fronts have also been used in this context to compare trade offs between model performance during single objective calibration and validation and to compare different calibration objective functions of a single dataset as in a multi metric approach fowler et al 2016 this concept can be extended as a diagnostic tool for model underperformance resulting in suggestion of appropriate remedial action to improve performance fowler et al 2018a however apart from probably dumedah et al 2012 there have been no studies which combine multi objective calibration with the dsst approach and a pareto front the work by dumedah et al 2012 used a multi metric approach and was mainly focused on automatically finding the single best solution on the pareto front and checking whether this was still a non dominant solution during validation apart from this study we could not find any studies comparing the changes in the pareto front solutions between a calibration and validation period however there could be much more to learn from how the solutions from the calibration pareto front behave during validation for example how do solutions from the calibration shift in the pareto front space to form the validation solutions fig 1 this can link to analyses of parameter and objective function clustering as suggested by dumedah et al 2012 a further question is how this relates to the type of multi objective approach that is taken for example dumedah et al 2012 used a multi metric approach but this might differ from using two independent data sets sikorska et al 2015 tang et al 2018 in addition the use of different data sets may interact with the model structure resulting in further complications for example using state variables such as soil moisture or groundwater levels could have different results from using flux variables such as streamflow and actual evapotranspiration et estimates given this the aim of this study is to identify how solutions on a multi objective pareto front shift between calibration solutions and the associated validation results and if this shift can be used to assist in the identification of best compromise solution s for future predictions a secondary aim is to identify whether different data types and combinations impact calibration and validation outcomes and how this might relate to model structure 2 materials and methods within an ecohydrological model the relationship between the hydrological and ecological processes can be investigated asbjornsen et al 2011 given that an ecohydrological model is more complex than the sum of its parts it requires more data for model conditioning then a traditional hydrological model tang et al 2018 this has led to the implementation of multi objective model optimization to calibrate ecohydrological models where both hydrological and ecological components are simultaneously optimised aiming for improved model performance naseem et al 2015 tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 the corin catchment in the australian capital territory act being predominantly forested provides a useful focus catchment for a multi objective calibration of an ecohydrological model assisted by the availability of open access remotely sensed vegetation data 2 1 catchment and data the focus catchment for this study was the corin catchment located in australia s south east on the western edge of the australian capital territory act fig 2 it is a sub catchment of the cotter catchment the catchment is largely forested chester and norris 2006 kim et al 2007 148 km2 in size white et al 2006 and receives on average 934 mm of rainfall per year with the majority of this falling in winter chester and norris 2006 the larger cotter catchment although relatively undisturbed has dams in multiple places on its major tributary the cotter river to provide drinking water to the act chester and norris 2006 white et al 2006 this study focused on the undisturbed section upstream of the first dam corin dam daily precipitation p was sourced from the rain gauge at cotter hut potential evapotranspiration pet data for the corin catchment was calculated using morton s algorithm morton 1983 based on weather data from corin dam daily streamflow data was collected from the gingera gauge along the cotter river moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day lai and 8 day et data sets were used to observe vegetation dynamics in the catchment the modis et data is cumulative over eight days mm 8day and was simply divided by 8 to obtain a daily average on the reporting date modis quality flags were checked for the 144 tiles identified in the catchment and those of low quality removed the remaining modis tiles were averaged to be used in the spatially lumped ecohydrological model the catchment maximum lai value is 4 8 leaf area m2 ground area m2 and this value is used as a parameter in the ecohydrological model table 1 provides a summary of the variables and their sources data from 01 to 01 2008 to 31 12 2014 was used for model calibration and data from 01 to 01 2015 to 04 02 2018 was used for model validation due to a forest fire that affected the majority of the catchment in 2003 white et al 2006 earlier data indicated an effect of fire on vegetation fig 3 and as such was not used in the analysis 2 2 model the model for this study is a lumped conceptual ecohydrological model fig 4 tang et al 2018 created by coupling hymod boyle et al 2003 wagener et al 2001 a rainfall runoff model and a modified bucket grassland model bgm istanbulluoglu et al 2012 hymod consists of a soil moisture tank connected to both a quick flow tank and slow flow tank routing surface and sub surface flow respectively bgm is used to simulate biomass dynamics the models are coupled via the replacement of bgm s soil moisture dynamics with hymod s soil moisture tank fig 4 the model input variables are daily p and pet possible model output variables mirror the data used in model calibration and validation daily q lai and actual et estimates outlined in red in fig 4 et is an intermediate variable in the model that is used to calculate lai but can be isolated as an output variable following tang et al 2018 out of the 20 model parameters seven are calibrated and one the maximum lai is determined on a catchment basis the remaining parameters are fixed based on values found in the literature table 2 3 tang et al 2018 provides additional information about the model and parameters 2 3 multi objective approach the ecohydrological model is calibrated using a combination of the q and lai data or using a combination of the q and et data fig 5 validation was based on the same data pairings and the parameter values identified during calibration fig 5 the objective function minimised the variance of the residuals between the predicted model output and the observed data starting from the model equation where f is the combined model which produces two output series 1 q y f p e t p Œ∏ Œµ here q is the observed streamflow series y is the second observed series actual et or lai in this study p is the precipitation etp is the potential et Œ∏ is a vector of parameters and Œµ is the combined model residuals this means we can define the combined residuals Œµ for the two observed series 2 Œµ q f p e t p Œ∏ y f p e t p Œ∏ or 3 Œµ Œµ q Œµ y q f p e t p Œ∏ y f p e t p Œ∏ a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 was applied to q with the transformation parameter Œª fixed at 0 3 based on the suggestion of thyer et al 2002 a box cox transformation is commonly applied to hydrological data to approximate normality thyer et al 2002 which results in 4 Œµ Œµ q Œµ y q Œª f p e t p Œ∏ Œª y f p e t p Œ∏ therefore if we choose the variance of the residuals as our performance measure the objective function can be written as 5 obj m i n Œµ q Œµ q 2 n 1 Œµ y Œµ y 2 n 1 where n is the number of observations equation 5 clearly demonstrates the trade off between the variance of the residuals of q and the variance of the residuals of the second observed variable y to minimise the effect of the choice of initial lai and catchment storage values in the parameters on the simulations the first year for both calibration and validation periods was used as a warm up period to condition the model this period was then discarded for the subsequent analysis 2 3 1 generating pareto fronts pareto based multi objective calibration was based on the multi objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem algorithm vrugt et al 2003 in matlab r2019b the moscem algorithm uses the pareto dominance concept to multi objectively optimise a hydrological model and generate a pareto set which can be visualised in both the objective space and parameter space vrugt et al 2003 here the moscem algorithm is used to simultaneously minimise the residual variance of transformed q and lai or the residual variance of transformed q and et in all simulations 10 complexes and 100 loops were defined the optimised objective function solutions were visualised on a pareto front using r version 3 6 0 r core team 2019 2 4 autoselection methods the four autoselection methods described by dumedah et al 2010 and dumedah et al 2012 were used post calibration to select an optimal solution from the calibration pareto front the details of the different dumedah autoselection methods are outlined in table 4 the cluster analysis for the autoselection used the kmeans function in the factoextra r package kassambara and mundt 2017 2 5 validation for both data combinations q et and q lai the parameter sets identified from the autoselection methods table 4 were used to simulate the output variables q lai or q et based on the validation data the performance of the parameter sets at the autoselection points using the validation data was based on the same objective functions and compared to the calibration pareto front following the approach outlined in dumedah et al 2012 subsequently the parameter sets from all pareto solutions derived from moscem optimisation were used to simulate the output variables q lai or q et using the validation data and once again the performance was calculated using the same objective functions each of these validation solutions were visualised in the objective space overlaid on the calibration pareto front from which they originated as outlined in fig 1 but for all points on the calibration pareto front the validation solutions were subsequently ranked based on proximity as measured by euclidean distance to the true origin 0 0 of the objective space which in essence is the ipo solution from dumedah et al 2010 dumedah et al 2012 but applied to the validation solutions based on this ranking the 10 points closest to the origin were deemed superior having optimal performance during both calibration as they were located on the original pareto front and validation as they were closest to the origin with the lowest multi objective residual variance a cross validation was also performed this involved validating the parameter sets associated with the q lai optimized solutions i e q lai calibration pareto front on their performance in the q et objective space and vice versa 2 6 calibration and validation data sets the distribution of the streamflow lai and et data differs between the calibration and validation periods table 5 figs 6 7 the calibration period experienced multiple high flow events which is reflected in the characteristics of the daily flows particularly the maximum and standard deviation and the flow duration curve table 5 fig 6 these were mostly absent during the validation period fig 6 this difference in conditions suggests that in essence a differential split sample test was performed kleme≈° 1986 xu 1999 rather than a split sample test however this was not an explicit aim of the study 3 results 3 1 calibration pareto front all points on the generated pareto front can be thought of as having equal performance during calibration and being superior compared to any points that would lie to the right of the front the points indicate what the optimisation algorithm identifies as the lowest objective functions across all the optimisations therefore the parameter sets associated with these points can also be thought of as being superior in terms of describing the processes in the catchment during the calibration period as they result in the least residual variance equation 5 the calibration pareto fronts show a similar trade off as observed by tang et al 2018 where a reduction in the residual variance of transformed q occurs at the detriment of the residual variance of lai or et fig 8 this trade off results in a concave shaped front each pareto front is the result of multiple optimizations as check for consistency the optimization algorithm was run multiple times and the resulting pareto fronts were consistent between runs results not shown there is a distinct jump in the q et pareto front fig 8 where the residual variance of et improves greatly leading to a subsequent deterioration in the residual variance of q this also results in a much noisier front which is likely related to the combination of an uneven objective function field and the way the moscem routine searches this field vrugt et al 2003 and will be discussed later the isolated point in the q et pareto front fig 8 is likely a local minimum identified by the moscem algorithm and is therefore included in the final set 3 2 autoselection methods for the q lai data pairing all four autoselection selection methods table 4 identified solutions from a similar region on the calibration pareto front fig 9 these compromise solutions from the four autoselection methods all cluster around the middle of the calibration pareto front where the improvement in the residual variance of lai is balanced by the improvement in the residual variance of q fig 9 following dumedah et al 2012 the identified compromise solutions were applied to the validation data this resulted in those solutions in the validation phase being located close to the residual variance of q axis in the lower left portion of the figure this indicates that those solutions have a similar residual variance of lai for all the parameter combinations in the solutions but these combinations result in a decreased performance in relation to q fig 1 fig 9 given that during the validation the residual variance of lai of all solutions was similar one of the bapf solutions stands out as having the lowest residual variance in q compared to the other solutions fig 9 this means that this solution can be seen as the best performing solution across all compromise solutions however the worst performing autoselection solution during validation was also a bapf solution as the bapf solution is based on the objective space it is possible for multiple parameter sets to be associated with the same objective function values and therefore this autoselection method finds more than one optimal set of parameters which could all have different performance during validation as seen here fig 1 fig 9 it is also clear that as identified by dumedah et al 2012 not all solutions that are non dominated on the pareto front in the calibration are also non dominated in the validation as outlined above the q et data pairing produced a less defined pareto front fig 8 similarly the points identified by the autoselection methods on the calibration pareto front also resulted in three of the methods clustering around low residual variance in q and one ipo with much lower residual variance in et fig 9 once again one of the bapf solutions was superior in performance during validation however the majority of autoselection points performed poorly during validation fig 9 again multiple parameter sets were associated with the bapf solution fig 9 3 3 objective function performance during validation of all parameter sets from the calibration pareto front in the validation space the points deviated strongly from the calibration pareto front counterparts for both data pairings fig 10 the shift does not appear to follow a specific pattern fig 1 with the position of the validation solutions not mirroring their position on the corresponding calibration pareto front fig 10 displayed via the colour gradient points that had low residual variance for q coloured blue during calibration did not necessarily have low residual variance for q during validation and vice versa therefore no consistent pattern relative to fig 1 could be identified during the validation of lai and q multi objective calibration the majority of the validation points showed reduced residual variance for lai but increased residual variance for q i e the front shifted down and to the right fig 10 in other words the performance in predicting q was worse similar to the autoselection methods presented earlier but the performance in predicting lai improved the validation solutions based on the q and et multi objective calibration also showed two distinct groups similar to the calibration front but the points themselves shifted fig 10 to identify which calibration parameter sets were best performing during validation those located closest to the origin during validation are highlighted the residual variance for both objectives is at a minimum during both calibration and validation in both instances no distinct section of the calibration pareto front supplies these solutions during validation fig 10 looking at broader trends on the origins of the 10 best validation points on the calibration front the q lai data pairing had the majority of points in the area of the calibration pareto front with lower lai residual variance purple red while the opposite occurred with the q et data pairing fig 10 comparing the performance of the autoselection methods during validation to the complete set of validation solutions highlighted that only the bapf method was able to approach the best validation points identified in our approach fig 9 fig 10 the other autoselection methods particularly when applied to the q et data pairing resulted in lower validation performance in the objective space i e increased residual variance for both objectives fig 9 fig 10 overall the cross validation solutions showed a directional trend where calibrating on q lai suggested more universal parameter sets and more consistent performance fig 11 in the q et objective function space the parameter sets produced during calibration on q lai had similar validation performance as those produced during calibration on q et fig 11 in fig 11 this is shown by the q lai cross validation solutions overlapping the q et validation solutions this did not occur in reverse the parameter sets produced during calibration on q et underperformed during validation compared to those produced during calibration on q lai in the q lai objective function space fig 11 the likely cause of this directionality is that in the model et is a flux variable that drives the state variable lai the result of this is that calibrating on q lai inherently includes information about et which results in good performance when moving from the q lai to the q et objective space however calibrating on q et does not include information on lai the influence of flux and state variables is discussed further in section 4 1 the distributions of three of the seven calibrated parameters from the moscem optimised output are shown in fig 12 the prior values and lower and upper bounds for each parameter can be found in tables 2 and 3 generally there was increased variation in the parameter distributions when the model is calibrated on the q and et data fig 12 there is one exception to this calibrated parameter kq fig 12 the individual parameter values of the 10 best parameter sets for the q and lai data do not show obvious clustering fig 12 similar to the calibration pareto front and validation solution results fig 10 however there is some indication in parameters for the q and et data that there is a bimodal distribution especially for the ks and wue parameters 4 discussion the performance of a calibrated model often declines when tested on an independent validation data set fowler et al 2018a the results in this study support this as poorer performance was more common than improved performance during validation fig 10 in relation to the theoretical shifts highlighted in fig 1 no consistent pattern could be identified as has been highlighted in the literature this questions whether a model that performs adequately during calibration can be used for forecasts and predictions especially under changing climatic conditions montanari et al 2013 saft et al 2016 saft et al 2015 while this study provides further insight into pareto fronts as a tool to identify model performance it also indicates that a parameter set on the calibration pareto front does not necessarily maintain model performance in validation e g vervoort et al 2014 the trade off between the two calibration data sets means that an optimal parameter set across a differential split sample remains elusive 4 1 differences between the q and et and the q and lai data sets comparing the residual variances from the q and et data set multi objective calibration to the residual variances from the q and lai calibration fig 8 shows that the residual variance of et is greater than the residual variance of lai in contrast the residual variances of q between the two sets are similar the increased range of residual variances for q and et fig 8 is a result of the model structure lai as a state variable is described in hymod bgm as a smoothly changing differential equation where the change in lai is related to the et flux and therefore net primary production npp fig 2 and tang et al 2018 as a result lai changes smoothly in time and can be fitted easier with the sparse 8 daily observed data and this leads to low residual variances in contrast et is a flux term which changes rapidly from time step to time step and is calculated fairly simplistically as the minimum of potential et and soil water storage in the model this results in fairly abrupt changes in et which shoots up to potential et in wet periods and can reduce to 0 in periods without rain depending on the magnitude of potential et and the size of the soil moisture tank parameter huz in the model table 2 furthermore during the optimisation of the model parameters the et flux is adjusted to correct the water balance in conceptual models vervoort et al 2014 constraining both the et and q output in the optimisation therefore leads to larger residual variances for the et data compared to residual variances of lai when constraining lai and q in this last case the model optimisation can close the water balance by adjusting et also resulting in smaller variance of q the cause of the jump gap observed in the q et calibration pareto front fig 8 is likely the result of the same model structural issues resulting in a multi model response surface with local minima in which moscem identifies a solution leading to a ragged or noisy pareto front the earlier approach dumedah et al 2012 fig 9 demonstrates clearly that it remains difficult to think of a single best solution in a multi objective calibration even if we are considering this as compromise solution none of the earlier identified approaches results in a validation result that is as good as the calibration results and the bapf solution results in multiple solutions clearly highlighting equifinality in the parameters sets this is further exemplified by the fact that none of the best validation results fig 10 match up with the autoselection results fig 9 and the fact that the best validation results originate from all across the pareto calibration front this also agrees with the earlier findings of dumedah et al 2012 the lack of clustering of the 10 best parameter sets from the validation in any region along the calibration pareto front suggests that validation does not provide a straightforward method to reduce the equifinality in the multi objective calibration front and identify a final robust parameter set the narrower posterior parameter distributions of the q and lai calibrations might be simply a result of lai as an observed data set not fully constraining the model point 2 above discussing the difference between the q and et and q and lai residual variance while the final parameter distribution is narrower and suggesting a more unique solution this does not result in a better dsst performance in contrast while the q and et parameter distributions are less unique they result in a better dsst performance the shift in the validation solutions from the calibration pareto front for the q and et data set is quite different from the shift for the q and lai data set fig 10 however in both cases the validation results in an improvement in the residual variance of the secondary variable lai and et and slight deterioration in the residual variance of q the reduction in the residual variance in q is smaller in overall range for the q and et data set which suggests that although the overall residual variance for this combination is higher the actual behaviour in the differential split sample test dsst is fairly similar this is an improvement in the behaviour compared to the q and lai data where the shift from the calibration front is large and in the direction of a reduced performance in the dsst fig 1 fig 10 4 2 information content and calibration success the information content of the data sets used for multi objective calibration differs affecting the final parameter estimation rode et al 2007 the pairing of daily gauged streamflow data with aggregated or averaged 8 day satellite vegetation data as undertaken in this study has been seen as problematic due to the lower reliability of satellite observations tang et al 2018 this study compared two types of satellite data lai and et with q to identify if one of the input sets is superior for improved model predictions the findings suggest that the q et data pairing is preferred as model performance is less likely to decline when validated suggesting more robust parameter estimation fig 10 this is likely due to et being a flux variable which better constrains the model vervoort et al 2014 4 3 testing environmental models the testing or validation of hydrological models is a well researched area catalysed by kleme≈° 1986 who provided a systematic framework within which a model could be tested the simplest test a split sample test sst is less often used than the more rigorous counterpart the differential split sample test dsst this tests the model ability to assess performance under conditions that vary from those during calibration coron et al 2012 gaborit et al 2015 refsgaard et al 2014 however the results of this study table 2 fig 6 fig 7 as well as those of xu 1999 show that a dsst generally occurs often unintentionally when data is split to form calibration and validation data sets in this study we actively tried to avoid non stationarity via the exclusion of a fire affected period but this still occurred because of climate variation table 5 fig 3 fig 6 fig 7 as environmental variation is observed on all time scales whether daily monthly or yearly descroix et al 2009 sch√§r et al 2004 sorooshian et al 1983 a true sst is almost impossible in observed environmental data sets from this it could be argued that the majority of model validation is more rigorous then intended and the commonly observed changed performance is explainable due to non stationarity in the data series the approach in this study comparing calibration pareto front and validation solutions builds on the earlier work tang et al 2018 vervoort et al 2014 indicating that multi objective calibration amplifies structural limitations in conceptual models this creates future opportunities for improving model structures and testing model structures such as combining with other approaches euser et al 2013 fenicia et al 2014 thirel et al 2015 in particular there are two directions that can be pursued for further development so far most of the earlier work to understand model structural or performance limitations has focused on just streamflow mostly using a multi metric approach euser et al 2013 fowler et al 2018a thirel et al 2015 it is clear from this study that using a multi variable approach and in particular using a combination of different flux variables offers the best option to identify behavioural issues in models a second approach is to extend the current analysis to a bayesian approach in combination with testing different model structures the parameter distributions identified from the best validation solution can be seen as a prior distribution for a further bayesian analysis tang et al 2018 of particular interest would be how the posterior parameter distributions would differ as a result of informative or non informative input data and as a function of model structure for example we would expect that models with a better representation of the et process would result in satellite et being a more informative input and thus result in more stable posterior distributions this is part of our ongoing work in this area 4 4 limitations and future work there are several limitations of this study notably the limited spatial and temporal scale a single catchment was the focus of this research so expanding the results beyond this especially to different biomes is not advised to extend this work it would be beneficial to apply the methodology to other areas with different weather patterns and vegetation types e g tropical rainforest grasslands the limited data availability a result of the span of the modis data and the large fire that impacted the majority of the catchment restricted the division into calibration and validation periods if additional data was available a second validation could be undertaken to assess if the 10 best parameter sets remained consistent during re validation a different approach could be to reverse the calibration and validation period to test this if the new superior points were to come from other points on the calibration front it would support the conclusion that no single area of the front can be identified to provide robust parameter sets for universal use as highlighted in the introduction spatially gridded models can take advantage of the spatial heterogeneity in the satellite data e g kundu et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 demb√©l√© et al 2020a demb√©l√© et al 2020b and soltani et al 2021 the lumped conceptual ecohydrological model in this study could not be fully leverage this in the same way as in a distributed model as the modis tiles were averaged future work building on this could be a model intercomparison breuer et al 2009 knoben et al 2020 li et al 2009 where several models lumped and distributed can be compared and generate pareto fronts however this will involve several further methodological questions including differences in model structures and the number of free parameters in the model the absolute and relative accuracy and uncertainties in the observed data streamflow satellite et and satellite lai was not explicitly considered in this study while there is little direct data to estimate the accuracy tomkins 2014 estimated the accuracy of streamflow gauging in australia and found uncertainties around 20 glenn et al 2011 reported similar uncertainties for satellite et estimates given that the main focus is the difference between the lai and et data sets the relative difference in uncertainty and accuracy could explain some of the differences in our study given that the lai and et satellite products were derived from the same satellite we assumed uncertainties were similar and therefore this effect was less than the other effects indicated earlier in the future other algorithms could be tested such as the pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search pa dds algorithm asadzadeh and tolson 2009 comparing the pareto front generated by different algorithms such as moscem and pa dds can further confirm the findings of this study i e the pareto front established during calibration does not hold up during validation 5 conclusion in a multi objective calibration the choice of data period the type of data flux versus state and the model structure all influence the resulting pareto front this research further strengthens two points in relation to multi objective calibration of conceptual models 1 the pareto front simply represents a distribution of equifinal solutions with only some of the solutions performing well on an independent validation data set and 2 it remains difficult to identify one optimal parameter set from pareto solutions in the end it is clear that we need a systematic approach to use multi objective calibration with two flux variables to improve

1862,calibrating a hydrological model using more than one independent data set multi objective calibration can potentially improve parameter estimation however it often identifies multiple parameter sets whose combined performance is generally indistinguishable as visualized via a pareto front the objective of this paper is to identify how pareto optimal solutions perform during model validation and to identify how objective function tradeoffs in calibration might shift along the pareto front during validation model calibration was based on an ecohydrological model simulating leaf area index lai evapotranspiration et and streamflow focusing on a predominantly forested australian catchment and using satellite derived lai and et with observed streamflow for calibration gave understanding of differences in model behavior related to observed data the performance shifts between validation and calibration periods were assessed for combinations of et and streamflow and lai and streamflow for both observed data combinations the performance deteriorated between calibration to validation and the best performing validation parameter solutions were scattered along the calibration pareto front in general the streamflow lai data pairing showed a greater deterioration in streamflow performance in validation compared to the streamflow et data pairing however in both cases there was significant parameter equifinality the results highlight that model structural limitations are a greater issue for model validation performance than in calibration the identification of one optimal parameter set from a pareto set remains elusive keywords multi objective calibration bgm hymod moscem data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction multi objective calibration of hydrological models has frequently been suggested as a way to reduce bias and uncertainty in model simulations when compared to single objective calibration dumedah et al 2012 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 franks et al 1999 and in particular to address parameter uncertainty tang et al 2018 multi objective calibration involves calibrating model parameters on two or more objective functions vrugt et al 2003 and several studies have focused on different performance indicators related to streamflow dumedah et al 2012 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 zhang et al 2018 in these studies the two competing objectives are both based on the same observed data for example bias and rmse dumedah et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 this is sometimes referred to as multi metric calibration pfannerstill et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 another multi objective approach has been to look at multiple sites within a catchment delivering a spatial multi objective or multi site calibration molina navarro et al 2017 piniewski and okruszko 2011 the final alternative is using two or more independent observed timeseries data sets for example streamflow q and leaf area index lai and therefore two truly independent objective functions in the hope of further constraining model parameters rajib et al 2016 tang et al 2018 vervoort et al 2014 in recent years many other studies have integrated satellite data with large distributed models this work using large scale and generally gridded models has built on the original work of immerzeel and droogers 2008 and immerzeel et al 2008 taking advantage of the increased spatial information in gridded satellite products to improve hydrological predictions e g kundu et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 demb√©l√© et al 2020a demb√©l√© et al 2020b and soltani et al 2021 however in many practical hydrological applications lumped conceptual models are still mainstream and therefore there is a need to develop methods and strategies to incorporate the now abundant satellite information into such models using the increased temporal information multi objective calibration in general and calibration on two observed data sets in particular can potentially improve parameterisation multi metric calibration improves parameterisation as the different metrics of a single dataset i e objective functions target different parts of the flow duration curve zhang et al 2016 two independent observed data sets in multi objective calibration provide information on different physical processes within the catchment sikorska et al 2015 vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 for example plant growth and runoff generation as a result the derived parameter sets are more likely to be reliable and robust efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 and therefore less likely to be overfitted calibration using multiple data sets can also improve model performance i e consensus between model simulations and observed data finger et al 2015 sikorska et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 however improved parameter estimations and improved simulation performance is not guaranteed vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 depending on the structure of the model the number of calibrated parameters and whether the second observed data set can be matched to a direct model output the model performance can either increase or decrease using multi objective calibration a low parameter model is limited in flexibility to fit the variance of the target variable therefore constraining such a model during multi objective calibration results in typical trade off scenarios vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 for example during multi objective calibration of a hydrological model using two unrelated observed data sets vervoort et al 2014 identified that either the parameters optimise the streamflow fit or the parameters optimise the evapotranspiration fit however such trade offs between different observational data sets or different objective functions based on a single observational data set also occur for more complex models dumedah et al 2012 the distinct trade off in multi objective calibrations is in essence an equifinality problem beven 1993 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 as a whole multi objective calibration may result in reduced individual parameter uncertainty and a more robust model but an increased number of optimal parameters sets may be identified plotting the trade off between objective function values of the two calibration variables for example q and lai generally forms a so called pareto front fowler et al 2016 vrugt et al 2003 all points on the pareto front are associated with parameter sets that produce superior model performance compared to any points that lie off the front vrugt et al 2003 the best compromise solution or solutions if identifiable gupta et al 1998 are hidden in the front and searching for them is time consuming chen et al 2015 dumedah et al 2012 and there is no clear established automatic identification method dumedah et al 2012 dumedah et al 2010 pareto fronts have been useful beyond visualising trade offs for example points along a generated pareto front can be used as priors in bayesian multiple objective calibration allowing the results to be interpreted probabilistically tang et al 2018 multi objective calibration approaches also present unique opportunities in model verification since being proposed by kleme≈° 1986 there has been significant focus in hydrology on the differential split sample test dsst as a robust model test donnelly makowecki and moore 1999 fowler et al 2016 and dsst is easily adapted to a multi objective setting in most cases a model underperforms during testing validation compared to calibration for example see coron et al 2012 poor validation performance has mostly been attributed to poor objective function choice i e the objective function does not adequately describe the distribution of errors yapo et al 1998 resulting in research focused on robust objective function selection fowler et al 2018b in addition calibration validation techniques model structural issues and changes in conditions between calibration and validation period have been suggested as causes for underperformance during validation fowler et al 2016 2018a motavita et al 2019 saft et al 2015 pareto fronts have also been used in this context to compare trade offs between model performance during single objective calibration and validation and to compare different calibration objective functions of a single dataset as in a multi metric approach fowler et al 2016 this concept can be extended as a diagnostic tool for model underperformance resulting in suggestion of appropriate remedial action to improve performance fowler et al 2018a however apart from probably dumedah et al 2012 there have been no studies which combine multi objective calibration with the dsst approach and a pareto front the work by dumedah et al 2012 used a multi metric approach and was mainly focused on automatically finding the single best solution on the pareto front and checking whether this was still a non dominant solution during validation apart from this study we could not find any studies comparing the changes in the pareto front solutions between a calibration and validation period however there could be much more to learn from how the solutions from the calibration pareto front behave during validation for example how do solutions from the calibration shift in the pareto front space to form the validation solutions fig 1 this can link to analyses of parameter and objective function clustering as suggested by dumedah et al 2012 a further question is how this relates to the type of multi objective approach that is taken for example dumedah et al 2012 used a multi metric approach but this might differ from using two independent data sets sikorska et al 2015 tang et al 2018 in addition the use of different data sets may interact with the model structure resulting in further complications for example using state variables such as soil moisture or groundwater levels could have different results from using flux variables such as streamflow and actual evapotranspiration et estimates given this the aim of this study is to identify how solutions on a multi objective pareto front shift between calibration solutions and the associated validation results and if this shift can be used to assist in the identification of best compromise solution s for future predictions a secondary aim is to identify whether different data types and combinations impact calibration and validation outcomes and how this might relate to model structure 2 materials and methods within an ecohydrological model the relationship between the hydrological and ecological processes can be investigated asbjornsen et al 2011 given that an ecohydrological model is more complex than the sum of its parts it requires more data for model conditioning then a traditional hydrological model tang et al 2018 this has led to the implementation of multi objective model optimization to calibrate ecohydrological models where both hydrological and ecological components are simultaneously optimised aiming for improved model performance naseem et al 2015 tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 the corin catchment in the australian capital territory act being predominantly forested provides a useful focus catchment for a multi objective calibration of an ecohydrological model assisted by the availability of open access remotely sensed vegetation data 2 1 catchment and data the focus catchment for this study was the corin catchment located in australia s south east on the western edge of the australian capital territory act fig 2 it is a sub catchment of the cotter catchment the catchment is largely forested chester and norris 2006 kim et al 2007 148 km2 in size white et al 2006 and receives on average 934 mm of rainfall per year with the majority of this falling in winter chester and norris 2006 the larger cotter catchment although relatively undisturbed has dams in multiple places on its major tributary the cotter river to provide drinking water to the act chester and norris 2006 white et al 2006 this study focused on the undisturbed section upstream of the first dam corin dam daily precipitation p was sourced from the rain gauge at cotter hut potential evapotranspiration pet data for the corin catchment was calculated using morton s algorithm morton 1983 based on weather data from corin dam daily streamflow data was collected from the gingera gauge along the cotter river moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day lai and 8 day et data sets were used to observe vegetation dynamics in the catchment the modis et data is cumulative over eight days mm 8day and was simply divided by 8 to obtain a daily average on the reporting date modis quality flags were checked for the 144 tiles identified in the catchment and those of low quality removed the remaining modis tiles were averaged to be used in the spatially lumped ecohydrological model the catchment maximum lai value is 4 8 leaf area m2 ground area m2 and this value is used as a parameter in the ecohydrological model table 1 provides a summary of the variables and their sources data from 01 to 01 2008 to 31 12 2014 was used for model calibration and data from 01 to 01 2015 to 04 02 2018 was used for model validation due to a forest fire that affected the majority of the catchment in 2003 white et al 2006 earlier data indicated an effect of fire on vegetation fig 3 and as such was not used in the analysis 2 2 model the model for this study is a lumped conceptual ecohydrological model fig 4 tang et al 2018 created by coupling hymod boyle et al 2003 wagener et al 2001 a rainfall runoff model and a modified bucket grassland model bgm istanbulluoglu et al 2012 hymod consists of a soil moisture tank connected to both a quick flow tank and slow flow tank routing surface and sub surface flow respectively bgm is used to simulate biomass dynamics the models are coupled via the replacement of bgm s soil moisture dynamics with hymod s soil moisture tank fig 4 the model input variables are daily p and pet possible model output variables mirror the data used in model calibration and validation daily q lai and actual et estimates outlined in red in fig 4 et is an intermediate variable in the model that is used to calculate lai but can be isolated as an output variable following tang et al 2018 out of the 20 model parameters seven are calibrated and one the maximum lai is determined on a catchment basis the remaining parameters are fixed based on values found in the literature table 2 3 tang et al 2018 provides additional information about the model and parameters 2 3 multi objective approach the ecohydrological model is calibrated using a combination of the q and lai data or using a combination of the q and et data fig 5 validation was based on the same data pairings and the parameter values identified during calibration fig 5 the objective function minimised the variance of the residuals between the predicted model output and the observed data starting from the model equation where f is the combined model which produces two output series 1 q y f p e t p Œ∏ Œµ here q is the observed streamflow series y is the second observed series actual et or lai in this study p is the precipitation etp is the potential et Œ∏ is a vector of parameters and Œµ is the combined model residuals this means we can define the combined residuals Œµ for the two observed series 2 Œµ q f p e t p Œ∏ y f p e t p Œ∏ or 3 Œµ Œµ q Œµ y q f p e t p Œ∏ y f p e t p Œ∏ a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 was applied to q with the transformation parameter Œª fixed at 0 3 based on the suggestion of thyer et al 2002 a box cox transformation is commonly applied to hydrological data to approximate normality thyer et al 2002 which results in 4 Œµ Œµ q Œµ y q Œª f p e t p Œ∏ Œª y f p e t p Œ∏ therefore if we choose the variance of the residuals as our performance measure the objective function can be written as 5 obj m i n Œµ q Œµ q 2 n 1 Œµ y Œµ y 2 n 1 where n is the number of observations equation 5 clearly demonstrates the trade off between the variance of the residuals of q and the variance of the residuals of the second observed variable y to minimise the effect of the choice of initial lai and catchment storage values in the parameters on the simulations the first year for both calibration and validation periods was used as a warm up period to condition the model this period was then discarded for the subsequent analysis 2 3 1 generating pareto fronts pareto based multi objective calibration was based on the multi objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem algorithm vrugt et al 2003 in matlab r2019b the moscem algorithm uses the pareto dominance concept to multi objectively optimise a hydrological model and generate a pareto set which can be visualised in both the objective space and parameter space vrugt et al 2003 here the moscem algorithm is used to simultaneously minimise the residual variance of transformed q and lai or the residual variance of transformed q and et in all simulations 10 complexes and 100 loops were defined the optimised objective function solutions were visualised on a pareto front using r version 3 6 0 r core team 2019 2 4 autoselection methods the four autoselection methods described by dumedah et al 2010 and dumedah et al 2012 were used post calibration to select an optimal solution from the calibration pareto front the details of the different dumedah autoselection methods are outlined in table 4 the cluster analysis for the autoselection used the kmeans function in the factoextra r package kassambara and mundt 2017 2 5 validation for both data combinations q et and q lai the parameter sets identified from the autoselection methods table 4 were used to simulate the output variables q lai or q et based on the validation data the performance of the parameter sets at the autoselection points using the validation data was based on the same objective functions and compared to the calibration pareto front following the approach outlined in dumedah et al 2012 subsequently the parameter sets from all pareto solutions derived from moscem optimisation were used to simulate the output variables q lai or q et using the validation data and once again the performance was calculated using the same objective functions each of these validation solutions were visualised in the objective space overlaid on the calibration pareto front from which they originated as outlined in fig 1 but for all points on the calibration pareto front the validation solutions were subsequently ranked based on proximity as measured by euclidean distance to the true origin 0 0 of the objective space which in essence is the ipo solution from dumedah et al 2010 dumedah et al 2012 but applied to the validation solutions based on this ranking the 10 points closest to the origin were deemed superior having optimal performance during both calibration as they were located on the original pareto front and validation as they were closest to the origin with the lowest multi objective residual variance a cross validation was also performed this involved validating the parameter sets associated with the q lai optimized solutions i e q lai calibration pareto front on their performance in the q et objective space and vice versa 2 6 calibration and validation data sets the distribution of the streamflow lai and et data differs between the calibration and validation periods table 5 figs 6 7 the calibration period experienced multiple high flow events which is reflected in the characteristics of the daily flows particularly the maximum and standard deviation and the flow duration curve table 5 fig 6 these were mostly absent during the validation period fig 6 this difference in conditions suggests that in essence a differential split sample test was performed kleme≈° 1986 xu 1999 rather than a split sample test however this was not an explicit aim of the study 3 results 3 1 calibration pareto front all points on the generated pareto front can be thought of as having equal performance during calibration and being superior compared to any points that would lie to the right of the front the points indicate what the optimisation algorithm identifies as the lowest objective functions across all the optimisations therefore the parameter sets associated with these points can also be thought of as being superior in terms of describing the processes in the catchment during the calibration period as they result in the least residual variance equation 5 the calibration pareto fronts show a similar trade off as observed by tang et al 2018 where a reduction in the residual variance of transformed q occurs at the detriment of the residual variance of lai or et fig 8 this trade off results in a concave shaped front each pareto front is the result of multiple optimizations as check for consistency the optimization algorithm was run multiple times and the resulting pareto fronts were consistent between runs results not shown there is a distinct jump in the q et pareto front fig 8 where the residual variance of et improves greatly leading to a subsequent deterioration in the residual variance of q this also results in a much noisier front which is likely related to the combination of an uneven objective function field and the way the moscem routine searches this field vrugt et al 2003 and will be discussed later the isolated point in the q et pareto front fig 8 is likely a local minimum identified by the moscem algorithm and is therefore included in the final set 3 2 autoselection methods for the q lai data pairing all four autoselection selection methods table 4 identified solutions from a similar region on the calibration pareto front fig 9 these compromise solutions from the four autoselection methods all cluster around the middle of the calibration pareto front where the improvement in the residual variance of lai is balanced by the improvement in the residual variance of q fig 9 following dumedah et al 2012 the identified compromise solutions were applied to the validation data this resulted in those solutions in the validation phase being located close to the residual variance of q axis in the lower left portion of the figure this indicates that those solutions have a similar residual variance of lai for all the parameter combinations in the solutions but these combinations result in a decreased performance in relation to q fig 1 fig 9 given that during the validation the residual variance of lai of all solutions was similar one of the bapf solutions stands out as having the lowest residual variance in q compared to the other solutions fig 9 this means that this solution can be seen as the best performing solution across all compromise solutions however the worst performing autoselection solution during validation was also a bapf solution as the bapf solution is based on the objective space it is possible for multiple parameter sets to be associated with the same objective function values and therefore this autoselection method finds more than one optimal set of parameters which could all have different performance during validation as seen here fig 1 fig 9 it is also clear that as identified by dumedah et al 2012 not all solutions that are non dominated on the pareto front in the calibration are also non dominated in the validation as outlined above the q et data pairing produced a less defined pareto front fig 8 similarly the points identified by the autoselection methods on the calibration pareto front also resulted in three of the methods clustering around low residual variance in q and one ipo with much lower residual variance in et fig 9 once again one of the bapf solutions was superior in performance during validation however the majority of autoselection points performed poorly during validation fig 9 again multiple parameter sets were associated with the bapf solution fig 9 3 3 objective function performance during validation of all parameter sets from the calibration pareto front in the validation space the points deviated strongly from the calibration pareto front counterparts for both data pairings fig 10 the shift does not appear to follow a specific pattern fig 1 with the position of the validation solutions not mirroring their position on the corresponding calibration pareto front fig 10 displayed via the colour gradient points that had low residual variance for q coloured blue during calibration did not necessarily have low residual variance for q during validation and vice versa therefore no consistent pattern relative to fig 1 could be identified during the validation of lai and q multi objective calibration the majority of the validation points showed reduced residual variance for lai but increased residual variance for q i e the front shifted down and to the right fig 10 in other words the performance in predicting q was worse similar to the autoselection methods presented earlier but the performance in predicting lai improved the validation solutions based on the q and et multi objective calibration also showed two distinct groups similar to the calibration front but the points themselves shifted fig 10 to identify which calibration parameter sets were best performing during validation those located closest to the origin during validation are highlighted the residual variance for both objectives is at a minimum during both calibration and validation in both instances no distinct section of the calibration pareto front supplies these solutions during validation fig 10 looking at broader trends on the origins of the 10 best validation points on the calibration front the q lai data pairing had the majority of points in the area of the calibration pareto front with lower lai residual variance purple red while the opposite occurred with the q et data pairing fig 10 comparing the performance of the autoselection methods during validation to the complete set of validation solutions highlighted that only the bapf method was able to approach the best validation points identified in our approach fig 9 fig 10 the other autoselection methods particularly when applied to the q et data pairing resulted in lower validation performance in the objective space i e increased residual variance for both objectives fig 9 fig 10 overall the cross validation solutions showed a directional trend where calibrating on q lai suggested more universal parameter sets and more consistent performance fig 11 in the q et objective function space the parameter sets produced during calibration on q lai had similar validation performance as those produced during calibration on q et fig 11 in fig 11 this is shown by the q lai cross validation solutions overlapping the q et validation solutions this did not occur in reverse the parameter sets produced during calibration on q et underperformed during validation compared to those produced during calibration on q lai in the q lai objective function space fig 11 the likely cause of this directionality is that in the model et is a flux variable that drives the state variable lai the result of this is that calibrating on q lai inherently includes information about et which results in good performance when moving from the q lai to the q et objective space however calibrating on q et does not include information on lai the influence of flux and state variables is discussed further in section 4 1 the distributions of three of the seven calibrated parameters from the moscem optimised output are shown in fig 12 the prior values and lower and upper bounds for each parameter can be found in tables 2 and 3 generally there was increased variation in the parameter distributions when the model is calibrated on the q and et data fig 12 there is one exception to this calibrated parameter kq fig 12 the individual parameter values of the 10 best parameter sets for the q and lai data do not show obvious clustering fig 12 similar to the calibration pareto front and validation solution results fig 10 however there is some indication in parameters for the q and et data that there is a bimodal distribution especially for the ks and wue parameters 4 discussion the performance of a calibrated model often declines when tested on an independent validation data set fowler et al 2018a the results in this study support this as poorer performance was more common than improved performance during validation fig 10 in relation to the theoretical shifts highlighted in fig 1 no consistent pattern could be identified as has been highlighted in the literature this questions whether a model that performs adequately during calibration can be used for forecasts and predictions especially under changing climatic conditions montanari et al 2013 saft et al 2016 saft et al 2015 while this study provides further insight into pareto fronts as a tool to identify model performance it also indicates that a parameter set on the calibration pareto front does not necessarily maintain model performance in validation e g vervoort et al 2014 the trade off between the two calibration data sets means that an optimal parameter set across a differential split sample remains elusive 4 1 differences between the q and et and the q and lai data sets comparing the residual variances from the q and et data set multi objective calibration to the residual variances from the q and lai calibration fig 8 shows that the residual variance of et is greater than the residual variance of lai in contrast the residual variances of q between the two sets are similar the increased range of residual variances for q and et fig 8 is a result of the model structure lai as a state variable is described in hymod bgm as a smoothly changing differential equation where the change in lai is related to the et flux and therefore net primary production npp fig 2 and tang et al 2018 as a result lai changes smoothly in time and can be fitted easier with the sparse 8 daily observed data and this leads to low residual variances in contrast et is a flux term which changes rapidly from time step to time step and is calculated fairly simplistically as the minimum of potential et and soil water storage in the model this results in fairly abrupt changes in et which shoots up to potential et in wet periods and can reduce to 0 in periods without rain depending on the magnitude of potential et and the size of the soil moisture tank parameter huz in the model table 2 furthermore during the optimisation of the model parameters the et flux is adjusted to correct the water balance in conceptual models vervoort et al 2014 constraining both the et and q output in the optimisation therefore leads to larger residual variances for the et data compared to residual variances of lai when constraining lai and q in this last case the model optimisation can close the water balance by adjusting et also resulting in smaller variance of q the cause of the jump gap observed in the q et calibration pareto front fig 8 is likely the result of the same model structural issues resulting in a multi model response surface with local minima in which moscem identifies a solution leading to a ragged or noisy pareto front the earlier approach dumedah et al 2012 fig 9 demonstrates clearly that it remains difficult to think of a single best solution in a multi objective calibration even if we are considering this as compromise solution none of the earlier identified approaches results in a validation result that is as good as the calibration results and the bapf solution results in multiple solutions clearly highlighting equifinality in the parameters sets this is further exemplified by the fact that none of the best validation results fig 10 match up with the autoselection results fig 9 and the fact that the best validation results originate from all across the pareto calibration front this also agrees with the earlier findings of dumedah et al 2012 the lack of clustering of the 10 best parameter sets from the validation in any region along the calibration pareto front suggests that validation does not provide a straightforward method to reduce the equifinality in the multi objective calibration front and identify a final robust parameter set the narrower posterior parameter distributions of the q and lai calibrations might be simply a result of lai as an observed data set not fully constraining the model point 2 above discussing the difference between the q and et and q and lai residual variance while the final parameter distribution is narrower and suggesting a more unique solution this does not result in a better dsst performance in contrast while the q and et parameter distributions are less unique they result in a better dsst performance the shift in the validation solutions from the calibration pareto front for the q and et data set is quite different from the shift for the q and lai data set fig 10 however in both cases the validation results in an improvement in the residual variance of the secondary variable lai and et and slight deterioration in the residual variance of q the reduction in the residual variance in q is smaller in overall range for the q and et data set which suggests that although the overall residual variance for this combination is higher the actual behaviour in the differential split sample test dsst is fairly similar this is an improvement in the behaviour compared to the q and lai data where the shift from the calibration front is large and in the direction of a reduced performance in the dsst fig 1 fig 10 4 2 information content and calibration success the information content of the data sets used for multi objective calibration differs affecting the final parameter estimation rode et al 2007 the pairing of daily gauged streamflow data with aggregated or averaged 8 day satellite vegetation data as undertaken in this study has been seen as problematic due to the lower reliability of satellite observations tang et al 2018 this study compared two types of satellite data lai and et with q to identify if one of the input sets is superior for improved model predictions the findings suggest that the q et data pairing is preferred as model performance is less likely to decline when validated suggesting more robust parameter estimation fig 10 this is likely due to et being a flux variable which better constrains the model vervoort et al 2014 4 3 testing environmental models the testing or validation of hydrological models is a well researched area catalysed by kleme≈° 1986 who provided a systematic framework within which a model could be tested the simplest test a split sample test sst is less often used than the more rigorous counterpart the differential split sample test dsst this tests the model ability to assess performance under conditions that vary from those during calibration coron et al 2012 gaborit et al 2015 refsgaard et al 2014 however the results of this study table 2 fig 6 fig 7 as well as those of xu 1999 show that a dsst generally occurs often unintentionally when data is split to form calibration and validation data sets in this study we actively tried to avoid non stationarity via the exclusion of a fire affected period but this still occurred because of climate variation table 5 fig 3 fig 6 fig 7 as environmental variation is observed on all time scales whether daily monthly or yearly descroix et al 2009 sch√§r et al 2004 sorooshian et al 1983 a true sst is almost impossible in observed environmental data sets from this it could be argued that the majority of model validation is more rigorous then intended and the commonly observed changed performance is explainable due to non stationarity in the data series the approach in this study comparing calibration pareto front and validation solutions builds on the earlier work tang et al 2018 vervoort et al 2014 indicating that multi objective calibration amplifies structural limitations in conceptual models this creates future opportunities for improving model structures and testing model structures such as combining with other approaches euser et al 2013 fenicia et al 2014 thirel et al 2015 in particular there are two directions that can be pursued for further development so far most of the earlier work to understand model structural or performance limitations has focused on just streamflow mostly using a multi metric approach euser et al 2013 fowler et al 2018a thirel et al 2015 it is clear from this study that using a multi variable approach and in particular using a combination of different flux variables offers the best option to identify behavioural issues in models a second approach is to extend the current analysis to a bayesian approach in combination with testing different model structures the parameter distributions identified from the best validation solution can be seen as a prior distribution for a further bayesian analysis tang et al 2018 of particular interest would be how the posterior parameter distributions would differ as a result of informative or non informative input data and as a function of model structure for example we would expect that models with a better representation of the et process would result in satellite et being a more informative input and thus result in more stable posterior distributions this is part of our ongoing work in this area 4 4 limitations and future work there are several limitations of this study notably the limited spatial and temporal scale a single catchment was the focus of this research so expanding the results beyond this especially to different biomes is not advised to extend this work it would be beneficial to apply the methodology to other areas with different weather patterns and vegetation types e g tropical rainforest grasslands the limited data availability a result of the span of the modis data and the large fire that impacted the majority of the catchment restricted the division into calibration and validation periods if additional data was available a second validation could be undertaken to assess if the 10 best parameter sets remained consistent during re validation a different approach could be to reverse the calibration and validation period to test this if the new superior points were to come from other points on the calibration front it would support the conclusion that no single area of the front can be identified to provide robust parameter sets for universal use as highlighted in the introduction spatially gridded models can take advantage of the spatial heterogeneity in the satellite data e g kundu et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 demb√©l√© et al 2020a demb√©l√© et al 2020b and soltani et al 2021 the lumped conceptual ecohydrological model in this study could not be fully leverage this in the same way as in a distributed model as the modis tiles were averaged future work building on this could be a model intercomparison breuer et al 2009 knoben et al 2020 li et al 2009 where several models lumped and distributed can be compared and generate pareto fronts however this will involve several further methodological questions including differences in model structures and the number of free parameters in the model the absolute and relative accuracy and uncertainties in the observed data streamflow satellite et and satellite lai was not explicitly considered in this study while there is little direct data to estimate the accuracy tomkins 2014 estimated the accuracy of streamflow gauging in australia and found uncertainties around 20 glenn et al 2011 reported similar uncertainties for satellite et estimates given that the main focus is the difference between the lai and et data sets the relative difference in uncertainty and accuracy could explain some of the differences in our study given that the lai and et satellite products were derived from the same satellite we assumed uncertainties were similar and therefore this effect was less than the other effects indicated earlier in the future other algorithms could be tested such as the pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search pa dds algorithm asadzadeh and tolson 2009 comparing the pareto front generated by different algorithms such as moscem and pa dds can further confirm the findings of this study i e the pareto front established during calibration does not hold up during validation 5 conclusion in a multi objective calibration the choice of data period the type of data flux versus state and the model structure all influence the resulting pareto front this research further strengthens two points in relation to multi objective calibration of conceptual models 1 the pareto front simply represents a distribution of equifinal solutions with only some of the solutions performing well on an independent validation data set and 2 it remains difficult to identify one optimal parameter set from pareto solutions in the end it is clear that we need a systematic approach to use multi objective calibration with two flux variables to improve

1863,microwave satellite remote sensing has enabled observations of soil moisture sm at the global scale and multiple sm data products have been developed in the past decades however single sensor based measurements are insufficient for continuous spatiotemporal coverage in the context of its climate program the climate change initiative the european space agency esa has developed robust long term global scale multi instrument satellite derived time series of climate data record for key component of the climate system including soil moisture cci while the soil moisture operational product system smops was specifically developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to offer the real time blended sm datasets through merging all available individual products before combining all individual sm data ingested into both smops and cci blended products are scaled to global land data assimilation system gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology benefiting from land surface model evolution and the availability of high quality forcing data gldas has become more comprehensive to track sm changes and dynamic trends the development of gldas and the scaling procedure in cci and smops leave an open scientific and operational question do the blended satellite sm data products have added value comparing to the gldas product this study clearly reveals that both cci and smops can provide the reliable sm observations with independent information although their climatology matches well with gldas relative to assimilation of gldas 0 10 cm sm data noah mp model can be further improved by assimilating the blended satellite sm observations with respect to the quality controlled in situ measurements the strong consistency of results presented in this paper proves that the blended satellite sm data products are more useful than the gldas product in terms of improving noah mp model performance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction through impacts on the partitioning of incoming radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes soil moisture sm plays a crucial role in the terrestrial water cycle energy balance and carbon exchange entekhabi et al 2010a dorigo et al 2017 the regional precipitation is commonly increased under surplus sm conditions while a lack of sm triggers drought occurrences koster et al 2004 brocca et al 2017 dorigo et al 2017 yin et al 2018 regional gradients in sm also affect plant growth through constraining biogeochemical cycles and plant transpiration and photosynthesis seneviratne et al 2010 accurate knowledge of the sm states is thus necessary for numerical weather forecasts as well as climate monitoring and predictions ground stations may well track sm changes and variability but they suffer from insufficient spatial coverage and inconsistencies at continental and global scales benefiting from decades of evolution land surface models lsms have become more comprehensive to provide spatiotemporally consistent sm estimates chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 these lsms need vegetation parameters to represent the partitioning of available radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes and soil heat exchanges yin et al 2016 similarly the soil hydraulic properties are widely used in the current lsms to represent moisture transport within the soil chen and dudhia 2001 niu et al 2011 however the soil hydraulic properties and vegetation parameters are traditionally set as constants and assigned from lookup tables that are determined by limited field experiments chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 these suboptimal parameter schemes increase errors of sm estimations shellito et al 2016 while the lsm simulations are subject to errors from meteorological forcing data and lack of scientific understanding in model physics reichle and koster 2004 peters lidard et al 2008 crow et al 2012 satellite land surface data products offer a great opportunity to improve lsm performance through providing global vegetation observations soil and elevation parameters and meteorological forcing data in order to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes the global land data assimilation system gldas on the basis of lsms was developed by national aeronautics and space administration nasa through combining satellite and ground based observations rodell et al 2004 benefiting from the observational precipitation and downward radiation products the gldas lsms typically including noah the community land model clm mosaic and the variable infiltration capacity model vic incorporate the optimal available analyses from atmospheric data assimilation systems and several satellite hydrological observations microwave satellite observations have opened a new era for spatially distributed measurements of sm at the global scale since the 1970s the soil dielectric constant linking sm and soil emissivity has a great impact on the microwave emission wang et al 1987 jackson and schmugge 1989 which allows to retrieve sm through either passive or active microwave satellite observations in a direct manner the passive technique uses a radiometer to receive the land surface emission affected by the physical and emissivity temperature of the earth while an active radar senses the land surface backscatter through transmitting electromagnetic pulses both passive and active microwave sensors can provide sm retrievals under nearly any weather conditions based on x band 8 0 12 0 ghz and c band 4 0 8 0 ghz microwave measurements recent satellite sm data products have included the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 amsr 2 onboard the global change observation mission water gcom w satellite maeda et al 2016 and windsat li et al 2010 as well as the advanced scatterometer ascat from meteorological operational platform metop a metop b and metop c satellite series wagner et al 2013 there are two more recent sensors that have been specifically designed to retrieve sm on basis of l band 1 0 2 0 ghz observations including the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010a these microwave satellite sm data products have footprints at typical resolutions from 25 to 50 km while their daily spatial coverages depend on the sensor characteristics including swath width and revisit time benefiting from the development of antenna reflector the current passive radiometers could achieve finer spatial resolution and higher coverage on the land surface brightness temperature with swath spanning from 900 km to 1450 km yin et al 2020 due to much more energy requirements however the active radar generally owns a relative narrower swath such as 550 km for ascat a b and c wagner et al 2013 higher frequencies shorter wavelengths microwave observations only represent sm status for shallow soil depth njoku et al 2003 wagner et al 2013 this weakness could be compensated for by l band frequency as used by smos and smap which can penetrate up to the top 5 cm soil depth kerr et al 2010 entekhabi et al 2010a besides lacking complete coverages in space and time and varying significantly from each other the individual satellite sm data products have their own characteristics and are archived in different formats therefore two blended satellite sm data products were developed to overcome the aforementioned single senor shortcomings one is from european space agency esa climate change initiative cci combining various individual passive and active microwave satellite data products to provide the climate sm data records from 1979 in support of climate research dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 another one is the soil moisture product system smops developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national environmental satellite data and information service nesds to meet the data requirements of national weather service nws smops uniquely offers a real time blended satellite data product with combining all currently available individual sm observations liu et al 2016 yin et al 2015a 2019 2020 before producing soil moisture cci combined hereafter cci and smops blended data products all available sm observations from the single sensors are scaled to gldas noah 0 10 cm sm climatology using cumulative distribution function cdf matching method dorigo et al 2017 yin et al 2015a 2019 2020 the scaling procedure leaves several open scientific and operational questions including 1 are the cci and smops products able to match well with gldas climatology 2 are there significant differences between the daily blended satellite sm data products and the daily gldas noah estimations for the 0 10 cm soil layer in such a manner that cci and smops can be treated as independent data sources 3 do the blended satellite sm data products have added value comparing to the gldas product in this paper we attempt to bridge these knowledge gaps through intercomparing the noah multi parameterization noah mp model performance with benefits of assimilating gldas noah 0 10 cm sm estimations and the cci and smops blended microwave satellite sm data products in the following section the data sets used in this paper will be briefly described designs of data assimilation da strategy and evaluation methods will be provided in section 3 a thorough understanding of multiyear averages is important to evaluate cci and smops climatology with treating the gldas as a benchmark differences in daily changes and dynamic trends are crucial to identify the quality distinctions between gldas estimations and the blended satellite sm data products inter comparisons between gldas and either cci or smops as well as noah mp model skill improvements from assimilating the blended satellite observations are then highlighted in section 4 attributes of the inter comparisons and data assimilation results will be discussed in section 5 finally all results of this study will be briefly summarized in section 6 2 data sources 2 1 gldas soil moisture in order to produce reliable land surface fields in near real time the gldas was developed jointly by nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep it provides global hydrological estimates through combining lsm simulations with the new generation of ground and space based satellite observations rodell et al 2004 li et al 2015 gldas lsms including clm vic noah and mosaic are driven by observations based precipitation and downward radiation products to reduce the uncertainties from the forcing data benefiting from incorporating satellite land surface data products such as leaf area index sm surface temperature snow cover and snow water equivalent the current operational gldas produces optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes with uniquely unionizing the qualities of global high resolution near real time and offline terrestrial modeling system rodell et al 2004 the gldas provides 3 hourly and monthly land surface state such as sm evaporation and soil temperature li et al 2015 specifically gldas v2 1 noah 3 hourly data product at 0 25 spatial resolution is the main production stream on basis of noah version 3 6 v3 6 it provides 36 land surface fields from january 2000 to present with about 1 5 month latency the noah model was forced by atmospheric analysis data from noaa global data assimilation system gdas daily analysis precipitation fields from the disaggregated global precipitation climatology project and the air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modeling system radiation datasets huffman et al 2001 adler et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 the 3 hourly gldas v2 1 noah model outputs contain 0 25 sm estimations for 0 10 cm soil layer from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 reprocessed to daily time steps for this study 2 2 esa cci combined soil moisture data product soil moisture climate data records are fundamental for comprehensively understanding long term changes of water and energy balances considering the individual satellite missions are inhibited by short mission lives and limited historical data having a number of independent satellite sm data products does not guarantee it is straight forward to create long term consistent time series for climate change studies the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc has thus delegated to the global climate observing system gcos to define what are the essential climate variables ecvs as a direct response to the unfccc needs in observations esa has set up the climate change initiative cci program that currently has 29 projects developing 27 ecvs including soil moisture https climate esa int en combining individual satellite observations into a blended sm dataset can start from either level 1 brightness temperature and backscatter coefficients or level 2 sm retrievals the long term soil moisture cci data product was developed by merging current and past satellite sm observation preimesberger et al 2021 three fusion products in the esa cci include active passive and combined soil moisture observations dorigo et al 2017 based on a nearest neighbor search method sm retrievals from all available single sensors are first mapped to a daily time step and then passive and active sm data products are scaled to amsr and ascat observations using the cdf matching method respectively liu et al 2011 dorigo et al 2017 in esa cci v04 5 the passive product combines the individual satellite sm observations from scanning multichannel microwave radiometer ssmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm microwave imager tmi windsat radiometer amsr e amsr 2 and smos while the active data include sm observations from active microwave instrument ami ascat a and ascat b in order to generate the combined v04 5 datasets both of the fusion active and passive data products were rescaled to gldas v2 1 noah sm climatology for 0 10 cm soil layer to avoid the climatological differences between active and passive sm retrievals preimesberger et al 2021 weights for passive and active data were derived from signal to noise estimates on basis of triple collocation dorigo et al 2017 preimesberger et al 2020 specifically individual sm retrievals including ascat a ascat b amsr 2 and smos were remapped to 0 25 spatial resolution and then ingested into the esa cci combined v04 5 over the 1 april 2015 31 december 2018 time period table 1 with quality control using the snow and frozen ground flags 2 3 smops blended soil moisture data product noaa requires high quality satellite sm observations with short latency to improve the accuracy of ncep numeric weather prediction nwp models and national water model nwm at the national water center nwc satellite sm data products from individual satellite sensors not only vary significantly from spatial resolution data quality and archiving file format but also suffer from long latency period and insufficient spatiotemporal coverage to meet the operational users requirements the smops was thus developed at noaa nesdis to produce a blended product of sm retrievals from all available microwave satellite sensors liu et al 2016 yin et al 2014 2015a 2019 2020 after the first version officially released in 2010 the smops data product has been updated twice with considerations to the users feedbacks through improving retrieval algorithms removing old satellite platforms and including new sensors yin et al 2019 2020 specifically smops v3 0 table 1 provides microwave remotely sensed sm data products from ascat a ascat b amsr 2 smos and smap yin et al 2019 2020 the nwp models at noaa ncep need real time satellite sm retrievals arriving within the 6 hour cut off time in order to seamlessly and conveniently provide data to the ncep and nwc smops retrieves sm data from the level 1 brightness temperature observations to make directly available with the shortest possible turn around time zhan et al 2016 the single channel retrieval scr algorithm jackson 1993 is used in smops to produce amsr 2 smos and smap near real time soil moisture retrievals brightness temperature observations from either c or l band of those sensors are converted to emissivity in the scr algorithm and in turn to be corrected by vegetation information and surface roughness jackson 1993 given the dielectric constant determined by the fresnel equation a dielectric mixing model is then used to retrieve the sm liu et al 2016 as ascat a and ascat b data products are produced and distributed in real time by the vienna university of technology via eumetsat european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites operationally wagner et al 2013 the ascat level 2 relative soil moisture data are converted to the volumetric sm using a soil type map liu et al 2016 zhan et al 2016 smops combines all the individual sm retrievals to a blended data layer with better spatial coverage for each 6 hour time period or each day which makes the smops unique yin et al 2019 2020 before the combination all sm observations from individual sensors are remapped to smops 0 25 latitude longitude grids and then scaled to gldas v2 1 noah sm climatology of the 0 10 cm soil layer using the cdf matching method yin et al 2019 2020 the 6 hourly and daily smops blended products are produced by merging all individual sm retrievals acquired within the previous 6 hour and 24 hour windows yin et al 2019 in this paper the daily 0 25 smops v3 0 sm data from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 are quality controlled using the snow and frozen ground flags 2 4 scan soil moisture observations based on the experience of running a national sm and soil temperature pilot project the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the u s department of agriculture usda designed the soil climate analysis network scan to enable in situ observations by overcoming problems including incomplete short term limited areas of coverage and nonstandard sensor arrays schaefer et al 2007 starting in 1999 the standard scan station configuration focuses on the agricultural areas of the u s in support of natural resources assessment it consists of over 200 stations with hourly sm observations automatically recorded by measuring the soil dielectric constant for the sensors hourly scan soil moisture and temperature data are available at national water and climate center home page https www wcc nrcs usda gov scan in this paper scan observations from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 were reprocessed to match the daily time step of noah mp model outputs sm observations either outside of the physically possible range or under frozen conditions on basis of scan soil temperature data were excluded as part of the quality control strategy liu et al 2011 yin et al 2015c after excluding scan sites that provide fewer than 100 day of sm observations there are a total of 155 and 146 sites were chosen in the conus to validate noah mp model 0 10 cm and 40 100 cm sm estimations 3 methods 3 1 noah mp model the noah lsm is an important component of the nwp models for operational weather and climate predations and has been widely used by the noaa ncep chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 however limitations of noah include a combined land surface layer of soil and vegetation a bulk layer of snow and soil using top 5 cm soil texture to represent the entire 200 cm soil column and a weak impeding effect of frozen soil on infiltration and river discharge niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 noah mp was thus developed to address the aforementioned problems through enhancing vegetation phenology frozen soil and infiltration the vegetation canopy energy balance the layered snowpack and sm groundwater interaction and related runoff production niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 compared to noah land surface model the new features in noah mp primarily include modification of two stream radiation transfer scheme to consider the 3 dimension canopy implementation of semi tile vegetation and bare soil and application of interactive energy balance to estimate the canopy skin temperature niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 in this paper the noah mp model v3 6 implemented in the nasa land surface system lis v7 2 kumar et al 2006 2008 peters lidard et al 2011 was employed to intercompare assimilations of gldas 0 10 cm and the blended satellite sm estimations 3 2 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter enkf has been widely used in sequential sm data assimilation evensen 1994 kumar et al 2009 yin et al 2014 2015b in an enkf based da system the ensemble forecast and state variable update steps are alternated by a monte carlo approximation of a sequential bayesian filtering process evensen 1994 the ensemble is typically created by adding gaussian noises to forcing and or state variables with assuming that the ensemble perturbation cannot directly affect the mean model performance ryu et al 2009 the model states y for each ensemble member propagated forward in the forecast step is expressed as 1 y t y t k x t h y t where k h and x vectors are the kalman gain matrix the observation operator and the sm observations respectively the observation operator primarily depends on the observation vectors while the kalman gain matrix is given by 2 k Œ∂ y t h t t h t Œ∂ y t h t t Œ∂ x t where Œ∂ x t indicates error variance for observations while Œ∂ y t is forecast error variance determined by ensemble spread specifically the error variances for gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations as well as smops and esa cci blended sm data products were set as 3 as lis examples kumar et al 2009 the ensemble size was 12 which is the optimal ensemble size in a sequential sm assimilation system yin et al 2015b to update noah mp model states for all da cases and the open loop run perturbation for meteorological forcing parameters and state variables table 2 were applied each individual 1 hr noah mp model time step 3 3 data assimilation strategies the enkf is an optimal da technique if 1 satellite observation errors follow gaussian distribution 2 satellite observations are linearly related to the model simulations and 3 model state errors are also jointly gaussian distributed given almost always biased to model simulations satellite sm observations are generally bias corrected to model simulations in order to satisfy the assumptions kumar et al 2012 nearing et al 2013 yin and zhan 2018 thus the noah mp v3 6 was initially run with the unperturbed meteorological forcing data and model state variables to generate a 0 10 cm sm climatology for the bias correction in this stage the noah mp v3 6 lsm was spun up by cycling 30 times through the period from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 and then the simulations were conducted over the same period with 1 hour time step inputs and daily outputs gldas and the both blended satellite sm estimations were then scaled to the noah mp model 0 10 cm sm climatology using the cdf matching method that has a better spatiotemporal stratification kumar et al 2012 yin and zhan 2018 based on the bias corrected gldas noah v2 1 cci and smops sm datasets the experiment structure was designed to include an open loop run and three da cases specifically 1 the open loop run olp represents the noah mp model runs with the perturbed meteorological forcing data and model state variables table 2 which indicates model simulations under suboptimal forcing conditions the olp run is not benefited by da 2 the da cases were set as assimilation of the bias corrected gldas cci and smops soil moisture estimations into the olp run this means they are forced by the same perturbed meteorological forcing data and model states used in the olp run table 2 and in turn to highlight that the differences between da cases and the olp run are good metrics to evaluate the da impacts in this paper dagld assimilates the gldas sm simulations for 0 10 cm soil layer while dacci and dasmp assimilate the esa cci and smops blended sm data products respectively given the same forcing data model parameters bias correction strategy and perturbation strategies in the same enkf based da system differences among dagld dacci and dasmp are caused only by assimilating the different sm estimations the noah mp lsm with setting ensemble size as 12 was spun up by cycling 20 times through the period from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 the olp run and the three da cases were then conducted at 0 25 spatial resolution on a gridded near global domain from 60 s 180 w to 90 n 180 e over the same period with 1 hour time step inputs and daily outputs the gldas and the both blended satellite sm data were assimilated into the noah mp lsm at each 00 00z through providing the updated 0 10 cm sm condition all noah mp model simulations in this study were forced by precipitation downward longwave and shortwave radiation near surface humidity and wind as well as surface pressure from the global data assimilation system derber et al 1991 3 4 model performance measurements the choice of metrics for measuring model performance mainly depends on the sm nature and characteristics a single metric is sensitive to a specific characteristic and thus not able to well obtain the sm attributes entekhabi et al 2010b in this paper a comprehensive assessment on noah mp model performance was thus conducted using tow widely used metrics including unbiased rmse ubrmse and correlation coefficient r based on the quality controlled scan observations Œ∏ scan the noah mp model sm simulations Œ∏ model for the grid j i are assessed by 3 r j i k 1 n Œ∏ scan k Œ∏ scan Œ∏ model k Œ∏ model k 1 n Œ∏ scan k Œ∏ scan 2 k 1 n Œ∏ model k Œ∏ model 2 4 ubrmse j i i 1 n Œ∏ scan i Œ∏ scan Œ∏ model i Œ∏ model 2 n 1 in this paper the sample size n is 1371 for each grid since there are 1371 days during the period from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 the overbar denotes the averages during the study period similarly the differences between the blended satellite and gldas Œ∏ gldas sm estimations are measured by root mean square error difference rmsd 6 rmsd k 1 n Œ∏ satellite k Œ∏ gldas k 2 n 1 where Œ∏ satellite indicates either smops or esa cci blended sm data products that are available during the study period 4 results 4 1 climatology of gldas and blended satellite soil moisture data products all individual satellite sm observations are scaled to gldas 0 10 cm climatology before they are ingested into smops and cci blended products the smops and cci climatologies are thus first evaluated by comparing with multi year averaged gldas simulations figure 1 shows the temporal averaged cci and smops data products versus the gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations over the global domain from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 the higher sample density area in red color being closer to the black line represents the blended satellite sm observations and gldas simulations match better whereas the lower sample density area shading in the blue color is departure from the ideal regression curve compared to the gldas the multiyear averaged cci shows wetter patterns on the entire global domain figure 1a relatively the smops climatology presents drier patterns in dry areas while exhibiting wetter patterns in the wet areas than the gldas figure 1b with respect to the gldas climatology the correlation coefficients r for cci and smops are 0 871 and 0 921 respectively the good correlations imply that the climatology of both blended satellite sm data products match well with the gldas climatology it also suggests that all individual satellite sm data products ingested into both cci and smops have been successfully scaled to the gldas climatology which allows to reasonably combine them together to produce the blended sm datasets 4 2 differences between gldas and blended satellite soil moisture data products a pair of widely used metrics including correlation coefficient and rmsd are used to evaluate the differences between gldas and the blended satellite sm data products figure 2 shows temporal correlation coefficients between the daily gldas 0 10 sm simulations and the daily cci and smops observations from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 areas shading in red blue color in figures 2a 2b indicates higher lower correlation coefficients the esa cci shows strong consistency with the gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations primarily in the eastern south america india australia sub sahara and the southern africa while low correlations are found in the middle high latitude areas of the north hemisphere figure 2a relatively smops presents weaker agreement with the gldas simulations in not only the high latitude but also middle low latitude areas figure 2b the larger correlation values for smops are mainly found in the sub sahara india and the eastern south america with respect to the gldas the zonal averaged correlation coefficients zacs for cci and smops exhibit lower values less than 0 2 from 40 n to 80 n both cci and smops present greater zacs in the 40 40 n areas where the zacs for cci and smops are spanning 0 4 0 75 and 0 3 0 55 respectively compared to the smops blended sm product the zacs esa cci is higher by about 0 2 in the belt areas located in 40 15 n and 25 35 n relative to the patterns for climatology in figure 1 the gldas based correlation coefficients for multiyear averaged cci and smops are remarkably decreased by their daily dynamics it suggests that the dynamic trends for the both blended satellite sm data products are hardly affected by the scaling procedure before combination besides the correlation coefficient the rmsd is used as another metric to measure the differences between gldas simulations and the blended satellite sm observations figure 3 shows temporal rmsds between the daily gldas simulations and the daily blended satellite sm data products from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 area shading in red color in figures 3a 3b indicates the gldas based rmsd is greater while in blue color means smaller differences with respect to the daily gldas sm simulations for 0 10 cm soil layer the cci primarily exhibits larger rmsd values 0 10 m3 m3 in the high latitude areas figure 3a relatively the smops blended sm data product presents greater gldas based rmsds on the entire global domain figure 3b besides of the high latitude areas the greater rmsd values can also be found in the west conus south america the central africa and the south asia with respect to the gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations the zonal averaged rmsds for cci are spanning from 0 04 to 0 055 m3 m3 in the 50 40 n areas while can reach to 0 09 m3 m3 in the high latitude areas figure 3c the greater differences between the daily smops and gldas can be found in the belt areas located in 45 65 n which can reach to 0 1 m3 m3 the rmsd values for smops basically range from 0 05 m3 m3 to 0 08 m3 m3 in the remaining areas these results suggest that both cci and smops data products can be treated as independent data sources although the individual sm observations ingested into them are scaled to gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology 4 3 validation on da cases with scan observations figures 4 a 4c show the scan observations based ubrmses for noah mp model 0 10 cm sm simulations from the three da cases scan sites in blue color highlight lower ubrmse values whereas in red color mean the da cases perform modest with respect to the quality controlled scan measurements noah mp model with benefits of data assimilation shows a reasonable performance in the west and east conus with the ubrmse values below 0 05 m3 m3 however large errors for the da cases are primarily found in the mississippi river areas and the south conus which can reach to 0 1 m3 m3 based on the same state variables and meteorological forcing data inter comparisons among the three da cases are presented in figures 4d 4f compared to dagld dacci shows better performance in the great plain areas whereas the degradations caused by assimilating cci can be found in the northwestern conus with respect to the scan sm observations noah mp model shows a better behavior with benefits of assimilating the smops sm data product in the central western conus in comparison with the dagld while no significant degradations are found on the entire conus domain both dacci and dasmp perform similar with the dasmp showing lower ubrmse values in the northwest areas figures 4g 4i present the differences in scan measurements based ubrmses for the noah mp model sm simulations in the top soil layer between with and without da benefits sites in blue color indicate improvement whereas those in the warm color indicate degradation benefiting from assimilation of gldas and the blended satellite sm estimations significant improvements on noah mp model performance are found in the western and the central eastern conus yet the degradations for the three da cases can be seen in the great plain areas specifically the conus domain averaged ubrmse for olp is 0 0533 m3 m3 which can be significantly decreased by 0 0011 m3 m3 2 11 reduction 0 0012 m3 m3 2 30 reduction and 0 0018 m3 m3 3 50 reduction by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 compared to the dagld noah mp performance could be further improved by assimilating cci and smops blended sm data products figures 5 a 5c show the scan observations based ubrmses for noah mp model 40 100 cm sm simulations from the three da cases the behavior of noah mp model sm simulations for the topsoil layer are completely mirrored in the deeper soil layer the three da cases present good performance in west and east conus areas with the ubrmse below 0 05 m3 m3 whereas exhibit large uncertainties 0 1 m3 m3 in the mississippi river areas and the south conus it can be found that ubrmses for dagld are tremendously reduced by dacci in the central and west conus areas figure 5d however the dacci show degradations in the south conus in comparison with the dagld which can be significantly improved by the dasmp compared to dagld dasmp presents significant improvement on noah mp model sm simulations for 40 100 cm soil layer in the central western areas while no significant degradations are found on the entire conus domain figure 5e relative to dacci dasmp exhibits lower ubrmses on the conus domain except the upper mississippi river and the south conus areas figure 5f the positive signals from the surface soil layer are reasonably vertically propagated to the deeper soil layer figures 5g 5i with respect to the quality controlled scan measurements ubrmses for olp run are significantly decreased with benefits of assimilating gldas sm estimations in the south and east conus both dacci and dasmp exhibit lower ubrmses on the entire conus domain except few sites scattering in north and south areas in comparison with olp run statistical results show that the conus domain averaged ubrmse for olp run is 0 0588 m3 m3 which can be significantly decreased by 0 0016 m3 m3 2 80 reduction 0 0025 m3 m3 4 44 reduction and 0 0038 m3 m3 6 90 reduction by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 compared to the dagld noah mp model sm simulations for 40 100 cm soil layer are further improved by 1 6 and 4 by assimilating cci and smops sm data products respectively table 3 the second metric is the correlation coefficient r that is commonly used to measure the dynamic trends between model simulations and ground observations figure 6 shows differences in correlation coefficients among dagld dacci and dasmp cases with blue red indicating robust positive negative agreements the dacci is more successful to respect the scan sm observations in the great plain and the east conus areas in comparison with the dagld whereas shows weaker correlations for the scan sites scattering in the northwest and south areas relatively dasmp exhibits less degradations over the dagld while presenting a relative stronger consistent with in situ observations in the central and west conus areas it is very interesting to find that the dasmp presents a more robust agreement in west conus in comparison with the dacci compared to dasmp however dacci has a better behavior in the mississippi river areas the conus domain averaged correlation coefficient for the olp run is 0 549 which is significantly increased by 0 015 2 66 increase 0 017 3 00 increase and 0 026 4 52 increase by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 with respect to the in situ observations noah mp model with benefits of assimilating either cci or smops data product can more reasonably track 0 10 cm sm changes in comparison with assimilation of gldas estimations compared to the top soil layer larger differences in correlation coefficients among dagld dacci and dasmp cases are found for the sm simulations in 40 100 cm soil layer figure 7 statistical results reveal that the dacci is more successfully to track sm dynamic trends over the dagld in the mississippi river and the west conus areas compared to dagld dasmp is more consistent with the quality controlled scan sm measurements on the entire conus domain except few degraded sites over the central and west areas relative to the dacci the dasmp case is more robust agreement with scan observations in the northwest and southeast areas yet shows weaker correlations in the southwest and upper mississippi river areas the conus domain averaged correlation coefficient for the olp run is 0 198 which is significantly increased by 0 039 16 46 increase 0 049 19 84 increase and 0 071 26 39 increase by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 with respect to the scan observations noah mp model with benefits of assimilating the blended satellite sm data products can more successfully track 40 100 cm sm dynamic trends in comparison with assimilation of gldas estimations 4 4 discussion results in section 4 0 indicate that cci and smops blended satellite data products can well match with gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology but there are significant differences in daily dynamic trends and changes between gldas and satellite observations as a result noah mp model can be further improved by assimilating either cci or smops in comparison with assimilation of gldas sm further considerations relevant to the investigations are discussed here associated with data characteristics advantages of satellite observations and complementary evaluations 4 5 spatial distributions before ingesting into the cci and smops all individual retrievals are scaled to the gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology as a result the multiyear averaged cci and smops sm data products match well with the gldas climatology figure 1 however the large differences between the daily gldas simulations and the daily blended satellite observations can still be found figures 2 3 which allow to treat both of the cci and smops as the independent data sources interannual variations over the 2015 2018 period indicate that gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations are wetter in the u s canada and europe figure 8 in cold season january april than warm season june september which are the opposite to the seasonal variations of precipitation adler et al 2017 compared to gldas cci shows a reasonable spatial distribution with narrowing the differences in season averaged sm values between the cold and warm seasons whereas the opposite interannual variations can still be found in the conus figure 8 relatively interannual variations of smops present a more reasonable spatial distribution in the north hemisphere it exhibits a dryer pattern in cold season while the wetter smops observations can be found in warm season figure 8 these results suggest that the blended satellite observations provide sm information in an independent manner although they even after being re scaled with respect to the gldas climatology as a result the problems of interannual variations in the gldas could be addressed by the cci and smops to better meet the users requirements the developers of soil moisture cci and smops have given a top priority to develop the model free blended soil moisture data products madelon et al 2022 yin et al 2022 given the gldas model errors the individual satellite sm retrievals could be scaled to the l band microwave remote sensing soil moisture observations madelon et al 2022 yin et al 2022 as a result the model free blended satellite sm observations are more successful tracking the surface soil moisture status in comparison with the gldas climatology based data products madelon et al 2022 yin et al 2022 assimilation of the model free blended satellite sm data products is expected to further improve the noah mp performance in the future 4 6 advantages of esa cci and smops synchronous comparisons are generally used to evaluate model and satellite sm estimations with respect to the in situ observations inter comparisons in this way are more direct but subjected to the distinguished differences in sample size determined by data availability yin et al 2019 gldas has a fully spatiotemporal coverage which is much better than cci and smops data product as a result direct comparisons between gldas simulations and satellite observations probably tend to promote smops and cci in an unfair way we thus designed an experiment to comprehensively intercompare noah mp model skills benefiting from assimilation of gldas and the two blended microwave sm data products based on the same meteorological forcing data and model structure noah mp model simulations for the three da cases under the same parameterization and perturbation conditions allow to highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages for those data products assimilated into the olp run noah mp running for dacci and dasmp cases becomes an open loop when the blended satellite sm observations are unavailable given the gldas has a fully spatiotemporal coverage noah mp is supposed to have a better performance with benefits of assimilating the gldas 0 10 cm sm estimations in this paper however statics clearly document that both dacci and dasmp are more successful to respect in situ observations in compassion with dagld this indicates that cci and smops sm data products could provide more accurate information over the gldas even though gldas has a higher data availability in an enkf based da system model simulations are corrected toward the satellite observations and in turn to propagate model states forward in the forecast step yin et al 2014 2015b there are still considerable uncertainties associated seasonal and interannual variations figure 8 in gldas sm simulations although several satellite hydrological observations are used to drive the gldas models rodell et al 2004 this open scientific problem and challenge could be addressed by satellite sm observations benefiting the reasonable spatial patterns noah mp model performance is further improved by dacci and dasmp in this paper compared to the dagld noah mp model sm simulations with benefits of the smops and cci blended sm observations show a better performance with respect to the in situ observations figures 4 9 4 7 inter comparisons of assimilating cci and smops compared to cci smops shows greater differences in gldas based correlation coefficients figure 2 and rmsd values figure 3 over the global domain according to figure 8 however the interannual variations for the smops are more reasonable in comparison with the cci this means satellite observations could provide more reliable sm data in comparison with gldas simulations although the latter one has a great performance with respect to the gldas more significant differences can probably guarantee that much less useful information from satellite observations is lost in the scaling procedure relative to cci smops is more successful to respect the gldas climatology but more independent to track sm changes and dynamic trends as a result the dasmp has a better behavior in comparison with the dacci the spatiotemporal coverage for cci has been significantly improved by the increasing number of available sensors in recent years dorigo et al 2017 and its zonal average can thus reach to 70 90 the esa cci combined v04 5 includes individual sm observations from ascat a ascat b smos and amsr 2 from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 table 1 relatively one more individual data product smap was ingested into the smops blended sm over the same period table 1 as a result many gaps remained by the cci can be filled by the smops wang et al 2021 as the latter one has a 90 95 spatiotemporal coverage over the global domain yin et al 2019 with respect to the ground observations the smap presents a good behavior with lower errors in comparison with the current individual sm data products burgin et al 2017 ingesting the smap can thus promote the smops performance and in turn to benefit the dasmp 4 8 conclusions the esa cci and noaa smops are only two blended satellite sm products before the combination all individual satellite observations ingested into cci and smops are scaled to gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology using the cdf matching method this study reveals that there is still a need to develop the blended remotely sensed sm data products although gldas has a reasonable performance with benefits from lsm evolution forcing data improvement and parameterization promotion specifically the noah mp model benefiting from assimilation of gldas simulations for the 0 10 cm soil layer was inter compared with advances of assimilating cci and smops blended sm data products with respect to the quality controlled in situ observations a comprehensive assessment using ubrmse correlation coefficient is conducted to measure the metrics of the three da cases the key results obtained in this paper include both cci and smops can well match gldas climatology as the individual satellite observations are scaled to gldas before the combination with respect to the gldas climatology the correlation coefficients for the cci and smops are 0 871 and 0 921 respectively but both cci and smops can be treated as independent data sources as the low correlation coefficients and large rmsd values between the daily gldas and the daily blended satellite sm estimations noah mp lsm performance can be significantly improved by assimilating gldas cci and smops the improvements can be found for not only the top soil layer but also deep soil layer with reducing unrmse values and increasing the correlations with respect to the quality controlled scan sm measurements relative to assimilation of gldas 0 10 cm estimations noah mp model simulations with benefits of assimilating cci and smops are more successful to track sm changes and dynamic trends with respect to in situ

1863,microwave satellite remote sensing has enabled observations of soil moisture sm at the global scale and multiple sm data products have been developed in the past decades however single sensor based measurements are insufficient for continuous spatiotemporal coverage in the context of its climate program the climate change initiative the european space agency esa has developed robust long term global scale multi instrument satellite derived time series of climate data record for key component of the climate system including soil moisture cci while the soil moisture operational product system smops was specifically developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to offer the real time blended sm datasets through merging all available individual products before combining all individual sm data ingested into both smops and cci blended products are scaled to global land data assimilation system gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology benefiting from land surface model evolution and the availability of high quality forcing data gldas has become more comprehensive to track sm changes and dynamic trends the development of gldas and the scaling procedure in cci and smops leave an open scientific and operational question do the blended satellite sm data products have added value comparing to the gldas product this study clearly reveals that both cci and smops can provide the reliable sm observations with independent information although their climatology matches well with gldas relative to assimilation of gldas 0 10 cm sm data noah mp model can be further improved by assimilating the blended satellite sm observations with respect to the quality controlled in situ measurements the strong consistency of results presented in this paper proves that the blended satellite sm data products are more useful than the gldas product in terms of improving noah mp model performance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction through impacts on the partitioning of incoming radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes soil moisture sm plays a crucial role in the terrestrial water cycle energy balance and carbon exchange entekhabi et al 2010a dorigo et al 2017 the regional precipitation is commonly increased under surplus sm conditions while a lack of sm triggers drought occurrences koster et al 2004 brocca et al 2017 dorigo et al 2017 yin et al 2018 regional gradients in sm also affect plant growth through constraining biogeochemical cycles and plant transpiration and photosynthesis seneviratne et al 2010 accurate knowledge of the sm states is thus necessary for numerical weather forecasts as well as climate monitoring and predictions ground stations may well track sm changes and variability but they suffer from insufficient spatial coverage and inconsistencies at continental and global scales benefiting from decades of evolution land surface models lsms have become more comprehensive to provide spatiotemporally consistent sm estimates chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 these lsms need vegetation parameters to represent the partitioning of available radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes and soil heat exchanges yin et al 2016 similarly the soil hydraulic properties are widely used in the current lsms to represent moisture transport within the soil chen and dudhia 2001 niu et al 2011 however the soil hydraulic properties and vegetation parameters are traditionally set as constants and assigned from lookup tables that are determined by limited field experiments chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 these suboptimal parameter schemes increase errors of sm estimations shellito et al 2016 while the lsm simulations are subject to errors from meteorological forcing data and lack of scientific understanding in model physics reichle and koster 2004 peters lidard et al 2008 crow et al 2012 satellite land surface data products offer a great opportunity to improve lsm performance through providing global vegetation observations soil and elevation parameters and meteorological forcing data in order to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes the global land data assimilation system gldas on the basis of lsms was developed by national aeronautics and space administration nasa through combining satellite and ground based observations rodell et al 2004 benefiting from the observational precipitation and downward radiation products the gldas lsms typically including noah the community land model clm mosaic and the variable infiltration capacity model vic incorporate the optimal available analyses from atmospheric data assimilation systems and several satellite hydrological observations microwave satellite observations have opened a new era for spatially distributed measurements of sm at the global scale since the 1970s the soil dielectric constant linking sm and soil emissivity has a great impact on the microwave emission wang et al 1987 jackson and schmugge 1989 which allows to retrieve sm through either passive or active microwave satellite observations in a direct manner the passive technique uses a radiometer to receive the land surface emission affected by the physical and emissivity temperature of the earth while an active radar senses the land surface backscatter through transmitting electromagnetic pulses both passive and active microwave sensors can provide sm retrievals under nearly any weather conditions based on x band 8 0 12 0 ghz and c band 4 0 8 0 ghz microwave measurements recent satellite sm data products have included the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 amsr 2 onboard the global change observation mission water gcom w satellite maeda et al 2016 and windsat li et al 2010 as well as the advanced scatterometer ascat from meteorological operational platform metop a metop b and metop c satellite series wagner et al 2013 there are two more recent sensors that have been specifically designed to retrieve sm on basis of l band 1 0 2 0 ghz observations including the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010a these microwave satellite sm data products have footprints at typical resolutions from 25 to 50 km while their daily spatial coverages depend on the sensor characteristics including swath width and revisit time benefiting from the development of antenna reflector the current passive radiometers could achieve finer spatial resolution and higher coverage on the land surface brightness temperature with swath spanning from 900 km to 1450 km yin et al 2020 due to much more energy requirements however the active radar generally owns a relative narrower swath such as 550 km for ascat a b and c wagner et al 2013 higher frequencies shorter wavelengths microwave observations only represent sm status for shallow soil depth njoku et al 2003 wagner et al 2013 this weakness could be compensated for by l band frequency as used by smos and smap which can penetrate up to the top 5 cm soil depth kerr et al 2010 entekhabi et al 2010a besides lacking complete coverages in space and time and varying significantly from each other the individual satellite sm data products have their own characteristics and are archived in different formats therefore two blended satellite sm data products were developed to overcome the aforementioned single senor shortcomings one is from european space agency esa climate change initiative cci combining various individual passive and active microwave satellite data products to provide the climate sm data records from 1979 in support of climate research dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 another one is the soil moisture product system smops developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national environmental satellite data and information service nesds to meet the data requirements of national weather service nws smops uniquely offers a real time blended satellite data product with combining all currently available individual sm observations liu et al 2016 yin et al 2015a 2019 2020 before producing soil moisture cci combined hereafter cci and smops blended data products all available sm observations from the single sensors are scaled to gldas noah 0 10 cm sm climatology using cumulative distribution function cdf matching method dorigo et al 2017 yin et al 2015a 2019 2020 the scaling procedure leaves several open scientific and operational questions including 1 are the cci and smops products able to match well with gldas climatology 2 are there significant differences between the daily blended satellite sm data products and the daily gldas noah estimations for the 0 10 cm soil layer in such a manner that cci and smops can be treated as independent data sources 3 do the blended satellite sm data products have added value comparing to the gldas product in this paper we attempt to bridge these knowledge gaps through intercomparing the noah multi parameterization noah mp model performance with benefits of assimilating gldas noah 0 10 cm sm estimations and the cci and smops blended microwave satellite sm data products in the following section the data sets used in this paper will be briefly described designs of data assimilation da strategy and evaluation methods will be provided in section 3 a thorough understanding of multiyear averages is important to evaluate cci and smops climatology with treating the gldas as a benchmark differences in daily changes and dynamic trends are crucial to identify the quality distinctions between gldas estimations and the blended satellite sm data products inter comparisons between gldas and either cci or smops as well as noah mp model skill improvements from assimilating the blended satellite observations are then highlighted in section 4 attributes of the inter comparisons and data assimilation results will be discussed in section 5 finally all results of this study will be briefly summarized in section 6 2 data sources 2 1 gldas soil moisture in order to produce reliable land surface fields in near real time the gldas was developed jointly by nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep it provides global hydrological estimates through combining lsm simulations with the new generation of ground and space based satellite observations rodell et al 2004 li et al 2015 gldas lsms including clm vic noah and mosaic are driven by observations based precipitation and downward radiation products to reduce the uncertainties from the forcing data benefiting from incorporating satellite land surface data products such as leaf area index sm surface temperature snow cover and snow water equivalent the current operational gldas produces optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes with uniquely unionizing the qualities of global high resolution near real time and offline terrestrial modeling system rodell et al 2004 the gldas provides 3 hourly and monthly land surface state such as sm evaporation and soil temperature li et al 2015 specifically gldas v2 1 noah 3 hourly data product at 0 25 spatial resolution is the main production stream on basis of noah version 3 6 v3 6 it provides 36 land surface fields from january 2000 to present with about 1 5 month latency the noah model was forced by atmospheric analysis data from noaa global data assimilation system gdas daily analysis precipitation fields from the disaggregated global precipitation climatology project and the air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modeling system radiation datasets huffman et al 2001 adler et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 the 3 hourly gldas v2 1 noah model outputs contain 0 25 sm estimations for 0 10 cm soil layer from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 reprocessed to daily time steps for this study 2 2 esa cci combined soil moisture data product soil moisture climate data records are fundamental for comprehensively understanding long term changes of water and energy balances considering the individual satellite missions are inhibited by short mission lives and limited historical data having a number of independent satellite sm data products does not guarantee it is straight forward to create long term consistent time series for climate change studies the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc has thus delegated to the global climate observing system gcos to define what are the essential climate variables ecvs as a direct response to the unfccc needs in observations esa has set up the climate change initiative cci program that currently has 29 projects developing 27 ecvs including soil moisture https climate esa int en combining individual satellite observations into a blended sm dataset can start from either level 1 brightness temperature and backscatter coefficients or level 2 sm retrievals the long term soil moisture cci data product was developed by merging current and past satellite sm observation preimesberger et al 2021 three fusion products in the esa cci include active passive and combined soil moisture observations dorigo et al 2017 based on a nearest neighbor search method sm retrievals from all available single sensors are first mapped to a daily time step and then passive and active sm data products are scaled to amsr and ascat observations using the cdf matching method respectively liu et al 2011 dorigo et al 2017 in esa cci v04 5 the passive product combines the individual satellite sm observations from scanning multichannel microwave radiometer ssmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm microwave imager tmi windsat radiometer amsr e amsr 2 and smos while the active data include sm observations from active microwave instrument ami ascat a and ascat b in order to generate the combined v04 5 datasets both of the fusion active and passive data products were rescaled to gldas v2 1 noah sm climatology for 0 10 cm soil layer to avoid the climatological differences between active and passive sm retrievals preimesberger et al 2021 weights for passive and active data were derived from signal to noise estimates on basis of triple collocation dorigo et al 2017 preimesberger et al 2020 specifically individual sm retrievals including ascat a ascat b amsr 2 and smos were remapped to 0 25 spatial resolution and then ingested into the esa cci combined v04 5 over the 1 april 2015 31 december 2018 time period table 1 with quality control using the snow and frozen ground flags 2 3 smops blended soil moisture data product noaa requires high quality satellite sm observations with short latency to improve the accuracy of ncep numeric weather prediction nwp models and national water model nwm at the national water center nwc satellite sm data products from individual satellite sensors not only vary significantly from spatial resolution data quality and archiving file format but also suffer from long latency period and insufficient spatiotemporal coverage to meet the operational users requirements the smops was thus developed at noaa nesdis to produce a blended product of sm retrievals from all available microwave satellite sensors liu et al 2016 yin et al 2014 2015a 2019 2020 after the first version officially released in 2010 the smops data product has been updated twice with considerations to the users feedbacks through improving retrieval algorithms removing old satellite platforms and including new sensors yin et al 2019 2020 specifically smops v3 0 table 1 provides microwave remotely sensed sm data products from ascat a ascat b amsr 2 smos and smap yin et al 2019 2020 the nwp models at noaa ncep need real time satellite sm retrievals arriving within the 6 hour cut off time in order to seamlessly and conveniently provide data to the ncep and nwc smops retrieves sm data from the level 1 brightness temperature observations to make directly available with the shortest possible turn around time zhan et al 2016 the single channel retrieval scr algorithm jackson 1993 is used in smops to produce amsr 2 smos and smap near real time soil moisture retrievals brightness temperature observations from either c or l band of those sensors are converted to emissivity in the scr algorithm and in turn to be corrected by vegetation information and surface roughness jackson 1993 given the dielectric constant determined by the fresnel equation a dielectric mixing model is then used to retrieve the sm liu et al 2016 as ascat a and ascat b data products are produced and distributed in real time by the vienna university of technology via eumetsat european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites operationally wagner et al 2013 the ascat level 2 relative soil moisture data are converted to the volumetric sm using a soil type map liu et al 2016 zhan et al 2016 smops combines all the individual sm retrievals to a blended data layer with better spatial coverage for each 6 hour time period or each day which makes the smops unique yin et al 2019 2020 before the combination all sm observations from individual sensors are remapped to smops 0 25 latitude longitude grids and then scaled to gldas v2 1 noah sm climatology of the 0 10 cm soil layer using the cdf matching method yin et al 2019 2020 the 6 hourly and daily smops blended products are produced by merging all individual sm retrievals acquired within the previous 6 hour and 24 hour windows yin et al 2019 in this paper the daily 0 25 smops v3 0 sm data from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 are quality controlled using the snow and frozen ground flags 2 4 scan soil moisture observations based on the experience of running a national sm and soil temperature pilot project the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the u s department of agriculture usda designed the soil climate analysis network scan to enable in situ observations by overcoming problems including incomplete short term limited areas of coverage and nonstandard sensor arrays schaefer et al 2007 starting in 1999 the standard scan station configuration focuses on the agricultural areas of the u s in support of natural resources assessment it consists of over 200 stations with hourly sm observations automatically recorded by measuring the soil dielectric constant for the sensors hourly scan soil moisture and temperature data are available at national water and climate center home page https www wcc nrcs usda gov scan in this paper scan observations from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 were reprocessed to match the daily time step of noah mp model outputs sm observations either outside of the physically possible range or under frozen conditions on basis of scan soil temperature data were excluded as part of the quality control strategy liu et al 2011 yin et al 2015c after excluding scan sites that provide fewer than 100 day of sm observations there are a total of 155 and 146 sites were chosen in the conus to validate noah mp model 0 10 cm and 40 100 cm sm estimations 3 methods 3 1 noah mp model the noah lsm is an important component of the nwp models for operational weather and climate predations and has been widely used by the noaa ncep chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 however limitations of noah include a combined land surface layer of soil and vegetation a bulk layer of snow and soil using top 5 cm soil texture to represent the entire 200 cm soil column and a weak impeding effect of frozen soil on infiltration and river discharge niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 noah mp was thus developed to address the aforementioned problems through enhancing vegetation phenology frozen soil and infiltration the vegetation canopy energy balance the layered snowpack and sm groundwater interaction and related runoff production niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 compared to noah land surface model the new features in noah mp primarily include modification of two stream radiation transfer scheme to consider the 3 dimension canopy implementation of semi tile vegetation and bare soil and application of interactive energy balance to estimate the canopy skin temperature niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 in this paper the noah mp model v3 6 implemented in the nasa land surface system lis v7 2 kumar et al 2006 2008 peters lidard et al 2011 was employed to intercompare assimilations of gldas 0 10 cm and the blended satellite sm estimations 3 2 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter enkf has been widely used in sequential sm data assimilation evensen 1994 kumar et al 2009 yin et al 2014 2015b in an enkf based da system the ensemble forecast and state variable update steps are alternated by a monte carlo approximation of a sequential bayesian filtering process evensen 1994 the ensemble is typically created by adding gaussian noises to forcing and or state variables with assuming that the ensemble perturbation cannot directly affect the mean model performance ryu et al 2009 the model states y for each ensemble member propagated forward in the forecast step is expressed as 1 y t y t k x t h y t where k h and x vectors are the kalman gain matrix the observation operator and the sm observations respectively the observation operator primarily depends on the observation vectors while the kalman gain matrix is given by 2 k Œ∂ y t h t t h t Œ∂ y t h t t Œ∂ x t where Œ∂ x t indicates error variance for observations while Œ∂ y t is forecast error variance determined by ensemble spread specifically the error variances for gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations as well as smops and esa cci blended sm data products were set as 3 as lis examples kumar et al 2009 the ensemble size was 12 which is the optimal ensemble size in a sequential sm assimilation system yin et al 2015b to update noah mp model states for all da cases and the open loop run perturbation for meteorological forcing parameters and state variables table 2 were applied each individual 1 hr noah mp model time step 3 3 data assimilation strategies the enkf is an optimal da technique if 1 satellite observation errors follow gaussian distribution 2 satellite observations are linearly related to the model simulations and 3 model state errors are also jointly gaussian distributed given almost always biased to model simulations satellite sm observations are generally bias corrected to model simulations in order to satisfy the assumptions kumar et al 2012 nearing et al 2013 yin and zhan 2018 thus the noah mp v3 6 was initially run with the unperturbed meteorological forcing data and model state variables to generate a 0 10 cm sm climatology for the bias correction in this stage the noah mp v3 6 lsm was spun up by cycling 30 times through the period from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 and then the simulations were conducted over the same period with 1 hour time step inputs and daily outputs gldas and the both blended satellite sm estimations were then scaled to the noah mp model 0 10 cm sm climatology using the cdf matching method that has a better spatiotemporal stratification kumar et al 2012 yin and zhan 2018 based on the bias corrected gldas noah v2 1 cci and smops sm datasets the experiment structure was designed to include an open loop run and three da cases specifically 1 the open loop run olp represents the noah mp model runs with the perturbed meteorological forcing data and model state variables table 2 which indicates model simulations under suboptimal forcing conditions the olp run is not benefited by da 2 the da cases were set as assimilation of the bias corrected gldas cci and smops soil moisture estimations into the olp run this means they are forced by the same perturbed meteorological forcing data and model states used in the olp run table 2 and in turn to highlight that the differences between da cases and the olp run are good metrics to evaluate the da impacts in this paper dagld assimilates the gldas sm simulations for 0 10 cm soil layer while dacci and dasmp assimilate the esa cci and smops blended sm data products respectively given the same forcing data model parameters bias correction strategy and perturbation strategies in the same enkf based da system differences among dagld dacci and dasmp are caused only by assimilating the different sm estimations the noah mp lsm with setting ensemble size as 12 was spun up by cycling 20 times through the period from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 the olp run and the three da cases were then conducted at 0 25 spatial resolution on a gridded near global domain from 60 s 180 w to 90 n 180 e over the same period with 1 hour time step inputs and daily outputs the gldas and the both blended satellite sm data were assimilated into the noah mp lsm at each 00 00z through providing the updated 0 10 cm sm condition all noah mp model simulations in this study were forced by precipitation downward longwave and shortwave radiation near surface humidity and wind as well as surface pressure from the global data assimilation system derber et al 1991 3 4 model performance measurements the choice of metrics for measuring model performance mainly depends on the sm nature and characteristics a single metric is sensitive to a specific characteristic and thus not able to well obtain the sm attributes entekhabi et al 2010b in this paper a comprehensive assessment on noah mp model performance was thus conducted using tow widely used metrics including unbiased rmse ubrmse and correlation coefficient r based on the quality controlled scan observations Œ∏ scan the noah mp model sm simulations Œ∏ model for the grid j i are assessed by 3 r j i k 1 n Œ∏ scan k Œ∏ scan Œ∏ model k Œ∏ model k 1 n Œ∏ scan k Œ∏ scan 2 k 1 n Œ∏ model k Œ∏ model 2 4 ubrmse j i i 1 n Œ∏ scan i Œ∏ scan Œ∏ model i Œ∏ model 2 n 1 in this paper the sample size n is 1371 for each grid since there are 1371 days during the period from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 the overbar denotes the averages during the study period similarly the differences between the blended satellite and gldas Œ∏ gldas sm estimations are measured by root mean square error difference rmsd 6 rmsd k 1 n Œ∏ satellite k Œ∏ gldas k 2 n 1 where Œ∏ satellite indicates either smops or esa cci blended sm data products that are available during the study period 4 results 4 1 climatology of gldas and blended satellite soil moisture data products all individual satellite sm observations are scaled to gldas 0 10 cm climatology before they are ingested into smops and cci blended products the smops and cci climatologies are thus first evaluated by comparing with multi year averaged gldas simulations figure 1 shows the temporal averaged cci and smops data products versus the gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations over the global domain from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 the higher sample density area in red color being closer to the black line represents the blended satellite sm observations and gldas simulations match better whereas the lower sample density area shading in the blue color is departure from the ideal regression curve compared to the gldas the multiyear averaged cci shows wetter patterns on the entire global domain figure 1a relatively the smops climatology presents drier patterns in dry areas while exhibiting wetter patterns in the wet areas than the gldas figure 1b with respect to the gldas climatology the correlation coefficients r for cci and smops are 0 871 and 0 921 respectively the good correlations imply that the climatology of both blended satellite sm data products match well with the gldas climatology it also suggests that all individual satellite sm data products ingested into both cci and smops have been successfully scaled to the gldas climatology which allows to reasonably combine them together to produce the blended sm datasets 4 2 differences between gldas and blended satellite soil moisture data products a pair of widely used metrics including correlation coefficient and rmsd are used to evaluate the differences between gldas and the blended satellite sm data products figure 2 shows temporal correlation coefficients between the daily gldas 0 10 sm simulations and the daily cci and smops observations from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 areas shading in red blue color in figures 2a 2b indicates higher lower correlation coefficients the esa cci shows strong consistency with the gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations primarily in the eastern south america india australia sub sahara and the southern africa while low correlations are found in the middle high latitude areas of the north hemisphere figure 2a relatively smops presents weaker agreement with the gldas simulations in not only the high latitude but also middle low latitude areas figure 2b the larger correlation values for smops are mainly found in the sub sahara india and the eastern south america with respect to the gldas the zonal averaged correlation coefficients zacs for cci and smops exhibit lower values less than 0 2 from 40 n to 80 n both cci and smops present greater zacs in the 40 40 n areas where the zacs for cci and smops are spanning 0 4 0 75 and 0 3 0 55 respectively compared to the smops blended sm product the zacs esa cci is higher by about 0 2 in the belt areas located in 40 15 n and 25 35 n relative to the patterns for climatology in figure 1 the gldas based correlation coefficients for multiyear averaged cci and smops are remarkably decreased by their daily dynamics it suggests that the dynamic trends for the both blended satellite sm data products are hardly affected by the scaling procedure before combination besides the correlation coefficient the rmsd is used as another metric to measure the differences between gldas simulations and the blended satellite sm observations figure 3 shows temporal rmsds between the daily gldas simulations and the daily blended satellite sm data products from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 area shading in red color in figures 3a 3b indicates the gldas based rmsd is greater while in blue color means smaller differences with respect to the daily gldas sm simulations for 0 10 cm soil layer the cci primarily exhibits larger rmsd values 0 10 m3 m3 in the high latitude areas figure 3a relatively the smops blended sm data product presents greater gldas based rmsds on the entire global domain figure 3b besides of the high latitude areas the greater rmsd values can also be found in the west conus south america the central africa and the south asia with respect to the gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations the zonal averaged rmsds for cci are spanning from 0 04 to 0 055 m3 m3 in the 50 40 n areas while can reach to 0 09 m3 m3 in the high latitude areas figure 3c the greater differences between the daily smops and gldas can be found in the belt areas located in 45 65 n which can reach to 0 1 m3 m3 the rmsd values for smops basically range from 0 05 m3 m3 to 0 08 m3 m3 in the remaining areas these results suggest that both cci and smops data products can be treated as independent data sources although the individual sm observations ingested into them are scaled to gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology 4 3 validation on da cases with scan observations figures 4 a 4c show the scan observations based ubrmses for noah mp model 0 10 cm sm simulations from the three da cases scan sites in blue color highlight lower ubrmse values whereas in red color mean the da cases perform modest with respect to the quality controlled scan measurements noah mp model with benefits of data assimilation shows a reasonable performance in the west and east conus with the ubrmse values below 0 05 m3 m3 however large errors for the da cases are primarily found in the mississippi river areas and the south conus which can reach to 0 1 m3 m3 based on the same state variables and meteorological forcing data inter comparisons among the three da cases are presented in figures 4d 4f compared to dagld dacci shows better performance in the great plain areas whereas the degradations caused by assimilating cci can be found in the northwestern conus with respect to the scan sm observations noah mp model shows a better behavior with benefits of assimilating the smops sm data product in the central western conus in comparison with the dagld while no significant degradations are found on the entire conus domain both dacci and dasmp perform similar with the dasmp showing lower ubrmse values in the northwest areas figures 4g 4i present the differences in scan measurements based ubrmses for the noah mp model sm simulations in the top soil layer between with and without da benefits sites in blue color indicate improvement whereas those in the warm color indicate degradation benefiting from assimilation of gldas and the blended satellite sm estimations significant improvements on noah mp model performance are found in the western and the central eastern conus yet the degradations for the three da cases can be seen in the great plain areas specifically the conus domain averaged ubrmse for olp is 0 0533 m3 m3 which can be significantly decreased by 0 0011 m3 m3 2 11 reduction 0 0012 m3 m3 2 30 reduction and 0 0018 m3 m3 3 50 reduction by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 compared to the dagld noah mp performance could be further improved by assimilating cci and smops blended sm data products figures 5 a 5c show the scan observations based ubrmses for noah mp model 40 100 cm sm simulations from the three da cases the behavior of noah mp model sm simulations for the topsoil layer are completely mirrored in the deeper soil layer the three da cases present good performance in west and east conus areas with the ubrmse below 0 05 m3 m3 whereas exhibit large uncertainties 0 1 m3 m3 in the mississippi river areas and the south conus it can be found that ubrmses for dagld are tremendously reduced by dacci in the central and west conus areas figure 5d however the dacci show degradations in the south conus in comparison with the dagld which can be significantly improved by the dasmp compared to dagld dasmp presents significant improvement on noah mp model sm simulations for 40 100 cm soil layer in the central western areas while no significant degradations are found on the entire conus domain figure 5e relative to dacci dasmp exhibits lower ubrmses on the conus domain except the upper mississippi river and the south conus areas figure 5f the positive signals from the surface soil layer are reasonably vertically propagated to the deeper soil layer figures 5g 5i with respect to the quality controlled scan measurements ubrmses for olp run are significantly decreased with benefits of assimilating gldas sm estimations in the south and east conus both dacci and dasmp exhibit lower ubrmses on the entire conus domain except few sites scattering in north and south areas in comparison with olp run statistical results show that the conus domain averaged ubrmse for olp run is 0 0588 m3 m3 which can be significantly decreased by 0 0016 m3 m3 2 80 reduction 0 0025 m3 m3 4 44 reduction and 0 0038 m3 m3 6 90 reduction by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 compared to the dagld noah mp model sm simulations for 40 100 cm soil layer are further improved by 1 6 and 4 by assimilating cci and smops sm data products respectively table 3 the second metric is the correlation coefficient r that is commonly used to measure the dynamic trends between model simulations and ground observations figure 6 shows differences in correlation coefficients among dagld dacci and dasmp cases with blue red indicating robust positive negative agreements the dacci is more successful to respect the scan sm observations in the great plain and the east conus areas in comparison with the dagld whereas shows weaker correlations for the scan sites scattering in the northwest and south areas relatively dasmp exhibits less degradations over the dagld while presenting a relative stronger consistent with in situ observations in the central and west conus areas it is very interesting to find that the dasmp presents a more robust agreement in west conus in comparison with the dacci compared to dasmp however dacci has a better behavior in the mississippi river areas the conus domain averaged correlation coefficient for the olp run is 0 549 which is significantly increased by 0 015 2 66 increase 0 017 3 00 increase and 0 026 4 52 increase by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 with respect to the in situ observations noah mp model with benefits of assimilating either cci or smops data product can more reasonably track 0 10 cm sm changes in comparison with assimilation of gldas estimations compared to the top soil layer larger differences in correlation coefficients among dagld dacci and dasmp cases are found for the sm simulations in 40 100 cm soil layer figure 7 statistical results reveal that the dacci is more successfully to track sm dynamic trends over the dagld in the mississippi river and the west conus areas compared to dagld dasmp is more consistent with the quality controlled scan sm measurements on the entire conus domain except few degraded sites over the central and west areas relative to the dacci the dasmp case is more robust agreement with scan observations in the northwest and southeast areas yet shows weaker correlations in the southwest and upper mississippi river areas the conus domain averaged correlation coefficient for the olp run is 0 198 which is significantly increased by 0 039 16 46 increase 0 049 19 84 increase and 0 071 26 39 increase by dagld dacci and dasmp respectively table 3 with respect to the scan observations noah mp model with benefits of assimilating the blended satellite sm data products can more successfully track 40 100 cm sm dynamic trends in comparison with assimilation of gldas estimations 4 4 discussion results in section 4 0 indicate that cci and smops blended satellite data products can well match with gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology but there are significant differences in daily dynamic trends and changes between gldas and satellite observations as a result noah mp model can be further improved by assimilating either cci or smops in comparison with assimilation of gldas sm further considerations relevant to the investigations are discussed here associated with data characteristics advantages of satellite observations and complementary evaluations 4 5 spatial distributions before ingesting into the cci and smops all individual retrievals are scaled to the gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology as a result the multiyear averaged cci and smops sm data products match well with the gldas climatology figure 1 however the large differences between the daily gldas simulations and the daily blended satellite observations can still be found figures 2 3 which allow to treat both of the cci and smops as the independent data sources interannual variations over the 2015 2018 period indicate that gldas 0 10 cm sm simulations are wetter in the u s canada and europe figure 8 in cold season january april than warm season june september which are the opposite to the seasonal variations of precipitation adler et al 2017 compared to gldas cci shows a reasonable spatial distribution with narrowing the differences in season averaged sm values between the cold and warm seasons whereas the opposite interannual variations can still be found in the conus figure 8 relatively interannual variations of smops present a more reasonable spatial distribution in the north hemisphere it exhibits a dryer pattern in cold season while the wetter smops observations can be found in warm season figure 8 these results suggest that the blended satellite observations provide sm information in an independent manner although they even after being re scaled with respect to the gldas climatology as a result the problems of interannual variations in the gldas could be addressed by the cci and smops to better meet the users requirements the developers of soil moisture cci and smops have given a top priority to develop the model free blended soil moisture data products madelon et al 2022 yin et al 2022 given the gldas model errors the individual satellite sm retrievals could be scaled to the l band microwave remote sensing soil moisture observations madelon et al 2022 yin et al 2022 as a result the model free blended satellite sm observations are more successful tracking the surface soil moisture status in comparison with the gldas climatology based data products madelon et al 2022 yin et al 2022 assimilation of the model free blended satellite sm data products is expected to further improve the noah mp performance in the future 4 6 advantages of esa cci and smops synchronous comparisons are generally used to evaluate model and satellite sm estimations with respect to the in situ observations inter comparisons in this way are more direct but subjected to the distinguished differences in sample size determined by data availability yin et al 2019 gldas has a fully spatiotemporal coverage which is much better than cci and smops data product as a result direct comparisons between gldas simulations and satellite observations probably tend to promote smops and cci in an unfair way we thus designed an experiment to comprehensively intercompare noah mp model skills benefiting from assimilation of gldas and the two blended microwave sm data products based on the same meteorological forcing data and model structure noah mp model simulations for the three da cases under the same parameterization and perturbation conditions allow to highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages for those data products assimilated into the olp run noah mp running for dacci and dasmp cases becomes an open loop when the blended satellite sm observations are unavailable given the gldas has a fully spatiotemporal coverage noah mp is supposed to have a better performance with benefits of assimilating the gldas 0 10 cm sm estimations in this paper however statics clearly document that both dacci and dasmp are more successful to respect in situ observations in compassion with dagld this indicates that cci and smops sm data products could provide more accurate information over the gldas even though gldas has a higher data availability in an enkf based da system model simulations are corrected toward the satellite observations and in turn to propagate model states forward in the forecast step yin et al 2014 2015b there are still considerable uncertainties associated seasonal and interannual variations figure 8 in gldas sm simulations although several satellite hydrological observations are used to drive the gldas models rodell et al 2004 this open scientific problem and challenge could be addressed by satellite sm observations benefiting the reasonable spatial patterns noah mp model performance is further improved by dacci and dasmp in this paper compared to the dagld noah mp model sm simulations with benefits of the smops and cci blended sm observations show a better performance with respect to the in situ observations figures 4 9 4 7 inter comparisons of assimilating cci and smops compared to cci smops shows greater differences in gldas based correlation coefficients figure 2 and rmsd values figure 3 over the global domain according to figure 8 however the interannual variations for the smops are more reasonable in comparison with the cci this means satellite observations could provide more reliable sm data in comparison with gldas simulations although the latter one has a great performance with respect to the gldas more significant differences can probably guarantee that much less useful information from satellite observations is lost in the scaling procedure relative to cci smops is more successful to respect the gldas climatology but more independent to track sm changes and dynamic trends as a result the dasmp has a better behavior in comparison with the dacci the spatiotemporal coverage for cci has been significantly improved by the increasing number of available sensors in recent years dorigo et al 2017 and its zonal average can thus reach to 70 90 the esa cci combined v04 5 includes individual sm observations from ascat a ascat b smos and amsr 2 from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2018 table 1 relatively one more individual data product smap was ingested into the smops blended sm over the same period table 1 as a result many gaps remained by the cci can be filled by the smops wang et al 2021 as the latter one has a 90 95 spatiotemporal coverage over the global domain yin et al 2019 with respect to the ground observations the smap presents a good behavior with lower errors in comparison with the current individual sm data products burgin et al 2017 ingesting the smap can thus promote the smops performance and in turn to benefit the dasmp 4 8 conclusions the esa cci and noaa smops are only two blended satellite sm products before the combination all individual satellite observations ingested into cci and smops are scaled to gldas 0 10 cm sm climatology using the cdf matching method this study reveals that there is still a need to develop the blended remotely sensed sm data products although gldas has a reasonable performance with benefits from lsm evolution forcing data improvement and parameterization promotion specifically the noah mp model benefiting from assimilation of gldas simulations for the 0 10 cm soil layer was inter compared with advances of assimilating cci and smops blended sm data products with respect to the quality controlled in situ observations a comprehensive assessment using ubrmse correlation coefficient is conducted to measure the metrics of the three da cases the key results obtained in this paper include both cci and smops can well match gldas climatology as the individual satellite observations are scaled to gldas before the combination with respect to the gldas climatology the correlation coefficients for the cci and smops are 0 871 and 0 921 respectively but both cci and smops can be treated as independent data sources as the low correlation coefficients and large rmsd values between the daily gldas and the daily blended satellite sm estimations noah mp lsm performance can be significantly improved by assimilating gldas cci and smops the improvements can be found for not only the top soil layer but also deep soil layer with reducing unrmse values and increasing the correlations with respect to the quality controlled scan sm measurements relative to assimilation of gldas 0 10 cm estimations noah mp model simulations with benefits of assimilating cci and smops are more successful to track sm changes and dynamic trends with respect to in situ

current understandings around the nexus through text analysis we compared the abstracts of undercited works to the most highly cited wef nexus articles and found that these articles shared similar language and themes we also found several differences in how some of the most common words were used our results also show a higher geographic diversity of authors within the undercited works compared to highly cited this methodological approach and our research findings have important implications for default search engine structure and scholarly visibility both of which are important to carefully contemplate as we work to both promote a more inclusive academic enterprise and strive to make advances toward sustainable management of food water and energy systems keywords review wef water food energy nexus citation bias few underrepresented methods systematic review nexus keywords data availability i have shared all associated data and code as supplemental attachments 1 background and purpose within the hydrology community there has been an increasing recognition that connection across food energy and water wef systems should play an important role in study and management of our natural resources endo et al 2020 2017 grady et al 2019 jalilov et al 2016 smajgl et al 2016 several previous reviews have highlighted strengths and weaknesses of integrating these very different systems within the nexus albrecht et al 2018 d odorico et al 2018 endo et al 2017 leck et al 2015 these reviews have highlighted the over representation of quantitative modeling approaches albrecht et al 2018 endo et al 2017 they have also called for increased use of participatory approaches that work with stakeholders policy makers or decision makers across the nexus albrecht et al 2018 to date however wef nexus communities have encountered significant barriers to progress endo et al 2020 leck et al 2015 thus there is a continual need to derive new perspectives on wef research to create meaningful momentum and responses to global environmental challenges marginalized academic researchers many wef nexus scholars included also face systemic barriers to progress due to all types of biases and obstacles ghiasi et al 2015 griffin 2020 kelly et al 2017 lisnic et al 2019 these biases and inequalities permeate scholarly discourse as evident through several studies that have used citation analyses to understand scientific progress and research performance for example one study of over 670 000 engineering articles published between 2008 and 2013 found that while women engineers tend to publish their work in journals with higher impact factors than their male counterparts they still receive wefer citations and thus less recognition from the broader community ghiasi et al 2015 likewise across multiple disciplines a study of over 5 million research papers found that all articles with women in preeminent author positions have wefer citations than those of men in the same author order larivi√®re et al 2013 even after accounting for the impact factor of the journal and career stage of the author numerous other articles have also found gender discrepancies between citation metrics across disciplines caplar et al 2017 dion et al 2018 ferber and br√ºn 2011 fulvio et al 2021 maliniak et al 2013 beyond gender non white scholars are also widely underrepresented across editorial positions citation rates and publication rates in multiple disciplines chakravartty et al 2018 ginther et al 2018 while multiple systematic changes are necessary to remove these obstacles and inequalities one step towards broadening discourse is to first recognize learn from and cite underrepresented scholarship there are two underlying assertions driving our review first we assert that we can learn something from undercited studies on the wef nexus second our systematic reverse citation analysis contributes meaningful insights into citation biases across the scientific enterprise this method also provides a way to elevate undercited scholarship without assuming the gender or racial identity of scholars together this work offers a glimpse at methodological approaches for systematic reviews seeking to capture work less often represented in academic discourse this research systematically studies undercited work in the wef nexus to recognize less represented scholars and broaden knowledge in the nexus research community 2 methods 2 1 database generation and categorical analysis our goal of this study was to focus on developing understandings around the wef nexus from marginalized scholarship however because we did not want to assume the gender or racial identity of any scholars with whom we did not know personally we chose to develop a reverse citation analysis approach to systematic reviews of underrepresented works in the wef nexus this work builds off prior scholarship by describing systematic citation biases for marginalized scholars although all authors in our sample may not come from marginalized communities we created our database by including all publications that were returned from a keyword search across the web of science and scopus databases fig 1 keyword search terms were chosen if they returned a reasonable number of search results supplemental table s1 and publications that appeared primarily relevant to wef nexus frameworks upon inspection we downloaded database outputs from the selected search terms for all articles that had under 5 citations according to the citation count in the search databases web of science and scopus at the time of download after identification duplicates were removed by matching titles and dois of the two database outputs all team members participated in screening the initial article set n 880 manually through reading abstracts during screening we removed articles published after 2020 n 453 because they did not have adequate time to become cited we also removed articles that were not from peer reviewed journals i e book sections conference papers editorials and opinions n 189 in addition we screened out articles that were not in english or did not actually relate to wef nexus scholarship after screening we proceeded to code the remaining articles n 202 through a qualtrics response form supplemental section 1 1 during the coding process another 92 articles were removed for not meeting the inclusion criteria after the completion of the coding process the author team recognized that some of the works which were coded did not meet a minimum publishable standard thus we decided to remove 32 additional articles from our final set for analysis to determine the minimum publishable standard each team member evaluated the article on two questions does the article have a clearly articulated research question s does the article articulate clear methods to answer that research question if the team could not identify a formal research question of any type or could not identify clear methods to answer that question the article was excluded from further analysis in the event there was uncertainty about a particular article we circulated the article among multiple team members to make a collective decision about inclusion or exclusion 2 2 data analysis we used three techniques to conduct our review fig 2 the first two techniques involved automated comparison between our set of undercited works and a set of the most highly cited scholarship derived from the web of science and scopus databases with the same keywords and the same number of articles n 78 the set of most cited articles also went through the same identification screening and eligibility steps to create the final list of articles we removed all duplicates and ensured that the years of search aligned with the undercited works of the most cited dataset we did not remove any due to being non peer reviewed since all of the articles we collected from this search were peer reviewed additionally once identification screening and eligibility steps generated a most cited dataset of roughly 300 articles we sorted them by highest citation and retained only the 78 most highly cited so that the two datasets were equal size to analyze the content of both highly cited and undercited works we leveraged the natural language processing toolkit nltk in python bird et al 2009 dennis and grady 2022 to compare word frequencies and examine similarities and differences between highly cited and least cited articles supplemental information section 1 2 for our second set of analyses and hypotheses we compared author location between highly cited and least cited articles supplemental information section 1 2 lastly we manually coded the final set of undercited wef nexus scholarship using a qualtrics form supplemental section 1 1 to descriptively analyze the details of these works both datasets for the most cited and undercited articles are attached as supplemental excel files 3 results our results indicate several main findings fig 3 3 1 content analysis we found word frequencies between the least cited and most cited articles to be highly similar of the top 50 most frequently used words between both groups 30 words were the same fig 4 within the top 15 words 11 words were identical in an effort to further understand these words we broadly categorized the words based on assumed use in the article across the themes of framework justification policy research scale and general words across these themes both the highly cited and the least cited articles leveraged the same words to justify much of their work describe their research and identify components of their wef framework across the theme scale the most cited articles frequently used country and global words within their abstracts while the most frequent least cited words related to scale included local community population and area the only scale word that was common across both the most and least cited abstracts was the word region beyond word frequencies we investigated both the similarity and concordance commands in nltk to better understand the ways in which these words are used either similarly or differently in each body of abstracts for several key words the word system revealed similar use by both sets of articles across several aspects of wefs including water food and nexus separately however within the least cited articles the word system was also used in similar contexts to words including sustainable user and clewf climate land energy water food across the most cited article abstracts integrated and resource were also used in a similar context for the word system when investigating the words that share the same context as the word resource across both sets the words energy and nexus were both shared the least cited articles also used the words policy scarcity consumption and market in a similar context to resource perhaps implying a focus on managed energy resources the most cited abstracts also leveraged resource in a similar context to one managed resource word institution and the words availability worsens and quality possibly inferring an interest in both quantity and quality of resources one word that was used in different contexts across both sets was the word development here we found the words including food agriculture commercial and international to be leveraged in a similar way within the least cited abstracts in the most cited abstracts the word development was used in a similar context as management and resilient we interpret this to mean that the least cited articles are concerned with agricultural system advancement when regarding development whereas the most cited articles may be leveraging the word development in the context of development planning and resilient built environments overall we can infer several context based findings from our natural language processing analysis first we interpret that the frequency analysis implies that abstract word choices are highly similar across both sets of articles second the word similarity analysis did showcase that several of these words were used in both similar and distinct ways using the same language in different contexts has the potential to challenge a more fluid link between scholarship areas 3 2 authorship location and collaboration to investigate the difference between the most cited and undercited articles in space we plot the number of authors per country in both datasets fig 5 we use author affiliation address provided by scopus to get the country of each author s institution our results show that undercited authors represented a more diverse geographical distribution than the most cited articles in the wef nexus literature fig 5 this aligns with previous research that has found geographic and nationalistic biases impact citation patterns gomez et al 2022 pasterkamp et al 2007 as expected united states of america china australia and countries in western europe have the largest share of authors in both data sets however authors from countries in africa south america and south asia are more represented in the undercited work we also found that the most cited articles had a larger range and higher average number of authors per article than the least cited articles supplemental fig s1 which suggests a lower level of collaboration in undercited articles to understand the nature of international collaborations we further investigated whether these collaborations were occurring between countries with high research productivity between countries with low research productivity or between countries with high and low research productivity we use the springer nature index database which ranks countries and territories by research output springer 2022 to assess the level of research productivity by country we deemed the top 10 countries in terms of research productivity according to the nature index as high research productivity countries for this study we found the most highly cited authors had more international collaborations on average supplemental fig s2 and those collaborations consisted of collaboration between high to high research productivity countries about 30 of the time compared to about 10 of the time in the undercited works supplemental fig s2 3 3 categorical analysis reflections on the undercited our undercited articles spanned multiple types of study and approach fig 6 we found that the diversity of timescales of analysis is increasing over time fig 6a as is engagement with non academics fig 6c case study articles were quite prevalent within our article set 62 or 49 articles contained at least 1 case study confirming our initial hypothesis that case based work would be less likely to be cited by confirming this hypothesis our results seem to affirm that scholars across multiple fields unnecessarily devalue case study approaches when compared to studies that leverage generalizable methods such as randomized controlled trials hyett et al 2014 tight 2010 most of the articles included empirical data collection of some type fig 6b and many engaged with stakeholders outside of academia and provided policy recommendations within their work fig 6c 6d the geographic extent and spatial scale at which a wef system was investigated was diverse across these works fig 6e while the united states and china still dominated the countries studied within the undercited works there were 50 different countries represented across the 78 articles supplemental fig s4 beyond descriptive summaries we found several noteworthy articles which captured our curiosity or taught us something new about the wef nexus hanna 2020 presented a detailed analysis and review of how political economic drivers in the middle east and north africa relate to challenges studied in the wef nexus such as virtual water trade hanna 2020 in doing so the author highlights gaps between scientific understanding around virtual water trade and wef nexus research with realities driving development behavior of both state and non state actors in the region hanna 2020 kshetry and varshney 2017 presented a network science definition of a foodshed and showcased differences across comparisons between the united states and india kshetry and varshney 2017 another interesting work integrated qualitative and quantitative research by conducting interviews workshops seminars and other avenues of communication to inform a systems dynamic model gonz√°lez rosell et al 2020 in uzbekistan one study showed how both policy and technical improvements could be made to garner water and energy savings without compromising agricultural yields djumaboev et al 2019 within the agricultural tools another work from our undercited studies conducted a comprehensive economic and environmental wef analysis of an agricultural tool for wheat production the case study provides valuable information for agricultural management and promotes the need for policy initiatives for such technologies fabiani et al 2020 across the american west one study in colorado used rich ethnographic qualitative data to show the ways in which wealthy non local often new energy producers distort and control water markets impacting stakeholders water access and restricting actors abilities to generate solutions to issues through water transfer markets malin and macilroy 2019 finally hibbett et al 2020 highlighted a broader array of stakeholders that are often missed from discussions around wef nexus community participation and interactions hibbett et al 2020 while not exhaustive these examples highlight the depth and breadth of the work throughout our undercited studies showcasing many topics and areas of interest to wef nexus scholars 4 discussion and limitation 4 1 discussion and implications in comparing our results to existing comprehensive wefs reviews we can articulate several similarities one review of 245 journal articles found that three quarters of their reviewed works included quantitative modeling approaches while one quarter leveraged some social science methods and one fifth used a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches albrecht et al 2018 our undercited works followed a similar breakdown though had slightly more qualitative and conceptual papers 30 as opposed to quantitative 50 supplemental fig s3 we also found that 20 of our studies included both qualitative and quantitative methods this further implies similarity across commonly cited and undercited works supplemental fig s3 another important outcome relating to scale of study that has been highlighted by previous reviews is the uncertainty associated with large system scales zhang et al 2018 when studying global scale wef nexus challenges data resolution uncertainty and assumptions have the potential to create results that may not adequately represent reality zhang et al 2018 the implications of our research show that undercited works could be valuable sources of local and regional information from real world smaller case studies case study research has long been undervalued due to the lack of generalizability based on research design yet there are still many important outcomes that can be gleaned from these works another interesting trend we observed with the undercited works was that most of these works were not available in an open access format in the majority of cases we could access the articles via our intuitional libraries access licenses however we had to request interlibrary loans for 9 of our 78 article set although this cannot be proven based on this study we hypothesize that one reason some of these works are undercited is because they are held behind a paywall and in the case of those in which we had to request loans to access them published in journals that do not have broad subscriptions from our specific research 1 designated university the cost of publishing open access costs and the ethics of publishing behind paywalls continues to highlight biases and limitations in the scientific enterprise racimo et al 2022 van noorden 2013 scholars from multiple disciplines have proposed potential steps to redress citation bias in scientific literature by requiring authors to include a citation diversity statement in a manuscript submitted for publication dworkin et al 2020 ray et al 2022 rowson et al 2021 zurn et al 2020 such statements depending on depth and form could certainly position authors to reflect on how their choice of citations relates to challenges of citation and other related biases ray et al 2022 they do however present several practical and ethical issues that ought to be considered before requiring adoption ray et al 2022 beyond such statements we argue within this paper that starting with the process of reviewing and learning from undercited works can move academic research in the direction of confronting these biases that perpetuate structural barriers to women and people of color in research 4 2 limitation as with all research scholarship there are limitations to our approach first we chose an arbitrary cutoff of 5 citations to group our undercited dataset this citation count took place when the articles were downloaded in may 2022 and several of these articles have since received more than five citations second we chose not to double code each article which is considered a stronger practice in systematic reviews for two reasons first we believed the effort and time tradeoff it would take to double code each article was not justified with the pace at which we hoped to complete this project additionally as a lab that is focused on wef nexus scholarship we felt that our existing expertise allowed us to individually code each article without necessary secondary coding and reconciling processes we also limited our review to include only printed in english which is a limitation in the broader scientific knowledge community since a substantial portion of scholarship is written in other languages another avenue for future work to further unlock learning from this approach could be to follow the citation trees of both the undercited and highly cited works in doing so we could understand more details about whether multiple studies are citing the same wef articles because they are all leveraging each other s citation lists further entrenching the highly cited papers likewise we might have more insight on if the undercited works would have been considered out of scope for more highly cited articles 4 3 personal reflections stepping into our own agency we as authors found several significant outcomes related to personal reflections about this review process first we found that there were about 30 n 32 of our initial set of undercited works that were not up to what our team considered minimum publishable standard and that could be a clear reason why these articles were not cited this leads us to conclude that while our approach on reverse citation analysis is meant to unlock new insights from marginalized works quality control measures are important to ensure that the work considered meets minimum standards for reproducible research and peer review in order to add to the discourse this process also allowed us to reflect on technological forcing that unless an individual is attuned to pay attention to may continue to perpetuate under representation in citations and scholarly recognition specifically the way that search engine results are sorted by default in a variety of academic search engines continues to prioritize citations alongside relevance to keywords through this process we have derived the assertion that in order to broaden reading scholarship and citations real consideration and effort must be made to find and cite works that do not often come across our commonly returned search results 5 conclusion it has long been recognized that biases are present in higher education and academic research ghiasi et al 2015 griffin 2020 kelly et al 2017 studies have shown unequal distribution of research funding hiring decisions search committee challenges and citation biases among others women and people of color often bear the brunt of these inequities one way to bridge these inequities is to cite and recognize the work of marginalized scholars despite these understandings we do not often take time to reflect on what we can learn from missing works in the academic discourse in this review we set out to undertake a review of water energy food nexus research in a way that centralized how undercited works differ from highly cited articles we collected analyzed and learned from underrepresented works in the food water energy nexus by doing a reverse citation systematic review our work found that although these works have lower citations they use similar words to describe the work and they use similar methods to deploy their work differences include geographical distribution of authors number of coauthors and type of author to author collaboration credit authorship contribution statement caitlin grady

s4 beyond descriptive summaries we found several noteworthy articles which captured our curiosity or taught us something new about the wef nexus hanna 2020 presented a detailed analysis and review of how political economic drivers in the middle east and north africa relate to challenges studied in the wef nexus such as virtual water trade hanna 2020 in doing so the author highlights gaps between scientific understanding around virtual water trade and wef nexus research with realities driving development behavior of both state and non state actors in the region hanna 2020 kshetry and varshney 2017 presented a network science definition of a foodshed and showcased differences across comparisons between the united states and india kshetry and varshney 2017 another interesting work integrated qualitative and quantitative research by conducting interviews workshops seminars and other avenues of communication to inform a systems dynamic model gonz√°lez rosell et al 2020 in uzbekistan one study showed how both policy and technical improvements could be made to garner water and energy savings without compromising agricultural yields djumaboev et al 2019 within the agricultural tools another work from our undercited studies conducted a comprehensive economic and environmental wef analysis of an agricultural tool for wheat production the case study provides valuable information for agricultural management and promotes the need for policy initiatives for such technologies fabiani et al 2020 across the american west one study in colorado used rich ethnographic qualitative data to show the ways in which wealthy non local often new energy producers distort and control water markets impacting stakeholders water access and restricting actors abilities to generate solutions to issues through water transfer markets malin and macilroy 2019 finally hibbett et al 2020 highlighted a broader array of stakeholders that are often missed from discussions around wef nexus community participation and interactions hibbett et al 2020 while not exhaustive these examples highlight the depth and breadth of the work throughout our undercited studies showcasing many topics and areas of interest to wef nexus scholars 4 discussion and limitation 4 1 discussion and implications in comparing our results to existing comprehensive wefs reviews we can articulate several similarities one review of 245 journal articles found that three quarters of their reviewed works included quantitative modeling approaches while one quarter leveraged some social science methods and one fifth used a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches albrecht et al 2018 our undercited works followed a similar breakdown though had slightly more qualitative and conceptual papers 30 as opposed to quantitative 50 supplemental fig s3 we also found that 20 of our studies included both qualitative and quantitative methods this further implies similarity across commonly cited and undercited works supplemental fig s3 another important outcome relating to scale of study that has been highlighted by previous reviews is the uncertainty associated with large system scales zhang et al 2018 when studying global scale wef nexus challenges data resolution uncertainty and assumptions have the potential to create results that may not adequately represent reality zhang et al 2018 the implications of our research show that undercited works could be valuable sources of local and regional information from real world smaller case studies case study research has long been undervalued due to the lack of generalizability based on research design yet there are still many important outcomes that can be gleaned from these works another interesting trend we observed with the undercited works was that most of these works were not available in an open access format in the majority of cases we could access the articles via our intuitional libraries access licenses however we had to request interlibrary loans for 9 of our 78 article set although this cannot be proven based on this study we hypothesize that one reason some of these works are undercited is because they are held behind a paywall and in the case of those in which we had to request loans to access them published in journals that do not have broad subscriptions from our specific research 1 designated university the cost of publishing open access costs and the ethics of publishing behind paywalls continues to highlight biases and limitations in the scientific enterprise racimo et al 2022 van noorden 2013 scholars from multiple disciplines have proposed potential steps to redress citation bias in scientific literature by requiring authors to include a citation diversity statement in a manuscript submitted for publication dworkin et al 2020 ray et al 2022 rowson et al 2021 zurn et al 2020 such statements depending on depth and form could certainly position authors to reflect on how their choice of citations relates to challenges of citation and other related biases ray et al 2022 they do however present several practical and ethical issues that ought to be considered before requiring adoption ray et al 2022 beyond such statements we argue within this paper that starting with the process of reviewing and learning from undercited works can move academic research in the direction of confronting these biases that perpetuate structural barriers to women and people of color in research 4 2 limitation as with all research scholarship there are limitations to our approach first we chose an arbitrary cutoff of 5 citations to group our undercited dataset this citation count took place when the articles were downloaded in may 2022 and several of these articles have since received more than five citations second we chose not to double code each article which is considered a stronger practice in systematic reviews for two reasons first we believed the effort and time tradeoff it would take to double code each article was not justified with the pace at which we hoped to complete this project additionally as a lab that is focused on wef nexus scholarship we felt that our existing expertise allowed us to individually code each article without necessary secondary coding and reconciling processes we also limited our review to include only printed in english which is a limitation in the broader scientific knowledge community since a substantial portion of scholarship is written in other languages another avenue for future work to further unlock learning from this approach could be to follow the citation trees of both the undercited and highly cited works in doing so we could understand more details about whether multiple studies are citing the same wef articles because they are all leveraging each other s citation lists further entrenching the highly cited papers likewise we might have more insight on if the undercited works would have been considered out of scope for more highly cited articles 4 3 personal reflections stepping into our own agency we as authors found several significant outcomes related to personal reflections about this review process first we found that there were about 30 n 32 of our initial set of undercited works that were not up to what our team considered minimum publishable standard and that could be a clear reason why these articles were not cited this leads us to conclude that while our approach on reverse citation analysis is meant to unlock new insights from marginalized works quality control measures are important to ensure that the work considered meets minimum standards for reproducible research and peer review in order to add to the discourse this process also allowed us to reflect on technological forcing that unless an individual is attuned to pay attention to may continue to perpetuate under representation in citations and scholarly recognition specifically the way that search engine results are sorted by default in a variety of academic search engines continues to prioritize citations alongside relevance to keywords through this process we have derived the assertion that in order to broaden reading scholarship and citations real consideration and effort must be made to find and cite works that do not often come across our commonly returned search results 5 conclusion it has long been recognized that biases are present in higher education and academic research ghiasi et al 2015 griffin 2020 kelly et al 2017 studies have shown unequal distribution of research funding hiring decisions search committee challenges and citation biases among others women and people of color often bear the brunt of these inequities one way to bridge these inequities is to cite and recognize the work of marginalized scholars despite these understandings we do not often take time to reflect on what we can learn from missing works in the academic discourse in this review we set out to undertake a review of water energy food nexus research in a way that centralized how undercited works differ from highly cited articles we collected analyzed and learned from underrepresented works in the food water energy nexus by doing a reverse citation systematic review our work found that although these works have lower citations they use similar words to describe the work and they use similar methods to deploy their work differences include geographical distribution of authors number of coauthors and type of author to author collaboration credit authorship contribution statement caitlin grady
