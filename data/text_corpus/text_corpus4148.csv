20740,extreme wave forces have damaged massive coastal bridges in the past decades to the best knowledge of the authors a direct comparison of dynamic wave deck interactions between t type and box girder decks under the same wave conditions has not been studied this paper establishes a numerical model solving the navier stokes equations for viscous and incompressible free surface flows which is verified by existing experimental data a total of 54 numerical experiments based on this model are then carried out to investigate the dynamic responses of two bridge decks under various wave conditions and the influences of hydrodynamic parameters on the wave deck interaction are studied two peak values are found in the curve of lateral displacement versus dimensionless submersion depth for the t type girder deck while one peak value is found in the curve for the box girder deck the relations between lateral displacement and period for two decks are both uncertain which highly depends on the submersion depth and girder type the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave height for two bridge decks which is only valid when the horizontal wave force in the specified wave height is large enough to overcome the frictional force this study provides researchers an insight into the difference of instantaneous lateral displacement between two most commonly used cross section shapes of bridge deck and helps to further understand the fragility of t type and box girder decks under extreme waves author keywords t type girder deck box girder deck wave deck interaction wave forces 1 introduction coastal bridges are vulnerable to damage by extreme ocean surface waves and massive coastal highway bridges have been damaged in the past decades in hurricane ivan 2004 84 t type girder bridge spans from the eastbound and the westbound fell into the water from the support structure and 19 bridge spans were displaced at varying distance from their initial positions over escambia bay in hurricane katrina 2005 a total of 58 t type girder bridge spans were completely removed from their support structures and more than 379 spans were laterally displaced varying distances sheppard and marin 2009 field observations showed the bridge decks were in three states after the disaster i e fixed state partially displaced state and falling down state in the fixed state the bridge deck remains stationary and no displacement happens when the wave force surpasses the structure capacities and the connection between the bridge deck and substructure failures the bridge deck moves on the pile cap and it is called the partially displaced state if the final position of the bridge deck is on the support structure if the lateral deck displacement is large the deck fell into the water from the support structure and it is called the falling down state the repair cost changes with the lateral deck displacement especially within different states padgett et al 2008 besides it takes much more time for the relocation of bridges in the falling down state compared with the partially displaced state which significantly affects the recovery speed thus the investigations of wave forces on the bridge decks and the lateral deck displacement help to further understand the fragility of t type and box girder decks under extreme waves so far numerous experiments have been carried out to investigate the wave forces acting on coastal bridge decks e g douglass et al 2006 sugimoto and unjoh 2007 bradner 2008 mcpherson 2008 cuomo et al 2009 sheppard and marin 2009 bradner et al 2011 lau et al 2011 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 seiffert et al 2015a guo et al 2015 chen et al 2016 xiao and guo 2019 huang et al 2018 huang et al 2019 fang et al 2019 zhu and dong 2020 bradner 2008 conducted a large scale laboratory observation of wave forces on a typical section of the i 10 bridge over escambia bay that failed during hurricane ivan in 2004 and the experimental data were analyzed to study the relation among impulse load horizontal forces and vertical forces fang et al 2019 investigated the wave forces on coastal t type girder bridge decks subjected to oblique wave attack and found the vertical wave force reached the peak at a wave angle of 30 under a clearance of 4 0 cm showing the wave overtopping had a significant effect on the vertical force in the semi submerged and submerged cases based on the experimental data numerous empirical equations were proposed for engineering applications to get a quick estimation of the wave forces e g mcconnell et al 2004 douglass et al 2006 cuomo et al 2007 aashto 2008 chen et al 2009 liu et al 2019 as empirical equations are only applicable to specified structures and wave conditions the machine learning technique has been regarded as an efficient way to predict the wave forces after lots of experimental and simulated data are gained e g xu et al 2018a b xu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 proposed an approach for sequentially updating surrogate models with augmented data in civil engineering and the message gained through the limited computational experimental effort is maximized with the rapid development of computer technology numerical simulation of the wave deck interaction by computational fluid dynamics cfd has gained popularity for it provides the researchers an approach to studying the instantaneous interaction e g huang and xiao 2009 bozorgnia and lee 2012 azadbakht and yim 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 xu and cai 2014 seiffert et al 2015a chen et al 2016a xu et al 2018a b qu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 zhu and dong 2020 chen et al 2020 huang and xiao 2009 utilized a numerical model based on the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations to investigate dynamic wave forces exerted on the t type girder bridge deck located in escambia bay damaged in hurricane ivan and got the time histories of wave profiles turbulent velocity fields dynamic uplift and horizontal forces xu and cai 2014 used the cfd method to study the wave forces acting on the curved bridge with inclination angles from 10 to 10 in biloxi bay indicating the bridge deck inclination affected time histories of wave forces significantly through the time histories of forces gained by the cfd method one can judge whether the bridge deck is going to be damaged in extreme waves most of the researchers mentioned above focused on the typical t type girder deck which is widely used in regions of the eastern pacific especially in the coastal zones of north america nevertheless the t type girder deck has the shortcomings of low load bearing capability and large workload of installation engineers in modern days tend to use the box girder deck in long span coastal bridges especially in the coastal areas of china where massive new coastal bridges are under construction as shown in fig 1 the wave deck interaction between t type and box girder deck may be quite different as the geometric shape is totally different which suffers from the water pressure acted by incident wave besides the entrapped air in the cavities formed by t type girders has a significant role in enhancing the vertical wave load on bridge deck bricker and nakayama 2014 seiffert et al 2015b qu et al 2017 while no cavity exists in the box type girder deck hayashi 2013 conducted waterway experiments to study the wave force acting on a fixed box girder bridge deck and some parameters were investigated including wave height flow velocity and inclination the experimental results showed the wave forces varied with these three parameters except that the moment remained almost the same with inclinations from 0 to 2 86 huang et al 2018 used experimental and numerical methods to study the wave forces on box girder bridge decks with various wave heights and submergence coefficients it is found the impulse force should not be neglected in the design of the box girder deck as the maximum impulse force could reach two times that of quasi steady force under elevated conditions horizontal and vertical forces increased with the wave height except when the submergence coefficient is equal to zero there is a lack of dynamic studies on the wave deck interaction as it is more complicated and challenging when the deck is movable compared with the fixed deck xu and cai 2015 took bridge vibration under solitary wave forces into consideration and built a single degree of freedom sdof system to study the influence of lateral restraining stiffness effect on bridge deck wave interaction and the motion characteristics of bridge decks with spring restraint driven by stokes waves were studier later in xu and cai 2017 however the model is not applicable to simulating the free motion of bridge decks when the connection structure between the superstructure and substructure fails to simplify the model the frictional force in the sdof caused by the deck and pile cap is neglected avallone et al 2006 indicated the friction coefficient between the bridge deck and the pile caps is usually less than 0 7 and a value of 0 55 was adopted in the study of wave deck interaction by chen et al 2016b bradner et al 2011 conducted a large scale experiment on wave deck interaction and found the peak value of vertical force was approximately three to five times as large as that of horizontal forces as the frictional force equals the product of friction coefficient and deck weight and the peak value of vertical wave force is slighter larger or smaller than deck weight it is found that the frictional force and the horizontal wave force are of the same order of magnitude thus it is highly suggested to take frictional force into consideration when studying the lateral displacement of the bridge deck in the study of fixed bridge deck the structure is judged safe if the uplift force was smaller than the weight however the authors previous research on movable t type girder bridge decks found the bridge was able to move even when the uplift wave force was smaller than the weight as long as the horizontal wave force was larger than the constraint force chen et al 2016b the failure mechanisms of coastal bridges under different extreme wave conditions still require further studies xu and cai 2014 huang et al 2018 2019 to the best knowledge of the authors there are few studies focusing on the freely movable bridge deck to fill the knowledge gap the objective of this paper is to conduct a comparative study on the wave deck interactions for movable t type and box girder decks under stokes waves with the consideration of frictional force and investigate the influences of essential hydrodynamic parameters submersion depth wave period and wave height on lateral displacements of the two bridge decks this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a description of the numerical model built in this paper in section 3 the dynamic model is verified by the experimental data of a freely floating type body driven by stokes waves subsequently the influences of submersion depth wave period and wave height on the sway lateral motions of bridge deck with two shapes are studied and the failure mechanisms for two decks are discussed finally section 4 summarizes the findings with several conclusions 2 model development and experimental verification a two dimensional 2 d numerical model for simulating wave deck interaction in the numerical wave tank nwt is established in the paper the computational fluid dynamics cfd package fluent is chosen as the basic solver in the numerical model the user defined functions udf written in c programming language have been added into the solver to enhance the capability of the package in simulating the movable bridge deck under the wave action in the numerical wave tank wave absorption zones are distributed on both sides of the tank to efficiently absorb the reflected and transmitted waves ensuring the core zone of wave deck interaction is not affected by the reflected wave the relaxation method is utilized in the wave absorption zones and further information about the relaxation method is illustrated in afshar 2010 and chen et al 2017 the volume of fluid vof method has been successfully adopted in capturing the fluctuating water surface e g chen et al 2016b xu et al 2018a b zhao et al 2020 and it is also used in the current model 2 1 governing equations the rng k ϵ is derived using a statistical technique called renormalization group theory compared with the standard k ϵ model the rng k ϵ model is more accurate and reliable for a broader class of flows than the standard k ϵ model orszag et al 1993 thus the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and rng k ϵ turbulence model is used in the paper to simulate the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 i 1 2 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i compared with instantaneous navier stokes equations the additional term ρ u i u j is called as the reynolds stress which represents the effects of turbulence s i is the momentum source in different directions to appropriately model the reynolds stress the k ϵ models are employed for the rng k ϵ model the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ϵ are obtained from the following transport equations 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j α k μ e f f k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k 4 t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j α ε μ e f f ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 3 ε g b c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k r ε s ε where g k represents the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients g b is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to buoyancy y m represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate the quantities α k and α ε are the inverse effective prandtl numbers for k and ϵ respectively s k and s ε are user defined source terms 2 2 numerical wave tank details of some experiments are listed in table 1 which is sorted by the publication date it is seen the experiments are mainly focused on the t type girder deck damaged in the storms of hurricanes ivan 2004 and katrina 2005 in recent years box girder bridge decks have been widely used in the coastal areas of china with the rapid development of highway construction as it has obvious advantages over the t type girder decks and corresponding experiments are being carried out to study the wave forces on box girder bridge decks e g huang et al 2018 huang et al 2019 the scale of bridge models adopted by different researchers ranges from 1 100 to 1 5 which covers a wide range in laboratory experiments it faces numerous challenges to model the complex process of waves acting on highway bridge superstructures the foremost is the recreation of a kinematically similar wave structure interaction in the laboratory bradner et al 2011 if the scale is too small some monitored results e g the effect of trapped air may not be well in accordance with froude criteria cuomo et al 2009 the scale effects of elastic forces due to trapped and or entrained air can be minimized by testing at a large scale model bradner et al 2011 therefore it is a good choice to choose a large scale experiment for the verification of the current numerical model additionally it is seen in table 1 that the dynamic motions of the bridge decks are only considered in the experiments carried out at oregon state university osu thus the experiment with a large scale 1 5 t type girder bridge deck carried out in the laboratory of osu is utilized for the verification where the bridge deck is allowed to move freely in the horizontal lateral direction to study the dynamic properties fig 2 shows the test setups installed in osu s large wave flume and the numerical wave tank built in the paper based on the large scale experiment is shown in fig 3 2 3 mesh update method the overset mesh is utilized to deal with the motions of the bridge deck due to the incident wave in this paper the overset mesh is an effective method of preserving high mesh quality in the duration of fierce wave deck interaction with large motion displacements background and component meshes are established in the methodology different from the traditional mesh update method the two sets of meshes are independent of each other by marking all points inside the boundary and outside the computational domain as the hole points or dead cells the process of hole cutting is done by cutting surfaces to identify the approximation of the overset wall boundary to provide continuous solutions different cell zones are coupled by an interface in the process of hole cutting flow information is transferred from the donor cells to the associated overlapping cell zones the receptors then gain messages from the corresponding overlap cell zone and vice versa fig 4 a gives a schematic drawing of the background mesh zone and the overlapping component after the process of hole cutting in the overset area the extracted flow domain is shown in fig 4 b as the overset meshes move together with the movable structure no mesh deformation occurs in the long period of wave structure interaction regardless of any motion response type when the structure moves the background component keeps stationary in space the coupling between two components is implicit and flow information in the cells of the overlapping region are solved simultaneously by utilizing the discretized governing equations on the overset mesh boundaries in the interpolation method receptor cells within the overset interface receive messages from adjacent donors which can be interpolated by the following equation 5 h i 0 n d w i i where is the solution variable n d is the number of donors and w is the interpolation weights 2 4 numerical implementation the governing equations in fluent are discretized based on the finite volume method fvm pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is used for the pressure velocity coupling with pressure staggering option presto discretization scheme the quadratic upwind interpolation of convective kinematics quick algorithm is used to discretize the momentum convection the procedure for solving the wave structure interaction is described as follows the structure is taken as a rigid body and its motion are solved by the following equations 6 m x f t o t a l 7 i α b o d y m c g where x is the instantaneous displacements of the structure in different directions m is the mass of the structure f t o t a l is the total external forces acting on the structure including the wave forces f w a v e frictional force f and gravitational force f g in the sway motion the total horizontal force consists of horizontal wave force and frictional force in the heave motion the total vertical force consists of the vertical wave force and gravitational force i is the mass moment of inertial of the floating body α b o d y is the acceleration of pitch motion m c g represents the total moments acting on the structure the procedure for the wave structure interaction is shown in fig 5 at the beginning of each time step the whole flow domain is solved by the governing equations subsequently the total external forces and moments are gained by using the user defined functions written in c programming language to integrate the pressure and shear stress over all the solid surfaces of the structure after that eqs 6 and 7 are solved simultaneously to get the values of acceleration then the structure moves with the new velocities with the motion responses the structure moves to a new position in the meantime the velocities of the body are assigned to the surrounding overset meshes the component of overset mesh moves in specified motions together with the structure in each time step if the final time step is reached the solver ends otherwise the solver is ready for the next time step 2 5 experimental verification currently there are few studies presenting time histories of motion responses of bridge deck driven by periodic wave forces in the experiments to validate the proposed model the experimental data about the motion displacements of a floating inverse t type structure acting by wave actions is utilized zhao et al 2012 the inverse t type structure consists of a deck and a rectangular superstructure which is quite similar to a component of the t type girder bridge deck the schematic of the numerical and experimental setup for the inverse t type structure is shown in fig 6 as seen in fig 6 the floating body is free to heave and pitch while the sway motion is restrained by springs the elastic coefficient of the spring k 3 82 n m the wave period t 1 s and wave amplitude a 0 0192 m the motion responses of the floating body sway heave and pitch measured in the experiments are adopted to compare with the numerical results in the numerical model model sensitivity tests have been conducted with different grid resolutions and time steps two sets of grid resolutions are utilized in the model with two small time steps i e 0 001 s and 0 0005 s and the results indicate the first set of grid resolution with dt 0 001 s has reached convergence the predicted body motions and transmitted wave monitored by a wave gauge in the front of the body are compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 7 regarding the sway motion the overall lateral displacement first increases in the first stage before reaching the peak value at around t 15 6 s and decrease with the time afterwards in the second stage the sway motion is driven by the combination of wave force and spring force in each wave cycle the body moves forward in the first half wave cycle and backward in the second half wave cycle the spring force is linear with lateral distance thus it is much smaller than wave force in the beginning resulting in the overall increase of lateral distance in each wave cycle within the first stage in the second stage the backward spring force makes a larger contribution than the wave force and the overall lateral distance of the floating structure decreases in each wave cycle as for the predicted heave and pitch motions the floating body moves periodically with the incident wave inferring the simulated results are in accordance with the experimental data small discrepancies appear in the simulated results compared with experimental data which is probably partly attributed to the application of a 2 d model to simulate the 3 d wave structure interaction in the 3 d experiment there are two small gaps between the floating body and glass wall where a certain amount of water could pass through due to the disappearance of gaps in the 2 d model the predicted wave forces change slightly and the minor deviations are transferred to the corresponding motion responses as a result the monitored water surface elevation in the front of the floating body is also well predicted from the comparison between simulated results and experimental data showing the numerical model not only gives an accurate prediction of the instantaneous motion responses but also figures out the reaction of the body to water surface well fig 8 presents the snapshots of wave structure interaction in a wave period the positions of the floating body are set by the numerical results of three motion displacements of the body the floating body stays at its initial place at t 0 when no pitch motion response of the body happens at t 0 0 117t the floating body rotates clockwise under the moments caused by wave action in the meantime a bit of water appears on the left deck of the body which is called green water the body rotates to the maximum angle and begins to rotate counterclockwise between t 0 0 263t to t 0 0 761t after that the floating body moves to the onshore side and returns to its initial position at t 0 0 878t the simulated velocity field distribution is also shown in fig 8 the maximum velocity mainly exists around the floating body as more wave energy concentrates on the water surface the processes of vortex generation and dissipation are clearly presented around the sharp corners of the floating body the vortexes are caused by the combined effect of the boundary layer around the solid surface and the fiercely nonlinear wave structure interaction where pitch response plays a significant role when the body rotates under wave action flow separation at the sharp corners is easily induced by the viscous effect which has also been validated in jung et al 2005 it is noteworthy that the vortexes do not always follow the rotation direction of the body inferring phase lags exist the distributed area of vortex in the onshore side is larger than the offshore side which is attributed to the existence of twin vortexes overall the proposed model gives a good prediction of the velocity field around the body 3 lateral responses of movable t deck and box deck the numerical domain is built based on the wave flume experiment at oregon state university bradner 2008 as shown in fig 3 the bridge deck was placed in the water tank and the distance between the bottom soffit of the girders and the seabed is 1 89 m to represent the relative distance between the still water level and the bottom of the girders a dimensionless number d is expressed as 8 d d z d h d where d is the water depth close to the bridge z d is the distance between the bottom soffit of the girders and the seabed 1 89 m h d is the thickness of the bridge deck 0 28 m the shape of box girders is designed based on the typical bridge located in the coastal area of china to study the influence of girder type on the lateral response the width and height of the deck are the same in these two types as shown in fig 9 values of d ranges from 1 0 to 4 0 with an increment of 0 5 in the later discussion we use t deck and box deck to represent t type girder deck and box girder deck respectively to have a deep insight into the failure mechanisms of two decks a parametric study with different hydrodynamic parameters is then conducted a total of 54 cases are designed for the numerical experiment as shown in table 2 the relevant parameters in the numerical experiments are set to be within a broad range including various wave conditions the wave period t i ranging from 2 0 to 4 0 s the wave height h i ranging from 0 4 to 0 8 m d ranging from 1 0 to 4 0 and the corresponding relative distance between swl to soffit bottom of girders ranging from 0 28 to 1 12 m 3 1 wave deck interaction though instantaneous lateral displacements of bridge decks under periodic wave actions are lack some snapshots of the wave deck interaction in the experiment are available which is suited for the comparison of snapshots between numerical results and experiment data chen et al 2016b in the experiment the bridge is free to sway without any spring constraint in the lateral direction the hydrodynamic parameters are the same as case 9 in table 2 the wave height h i is 0 8 m and the wave period t i is 4 0 s the non dimensional parameter d is 0 5 which means the bottom of the bridge deck is higher than the still water level and the bridge is partially submerged in the water the total mass of the t deck is 1940 kg fig 10 a and b presents the experimental and simulated wave deck interaction of t deck and six typical snapshots t t 0 0 14t t 0 0 235t t 0 0 325t t 0 0 423t t 0 0 545t and t 0 0 648t in one of the wave periods are included the distribution of water velocity around the bridge deck and flow path of entrapped air between the girders are contained in the subfigures at t t 0 0 14t the incident wave with a large amount of energy concentrated on the wave crest reaches the offshore side of the bridge deck and begins to hit the offshore girder under the shear stress air vortexes are formed in five cavities between six girders and a part of the air escapes at the same time at t t 0 0 235t the incident wave hits the bridge girder on the offshore side and quickly climbs up the bridge deck meanwhile the bridge moves suddenly to the onshore side under the action of lateral wave force as the bridge moves the water spray on the onshore side of the bridge is induced as a result which was clearly shown in both simulated results and experimental images at t t 0 0 325t a portion of the incident wave flows above the bridge deck inferring the green water phenomenon occurs and the other portion of the wave transmits beneath the girders under the action of gravity it is noteworthy that the amount of water above the bridge deck in the numerical model is slightly larger than that in the experiment which is mainly attributed to the adoption of the 2 d model in the 3 d experiment a small part of the water passes through the gaps between decks and water tank walls which is clearly shown in the second experimental subfigure thus the volume of water climbing up the bridge deck reduces which is slightly different from the 2 d model the air between the girders is trapped at t t 0 0 235t to t 0 0 325t and no air escapes at t t 0 0 423t the portion of water above the bridge deck begins to flow back to the wave tank at the onshore side of the deck and the water surface rises to the same elevation as the deck surface which is clearly shown in both laboratory and simulated subfigures as the water surface elevation decreases on the offshore side the air in the first cavity exposes to the outer space while the air in the other cavities is still entrapped at t t 0 0 423t to t 0 0 648t the remaining water above the deck continues to drop resulting in the waterfall phenomenon at the onshore side of the deck in the process more air cavities are exposed to the outer space overall the phenomenon of highly nonlinear wave deck interaction is captured fairly well by the present numerical model fig 10 c also presents the interaction between wave and box deck in a wave period for comparison in the first subfigure the air beneath box girders escapes as the incident wave propagates which is similar to the findings in t deck however the big difference is that no air is entrapped under the box deck as no cavities exist in the structure with box girders later the box deck moves when the incident wave collides with the deck the phenomena of green water and waterfall are also witnessed in the later snapshots vortex forms in the lower left part of the box deck at t t 0 0 423t expands at t t 0 0 545t and recedes at t 0 0 648t however these vortexes under the box girders are all exposed to outer space which is quite different from t deck as seen in fig 10 the shape of the bridge deck has a significant influence on the wave deck interaction fig 11 presents the simulated lateral displacements of two bridge decks under the action of incident waves it is seen the lateral displacements of two decks both increase with time in a step by step fashion the lateral motion is decided by resultant horizontal force which is dependent on horizontal wave force and friction the deck only moves when the horizontal wave force is larger than the frictional force thus the time history of lateral displacement is composed of numbers of stairs and each stair means the sway motion in a wave cycle the average dimensionless lateral displacement in one period is 0 315 and 0 259 for t deck and box deck respectively inferring the t deck experiences a fiercer lateral response in the specified condition to illustrate the difference in sway responses between two decks fig 12 gives the instantaneous lateral displacement and external forces acting on the bridge decks in a wave cycle as shown in the first subfigure the motion duration of t deck is longer than box deck besides the increased rate of lateral displacement in t deck is larger than box deck as the motion response is determined by the difference between horizontal wave force and frictional force the time histories of two forces are presented in the second and third subfigures respectively it is seen the horizontal wave force acting on t deck lasts longer than box deck the friction acting on two decks shown in the last subfigure first increases and then decreases with time which is closely correlated with uplift wave forces acting on the decks to better understand the results in fig 12 six snapshots in fig 10 are drawn in line to mark different instants in one period namely t a t f the biggest difference between two decks is found in t b stage when the t deck is undergoing quick sway response while the moving box deck is going to stop as the horizontal wave force reduces quickly at t b stage the offshore and onshore sides of box deck are both acted by water pressure while only offshore side of t deck is acted by water pressure as the water spray is induced in the onshore side the horizontal force acting on t deck is larger than box deck which is caused by the pressure difference of offshore surface and onshore surface as shown in fig 10 the water spray on the onshore side of t deck is correlated with the deck motion and the existence of entrapped air laboratory monitors of wave forces acting on elevated bridge decks indicate that the time histories of wave forces are composed of two components i e the short duration slamming force and slowly varying quasi static force douglass et al 2007 bradner et al 2011 guo et al 2015 huang et al 2018a it is shown in fig 12 that the component of slamming force is apparent in both horizontal wave force and frictional force for t deck and box deck as frictional force is proportional to the difference between deck weight and vertical wave force the slamming component in frictional force reflects what the slamming component is like in vertical wave force it is noteworthy that the number of slamming oscillations in the two decks is different in box deck the slamming oscillation appears before the happen of maximum quasi steady force which is similar to the phenomenon in an elevated deck with flat bottom sheppard and marin 2009 in t deck multiple slamming component exists in the curve inferring the magnitude and duration of the slamming force is modified which is attributed to the formation of air pocket induced by the air entrapment between the wave surface and slab of t deck the number of slamming oscillations in a fixed t deck is theoretically equal to the air cavity number sheppard and marin 2009 however only four oscillations are clearly observed in the time histories for the movable t deck with five cavities six girders which was attributed to the fierce energy dissipation between the progressive wave and movable t deck as the slamming component is well captured by the current model it indicates the time step used in the model is small enough to accurately capture the air movement under the t deck bozorgnia and lee 2012 it is seen the average lateral displacement of t deck is larger than box deck meaning the t deck is more likely to fall into the water from the cap in the specified elevated condition and the corresponding repair cost is higher than the box deck to give a direct comparison of between dynamic wave deck interactions between the two decks under various conditions the influences of three essential hydrodynamic parameters d t i h i on lateral displacements of the two bridge decks are studied in the following 3 2 influence of d on lateral displacement numbers of bridge decks located in biloxi bay were destroyed by surface waves caused by hurricane katrina in 2005 xiao et al 2010 studied the effects of submersion depth on uplift wave force acting on the t deck in biloxi bay and found that the bridge submersion significantly influenced the uplift force thus bridge stability under the wave action was affected the criterion to judge whether the bridge deck is damaged is based on the difference between deck weight and uplift force if the uplift force is greater than deck weight the bridge is classified as damage the criterion is reasonable as the bridge deck is assumed to be fixed under the external forces in the numerical model of xiao et al 2010 nevertheless the motion response of the bridge deck is not only associated with the uplift wave force but also affected by the horizontal wave force the bridge deck is displaced along with the pile cap as long as the horizontal wave force is larger than frictional force no matter whether the uplift force is larger or smaller than the deck weight numerical simulations are therefore carried out to study the effect of submersion depth on wave deck interaction and the simulated results for t deck and box deck are shown in fig 13 the ordinate value is the dimensionless average lateral displacement in a wave cycle and the abscissa value is the deck submergence measured by d the elevated bridge deck locates above the mean water surface when d 0 when d 0 the elevation of still water level swl rises to the bottom of the girders when d 0 the bridge deck is partially or fully submerged in the still water as shown in fig 13 two peak values are found in the curve of t deck and only one peak value is apparent in the curve of box deck when d 1 the lateral displacement is close to zero meaning the maximum horizontal wave force is just slightly larger than the friction and the bridge decks almost remain stationary overall the lateral displacements for two decks first increase and then decrease with submersion depth the first peak value for t deck appears when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water d 0 5 and the second peak value occurs when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water d 1 5 2 0 the peak value for box deck only appears when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water d 2 0 fig 13 presents the comparison of wave deck interactions for t deck and box deck when bridge decks are semi submerged in the water and seven typical snapshots t t 0 0 02t t 0 0 15t t 0 0 318t t 0 0 415t t 0 0 478t t 0 0 555t and t 0 0 750t in one of the wave periods are included the information of water velocity distribution around the bridge deck and flow path of entrapped air between girders are contained in the subfigures similar to the wave deck interaction of elevated decks shown in fig 10 the incident wave with a large amount of energy hit the offshore sides of the structures and the decks move under the joint action of wave forces and frictional forces when the horizontal wave force is smaller than the maximum frictional force the bridge keeps stationary when the t deck is semi submerged in the water the duration of trapped air t 0 0 15t t 0 0 318t t 0 0 415t t 0 0 478t t 0 0 555t in the cavities between six girders are much longer than the case in elevated t deck t 0 0 235t t 0 0 325t it is also interesting to see that the entrapped air only forms vortexes at the beginning and end of the duration t 0 0 15t t 0 0 555t which is caused by the shear stress when the water surface elevation rises and decrease quickly for semi submerged box deck no air is trapped under the decks the vortexes only exist in the lower left part of the box deck at t t 0 0 555t and t 0 0 750t which is similar to the finding in the elevated case to illustrate the difference of lateral responses between two shapes and explain the reason why the first peak value of lateral displacement of t deck appears fig 15 gives the instantaneous lateral displacement and external forces acting on the bridge decks in a wave cycle not only does the motion duration of t deck lasts longer than box deck but also the increased rate is faster in t deck the second and third subfigures give the time histories of simulated horizontal wave force and friction in a wave cycle compared with the elevated case the slamming forces decrease in semi submerged cases which is in accordance with the findings in earlier studies sheppard and marin 2009 chen et al 2020 there are several reasons that sway displacement of t deck is larger than box deck when the deck is semi submerged first the maximum horizontal wave force acting on t deck is much larger than box deck second the duration of positive horizontal wave force acting on t deck is longer than box deck inferring the t deck undergoes a longer movement third the friction acting on two decks exhibits some differences in the time instances of t c t f as shown in figs 12 and 15 the peak value of sway response for semi submerged t deck is not attributed to the change of horizontal wave force on the contrary the maximum horizontal wave force acting on the deck submerged in the water is smaller than the force acting on the elevated deck the first peak value of lateral displacement of t deck is caused by the reduction of frictional force which is correlated with the large uplift force it is seen the air is entrapped in all five cavities for t deck in fig 14 which plays a vital role in increasing the uplift wave force fig 16 presents the comparison of wave deck interaction for t deck and box deck when bridge decks are fully submerged in the water and seven typical snapshots t t 0 0 018t t 0 0 128t t 0 0 25t t 0 0 378t t 0 0 5t t 0 0 678t and t 0 0 875t in one of the wave periods are presented at the initial state the incident wave hits the bridge girder on the offshore side and quickly climbs up the bridge deck t 0 0 018t to t 0 0 128t the bridge decks move in the onshore direction and green water appears on both sides of the deck surface t 0 0 25t which is quite different from the elevated deck in the air and the semi submerged deck in the water subsequently the green water on the two sides collides above the deck surface at t t 0 0 378t as shown in fig 16 a large amount of green water is always on the bridge deck surface in a wave cycle meaning the decks are completely immersed in the water even during the passage of the wave trough when d 2 0 as the space in the five cavities is not exposed to the outer air environment in all wave cycle no air is entrapped between the t type girders inferring the generation of uplift wave force is not associated with entrapped air which is different from the elevated deck in the air and semi submerged deck in the water to illustrate the difference of sway responses between two decks and explain the reason why peak lateral displacements of t deck and box deck both appear fig 17 gives the instantaneous lateral displacements and external forces acting on the bridge decks in a wave cycle as shown in the first subfigure the motion duration of t deck is shorter than box deck besides the increased rate of lateral displacement in t deck is slightly lower than box deck according to the impulse momentum theorem the momentum of deck equals the resultant impulse acting on it a fiercer lateral motion response of box deck shown in the first subfigure indicates the impulse acting on the box deck is larger than t deck however the total onshore positive impulse on box deck caused by horizontal wave force is smaller than t deck as shown in the second subfigure thus the impulse in the offside negative direction caused by the frictional force acting on the t deck must be larger than box deck which is demonstrated in the third subfigure at d 2 0 two decks are all fully immersed in the water during the passage of incident wave the buoyancy forces caused by the displaced water volume reach a maximum and the frictional forces reduce to a minimum as a result the maximum buoyancy remains almost the same when the structure is fully submerged because it is only proportional to water volume displacement as the still water surface elevation continues to increase at a larger value of d the resultant horizontal wave force decreases as more wave energy is distributed on the water surface the lateral displacement thereafter decreases hence the peak values of lateral displacement for two decks appear at d 2 0 to eliminate the influence of weight the weights of t deck and box deck are assumed to be the same in the numerical simulation however the displacement of water volume by t deck is smaller than box deck as it is hollow in the inner of box deck as shown in fig 8 thus the buoyancy of the box deck is larger than t deck and the induced lateral displacement of box deck is larger as a result at d 2 0 xiao et al 2010 studied the influence of submersion depth on uplift wave force acting on t deck and found only one peak value in the curve of uplift wave force varied with submersion depth in this section two peak values for t deck are found in the curve of lateral displacement varied with submersion depth it is worth noting the second peak value is smaller than the first peak value and the reason is that the total impulse caused by the difference of horizontal wave force and friction in the semi submerged state is larger than that in the fully submerged case in conclusion the t deck is easiest to be displaced by the wave when it is half or just fully submerged the box deck is easiest to be displaced by the wave when it is just fully submerged the t deck is easier to be displaced than the box deck when the decks are not fully immersed in the water and vice versa 3 3 influence of wave period on lateral displacement for incident progressive wave the energy contained in the wave is proportional to the wavelength which is positively correlated with wave period additionally different wave periods also mean a different duration of wave deck interaction which has a big influence on the lateral motion the hydrodynamic environment is absolutely contrasting within different wave periods and numerous researches have been done to study the effect of wave period on wave loading acting on fixed bridge decks e g bradner 2008 bradner et al 2011 azadbakht 2013 fang et al 2019 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 in this section lateral displacements for two bridge decks with various wave period for a constant wave height h i 0 7 m and two submergence depths d 0 5 2 5 is presented the wave period varies between 2 0 s and 4 0 s with an interval of 0 5 s the influence of wave period on the lateral displacement for t deck and box deck with two submersion depths is shown in fig 18 the results indicate that the relation between lateral displacement and period is complicated which highly depends on the submersion depth and girder type for t deck the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave period when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water at d 0 5 however the lateral displacement changes irregularly with the time period when the bridge deck is totally submerged in the water at d 2 0 for box deck at d 0 5 the deck only moves when the wave period is 4 0 s and almost keeps stationary within smaller wave periods when the box deck is fully submerged in the water at d 2 5 the relation between the lateral displacement and the incident wave period is parabolic with a peak value the lateral displacement is directly determined by the resultant horizontal force acting on it according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 the wave force equals to the summation of drag force and inertia force as shown in eq 9 when the structure length is relatively small compared with the wavelength the morison equation is applicable to assess the wave forces on the structure when the structure width is comparable with wavelength the calculation of morison equation may not be accurate enough to overcome the limitation sheppard and marin 2009 presented a semi empirical parametric model for the wave force based on the morison equation using the experimental data from the laboratory experiments and the force is given in eq 10 9 f t o t a l f d r a g f i n e r t i a 1 2 c d ρ a v 2 c m m v t 10 f t o t a l f d r a g f i n e r t i a 1 2 c d ρ a v 2 c m m v t v m t where a is the cross sectional area of the bridge deck perpendicular to the wave propagation direction v is the water velocity c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively v t is the water acceleration and m t is the change rate of the effective mass with time as shown in eqs 9 and 10 the wave forces are positively correlated with both water velocity and acceleration according to the linear wave theory water velocity increases and water acceleration decreases with an increment of wave period or wavelength and vice versus for a decrement of wave period or wavelength when the incident wave period increases in fig 18 the water velocity increases and water acceleration decreases leading to the uncertainty of the trend of wave force thus the correlation between lateral displacement and wave period is not simply linear or quadratic but influenced by many other hydrodynamic parameters in the experiment of a fixed bridge deck bradner 2008 the monitored horizontal forces acting on bridge decks are also not merely positive or negative with wave period inferring the study of wave deck interaction in a range of wave period is a necessity though the relation between lateral displacement and wave period is complicated the motion response at a short wave period is sure to be relatively small it is shown two bridge decks semi submerged in the water at d 0 5 almost keep stationary when the wave period is 2 s to give an insight into the wave deck interaction for semi submerged t deck at t i 2 s fig 19 gives six snapshots of the interaction within one wave cycle it is seen that the wave deck interaction at this wave period is somewhat similar to what is observed in a large wave period interestingly the phenomenon of entrapped air does not always mean obvious deck motion as air is always trapped in several cavities between the girders in a wave cycle fig 20 gives the instantaneous external forces acting on the t deck in a wave cycle indicating the maximum friction is always larger than horizontal wave force as the friction is proportional to the difference between bridge weight and uplift wave force the large friction in a wave cycle means the uplift wave force does not significantly reduce the resultant vertical force the uplift wave force consists of two parts i e the buoyancy caused by the self volume and the component uplift force from entrapped air the entrapped air phenomenon is obvious which indicates a certain contribution to the uplift wave force has been made by the entrapped air however it is found the deck is seldom fully surrounded by water pressure in a cycle inferring the buoyancy caused by the displaced water volume is significantly reduced which is the main reason for a relatively small uplift wave force in conclusion the horizontal wave force is hard to overcome the large friction when the buoyancy does not obviously contribute to the uplift force as shown in fig 18 a big difference between t deck and box deck is that the motion response of box deck semi submerged in the water only moves with a large wave period at t i 4 0 s and almost keeps stationary at smaller wave periods fig 21 presents the wave deck interaction of box deck in one wave period it is seen the deck is fully or partially elevated in the air within most of the wave cycle the deck is partially submerged in the water only at t t 0 0 27t to t 0 0 35t fig 22 gives the instantaneous external horizontal forces acting on the box deck in a wave cycle inferring the friction force approach minimum at the time instance between t t 0 0 27t to t 0 0 35t when the deck is partially submerged in the water the deck motion is simultaneously determined by horizontal wave force and friction though the friction approaches minimum at subfigure c and subfigure d the bridge deck is not able to move apparently as the horizontal wave force is relatively small at this moment the horizontal wave force reaches a maximum when the incident wave just approaches the offshore side of the deck and directly hits the offshore girder at t t 0 0 16t however as the uplift force acting on the deck is relatively small the horizontal wave force is not able to overcome the frictional force at the initial collision thus the bridge deck almost keeps stationary at this moment different from t deck the uplift force on box deck is mainly contributed by buoyancy other than the combined effect of buoyancy and entrapped air in total if the wave period is not large enough the uplift force mainly induced by buoyancy is significantly affected the box deck can hardly be displaced as a result 3 4 influence of wave height on lateral displacement for incident progressive wave the energy contained in the wave is not only proportional to the wavelength but also proportional to the square of wave height through the field inspection in hurricane katrina the significant wave height varied in a wide range smith 2007 currently a number of researches in experimental and numerical models have been done to study the influence of wave height on wave forces acting on fixed bridge decks e g bradner et al 2011 bozorgnia et al 2010 azadbakht 2013 fang et al 2019 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 in this section the influence of wave height on lateral displacement for two decks is discussed as shown in fig 23 overall the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave height for two bridge decks within two submersion depths an increase in wave height always means the larger wave energy contained in incident waves with the same duration of wave deck interaction horizontal and uplift wave forces acting on fixed decks have been found to be approximately linearly correlated with the wave height in previous researches e g hayatdavoodi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 as the external forces increase with wave height the lateral response subsequently becomes fiercer what is noteworthy is that the positive relation between lateral displacement and wave height is valid only when the horizontal wave force in the specified wave height is large enough to overcome the frictional force when the bridge deck is elevated in the air at d 0 5 the decks only move when the wave height exceeds 0 6 m when the bridge deck is just submerged in the water at d 1 0 the box deck is able to move in any wave height while the t deck only moves when the wave height is larger than 0 5 m which is because the contribution of entrapped air on uplift force is lack when the t deck is just submerged in the water 4 conclusions in this paper a numerical model simulating dynamic wave structure interaction is firstly proposed and validated by existing experimental data indicating the numerical methodology based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations rng k ϵ turbulence model and the vof method is capable of simulating the instantaneous fierce interaction subsequently a total of 54 numerical experiments are carried out to study the lateral displacements of t deck and box deck under various wave conditions and the findings with several conclusions are summarized as follows two peak values are found in the curve of lateral displacement versus dimensionless submersion depth for t deck while one peak value is found in the curve for box deck when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water or elevated in the air the lateral displacement of t deck is mostly larger than box deck when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water the lateral displacement of t deck is mostly smaller than box deck the relations between lateral displacement and period for two decks are both uncertain which highly depends on the submersion depth and girder type for t deck the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave period when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water and changes irregularly with time period when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water for box deck the deck only moves when the wave period is large enough in the semi submerged condition and the relation between the lateral displacement and the wave period appears parabolic in the fully submerged condition the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave height for two bridge decks which is only valid when the horizontal wave force in the specified wave height is large enough to overcome the frictional force the final state of bridge deck in the extreme wave can be classified into three types i e fixed state partially displaced state and falling down state and the repair cost after the damage varies significantly among different bridge deck states one of the mitigation strategies for the bridge decks is to minimize the lateral deck displacement and the comparative study of lateral displacements of t deck and box deck under various wave conditions is essentially important in the bridge engineering for example the most vulnerable conditions for t deck happens when the deck is semi submerged in the still water and a reduction of lateral displacement for t deck transferring from the falling down state to partially displaced state is helpful in reducing the repair cost and improving the recovery speed the same goes for box deck when the deck is just fully submerged in the still water additionally it is found the air under the box deck does not help to improve the uplift wave force just as the critical role of the entrapped air plays in t deck the uplift force on box deck is mainly contributed by the buoyancy other than the joint effect of buoyancy and entrapped air to reduce the lateral displacement engineers are suggested to focus on the escape route of the entrapped air for t deck and a reduction of the displaced water volume for box deck the limitations of the current study and future work are described as follows 1 to save the computational cost a 2 d model is utilized to simplify the computational domain in the paper however the 2 d model may not fully capture all the features in the process of wave deck interaction the air in the cavities can only escape in the wave propagation direction in the 2 d simulations while the air is also able to escape in the direction of wave tank width besides the 3 d bridge railings and diaphragms can also be taken into consideration in a 3 d model therefore more realistic results are expected in a 3 d model which requires more powerful computational capabilities 2 stokes waves are usually adopted to represent the hurricane induced wave and the solitary waves are most adopted to represent the tsunami induced wave in the previous studies for a comprehensive comparison between two bridge decks under the extreme wave forces the researches on the wave deck interactions of t deck and box deck in solitary waves are expected to be carried out in future works credit authorship contribution statement xuebin chen formal analysis manuscript

20740,extreme wave forces have damaged massive coastal bridges in the past decades to the best knowledge of the authors a direct comparison of dynamic wave deck interactions between t type and box girder decks under the same wave conditions has not been studied this paper establishes a numerical model solving the navier stokes equations for viscous and incompressible free surface flows which is verified by existing experimental data a total of 54 numerical experiments based on this model are then carried out to investigate the dynamic responses of two bridge decks under various wave conditions and the influences of hydrodynamic parameters on the wave deck interaction are studied two peak values are found in the curve of lateral displacement versus dimensionless submersion depth for the t type girder deck while one peak value is found in the curve for the box girder deck the relations between lateral displacement and period for two decks are both uncertain which highly depends on the submersion depth and girder type the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave height for two bridge decks which is only valid when the horizontal wave force in the specified wave height is large enough to overcome the frictional force this study provides researchers an insight into the difference of instantaneous lateral displacement between two most commonly used cross section shapes of bridge deck and helps to further understand the fragility of t type and box girder decks under extreme waves author keywords t type girder deck box girder deck wave deck interaction wave forces 1 introduction coastal bridges are vulnerable to damage by extreme ocean surface waves and massive coastal highway bridges have been damaged in the past decades in hurricane ivan 2004 84 t type girder bridge spans from the eastbound and the westbound fell into the water from the support structure and 19 bridge spans were displaced at varying distance from their initial positions over escambia bay in hurricane katrina 2005 a total of 58 t type girder bridge spans were completely removed from their support structures and more than 379 spans were laterally displaced varying distances sheppard and marin 2009 field observations showed the bridge decks were in three states after the disaster i e fixed state partially displaced state and falling down state in the fixed state the bridge deck remains stationary and no displacement happens when the wave force surpasses the structure capacities and the connection between the bridge deck and substructure failures the bridge deck moves on the pile cap and it is called the partially displaced state if the final position of the bridge deck is on the support structure if the lateral deck displacement is large the deck fell into the water from the support structure and it is called the falling down state the repair cost changes with the lateral deck displacement especially within different states padgett et al 2008 besides it takes much more time for the relocation of bridges in the falling down state compared with the partially displaced state which significantly affects the recovery speed thus the investigations of wave forces on the bridge decks and the lateral deck displacement help to further understand the fragility of t type and box girder decks under extreme waves so far numerous experiments have been carried out to investigate the wave forces acting on coastal bridge decks e g douglass et al 2006 sugimoto and unjoh 2007 bradner 2008 mcpherson 2008 cuomo et al 2009 sheppard and marin 2009 bradner et al 2011 lau et al 2011 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 seiffert et al 2015a guo et al 2015 chen et al 2016 xiao and guo 2019 huang et al 2018 huang et al 2019 fang et al 2019 zhu and dong 2020 bradner 2008 conducted a large scale laboratory observation of wave forces on a typical section of the i 10 bridge over escambia bay that failed during hurricane ivan in 2004 and the experimental data were analyzed to study the relation among impulse load horizontal forces and vertical forces fang et al 2019 investigated the wave forces on coastal t type girder bridge decks subjected to oblique wave attack and found the vertical wave force reached the peak at a wave angle of 30 under a clearance of 4 0 cm showing the wave overtopping had a significant effect on the vertical force in the semi submerged and submerged cases based on the experimental data numerous empirical equations were proposed for engineering applications to get a quick estimation of the wave forces e g mcconnell et al 2004 douglass et al 2006 cuomo et al 2007 aashto 2008 chen et al 2009 liu et al 2019 as empirical equations are only applicable to specified structures and wave conditions the machine learning technique has been regarded as an efficient way to predict the wave forces after lots of experimental and simulated data are gained e g xu et al 2018a b xu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 proposed an approach for sequentially updating surrogate models with augmented data in civil engineering and the message gained through the limited computational experimental effort is maximized with the rapid development of computer technology numerical simulation of the wave deck interaction by computational fluid dynamics cfd has gained popularity for it provides the researchers an approach to studying the instantaneous interaction e g huang and xiao 2009 bozorgnia and lee 2012 azadbakht and yim 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 xu and cai 2014 seiffert et al 2015a chen et al 2016a xu et al 2018a b qu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 zhu and dong 2020 chen et al 2020 huang and xiao 2009 utilized a numerical model based on the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations to investigate dynamic wave forces exerted on the t type girder bridge deck located in escambia bay damaged in hurricane ivan and got the time histories of wave profiles turbulent velocity fields dynamic uplift and horizontal forces xu and cai 2014 used the cfd method to study the wave forces acting on the curved bridge with inclination angles from 10 to 10 in biloxi bay indicating the bridge deck inclination affected time histories of wave forces significantly through the time histories of forces gained by the cfd method one can judge whether the bridge deck is going to be damaged in extreme waves most of the researchers mentioned above focused on the typical t type girder deck which is widely used in regions of the eastern pacific especially in the coastal zones of north america nevertheless the t type girder deck has the shortcomings of low load bearing capability and large workload of installation engineers in modern days tend to use the box girder deck in long span coastal bridges especially in the coastal areas of china where massive new coastal bridges are under construction as shown in fig 1 the wave deck interaction between t type and box girder deck may be quite different as the geometric shape is totally different which suffers from the water pressure acted by incident wave besides the entrapped air in the cavities formed by t type girders has a significant role in enhancing the vertical wave load on bridge deck bricker and nakayama 2014 seiffert et al 2015b qu et al 2017 while no cavity exists in the box type girder deck hayashi 2013 conducted waterway experiments to study the wave force acting on a fixed box girder bridge deck and some parameters were investigated including wave height flow velocity and inclination the experimental results showed the wave forces varied with these three parameters except that the moment remained almost the same with inclinations from 0 to 2 86 huang et al 2018 used experimental and numerical methods to study the wave forces on box girder bridge decks with various wave heights and submergence coefficients it is found the impulse force should not be neglected in the design of the box girder deck as the maximum impulse force could reach two times that of quasi steady force under elevated conditions horizontal and vertical forces increased with the wave height except when the submergence coefficient is equal to zero there is a lack of dynamic studies on the wave deck interaction as it is more complicated and challenging when the deck is movable compared with the fixed deck xu and cai 2015 took bridge vibration under solitary wave forces into consideration and built a single degree of freedom sdof system to study the influence of lateral restraining stiffness effect on bridge deck wave interaction and the motion characteristics of bridge decks with spring restraint driven by stokes waves were studier later in xu and cai 2017 however the model is not applicable to simulating the free motion of bridge decks when the connection structure between the superstructure and substructure fails to simplify the model the frictional force in the sdof caused by the deck and pile cap is neglected avallone et al 2006 indicated the friction coefficient between the bridge deck and the pile caps is usually less than 0 7 and a value of 0 55 was adopted in the study of wave deck interaction by chen et al 2016b bradner et al 2011 conducted a large scale experiment on wave deck interaction and found the peak value of vertical force was approximately three to five times as large as that of horizontal forces as the frictional force equals the product of friction coefficient and deck weight and the peak value of vertical wave force is slighter larger or smaller than deck weight it is found that the frictional force and the horizontal wave force are of the same order of magnitude thus it is highly suggested to take frictional force into consideration when studying the lateral displacement of the bridge deck in the study of fixed bridge deck the structure is judged safe if the uplift force was smaller than the weight however the authors previous research on movable t type girder bridge decks found the bridge was able to move even when the uplift wave force was smaller than the weight as long as the horizontal wave force was larger than the constraint force chen et al 2016b the failure mechanisms of coastal bridges under different extreme wave conditions still require further studies xu and cai 2014 huang et al 2018 2019 to the best knowledge of the authors there are few studies focusing on the freely movable bridge deck to fill the knowledge gap the objective of this paper is to conduct a comparative study on the wave deck interactions for movable t type and box girder decks under stokes waves with the consideration of frictional force and investigate the influences of essential hydrodynamic parameters submersion depth wave period and wave height on lateral displacements of the two bridge decks this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a description of the numerical model built in this paper in section 3 the dynamic model is verified by the experimental data of a freely floating type body driven by stokes waves subsequently the influences of submersion depth wave period and wave height on the sway lateral motions of bridge deck with two shapes are studied and the failure mechanisms for two decks are discussed finally section 4 summarizes the findings with several conclusions 2 model development and experimental verification a two dimensional 2 d numerical model for simulating wave deck interaction in the numerical wave tank nwt is established in the paper the computational fluid dynamics cfd package fluent is chosen as the basic solver in the numerical model the user defined functions udf written in c programming language have been added into the solver to enhance the capability of the package in simulating the movable bridge deck under the wave action in the numerical wave tank wave absorption zones are distributed on both sides of the tank to efficiently absorb the reflected and transmitted waves ensuring the core zone of wave deck interaction is not affected by the reflected wave the relaxation method is utilized in the wave absorption zones and further information about the relaxation method is illustrated in afshar 2010 and chen et al 2017 the volume of fluid vof method has been successfully adopted in capturing the fluctuating water surface e g chen et al 2016b xu et al 2018a b zhao et al 2020 and it is also used in the current model 2 1 governing equations the rng k ϵ is derived using a statistical technique called renormalization group theory compared with the standard k ϵ model the rng k ϵ model is more accurate and reliable for a broader class of flows than the standard k ϵ model orszag et al 1993 thus the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and rng k ϵ turbulence model is used in the paper to simulate the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 i 1 2 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i compared with instantaneous navier stokes

to the mean velocity gradients g b is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to buoyancy y m represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate the quantities α k and α ε are the inverse effective prandtl numbers for k and ϵ respectively s k and s ε are user defined source terms 2 2 numerical wave tank details of some experiments are listed in table 1 which is sorted by the publication date it is seen the experiments are mainly focused on the t type girder deck damaged in the storms of hurricanes ivan 2004 and katrina 2005 in recent years box girder bridge decks have been widely used in the coastal areas of china with the rapid development of highway construction as it has obvious advantages over the t type girder decks and corresponding experiments are being carried out to study the wave forces on box girder bridge decks e g huang et al 2018 huang et al 2019 the scale of bridge models adopted by different researchers ranges from 1 100 to 1 5 which covers a wide range in laboratory experiments it faces numerous challenges to model the complex process of waves acting on highway bridge superstructures the foremost is the recreation of a kinematically similar wave structure interaction in the laboratory bradner et al 2011 if the scale is too small some monitored results e g the effect of trapped air may not be well in accordance with froude criteria cuomo et al 2009 the scale effects of elastic forces due to trapped and or entrained air can be minimized by testing at a large scale model bradner et al 2011 therefore it is a good choice to choose a large scale experiment for the verification of the current numerical model additionally it is seen in table 1 that the dynamic motions of the bridge decks are only considered in the experiments carried out at oregon state university osu thus the experiment with a large scale 1 5 t type girder bridge deck carried out in the laboratory of osu is utilized for the verification where the bridge deck is allowed to move freely in the horizontal lateral direction to study the dynamic properties fig 2 shows the test setups installed in osu s large wave flume and the numerical wave tank built in the paper based on the large scale experiment is shown in fig 3 2 3 mesh update method the overset mesh is utilized to deal with the motions of the bridge deck due to the incident wave in this paper the overset mesh is an effective method of preserving high mesh quality in the duration of fierce wave deck interaction with large motion displacements background and component meshes are established in the methodology different from the traditional mesh update method the two sets of meshes are independent of each other by marking all points inside the boundary and outside the computational domain as the hole points or dead cells the process of hole cutting is done by cutting surfaces to identify the approximation of the overset wall boundary to provide continuous solutions different cell zones are coupled by an interface in the process of hole cutting flow information is transferred from the donor cells to the associated overlapping cell zones the receptors then gain messages from the corresponding overlap cell zone and vice versa fig 4 a gives a schematic drawing of the background mesh zone and the overlapping component after the process of hole cutting in the overset area the extracted flow domain is shown in fig 4 b as the overset meshes move together with the movable structure no mesh deformation occurs in the long period of wave structure interaction regardless of any motion response type when the structure moves the background component keeps stationary in space the coupling between two components is implicit and flow information in the cells of the overlapping region are solved simultaneously by utilizing the discretized governing equations on the overset mesh boundaries in the interpolation method receptor cells within the overset interface receive messages from adjacent donors which can be interpolated by the following equation 5 h i 0 n d w i i where is the solution variable n d is the number of donors and w is the interpolation weights 2 4 numerical implementation the governing equations in fluent are discretized based on the finite volume method fvm pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is used for the pressure velocity coupling with pressure staggering option presto discretization scheme the quadratic upwind interpolation of convective kinematics quick algorithm is used to discretize the momentum convection the procedure for solving the wave structure interaction is described as follows the structure is taken as a rigid body and its motion are solved by the following equations 6 m x f t o t a l 7 i α b o d y m c g where x is the instantaneous displacements of the structure in different directions m is the mass of the structure f t o t a l is the total external forces acting on the structure including the wave forces f w a v e frictional force f and gravitational force f g in the sway motion the total horizontal force consists of horizontal wave force and frictional force in the heave motion the total vertical force consists of the vertical wave force and gravitational force i is the mass moment of inertial of the floating body α b o d y is the acceleration of pitch motion m c g represents the total moments acting on the structure the procedure for the wave structure interaction is shown in fig 5 at the beginning of each time step the whole flow domain is solved by the governing equations subsequently the total external forces and moments are gained by using the user defined functions written in c programming language to integrate the pressure and shear stress over all the solid surfaces of the structure after that eqs 6 and 7 are solved simultaneously to get the values of acceleration then the structure moves with the new velocities with the motion responses the structure moves to a new position in the meantime the velocities of the body are assigned to the surrounding overset meshes the component of overset mesh moves in specified motions together with the structure in each time step if the final time step is reached the solver ends otherwise the solver is ready for the next time step 2 5 experimental verification currently there are few studies presenting time histories of motion responses of bridge deck driven by periodic wave forces in the experiments to validate the proposed model the experimental data about the motion displacements of a floating inverse t type structure acting by wave actions is utilized zhao et al 2012 the inverse t type structure consists of a deck and a rectangular superstructure which is quite similar to a component of the t type girder bridge deck the schematic of the numerical and experimental setup for the inverse t type structure is shown in fig 6 as seen in fig 6 the floating body is free to heave and pitch while the sway motion is restrained by springs the elastic coefficient of the spring k 3 82 n m the wave period t 1 s and wave amplitude a 0 0192 m the motion responses of the floating body sway heave and pitch measured in the experiments are adopted to compare with the numerical results in the numerical model model sensitivity tests have been conducted with different grid resolutions and time steps two sets of grid resolutions are utilized in the model with two small time steps i e 0 001 s and 0 0005 s and the results indicate the first set of grid resolution with dt 0 001 s has reached convergence the predicted body motions and transmitted wave monitored by a wave gauge in the front of the body are compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 7 regarding the sway motion the overall lateral displacement first increases in the first stage before reaching the peak value at around t 15 6 s and decrease with the time afterwards in the second stage the sway motion is driven by the combination of wave force and spring force in each wave cycle the body moves forward in the first half wave cycle and backward in the second half wave cycle the spring force is linear with lateral distance thus it is much smaller than wave force in the beginning resulting in the overall increase of lateral distance in each wave cycle within the first stage in the second stage the backward spring force makes a larger contribution than the wave force and the overall lateral distance of the floating structure decreases in each wave cycle as for the predicted heave and pitch motions the floating body moves periodically with the incident wave inferring the simulated results are in accordance with the experimental data small discrepancies appear in the simulated results compared with experimental data which is probably partly attributed to the application of a 2 d model to simulate the 3 d wave structure interaction in the 3 d experiment there are two small gaps between the floating body and glass wall where a certain amount of water could pass through due to the disappearance of gaps in the 2 d model the predicted wave forces change slightly and the minor deviations are transferred to the corresponding motion responses as a result the monitored water surface elevation in the front of the floating body is also well predicted from the comparison between simulated results and experimental data showing the numerical model not only gives an accurate prediction of the instantaneous motion responses but also figures out the reaction of the body to water surface well fig 8 presents the snapshots of wave structure interaction in a wave period the positions of the floating body are set by the numerical results of three motion displacements of the body the floating body stays at its initial place at t 0 when no pitch motion response of the body happens at t 0 0 117t the floating body rotates clockwise under the moments caused by wave action in the meantime a bit of water appears on the left deck of the body which is called green water the body rotates to the maximum angle and begins to rotate counterclockwise between t 0 0 263t to t 0 0 761t after that the floating body moves to the onshore side and returns to its initial position at t 0 0 878t the simulated velocity field distribution is also shown in fig 8 the maximum velocity mainly exists around the floating body as more wave energy concentrates on the water surface the processes of vortex generation and dissipation are clearly presented around the sharp corners of the floating body the vortexes are caused by the combined effect of the boundary layer around the solid surface and the fiercely nonlinear wave structure interaction where pitch response plays a significant role when the body rotates under wave action flow separation at the sharp corners is easily induced by the viscous effect which has also been validated in jung et al 2005 it is noteworthy that the vortexes do not always follow the rotation direction of the body inferring phase lags exist the distributed area of vortex in the onshore side is larger than the offshore side which is attributed to the existence of twin vortexes overall the proposed model gives a good prediction of the velocity field around the body 3 lateral responses of movable t deck and box deck the numerical domain is built based on the wave flume experiment at oregon state university bradner 2008 as shown in fig 3 the bridge deck was placed in the water tank and the distance between the bottom soffit of the girders and the seabed is 1 89 m to represent the relative distance between the still water level and the bottom of the girders a dimensionless number d is expressed as 8 d d z d h d where d is the water depth close to the bridge z d is the distance between the bottom soffit of the girders and the seabed 1 89 m h d is the thickness of the bridge deck 0 28 m the shape of box girders is designed based on the typical bridge located in the coastal area of china to study the influence of girder type on the lateral response the width and height of the deck are the same in these two types as shown in fig 9 values of d ranges from 1 0 to 4 0 with an increment of 0 5 in the later discussion we use t deck and box deck to represent t type girder deck and box girder deck respectively to have a deep insight into the failure mechanisms of two decks a parametric study with different hydrodynamic parameters is then conducted a total of 54 cases are designed for the numerical experiment as shown in table 2 the relevant parameters in the numerical experiments are set to be within a broad range including various wave conditions the wave period t i ranging from 2 0 to 4 0 s the wave height h i ranging from 0 4 to 0 8 m d ranging from 1 0 to 4 0 and the corresponding relative distance between swl to soffit bottom of girders ranging from 0 28 to 1 12 m 3 1 wave deck interaction though instantaneous lateral displacements of bridge decks under periodic wave actions are lack some snapshots of the wave deck interaction in the experiment are available which is suited for the comparison of snapshots between numerical results and experiment data chen et al 2016b in the experiment the bridge is free to sway without any spring constraint in the lateral direction the hydrodynamic parameters are the same as case 9 in table 2 the wave height h i is 0 8 m and the wave period t i is 4 0 s the non dimensional parameter d is 0 5 which means the bottom of the bridge deck is higher than the still water level and the bridge is partially submerged in the water the total mass of the t deck is 1940 kg fig 10 a and b presents the experimental and simulated wave deck interaction of t deck and six typical snapshots t t 0 0 14t t 0 0 235t t 0 0 325t t 0 0 423t t 0 0 545t and t 0 0 648t in one of the wave periods are included the distribution of water velocity around the bridge deck and flow path of entrapped air between the girders are contained in the subfigures at t t 0 0 14t the incident wave with a large amount of energy concentrated on the wave crest reaches the offshore side of the bridge deck and begins to hit the offshore girder under the shear stress air vortexes are formed in five cavities between six girders and a part of the air escapes at the same time at t t 0 0 235t the incident wave hits the bridge girder on the offshore side and quickly climbs up the bridge deck meanwhile the bridge moves suddenly to the onshore side under the action of lateral wave force as the bridge moves the water spray on the onshore side of the bridge is induced as a result which was clearly shown in both simulated results and experimental images at t t 0 0 325t a portion of the incident wave flows above the bridge deck inferring the green water phenomenon occurs and the other portion of the wave transmits beneath the girders under the action of gravity it is noteworthy that the amount of water above the bridge deck in the numerical model is slightly larger than that in the experiment which is mainly attributed to the adoption of the 2 d model in the 3 d experiment a small part of the water passes through the gaps between decks and water tank walls which is clearly shown in the second experimental subfigure thus the volume of water climbing up the bridge deck reduces which is slightly different from the 2 d model the air between the girders is trapped at t t 0 0 235t to t 0 0 325t and no air escapes at t t 0 0 423t the portion of water above the bridge deck begins to flow back to the wave tank at the onshore side of the deck and the water surface rises to the same elevation as the deck surface which is clearly shown in both laboratory and simulated subfigures as the water surface elevation decreases on the offshore side the air in the first cavity exposes to the outer space while the air in the other cavities is still entrapped at t t 0 0 423t to t 0 0 648t the remaining water above the deck continues to drop resulting in the waterfall phenomenon at the onshore side of the deck in the process more air cavities are exposed to the outer space overall the phenomenon of highly nonlinear wave deck interaction is captured fairly well by the present numerical model fig 10 c also presents the interaction between wave and box deck in a wave period for comparison in the first subfigure the air beneath box girders escapes as the incident wave propagates which is similar to the findings in t deck however the big difference is that no air is entrapped under the box deck as no cavities exist in the structure with box girders later the box deck moves when the incident wave collides with the deck the phenomena of green water and waterfall are also witnessed in the later snapshots vortex forms in the lower left part of the box deck at t t 0 0 423t expands at t t 0 0 545t and recedes at t 0 0 648t however these vortexes under the box girders are all exposed to outer space which is quite different from t deck as seen in fig 10 the shape of the bridge deck has a significant influence on the wave deck interaction fig 11 presents the simulated lateral displacements of two bridge decks under the action of incident waves it is seen the lateral displacements of two decks both increase with time in a step by step fashion the lateral motion is decided by resultant horizontal force which is dependent on horizontal wave force and friction the deck only moves when the horizontal wave force is larger than the frictional force thus the time history of lateral displacement is composed of numbers of stairs and each stair means the sway motion in a wave cycle the average dimensionless lateral displacement in one period is 0 315 and 0 259 for t deck and box deck respectively inferring the t deck experiences a fiercer lateral response in the specified condition to illustrate the difference in sway responses between two decks fig 12 gives the instantaneous lateral displacement and external forces acting on the bridge decks in a wave cycle as shown in the first subfigure the motion duration of t deck is longer than box deck besides the increased rate of lateral displacement in t deck is larger than box deck as the motion response is determined by the difference between horizontal wave force and frictional force the time histories of two forces are presented in the second and third subfigures respectively it is seen the horizontal wave force acting on t deck lasts longer than box deck the friction acting on two decks shown in the last subfigure first increases and then decreases with time which is closely correlated with uplift wave forces acting on the decks to better understand the results in fig 12 six snapshots in fig 10 are drawn in line to mark different instants in one period namely t a t f the biggest difference between two decks is found in t b stage when the t deck is undergoing quick sway response while the moving box deck is going to stop as the horizontal wave force reduces quickly at t b stage the offshore and onshore sides of box deck are both acted by water pressure while only offshore side of t deck is acted by water pressure as the water spray is induced in the onshore side the horizontal force acting on t deck is larger than box deck which is caused by the pressure difference of offshore surface and onshore surface as shown in fig 10 the water spray on the onshore side of t deck is correlated with the deck motion and the existence of entrapped air laboratory monitors of wave forces acting on elevated bridge decks indicate that the time histories of wave forces are composed of two components i e the short duration slamming force and slowly varying quasi static force douglass et al 2007 bradner et al 2011 guo et al 2015 huang et al 2018a it is shown in fig 12 that the component of slamming force is apparent in both horizontal wave force and frictional force for t deck and box deck as frictional force is proportional to the difference between deck weight and vertical wave force the slamming component in frictional force reflects what the slamming component is like in vertical wave force it is noteworthy that the number of slamming oscillations in the two decks is different in box deck the slamming oscillation appears before the happen of maximum quasi steady force which is similar to the phenomenon in an elevated deck with flat bottom sheppard and marin 2009 in t deck multiple slamming component exists in the curve inferring the magnitude and duration of the slamming force is modified which is attributed to the formation of air pocket induced by the air entrapment between the wave surface and slab of t deck the number of slamming oscillations in a fixed t deck is theoretically equal to the air cavity number sheppard and marin 2009 however only four oscillations are clearly observed in the time histories for the movable t deck with five cavities six girders which was attributed to the fierce energy dissipation between the progressive wave and movable t deck as the slamming component is well captured by the current model it indicates the time step used in the model is small enough to accurately capture the air movement under the t deck bozorgnia and lee 2012 it is seen the average lateral displacement of t deck is larger than box deck meaning the t deck is more likely to fall into the water from the cap in the specified elevated condition and the corresponding repair cost is higher than the box deck to give a direct comparison of between dynamic wave deck interactions between the two decks under various conditions the influences of three essential hydrodynamic parameters d t i h i on lateral displacements of the two bridge decks are studied in the following 3 2 influence of d on lateral displacement numbers of bridge decks located in biloxi bay were destroyed by surface waves caused by hurricane katrina in 2005 xiao et al 2010 studied the effects of submersion depth on uplift wave force acting on the t deck in biloxi bay and found that the bridge submersion significantly influenced the uplift force thus bridge stability under the wave action was affected the criterion to judge whether the bridge deck is damaged is based on the difference between deck weight and uplift force if the uplift force is greater than deck weight the bridge is classified as damage the criterion is reasonable as the bridge deck is assumed to be fixed under the external forces in the numerical model of xiao et al 2010 nevertheless the motion response of the bridge deck is not only associated with the uplift wave force but also affected by the horizontal wave force the bridge deck is displaced along with the pile cap as long as the horizontal wave force is larger than frictional force no matter whether the uplift force is larger or smaller than the deck weight numerical simulations are therefore carried out to study the effect of submersion depth on wave deck interaction and the simulated results for t deck and box deck are shown in fig 13 the ordinate value is the dimensionless average lateral displacement in a wave cycle and the abscissa value is the deck submergence measured by d the elevated bridge deck locates above the mean water surface when d 0 when d 0 the elevation of still water level swl rises to the bottom of the girders when d 0 the bridge deck is partially or fully submerged in the still water as shown in fig 13 two peak values are found in the curve of t deck and only one peak value is apparent in the curve of box deck when d 1 the lateral displacement is close to zero meaning the maximum horizontal wave force is just slightly larger than the friction and the bridge decks almost remain stationary overall the lateral displacements for two decks first increase and then decrease with submersion depth the first peak value for t deck appears when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water d 0 5 and the second peak value occurs when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water d 1 5 2 0 the peak value for box deck only appears when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water d 2 0 fig 13 presents the comparison of wave deck interactions for t deck and box deck when bridge decks are semi submerged in the water and seven typical snapshots t t 0 0 02t t 0 0 15t t 0 0 318t t 0 0 415t t 0 0 478t t 0 0 555t and t 0 0 750t in one of the wave periods are included the information of water velocity distribution around the bridge deck and flow path of entrapped air between girders are contained in the subfigures similar to the wave deck interaction of elevated decks shown in fig 10 the incident wave with a large amount of energy hit the offshore sides of the structures and the decks move under the joint action of wave forces and frictional forces when the horizontal wave force is smaller than the maximum frictional force the bridge keeps stationary when the t deck is semi submerged in the water the duration of trapped air t 0 0 15t t 0 0 318t t 0 0 415t t 0 0 478t t 0 0 555t in the cavities between six girders are much longer than the case in elevated t deck t 0 0 235t t 0 0 325t it is also interesting to see that the entrapped air only forms vortexes at the beginning and end of the duration t 0 0 15t t 0 0 555t which is caused by the shear stress when the water surface elevation rises and decrease quickly for semi submerged box deck no air is trapped under the decks the vortexes only exist in the lower left part of the box deck at t t 0 0 555t and t 0 0 750t which is similar to the finding in the elevated case to illustrate the difference of lateral responses between two shapes and explain the reason why the first peak value of lateral displacement of t deck appears fig 15 gives the instantaneous lateral displacement and external forces acting on the bridge decks in a wave cycle not only does the motion duration of t deck lasts longer than box deck but also the increased rate is faster in t deck the second and third subfigures give the time histories of simulated horizontal wave force and friction in a wave cycle compared with the elevated case the slamming forces decrease in semi submerged cases which is in accordance with the findings in earlier studies sheppard and marin 2009 chen et al 2020 there are several reasons that sway displacement of t deck is larger than box deck when the deck is semi submerged first the maximum horizontal wave force acting on t deck is much larger than box deck second the duration of positive horizontal wave force acting on t deck is longer than box deck inferring the t deck undergoes a longer movement third the friction acting on two decks exhibits some differences in the time instances of t c t f as shown in figs 12 and 15 the peak value of sway response for semi submerged t deck is not attributed to the change of horizontal wave force on the contrary the maximum horizontal wave force acting on the deck submerged in the water is smaller than the force acting on the elevated deck the first peak value of lateral displacement of t deck is caused by the reduction of frictional force which is correlated with the large uplift force it is seen the air is entrapped in all five cavities for t deck in fig 14 which plays a vital role in increasing the uplift wave force fig 16 presents the comparison of wave deck interaction for t deck and box deck when bridge decks are fully submerged in the water and seven typical snapshots t t 0 0 018t t 0 0 128t t 0 0 25t t 0 0 378t t 0 0 5t t 0 0 678t and t 0 0 875t in one of the wave periods are presented at the initial state the incident wave hits the bridge girder on the offshore side and quickly climbs up the bridge deck t 0 0 018t to t 0 0 128t the bridge decks move in the onshore direction and green water appears on both sides of the deck surface t 0 0 25t which is quite different from the elevated deck in the air and the semi submerged deck in the water subsequently the green water on the two sides collides above the deck surface at t t 0 0 378t as shown in fig 16 a large amount of green water is always on the bridge deck surface in a wave cycle meaning the decks are completely immersed in the water even during the passage of the wave trough when d 2 0 as the space in the five cavities is not exposed to the outer air environment in all wave cycle no air is entrapped between the t type girders inferring the generation of uplift wave force is not associated with entrapped air which is different from the elevated deck in the air and semi submerged deck in the water to illustrate the difference of sway responses between two decks and explain the reason why peak lateral displacements of t deck and box deck both appear fig 17 gives the instantaneous lateral displacements and external forces acting on the bridge decks in a wave cycle as shown in the first subfigure the motion duration of t deck is shorter than box deck besides the increased rate of lateral displacement in t deck is slightly lower than box deck according to the impulse momentum theorem the momentum of deck equals the resultant impulse acting on it a fiercer lateral motion response of box deck shown in the first subfigure indicates the impulse acting on the box deck is larger than t deck however the total onshore positive impulse on box deck caused by horizontal wave force is smaller than t deck as shown in the second subfigure thus the impulse in the offside negative direction caused by the frictional force acting on the t deck must be larger than box deck which is demonstrated in the third subfigure at d 2 0 two decks are all fully immersed in the water during the passage of incident wave the buoyancy forces caused by the displaced water volume reach a maximum and the frictional forces reduce to a minimum as a result the maximum buoyancy remains almost the same when the structure is fully submerged because it is only proportional to water volume displacement as the still water surface elevation continues to increase at a larger value of d the resultant horizontal wave force decreases as more wave energy is distributed on the water surface the lateral displacement thereafter decreases hence the peak values of lateral displacement for two decks appear at d 2 0 to eliminate the influence of weight the weights of t deck and box deck are assumed to be the same in the numerical simulation however the displacement of water volume by t deck is smaller than box deck as it is hollow in the inner of box deck as shown in fig 8 thus the buoyancy of the box deck is larger than t deck and the induced lateral displacement of box deck is larger as a result at d 2 0 xiao et al 2010 studied the influence of submersion depth on uplift wave force acting on t deck and found only one peak value in the curve of uplift wave force varied with submersion depth in this section two peak values for t deck are found in the curve of lateral displacement varied with submersion depth it is worth noting the second peak value is smaller than the first peak value and the reason is that the total impulse caused by the difference of horizontal wave force and friction in the semi submerged state is larger than that in the fully submerged case in conclusion the t deck is easiest to be displaced by the wave when it is half or just fully submerged the box deck is easiest to be displaced by the wave when it is just fully submerged the t deck is easier to be displaced than the box deck when the decks are not fully immersed in the water and vice versa 3 3 influence of wave period on lateral displacement for incident progressive wave the energy contained in the wave is proportional to the wavelength which is positively correlated with wave period additionally different wave periods also mean a different duration of wave deck interaction which has a big influence on the lateral motion the hydrodynamic environment is absolutely contrasting within different wave periods and numerous researches have been done to study the effect of wave period on wave loading acting on fixed bridge decks e g bradner 2008 bradner et al 2011 azadbakht 2013 fang et al 2019 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 in this section lateral displacements for two bridge decks with various wave period for a constant wave height h i 0 7 m and two submergence depths d 0 5 2 5 is presented the wave period varies between 2 0 s and 4 0 s with an interval of 0 5 s the influence of wave period on the lateral displacement for t deck and box deck with two submersion depths is shown in fig 18 the results indicate that the relation between lateral displacement and period is complicated which highly depends on the submersion depth and girder type for t deck the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave period when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water at d 0 5 however the lateral displacement changes irregularly with the time period when the bridge deck is totally submerged in the water at d 2 0 for box deck at d 0 5 the deck only moves when the wave period is 4 0 s and almost keeps stationary within smaller wave periods when the box deck is fully submerged in the water at d 2 5 the relation between the lateral displacement and the incident wave period is parabolic with a peak value the lateral displacement is directly determined by the resultant horizontal force acting on it according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 the wave force equals to the summation of drag force and inertia force as shown in eq 9 when the structure length is relatively small compared with the wavelength the morison equation is applicable to assess the wave forces on the structure when the structure width is comparable with wavelength the calculation of morison equation may not be accurate enough to overcome the limitation sheppard and marin 2009 presented a semi empirical parametric model for the wave force based on the morison equation using the experimental data from the laboratory experiments and the force is given in eq 10 9 f t o t a l f d r a g f i n e r t i a 1 2 c d ρ a v 2 c m m v t 10 f t o t a l f d r a g f i n e r t i a 1 2 c d ρ a v 2 c m m v t v m t where a is the cross sectional area of the bridge deck perpendicular to the wave propagation direction v is the water velocity c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively v t is the water acceleration and m t is the change rate of the effective mass with time as shown in eqs 9 and 10 the wave forces are positively correlated with both water velocity and acceleration according to the linear wave theory water velocity increases and water acceleration decreases with an increment of wave period or wavelength and vice versus for a decrement of wave period or wavelength when the incident wave period increases in fig 18 the water velocity increases and water acceleration decreases leading to the uncertainty of the trend of wave force thus the correlation between lateral displacement and wave period is not simply linear or quadratic but influenced by many other hydrodynamic parameters in the experiment of a fixed bridge deck bradner 2008 the monitored horizontal forces acting on bridge decks are also not merely positive or negative with wave period inferring the study of wave deck interaction in a range of wave period is a necessity though the relation between lateral displacement and wave period is complicated the motion response at a short wave period is sure to be relatively small it is shown two bridge decks semi submerged in the water at d 0 5 almost keep stationary when the wave period is 2 s to give an insight into the wave deck interaction for semi submerged t deck at t i 2 s fig 19 gives six snapshots of the interaction within one wave cycle it is seen that the wave deck interaction at this wave period is somewhat similar to what is observed in a large wave period interestingly the phenomenon of entrapped air does not always mean obvious deck motion as air is always trapped in several cavities between the girders in a wave cycle fig 20 gives the instantaneous external forces acting on the t deck in a wave cycle indicating the maximum friction is always larger than horizontal wave force as the friction is proportional to the difference between bridge weight and uplift wave force the large friction in a wave cycle means the uplift wave force does not significantly reduce the resultant vertical force the uplift wave force consists of two parts i e the buoyancy caused by the self volume and the component uplift force from entrapped air the entrapped air phenomenon is obvious which indicates a certain contribution to the uplift wave force has been made by the entrapped air however it is found the deck is seldom fully surrounded by water pressure in a cycle inferring the buoyancy caused by the displaced water volume is significantly reduced which is the main reason for a relatively small uplift wave force in conclusion the horizontal wave force is hard to overcome the large friction when the buoyancy does not obviously contribute to the uplift force as shown in fig 18 a big difference between t deck and box deck is that the motion response of box deck semi submerged in the water only moves with a large wave period at t i 4 0 s and almost keeps stationary at smaller wave periods fig 21 presents the wave deck interaction of box deck in one wave period it is seen the deck is fully or partially elevated in the air within most of the wave cycle the deck is partially submerged in the water only at t t 0 0 27t to t 0 0 35t fig 22 gives the instantaneous external horizontal forces acting on the box deck in a wave cycle inferring the friction force approach minimum at the time instance between t t 0 0 27t to t 0 0 35t when the deck is partially submerged in the water the deck motion is simultaneously determined by horizontal wave force and friction though the friction approaches minimum at subfigure c and subfigure d the bridge deck is not able to move apparently as the horizontal wave force is relatively small at this moment the horizontal wave force reaches a maximum when the incident wave just approaches the offshore side of the deck and directly hits the offshore girder at t t 0 0 16t however as the uplift force acting on the deck is relatively small the horizontal wave force is not able to overcome the frictional force at the initial collision thus the bridge deck almost keeps stationary at this moment different from t deck the uplift force on box deck is mainly contributed by buoyancy other than the combined effect of buoyancy and entrapped air in total if the wave period is not large enough the uplift force mainly induced by buoyancy is significantly affected the box deck can hardly be displaced as a result 3 4 influence of wave height on lateral displacement for incident progressive wave the energy contained in the wave is not only proportional to the wavelength but also proportional to the square of wave height through the field inspection in hurricane katrina the significant wave height varied in a wide range smith 2007 currently a number of researches in experimental and numerical models have been done to study the influence of wave height on wave forces acting on fixed bridge decks e g bradner et al 2011 bozorgnia et al 2010 azadbakht 2013 fang et al 2019 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 in this section the influence of wave height on lateral displacement for two decks is discussed as shown in fig 23 overall the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave height for two bridge decks within two submersion depths an increase in wave height always means the larger wave energy contained in incident waves with the same duration of wave deck interaction horizontal and uplift wave forces acting on fixed decks have been found to be approximately linearly correlated with the wave height in previous researches e g hayatdavoodi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 as the external forces increase with wave height the lateral response subsequently becomes fiercer what is noteworthy is that the positive relation between lateral displacement and wave height is valid only when the horizontal wave force in the specified wave height is large enough to overcome the frictional force when the bridge deck is elevated in the air at d 0 5 the decks only move when the wave height exceeds 0 6 m when the bridge deck is just submerged in the water at d 1 0 the box deck is able to move in any wave height while the t deck only moves when the wave height is larger than 0 5 m which is because the contribution of entrapped air on uplift force is lack when the t deck is just submerged in the water 4 conclusions in this paper a numerical model simulating dynamic wave structure interaction is firstly proposed and validated by existing experimental data indicating the numerical methodology based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations rng k ϵ turbulence model and the vof method is capable of simulating the instantaneous fierce interaction subsequently a total of 54 numerical experiments are carried out to study the lateral displacements of t deck and box deck under various wave conditions and the findings with several conclusions are summarized as follows two peak values are found in the curve of lateral displacement versus dimensionless submersion depth for t deck while one peak value is found in the curve for box deck when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water or elevated in the air the lateral displacement of t deck is mostly larger than box deck when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water the lateral displacement of t deck is mostly smaller than box deck the relations between lateral displacement and period for two decks are both uncertain which highly depends on the submersion depth and girder type for t deck the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave period when the bridge deck is semi submerged in the water and changes irregularly with time period when the bridge deck is fully submerged in the water for box deck the deck only moves when the wave period is large enough in the semi submerged condition and the relation between the lateral displacement and the wave period appears parabolic in the fully submerged condition the lateral displacement is positively correlated with the wave height for two bridge decks which is only valid when the horizontal wave force in the specified wave height is large enough to overcome the frictional force the final state of bridge deck in the extreme wave can be classified into three types i e fixed state partially displaced state and falling down state and the repair cost after the damage varies significantly among different bridge deck states one of the mitigation strategies for the bridge decks is to minimize the lateral deck displacement and the comparative study of lateral displacements of t deck and box deck under various wave conditions is essentially important in the bridge engineering for example the most vulnerable conditions for t deck happens when the deck is semi submerged in the still water and a reduction of lateral displacement for t deck transferring from the falling down state to partially displaced state is helpful in reducing the repair cost and improving the recovery speed the same goes for box deck when the deck is just fully submerged in the still water additionally it is found the air under the box deck does not help to improve the uplift wave force just as the critical role of the entrapped air plays in t deck the uplift force on box deck is mainly contributed by the buoyancy other than the joint effect of buoyancy and entrapped air to reduce the lateral displacement engineers are suggested to focus on the escape route of the entrapped air for t deck and a reduction of the displaced water volume for box deck the limitations of the current study and future work are described as follows 1 to save the computational cost a 2 d model is utilized to simplify the computational domain in the paper however the 2 d model may not fully capture all the features in the process of wave deck interaction the air in the cavities can only escape in the wave propagation direction in the 2 d simulations while the air is also able to escape in the direction of wave tank width besides the 3 d bridge railings and diaphragms can also be taken into consideration in a 3 d model therefore more realistic results are expected in a 3 d model which requires more powerful computational capabilities 2 stokes waves are usually adopted to represent the hurricane induced wave and the solitary waves are most adopted to represent the tsunami induced wave in the previous studies for a comprehensive comparison between two bridge decks under the extreme wave forces the researches on the wave deck interactions of t deck and box deck in solitary waves are expected to be carried out in future works credit authorship contribution statement xuebin chen formal analysis manuscript

20741,despite recent moderate oil prices the reduction in fuel oil consumption of voyaging ships has been of great interest ships experience additional resistance from wind and waves in actual seas during their voyages and those added resistance contributes the increase of fuel consumption the accurate prediction of the added resistance is therefore crucial for developing highly energy efficient and low fuel consuming ships ships routinely navigate along pre determined routes between ports and thus relative heading angle is typically not controlled therefore ships can encounter wind and waves coming from any direction however added resistance in oblique direction has less been studied by researchers than that in head seas to predict the operating performance of ships accurately more focus should also be given to added resistance in oblique direction in the present study the motions and added resistance of an lng carrier are estimated by experimental investigations and numerical computations the scaled model ship is towed at a constant forward speed in a square basin and the resistance increase is measured in regular oblique waves potential flow method and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based computational fluid dynamics method are employed to compare the magnitudes of motion and added resistance to those obtained from model test the global trend of motion responses agrees reasonably at all heading angles between the results from experiments and numerical computations in regard to the added resistance however the level of accuracy is less favorable for both numerical methods the discrepancy is further investigated by checking the relevant parameters in potential method roll damping and relative phases the detailed results are discussed and key finding is addressed in the experimental and numerical investigations the magnitude in the transfer function of added resistance due to waves is significant at bow quartering seas in addition the resistance increase appears to be not negligible even at the following and stern quartering seas therefore operating efficiency of a ship can be evaluated appropriately when contribution of all heading angles is properly taken into account to the evaluation of added resistance keywords added resistance oblique waves experimental test potential method rans method lng carrier 1 introduction recently demand of an optimized ship hull to reduce the fuel oil consumption has been increased to achieve energy saving efficiency in operational sea environment a sea margin accounts for the power increase which directly contributes the energy consumption since power increase is mostly induced by wind and waves in actual seas its proper estimation becomes indispensable to boost the energy saving efficiency in the hull form design stage in the past numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted to estimate the added resistance and the efforts on improving the accuracy of the estimation have been constantly made numerical computation is widely used nowadays since it can be used relatively easy than doing experiment panel method based on linear potential flow theory has been one of useful and preferred ways to calculate vessel s motion response and added resistance in waves to this extent rankine panel method has been developed and applied by joncquez et al 2009 kim and kim 2011 shao and faltinsen 2012 sӧding et al 2014 seo et al 2014 and pan et al 2016 lee et al 2017 their efforts confirm the wide validity of the panel method especially to observe the global trend of vessel response in waves at the various loading conditions in practice however most of the panel methods are limited to linear theory and thus are hard to take the nonlinear effect into account as like hull form above mean water level in the short wave range at head and bow quartering seas ship motion is not significant and diffraction of waves around the ship hull dominates the resistance increase basically the panel method assumes the small amplitude of waves and thus reflection by blunt hull is not properly accounted for the accuracy is relatively low and also convergence is slow in shorter wave lengths therefore correction methods have been developed to achieve more accurate estimation in such situations fujii and takahashi 1975 faltinsen et al 1980 tsujimoto et al 2008 liu and papanikolaou 2016 in addition stawave iso 2015 method also adopts the diffraction component in short waves which is currently employed as a standard method to account for the added resistance in speed trial analysis in prediction of the added resistance due to waves computational fluid dynamics cfd method is also widely employed and shows favorable results in recent applications orihara and miyata 2003 guo et al 2012 sadat hosseini et al 2013 hu et al 2014 yang and kim 2016 yoo et al 2020 as the strong advantage in cfd is its availability in larger waves and motions it plays an important role in validating the nonlinear effect which is typically difficult to obtain accurately from the panel methods in addition cfd can provide better insight on local wave effects e g wave elevation and fluid pressure around ships however high demand of computation time still remains to resolve the difficulty in applying cfd in the past most of researches discussed above have focused on the head waves because its absolute magnitude of the added resistance is significant compared to ones from other heading angles also symmetric condition in head wave allows relatively lower cost to calculate ship motion and added resistance in case of oblique seas therefore relatively fewer studies are found fujii and takahashi 1975 carried out model test in all heading directions for a container ship they also developed correcting method in short waves and the comparison was quite good at bow quartering sea tsujimoto et al 2008 improved the correcting formula suggested by fujii and takahashi 1975 the effect of advancing speed is extended to the case of oblique seas and a regression formula is suggested based on the data base papageorgiou stamatis 2013 estimated the added resistance by strip and panel methods bow quartering seas was only considered in the study and results between the two methods were found to be quite favorable chuang and steen 2013 estimated speed loss in regular oblique waves which is induced by added resistance exerted on vessel although as stated in their paper their numerical computation might not so accurate enough they showed even stern quartering wave can induce the speed loss to the vessel liu and papanikolaou 2016 combined maruo s method and their own correction in short waves they improved the prediction results compared against experimental measurements but discrepancy was still noticeable valanto and hong 2015 2017 studied the added resistance of a cruise ship in all heading angles by model tests they successfully analyzed the relation of added resistance and ship motions and also indicated the added resistance sharply varies at shorter waves park et al 2018 2019 have carried out a comparative study on a tanker and a container ship using various numerical methods the results of predicted added resistances were relatively scattered with respect to the different kinds of applied numerical methods despite the recent efforts on many researches regarding the added resistance in oblique seas further sophisticated investigation is demanded to make better understanding on the underlying physics and phenomena coherence between numerical computation and experimental test is still not satisfactory in the present study a series of model test was carried out at a square basin where carriage towed the subject vessel in oblique seas potential based and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation are employed to evaluate the added resistance and the numerical results are compared to the experiment ones heave and pitch motions are reasonably agreed at all heading angles while roll motion shows some discrepancies especially at stern quartering sea in regards to added resistance the global trend of numerical computation is remarkably scattered to the experimental results the discrepancy is further investigated by checking the relevant parameters in potential method as like double body potential and coordinate system and roll damping it is found that roll damping less contributes the added resistance however the added resistance predicted by potential method is highly sensitive to the relevant computational parameters comparison is also made for the time histories of motions from computations and experiment the motion components are observed in different phases which might be a reason of discrepancy in added resistance another interesting finding is that noticeable magnitude of the added resistance at the short wave range is observed at the entire heading angles the magnitudes of added resistance in following and stern quartering sea are as comparable as that in head sea this observation indicates that operating efficiency can be evaluated appropriately when contribution of all heading angles is properly taken into account to the evaluation of added resistance 2 methodology 2 1 test model the test model is contemporarily designed lng carrier having twin skegs the length between perpendiculars lbp is 290m and breadth 45m for real ship the test model is manufactured in 1 60 scale ratio the test model has bilge keel to take the roll damping properly into account the design speed is determined at froude number fn 0 188 and experiments and numerical computations are carried out at this speed the configuration and particulars of the ship hull are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 2 2 experiment experiments were carried out at the ocean engineering basin in korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso at daejeon korea the facility layout is briefly represented in fig 2 the ocean basin is 56m long and 30m wide piston typed wave makers are installed at both longitudinal and lateral sides of the basin the movement of the wave makers in both directions is adequately controlled to generate the wave propagating in target directions wave absorbing plates are installed opposite to the wave makers the configuration of the model ship and towing carriage is pictured in fig 3 the heading angle is defined by the relative angles between advancing direction of ship and wave the model ship is towed towards to the wave makers in the shorter side of basin for head beam and bow quartering seas for following and stern quartering seas the ship is moved away from the wave makers in shorter side of basin the test model was fabricated in 1 60 scale to the parent ship as shown in fig 1 the model ship also includes the rudder at each skeg but propeller is not attached as shown in fig 4 the model ship is connected to the carriage with 4 soft spring lines 2 lines at bow and stern respectively the spring intensity is selected not strong so that natural periods of horizontal motions like surge sway and yaw are made relatively longer than wave period the load cells are attached to each spring to measure the tensions the total resistance is then calculated as the longitudinal component from combination of the measured spring loads the model ship is allowed to have 6 degrees of freedom dof motions the motions are measured by rodym non contact optical measuring system table 2 shows the test matrix including different combination of wave lengths λ and heading angles 8 regular waves are calibrated prior to the model test with ship the non dimensional wave lengths λ l range from 0 3 to 1 2 which is concentrated short and intermediate waves that the ship can typically experience in moderate sea environment during its voyages the wave height is determined 1 40 to its wave length for lower than 1 0 of non dimensional wave length and is reduced to 1 80 at longer waves different heading angles are considered from head to following waves with the interval of 30 at each test run the measured data including waves ship s global motions and tensions were recorded with sampling frequency of 100hz fig 5 shows an example of the measured data which are heave response tension in a spring line and displacement of computerized planar motion carriage cpmc in time the soft spring system gives the weak restoring force moment to 6 dof motion and thus slower natural periods are made for surge sway and yaw tension is more contributed by such horizontal motions so oscillation with longer period is dominantly observed in time histories in contrast wave induced oscillation is dominant for heave since the soft spring system less contributes the restoring force the time window was selected when the cpmc reached to constant speed and induced motions became steady state the motion s transfer functions were defined as first harmonic component of the measured 6 dof motions mean values of tensions in spring lines were calculated and then converted to determine the magnitude of the added resistance by vector sums of the longitudinal components of the spring forces 2 3 numerical method 2 3 1 rankine panel method wish the computer code wish is employed as the potential based method to calculate the added resistance which is developed by seoul national university the details on the theoretical description of wish can be found in kim and kim 2011 lee et al 2017 lee and kim 2020 basically wish adopts the rankine panel method and solves the linearized boundary value problem in time domain the added resistance is calculated by averaging second order mean wave forces in longitudinal direction of the ship table 3 summarizes the condition of heading angles and wave lengths where wish calculates the motions and added resistance the range of non dimensional wave length is selected from 0 3 to 4 0 in order to observe the trend of transfer function in larger range fig 6 shows the example of panel models used for numerical calculations and wave contours obtained from the computation in regular wave since wish employs the linear method the panel models are only made at the wetted part of the hull surface corresponding to calm sea condition for numerical calculations the ambient free surface and wetted part of the hull surface are discretized by 5929 and 2973 panels respectively those numbers are determined from the results of convergence test as found in fig 7 the heave motion is easily converged using lower number of panels however convergence is relatively slow for added resistance and small discrepancy is still observed even the panel number is increased anyway discrepancy is small and thus it is reasonable choice to use the largest number of panels 2973 for body 5929 for free surface those numbers are kept but domain size of free surface is adjusted with respect to the wave length of incoming waves the figure is made to show the results of convergence test and the details about motion and added resistance will be discussed in chapter 3 viscous damping is one of the key parameters to estimate the roll motion appropriately in oblique seas since potential method cannot inherently take viscosity into account the introduction of artificial damping is generally necessary wish can apply the viscous damping linearly proportional to roll velocity and the user defined coefficient can be used for determining the quantity of roll damping in the present study the damping coefficients were determined from roll decay model test in the potential theory it has been of great concern to implement the effect of forward speed accurately in the numerical computation specifically the linearization of steady flow and m term m j which will be discussed in next paragraph and table 4 are known to significantly influence the accuracy of computation zhao and faltinsen 1989 chen and malenica 1989 iwashita and ohkusu 1989 wu 1991 kim 2005 shao and faltinsen 2012 lee and kim 2020 the steady flow induced by ship s forward speed is typically modeled by double body flow if the vessel is blunt joncquez 2009 kim and kim 2011 seo et al 2014 pan et al 2016 lee et al 2017 in the present computation double body linearization is thus employed since lng carrier has blunt and complicated shape especially around bow and stern sides double body theory itself is quite common but its implementation is not much simple for example body boundary integral equation is not valid if the ship has sharp corner shao and faltinsen 2012 to make the computation more accurate and stable researchers have tried to apply different formulation of double body flow and m term for example the boundary value problem can be described by either inertia or a body fixed coordinate system when the body fixed coordinate system is adopted it becomes easy and stable to implement body boundary condition because m term is diminished their formulation is thoroughly investigated by shao and faltinsen 2012 also in lee and kim 2020 and is briefly summarized in table 4 in the table ф φ denote velocity potential of double body flow and waves respectively ζ means the wave elevation and ξ is displacement of 6 degree of freedom motions subscript i and d denote incident and disturbed component of waves g is gravitational acceleration it should be noted that m term m j is only found in inertia coordinate system which is expressed by forward speed u normal vector n on mean wetted surface of ship s b position vector x and double body potential in body fixed coordinate system first order forward speed u 1 is required which is determined by translational displacement of local position δ and global rotation ξ r δ 3 corresponds vertical displacement wish employs the high order panel method and thus ship and free surface is modeled by bi quadratic spline function nevertheless double body potential is allowed to be composed of constant panel model assuming the singularity density is evenly distributed on a panel because lower order is sometimes stable when body surface has locally complicated curvature meanwhile second order derivative of double body potential is observed in free surface boundary condition which also contributes the accuracy of motion and added resistance two different computations are possible whether 2 φ z 2 is included or not the effect of relevant parameters will be discussed in chapter 4 1 2 3 2 rans method star ccm star ccm is one of the most commonly used programs adopting the state of the art cfd techniques the incompressible flow is assumed and the pressure velocity coupling is treated by a widely used semi implicit method for pressure linked equations scheme the governing equation is based on the reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations a two phase flow model has been employed to simulate water and air simultaneously the volume of fluid method has been selected to capture the free surface turbulence is modeled by the k omega shear stress transport with two layer wall treatment to calculate the motion of the freely floating body hydrodynamic forces are updated in time and then mesh arrangement is adapted with respect to the rigid body s motion based on implicit coupling scheme in each cfd simulation the added resistance r aw is calculated by subtracting calm water resistance r calm from the time averaged total resistance r total in waves therefore cfd simulations are required both in calm and regular wave conditions the boundary condition is the same at both simulations in calm water and in waves except no incident wave is applied in calm water simulation the simulation in calm water is made using 2 9 million grids for the total resistance in waves the 5th order stokes wave is implemented for incoming waves and the second order scheme is used for robust time marching the second order scheme is known to simulate the incident wave accurately without dissipation by numerical damping the ship is set to be free to six degrees of freedom motions and four springs are attached to prevent the ship s horizontal drifting the stiffness of spring is made similar to experiment but no additional damping is applied overset mesh is used which consists of moving part overset region that contains target structure and stationary part background region flow information is exchanged at the interface of overset and background regions velocity inlet condition is assigned to upstream downstream bottom and lateral boundaries pressure outlet is assigned to top of the boundary a forcing zone is employed that absorbs the waves through source term of the mass momentum and volume fraction in this region disturbed solution is gradually changed to analytic solution of 5th order stokes wave arne et al 2014 the computation is made using the ship in model scale 1 60 to real ship the size of computational domain is determined with respect to the wave length of incident wave the length of domain is about 1 2 2 3 times to the wavelength in up and down streams and about 1 0 2 5 times in breadth the prism layer is similarly constructed as done in a calm water simulation based on the previous study of cd adapco perić 2012 the cells are distributed at least 80 cells per wavelength and 15 20 cells per wave height to accurately predict the wave propagation and trace the free surface by keeping this way the total number of cells is determined with respect to the heading angle wave length and also domain size the detailed information can be found in table 5 the computational condition of star ccm is determined to observe the global trend of transfer function for motions and added resistance so condition of normalized wave length is not the same to experiment example of the computational grids and simulated wave contours are presented in fig 8 3 results 3 1 motion responses in regular waves motion responses of the subject ship are estimated at regular wave conditions with froude number fn 0 19 the response amplitude operators raos are then compared at figs 9 11 the heading angles cover 0 180 where 180 correspond to head sea in the figures the horizontal axis denotes the normalized wave length λ to lbp l vertical axis presents the normalized values with respect to wave amplitude a kim et al 2019 have carried out the self propulsion tests in head sea using the same ship model but larger scale 1 40 meanwhile their results are also presented to validate the present experiment in case of panel method the motion and added resistance are obtained using body fixed coordinate system constant panel model is selected for double body velocity potential and second derivate of 2 φ z 2 is neglected the reason of choosing these options is more discussed at chapter 4 1 the calculation by star ccm is carried out 60 interval due to the restriction by longer computation time in case of the heave motion the overall trend of all raos agrees reasonably the largest discrepancy between wish and star ccm is observed around normalized wave lengths from 1 0 to 1 5 at this range wish predicts larger heave response than star ccm computations especially at 120 and 180 heading angles at head wave the present experiment slightly overestimates the heave response compared to the results from kim et al 2019 since the absorbing layer in the basin is relatively less effective to longer wave the result might be influenced by reflected waves which can be more easily found in the smaller basin viscous damping plays an important role in finding the maximum response at the resonant roll free roll decay test was carried out prior to the towing test the damping coefficients are obtained from the decay signal of roll and then obtained linearized value is applied to wish calculations star ccm solves rans equations and thus inherently take the viscous damping effects into account in the comparison of roll raos wish favorably agrees with the experimental results but is less accurate at 60 star ccm predicts the roll raos slightly lower than experiment at 60 wish distinctively predicts the occurrence of two peaks in rao one around 1 2 and the other around 0 4 however the peak around 0 4 is less visible in star ccm and experiment the 2nd peak around 0 4 is induced by the increased wave exciting roll moment at this condition longitudinal distribution of wave elevations results in opposite phase at fp and ap positions in pitch raos numerical computations show similar results to experiment at only 120deg wish slightly underestimates the pitch response around peak the reason can be found the different application of basis potential and coordinate system which will be compared precisely in chapter 4 1 3 2 added resistance in regular waves added resistance is also estimated by numerical methods and the comparison is made in fig 12 at head wave the maximum of the added resistance is observed around normalized wave length 1 0 where the vertical motion response is significant star ccm closely predicts the magnitude however the results are much scattered at short wave range star ccm predicts the added resistance larger than experiment while wish shows smallest the location of peak moves to shorter wave lengths as heading angles recedes from head wave in case of 120 star ccm overestimates the added resistance at the wide range of normalized wave lengths in contrast wish shows better agreement at 120 and 150 heading angles at stern quartering and following waves the peak values from experiment become smaller one interesting observation is that the experiment generally predicts the positive added resistance which means that resistance exerts to opposite of vessel s advancing direction even when the incident wave propagates from behind to forward along the vessel this is reasonable because the test ship moves fast with froude number 0 19 and thus can overtake the incident wave coming behind for this issue star ccm also shows the positive resistances at 0 and 60 except for 30deg the magnitude of added resistance in following and stern quartering seas is as comparable as that in bow quartering seas stawave ii iso 2015 is also taken into account at the comparison which is the simplified formula only using ship s principal particulars stawave ii is restrictively allowed within 45 away from head sea and thus is only compared at 180 and 150 heading angles the transfer function of stawave ii is largest at wide range of normalized wave lengths a ship generally sails the sea in moderate environmental condition where wave energy is mostly focused at short waves at those moderate conditions the magnitude of added resistance in oblique seas is as compatible with that in head sea therefore operating efficiency of the ship can be evaluated in an accurate manner when the contribution of heading angle is appropriately counted to added resistance 4 discussion 4 1 effect of steady flow and reference coordinate system in panel method as addressed in chapter 2 3 1 wish provides several options about the way to describe the double body potential and coordinate system for boundary value problem generally it is difficult to designate an appropriate approach which is valid for various cases of ship hull forward speed and heading angles therefore effect of each parameter is investigated to demonstrate suitable approach in the present case the results of motion and added resistance are compared in figs 13 16 with employing different choice of relevant parameters in legend applied coordinate system is named by inertia and body fixed respectively in addition b spline and constant means the way of describing basis potential higher order spline connection or constant model the effect of second derivate of basis potential is also investigated it is quite surprising that the results are significantly influenced by the choice of methodology when boundary value problem is solved in inertia coordinate system roll motion and added resistance are highly influenced by the choice of other parameters furthermore including second order derivative surprisingly increases the transfer function of added resistance the added resistance in head wave is relatively similar to experiment when inertia coordinate system is applied however roll motion in inertial coordinate system looks slightly unreliable transfer function of added resistance in head sea is quite diverged when body fixed coordinate system is used but becomes similar at other heading angles computation becomes stable when motion and added resistance are calculated in body fixed coordinate system when inertia coordinate is selected care is necessary to choose the way of describing double body potential fig 17 compares the wave contour around body when incident wave comes from 120 with normalized wave length λ l 1 0 the contours are made from the result using different coordinate system and solving with or without 2 φ z 2 when the boundary value problem is solved in inertia coordinate system wave contour has sharp variation around stern such a rapidly varying wave counter can lead the numerical computation unstable and thus results would be less accurate it is worthy to emphasize again that the real phenomenon are unique and not dependant on the coordinate system however the numerical treatment is very sensitive to the coordinate system and way of describing the boundary value problem the inclusion of second derivative of double body velocity potential makes the disturbed wave larger near bow area therefore larger added resistance is predicted if the derivative is included the comparison results are not obvious enough to demonstrate which methodology is more favorable in this circumstance choice is made to use body fixed coordinate system because the computation is less sensitive to steady flow in addition second order derivate of basis potential is not included since the added resistance is more accurate when all heading angle are equally considered all the results of potential method presented in chapter 3 are thus selected using body fixed coordinate system without including second derivative of basis potential anyhow it should be emphasized that larger variation can be available with respect to the treatments of velocity potential and boundary value problem 4 2 elementary uncertainty analysis in experiment numerical computations are typically validated by comparing the results with the experiment however the experiment also has a possibility of errors so it is recommended to demonstrate the level of uncertainty in the experiment the uncertainty in the experiment can be defined in two different categories type a and type b iso 1995 ittc 2014 type an uncertainty components are obtained using a method based on statistical analysis of a series of observations type b uncertainty components are obtained by other means where prior experience and professional judgment are port of type b uncertainties there are large numbers of parameters related to the experiment of added resistance as like test model measurement system facility and devices data deduction and number of repetition a stepwise uncertainty analysis has been carried out by park et al 2015 and sogihara et al 2020 regarding the experiment of added resistance in the present study however the information of error sources seems not enough to carry out thorough level of uncertainty analysis therefore only elementary level of uncertainty analysis is carried out by using available parameters of errors the tests are repeated for the selected cases where confirmation is necessary those include the tests in calm water as well as in specific regular waves it corresponds to type an uncertainty that standard deviation of the results comes from repeat tests at each set of repeat tests the ratio of standard deviation to mean value is also summarized an average is calculated from the collected ratios the averaging ratio is then applied to the remaining cases of single runs as error level this could be considered type b uncertainty since judgment is made to define the error level of single runs the normalized coefficient of added resistance c aw is defined as in eq 1 r wave and r calm are measured resistance in regular wave and in calm water respectively when the error sources are only considered for resistances in calm water and regular waves the combined uncertainty u c can be written as like in eq 2 as mentioned above the standard uncertainties of resistances in waves u r wave and in calm water u r calm are obtained from the repeat tests and judgment the expanded uncertainty u is then estimated as like in eq 3 1 c a w r a w l ρ g b 2 a 2 r w a v e r c a l m l ρ g b 2 a 2 2 u c 2 c a w c a w r w a v e u r w a v e 2 c a w r c a l m u r c a l m 2 3 u 2 0 u c c a w fig 18 compares the experimental results with 95 confidence level and numerical ones the error level is larger in shorter wave lengths which is typically expected since the absolute level of measured forces is smaller the result of error analysis indicates that care is necessary to conduct and analyze the model tests the model test in the present study could not be repeated enough due to the limitation of time schedule larger number of repetition is necessary to reduce the error level in model tests 4 3 effect of roll viscous damping one of the noticeable results in the present study is that star ccm overestimates the added resistance at oblique waves like 60 and 120 at this heading angle star ccm also shows discrepancy at roll raos when compared to experiment roll is a lateral component of motions and is less related to added resistance however it is necessary to check the viscous effect is properly realized in cfd simulation the roll decay is simulated in star ccm and the simulation result is compared to the corresponding experimental one the boundary condition used in free decay is not different from the simulation in waves except the incident wave is not applied the symmetry condition is not used and thus domain is made for both direction of portside and starboard of ship the total grid number is about 3 million the roll motion is realized by imposing the instantaneous roll moment to the hull fig 19 compares the time histories and extinction behavior of the roll motion from the extinction curves the peaks are selected as half of the roll height measured from the decay test the selected peaks are linearly fitted using eqs 4 and 5 here φ n denotes the roll angle at n th peak table 6 shows the analyzed roll period and damping coefficients from the extinction fitting star ccm shows slightly longer natural period than experiment however the difference is below 5 in regard to the damping coefficient the linear term determined from star ccm simulation is slightly larger than experiment however the quadratic term is lower in star ccm and thus combined linear damping is quite similar to experiment as consequence the discrepancy observed in the roll raos might be not induced by differently estimated viscous damping 4 φ m φ n 1 φ n 2 5 φ n φ n 1 φ m p qφ m 4 4 magnitude and phase of motions the time histories of motions are compared to find noticeable discrepancy between numerical computation and experiment figs 20 and 21 compare the vertical components of motions in normalized wavelength of 0 6 at 180 and 120 in model test phase of motions could not be measured and defined correctly the crest of incident wave should be defined however disturbed component of waves makes it difficult to extract the incident wave correctly therefore relative difference of phases is compared between experiment and numerical methods in figures time histories of heaves are arranged so that phase of each result becomes the same then phase difference of pitch also roll in 120deg is investigated as can be found in figures peaks of periodic roll and pitch are observed at slightly different time than experiment in addition the mean heave and pitch are estimated slightly different from computation and experiment wish does not allow steady forces in the equation of motion added resistance is then calculated at one computation since calm water resistance is made zero therefore the time histories from wish have zero mean star ccm takes the total wave forces into account to the equation of motion but the steady force might be calculated slightly different the transfer functions of relative phases are made in fig 22 for 120 and 180 at the range of normalized wave length from 0 5 to 1 0 relative phase of pitch is estimated slightly different from numerical computation and experiment at those range the magnitude of heave and pitch is not negligible so different realization of phase is noticeable roll motion is not large in the present cases but the result of different phase is remarkable the different phase distribution can lead to the vertical motion of ships in specific position are different in terms of magnitude and phase in addition different vertical motion is highly related to relative waves which dominantly contributes the added resistance the added resistance is nonlinear quantity which is typically proportional to quadratic or slightly less of wave amplitude therefore it is sensitive to small discrepancies of ship s motions and wave pattern the reason of discrepancy found in added resistance is therefore induced by the mixture of differently estimated local wave pattern relative motion between ship and free surface as well as global loads and motions the present computation shows acceptable

accuracy by numerical methods 5 conclusions experimental and numerical study is carried out to estimate the added resistance of the lng carrier in oblique seas through the comparison and discussion the following conclusions are made 1 heave and pitch motions are reasonably predicted by wish and star ccm at the entire heading angles however roll motion is relatively less accurate especially at stern quartering seas 2 the added resistance estimated by numerical methods is quite scattered at the wide range of wave lengths and heading angles their trend follows that of experiment but further investigation is required to achieve better level of accuracy 3 the motion responses and added resistance are analyzed thoroughly from wish by choosing the coordinate system way of describing double

this is restricted for present study considering an lng carrier with twin skegs and further analysis is required to achieve general conclusion 4 although magnitudes of motions component are similar between numerical methods and experiment their phases are predicted slightly differently added resistance is highly related to the distribution of relative waves around ship therefore different prediction of vertical motion is likely to be estimate the added resistance incorrectly thorough and stepwise study should be continued to increase the level of accuracy credit authorship contribution

efficiency for hull form design their supports are greatly appreciated 
20741,despite recent moderate oil prices the reduction in fuel oil consumption of voyaging ships has been of great interest ships experience additional resistance from wind and waves in actual seas during their voyages and those added resistance contributes the increase of fuel consumption the accurate prediction of the added resistance is therefore crucial for developing highly energy efficient and low fuel consuming ships ships routinely navigate along pre determined routes between ports and thus relative heading angle is typically not controlled therefore ships can encounter wind and waves coming from any direction however added resistance in oblique direction has less been studied by researchers than that in head seas to predict the operating performance of ships accurately more focus should also be given to added resistance in oblique direction in the present study the motions and added resistance of an lng carrier are estimated by experimental investigations and numerical computations the scaled model ship is towed at a constant forward speed in a square basin and the resistance increase is measured in regular oblique waves potential flow method and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based computational fluid dynamics method are employed to compare the magnitudes of motion and added resistance to those obtained from model test the global trend of motion responses agrees reasonably at all heading angles between the results from experiments and numerical computations in regard to the added resistance however the level of accuracy is less favorable for both numerical methods the discrepancy is further investigated by checking the relevant parameters in potential method roll damping and relative phases the detailed results are discussed and key finding is addressed in the experimental and numerical investigations the magnitude in the transfer function of added resistance due to waves is significant at bow quartering seas in addition the resistance increase appears to be not negligible even at the following and stern quartering seas therefore operating efficiency of a ship can be evaluated appropriately when contribution of all heading angles is properly taken into account to the evaluation of added resistance keywords added resistance oblique waves experimental test potential method rans method lng carrier 1 introduction recently demand of an optimized ship hull to reduce the fuel oil consumption has been increased to achieve energy saving efficiency in operational sea environment a sea margin accounts for the power increase which directly contributes the energy consumption since power increase is mostly induced by wind and waves in actual seas its proper estimation becomes indispensable to boost the energy saving efficiency in the hull form design stage in the past numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted to estimate the added resistance and the efforts on improving the accuracy of the estimation have been constantly made numerical computation is widely used nowadays since it can be used relatively easy than doing experiment panel method based on linear potential flow theory has been one of useful and preferred ways to calculate vessel s motion response and added resistance in waves to this extent rankine panel method has been developed and applied by joncquez et al 2009 kim and kim 2011 shao and faltinsen 2012 sӧding et al 2014 seo et al 2014 and pan et al 2016 lee et al 2017 their efforts confirm the wide validity of the panel method especially to observe the global trend of vessel response in waves at the various loading conditions in practice however most of the panel methods are limited to linear theory and thus are hard to take the nonlinear effect into account as like hull form above mean water level in the short wave range at head and bow quartering seas ship motion is not significant and diffraction of waves around the ship hull dominates the resistance increase basically the panel method assumes the small amplitude of waves and thus reflection by blunt hull is not properly accounted for the accuracy is relatively low and also convergence is slow in shorter wave lengths therefore correction methods have been developed to achieve more accurate estimation in such situations fujii and takahashi 1975 faltinsen et al 1980 tsujimoto et al 2008 liu and papanikolaou 2016 in addition stawave iso 2015 method also adopts the diffraction component in short waves which is currently employed as a standard method to account for the added resistance in speed trial analysis in prediction of the added resistance due to waves computational fluid dynamics cfd method is also widely employed and shows favorable results in recent applications orihara and miyata 2003 guo et al 2012 sadat hosseini et al 2013 hu et al 2014 yang and kim 2016 yoo et al 2020 as the strong advantage in cfd is its availability in larger waves and motions it plays an important role in validating the nonlinear effect which is typically difficult to obtain accurately from the panel methods in addition cfd can provide better insight on local wave effects e g wave elevation and fluid pressure around ships however high demand of computation time still remains to resolve the difficulty in applying cfd in the past most of researches discussed above have focused on the head waves because its absolute magnitude of the added resistance is significant compared to ones from other heading angles also symmetric condition in head wave allows relatively lower cost to calculate ship motion and added resistance in case of oblique seas therefore relatively fewer studies are found fujii and takahashi 1975 carried out model test in all heading directions for a container ship they also developed correcting method in short waves and the comparison was quite good at bow quartering sea tsujimoto et al 2008 improved the correcting formula suggested by fujii and takahashi 1975 the effect of advancing speed is extended to the case of oblique seas and a regression formula is suggested based on the data base papageorgiou stamatis 2013 estimated the added resistance by strip and panel methods bow quartering seas was only considered in the study and results between the two methods were found to be quite favorable chuang and steen 2013 estimated speed loss in regular oblique waves which is induced by added resistance exerted on vessel although as stated in their paper their numerical computation might not so accurate enough they showed even stern quartering wave can induce the speed loss to the vessel liu and papanikolaou 2016 combined maruo s method and their own correction in short waves they improved the prediction results compared against experimental measurements but discrepancy was still noticeable valanto and hong 2015 2017 studied the added resistance of a cruise ship in all heading angles by model tests they successfully analyzed the relation of added resistance and ship motions and also indicated the added resistance sharply varies at shorter waves park et al 2018 2019 have carried out a comparative study on a tanker and a container ship using various numerical methods the results of predicted added resistances were relatively scattered with respect to the different kinds of applied numerical methods despite the recent efforts on many researches regarding the added resistance in oblique seas further sophisticated investigation is demanded to make better understanding on the underlying physics and phenomena coherence between numerical computation and experimental test is still not satisfactory in the present study a series of model test was carried out at a square basin where carriage towed the subject vessel in oblique seas potential based and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation are employed to evaluate the added resistance and the numerical results are compared to the experiment ones heave and pitch motions are reasonably agreed at all heading angles while roll motion shows some discrepancies especially at stern quartering sea in regards to added resistance the global trend of numerical computation is remarkably scattered to the experimental results the discrepancy is further investigated by checking the relevant parameters in potential method as like double body potential and coordinate system and roll damping it is found that roll damping less contributes the added resistance however the added resistance predicted by potential method is highly sensitive to the relevant computational parameters comparison is also made for the time histories of motions from computations and experiment the motion components are observed in different phases which might be a reason of discrepancy in added resistance another interesting finding is that noticeable magnitude of the added resistance at the short wave range is observed at the entire heading angles the magnitudes of added resistance in following and stern quartering sea are as comparable as that in head sea this observation indicates that operating efficiency can be evaluated appropriately when contribution of all heading angles is properly taken into account to the evaluation of added resistance 2 methodology 2 1 test model the test model is contemporarily designed lng carrier having twin skegs the length between perpendiculars lbp is 290m and breadth 45m for real ship the test model is manufactured in 1 60 scale ratio the test model has bilge keel to take the roll damping properly into account the design speed is determined at froude number fn 0 188 and experiments and numerical computations are carried out at this speed the configuration and particulars of the ship hull are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 2 2 experiment experiments were carried out at the ocean engineering basin in korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso at daejeon korea the facility layout is briefly represented in fig 2 the ocean basin is 56m long and 30m wide piston typed wave makers are installed at both longitudinal and lateral sides of the basin the movement of the wave makers in both directions is adequately controlled to generate the wave propagating in target directions wave absorbing plates are installed opposite to the wave makers the configuration of the model ship and towing carriage is pictured in fig 3 the heading angle is defined by the relative angles between advancing direction of ship and wave the model ship is towed towards to the wave makers in the shorter side of basin for head beam and bow quartering seas for following and stern quartering seas the ship is moved away from the wave makers in shorter side of basin the test model was fabricated in 1 60 scale to the parent ship as shown in fig 1 the model ship also includes the rudder at each skeg but propeller is not attached as shown in fig 4 the model ship is connected to the carriage with 4 soft spring lines 2 lines at bow and stern respectively the spring intensity is selected not strong so that natural periods of horizontal motions like surge sway and yaw are made relatively longer than wave period the load cells are attached to each spring to measure the tensions the total resistance is then calculated as the longitudinal component from combination of the measured spring loads the model ship is allowed to have 6 degrees of freedom dof motions the motions are measured by rodym non contact optical measuring system table 2 shows the test matrix including different combination of wave lengths λ and heading angles 8 regular waves are calibrated prior to the model test with ship the non dimensional wave lengths λ l range from 0 3 to 1 2 which is concentrated short and intermediate waves that the ship can typically experience in moderate sea environment during its voyages the wave height is determined 1 40 to its wave length for lower than 1 0 of non dimensional wave length and is reduced to 1 80 at longer waves different heading angles are considered from head to following waves with the interval of 30 at each test run the measured data including waves ship s global motions and tensions were recorded with sampling frequency of 100hz fig 5 shows an example of the measured data which are heave response tension in a spring line and displacement of computerized planar motion carriage cpmc in time the soft spring system gives the weak restoring force moment to 6 dof motion and thus slower natural periods are made for surge sway and yaw tension is more contributed by such horizontal motions so oscillation with longer period is dominantly observed in time histories in contrast wave induced oscillation is dominant for heave since the soft spring system less contributes the restoring force the time window was selected when the cpmc reached to constant speed and induced motions became steady state the motion s transfer functions were defined as first harmonic component of the measured 6 dof motions mean values of tensions in spring lines were calculated and then converted to determine the magnitude of the added resistance by vector sums of the longitudinal components of the spring forces 2 3 numerical method 2 3 1 rankine panel method wish the computer code wish is employed as the potential based method to calculate the added resistance which is developed by seoul national university the details on the theoretical description of wish can be found in kim and kim 2011 lee et al 2017 lee and kim 2020 basically wish adopts the rankine panel method and solves the linearized boundary value problem in time domain the added resistance is calculated by averaging second order mean wave forces in longitudinal direction of the ship table 3 summarizes the condition of heading angles and wave lengths where wish calculates the motions and added resistance the range of non dimensional wave length is selected from 0 3 to 4 0 in order to observe the trend of transfer function in larger range fig 6 shows the example of panel models used for numerical calculations and wave contours obtained from the computation in regular wave since wish employs the linear method the panel models are only made at the wetted part of the hull surface corresponding to calm sea condition for numerical calculations the ambient free surface and wetted part of the hull surface are discretized by 5929 and 2973 panels respectively those numbers are determined from the results of convergence test as found in fig 7 the heave motion is easily converged using lower number of panels however convergence is relatively slow for added resistance and small discrepancy is still observed even the panel number is increased anyway discrepancy is small and thus it is reasonable choice to use the largest number of panels 2973 for body 5929 for free surface those numbers are kept but domain size of free surface is adjusted with respect to the wave length of incoming waves the figure is made to show the results of convergence test and the details about motion and added resistance will be discussed in chapter 3 viscous damping is one of the key parameters to estimate the roll motion appropriately in oblique seas since potential method cannot inherently take viscosity into account the introduction of artificial damping is generally necessary wish can apply the viscous damping linearly proportional to roll velocity and the user defined coefficient can be used for determining the quantity of roll damping in the present study the damping coefficients were determined from roll decay model test in the potential theory it has been of great concern to implement the effect of forward speed accurately in the numerical computation specifically the linearization of steady flow and m term m j which will be discussed in next paragraph and table 4 are known to significantly influence the accuracy of computation zhao and faltinsen 1989 chen and malenica 1989 iwashita and ohkusu 1989 wu 1991 kim 2005 shao and faltinsen 2012 lee and kim 2020 the steady flow induced by ship s forward speed is typically modeled by double body flow if the vessel is blunt joncquez 2009 kim and kim 2011 seo et al 2014 pan et al 2016 lee et al 2017 in the present computation double body linearization is thus employed since lng carrier has blunt and complicated shape especially around bow and stern sides double body theory itself is quite common but its implementation is not much simple for example body boundary integral equation is not valid if the ship has sharp corner shao and faltinsen 2012 to make the computation more accurate and stable researchers have tried to apply different formulation of double body flow and m term for example the boundary value problem can be described by either inertia or a body fixed coordinate system when the body fixed coordinate system is adopted it becomes easy and stable to implement body boundary condition because m term is diminished their formulation is thoroughly investigated by shao and faltinsen 2012 also in lee and kim 2020 and is briefly summarized in table 4 in the table ф φ denote velocity potential of double body flow and waves respectively ζ means the wave elevation and ξ is displacement of 6 degree of freedom motions subscript i and d denote incident and disturbed component of waves g is gravitational acceleration it should be noted that m term m j is only found in inertia coordinate system which is expressed by forward speed u normal vector n on mean wetted surface of ship s b position vector x and double body potential in body fixed coordinate system first order forward speed u 1 is required which is determined by translational displacement of local position δ and global rotation ξ r δ 3 corresponds vertical displacement wish employs the high order panel method and thus ship and free surface is modeled by bi quadratic spline function nevertheless double body potential is allowed to be composed of constant panel model assuming the singularity density is evenly distributed on a panel because lower order is sometimes stable when body surface has locally complicated curvature meanwhile second order derivative of double body potential is observed in free surface boundary condition which also contributes the accuracy of motion and added resistance two different computations are possible whether 2 φ z 2 is included or not the effect of relevant parameters will be discussed in chapter 4 1 2 3 2 rans method star ccm star ccm is one of the most commonly used programs adopting the state of the art cfd techniques the incompressible flow is assumed and the pressure velocity coupling is treated by a widely used semi implicit method for pressure linked equations scheme the governing equation is based on the reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations a two phase flow model has been employed to simulate water and air simultaneously the volume of fluid method has been selected to capture the free surface turbulence is modeled by the k omega shear stress transport with two layer wall treatment to calculate the motion of the freely floating body hydrodynamic forces are updated in time and then mesh arrangement is adapted with respect to the rigid body s motion based on implicit coupling scheme in each cfd simulation the added resistance r aw is calculated by subtracting calm water resistance r calm from the time averaged total resistance r total in waves therefore cfd simulations are required both in calm and regular wave conditions the boundary condition is the same at both simulations in calm water and in waves except no incident wave is applied in calm water simulation the simulation in calm water is made using 2 9 million grids for the total resistance in waves the 5th order stokes wave is implemented for incoming waves and the second order scheme is used for robust time marching the second order scheme is known to simulate the incident wave accurately without dissipation by numerical damping the ship is set to be free to six degrees of freedom motions and four springs are attached to prevent the ship s horizontal drifting the stiffness of spring is made similar to experiment but no additional damping is applied overset mesh is used which consists of moving part overset region that contains target structure and stationary part background region flow information is exchanged at the interface of overset and background regions velocity inlet condition is assigned to upstream downstream bottom and lateral boundaries pressure outlet is assigned to top of the boundary a forcing zone is employed that absorbs the waves through source term of the mass momentum and volume fraction in this region disturbed solution is gradually changed to analytic solution of 5th order stokes wave arne et al 2014 the computation is made using the ship in model scale 1 60 to real ship the size of computational domain is determined with respect to the wave length of incident wave the length of domain is about 1 2 2 3 times to the wavelength in up and down streams and about 1 0 2 5 times in breadth the prism layer is similarly constructed as done in a calm water simulation based on the previous study of cd adapco perić 2012 the cells are distributed at least 80 cells per wavelength and 15 20 cells per wave height to accurately predict the wave propagation and trace the free surface by keeping this way the total number of cells is determined with respect to the heading angle wave length and also domain size the detailed information can be found in table 5 the computational condition of star ccm is determined to observe the global trend of transfer function for motions and added resistance so condition of normalized wave length is not the same to experiment example of the computational grids and simulated wave contours are presented in fig 8 3 results 3 1 motion responses in regular waves motion responses of the subject ship are estimated at regular wave conditions with froude number fn 0 19 the response amplitude operators raos are then compared at figs 9 11 the heading angles cover 0 180 where 180 correspond to head sea in the figures the horizontal axis denotes the normalized wave length λ to lbp l vertical axis presents the normalized values with respect to wave amplitude a kim et al 2019 have carried out the self propulsion tests in head sea using the same ship model but larger scale 1 40 meanwhile their results are also presented to validate the present experiment in case of panel method the motion and added resistance are obtained using body fixed coordinate system constant panel model is selected for double body velocity potential and second derivate of 2 φ z 2 is neglected the reason of choosing these options is more discussed at chapter 4 1 the calculation by star ccm is carried out 60 interval due to the restriction by longer computation time in case of the heave motion the overall trend of all raos agrees reasonably the largest discrepancy between wish and star ccm is observed around normalized wave lengths from 1 0 to 1 5 at this range wish predicts larger heave response than star ccm computations especially at 120 and 180 heading angles at head wave the present experiment slightly overestimates the heave response compared to the results from kim et al 2019 since the absorbing layer in the basin is relatively less effective to longer wave the result might be influenced by reflected waves which can be more easily found in the smaller basin viscous damping plays an important role in finding the maximum response at the resonant roll free roll decay test was carried out prior to the towing test the damping coefficients are obtained from the decay signal of roll and then obtained linearized value is applied to wish calculations star ccm solves rans equations and thus inherently take the viscous damping effects into account in the comparison of roll raos wish favorably agrees with the experimental results but is less accurate at 60 star ccm predicts the roll raos slightly lower than experiment at 60 wish distinctively predicts the occurrence of two peaks in rao one around 1 2 and the other around 0 4 however the peak around 0 4 is less visible in star ccm and experiment the 2nd peak around 0 4 is induced by the increased wave exciting roll moment at this condition longitudinal distribution of wave elevations results in opposite phase at fp and ap positions in pitch raos numerical computations show similar results to experiment at only 120deg wish slightly underestimates the pitch response around peak the reason can be found the different application of basis potential and coordinate system which will be compared precisely in chapter 4 1 3 2 added resistance in regular waves added resistance is also estimated by numerical methods and the comparison is made in fig 12 at head wave the maximum of the added resistance is observed around normalized wave length 1 0 where the vertical motion response is significant star ccm closely predicts the magnitude however the results are much scattered at short wave range star ccm predicts the added resistance larger than experiment while wish shows smallest the location of peak moves to shorter wave lengths as heading angles recedes from head wave in case of 120 star ccm overestimates the added resistance at the wide range of normalized wave lengths in contrast wish shows better agreement at 120 and 150 heading angles at stern quartering and following waves the peak values from experiment become smaller one interesting observation is that the experiment generally predicts the positive added resistance which means that resistance exerts to opposite of vessel s advancing direction even when the incident wave propagates from behind to forward along the vessel this is reasonable because the test ship moves fast with froude number 0 19 and thus can overtake the incident wave coming behind for this issue star ccm also shows the positive resistances at 0 and 60 except for 30deg the magnitude of added resistance in following and stern quartering seas is as comparable as that in bow quartering seas stawave ii iso 2015 is also taken into account at the comparison which is the simplified formula only using ship s principal particulars stawave ii is restrictively allowed within 45 away from head sea and thus is only compared at 180 and 150 heading angles the transfer function of stawave ii is largest at wide range of normalized wave lengths a ship generally sails the sea in moderate environmental condition where wave energy is mostly focused at short waves at those moderate conditions the magnitude of added resistance in oblique seas is as compatible with that in head sea therefore operating efficiency of the ship can be evaluated in an accurate manner when the contribution of heading angle is appropriately counted to added resistance 4 discussion 4 1 effect of steady flow and reference coordinate system in panel method as addressed in chapter 2 3 1 wish provides several options about the way to describe the double body potential and coordinate system for boundary value problem generally it is difficult to designate an appropriate approach which is valid for various cases of ship hull forward speed and heading angles therefore effect of each parameter is investigated to demonstrate suitable approach in the present case the results of motion and added resistance are compared in figs 13 16 with employing different choice of relevant parameters in legend applied coordinate system is named by inertia and body fixed respectively in addition b spline and constant means the way of describing basis potential higher order spline connection or constant model the effect of second derivate of basis potential is also investigated it is quite surprising that the results are significantly influenced by the choice of methodology when boundary value problem is solved in inertia coordinate system roll motion and added resistance are highly influenced by the choice of other parameters furthermore including second order derivative surprisingly increases the transfer function of added resistance the added resistance in head wave is relatively similar to experiment when inertia coordinate system is applied however roll motion in inertial coordinate system looks slightly unreliable transfer function of added resistance in head sea is quite diverged when body fixed coordinate system is used but becomes similar at other heading angles computation becomes stable when motion and added resistance are calculated in body fixed coordinate system when inertia coordinate is selected care is necessary to choose the way of describing double body potential fig 17 compares the wave contour around body when incident wave comes from 120 with normalized wave length λ l 1 0 the contours are made from the result using different coordinate system and solving with or without 2 φ z 2 when the boundary value problem is solved in inertia coordinate system wave contour has sharp variation around stern such a rapidly varying wave counter can lead the numerical computation unstable and thus results would be less accurate it is worthy to emphasize again that the real phenomenon are unique and not dependant on the coordinate system however the numerical treatment is very sensitive to the coordinate system and way of describing the boundary value problem the inclusion of second derivative of double body velocity potential makes the disturbed wave larger near bow area therefore larger added resistance is predicted if the derivative is included the comparison results are not obvious enough to demonstrate which methodology is more favorable in this circumstance choice is made to use body fixed coordinate system because the computation is less sensitive to steady flow in addition second order derivate of basis potential is not included since the added resistance is more accurate when all heading angle are equally considered all the results of potential method presented in chapter 3 are thus selected using body fixed coordinate system without including second derivative of basis potential anyhow it should be emphasized that larger variation can be available with respect to the treatments of velocity potential and boundary value problem 4 2 elementary uncertainty analysis in experiment numerical computations are typically validated by comparing the results with the experiment however the experiment also has a possibility of errors so it is recommended to demonstrate the level of uncertainty in the experiment the uncertainty in the experiment can be defined in two different categories type a and type b iso 1995 ittc 2014 type an uncertainty components are obtained using a method based on statistical analysis of a series of observations type b uncertainty components are obtained by other means where prior experience and professional judgment are port of type b uncertainties there are large numbers of parameters related to the experiment of added resistance as like test model measurement system facility and devices data deduction and number of repetition a stepwise uncertainty analysis has been carried out by park et al 2015 and sogihara et al 2020 regarding the experiment of added resistance in the present study however the information of error sources seems not enough to carry out thorough level of uncertainty analysis therefore only elementary level of uncertainty analysis is carried out by using available parameters of errors the tests are repeated for the selected cases where confirmation is necessary those include the tests in calm water as well as in specific regular waves it corresponds to type an uncertainty that standard deviation of the results comes from repeat tests at each set of repeat tests the ratio of standard deviation to mean value is also summarized an average is calculated from the collected ratios the averaging ratio is then applied to the remaining cases of single runs as error level this could be considered type b uncertainty since judgment is made to define the error level of single runs the normalized coefficient of added resistance c aw is defined as in eq 1 r wave and r calm are measured resistance in regular wave and in calm water respectively when the error sources are only considered for resistances in calm water and regular waves the combined uncertainty u c can be written as like in eq 2 as mentioned above the standard uncertainties of resistances in waves u r wave and in calm water u r calm are obtained from the repeat tests and judgment the expanded uncertainty u is then estimated as like in eq 3 1 c a w r a w l ρ g b 2 a 2 r w a v e r c a l m l ρ g b 2 a 2 2 u c 2 c a w c a w r w a v e u r w a v e 2 c a w r c a l m u r c a l m 2 3 u 2 0 u c c a w fig 18 compares the experimental results with 95 confidence level and numerical ones the error level is larger in shorter wave lengths which is typically expected since the absolute level of measured forces is smaller the result of error analysis indicates that care is necessary to conduct and analyze the model tests the model test in the present study could not be repeated enough due to the limitation of time schedule larger number of repetition is necessary to reduce the error level in model tests 4 3 effect of roll viscous damping one of the noticeable results in the present study is that star ccm overestimates the added resistance at oblique waves like 60 and 120 at this heading angle star ccm also shows discrepancy at roll raos when compared to experiment roll is a lateral component of motions and is less related to added resistance however it is necessary to check the viscous effect is properly realized in cfd simulation the roll decay is simulated in star ccm and the simulation result is compared to the corresponding experimental one the boundary condition used in free decay is not different from the simulation in waves except the incident wave is not applied the symmetry condition is not used and thus domain is made for both direction of portside and starboard of ship the total grid number is about 3 million the roll motion is realized by imposing the instantaneous roll moment to the hull fig 19 compares the time histories and extinction behavior of the roll motion from the extinction curves the peaks are selected as half of the roll height measured from the decay test the selected peaks are linearly fitted using eqs 4 and 5 here φ n denotes the roll angle at n th peak table 6 shows the analyzed roll period and damping coefficients from the extinction fitting star ccm shows slightly longer natural period than experiment however the difference is below 5 in regard to the damping coefficient the linear term determined from star ccm simulation is slightly larger than experiment however the quadratic term is lower in star ccm and thus combined linear damping is quite similar to experiment as consequence the discrepancy observed in the roll raos might be not induced by differently estimated viscous damping 4 φ m φ n 1 φ n 2 5 φ n φ n 1 φ m p qφ m 4 4 magnitude and phase of motions the time histories of motions are compared to find noticeable discrepancy between numerical computation and experiment figs 20 and 21 compare the vertical components of motions in normalized wavelength of 0 6 at 180 and 120 in model test phase of motions could not be measured and defined correctly the crest of incident wave should be defined however disturbed component of waves makes it difficult to extract the incident wave correctly therefore relative difference of phases is compared between experiment and numerical methods in figures time histories of heaves are arranged so that phase of each result becomes the same then phase difference of pitch also roll in 120deg is investigated as can be found in figures peaks of periodic roll and pitch are observed at slightly different time than experiment in addition the mean heave and pitch are estimated slightly different from computation and experiment wish does not allow steady forces in the equation of motion added resistance is then calculated at one computation since calm water resistance is made zero therefore the time histories from wish have zero mean star ccm takes the total wave forces into account to the equation of motion but the steady force might be calculated slightly different the transfer functions of relative phases are made in fig 22 for 120 and 180 at the range of normalized wave length from 0 5 to 1 0 relative phase of pitch is estimated slightly different from numerical computation and experiment at those range the magnitude of heave and pitch is not negligible so different realization of phase is noticeable roll motion is not large in the present cases but the result of different phase is remarkable the different phase distribution can lead to the vertical motion of ships in specific position are different in terms of magnitude and phase in addition different vertical motion is highly related to relative waves which dominantly contributes the added resistance the added resistance is nonlinear quantity which is typically proportional to quadratic or slightly less of wave amplitude therefore it is sensitive to small discrepancies of ship s motions and wave pattern the reason of discrepancy found in added resistance is therefore induced by the mixture of differently estimated local wave pattern relative motion between ship and free surface as well as global loads and motions the present computation shows acceptable agreement to experiment in the perspective of motion responses while added resistance requires better estimation the thorough and stepwise study is consistently required to increase the level of accuracy by numerical methods 5 conclusions experimental and numerical study is carried out to estimate the added resistance of the lng carrier in oblique seas through the comparison and discussion the following conclusions are made 1 heave and pitch motions are reasonably predicted by wish and star ccm at the entire heading angles however roll motion is relatively less accurate especially at stern quartering seas 2 the added resistance estimated by numerical methods is quite scattered at the wide range of wave lengths and heading angles their trend follows that of experiment but further investigation is required to achieve better level of accuracy 3 the motion responses and added resistance are analyzed thoroughly from wish by choosing the coordinate system way of describing double body velocity potential and inclusion exclusion of second order derivate the better estimation is available when body fixed coordinate system is employed and double body potential is neglected however this is restricted for present study considering an lng carrier with twin skegs and further analysis is required to achieve general conclusion 4 although magnitudes of motions component are similar between numerical methods and experiment their phases are predicted slightly differently added resistance is highly related to the distribution of relative waves around ship therefore different prediction of vertical motion is likely to be estimate the added resistance incorrectly thorough and stepwise study should be continued to increase the level of accuracy credit authorship contribution

20742,extreme waves with large wave heights may cause the biomass loss and catastrophic damage to the offshore fish cage this study investigates the hydrodynamic response of fish cage under extreme waves focused waves based on the newwave theory are simulated to represent such extreme waves in this study based on the lumped mass model the fish cage is numerically simulated to analyze the motion and load characteristics in extreme waves the results indicate that the fish cage volume dramatically decreases in extreme waves the extreme wave results in large motions and mooring loads different extreme wave crest locations give rise to different net cage responses the fish cage attacked at the leeward side suffers from larger motions and mooring loads than the upwind side with the increase of the steepness surge motions and mooring loads sharply increase the preceding waves before the highest crest greatly influence the peak values of motions and loads results imply that not only the crest location but also the load histories should be carefully examined when investigating the extreme response keywords fish cage extreme waves hydrodynamic response crest location volume loss 1 introduction the safety and survivability of the offshore aquacultural fish cage in extreme environmental conditions are of great importance the extreme waves correspond to the severe waves with respect to the significant wave height which are represented as rogue freak waves according to the definition of kharif et al 2009 the freak wave refers to the wave with the maximum wave crest height twice larger than the significant wave height the freak waves have been reported in both the ocean and coastal zones nikolkina and didenkuluva 2011 chien et al 2012 the unpredictable giant waves appear in sudden and occur in both moderate and severe sea states clauss et al 2003 the risks posed by extreme waves have recently been highlighted by a series of structural incidents with some resulting in fatalities kharif et al 2009 rudman and cleary 2013 the loss and damage caused by extreme waves prove the importance of the freak wave in the design phase of offshore structures for the elastic fish cage that is made of the composite material with less strength than the steel made offshore structures the potential extreme wave during their lifetime would lead to the structural failure and the biomass loss the assessment of the performance of offshore structures under extreme waves represents the important contribution to the structural design it is therefore of interest to investigate the response characteristics of the fish cage in extreme waves theoretical numerical and experimental methods have been done to throw light on the generation of the extreme waves as a simplified and efficient approach which is derived based on the first order stokes expansion the quasi determinism theory proposed by boccotti 1981 has been widely used in coastal and ocean engineering tromans et al 1991 further reformulated the formula and developed the newwave theory the approach efficiently generates the extreme wave at the predefined time instant and the focal location in a relatively short time series to simulate the randomness of the sea state and consider the wave profile around the focal space and time taylor et al 1997 further embedded a random background sea state in the newwave to obtain the constrained newwave cnw based on the newwave theory the deterministic functions calculating the surface elevation and the velocity potential in the space time domain can be explicitly derived the quasi determinism and newwave theory have been verified by some experiment and field measurements boccotti 2011 taylor et al 1997 ning et al 2009 bennett et al 2012 goteman et al 2015 hann et al 2018 as for the interaction between the quasi determinism wave with the structures numerous studies have been carried out cassidy et al 2001 and mirzadeh et al 2016 adopted the newwave to investigate the fixed jacket and proved its efficiency for predicting the short term extreme values gao et al 2020 employed the newwave to numerically analyze the transient gap resonance between two fixed boxes feng et al 2020 experimentally simulated the newwave and analyzed high harmonic wave loads and moments on a vertical cylinder rameeza et al 2020 used the newwave to estimate the impact load on the fixed offshore platform deck from the literature survey provided earlier it is noted that by this method the focused wave can be sufficiently and successfully considered in this study the newwave theory is adopted to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the fish cage system regarding to the dynamic response of the fish cages enormous

measurement the model tests and the numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the dynamic response of the fish cages in waves and currents although the previous studies have improved significantly our understanding of the response of fish cage few studies are related to the response of the fish cage in extreme wave conditions in this study the dynamic response of the fish cage under extreme waves is numerically investigated using the developed time domain numerical model of the fish cage the motions volume and the mooring loads of the cage system in extreme waves are analyzed the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the modeling of the extreme waves and briefly introduces the numerical model of the fish cage section 3 presents the hydrodynamic response of the fish cage in the extreme waves and analyzes the sensitivity of the response to extreme wave crest locations and wave steepness in the last section conclusions and future works are summarized 2 methodology 2 1 wave modeling the extreme wave is generated based on the newwave theory in this study it is a quasi deterministic method with the consideration of the spectral composition of the seas theoretically the newwave theory assumes the gaussian random process of the wave surface elevation and derives the extreme event at the predefined time instant and focal position based on tromans et al 1991 the wave elevation η nw at the location x of the newwave can be expressed as 1 η nw x x 0 t t 0 α r x t α σ 2 i 1 n s ω i d ω cos k i x x 0 ω i t t 0 where α is the crest elevation of the newwave r x t is the unit newwave k i represents the wavenumber and ω i represents the angular frequency of the ith frequency component σ is the standard deviation corresponding to the wave spectrum s ω i represents the spectrum x x 0 and t t 0 represent the distance and time relative to the focal time and position x 0 is the location of the highest crest and t 0 is the focal time of the newwave crest by the user defined time and position relative to the fish cage the fish cage attacked by the newwave crest at different times and positions can be simulated to incorporate a newwave within a background irregular wave taylor et al 1997 and cassidy et al 2001 mathematically derived the cnw the cnw profile is coincided with the newwave profile at the focal time instant t t0 and gradually tending to the random wave statistically the resulting cnw profile is indistinguishable from the original random series although the constrained method slightly alters the shape of the extreme wave compared with the deterministic wave the approach could provide a satisfactory profile for investigating the extreme response the background random wave η bg is obtained by superposing the multiple monochromatic waves namely 2 η bg t i 1 n 2 s ω i d ω cos ω i t ε i where ω i is the wave frequency of the individual wave component the random phase ε i of each individual wave component is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π eq 2 can alternatively be rewritten according to tucker et al 1984 as 3 η bg t n 1 n 2 a n cos ω i t b n sin ω i t where a n and b n are fourier components which are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance related to the wave energy spectrum 4 a n r n a n s ω n d ω b n r n b n s ω n d ω where rn an and rn bn are the standardized normally distributed random variables the constraint newwave elevation can be considered as follows 5 η t η bg t q e t r f t where e t and f t can be determined based on the following equations 6 e t

moment of the wave energy spectrum m 2 λ 2 σ 2 finally the constrained wave elevation can be derived according to the above equations as 7 η t η bg t r t α n 1 n 2 a n r t λ 2 α n 1 n 2 ω n b n where α 0 is the constrained slop for a crest r t is the slop of the unit newwave in the study the jonswap spectrum is employed 8 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where t p is the spectral dominant period t p t h1 3 1 0 132 γ 0 2 0 559 h 1 3 and t h1 3 are the significant wave height and period respectively f ω 2π is the wave frequency f p is the spectral peak frequency σ is the peak shape factor σ 0 07 f f p σ 0 09 f f p γ is the peak enhancement factor and normally a value of 3 3 can be used the parameter β j is determined by the following expression 9 β j 0 06238

of the fish cage is simulated in the numerical simulation via our in house code which has been validated against the experimental data dong et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 bi et al 2014 xu et al 2011 the hydrodynamic model with considerations of the interactions of each component was developed which was a time domain model and based on the lumped mass method in this section we briefly introduce the numerical method for modeling each part the geometry and parameters of the fish cage analyzed in this study are listed in table 1 the floating collars of the fish cage are mainly subjected to the wave forces gravity buoyancy net force and mooring line force according to newton s law the motion equations of the floating collars can be expressed as 13 m g a j i 1 n s u m f i j b i j g i j t m o o r i n g t n e t j 1 2 3 i x ω x t i z i y ω z ω y m x i y ω x t i x i z ω x ω z m y i z ω z t i y i x ω x ω y m z where subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent the global coordinate axes x y z respectively f is

the gravity m g is the mass of the body a i is the acceleration of the pipes rigid centroid m x m y and m z are the components of the moment vector m j along the principal axes i x i y and i z are the components of the moments of inertia along the three moving coordinate axes ω x ω y and ω z are the angles of rotation along the local coordinate axes respectively the forces on the floating pipes are obtained by summing up the forces acting on ith segment in the simulation the floating pipes are divided into n sum 400 segments each segment can be treated as a small straight cylinder fig 4 illustrates the mini segment of the floating collar because of the small sectional diameter of the floating pipes relative to the wavelength the drag forces on such a slender structure have a considerable effect morison equations are employed to calculate the wave forces the wave forces on each segment along three local coordinate axes are calculated based on the relative velocity and the relative acceleration between the segment and the water particle the wave forces of component n can be expressed as 14 f n 1 2 c d n ρ a n u n u n u n u n ρ v 0 a n c m n ρ v 0 a n u n where u n and u n are the velocity vectors of water particles and the mini segment respectively a n and u n are the acceleration vectors of water particles and the mini segment respectively ρ the water density v 0 is the displacement volume of the mini segment a n is the projected area similar formulas can be derived for calculating the wave forces of components w and u c dn c mn represent the drag coefficient and the added mass coefficient of component n respectively the nonlinear time varying buoyancy of the floating collar is evaluated at each time step based on the instantaneous submerged depth according to the segment geometry and the wave surface as shown fig 4 the buoyancy b j can be derived 15 b i ρ g r 2 ϕ i sin ϕ i d l 2 cos ϕ i 2 1 r z i η cos γ r where dl is the length of the mini segment η is the wave elevation at the central coordinates of the mini segment x i y i z i r is the radius of the pipe γ is the inclination angle ϕ i is the central angle against the projected chord length the net tensions and the mooring line forces acting on floating collars are obtained by the lumped mass hydrodynamic models of fish nets and mooring lines the lumped mass method was employed to model the nets and the mooring lines the net and mooring lines are simulated by a series of lumped mass points connected with massless springs as shown in fig 5 the mass point at the mesh knot and mesh twine are assumed to be spheres and cylinders the wave forces can be derived based on the relative velocity of the element and the water particle along three moving coordinate axes the drag force of point i can be obtained 16 f τ 1 2 ρ c d τ d net l v τ u τ v τ u τ ρ a τ c m τ ρ δ a τ d u t d t where c dτ c mτ represent the drag coefficient and the added mass coefficient of component τ respectively d net is the element diameter l is the element length v τ and u τ are the velocity of the lumped mass point and water particle respectively a τ and du τ dt are the accelerations of water particles and the mini segment of component τ respectively δ is the volume of the net element the component of the wave forces along the axes ζ ξ can be obtained in a similar way according to choo and casarella 1971 for the mesh twine the drag coefficient is calculated based on the reynolds number as follows 17 c ξ 8 π re n s 1 0 87 s 2 0 re n 1 1 45 8 55 re n 0 90 1 re n 30 1 1 4 re n 0 50 30 re n 10 5 c τ π μ 0 55 re n 1 2 0 084 re n 2 3 re n v r n d v s 0 07721565 ln 8 re n where μ is the viscosity of water c ζ and c τ are the normal and tangential drag coefficients for mesh bar v rn is the normal component of the fluid velocity relative to the bar and ρ is the density of water for the knot part the fredheim and faltinsen 2003 suggested it could be reasonable to use a drag coefficient in the range of 1 0 2 0 when modeling the knot part as a sphere here c d is set as 1 0 for the knot part the tensions on each point were based on the elongation of the nets the tension is given by the wilson 1967 as follows 18 t d 2 c 1 ε c 2 ε l l 0 l 0 where l 0 is the undeformed length l is the deformed length d is the diameter of mesh bar c 1 and c 2 are constants that define the elasticity of the element c 1 and c 2 can be got by matching referring to gerhard 1983 for pe material c 1 345 37 106 and c 2 1 0121 the units of t and d are n and m the motion equations of the point i can be written as 19 m a k 1 n t k f w b where m are the mass of lumped mass point i respectively c m is the added mass coefficient a is the acceleration of mass point t k is the tension from the adjacent points f w b are the wave forces the buoyancy force and the gravity force respectively based on the lumped mass method the deformations and the tension of the nets and mooring lines can be determined in the numerical simulation the cage column is divided into a series of triangular prisms as shown in fig 6 each prism is composed of three tetrahedrons based on the coordinates of the four points of the tetrahedrons the volume of each tetrahedron can be calculated by the mixed product of three vectors for example the volume of the tetrahedron p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 can be calculated by volume p 1 p 4 p 1 p 3 p 1 p 2 then the volume of the cage is obtained by summing up the volumes of the tetrahedrons the motion equations 13 and 19 are solved at each time step by the fifth runge kutta algorithm the floating collar the shape and deformation of the nets and the mooring forces can 2 2 2 verification of the numerical model the time domain numerical model has been examined by the corresponding experiments a series of regular wave and random wave tests were carried out at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology here we briefly show the comparisons between the experimental results and the numerical results the experiments were conducted in a wave flume which was 69 m length 2 m width 1 8 m depth the model scale was 1 20 the diameter of the floater model was 0 8 m and the radius of the cross section was 0 0125 m the fish cage motions in five regular wave cases were compared i e h 0 2 m t 6 26s h 5 m t 7 15s h 5 m t 8 04s h 6 m t 8 04s h 7 m t 8 94s which are donated as case 1 5 in the following comparisons the cage was four point moored in the flume as shown in fig 7 the anchored points were symmetrical with coordinates 3 2 m 0 97 m 3 2 m 0 97 m 3 2 m 0 97 m and 3 2 m 0 97 m the diameter of the floater model was 0 8 m and the radius of the cross section was 0 0125 m the bottom collar was made of the steel and was 62 5 g because it is difficult to use the same scale of 1 20 to model the net twine diameter an equivalent net model was knitted as the forces on nets is associated with the projected area of the nets the equivalent net was built so that the projected area fulfilled the similarity the depth of the net was 0 4 m the mesh size and the twine diameter of the model net were 20 5 mm and 1 0 mm respectively the gravity and elasticity similarity of the nets also fulfilled by adjusting the weight and separating the nets into several pieces three trackers were installed on the floating collar to trace the motions of the floating collar the transducers were used to measure the mooring force the trackers were also attached to the bottom ring and the nets to record the bottom ring s motions and the deformations of the nets the numerical results compared with the experimental data are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the maximum motion difference between the numerical and experimental results is less than 6 the maximum mooring force difference between the numerical and experimental results is less than 15 indicating good agreements were achieved the numerical results were further validated by the finite element program aqua fe developed at the university of new hampshire usa which can be referred to zhao et al 2015 those comparisons show the validation of the numerical model more validations of the numerical model can be referred to previous papers dong et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 bi et al 2014 xu et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic response of the fish cage in extreme waves fig 10 displays the motion histories of the floater in the extreme waves hs 5 m tp 10 s α 2hs 10 m the crest location of the extreme wave is at the center of the floaters x0 0 m and the focal time t0 is 650 s it can be seen from the figure that the floater heave motion is in phase of the wave elevation both before and after the extreme crests for the surge motions the cage bears a large increase in surge motions at the extreme crest and sustains large positive horizontal displacement after the subsequent wave crest passed the center of the cage the large surge motions would lead to large mooring forces and great volume loss of the fish cage which is discussed in the followings fig 11 shows the trajectory of the floating pipes under extreme waves the red dot donates the event of the extreme waves it can be observed that before the focused wave arrives the fish cage moves elliptically around the equilibrium position once the focused wave attacks the fish cage the fish cage extremely deviates the equilibrium position both vertically and horizontally the largest vertical displacement occurs at the extreme crest while the largest horizontal displacement exhibits after the extreme crest this result reminds us that the surge motion after the extreme crest should be paid much attention quantitatively the extreme wave with the crest height that is twice the significant wave height gives rise to more than twice displacement for example the maximum horizontal displacement of 12 1 m is even more than four times larger than the maximum horizontal displacement caused by the previous random waves the results demonstrate that the surge and heave motions reach the peak values at different instants and increase in a different degree the effective volume is of great importance because it is related to fish welfare the volume coefficient is defined as the ratio of the residual volume to the initial volume the volume coefficient of the fish cage in extreme waves is plotted in fig 12 it is observed that the volume coefficient sharply decreases to 0 7 more than 30 volume loss are not benefited to the fish which may starve the fish of oxygen and kill off fish in some cases the extreme waves also induce the large mooring forces fig 13 displays the mooring force histories it can be found that the windward mooring force dramatically increases when the extreme wave attacks to the fish cage while the leeward mooring line is loose which may be caused by the large surge motions the largest mooring forces occur after the extreme crest which is due to the phase shift of the extreme surge motions the peak mooring force is about 48 kn which is even three times larger than the random wave results the results demonstrate that the focused wave greatly increases the motions and mooring loads and reduce the effective volume of the fish cage which should be considered in the design of the fish cage 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 effect of the wave crest location and height when applying the focused wave to explore the extreme response of the fish cage the focal location of the extreme wave should be specified different locations of the extreme crest may result in different extreme responses especially for the floating dynamic sensitive structure to investigate the effect of the focal location on the cage response the extreme waves with different locations from 2 r to 2 r are simulated figs 14 and 15 illustrate the heave surge and mooring forces with different extreme crest locations the abscissa donates the normalized distance by the ratio of the distance δx between the extreme crest and the center of the cage to the floater radius r the heave motions heave crest z are normalized by the largest wave crest height the surge motions are normalized in the same way it can be seen that the crests of the heave and surge motions vary with the wave crest locations when the extreme crest attacks the fish cage at the range of r r the normalized heave motions vary in the interval 0 62 0 83 and the normalized surge motions vary in the range of 1 05 1 22 it is not surprising that the largest values of the motions and forces generally increase when the extreme crest is approaching the center of the fish cage and decrease as the extreme crest is away from the center however it is found that the largest extreme responses do not occur exactly at the location of the cage center the wave crest at the 0 25 r seems to give rise to the largest surge motions and the largest mooring forces the largest surge motions occur at the location 0 25 r 0 the results indicate that the exact extreme cage response estimations should consider the effect of the crest locations it should be noted that the exact crest location that results in the largest motions is also related to the geometry of the fish cage to get much more exact extreme cage responses under the focused waves the wave crest distance to the cage should be carefully examined to study the behavior of the focused waves with different steepness the motion and loads are evaluated for the increasing crest height α 1 6hs 1 8hs 2 0hs 2 2hs and 2 4hs as shown in fig 16 the wave peak period of tp 10 s is considered for all cases the peak surge and heave displacement are normalized by hs and are plotted with respect to the steepness the ratio of the crest height α to the wavelength l 151m as shown in figs 17 and 18 it is found that the peak heave motions have less variation with the increasing steepness the peak surge motion and mooring force show a dramatic increasing trend in the case of the volume coefficient it drops sharply with the increasing steepness 3 2 2 effect of the load histories the cage s load history as generated by previous waves may affect the response at the extreme waves getting insight into the effect of the background random waves on the cage response the same newwave profile is embedded into different random waves fig 19 illustrates the input focused wave groups with the same focal time and locations but with different background waves as examined before the crest location is set to 0 25 r fig 20 plots the corresponding heave and surge motions subjected to the different focused waves roughly it can be seen that the heave motions are always largely synchronized with the wave elevation the largest heave motion varies from 5 6 m to 7 6 m for different background random waves whose difference is about 20 of the wave crest height the results indicate that the load histories have significant effects on the extreme heave motions of the cages the surge difference caused by the load histories is much more pronounced varying from 5 4 m to 12 8 m moreover the mooring load and the volume coefficient under different focused waves are illustrated in figs 21 and 22 the maximum mooring force varies from 27 kn to 44 kn and the minimum volume coefficient varies from 0 59 to 0 73 the results suggest that one cannot apply the independent newwave without the consideration of the load histories to investigate the extreme motions and loads of the cages the influence of the previous waves should be considered when analyzing the interaction between the extreme wave and the floating fish cage 4 conclusions this study addresses the motion and load characteristics of the fish cage in the extreme focused waves the focused waves are generated at the specified location and the focal time by linear dispersion based on the newwave theory the fish cage is numerically simulated based on the lumped mass method the motions of the fish cage the mooring loads and the volume of the fish cage subjected to the focused waves are studied the results indicated the large wave crest greatly increases the surge and heave motions it is found that the surge and heave motions of the net cage under the attack of the focused waves reach the peak values at different instants and increase in a different degree the effective volume of the fish cage reduced to more than 30 which is not beneficial for the farmed fish the windward mooring line forces dramatically enlarge while the leeward mooring lines are slack the results remind us that the extreme response of the fish cage in the extreme wave should be paid much attention to explore the effect of the wave crest location and the effect of the wave steepness numerical investigations of the fish cage in different focal positions and wave steepness are carried out results indicate that different focal positions of the largest crest give rise to different peak values of the motions and mooring forces the surge motions are greatly sensitive to the crest location for the analyzed fish cage the crest location of 0 25 r in the windward side seems to lead to the largest motions and mooring loads honesty the exact focal position that results in the largest extreme responses varied for different diameters and geometries of the fish cage the results remind the designer that the extreme response of the fish cage in the extreme waves should be carefully examined at different extreme wave focal positions numerical results indicate that the peak heave motions have less variation for the different steepness the peak surge motions and mooring forces show a dramatic increasing trend with the increase of the steepness the impact of the load history meaning that the effect of the preceding waves before the focused waves is also analyzed different from the independent focused wave the constrained newwave is obtained by embedding different background random waves into the newwave profile comparisons of the fish cage in different focused waves indicate that the load histories greatly influence the peak values of the cage response the variation before the focused wave crest will result in a significant difference in the response at the largest crest ideally the short term or long term largest response of the structures can be predicted by employing the limited number of the constrained newwave which is expected to be a time efficient way for investigating the offshore structures extreme response however the numerical results suggest that the great sensitivity of the fish cage extreme response to the load history makes the approach inconclusive although the approach has been applied to the fixed structures such as the jackets the results imply that not only the crest location but also the preceding waves should be carefully examined when applying the focused waves for investigating the extreme response of the floating fish cage although the extreme response of the fish cage in focused waves is numerically analyzed in this paper the experimental investigation of the fish cage in extreme waves are still required the study also emphasized the need for an efficient method to predict the extreme response of the fish cage in extreme waves future work will extend the results obtained by taking into the nonlinear extreme waves which could

introduction the safety and survivability of the offshore aquacultural fish cage in extreme environmental conditions are of great importance the extreme waves correspond to the severe waves with respect to the significant wave height which are represented as rogue freak waves according to the definition of kharif et al 2009 the freak wave refers to the wave with the maximum wave crest height twice larger than the significant wave height the freak waves have been reported in both the ocean and coastal zones nikolkina and didenkuluva 2011 chien et al 2012 the unpredictable giant waves appear in sudden and occur in both moderate and severe sea states clauss et al 2003 the risks posed by extreme waves have recently been highlighted by a series of structural incidents with some resulting in fatalities kharif et al 2009 rudman and cleary 2013 the loss and damage caused by extreme waves prove the importance of the freak wave in the design phase of offshore structures for the elastic fish cage that is made of the composite material with less strength than the steel made offshore structures the potential extreme wave during their lifetime would lead to the structural failure and the biomass loss the assessment of the performance of offshore structures under extreme waves represents the important contribution to the structural design it is therefore of interest to investigate the response characteristics of the fish cage in extreme waves theoretical numerical and experimental methods have been done to throw light on the generation of the extreme waves as a simplified and efficient approach which is derived based on the first order stokes expansion the quasi determinism theory proposed by boccotti 1981 has been widely used in coastal and ocean engineering tromans et al 1991 further reformulated the formula and developed the newwave theory the approach efficiently generates the extreme wave at the predefined time instant and the focal location in a relatively short time series to simulate the randomness of the sea state and consider the wave profile around the focal space and time taylor et al 1997 further embedded a random background sea state in the newwave to obtain the constrained newwave cnw based on the newwave theory the deterministic functions calculating the surface elevation and the velocity potential in the space time domain can be explicitly derived the quasi determinism and newwave theory have been verified by some experiment and field measurements boccotti 2011 taylor et al 1997 ning et al 2009 bennett et al 2012 goteman et al 2015 hann et al 2018 as for the interaction between the quasi determinism wave with the structures numerous studies have been carried out cassidy et al 2001 and mirzadeh et al 2016 adopted the newwave to investigate the fixed jacket and proved its efficiency for predicting the short term extreme values gao et al 2020 employed the newwave to numerically analyze the transient gap resonance between two fixed boxes feng et al 2020 experimentally simulated the newwave and analyzed high harmonic wave loads and moments on a vertical cylinder rameeza et al 2020 used the newwave to estimate the impact load on the fixed offshore platform deck from the literature survey provided earlier it is noted that by this method the focused wave can be sufficiently and successfully considered in this study the newwave theory is adopted to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the fish cage system regarding to the dynamic response of the fish cages enormous

measurement the model tests and the numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the dynamic response of the fish cages in waves and currents although the previous studies have improved significantly our understanding of the response of fish cage few studies are related to the response of the fish cage in extreme wave conditions in this study the dynamic response of the fish cage under extreme waves is numerically investigated using the developed time domain numerical model of the fish cage the motions volume and the mooring loads of the cage system in extreme waves are analyzed the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the modeling of the extreme waves and briefly introduces the numerical model of the fish cage section 3 presents the hydrodynamic response of the fish cage in the extreme waves and analyzes the sensitivity of the response to extreme wave crest locations and wave steepness in the last section conclusions and future works are summarized 2 methodology 2 1 wave modeling the extreme wave is generated based on the newwave theory in this study it is a quasi deterministic method with the consideration of the spectral composition of the seas theoretically the newwave theory assumes the gaussian random process of the wave surface elevation and derives the extreme event at the predefined time instant and focal position based on tromans et al 1991 the wave elevation η nw at the location x of the newwave can be expressed as 1 η nw x x 0 t t 0 α r x t α σ 2 i 1 n s ω i d ω cos k i x x 0 ω i t t 0 where α is the crest elevation of the newwave r x t is the unit newwave k i represents the wavenumber and ω i represents the angular frequency of the ith frequency component σ is the standard deviation corresponding to the wave spectrum s ω i represents the spectrum x x 0 and t t 0 represent the distance and time relative to the focal time and position x 0 is the location of the highest crest and t 0 is the focal time of the newwave crest by the user defined time and position relative to the fish cage the fish cage attacked by the newwave crest at different times and positions can be simulated to incorporate a newwave within a background irregular wave taylor et al 1997 and cassidy et al 2001 mathematically derived the cnw the cnw profile is coincided with the newwave profile at the focal time instant t t0 and gradually tending to the random wave statistically the resulting cnw profile is indistinguishable from the original random series although the constrained method slightly alters the shape of the extreme wave compared with the deterministic wave the approach could provide a satisfactory profile for investigating the extreme response the background random wave η bg is obtained by superposing the multiple monochromatic waves namely 2 η bg t i 1 n 2 s ω i d ω cos ω i t ε i where ω i is the wave frequency of the individual wave component the random phase ε i of each individual wave component is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π eq 2 can alternatively be rewritten according to tucker et al 1984 as 3 η bg t n 1 n 2 a n cos ω i t b n sin ω i t where a n and b n are fourier components which are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance related to the wave energy spectrum 4 a n r n a n s ω n d ω b n r n b n s ω n d ω where rn an and rn bn are the standardized normally distributed random variables the constraint newwave elevation can be considered as follows 5 η t η bg t q e t r f t where e t and f t can be determined based on the following equations 6 e t

moment of the wave energy spectrum m 2 λ 2 σ 2 finally the constrained wave elevation can be derived according to the above equations as 7 η t η bg t r t α n 1 n 2 a n r t λ 2 α n 1 n 2 ω n b n where α 0 is the constrained slop for a crest r t is the slop of the unit newwave in the study the jonswap spectrum is employed 8 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where t p

σ is the peak shape factor σ 0 07 f f p σ 0 09 f f p γ is the peak enhancement factor and normally a value of 3 3 can be used the parameter β j is determined by the following expression 9 β j 0 06238

of the fish cage is simulated in the numerical simulation via our in house code which has been validated against the experimental data dong et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 bi et al 2014 xu et al 2011 the hydrodynamic model with considerations of the interactions of each component was developed which was a time domain model and based on the lumped mass method in this section we briefly introduce the numerical method for modeling each part the geometry and parameters of the fish cage analyzed in this study are listed in table 1 the floating collars of the fish cage are mainly subjected to the wave forces gravity buoyancy net force and mooring line force according to newton s law the motion equations of the floating collars can be expressed as 13 m g a j i 1 n s u m f i j b i j g i j t m o o r i n g t n e t j 1 2 3 i x ω x t i z i y ω z ω y m x i y ω x t i x i z ω x ω z m y i z ω z t i y i x ω x ω y m z where subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent the global coordinate axes x y z respectively f is

the gravity m g is the mass of the body a i is the acceleration of the pipes rigid centroid m x m y and m z are the components of the moment vector m j along the principal axes i x i y and i z are the components of the moments of inertia along the three moving coordinate axes ω x ω y and ω z are the angles of rotation along the local coordinate axes respectively the forces on the floating pipes are obtained by summing up the forces acting on ith segment in the simulation the floating pipes are divided into n sum 400 segments each segment can be treated as a small straight cylinder fig 4 illustrates the mini segment of the floating collar because of the small sectional diameter of the floating pipes relative to the wavelength the drag forces on such a slender structure have a considerable effect morison equations are employed to calculate the wave forces the wave forces on each segment along three local coordinate axes are calculated based on the relative velocity and the relative acceleration between the segment and the water particle the wave forces of component n can be expressed as 14 f n 1 2 c d n ρ a n u n u n u n u n ρ v 0 a n c m n ρ v 0 a n u n where u n and u n are the velocity vectors of water particles and the mini segment respectively a n and u n are the acceleration vectors of water particles and the mini segment respectively ρ the water density v 0 is the displacement volume of the mini segment a n is the projected area similar formulas can be derived for calculating the wave forces of components w and u c dn c mn represent the drag coefficient and the added mass coefficient of component n respectively the nonlinear time varying buoyancy of the floating collar is evaluated at each time step based on the instantaneous submerged depth according to the segment geometry and the wave surface as shown fig 4 the buoyancy b j can be derived 15 b i ρ g r 2 ϕ i sin ϕ i d l 2 cos ϕ i 2 1 r z i η cos γ r where dl is the length of the mini segment η is the wave elevation at the central coordinates of the mini segment x i y i z i r is the radius of the pipe γ is the inclination angle ϕ i is the central angle against the projected chord length the net tensions and the mooring line forces acting on floating collars are obtained by the lumped mass hydrodynamic models of fish nets and mooring lines the lumped mass method was employed to model the nets and the mooring lines the net and mooring lines are simulated by a series of lumped mass points connected with massless springs as shown in fig 5 the mass point at the mesh knot and mesh twine are assumed to be spheres and cylinders the wave forces can be derived based on the relative velocity of the element and the water particle along three moving coordinate axes the drag force of point i can be obtained 16 f τ 1 2 ρ c d τ d net l v τ u τ v τ u τ ρ a τ c m τ ρ δ a τ d u t d t where c dτ c mτ represent the drag coefficient and the added mass coefficient of component τ respectively d net is the element diameter l is the element length v τ and u τ are the velocity of the lumped mass point and water particle respectively a τ and du τ dt are the accelerations of water particles and the mini segment of component τ respectively δ is the volume of the net element the component of the wave forces along the axes ζ ξ can be obtained in a similar way according to choo and casarella 1971 for the mesh twine the drag coefficient is calculated based on the reynolds number as follows 17 c ξ 8 π re n s 1 0 87 s 2 0 re n 1 1 45 8 55 re n 0 90 1 re n 30 1 1 4 re n 0 50 30 re n 10 5 c τ π μ 0 55 re n 1 2 0 084 re n 2 3 re n v r n d v s 0 07721565 ln 8 re n where μ is the viscosity of water c ζ and c τ are the normal and tangential drag coefficients for mesh bar v rn is the normal component of the fluid velocity relative to the bar and ρ is the density of water for the knot part the fredheim and faltinsen 2003 suggested it could be reasonable to use a drag coefficient in the range of 1 0 2 0 when modeling the knot part as a sphere here c d is set as 1 0 for the knot part the tensions on each point were based on the elongation of the nets the tension is given by the wilson 1967 as follows 18 t d 2 c 1 ε c 2 ε l l 0 l 0 where l 0 is the undeformed length l is the deformed length d is the diameter of mesh bar c 1 and c 2 are constants that define the elasticity of the element c 1 and c 2 can be got by matching referring to gerhard 1983 for pe material c 1 345 37 106 and c 2 1 0121 the units of t and d are n and m the motion equations of the point i can be written as 19 m a k 1 n t k f w b where m are the mass of lumped mass point i respectively c m is the added mass coefficient a is the acceleration of mass point t k is the tension from the adjacent points f w b are the wave forces the buoyancy force and the gravity force respectively based on the lumped mass method the deformations and the tension of the nets and mooring lines can be determined in the numerical simulation the cage column is divided into a series of triangular prisms as shown in fig 6 each prism is composed of three tetrahedrons based on the coordinates of the four points of the tetrahedrons the volume of each tetrahedron can be calculated by the mixed product of three vectors for example the volume of the tetrahedron p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 can be calculated by volume p 1 p 4 p 1 p 3 p 1 p 2 then the volume of the cage is obtained by summing up the volumes of the tetrahedrons the motion equations 13 and 19 are solved at each time step by the fifth runge kutta algorithm the floating collar the shape and deformation of the nets and the mooring forces can 2 2 2 verification of the numerical model the time domain numerical model has been examined by the corresponding experiments a series of regular wave and random wave tests were carried out at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology here we briefly show the comparisons between the experimental results and the numerical results the experiments were conducted in a wave flume which was 69 m length 2 m width 1 8 m depth the model scale was 1 20 the diameter of the floater model was 0 8 m and the radius of the cross section was 0 0125 m the fish cage motions in five regular wave cases were compared i e h 0 2 m t 6 26s h 5 m t 7 15s h 5 m t 8 04s h 6 m t 8 04s h 7 m t 8 94s which are donated as case 1 5 in the following comparisons the cage was four point moored in the flume as shown in fig 7 the anchored points were symmetrical with coordinates 3 2 m 0 97 m 3 2 m 0 97 m 3 2 m 0 97 m and 3 2 m 0 97 m the diameter of the floater model was 0 8 m and the radius of the cross section was 0 0125 m the bottom collar was made of the steel and was 62 5 g because it is difficult to use the same scale of 1 20 to model the net twine diameter an equivalent net model was knitted as the forces on nets is associated with the projected area of the nets the equivalent net was built so that the projected area fulfilled the similarity the depth of the net was 0 4 m the mesh size and the twine diameter of the model net were 20 5 mm and 1 0 mm respectively the gravity and elasticity similarity of the nets also fulfilled by adjusting the weight and separating the nets into several pieces three trackers were installed on the floating collar to trace the motions of the floating collar the transducers were used to measure the mooring force the trackers were also attached to the bottom ring and the nets to record the bottom ring s motions and the deformations of the nets the numerical results compared with the experimental data are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the maximum motion difference between the numerical and experimental results is less than 6 the maximum mooring force difference between the numerical and experimental results is less than 15 indicating good agreements were achieved the numerical results were further validated by the finite element program aqua fe developed at the university of new hampshire usa which can be referred to zhao et al 2015 those comparisons show the validation of the numerical model more validations of the numerical model can be referred to previous papers dong et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 bi et al 2014 xu et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic response of the fish cage in extreme waves fig 10 displays the motion histories of the floater in the extreme waves hs 5 m tp 10 s α 2hs 10 m the crest location of the extreme wave is at the center of the floaters x0 0 m and the focal time t0 is 650 s it can be seen from the figure that the floater heave motion is in phase of the wave elevation both before and after the extreme crests for the surge motions the cage bears a large increase in surge motions at the extreme crest and sustains large positive horizontal displacement after the subsequent wave crest passed the center of the cage the large surge motions would lead to large mooring forces and great volume loss of the fish cage which is discussed in the followings fig 11 shows the trajectory of the floating pipes under extreme waves the red dot donates the event of the extreme waves it can be observed that before the focused wave arrives the fish cage moves elliptically around the equilibrium position once the focused wave attacks the fish cage the fish cage extremely deviates the equilibrium position both vertically and horizontally the largest vertical displacement occurs at the extreme crest while the largest horizontal displacement exhibits after the extreme crest this result reminds us that the surge motion after the extreme crest should be paid much attention quantitatively the extreme wave with the crest height that is twice the significant wave height gives rise to more than twice displacement for example the maximum horizontal displacement of 12 1 m is even more than four times larger than the maximum horizontal displacement caused by the previous random waves the results demonstrate that the surge and heave motions reach the peak values at different instants and increase in a different degree the effective volume is of great importance because it is related to fish welfare the volume coefficient is defined as the ratio of the residual volume to the initial volume the volume coefficient of the fish cage in extreme waves is plotted in fig 12 it is observed that the volume coefficient sharply decreases to 0 7 more than 30 volume loss are not benefited to the fish which may starve the fish of oxygen and kill off fish in some cases the extreme waves also induce the large mooring forces fig 13 displays the mooring force histories it can be found that the windward mooring force dramatically increases when the extreme wave attacks to the fish cage while the leeward mooring line is loose which may be caused by the large surge motions the largest mooring forces occur after the extreme crest which is due to the phase shift of the extreme surge motions the peak mooring force is about 48 kn which is even three times larger than the random wave results the results demonstrate that the focused wave greatly increases the motions and mooring loads and reduce the effective volume of the fish cage which should be considered in the design of the fish cage 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 effect of the wave crest location and height when applying the focused wave to explore the extreme response of the fish cage the focal location of the extreme wave should be specified different locations of the extreme crest may result in different extreme responses especially for the floating dynamic sensitive structure to investigate the effect of the focal location on the cage response the extreme waves with different locations from 2 r to 2 r are simulated figs 14 and 15 illustrate the heave surge and mooring forces with different extreme crest locations the abscissa donates the normalized distance by the ratio of the distance δx between the extreme crest and the center of the cage to the floater radius r the heave motions heave crest z are normalized by the largest wave crest height the surge motions are normalized in the same way it can be seen that the crests of the heave and surge motions vary with the wave crest locations when the extreme crest attacks the fish cage at the range of r r the normalized heave motions vary in the interval 0 62 0 83 and the normalized surge motions vary in the range of 1 05 1 22 it is not surprising that the largest values of the motions and forces generally increase when the extreme crest is approaching the center of the fish cage and decrease as the extreme crest is away from the center however it is found that the largest extreme responses do not occur exactly at the location of the cage center the wave crest at the 0 25 r seems to give rise to the largest surge motions and the largest mooring forces the largest surge motions occur at the location 0 25 r 0 the results indicate that the exact extreme cage response estimations should consider the effect of the crest locations it should be noted that the exact crest location that results in the largest motions is also related to the geometry of the fish cage to get much more exact extreme cage responses under the focused waves the wave crest distance to the cage should be carefully examined to study the behavior of the focused waves with different steepness the motion and loads are evaluated for the increasing crest height α 1 6hs 1 8hs 2 0hs 2 2hs and 2 4hs as shown in fig 16 the wave peak period of tp 10 s is considered for all cases the peak surge and heave displacement are normalized by hs and are plotted with respect to the steepness the ratio of the crest height α to the wavelength l 151m as shown in figs 17 and 18 it is found that the peak heave motions have less variation with the increasing steepness the peak surge motion and mooring force show a dramatic increasing trend in the case of the volume coefficient it drops sharply with the increasing steepness 3 2 2 effect of the load histories the cage s load history as generated by previous waves may affect the response at the extreme waves getting insight into the effect of the background random waves on the cage response the same newwave profile is embedded into different random waves fig 19 illustrates the input focused wave groups with the same focal time and locations but with different background waves as examined before the crest location is set to 0 25 r fig 20 plots the corresponding heave and surge motions subjected to the different focused waves roughly it can be seen that the heave motions are always largely synchronized with the wave elevation the largest heave motion varies from 5 6 m to 7 6 m for different background random waves whose difference is about 20 of the wave crest height the results indicate that the load histories have significant effects on the extreme heave motions of the cages the surge difference caused by the load histories is much more pronounced varying from 5 4 m to 12 8 m moreover the mooring load and the volume coefficient under different focused waves are illustrated in figs 21 and 22 the maximum mooring force varies from 27 kn to 44 kn and the minimum volume coefficient varies from 0 59 to 0 73 the results suggest that one cannot apply the independent newwave without the consideration of the load histories to investigate the extreme motions and loads of the cages the influence of the previous waves should be considered when analyzing the interaction between the extreme wave and the floating fish cage 4 conclusions this study addresses the motion and load characteristics of the fish cage in the extreme focused waves the focused waves are generated at the specified location and the focal time by linear dispersion based on the newwave theory the fish cage is numerically simulated based on the lumped mass method the motions of the fish cage the mooring loads and the volume of the fish cage subjected to the focused waves are studied the results indicated the large wave crest greatly increases the surge and heave motions it is found that the surge and heave motions of the net cage under the attack of the focused waves reach the peak values at different instants and increase in a different degree the effective volume of the fish cage reduced to more than 30 which is not beneficial for the farmed fish the windward mooring line forces dramatically enlarge while the leeward mooring lines are slack the results remind us that the extreme response of the fish cage in the extreme wave should be paid much attention to explore the effect of the wave crest location and the effect of the wave steepness numerical investigations of the fish cage in different focal positions and wave steepness are carried out results indicate that different focal positions of the largest crest give rise to different peak values of the motions and mooring forces the surge motions are greatly sensitive to the crest location for the analyzed fish cage the crest location of 0 25 r in the windward side seems to lead to the largest motions and mooring loads honesty the exact focal position that results in the largest extreme responses varied for different diameters and geometries of the fish cage the results remind the designer that the extreme response of the fish cage in the extreme waves should be carefully examined at different extreme wave focal positions numerical results indicate that the peak heave motions have less variation for the different steepness the peak surge motions and mooring forces show a dramatic increasing trend with the increase of the steepness the impact of the load history meaning that the effect of the preceding waves before the focused waves is also analyzed different from the independent focused wave the constrained newwave is obtained by embedding different background random waves into the newwave profile comparisons of the fish cage in different focused waves indicate that the load histories greatly influence the peak values of the cage response the variation before the focused wave crest will result in a significant difference in the response at the largest crest ideally the short term or long term largest response of the structures can be predicted by employing the limited number of the constrained newwave which is expected to be a time efficient way for investigating the offshore structures extreme response however the numerical results suggest that the great sensitivity of the fish cage extreme response to the load history makes the approach inconclusive although the approach has been applied to the fixed structures such as the jackets the results imply that not only the crest location but also the preceding waves should be carefully examined when applying the focused waves for investigating the extreme response of the floating fish cage although the extreme response of the fish cage in focused waves is numerically analyzed in this paper the experimental investigation of the fish cage in extreme waves are still required the study also emphasized the need for an efficient method to predict the extreme response of the fish cage in extreme waves future work will extend the results obtained by taking into the nonlinear extreme waves which could

20743,the driven monopile is the most common foundation type for all installed offshore wind turbines these monopiles are often subject to scour phenomena which cause a reduction in foundation strength and stiffness in order to prevent the consequences of this phenomenon scour protection systems are used to protect the seabed around a monopile structure against scour in practice this paper presents a numerical model to investigate the effect of scour protection on the natural frequency and lateral responses of monopile supported offshore wind turbines under the ultimate limit state uls serviceability limit state sls and fatigue limit state fls this numerical model was validated through a series of model tests and then applied to the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine supported on an offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 monopile with riprap rock scour protection system the study concludes that the scour protection has a slight impact on the first natural frequency and monopile behavior under uls and fls however the scour protection significantly decreases the pile head rotation at mudline under sls which provides the opportunity for further optimization of monopile design by incorporating the contribution of scour protection thereby leading to a more economical design keywords offshore wind turbine monopile scour protection displacement natural frequency 1 introduction with the consumption of fossil fuels the global focus on utilizing renewable energy sources is constantly increasing taveira pinto et al 2020 in the past several years the offshore wind turbine industry has expanded enormously in order to meet the demand as of the end of 2019 the total cumulative offshore wind capacity has exceeded 29 gw gwec 2020 for installed offshore wind turbines more than 80 of the substructures are monopiles gupta and basu 2020 when a monopile foundation is placed on an erodible seabed it is prone to local scour due to the action of waves and currents mayall 2019 this phenomenon seriously affects the overall stability and dynamic behavior of monopile foundations s ø rensen and ibsen 2013 prendergast et al 2015 chortis et al 2020 in order to prevent the consequences of this phenomenon scour protection systems are used to protect the seabed around a monopile structure against scour in practice de vos et al 2011 matutano et al 2013 today there are a variety of different scour protection systems such as dumped stone riprap filled bags or nets or grouted fabric mattress matutano et al 2013 mayall 2019 the most common scour protection is usually carried out through a filter layer and an armor layer rock classes rip rap and is typically installed in front of a side dumping vessel or by fall pipe the degree of which depends on the dimension of the monopile and the soil properties matutano et al 2013 the design and sizing of these scour protection systems has been studied by different authors den boon et al 2004 de vos et al 2011 de vos et al 2012 matutano et al 2013 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 a recent research fazeres ferradosa et al 2020 indicated that the scour protections design must be improved also due to the consequences it may have on the structure soil interaction just like scour scour protection can influence the natural frequencies of the structure and lateral capacity of the foundation s æ vdal 2017 chortis 2018 mayall 2019 but few studies have been conducted to investigate these effects on structural integrity of the design sævdal 2017 studied the effect of scour protection on the natural frequency of monopiles in sand through a 3d fem analysis in plaxis the hardening soil small hss model has been used for the sand the simulations considered a benchmark case without scour protection that is a case with only surface load and a case with a full scour protection layer he found that in the case of a load step of 100 kn the natural frequency under surface load increased by 1 while in the case of a full scour protection layer its natural frequency increased by 10 however due to lack of field data his numerical model has not been verified nor has it been compared with the measured values chortis 2018 performed a numerical investigation of the effect of scour protection on the lateral capacity of a monopile in sand by monotonic lateral loading using the same finite element program that was used in the sævdal 2017 study the ultimate lateral capacity of a monopile is specified in a pile displacement of 0 1d on the soil surface three analyses were carried out using different diameter of scour protection layer namely 3 0d 5 0d and 7 0d his research shows that scour protection has a positive influence on lateral capacity and increases nearly by 5 15 with the diameter of protection layer increasing from 3 0d to 7 0d mayall 2019 studied the effect of scour and scour protection on the stiffness and strength of the monopile foundation through one dimensional finite element modeling and flume tank experiments sour phenomena and a realistic shape of the depth and the hole at the foundation were taken into consideration in his structural analysis structural dynamics testing and analysis were used to study stiffness effects and monotonic lateral loading testing and analysis were used to study strength effects three types of scour protection systems were investigated namely pre installed rock armor remedial rock fill and remedial tyre filled nets his research concluded that scour protection can enhance the stiffness and strength of monopile foundations under lateral loading conditions with greater enhancement in strength than stiffness the magnitude of these enhancements depends on the strength of the type of scour protection system the rock type scour protection system has a significant effect while the type filled nets have much less effect however these enhancements become diminished if global scour causes the scour protection to become unstable typically the natural frequency fatigue and pile lateral displacement under sls are the main design drivers for offshore wind turbine support structures rezaei et al 2018 ma and yang 2020 previous studies s æ vdal 2017 chortis 2018 mayall 2019 have revealed that the natural frequency increases with the installation of scour protection devices especially when using the riprap rock scour protection system but there is still a lack of adequate model tests or field measurement data verification the effect of scour protection on pile displacement at mudline under sls and the fatigue damage of offshore wind turbines supported by monopiles jackets tripods gbfs etc have few published reports in practice the influence of scour protection on monopile behavior is intuitively expected to has a positive effect on natural frequency and lateral capacity mayall 2019 therefore it is often ignored as a conservative design and has received little research attention there is almost no guidance on the effects of scour protection on monopile foundation performance dnvgl 2016 in order to optimize the design method that incorporates the contribution of scour protection and to establish design guidance it is very necessary to study the effect of the scour protection on the behavior of monopiles this paper presents a three dimensional finite element model to investigate the effects of scour protection on natural frequency lateral deformation of piles pile stress and fatigue damage of a wind turbine supported by a monopile installed in sand a 1 g scale experiment of an offshore wind turbine with monopile foundation was conducted two different cases have been investigated namely a benchmark case without scour protection and a riprap rock scour protection system the results of these tests are used to calibrate the 3d finite element modeling in the latter part of this paper numerical modeling is used to investigate the influence of scour protection on natural frequency pile deflection under sls pile stress under uls and fatigue damage using realistic structural properties corresponding to a 5 mw full scale offshore wind turbine 2 methodology the aim of this paper is to evaluate the influence of scour protection measures on the lateral capacity stiffness and fatigue damage of a typical offshore monopile this study was performed using a numerical method the numerical model used in conjunction with the scour protection model soil parameters and loading conditions are described below 2 1 reference model nrel 5 mw turbine supported on oc3 monopile in this paper a 5 mw wind turbine supported on oc3 monopile is used as a reference model with properties provided by the us national renewable energy laboratory nrel jonkman et al 2009 this wind turbine has been used as a reference by research teams around the world to quantify the benefits of advanced offshore wind energy technologies gentils et al 2017 morató et al 2017 its main characteristics are described in table 1 the nrel 5 mw was installed on a monopile with a rigid foundation in 20 m of water and designed during the offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 project for the international energy agency iea the properties of the different soil layers are summarized in table 2 the tower has a length of 77 6 m a base diameter of 6 m and a top diameter of 3 87 m and is connected to a monopile with a constant diameter of 6 m and a constant thickness of 0 06 m the tower base begins at an elevation of 10 m above mean sea level msl the monopile extends from 36 m below the mudline to 10 m above the sea surface giving it a total length of 66 m the transition piece was not considered in detail the detailed geometry of the pile tower and soil profile is depicted in fig 1 a the tower is bolted together with the monopile through the internal flange bolt the material properties of the monopile and tower are based on s355 steel 2 2 scour protection system according to design standards e g dnvgl 2016 it is stated that scour should be considered in pile design but provides limited guidance on how to do so chavez et al 2019 this paper adopts a protection system based on rock riprap because it is frequently used due to its low cost and easy availability compared to other solutions such as geotextile bags or prefabricated concrete blocks the minimum extension of the scour protection system l e x t was estimated according to the following equation matutano et al 2013 1 l e x t d 2 s m a x cot ϕ where d is the dimater of the monopole s m a x is the maximum scour depth chosen as 1 3 d dnvgl 2016 and ϕ 33 is the internal friction angle of the top soil layer of the seabed the benchmark value of the scour protection system extension l e x t is approximately 2 5 d the characteristic size and properties of the scour protection layer were selected to represent a real situation based on the conditions described by kallehave 2015 the scour protection layer consists of two layers or rocks filter and armor layers the filter and armor layers were assumed to be 0 8 m and 1 2 m thick respectively as shown in fig 1 b the scour protection layer was modeled with the mohr coulomb constitutive model having an elastic perfectly plastic behavior despite some shortcomings the mohr coulomb criterion has been widely used in numerical studies owing to its simplicity and acceptable performance e g achmus et al 2009 jung et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the study by sævdal 2017 also used the mohr coulomb criterion for the scour protection layer according to sævdal 2017 the internal friction angle is set to 38 the cohesion c increases to 20 kpa to simulate the higher strength of the scour protection materials comparted to the layer beneath and the parameters were shown in table 2 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 general in this study the finite element program abaqus was employed to establish an integrated numerical modeling for offshore wind turbine support structures as shown in fig 2 the fe model comprises the rotor nacelle assembly rna tower monopile scour protection soil around the pile and the soil plug inside the pile the pile was assumed to be fully plugged due to compaction of the sand during pile driving paik et al 2003 rna was modeled as a lumped mass located at the top of the tower to which the mass of the rotor nacelle and blades contributed greatly the size of the soil domain in the fem was 210 105 54 m and the 42 m thick layer of the infinite element created vertical boundaries that do not reflect shear waves in the soil medium the lower boundary was fixed against movements in all directions it can be verified that these model dimensions are adequate in ensuring that there are no artificial boundary effects on the behavior of soil pile systems the scour protection soil around the pile and plug mesh were constructed using the continuum element type c3d8r and the outer layer of the soil was modeled using a single layer of solid infinite element cin3d8 the tower and steel piles were modeled using shell elements s4r due to the symmetry of the problem only half of the tower monopile foundation scour protection and surrounding soil were considered in the model the symmetrical vertical plane i e the loading plane was fixed against translation in its normal direction the details of the fem mesh are shown in fig 2 a benchmark case without any scour protection was simulated the results of which were used to analyze the effect of scour protection on the performance of the monopile 2 3 2 material model and properties the pile and the tower were assumed to be made of steel material having the typical properties and the linear elastic behavior was assumed with a young s modulus e s 210 gpa and a poisson s ratio ν 0 3 the higher density steel 8500 kg m3 was used for the tower section to account for the added mass of the secondary structures soil materials were idealized using the mohr coulomb constitutive model with an elastic perfectly plastic behavior the elastic plastic behavior is characterized by young s modulus poisson s ratio cohesion angle of internal friction and dilation angle which are given in table 2 2 3 3 interaction properties the pile soil pile scour protection layers and soil scour protection layer were modeled as small sliding surface to surface master slave contact pair formulation in abaqus standard hard contact and isotropic coulomb friction models were incorporated for normal and tangential directions respectively both the normal and tangential contact constraints were enforced using the penalty method the friction coefficient μ for the interface was taken as μ tan 2 3 ϕ where ϕ is the friction angle of the soil or scour protection layer 2 3 4 loading conditions the foundation of an offshore wind turbine is usually designed based on the met ocean conditions and several load combinations need to be studied the nrel 5 mw supported on monopile is used as a reference model which is located in the dutch sector of the north sea 8 km away from the shore of ijmuiden city and refers to the nl 1 location in ref gentils et al 2017 this paper uses three sets of load combinations to evaluate the effect of scour protection in the monopile foundation one corresponds to the serviceability limit state sls considering the rotor in operation mode including a rated wind speed of 11 4 m s under a combined effect of wave loads whose return period is 50 years with a load factor of 1 0 for all load categories the second corresponds to the ultimate limit state uls and under characteristic load effects similar to sls the load factors are equal to 1 0 and 1 35 for permanent and environmental loads respectively dnvgl 2016 the third corresponds to the fatigue limit state fls in this paper the fatigue design load is predicted based on the dlc 1 2 load case dnvgl 2016 iec 2009 which is very commonly used in fatigue limit state design gentils et al 2017 in this load case the current load is not considered according to the dnvgl 2016 standard the load safety factor for fatigue is equal to 1 0 table 3 summaries the load cases considered in this study assuming that the wind load and the wave load are in the same direction the resulting wave load and wind load were applied at mean sea level and at the top of the tower respectively in general dynamic loads such as wind and wave loads have a significant impact on the lateral stiffness and strength of the soil as well as its scour protection capacity despite the efforts of various researchers to investigate the influence of cyclic loading on the lateral stiffness of the soil there is still no well accepted method to qualify it and use it in practical designs abadie et al 2019 barari et al 2017 dnvgl 2016 leblanc et al 2010 therefore this paper considers the loading condition as static and does not investigate the dynamic response 2 4 verification of the finite element model 2 4 1 expermiental equipment in order to validate the finite element modeling a 1 g laboratory floor expeiment was conducted on a stiff monopile in laboratory sand a typical 5 mw jonkman et al 2009 cuéllar 2011 offshore wind turbine with a monopile support structure in 30 m water depth was considered as a reference to design the scaled model the monopile has an outer diameter of 7 5 m and embedded depth of 30 m the hub height is 110 m above mean sea level model tests were carried out at a scale of 1 100 under 1 g conditions with a scaling design based on buckingham s π theorem leblanc et al 2010 abadie et al 2019 bisoi and halder 2019 considering the minimum mass accelerometer available in the laboratory and the minimum thickness of the steel pile in the market the mass of the turbine and the thickness of the pile are greater than that calculated according to the scaling law however since the purpose of the model tests is to validate the numerical model these approximations are acceptable the main parameters of the experimental model were listed in table 4 the test set up is sketched in fig 3 the test programme was designed to investigate the effect of scour protection on the first natural frequency and the response of the monopile all experiments were carried out in a sand tank of 1 2 m long 0 9 m wide and 0 8 m deep a 0 7 m dry sand deposit was prepared in 7 layers and each layer was compacted to the desired density the experiments were conducted using a quartz sand mix fujian sand wang et al 2015 under dry conditions whose granulometric distribution was similar to that of berliner sand used in ref cuéllar 2011 as presented in fig 4 in the tests the sand density was set at 1 65 g cm3 corresponding to a dense state the main properties of sand were tested according to gb t50123 1999 and are summarized in table 5 the model pile is made of 304 stainless steel with an outer diameter of 75 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 1 mm which is assumed to behave as a rigid body poulos 1982 the total length of the open ended steel pile is 1 7 m the embedded length to diameter l d ratio of 4 was taken into consideration during the installation process the pile was fixed vertically and driven to the target embedment manually by means of a hydraulic jack two displacement sensors yhd 100 were used to register the pile deflection with an accuracy of 0 01 mm which were placed 35 mm and 280 mm above the soil surface respectively the pile rotation was also calculated for the free vibration tests a horizontal impact load generates an initial velocity with a wood hammer and the response of the pile is registered by an accelerometer dh610h placed on top of the pile a lumped mass 840 g including the mass of the accelerometer was placed on top of the pile to simulate the mass of the offshore wind turbine s superstructure for monotonic static loading tests the loading frame consists of a horizontal steel beam connected to two strong steel columns fixed at the base a pulley was attached to the bottom of the beam and steel wire running over the pulley was used to apply the horizontal load as shown in fig 3 the lateral load was stepped applied to the pile by placing the case iron weights over the load hanger which was attached to the free end of the steel wire the lateral load is applied at a height of 300 mm above the soil surface 2 4 2 scour protection model in this experiment the riprap rock scour protection system is employed the grading curve of the rock scour protection was selected from those available by geometric similarity to that installed in selected full size structures at horns rev wind farm matutano et al 2016 the stone diameter d50 in the filter layer is 0 2 m and the thickness is 0 5 m the d50 of the armor layer is 0 4 m and the thickness is 1 m the total thickness of the protection layer is 1 5 m assuming a scale of 1 100 an angular narrow graded limestone gravel of median diameter d 50 20 40 mm for the filter layer and the armor layer respectively and the total thickness is 15 mm the density of the rock is similar to that of normal density rock used offshore the extension of the scour protection l e x t is estimated by equation 1 the arranged protection size is shown in fig 5 and its properties are listed in table 6 the properties of the dense sand and the scour protection layer used for numerical analysis such as the reference young s modulus were tested according to gb t50123 1999 the oedometric stiffness parameter and young s modulus of the dense sand were estimated according to the method of achmus et al 2019 poisson s ratio dilation angle and cohesion are assumed according to previous relative studies achmus et al 2019 mayall 2019 sævdal 2017 in order to explore the influence of scour protection on monopile foundation a benchmark case without any scour protection was also established 2 4 3 test programme the test programme was designed to investigate the effect of scour protection on the first natural frequency and lateral response of the monopile the testing initially involved free vibration tests then followed by monotonic static loading tests free acceleration measurements were made with no lateral loads applied to the structure the lateral load was applied in small increments of 5 n each incremental load maintains a constant value until the pile displacement stabilizes when the horizontal displacement at mudline reaches 0 1 d leblanc et al 2010 abadie et al 2019 the loading ends the chosen test programme is summarized in table 7 2 4 4 numerical model for the tests using the same modeling method described in section 2 3 numerical models for the model tests with and without scour protection were constructed respectively as shown in fig 6 the soil has been divided into 7 layers with a height of 10 cm so as to be able to vary the oedometric stiffness with depth and young s elastic modulus was calculated according to equation 2 achmus et al 2019 2 e s o i l e s o i l r e f σ 3 p r e f λ where e s o i l is the young s modulus of the soil e s o i l r e f is the reference young s modulus value of the soil used in the experiment achmus et al 2019 p r e f 100 mpa is the reference stress value λ 0 55 is the material constant parameter σ 3 is the minimum principal stress which was approximately calculated by the vertical stress and poisson s ratio of the soil layer table 6 shows the material parameters for dense sand and scour protection used in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison between simulation and test results table 8 shows a comparison between simulation and test for the first natural frequency it can be easily seen that the first natural frequency compares very consistent with the test value table 8 also displays the change in the first natural frequency in the cases of without scour protection and with scour protection here the first natural frequency for the case without scour protection is used as the benchmark case where the first natural frequency is 14 6 hz from the test results the scour protection provides an increase in the first natural frequency of about 2 0 compared to the benchmark case the horizontal load displacement relation at mudline was evaluated for the test and compared with the nonlinear fem analysis as shown in fig 7 it was observed that the scour protection had a positive influence on the lateral soil capacity in this paper an ultimate capacity defined by a horizontal displacement of the pile at mudline equal to 0 1d is used leblanc et al 2010 as can be seen the scour protection carries an increase of about 10 5 in the ultimate capacity compared to the case without scour protection from the test results the comparison with the simulation results shows that it is in close agreement with the test results and the disparity of the ultimate capacity between the two cases appears within 4 0 in conclusion it can be stated that the numerical model is capable of representing the load bearing behavior of monopiles in sand under a monotonic horizontal loading and calculating the natural frequency with reasonable accuracy 3 2 the first natural frequency numerical simulations were performed to determine the natural frequency of the first fore aft mode for the scour protection and no scour protection cases respectively the first natural frequency can be extracted in a linear perturbation analysis step which are available in abaqus standard the first natural frequencies of scour protection and no scour protection cases are 0 239 hz and 0 233 hz respectively it indicates that scour protection gives an increase in the first natural frequency of about 2 6 wherein this value is similar to the results of previous studies mayall 2019 compared to a range between 0 212 hz 1 p and 0 328 hz 3 p for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine the structure is safely within the soft stiff range this implies that the increase in the first natural frequency caused by the scour protection can be ignored during the design phase 3 3 pile stress distribution under the uls the von mises stress distribution of the pile is shown in fig 8 as can be seen the maximum von mises stresses are becoming slightly smaller with a decrease of about 5 4 for the scour protection case the maximum von mises stresses of the pile are located below the mudline at nearly 3 m and 4 m for scour protection and no scour protection cases respectively these are due to the higher overburden pressure caused by the scour protection layer which increases the confining pressure of the soil around the pile and hence increases its strength thereby further reducing the deflection of the pile compared to the 355 mpa steel strength used for the monopile the maximum stress reduction by 5 4 based on 192 8 mpa without scour protection case can be ignored in the design phase under uls 3 4 pile deformation under the sls for design in the serviceability limit state sls the deformation tolerance is usually given on the design basis and is often specified in terms of maximum allowable rotations of the pile head mudline in a vertical plane dnvgl 2016 the allowable rotations of the pile head mudline refer to the accumulated permanent rotation resulting from cyclic and dynamic loadings throughout the design lifetime of the offshore wind turbine the deformation tolerance is typically derived from visual requirements and requirements for the operation of the wind turbine and have been clarified with the wind turbine manufacturer richards et al 2020 who usually controls the design ma and yang 2020 however there are no methods available to calculate the accumulated rotation in design codes therefore in this study the rotation of the pile head at mudline under a monotonic sls load condition was used to investigate the effect of scour protection on the behavior of the monopile because it is positively correlated with accumulated rotation leblanc et al 2010 fig 9 shows lateral deflection along the pile for scour protection and no scour protection cases under the sls compared to the benchmark case without scour protection the lateral deflection and rotation of the pile head mudline were reduced from 65 1 to 53 2 mm about 18 3 and from 0 291 to 0 255 about 12 3 respectively indicating that the scour protection measures can significantly reduce the horizontal deformation of the monopile at the mudline 3 5 fls design monopile foundations are vulnerable to fatigue damage and are subject to the intensive environmental loading from wind and waves for the design of monopiles the fatigue limit state is mainly decisive the american bureau of shipping 2020 suggests four methods such as the simplified method the deterministic method the spectral method and the time domain method for fatigue analysis since the purpose of this study is to illustrate the effect of scour protection in the fls design a simplified method used by previous researchers was adopted without considering the dynamic amplification of stresses due to resonance in this paper the design number of cycles is assumed to be 107 over a 20 year lifetime requirement the design fatigue stress range σ n 10 7 can be derived using an equivalent s n curve proposed by dnvgl 2016 3 l o g n l o g a m log δ σ t t r e f k where n is the predicted number of cycles to failure in the stress range δ σ l o g a is the intercept between the log n axis m is the negative inverse slope of the s n curve δ σ is stress range in units of mpa scf is the stress concentration factor t r e f is the reference thickness of 25 mm t is the thickness through which the potential fatigue crack will grow and k is the thickness exponent of 0 2 for n 10 6 cycles the values of l o g a and m are 15 606 and 5 0 respectively fig 10 shows the maximum cross sectional von mises stress σ m relative to the design fatigue stress σ n 10 7 it can be seen that σ m σ n 10 7 is slightly affected by scour protection in the case of scour protection the σ m σ n 10 7 is 4 7 lower than that of the no scour protection cases from 0 to 5 m below the mudline 4 sensitivity analysis using the finite element model described above a sensitivity analysis was further conducted to investigate the effect of the relative importance of design parameters including elastic modulus e s p effective unit weight γ s p scour protection extension l e x t and thickness t s p on the cross section rotation θ s l s under sls the maximum von mises stress σ u l s under uls and the σ m σ n 10 7 under fls of monopile at mudline the effect on the first natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine structure f 1 was also investigated in this study the effects of these parameters were analyzed independently 4 1 effect of elastic modulus of scour protection considering the greater uncertainty caused by the construction method and the properties of scour protection a range of e s p from 43 5 to 174 mpa was selected keeping the other parameters unchanged fe calculations were carried out for this range of e s p and the results are summarized in table 9 generally f 1 θ s l s σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 vary slightly with e s p an increase in e s p from 43 5 to 174 mpa results in an increase in f 1 from 0 237 to 0 2407 hz about 1 6 increase on the contrary an increase in e s p causes a 0 7 decrease in θ s l s increasing e s p has no obvious effect on σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 4 2 effect of effective unit weight γ s p on f 1 σ uls θ sls and σ m σ n 10 7 the in situ installation of effective unit weight γ s p of scour protection would be affected by the construction method scour protection material properties and the accreted sand in the scour protection void space to study its influence the γ s p was assumed to vary from 6 to 16 kn m3 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 esteban et al 2019 without changes in the rest of the parameters as shown in table 10 σ u l s θ s l s and σ m σ n 10 7 decrease with increasing γ s p while f 1 increases with increasing γ s p specifically when γ s p increases from 6 to 16 kn m3 σ u l s θ s l s and σ m σ n 10 7 decrease by 2 0 4 5 and 1 2 respectively and f 1 increases by 0 3 this obviously shows that increasing γ s p of scour protection can be effective in relatively reducing the rotation at the mudline of the monopile which is caused by a stiffening of the subsoil due to the extra vertical stress 4 3 effect of scour protection extension l ext and thickness t sp on f 1 σ uls θ sls and σ m σ n 10 7 the extension l e x t and thickness t s p of the scour protection are the critical design parameters for the riprap rock scour protection system which are usually designed using empirical methodologies de vos et al 2011 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 the typical size of the extension and thickness for scour protection of the various existing offshore wind farms range from 2d to 4 5d and 0 7 2 8 m respectively matutano et al 2013 esteban et al 2019 therefore in order to study the effect of l e x t and t s p on the behavior of a monopile the ranges of 2d to 5d and 1 m 3 m are selected for l e x t and t s p in this study the results are depicted in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively its ordinate represents the ratio of f 1 σ u l s θ s l s and σ m σ n 10 7 to their respective benchmark values without the scout protection case as shown in fig 11 l e x t has a slight influence on f 1 σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 as l e x t increases from 2d to 5d f 1 f 1 b m increases from 1 023 to 1 028 while σ u l s σ u l s b m and σ m σ n 10 7 σ m σ n 10 7 b m decreased from 0 959 to 0 951 and 0 938 to 0 922 respectively compared to the effect of l e x t on the behavior of a monopile t s p has a relatively obvious influence on f 1 σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 as t s p increases from 1 to 3 m f 1 f 1 b m increases from 1 015 to 1 033 while σ u l s σ u l s b m σ m σ n 10 7 σ m σ n 10 7 b m decreased from 0 973 to 0 930 0 944 to 0 921 and 0 927 to 0 826 respectively on the contrary both l e x t and t s p have a significant influence on θ s l s since l e x t and t s p increase from 2d to 5d and 1 3 m θ s l s θ s l s b m decreases from 0 9 to 0 81 and 0 93 to 0 83 respectively these are attributed to the higher overburden pressures due to the scour protection layer that increase the confining stresses of the soil around the pile especially in the upper soil layers and reduce a few meters of cantilever length of the support structure of offshore wind turbine by scour protection 5 conclusions in this paper the effect of scour protection on monopile behavior including the first natural frequency the maximum pile stress under uls the rotation at mudline of the pile under sls and the fatigue stress under fls were investigated by numerical methods the numerical model was constructed on the platform of abaqus and validated by model tests the nrel 5 mw wind turbine supported by a monopile foundation at 20 m water depth was used as a reference model and a parametric study was carried out to examine the influence of several design factors the findings of this paper are summarized as follows 1 the first natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine with scour protection is higher than that of the case without scour protection which can mostly be ignored in the design of offshore wind turbine structure 2 the scour protection has a small positive influence on the monopile behavior under both ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state 3 the scour protection can noticeably reduce the cross sectional rotation of the pile at mudline under the serviceability limit state considering that rotation is a common design driver for monopile foundations it is necessary that further optimization of monopile design incorporates the contribution of scour protection 4 based on the sensitivity analysis the density of the rock and the thickness of the scour protection have a relatively significant positive effect on the first natural frequency and monopile behavior under uls sls and fls although the results of the study are focused on applications to monopile foundations with a static scour protection the research method can be extended to other foundations such as jackets tripods and gravity based foundations moreover the monopile behavior should be investigated with a dynamic scour protection and load conditions should be considered as dynamic in the future credit authorship contribution statement hongwang ma methodology finite element model and analysis data curation model

20743,the driven monopile is the most common foundation type for all installed offshore wind turbines these monopiles are often subject to scour phenomena which cause a reduction in foundation strength and stiffness in order to prevent the consequences of this phenomenon scour protection systems are used to protect the seabed around a monopile structure against scour in practice this paper presents a numerical model to investigate the effect of scour protection on the natural frequency and lateral responses of monopile supported offshore wind turbines under the ultimate limit state uls serviceability limit state sls and fatigue limit state fls this numerical model was validated through a series of model tests and then applied to the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine supported on an offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 monopile with riprap rock scour protection system the study concludes that the scour protection has a slight impact on the first natural frequency and monopile behavior under uls and fls however the scour protection significantly decreases the pile head rotation at mudline under sls which provides the opportunity for further optimization of monopile design by incorporating the contribution of scour protection thereby leading to a more economical design keywords offshore wind turbine monopile scour protection displacement natural frequency 1 introduction with the consumption of fossil fuels the global focus on utilizing renewable energy sources is constantly increasing taveira pinto et al 2020 in the past several years the offshore wind turbine industry has expanded enormously in order to meet the demand as of the end of 2019 the total cumulative offshore wind capacity has exceeded 29 gw gwec 2020 for installed offshore wind turbines more than 80 of the substructures are monopiles gupta and basu 2020 when a monopile foundation is placed on an erodible seabed it is prone to local scour due to the action of waves and currents mayall 2019 this phenomenon seriously affects the overall stability and dynamic behavior of monopile foundations s ø rensen and ibsen 2013 prendergast et al 2015 chortis et al 2020 in order to prevent the consequences of this phenomenon scour protection systems are used to protect the seabed around a monopile structure against scour in practice de vos et al 2011 matutano et al 2013 today there are a variety of different scour protection systems such as dumped stone riprap filled bags or nets or grouted fabric mattress matutano et al 2013 mayall 2019 the most common scour protection is usually carried out through a filter layer and an armor layer rock classes rip rap and is typically installed in front of a side dumping vessel or by fall pipe the degree of which depends on the dimension of the monopile and the soil properties matutano et al 2013 the design and sizing of these scour protection systems has been studied by different authors den boon et al 2004 de vos et al 2011 de vos et al 2012 matutano et al 2013 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 a recent research fazeres ferradosa et al 2020 indicated that the scour protections design must be improved also due to the consequences it may have on the structure soil interaction just like scour scour protection can influence the natural frequencies of the structure and lateral capacity of the foundation s æ vdal 2017 chortis 2018 mayall 2019 but few studies have been conducted to investigate these effects on structural integrity of the design sævdal 2017 studied the effect of scour protection on the natural frequency of monopiles in sand through a 3d fem analysis in plaxis the hardening soil small hss model has been used for the sand the simulations considered a benchmark case without scour protection that is a case with only surface load and a case with a full scour protection layer he found that in the case of a load step of 100 kn the natural frequency under surface load increased by 1 while in the case of a full scour protection layer its natural frequency increased by 10 however due to lack of field data his numerical model has not been verified nor has it been compared with the measured values chortis 2018 performed a numerical investigation of the effect of scour protection on the lateral capacity of a monopile in sand by monotonic lateral loading using the same finite element program that was used in the sævdal 2017 study the ultimate lateral capacity of a monopile is specified in a pile displacement of 0 1d on the soil surface three analyses were carried out using different diameter of scour protection layer namely 3 0d 5 0d and 7 0d his research shows that scour protection has a positive influence on lateral capacity and increases nearly by 5 15 with the diameter of protection layer increasing from 3 0d to 7 0d mayall 2019 studied the effect of scour and scour protection on the stiffness and strength of the monopile foundation through one dimensional finite element modeling and flume tank experiments sour phenomena and a realistic shape of the depth and the hole at the foundation were taken into consideration in his structural analysis structural dynamics testing and analysis were used to study stiffness effects and monotonic lateral loading testing and analysis were used to study strength effects three types of scour protection systems were investigated namely pre installed rock armor remedial rock fill and remedial tyre filled nets his research concluded that scour protection can enhance the stiffness and strength of monopile foundations under lateral loading conditions with greater enhancement in strength than stiffness the magnitude of these enhancements depends on the strength of the type of scour protection system the rock type scour protection system has a significant effect while the type filled nets have much less effect however these enhancements become diminished if global scour causes the scour protection to become unstable typically the natural frequency fatigue and pile lateral displacement under sls are the main design drivers for offshore wind turbine support structures rezaei et al 2018 ma and yang 2020 previous studies s æ vdal 2017 chortis 2018 mayall 2019 have revealed that the natural frequency increases with the installation of scour protection devices especially when using the riprap rock scour protection system but there is still a lack of adequate model tests or field measurement data verification the effect of scour protection on pile displacement at mudline under sls and the fatigue damage of offshore wind turbines supported by monopiles jackets tripods gbfs etc have few published reports in practice the influence of scour protection on monopile behavior is intuitively expected to has a positive effect on natural frequency and lateral capacity mayall 2019 therefore it is often ignored as a conservative design and has received little research attention there is almost no guidance on the effects of scour protection on monopile foundation performance dnvgl 2016 in order to optimize the design method that incorporates the contribution of scour protection and to establish design guidance it is very necessary to study the effect of the scour protection on the behavior of monopiles this paper presents a three dimensional finite element model to investigate the effects of scour protection on natural frequency lateral deformation of piles pile stress and fatigue damage of a wind turbine supported by a monopile installed in sand a 1 g scale experiment of an offshore wind turbine with monopile foundation was conducted two different cases have been investigated namely a benchmark case without scour protection and a riprap rock scour protection system the results of these tests are used to calibrate the 3d finite element modeling in the latter part of this paper numerical modeling is used to investigate the influence of scour protection on natural frequency pile deflection under sls pile stress under uls and fatigue damage using realistic structural properties corresponding to a 5 mw full scale offshore wind turbine 2 methodology the aim of this paper is to evaluate the influence of scour protection measures on the lateral capacity stiffness and fatigue damage of a typical offshore monopile this study was performed using a numerical method the numerical model used in conjunction with the scour protection model soil parameters and loading conditions are described below 2 1 reference model nrel 5 mw turbine supported on oc3 monopile in this paper a 5 mw wind turbine supported on oc3 monopile is used as a reference model with properties provided by the us national renewable energy laboratory nrel jonkman et al 2009 this wind turbine has been used as a reference by research teams around the world to quantify the benefits of advanced offshore wind energy technologies gentils et al 2017 morató et al 2017 its main characteristics are described in table 1 the nrel 5 mw was installed on a monopile with a rigid foundation in 20 m of water and designed during the offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 project for the international energy agency iea the properties of the different soil layers are summarized in table 2 the tower has a length of 77 6 m a base diameter of 6 m and a top diameter of 3 87 m and is connected to a monopile with a constant diameter of 6 m and a constant thickness of 0 06 m the tower base begins at an elevation of 10 m above mean sea level msl the monopile extends from 36 m below the mudline to 10 m above the sea surface giving it a total length of 66 m the transition piece was not considered in detail the detailed geometry of the pile tower and soil profile is depicted in fig 1 a the tower is bolted together with the monopile through the internal flange bolt the material properties of the monopile and tower are based on s355 steel 2 2 scour protection system according to design standards e g dnvgl 2016 it is stated that scour should be considered in pile design but provides limited guidance on how to do so chavez et al 2019 this paper adopts a protection system based on rock riprap because it is frequently used due to its low cost and easy availability compared to other solutions such as geotextile bags or prefabricated concrete blocks the minimum extension of the scour protection system l e x t was estimated according to the following equation matutano et al 2013 1 l e x t d 2 s m a x cot ϕ where d is the dimater of the monopole s m a x is the maximum scour depth chosen as 1 3 d dnvgl 2016 and ϕ 33 is the internal friction angle of the top soil layer of the seabed the benchmark value of the scour protection system extension l e x t is approximately 2 5 d the characteristic size and properties of the scour protection layer were selected to represent a real situation based on the conditions described by kallehave 2015 the scour protection layer consists of two layers or rocks filter and armor layers the filter and armor layers were assumed to be 0 8 m and 1 2 m thick respectively as shown in fig 1 b the scour protection layer was modeled with the mohr coulomb constitutive model having an elastic perfectly plastic behavior despite some shortcomings the mohr coulomb criterion has been widely used in numerical studies owing to its simplicity and acceptable performance e g achmus et al 2009 jung et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the study by sævdal 2017 also used the mohr coulomb criterion for the scour protection layer according to sævdal 2017 the internal friction angle is set to 38 the cohesion c increases to 20 kpa to simulate the higher strength of the scour protection materials comparted to the layer beneath and the parameters were shown in table 2 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 general in this study the finite element program abaqus was employed to establish an integrated numerical modeling for offshore wind turbine support structures as shown in fig 2 the fe model comprises the rotor nacelle assembly rna tower monopile scour protection soil around the pile and the soil plug inside the pile the pile was assumed to be fully plugged due to compaction of the sand during pile driving paik et al 2003 rna was modeled as a lumped mass located at the top of the tower to which the mass of the rotor nacelle and blades contributed greatly the size of the soil domain in the fem was 210 105 54 m and the 42 m thick layer of the infinite element created vertical boundaries that do not reflect shear waves in the soil medium the lower boundary was fixed against movements in all directions it can be verified that these model dimensions are adequate in ensuring that there are no artificial boundary effects on the behavior of soil pile systems the scour protection soil around the pile and plug mesh were constructed using the continuum element type c3d8r and the outer layer of the soil was modeled using a single layer of solid infinite element cin3d8 the tower and steel piles were modeled using shell elements s4r due to the symmetry of the problem only half of the tower monopile foundation scour protection and surrounding soil were considered in the model the symmetrical vertical plane i e the loading plane was fixed against translation in its normal direction the details of the fem mesh are shown in fig 2 a benchmark case without any scour protection was simulated the results of which were used to analyze the effect of scour protection on the performance of the monopile 2 3 2 material model and properties the pile and the tower were assumed to be made of steel material having the typical properties and the linear elastic behavior was assumed with a young s modulus e s 210 gpa and a poisson s ratio ν 0 3 the higher density steel 8500 kg m3 was used for the tower section to account for the added mass of the secondary structures soil materials were idealized using the mohr coulomb constitutive model with an elastic perfectly plastic behavior the elastic plastic behavior is characterized by young s modulus poisson s ratio cohesion angle of internal friction and dilation angle which are given in table 2 2 3 3 interaction properties the pile soil pile scour protection layers and soil scour protection layer were modeled as small sliding surface to surface master slave contact pair formulation in abaqus standard hard contact and isotropic coulomb friction models were incorporated for normal and tangential directions respectively both the normal and tangential contact constraints were enforced using the penalty method the friction coefficient μ for the interface was taken as μ tan 2 3 ϕ where ϕ is the friction angle of the soil or scour protection layer 2 3 4 loading conditions the foundation of an offshore wind turbine is usually designed based on the met ocean conditions and several load combinations need to be studied the nrel 5 mw supported on monopile is used as a reference model which is located in the dutch sector of the north sea 8 km away from the shore of ijmuiden city and refers to the nl 1 location in ref gentils et al 2017 this paper uses three sets of load combinations to evaluate the effect of scour protection in the monopile foundation one corresponds to the serviceability limit state sls considering the rotor in operation mode including a rated wind speed of 11 4 m s under a combined effect of wave loads whose return period is 50 years with a load factor of 1 0 for all load categories the second corresponds to the ultimate limit state uls and under characteristic load effects similar to sls the load factors are equal to 1 0 and 1 35 for permanent and environmental loads respectively dnvgl 2016 the third corresponds to the fatigue limit state fls in this paper the fatigue design load is predicted based on the dlc 1 2 load case dnvgl 2016 iec 2009 which is very commonly used in fatigue limit state design gentils et al 2017 in this load case the current load is not considered according to the dnvgl 2016 standard the load safety factor for fatigue is equal to 1 0 table 3 summaries the load cases considered in this study assuming that the wind load and the wave load are in the same direction the resulting wave load and wind load were applied at mean sea level and at the top of the tower respectively in general dynamic loads such as wind and wave loads have a significant impact on the lateral stiffness and strength of the soil as well as its scour protection capacity despite the efforts of various researchers to investigate the influence of cyclic loading on the lateral stiffness of the soil there is still no well accepted method to qualify it and use it in practical designs abadie et al 2019 barari et al 2017 dnvgl 2016 leblanc et al 2010 therefore this paper considers the loading condition as static and does not investigate the dynamic response 2 4 verification of the finite element model 2 4 1 expermiental equipment in order to validate the finite element modeling a 1 g laboratory floor expeiment was conducted on a stiff monopile in laboratory sand a typical 5 mw jonkman et al 2009 cuéllar 2011 offshore wind turbine with a monopile support structure in 30 m water depth was considered as a reference to design the scaled model the monopile has an outer diameter of 7 5 m and embedded depth of 30 m the hub height is 110 m above mean sea level model tests were carried out at a scale of 1 100 under 1 g conditions with a scaling design based on buckingham s π theorem leblanc et al 2010 abadie et al 2019 bisoi and halder 2019 considering the minimum mass accelerometer available in the laboratory and the minimum thickness of the steel pile in the market the mass of the turbine and the thickness of the pile are greater than that calculated according to the scaling law however since the purpose of the model tests is to validate the numerical model these approximations are acceptable the main parameters of the experimental model were listed in table 4 the test set up is sketched in fig 3 the test programme was designed to investigate the effect of scour protection on the first natural frequency and the response of the monopile all experiments were carried out in a sand tank of 1 2 m long 0 9 m wide and 0 8 m deep a 0 7 m dry sand deposit was prepared in 7 layers and each layer was compacted to the desired density the experiments were conducted using a quartz sand mix fujian sand wang et al 2015 under dry conditions whose granulometric distribution was similar to that of berliner sand used in ref cuéllar 2011 as presented in fig 4 in the tests the sand density was set at 1 65 g cm3 corresponding to a dense state the main properties of sand were tested according to gb t50123 1999 and are summarized in table 5 the model pile is made of 304 stainless steel with an outer diameter of 75 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 1 mm which is assumed to behave as a rigid body poulos 1982 the total length of the open ended steel pile is 1 7 m the embedded length to diameter l d ratio of 4 was taken into consideration during the installation process the pile was fixed vertically and driven to the target embedment manually by means of a hydraulic jack two displacement sensors yhd 100 were used to register the pile deflection with an accuracy of 0 01 mm which were placed 35 mm and 280 mm above the soil surface respectively the pile rotation was also calculated for the free vibration tests a horizontal impact load generates an initial velocity with a wood hammer and the response of the pile is registered by an accelerometer dh610h placed on top of the pile a lumped mass 840 g including the mass of the accelerometer was placed on top of the pile to simulate the mass of the offshore wind turbine s superstructure for monotonic static loading tests the loading frame consists of a horizontal steel beam connected to two strong steel columns fixed at the base a pulley was attached to the bottom of the beam and steel wire running over the pulley was used to apply the horizontal load as shown in fig 3 the lateral load was stepped applied to the pile by placing the case iron weights over the load hanger which was attached to the free end of the steel wire the lateral load is applied at a height of 300 mm above the soil surface 2 4 2 scour protection model in this experiment the riprap rock scour protection system is employed the grading curve of the rock scour protection was selected from those available by geometric similarity to that installed in selected full size structures at horns rev wind farm matutano et al 2016 the stone diameter d50 in the filter layer is 0 2 m and the thickness is 0 5 m the d50 of the armor layer is 0 4 m and the thickness is 1 m the total thickness of the protection layer is 1 5 m assuming a scale of 1 100 an angular narrow graded limestone gravel of median diameter d 50 20 40 mm for the filter layer and the armor layer respectively and the total thickness is 15 mm the density of the rock is similar to that of normal density rock used offshore the extension of the scour protection l e x t is estimated by equation 1 the arranged protection size is shown in fig 5 and its properties are listed in table 6 the properties of the dense sand and the scour protection layer used for numerical analysis such as the reference young s modulus were tested according to gb t50123 1999 the oedometric stiffness parameter and young s modulus of the dense sand were estimated according to the method of achmus et al 2019 poisson s ratio dilation angle and cohesion are assumed according to previous relative studies achmus et al 2019 mayall 2019 sævdal 2017 in order to explore the influence of scour protection on monopile foundation a benchmark case without any scour protection was also established 2 4 3 test programme the test programme was designed to investigate the effect of scour protection on the first natural frequency and lateral response of the monopile the testing initially involved free vibration tests then followed by monotonic static loading tests free acceleration measurements were made with no lateral loads applied to the structure the lateral load was applied in small increments of 5 n each incremental load maintains a constant value until the pile displacement stabilizes when the horizontal displacement at mudline reaches 0 1 d leblanc et al 2010 abadie et al 2019 the loading ends the chosen test programme is summarized in table 7 2 4 4 numerical model for the tests using the same modeling method described in section 2 3 numerical models for the model tests with and without scour protection were constructed respectively as shown in fig 6 the soil has been divided into 7 layers with a height of 10 cm so as to be able to vary the oedometric stiffness with depth and young s elastic modulus was calculated according to equation 2 achmus et al 2019 2 e s o i l e s o i l r e f σ 3 p r e f λ where e s o i l is the young s modulus of the soil e s o i l r e f is the reference young s modulus value of the soil used in the experiment achmus et al 2019 p r e f 100 mpa is the reference stress value λ 0 55 is the material constant parameter σ 3 is the minimum principal stress which was approximately calculated by the vertical stress and poisson s ratio of the soil layer table 6 shows the material parameters for dense sand and scour protection used in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison between simulation and test results table 8 shows a comparison between simulation and test for the first natural frequency it can be easily seen that the first natural frequency compares very consistent with the test value table 8 also displays the change in the first natural frequency in the cases of without scour protection and with scour protection here the first natural frequency for the case without scour protection is used as the benchmark case where the first natural frequency is 14 6 hz from the test results the scour protection provides an increase in the first natural frequency of about 2 0 compared to the benchmark case the horizontal load displacement relation at mudline was evaluated for the test and compared with the nonlinear fem analysis as shown in fig 7 it was observed that the scour protection had a positive influence on the lateral soil capacity in this paper an ultimate capacity defined by a horizontal displacement of the pile at mudline equal to 0 1d is used leblanc et al 2010 as can be seen the scour protection carries an increase of about 10 5 in the ultimate capacity compared to the case without scour protection from the test results the comparison with the simulation results shows that it is in close agreement with the test results and the disparity of the ultimate capacity between the two cases appears within 4 0 in conclusion it can be stated that the numerical model is capable of representing the load bearing behavior of monopiles in sand under a monotonic horizontal loading and calculating the natural frequency with reasonable accuracy 3 2 the first natural frequency numerical simulations were performed to determine the natural frequency of the first fore aft mode for the scour protection and no scour protection cases respectively the first natural frequency can be extracted in a linear perturbation analysis step which are available in abaqus standard the first natural frequencies of scour protection and no scour protection cases are 0 239 hz and 0 233 hz respectively it indicates that scour protection gives an increase in the first natural frequency of about 2 6 wherein this value is similar to the results of previous studies mayall 2019 compared to a range between 0 212 hz 1 p and 0 328 hz 3 p for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine the structure is safely within the soft stiff range this implies that the increase in the first natural frequency caused by the scour protection can be ignored during the design phase 3 3 pile stress distribution under the uls the von mises stress distribution of the pile is shown in fig 8 as can be seen the maximum von mises stresses are becoming slightly smaller with a decrease of about 5 4 for the scour protection case the maximum von mises stresses of the pile are located below the mudline at nearly 3 m and 4 m for scour protection and no scour protection cases respectively these are due to the higher overburden pressure caused by the scour protection layer which increases the confining pressure of the soil around the pile and hence increases its strength thereby further reducing the deflection of the pile compared to the 355 mpa steel strength used for the monopile the maximum stress reduction by 5 4 based on 192 8 mpa without scour protection case can be ignored in the design phase under uls 3 4 pile deformation under the sls for design in the serviceability limit state sls the deformation tolerance is usually given on the design basis and is often specified in terms of maximum allowable rotations of the pile head mudline in a vertical plane dnvgl 2016 the allowable rotations of the pile head mudline refer to the accumulated permanent rotation resulting from cyclic and dynamic loadings throughout the design lifetime of the offshore wind turbine the deformation tolerance is typically derived from visual requirements and requirements for the operation of the wind turbine and have been clarified with the wind turbine manufacturer richards et al 2020 who usually controls the design ma and yang 2020 however there are no methods available to calculate the accumulated rotation in design codes therefore in this study the rotation of the pile head at mudline under a monotonic sls load condition was used to investigate the effect of scour protection on the behavior of the monopile because it is positively correlated with accumulated rotation leblanc et al 2010 fig 9 shows lateral deflection along the pile for scour protection and no scour protection cases under the sls compared to the benchmark case without scour protection the lateral deflection and rotation of the pile head mudline were reduced from 65 1 to 53 2 mm about 18 3 and from 0 291 to 0 255 about 12 3 respectively indicating that the scour protection measures can significantly reduce the horizontal deformation of the monopile at the mudline 3 5 fls design monopile foundations are vulnerable to fatigue damage and are subject to the intensive environmental loading from wind and waves for the design of monopiles the fatigue limit state is mainly decisive the american bureau of shipping 2020 suggests four methods such as the simplified method the deterministic method the spectral method and the time domain method for fatigue analysis since the purpose of this study is to illustrate the effect of scour protection in the fls design a simplified method used by previous researchers was adopted without considering the dynamic amplification of stresses due to resonance in this paper the design number of cycles is assumed to be 107 over a 20 year lifetime requirement the design fatigue stress range σ n 10 7 can be derived using an equivalent s n curve proposed by dnvgl 2016 3 l o g n l o g a m log δ σ t t r e f k where n is the predicted number of cycles to failure in the stress range δ σ l o g a is the intercept between the log n axis m is the negative inverse slope of the s n curve δ σ is stress range in units of mpa scf is the stress concentration factor t r e f is the reference thickness of 25 mm t is the thickness through which the potential fatigue crack will grow and k is the thickness exponent of 0 2 for n 10 6 cycles the values of l o g a and m are 15 606 and 5 0 respectively fig 10 shows the maximum cross sectional von mises stress σ m relative to the design fatigue stress σ n 10 7 it can be seen that σ m σ n 10 7 is slightly affected by scour protection in the case of scour protection the σ m σ n 10 7 is 4 7 lower than that of the no scour protection cases from 0 to 5 m below the mudline 4 sensitivity analysis using the finite element model described above a sensitivity analysis was further conducted to investigate the effect of the relative importance of design parameters including elastic modulus e s p effective unit weight γ s p scour protection extension l e x t and thickness t s p on the cross section rotation θ s l s under sls the maximum von mises stress σ u l s under uls and the σ m σ n 10 7 under fls of monopile at mudline the effect on the first natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine structure f 1 was also investigated in this study the effects of these parameters were analyzed independently 4 1 effect of elastic modulus of scour protection considering the greater uncertainty caused by the construction method and the properties of scour protection a range of e s p from 43 5 to 174 mpa was selected keeping the other parameters unchanged fe calculations were carried out for this range of e s p and the results are summarized in table 9 generally f 1 θ s l s σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 vary slightly with e s p an increase in e s p from 43 5 to 174 mpa results in an increase in f 1 from 0 237 to 0 2407 hz about 1 6 increase on the contrary an increase in e s p causes a 0 7 decrease in θ s l s increasing e s p has no obvious effect on σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 4 2 effect of effective unit weight γ s p on f 1 σ uls θ sls and σ m σ n 10 7 the in situ installation of effective unit weight γ s p of scour protection would be affected by the construction method scour protection material properties and the accreted sand in the scour protection void space to study its influence the γ s p was assumed to vary from 6 to 16 kn m3 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 esteban et al 2019 without changes in the rest of the parameters as shown in table 10 σ u l s θ s l s and σ m σ n 10 7 decrease with increasing γ s p while f 1 increases with increasing γ s p specifically when γ s p increases from 6 to 16 kn m3 σ u l s θ s l s and σ m σ n 10 7 decrease by 2 0 4 5 and 1 2 respectively and f 1 increases by 0 3 this obviously shows that increasing γ s p of scour protection can be effective in relatively reducing the rotation at the mudline of the monopile which is caused by a stiffening of the subsoil due to the extra vertical stress 4 3 effect of scour protection extension l ext and thickness t sp on f 1 σ uls θ sls and σ m σ n 10 7 the extension l e x t and thickness t s p of the scour protection are the critical design parameters for the riprap rock scour protection system which are usually designed using empirical methodologies de vos et al 2011 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 the typical size of the extension and thickness for scour protection of the various existing offshore wind farms range from 2d to 4 5d and 0 7 2 8 m respectively matutano et al 2013 esteban et al 2019 therefore in order to study the effect of l e x t and t s p on the behavior of a monopile the ranges of 2d to 5d and 1 m 3 m are selected for l e x t and t s p in this study the results are depicted in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively its ordinate represents the ratio of f 1 σ u l s θ s l s and σ m σ n 10 7 to their respective benchmark values without the scout protection case as shown in fig 11 l e x t has a slight influence on f 1 σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 as l e x t increases from 2d to 5d f 1 f 1 b m increases from 1 023 to 1 028 while σ u l s σ u l s b m and σ m σ n 10 7 σ m σ n 10 7 b m decreased from 0 959 to 0 951 and 0 938 to 0 922 respectively compared to the effect of l e x t on the behavior of a monopile t s p has a relatively obvious influence on f 1 σ u l s and σ m σ n 10 7 as t s p increases from 1 to 3 m f 1 f 1 b m increases from 1 015 to 1 033 while σ u l s σ u l s b m σ m σ n 10 7 σ m σ n 10 7 b m decreased from 0 973 to 0 930 0 944 to 0 921 and 0 927 to 0 826 respectively on the contrary both l e x t and t s p have a significant influence on θ s l s since l e x t and t s p increase from 2d to 5d and 1 3 m θ s l s θ s l s b m decreases from 0 9 to 0 81 and 0 93 to 0 83 respectively these are attributed to the higher overburden pressures due to the scour protection layer that increase the confining stresses of the soil around the pile especially in the upper soil layers and reduce a few meters of cantilever length of the support structure of offshore wind turbine by scour protection 5 conclusions in this paper the effect of scour protection on monopile behavior including the first natural frequency the maximum pile stress under uls the rotation at mudline of the pile under sls and the fatigue stress under fls were investigated by numerical methods the numerical model was constructed on the platform of abaqus and validated by model tests the nrel 5 mw wind turbine supported by a monopile foundation at 20 m water depth was used as a reference model and a parametric study was carried out to examine the influence of several design factors the findings of this paper are summarized as follows 1 the first natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine with scour protection is higher than that of the case without scour protection which can mostly be ignored in the design of offshore wind turbine structure 2 the scour protection has a small positive influence on the monopile behavior under both ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state 3 the scour protection can noticeably reduce the cross sectional rotation of the pile at mudline under the serviceability limit state considering that rotation is a common design driver for monopile foundations it is necessary that further optimization of monopile design incorporates the contribution of scour protection 4 based on the sensitivity analysis the density of the rock and the thickness of the scour protection have a relatively significant positive effect on the first natural frequency and monopile behavior under uls sls and fls although the results of the study are focused on applications to monopile foundations with a static scour protection the research method can be extended to other foundations such as jackets tripods and gravity based foundations moreover the monopile behavior should be investigated with a dynamic scour protection and load conditions should be considered as dynamic in the future credit authorship contribution statement hongwang ma methodology finite element model and analysis data curation model

wdr and modify the dynamic adaptive yawing response model at the same time the wyf algorithm did not rely on wdr dynamic mechanism model but only extracted system information from the output data of yawing system simulation experiments and sea trials were carried out and the results showed that the wyf could keep fast tracking speed and smooth the noisy data effectively under both precise model and perturbed model keywords wave driven robot adaptive model lag compensation extended kalman filter model perturbation 1 introduction with the development of science and technology the development of the ocean has gradually attracted people s attention the long term observation of the marine environment is of great significance to the scientific research and production activities in many aspects such as the design of marine equipment meteorology research and so on various types of unmanned intelligent marine observation platforms have been designed and applied by researchers including usv auv rov etc bingham et al 2012 these platforms usually carry batteries to provide energy for the control systems and propulsion systems due to the limitation of energy their maximum observation area is usually several kilometers or hundreds of kilometers and the maximum observation time is usually several hours to several days therefore these observation platforms are usually used for short term small scale environmental observation yu et al 2016 wave driven robot wdr is a new type of ocean vehicle with special multibody structure it uses its own mechanical structure to capture the continuous wave energy in the ocean and convert it into sailing power the control system is powered by solar energy therefore wdrs have the feature of unlimited voyage and can be used to carry out long term large scale ocean observation tasks they have been used in many fields such as long term observation of the marine environment marine life migration tracking maritime communication relay and so on li et al 2017 manley and willcox 2010a mitarai and mcwilliams 2016 a wdr consists of two sub components the floating body float on the water surface and the submerged body glider under water the two sub components are connected by the umbilical which not only realizes power transmission but also carries out data communication between the float and the glider when the float heaves with the wave surface the farther away from the water surface the smaller the wave amplitude so the glider heaves relative to the water around it the hydrofoils mounted on the glider passively change their direction according to the different motion states of the glider therefore the force of the water on the hydrofoils always has a forward component independent of the wave direction that is the thrust of the wdr manley and willcox 2010b wang et al 2020 a rudder is installed on the glider to directly control the heading of the glider the heading control of the float is achieved indirectly by arranging the appropriate heading of the glider the operation principle of wdr is shown in fig 1 due to the limitation of energy consumption and the cost of wdr the heading sensors mounted on the float and the glider usually do not have high accuracy and there are some noises in the measured heading data this is obviously detrimental to the performance of the control system especially for controllers that need to use differential operations to obtain high order derivatives of the heading such as the commonly used discrete pid controller noise not only reduces the accuracy of heading control but also causes frequent steering resulting in unnecessary energy waste therefore the filtering processing of the heading information is an important part in the design of the control system of wdr kalman filter has been widely used in robots for noise reduction parameter identification controller parameter tuning of robots and so on li et al 2020a munguía et al 2019 kraus et al kraus and bingham 2011 established a simplified two dimensional model of wdr in the along track and heave directions by using the trimble proxt gps and a microstrain inertial measurement unit mounted on the wdr a well smoothed along track position and velocity estimate was realized based on extended kalman filter le et al 2015 proposed a two layer kalman filter to estimate and eliminate the influence of near surface environment on rov heading observation annamalai et al 2013 proposed interval kalman filter ikf for heading estimation of the springer usv given the bounded range of possible compass models the ikf estimate provided guaranteed bounds to a statistically optimal kf estimate ghorbani et al ghorbani 2016 designed a kalman filter based on nomoto model identified by cifer software to estimate states of the vessel aiming at the uncertainty of measurement noise covariance matrix emami et al emami and taban 2018 proposed an adaptive kalman filter akf that estimation window length is tuned adaptively by detecting the noise distribution variations for auv speed estimation li et al 2018 proposed an adaptive kalman filter based on extended kalman filter ekf framework by dynamically linearizing the yaw motion model of usv however there are some difficulties when applying the kalman filter to the heading observation of wdr kalman filter relies on the precise dynamic model of wdr wdr is a special multibody structure including two rigid bodies and a flexible umbilical under high sea conditions the flexible umbilical is alternately relaxed and tensioned and the coupling effect between the float and the glider cannot be accurately estimated in addition due to the low speed of wdr its motion model is also extremely susceptible to the unknown influence of the ocean environment therefore it is difficult to establish an accurate wdr dynamic model which makes the traditional kalman filter cannot keep good performance in wdr multibody heading estimation tracking differentiator td is a filter not based on the object model it has few parameters simple structure excellent noise reduction effect and it can obtain high order derivative information of the input signal so td has been widely used in engineering the disadvantage of td is that there is a certain lag between the filtered output and the input signal shen et al 2020 proposed the finite time tracking differentiator ftd to estimate the position and velocity of marine vehicle the ftd can converge the position and velocity errors to zero in finite time peng et al jian liang et al 2015 introduced a phase adjusting gene into traditional td and designed a new optimal control synthesis function tian et al 2013 designed a feedforward of the input signal in solving the equations of the differentiator qiao et al 2009 proposed the self adaptive td which can automatically adjust its tracking rate based on the change rate of the input signal however the above methods only reduce the phase lag of the td but not eliminate it feng et al 2018 discussed the compensation method for td output lag however the lag compensation cannot be adjusted adaptively in this paper a wave driven robot multibody yawing filter wyf was proposed to estimate the multibody heading information of wdr under the influence of noise and uncertain model perturbation firstly the multibody yawing dynamic model of wdr was introduced combining td and taylor series expansion the dynamic adaptive yawing response models of the float and the glider were derived then based on ekf framework the filter calculation loop of wyf was designed in which the multibody heading information was estimated and the adaptive yawing response model was updated at the same time finally through simulation and sea trial results it was verified that the proposed wyf has fast tracking speed and excellent filtering effect under model perturbation 2 dynamic modeling of wdr many methods such as newton euler method wang et al 2019 kane method qi et al 2013 and d h method tian et al 2015a 2015b were used to describe the wdr motion model which has strong nonlinear characteristics li et al 2020b analyzed the coupling relationship between the sub components of wdr in detail and proposed the dynamic model of wdr taking the ocean ramblerⅱ wdr as the research object the effectiveness of the model wad verified through a tank test the main parameters of the ocean ramblerⅱ wdr are shown in table 1 in this paper the simulation experiments were carried out on the basis of this model for detailed derivation of this model please refer to li et al 2020b three body fixed frames and an earth fixed frame are established as shown in fig 2 the three body fixed frames are used to describe the motion of the float the glider and the whole wdr system the origin of the earth fixed frame is a fixed point on the earth the dynamic model of wdr is shown in eq 1 the meanings of the variables in eq 1 are shown in table 2 1 m r b v c r b ν ν f m a ν r f c a ν r d ν r g η τ the motion responses of wdr in 6 degrees of freedom are described in eq 1 which are the surge sway rolling and pitching of wdr and the yawing of the float and the glider in this paper only the yawing motion responses of the float and the glider is studied so eq 1 can be simplified as 2 i z f λ 66 f r f m f x g f u f r f n r r f r f r f n τ f i z g λ 66 g r g n r r g r g r g n τ g eq 2 represents the wdr yawing response model which only includes two degrees of freedom the yawing of the float and the yawing of the glider in the first line of eq 2 r f is the angular velocity of the float i z f is the moment of inertia of the float around the z f axis λ 66 f is the added moment of inertia coefficient of the float m f is the mass of the float x g f is the x coordinate of gravity center of the glider in float frame u f is the surge velocity of the float n r r f is the yawing damping coefficient of the float n τ f is the yawing control moment of the float in the second line of eq 2 the right superscript of the motion state variable f is changed to g which indicates that the object described by the motion variable changes from the float to the glider for example r g represents the angular velocity of the glider similarly the meaning of other motion state variables of the glider in eq 2 can be obtained for n τ f and n τ g they are calculated respectively according to the different turning control modes of the float and the glider the turning of the glider is directly controlled by the projection y τ g of the rudder lift on the y g axis the turning of the float is due to the difference of the heading between the float and the glider when the projection of the tension of the umbilical in the horizontal direction is different from the current heading of the float a turning moment will be generated on the float therefore n τ f and n τ g are calculated according to eq 3 3 n τ f f l f sin ψ g ψ f n τ g y τ g l g where ψ f and ψ g represent the heading of the float and the heading of the glider respectively f represents the projection of the tension of the umbilical in the horizontal direction l f is the distance between the hinge point of the umbilical on the float and the gravity center of the float l g is the distance between the rudder and gravity center of the glider in summary the discrete wdr yawing response model can be obtained 4 ψ g k 1 ψ g k r g k δ t r g k 1 r g k r g k δ t r g n r r g r g r g y τ g l g i z g λ 66 g ψ f k 1 ψ f k 1 r f k δ t r f k 1 r f k r f k δ t r f n r r f r f r f f l f sin ψ g ψ f m f

working principle is that based on the structure of kalman filter the first order taylor series expansion method is used to reasonably approximate the nonlinear model sabet et al 2014 shariati et al 2019 for the nonlinear state space equation of the system 5 x k 1 f x k u k w k y k h x k v k where x k is the vector of state variables at the k th moment u k and y k respectively represent the input vector and observable output vector of the system w k is the process noise and v k is the measurement noise their covariance matrices are q and r respectively f 和 h respectively represent the state transition function and observation function of the nonlinear system the ekf algorithm can be divided into two parts prediction and measurement update the following operations are performed at each step prediction 6 x k 1 k f x k u k 7 p k 1 k f k 1 k p k f k 1 k t q update 8 k k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t h k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t r 1 9 x k 1 x k 1 k k k 1 y k 1 h x k 1 k 10 p k 1 i k k 1 h k 1 p k 1 k 11 y k 1 h x k 1 where f and h are jacobian matrices of state transition function f and observation function h respectively they are defined as follows hu et al 2019 12 f k k 1 f m n f m x n x k 1 13 h k h p q h p x q x k k 1 according to the above ekf algorithm for the wdr yawing response system eq 4 the vector of state variables x k can be taken as 14 x k ψ g k r g k r g ψ f k r f k r f t y k is defined as 15 y k ψ g k ψ f k t the jacobian matrix of the state transition function is 16 f 1 δ t 0 0 0 0 0 1 δ t 0 0 0 0 2 n r r g r g sign r g i z g λ 66 g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 δ t 0 0 0 0 0 1 δ t f l f

according to the wdr yawing response system eq 4 and the ekf algorithm eqs 6 11 the heading data of the float and the glider can be filtered 3 2 the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr 1 the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the glider according to eq 4 the yawing response model of the glider can be expressed in the following generalized form 18 ψ g k 1 ψ g k r g k δ t r g k 1 r g k f r g y τ g w g δ t in eq 18 the yawing response model of the glider can be regarded as a pure second order integral system the input of the system is f r g y τ g w g which is called generalized rudder angle w g represents the disturbance to the system which includes the parameter errors between the model above and the actual model and the yawing moment generated by the complex marine environment on the glider therefore in the actual marine environment the generalized rudder angle f r g y τ g w g is real in physical sense but it is a function that cannot be calculated accurately in advance tracking differentiator td is usually used to denoise the data and approximate the multi order derivative of input data the advantage of td is that it only relies on the real time collected data to complete the filtering and does not need an accurate mathematical model of the system it is a data driven filtering method however the disadvantage of td is that there is a lag between the filtered output and the input signal the second order discrete td structure of the glider is as follows 19 v 1 g k 1 v 1 g k h v 2 g k v 2 g k 1 v 2 g k h f h g k f h g k f h a n v 1 g k ψ s g k v 2 g k r g h 0 g where ψ s g k is the heading of the glider measured by the heading sensor v 1 g k and v 2 g k are the outputs of td which respectively represent the smoothing result of ψ s g and the approximate value of the first derivative of ψ s g at the k th moment h is the sampling period r g and h 0 g are the design parameters of td which respectively affect the tracking speed and filtering strength of td to the input signal f h a n x 1 k x 2 k r h 0 is the fastest control synthesis function it is defined as follows 20 d r h 0 d 0 h 0 d y x 1 h 0 x 2 a 0 d 2 8 r y a x 2 a 0 d 2 s i g n y y d 0 x 2 y h 0 y d 0 f h a n r s i g n a a d r a d a d comparing eq 18 with eq 19 it can be found that they have the same structure therefore the following conclusion can be drawn eq 19 can output a fitted value of the actual generalized rudder angle i e f h g k due to the characteristics of td f h g k lags behind the actual generalized rudder angle construct a mathematical model as follows 21 z 1 g k z 1 g k d g k z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 g k z 2 g k 1 z 2 k h f h g k f h g k f h a n v 1 g k v g k v 2 g k r g h 0 g where z 1 g k is the forward d g k step correction of z 1 g k since the input of eq 21 is the f h g k which lags behind the actual generalized rudder angle the first line of eq 21 compensates for the lag of z 1 g k relative to the actual heading information so that the variable z 1 g k can be used to describe the heading of the glider eq 21 is the primary form of the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the glider although the structure of eq 21 is similar to that of eq 19 eq 21 is essentially different from eq 19 on the one hand in eq 19 the values of v 1 g k and v 2 g k interact with the value of function f h g k v 1 g k and v 2 g k are used as the input of f h g k however in eq 21 z 1 g k and z 2 g k cannot affect the value of f h g k on the other hand the variables in eq 19 are updated according to the second order td algorithm based on the input heading data in each iteration cycle however the variables in eq 21 are updated based on ekf framework in the filter calculation loop which will be introduced in section 3 3 from eq 21 it can be seen that only the values of z 1 g k and z 2 g k can be calculated through the input f h g k whereas the value of z 1 g k cannot be calculated this is mainly caused by two problems one is that in the first line of eq 21 z 1 g k d g k is an unknown nonlinear function and the other is that the input of this nonlinear function i e d g k is also unknown for the first problem based on the taylor series expansion the nonlinear function z 1 g k d g k can be approximated by a linear function the approximate value of z 1 g k can be obtained by expanding z 1 g k at z 1 g k and retaining only the first derivative term 22 z 1 g k z 1 g k d g k z 1 g k 0 z 1 g k 1 d k z 1 g n k n d k n r n g x z 1 g k z 1 g k z 2 k g d g k where r n x is the remainder of the taylor series expansion according to eq 22 as long as the value of d g k is known the value of z 1 g k can be calculated for d g it can be expanded into the vector of state variables of wdr and estimated according to the ekf framework which will be introduced in section 3 3 however the premise of this method is that the state transition equation of d g is known in order to solve this problem the feedback control law of the parameter r g in the fastest control synthesis function f h a n is designed as follows 23 r g k 1 r 0 g c g ψ s g k v 1 g k where r 0 g and c g are design parameters and both are constants at this time eq 19 has the following properties when the change of ψ s g increases the values of ψ s g k v 1 k and r g increase thereby increasing the tracking speed of v 1 g to ψ s g otherwise r g will be reduced which will reduce the tracking speed and improve the filtering effect the feedback control law shown in eq 23 can make the tracking speed of v 1 g to ψ s g be adaptively adjusted according to the change of ψ s g so that the lag between v 1 g and ψ s g can be kept relatively stable since both z 1 g and v 1 g are double integrals of f h g the lag between z 1 g and the actual heading information is also relatively stable therefore the forward correction step size d g will not change significantly at adjacent moments then d g can be approximately regarded as a constant this is equivalent to establishing the state transition equation of d g 24 d g k 1 d g k then according to eq 22 and eq 24 for two adjacent moments 25 z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k z 1 g k 1 z 2 g k 1 d g k 1 z 1 g k z 2 k g d g k z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k z 2 g k 1 z 2 k g d g k take eq 21 into eq 25 then eq 25 can be simplified to 26 z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 g k h d g k f h g k combining eq 26 eq 21 and eq 19 the following dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the glider can be obtained 27 z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 g k h d g k f h g k z 2 g k 1 z 2 g k h f h g k v 1 g k 1 v 1 g k h v 2 g k v 2 g k 1 v 2 g k h f h g k r g k 1 r 0 g c g ψ s g k v 1 g k d g k 1 d g k f h g k f h a n v 1 g k ψ s g k v 2 g k r g h 0 g where z 1 g represents the heading of the glider different from the model established by dynamic mechanism in eq 4 eq 27 is a data driven model that uses the output data of the system to describe the yawing response system of the glider 2 the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the float according to eq 4 although the yawing response model of the float is different from that of the glider similar to eq 18 the yawing response system of the float can be expressed in the following generalized form 28 ψ g k 1 ψ g k r g k δ t r g k 1 r g k f r f ψ f ψ g u f w f δ t the yawing response model of the float can also be regarded as a pure second order integral system under the control of the generalized rudder angle f r f ψ f ψ g u f w f where w g is the disturbance to the system therefore a process similar to the previous section can be used to derive the yawing response model of the float 29 z 1 f k 1 z 1 f k h z 2 f k h d f k f h f k z 2 f k 1 z 2 f k h f h f k v 1 f k 1 v 1 f k h v 2 f k v 2 f k 1 v 2 f k h f h f k r f k 1 r 0 f c f ψ s f k v 1 f k d f k 1 d f k f h f k f h a n v 1 f k ψ s f k v 2 f k r f h 0 f where z 1 f represents the heading of the float ψ s f k is the heading information of the float collected by the heading sensor 3 3 the wdr multibody yawing filter wyf for the wyf algorithm it contains two loops the adaptive model construction loop and the filter calculation loop the structure of wyf algorithm is shown in fig 3 in the adaptive model construction loop firstly through the third fourth and seventh lines of eq 27 and eq 29 the generalized rudder angle fitted values of the float and the glider f h f k and f h g k which lag behind the actual values are calculated by using the heading of the float and the glider collected by heading sensors then input them into the filter calculation loop and update r g and r f to adjust the tracking speed the setting of parameters in r g and r f is affected by many aspects such as the noise of heading sensor the values of h 0 g and h 0 f the maneuverability of wdr the requirements of the control task etc taking r g as an example the selection guidelines for parameters r 0 g and c g are as follows 1 the lag between the output of td v 1 g and the input signal ψ s g should be kept relatively stable this is equivalent to establishing the state transition equation of d g that is d g k 1 d g k and provides the basis for the identification of d g in the filter calculation td refers to the third fourth and seventh lines of eq 27 2 td should not only be able to track the input signal in time but also have enough ability to suppress the noise of the input signal the larger the rate factor r g the faster the tracking speed of td to the input data but the ability of td to suppress noise will decrease since the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr is based on the output of td the selection of r 0 g and c g needs to balance the tracking speed and filtering strength of td too fast tracking speed or too high filtering strength is detrimental to the performance of wyf in the filter calculation loop the vector of state variables is set as 30 x k z 1 g k z 2 g k d g k z 1 f k z 2 f k d f k t in addition to the heading state information of the float and the glider the state variables also contain the forward correction step size d g k and d f k in the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr wyf makes online corrections to d g k and d f k based on the observed heading of the float and the glider the input vector of the system u k is set as 31 u k 0 f h f k 0 0 f h g k 0 t the observable output vector of the system y k is set as 32 y k z 1 g k z 1 f k t combining eq 27 and eq 29 the wdr yawing response state space equation is 33 z 1 f k 1 z 1 f k h z 2 f k h d f k f h f k z 2 f k 1 z 2 f k h f h f k d f k 1 d f k z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 f k h d g k f h g k z 2 f k 1 z 2 f k h f h g k d g k 1 d g k the jacobian matrix of the state transition function is 34 f 1 h h f h f k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 h h f h g k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 the jacobian matrix of the observation function is 35 h 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 then based on the ekf framework in section 3 1 the state variables can be modified online and the multibody heading information of wdr can be estimated the following operations are performed at each step 1 one step prediction of the vector of state variables according to eq 33 36 x k 1 k f x k u k 2 one step

framework the state space equation in wyf is established online based on the output data of wdr yawing system which makes wyf independent of the precise mechanism model of the control system this is different from the traditional ekf that relies on the wdr yawing dynamic mechanism model in section 3 1 therefore wyf has good adaptability and robustness under the unknown wdr model perturbation which will be verified in the simulation and sea trial results in the next section the dynamic mechanism model used in traditional ekf can be used for motion mechanism analysis motion prediction etc while the state space equation established by using the output data of yawing system in wyf can only be used to estimate the heading information of wdr 4 simulation and sea trial results in order to compare the performance of basic wdr yawing ekf td and the proposed wyf in the estimation of multibody heading information of wdr numerical simulation experiments and sea trial were carried out the parameters of wdr yawing response model are shown in table 3 the maximum angle of the rudder on the glider was 30 corresponding to the maximum lift of 1 5 n to simplify the calculation it was assumed that the lift varies linearly with respect to the rudder angle 4 1 simulation under precise model the iteration step size of the simulation program was set to 0 1s the initial headings and angular velocities of the float and the glider were set to 0 the measurement noise of two heading sensors obeyed gaussian distribution n 0 5 for the td of the float and the glider r g and r f were all set to 3 h 0 g and h 0 f were all set to 2 in the proposed wyf r 0 f and r 0 g were set to 2 5 c f and c g were set to 0 1 h 0 f and h 0 g were set to 2 the initial value of the vector of the state variable was set as 42 x 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t the rudder angle changed as follows 43 δ t 20 sin 0 1 t the root mean square rms is defined as follows to describe the filtering effect 44 r m s 1 t k 1 t ψ k ψ r e a l k 2 where ψ k is the estimated heading and ψ r e a l k is the actual heading at the k th moment the simulation results are shown in figs 4 9 and table 4 from figs 4 7 ekf td and wyf all could effectively reduce the noise of heading sensors and accurately estimate the actual heading of the float and the glider under precise model the output results of ekf and td were smoother while wyf was more affected by noise and the output results of wyf fluctuated slightly around the actual value but overall the smoothing effect of wyf was also satisfactory ekf and wyf tracked the multibody heading information of wdr quickly while the heading of the float and the glider estimated by td lagged behind the actual values from figs 8 and 9 the forward correction step sizes d f and d g both quickly rose to around 4 after about 10 s and then fluctuated in a small range finally d f was stable at about 4 1 and d g was stable at about 4 27 this indicated that the proposed dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr could keep a stable tracking speed through the adaptive adjustment of r g and r f from table 4 although all the three filters could effectively smooth the data of the heading sensors there were lags between the heading of the float and the glider estimated by td and the actual heading values resulting in large differences between the output results of td and the actual heading values at each sampling step therefore compared with the rms values of the heading sensors the rmss values of td were larger the rms values of ekf and wyf were less than the rms values of heading sensors which means that ekf and wyf achieved satisfactory results in tracking speed and noise reduction ability in general under precise wdr yawing model the performance of the three filters was ekf wyf td 4 2 simulation under perturbed model when wdr is sailing in the actual marine environment the hydrodynamic coefficients of the wdr yawing response model are not constants that can be accurately determined and predicted there are many reasons for this such as the attack of waves the change of the attitude of the hydrofoils the change of the draft of the float and so on therefore under actual conditions the wdr yawing response model is usually accompanied by continuous and random perturbation investigating the performance of the filter under the perturbed model is of great value to its practical application in the wdr yawing response model in this section n r r f and n r r g were set as follows 45 n r r f 200 100 rand 1 46 n r r g 120 100 rand 1 the initial state of wdr the change rule of rudder angle and filter parameters were the same as those in section 4 1 the simulation results are shown in figs 10 15 and table 5 remark n r r f and n r r g in eq 45 and eq 46 only referred to the hydrodynamic coefficients in the wdr yawing response model eq 4 while in ekf n r r f and n r r g in the jacobian matrix of the state transition function eq 16 were the same as those in section 4 1 that is n r r f 200 and n r r f 120 from figs 10 13 when the model parameters were perturbed ekf could smooth the sensor data successfully but the heading of the float and the glider estimated by ekf could not track the actual heading values the perturbation of the model had a great influence on the estimation accuracy of ekf in contrast the filtering capabilities of td and wyf were not sensitive to model perturbation and could keep stable filtering effects compared with td wyf could track the actual multibody heading information more quickly but the smoothness of the outputs was slightly less than that of td from figs 14 and 15 the rise time of d f was about 10s after a period of small adjustments d f finally was stable at about 4 15 the rise time of d g was about 18s and d g finally stabilized at about 4 35 the simulation results showed that the proposed dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr still kept stable tracking speed and had excellent robustness under perturbed model from table 5 the proposed wyf not only effectively suppressed the noise of sensor data but also had fast tracking speed therefore compared with the rms values of heading sensors the rms values of wyf were reduced the rms values of ekf and td were greater than the rms values of heading sensors but they were caused by different reasons ekf method cannot accurately estimate the actual heading of the float and the glider under model perturbation while the rms values of td were large due to the lags of the output results in a word the performance of the three filters was wyf td ekf when the model parameters of wdr were randomly perturbed 4 3 sea trial results in order to verify the filtering effect of the proposed wyf algorithm sea trials were carried out in qingdao china with the ocean ramblerⅱ wdr as the experimental platform as shown in fig 16 two magnetic compasses were used to measure the heading of the float and the glider the two circles in fig 17 were the installation positions of the two magnetic compasses the period of the wdr control system was 1s both r 0 f and r 0 g were set to 0 01 in the wyf algorithm all other parameters of the three filters were the same as those in section 4 1 the sea trial results are shown in figs 18 21 from figs 18 21 under the disturbance of the complex marine environment such as wave attack the heading of the float and the glider estimated by ekf were quite different from the headings measured by the sensors obviously the model perturbation caused by the marine environment had a great impact on the estimation accuracy of ekf for td it still maintained a good and stable filtering effect under real sea conditions the outputs of td were very smooth however due to the lag effect of td on the one hand it was unable for td to estimate the multibody heading information of wdr in time on the other hand when the heading changes sharply in the reverse direction it was easy for td to lose some data for example at around the 95th second in fig 18 the heading of the float increased continuously at first then reached the maximum heading of 53 at the 95th second and then decreased continuously due to the lag between the output and the input of td the input of td had dropped before the output reached 53 which caused the output to drop accordingly and thus part of the heading information was lost wyf could track the multibody heading information measured by sensors in time under the disturbance of the complex marine environment meanwhile wyf could effectively smooth the sawtooth in the data while reflecting the heading changes as much as possible compared with ekf and td the filtering effect of wyf was improved effectively the sea trial results showed that wyf was of excellent practical value in estimating the multibody heading information of wdr 5 conclusions in this paper the wyf algorithm was proposed to estimate the multibody heading information of wdr under the influence of noise and uncertain model perturbation wyf did not rely on the accurate dynamic model of wdr but only extracted system information from the output data of yawing system the generalized rudder angles of the float and the glider were fitted by td with adaptive tracking speed and the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr with delay compensation was proposed to describe the state transition equation of the yawing system based on the ekf framework the estimation of the heading of the float and the glider and the update of the adaptive yawing response model were realized at the same time simulation experiments and sea trials were carried out and the multibody heading estimation results of ekf td and wyf were compared the results showed that the proposed wyf had excellent tracking speed and could effectively suppress the noise of sensor data in addition wyf could accurately estimate the multibody heading information of wdr under both precise model and perturbed model credit authorship

20744,wave driven robot wdr is a new type of ocean vehicle with special multibody structure aiming at the wdr multibody heading filtering problem under model perturbation the wdr multibody yawing filter wyf with dynamic adaptive model was proposed in this paper the wyf algorithm included adaptive model construction loop and filter calculation loop the tracking differentiator td with adaptive tracking speed was designed to fit the generalized rudder angles of the floating body float and the submerged body glider based on the taylor series expansion the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr with delay compensation was proposed the filter calculation loop was developed within the extended kalman filter ekf framework which could estimate the multibody heading information of wdr and modify the dynamic adaptive yawing response model at the same time the wyf algorithm did not rely on wdr dynamic mechanism model but only extracted system information from the output data of yawing system simulation experiments and sea trials were carried out and the results showed that the wyf could keep fast tracking speed and smooth the noisy data effectively under both precise model and perturbed model keywords wave driven robot adaptive model lag compensation extended kalman filter model perturbation 1 introduction with the development of science and technology the development of the ocean has gradually attracted people s attention the long term observation of the marine environment is of great significance to the scientific research and production activities in many aspects such as the design of marine equipment meteorology research and so on various types of unmanned intelligent marine observation platforms have been designed and applied by researchers including usv auv rov etc bingham et al 2012 these platforms usually carry batteries to provide energy for the control systems and propulsion systems due to the limitation of energy their maximum observation area is usually several kilometers or hundreds of kilometers and the maximum observation time is usually several hours to several days therefore these observation platforms are usually used for short term small scale environmental observation yu et al 2016 wave driven robot wdr is a new type of ocean vehicle with special multibody structure it uses its own mechanical structure to capture the continuous wave energy in the ocean and convert it into sailing power the control system is powered by solar energy therefore wdrs have the feature of unlimited voyage and can be used to carry out long term large scale ocean observation tasks they have been used in many fields such as long term observation of the marine environment marine life migration tracking maritime communication relay and so on li et al 2017 manley and willcox 2010a mitarai and mcwilliams 2016 a wdr consists of two sub components the floating body float on the water surface and the submerged body glider under water the two sub components are connected by the umbilical which not only realizes power transmission but also carries out data communication between the float and the glider when the float heaves with the wave surface the farther away from the water surface the smaller the wave amplitude so the glider heaves relative to the water around it the hydrofoils mounted on the glider passively change their direction according to the different motion states of the glider therefore the force of the water on the hydrofoils always has a forward component independent of the wave direction that is the thrust of the wdr manley and willcox 2010b wang et al 2020 a rudder is installed on the glider to directly control the heading of the glider the heading control of the float is achieved indirectly by arranging the appropriate heading of the glider the operation principle of wdr is shown in fig 1 due to the limitation of energy consumption and the cost of wdr the heading sensors mounted on the float and the glider usually do not have high accuracy and there are some noises in the measured heading data this is obviously detrimental to the performance of the control system especially for controllers that need to use differential operations to obtain high order derivatives of the heading such as the commonly used discrete pid controller noise not only reduces the accuracy of heading control but also causes frequent steering resulting in unnecessary energy waste therefore the filtering processing of the heading information is an important part in the design of the control system of wdr kalman filter has been widely used in robots for noise reduction parameter identification controller parameter tuning of robots and so on li et al 2020a munguía et al 2019 kraus et al kraus and bingham 2011 established a simplified two dimensional model of wdr in the along track and heave directions by using the trimble proxt gps and a microstrain inertial measurement unit mounted on the wdr a well smoothed along track position and velocity estimate was realized based on extended kalman filter le et al 2015 proposed a two layer kalman filter to estimate and eliminate the influence of near surface environment on rov heading observation annamalai et al 2013 proposed interval kalman filter ikf for heading estimation of the springer usv given the bounded range of possible compass models the ikf estimate provided guaranteed bounds to a statistically optimal kf estimate ghorbani et al ghorbani 2016 designed a kalman filter based on nomoto model identified by cifer software to estimate states of the vessel aiming at the uncertainty of measurement noise covariance matrix emami et al emami and taban 2018 proposed an adaptive kalman filter akf that estimation window length is tuned adaptively by detecting the noise distribution variations for auv speed estimation li et al 2018 proposed an adaptive kalman filter based on extended kalman filter ekf framework by dynamically linearizing the yaw motion model of usv however there are some difficulties when applying the kalman filter to the heading observation of wdr kalman filter relies on the precise dynamic model of wdr wdr is a special multibody structure including two rigid bodies and a flexible umbilical under high sea conditions the flexible umbilical is alternately relaxed and tensioned and the coupling effect between the float and the glider cannot be accurately estimated in addition due to the low speed of wdr its motion model is also extremely susceptible to the unknown influence of the ocean environment therefore it is difficult to establish an accurate wdr dynamic model which makes the traditional kalman filter cannot keep good performance in wdr multibody heading estimation tracking differentiator td is a filter not based on the object model it has few parameters simple structure excellent noise reduction effect and it can obtain high order derivative information of the input signal so td has been widely used in engineering the disadvantage of td is that there is a certain lag between the filtered output and the input signal shen et al 2020 proposed the finite time tracking differentiator ftd to estimate the position and velocity of marine vehicle the ftd can converge the position and velocity errors to zero in finite time peng et al jian liang et al 2015 introduced a phase adjusting gene into traditional td and designed a new optimal control synthesis function tian et al 2013 designed a feedforward of the input signal in solving the equations of the differentiator qiao et al 2009 proposed the self adaptive td which can automatically adjust its tracking rate based on the change rate of the input signal however the above methods only reduce the phase lag of the td but not eliminate it feng et al 2018 discussed the compensation method for td output lag however the lag compensation cannot be adjusted adaptively in this paper a wave driven robot multibody yawing filter wyf was proposed to estimate the multibody heading information of wdr under the influence of noise and uncertain model perturbation firstly the multibody yawing dynamic model of wdr was introduced combining td and taylor series expansion the dynamic adaptive yawing response models of the float and the glider were derived then based on ekf framework the filter calculation loop of wyf was designed in which the multibody heading information was estimated and the adaptive yawing response model was updated at the same time finally through simulation and sea trial results it was verified that the proposed wyf has fast tracking speed and excellent filtering effect under model perturbation 2 dynamic modeling of wdr many methods such as newton euler method wang et al 2019 kane method qi et al 2013 and d h method tian et al 2015a 2015b were used to describe the wdr motion model which has strong nonlinear characteristics li et al 2020b analyzed the coupling relationship between the sub components of wdr in detail and proposed the dynamic model of wdr taking the ocean ramblerⅱ wdr as the research object the effectiveness of the model wad verified through a tank test the main parameters of the ocean ramblerⅱ wdr are shown in table 1 in this paper the simulation experiments were carried out on the basis of this model for detailed derivation of this model please refer to li et al 2020b three body fixed frames and an earth fixed frame are established as shown in fig 2 the three body fixed frames are used to describe the motion of the float the glider and the whole wdr system the origin of the earth fixed frame is a fixed point on the earth the dynamic model of wdr is shown in eq 1 the meanings of the variables in eq 1 are shown in table 2 1 m r b v c r b ν ν f m a ν r f c a ν r d ν r g η τ the motion responses of wdr in 6 degrees of freedom are described in eq 1 which are the surge sway rolling and pitching of wdr and the yawing of the float and the glider in this paper only the yawing motion responses of the float and the glider is studied so eq 1 can be simplified as 2 i z f λ 66 f r f m f x g f u f r f n r r f r f r f n τ f i z g λ 66 g r g n r r g r g r g n τ g eq 2 represents the wdr yawing response model which only includes two degrees of freedom the yawing of the float and the yawing of the glider in the first line of eq 2 r f is the angular velocity of the float i z f is the moment of inertia of the float around the z f axis λ 66 f is the added moment of inertia coefficient of the float m f is the mass of the float x g f is the x coordinate of gravity center of the glider in float frame u f is the surge velocity of the float n r r f is the yawing damping coefficient of the float n τ f is the yawing control moment of the float in the second line of eq 2 the right superscript of the motion state variable f is changed to g which indicates that the object described by the motion variable changes from the float to the glider for example r g represents the angular velocity of the glider similarly the meaning of other motion state variables of the glider in eq 2 can be obtained for n τ f and n τ g they are calculated respectively according to the different turning control modes of the float and the glider the turning of the glider is directly controlled by the projection y τ g of the rudder lift on the y g axis the turning of the float is due to the difference of the heading between the float and the glider when the projection of the tension of the umbilical in the horizontal direction is different from the current heading of the float a turning moment will be generated on the float therefore n τ f and n τ g are calculated according to eq 3 3 n τ f f l f sin ψ g ψ f n τ g y τ g l g where ψ f and ψ g represent the heading of the float and the heading of the glider respectively f represents the projection of the tension of the umbilical in the horizontal direction l f is the distance between the hinge point of the umbilical on the float and the gravity center of the float l g is the distance between the rudder and gravity center of the glider in summary the discrete wdr yawing response model can be obtained 4 ψ g k 1 ψ g k r g k δ t r g k 1 r g k r g k δ t r g n r r g r g r g y τ g l g i z g λ 66 g ψ f k 1 ψ f k 1 r f k δ t r f k 1 r f k r f k δ t r f n r r f r f r f f l f sin ψ g ψ f m f x g f u f r f i z f λ 66 f 3 wdr multibody yawing filter with dynamic adaptive model 3 1 the basic wdr yawing ekf ekf is one of the commonly used methods for state estimation of nonlinear systems its working principle is that based on the structure of kalman filter the first order taylor series expansion method is used to reasonably approximate the nonlinear model sabet et al 2014 shariati et al 2019 for the nonlinear state space equation of the system 5 x k 1 f x k u k w k y k h x k v k where x k is the vector of state variables at the k th moment u k and y k respectively represent the input vector and observable output vector of the system w k is the process noise and v k is the measurement noise their covariance matrices are q and r respectively f 和 h respectively represent the state transition function and observation function of the nonlinear system the ekf algorithm can be divided into two parts prediction and measurement update the following operations are performed at each step prediction 6 x k 1 k f x k u k 7 p k 1 k f k 1 k p k f k 1 k t q update 8 k k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t h k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t r 1 9 x k 1 x k 1 k k k 1 y k 1 h x k 1 k 10 p k 1 i k k 1 h k 1 p k 1 k 11 y k 1 h x k 1 where f and h are jacobian matrices of state transition function f and observation function h respectively they are defined as follows hu et al 2019 12 f k k 1 f m n f m x n x k 1 13 h k h p q h p x q x k k 1 according to the above ekf algorithm for the wdr yawing response system eq 4 the vector of state variables x k can be taken as 14 x k ψ g k r g k r g ψ f k r f k r f t y k is defined as 15 y k ψ g k ψ f k t the jacobian matrix of the state transition function is 16 f 1 δ t 0 0 0 0 0 1 δ t 0 0 0 0 2 n r r g r g sign r g i z g λ 66 g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 δ t 0 0 0 0 0 1 δ t f l f cos ψ g ψ f i z f λ 66 f 0 0 f l f cos ψ g ψ f i z f λ 66 f 2 n r r f r f sign r f m f x g f u f i z f λ 66 f 0 the jacobian matrix of the observation function is 17 h 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 then according to the wdr yawing response system eq 4 and the ekf algorithm eqs 6 11 the heading data of the float and the glider can be filtered 3 2 the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr 1 the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the glider according to eq 4 the yawing response model of the glider can be expressed in the following generalized form 18 ψ g k 1 ψ g k r g k δ t r g k 1 r g k f r g y τ g w g δ t in eq 18 the yawing response model of the glider can be regarded as a pure second order integral system the input of the system is f r g y τ g w g which is called generalized rudder angle w g represents the disturbance to the system which includes the parameter errors between the model above and the actual model and the yawing moment generated by the complex marine environment on the glider therefore in the actual marine environment the generalized rudder angle f r g y τ g w g is real in physical sense but it is a function that cannot be calculated accurately in advance tracking differentiator td is usually used to denoise the data and approximate the multi order derivative of input data the advantage of td is that it only relies on the real time collected data to complete the filtering and does not need an accurate mathematical model of the system it is a data driven filtering method however the disadvantage of td is that there is a lag between the filtered output and the input signal the second order discrete td structure of the glider is as follows 19 v 1 g k 1 v 1 g k h v 2 g k v 2 g k 1 v 2 g k h f h g k f h g k f h a n v 1 g k ψ s g k v 2 g k r g h 0 g where ψ s g k is the heading of the glider measured by the heading sensor v 1 g k and v 2 g k are the outputs of td which respectively represent the smoothing result of ψ s g and the approximate value of the first derivative of ψ s g at the k th moment h is the sampling period r g and h 0 g are the design parameters of td which respectively affect the tracking speed and filtering strength of td to the input signal f h a n x 1 k x 2 k r h 0 is the fastest control synthesis function it is defined as follows 20 d r h 0 d 0 h 0 d y x 1 h 0 x 2 a 0 d 2 8 r y a x 2 a 0 d 2 s i g n y y d 0 x 2 y h 0 y d 0 f h a n r s i g n a a d r a d a d comparing eq 18 with eq 19 it can be found that they have the same structure therefore the following conclusion can be drawn eq 19 can output a fitted value of the actual generalized rudder angle i e f h g k due to the characteristics of td f h g k lags behind the actual generalized rudder angle construct a mathematical model as follows 21 z 1 g k z 1 g k d g k z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 g k z 2 g k 1 z 2 k h f h g k f h g k f h a n v 1 g k v g k v 2 g k r g h 0 g where z 1 g k is the forward d g k step correction of z 1 g k since the input of eq 21 is the f h g k which lags behind the actual generalized rudder angle the first line of eq 21 compensates for the lag of z 1 g k relative to the actual heading information so that the variable z 1 g k can be used to describe the heading of the glider eq 21 is the primary form of the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the glider although the structure of eq 21 is similar to that of eq 19 eq 21 is essentially different from eq 19 on the one hand in eq 19 the values of v 1 g k and v 2 g k interact with the value of function f h g k v 1 g k and v 2 g k are used as the input of f h g k however in eq 21 z 1 g k and z 2 g k cannot affect the value of f h g k on the other hand the variables in eq 19 are updated according to the second order td algorithm based on the input heading data in each iteration cycle however the variables in eq 21 are updated based on ekf framework in the filter calculation loop which will be introduced in section 3 3 from eq 21 it can be seen that only the values of z 1 g k and z 2 g k can be calculated through the input f h g k whereas the value of z 1 g k cannot be calculated this is mainly caused by two problems one is that in the first line of eq 21 z 1 g k d g k is an unknown nonlinear function and the other is that the input of this nonlinear function i e d g k is also unknown for the first problem based on the taylor series expansion the nonlinear function z 1 g k d g k can be approximated by a linear function the approximate value of z 1 g k can be obtained by expanding z 1 g k at z 1 g k and retaining only the first derivative term 22 z 1 g k z 1 g k d g k z 1 g k 0 z 1 g k 1 d k z 1 g n k n d k n r n g x z 1 g k z 1 g k z 2 k g d g k where r n x is the remainder of the taylor series expansion according to eq 22 as long as the value of d g k is known the value of z 1 g k can be calculated for d g it can be expanded into the vector of state variables of wdr and estimated according to the ekf framework which will be introduced in section 3 3 however the premise of this method is that the state transition equation of d g is known in order to solve this problem the feedback control law of the parameter r g in the fastest control synthesis function f h a n is designed as follows 23 r g k 1 r 0 g c g ψ s g k v 1 g k where r 0 g and c g are design parameters and both are constants at this time eq 19 has the following properties when the change of ψ s g increases the values of ψ s g k v 1 k and r g increase thereby increasing the tracking speed of v 1 g to ψ s g otherwise r g will be reduced which will reduce the tracking speed and improve the filtering effect the feedback control law shown in eq 23 can make the tracking speed of v 1 g to ψ s g be adaptively adjusted according to the change of ψ s g so that the lag between v 1 g and ψ s g can be kept relatively stable since both z 1 g and v 1 g are double integrals of f h g the lag between z 1 g and the actual heading information is also relatively stable therefore the forward correction step size d g will not change significantly at adjacent moments then d g can be approximately regarded as a constant this is equivalent to establishing the state transition equation of d g 24 d g k 1 d g k then according to eq 22 and eq 24 for two adjacent moments 25 z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k z 1 g k 1 z 2 g k 1 d g k 1 z 1 g k z 2 k g d g k z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k z 2 g k 1 z 2 k g d g k take eq 21 into eq 25 then eq 25 can be simplified to 26 z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 g k h d g k f h g k combining eq 26 eq 21 and eq 19 the following dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the glider can be obtained 27 z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 g k h d g k f h g k z 2 g k 1 z 2 g k h f h g k v 1 g k 1 v 1 g k h v 2 g k v 2 g k 1 v 2 g k h f h g k r g k 1 r 0 g c g ψ s g k v 1 g k d g k 1 d g k f h g k f h a n v 1 g k ψ s g k v 2 g k r g h 0 g where z 1 g represents the heading of the glider different from the model established by dynamic mechanism in eq 4 eq 27 is a data driven model that uses the output data of the system to describe the yawing response system of the glider 2 the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of the float according to eq 4 although the yawing response model of the float is different from that of the glider similar to eq 18 the yawing response system of the float can be expressed in the following generalized form 28 ψ g k 1 ψ g k r g k δ t r g k 1 r g k f r f ψ f ψ g u f w f δ t the yawing response model of the float can also be regarded as a pure second order integral system under the control of the generalized rudder angle f r f ψ f ψ g u f w f where w g is the disturbance to the system therefore a process similar to the previous section can be used to derive the yawing response model of the float 29 z 1 f k 1 z 1 f k h z 2 f k h d f k f h f k z 2 f k 1 z 2 f k h f h f k v 1 f k 1 v 1 f k h v 2 f k v 2 f k 1 v 2 f k h f h f k r f k 1 r 0 f c f ψ s f k v 1 f k d f k 1 d f k f h f k f h a n v 1 f k ψ s f k v 2 f k r f h 0 f where z 1 f represents the heading of the float ψ s f k is the heading information of the float collected by the heading sensor 3 3 the wdr multibody yawing filter wyf for the wyf algorithm it contains two loops the adaptive model construction loop and the filter calculation loop the structure of wyf algorithm is shown in fig 3 in the adaptive model construction loop firstly through the third fourth and seventh lines of eq 27 and eq 29 the generalized rudder angle fitted values of the float and the glider f h f k and f h g k which lag behind the actual values are calculated by using the heading of the float and the glider collected by heading sensors then input them into the filter calculation loop and update r g and r f to adjust the tracking speed the setting of parameters in r g and r f is affected by many aspects such as the noise of heading sensor the values of h 0 g and h 0 f the maneuverability of wdr the requirements of the control task etc taking r g as an example the selection guidelines for parameters r 0 g and c g are as follows 1 the lag between the output of td v 1 g and the input signal ψ s g should be kept relatively stable this is equivalent to establishing the state transition equation of d g that is d g k 1 d g k and provides the basis for the identification of d g in the filter calculation td refers to the third fourth and seventh lines of eq 27 2 td should not only be able to track the input signal in time but also have enough ability to suppress the noise of the input signal the larger the rate factor r g the faster the tracking speed of td to the input data but the ability of td to suppress noise will decrease since the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr is based on the output of td the selection of r 0 g and c g needs to balance the tracking speed and filtering strength of td too fast tracking speed or too high filtering strength is detrimental to the performance of wyf in the filter calculation loop the vector of state variables is set as 30 x k z 1 g k z 2 g k d g k z 1 f k z 2 f k d f k t in addition to the heading state information of the float and the glider the state variables also contain the forward correction step size d g k and d f k in the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr wyf makes online corrections to d g k and d f k based on the observed heading of the float and the glider the input vector of the system u k is set as 31 u k 0 f h f k 0 0 f h g k 0 t the observable output vector of the system y k is set as 32 y k z 1 g k z 1 f k t combining eq 27 and eq 29 the wdr yawing response state space equation is 33 z 1 f k 1 z 1 f k h z 2 f k h d f k f h f k z 2 f k 1 z 2 f k h f h f k d f k 1 d f k z 1 g k 1 z 1 g k h z 2 f k h d g k f h g k z 2 f k 1 z 2 f k h f h g k d g k 1 d g k the jacobian matrix of the state transition function is 34 f 1 h h f h f k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 h h f h g k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 the jacobian matrix of the observation function is 35 h 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 then based on the ekf framework in section 3 1 the state variables can be modified online and the multibody heading information of wdr can be estimated the following operations are performed at each step 1 one step prediction of the vector of state variables according to eq 33 36 x k 1 k f x k u k 2 one step prediction of covariance matrix 37 p k 1 k f k 1 k p k f k 1 k t q 3 calculate the filter gain matrix 38 k k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t h k 1 p k 1 k h k 1 t r 1 4 upstate the vector of state variables and the

framework the state space equation in wyf is established online based on the output data of wdr yawing system which makes wyf independent of the precise mechanism model of the control system this is different from the traditional ekf that relies on the wdr yawing dynamic mechanism model in section 3 1 therefore wyf has good adaptability and robustness under the unknown wdr model perturbation which will be verified in the simulation and sea trial results in the next section the dynamic mechanism model used in traditional ekf can be used for motion mechanism analysis motion prediction etc while the state space equation established by using the output data of yawing system in wyf can only be used to estimate the heading information of wdr 4 simulation and sea trial results in order to compare the performance of basic wdr yawing ekf td and the proposed wyf in the estimation of multibody heading information of wdr numerical simulation experiments and sea trial were carried out the parameters of wdr yawing response model are shown in table 3 the maximum angle of the rudder on the glider was 30 corresponding to the maximum lift of 1 5 n to simplify the calculation it was assumed that the lift varies linearly with respect to the rudder angle 4 1 simulation under precise model the iteration step size of the simulation program was set to 0 1s the initial headings and angular velocities of the float and the glider were set to 0 the measurement noise of two heading sensors obeyed gaussian distribution n 0 5 for the td of the float and the glider r g and r f were all set to 3 h 0 g and h 0 f were all set to 2 in the proposed wyf r 0 f and r 0 g were set to 2 5 c f and c g were set to 0 1 h 0 f and h 0 g were set to 2 the initial value of the vector of the state variable was set as 42 x 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t the rudder angle changed as follows 43 δ t 20 sin 0 1 t the root mean square rms is defined as follows to describe the filtering effect 44 r m s 1 t k 1 t ψ k ψ r e a l k 2 where ψ k is the estimated heading and ψ r e a l k is the actual heading at the k th moment the simulation results are shown in figs 4 9 and table 4 from figs 4 7 ekf td and wyf all could effectively reduce the noise of heading sensors and accurately estimate the actual heading of the float and the glider under precise model the output results of ekf and td were smoother while wyf was more affected by noise and the output results of wyf fluctuated slightly around the actual value but overall the smoothing effect of wyf was also satisfactory ekf and wyf tracked the multibody heading information of wdr quickly while the heading of the float and the glider estimated by td lagged behind the actual values from figs 8 and 9 the forward correction step sizes d f and d g both quickly rose to around 4 after about 10 s and then fluctuated in a small range finally d f was stable at about 4 1 and d g was stable at about 4 27 this indicated that the proposed dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr could keep a stable tracking speed through the adaptive adjustment of r g and r f from table 4 although all the three filters could effectively smooth the data of the heading sensors there were lags between the heading of the float and the glider estimated by td and the actual heading values resulting in large differences between the output results of td and the actual heading values at each sampling step therefore compared with the rms values of the heading sensors the rmss values of td were larger the rms values of ekf and wyf were less than the rms values of heading sensors which means that ekf and wyf achieved satisfactory results in tracking speed and noise reduction ability in general under precise wdr yawing model the performance of the three filters was ekf wyf td 4 2 simulation under perturbed model when wdr is sailing in the actual marine environment the hydrodynamic coefficients of the wdr yawing response model are not constants that can be accurately determined and predicted there are many reasons for this such as the attack of waves the change of the attitude of the hydrofoils the change of the draft of the float and so on therefore under actual conditions the wdr yawing response model is usually accompanied by continuous and random perturbation investigating the performance of the filter under the perturbed model is of great value to its practical application in the wdr yawing response model in this section n r r f and n r r g were set as follows 45 n r r f 200 100 rand 1 46 n r r g 120 100 rand 1 the initial state of wdr the change rule of rudder angle and filter parameters were the same as those in section 4 1 the simulation results are shown in figs 10 15 and table 5 remark n r r f and n r r g in eq 45 and eq 46 only referred to the hydrodynamic coefficients in the wdr yawing response model eq 4 while in ekf n r r f and n r r g in the jacobian matrix of the state transition function eq 16 were the same as those in section 4 1 that is n r r f 200 and n r r f 120 from figs 10 13 when the model parameters were perturbed ekf could smooth the sensor data successfully but the heading of the float and the glider estimated by ekf could not track the actual heading values the perturbation of the model had a great influence on the estimation accuracy of ekf in contrast the filtering capabilities of td and wyf were not sensitive to model perturbation and could keep stable filtering effects compared with td wyf could track the actual multibody heading information more quickly but the smoothness of the outputs was slightly less than that of td from figs 14 and 15 the rise time of d f was about 10s after a period of small adjustments d f finally was stable at about 4 15 the rise time of d g was about 18s and d g finally stabilized at about 4 35 the simulation results showed that the proposed dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr still kept stable tracking speed and had excellent robustness under perturbed model from table 5 the proposed wyf not only effectively suppressed the noise of sensor data but also had fast tracking speed therefore compared with the rms values of heading sensors the rms values of wyf were reduced the rms values of ekf and td were greater than the rms values of heading sensors but they were caused by different reasons ekf method cannot accurately estimate the actual heading of the float and the glider under model perturbation while the rms values of td were large due to the lags of the output results in a word the performance of the three filters was wyf td ekf when the model parameters of wdr were randomly perturbed 4 3 sea trial results in order to verify the filtering effect of the proposed wyf algorithm sea trials were carried out in qingdao china with the ocean ramblerⅱ wdr as the experimental platform as shown in fig 16 two magnetic compasses were used to measure the heading of the float and the glider the two circles in fig 17 were the installation positions of the two magnetic compasses the period of the wdr control system was 1s both r 0 f and r 0 g were set to 0 01 in the wyf algorithm all other parameters of the three filters were the same as those in section 4 1 the sea trial results are shown in figs 18 21 from figs 18 21 under the disturbance of the complex marine environment such as wave attack the heading of the float and the glider estimated by ekf were quite different from the headings measured by the sensors obviously the model perturbation caused by the marine environment had a great impact on the estimation accuracy of ekf for td it still maintained a good and stable filtering effect under real sea conditions the outputs of td were very smooth however due to the lag effect of td on the one hand it was unable for td to estimate the multibody heading information of wdr in time on the other hand when the heading changes sharply in the reverse direction it was easy for td to lose some data for example at around the 95th second in fig 18 the heading of the float increased continuously at first then reached the maximum heading of 53 at the 95th second and then decreased continuously due to the lag between the output and the input of td the input of td had dropped before the output reached 53 which caused the output to drop accordingly and thus part of the heading information was lost wyf could track the multibody heading information measured by sensors in time under the disturbance of the complex marine environment meanwhile wyf could effectively smooth the sawtooth in the data while reflecting the heading changes as much as possible compared with ekf and td the filtering effect of wyf was improved effectively the sea trial results showed that wyf was of excellent practical value in estimating the multibody heading information of wdr 5 conclusions in this paper the wyf algorithm was proposed to estimate the multibody heading information of wdr under the influence of noise and uncertain model perturbation wyf did not rely on the accurate dynamic model of wdr but only extracted system information from the output data of yawing system the generalized rudder angles of the float and the glider were fitted by td with adaptive tracking speed and the dynamic adaptive yawing response model of wdr with delay compensation was proposed to describe the state transition equation of the yawing system based on the ekf framework the estimation of the heading of the float and the glider and the update of the adaptive yawing response model were realized at the same time simulation experiments and sea trials were carried out and the multibody heading estimation results of ekf td and wyf were compared the results showed that the proposed wyf had excellent tracking speed and could effectively suppress the noise of sensor data in addition wyf could accurately estimate the multibody heading information of wdr under both precise model and perturbed model credit authorship
