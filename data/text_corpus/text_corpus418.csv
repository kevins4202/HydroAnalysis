2090,reservoirs have been built worldwide to address the water related issues to fully understand their potential impacts on the hydrologic regime explicitly parameterizing reservoir operation in hydrologic models is often required in this study two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on extreme gradient boosting xgboost and artificial neural network ann are respectively developed to predict the reservoir release and storage in hydrologic models for reservoirs with historic in situ inflow storage release data then a hybrid modelling framework is proposed by coupling a high resolution 3 km hydrologic model with 1 the developed data driven reservoir operation schemes and 2 a calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme designed for data scarce reservoirs this allows quantitative assessment of the cumulative impacts of dam operation on the hydrologic regime under different reservoir data availability the framework is applied to the upper yangtze river basin uyrb in china that is one of the most regulated river basins across the country due to extensive reservoir construction results indicate that both data driven reservoir operation schemes can well reconstruct the reservoir releases and storage in the uyrb daily nse of 0 9 and the xgboost performs slightly better than ann by coupling reservoir operation the model shows a remarkably improved performance in reconstructing the daily streamflow of the basin the major reservoirs in the uyrb can redistribute excessive water in the wet season to the dry season and attenuate the high and low flows leading to enhanced water security along the river our approach provides a practical framework for reservoir impact assessment and predictions keywords reservoir operation xgboost artificial neural network data driven streamflow hydrologic modelling data availability the reservoir operation data is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7190469 with the consent of the corresponding author 1 introduction for the past few decades the increasing need for water resources has continued to pose threats to achieving the sustainable development goal of the united nations in the context of population growth and climate warming o neill et al 2017 liu et al 2017 it has been reported by the united nations that over 20 of the global population are expected to be living in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2030 gain et al 2016 wada et al 2016 omer et al 2020 to alleviate the water shortage at local regional and national levels planning and construction of water infrastructures for example man made dams is one of the most practical strategies which has been continuously adopted by decision makers by far the global reservoir capacity has exceeded 8 000 km3 equivalent to one sixth of the river discharge to oceans boulange et al 2021 hydrologic models with varying degree of complexity of anthropogenic disturbance representations have been employed for assessing the planned and existing water infrastructures on alternations of hydrologic regimes redistributions of water resources and modifications of biodiversity and ecological services wada et al 2011 2017 veldkamp et al 2018 voisin et al 2013 these often include parameterization of dam operation water withdrawal irrigation and other human activities at basin scales zhao et al 2016 räsänen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 national scales shin et al 2019 and global scales wisser et al 2010 wada et al 2016 hanasaki et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2018 efforts in further extending hydrologic models have been made in such as coupling hydrological processes with thermo dynamical processes at the land surface clark et al 2021 and coupling human impacts with surface water hydrodynamics shin et al 2019 and groundwater hydrodynamics wei et al 2021 recently fleischmann et al 2021 coupled a hydrodynamic model with a hydrologic model for describing the river reservoir floodplain continuum moreover numerous modeling studies about climate change impact have proposed alternative adaptation measures of reservoir operation and planning for mitigating risks of such as floods and irrigation failures for basins in different climate region ehsani et al 2017 arheimer et al 2017 boulange et al 2021 in addition hydrologic models with reservoir operation have been further developed to address reservoir related water issues for example hydroelectric power generation grill et al 2014 giuliani et al 2016 arheimer et al 2017 hoang et al 2019 for instance wan et al 2021 developed a hydroelectricity production hp model and reproduced the global hydropower production trend and its seasonal and interannual variability for the period 1975 2016 such offline integration between outputs of hydrologic models and parameterizations of hydropower production has been adapted for studying for example impacts of droughts on hydroelectricity production at regional scales for example the variable infiltration capacity vic model with an off line reservoir operation scheme have been employed by zhao et al 2021 and zhong et al 2020 to investigate the sensitivity of the potential hydropower generation of the upper yangtze river basin to different climate warming scenarios with the focus on representations of reservoir operation in hydrologic models two kinds of approaches are commonly employed one is the data driven reservoir operation scheme that learns the relationship between inflow release and storage through the training of data driven models against a large amount of data for example coerver et al 2018 demonstrates the capability of neural network nn based fuzzy rules to derive the reservoir operation rules and the reservoir release similarly ehsani et al 2016 employed the nn model to describe the function between reservoir release and achieved satisfactory reservoir operation simulations of 17 reservoirs recently yang et al 2019 combined two recurrent neural networks namely nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input narx and long short term memory lstm model with a distributed hydrologic model to forecast the reservoir release and downstream streamflow in a real case application while these data driven models show promising results they require sufficient historic reservoir operation data inflow release storage etc for model training which may not be available at large scales and limits the applicability of these models akter and babel 2012 lu et al 2021 to minimize the data requirement conceptual reservoir operation schemes have also been developed and used which generally establishes empirical reservoir operation functions hoang et al 2019 yassin et al 2019 for example dong et al 2022 recently proposed a conceptual operation scheme for ungauged reservoirs and achieved satisfactory results for china s largest reservoirs despite the progress made by the existing literature there are a few open issues that deserve further investigation for example there lacks a well established hydrologic modelling framework to the quantify the cumulative impacts of a reservoir group with distinct data availability also the potential of different data driven approaches in capturing the behavior of china s reservoirs has not been well investigated to this end the aims of this study are 1 to develop data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann algorithms to predict the reservoir release and storage in the hydrologic models for data rich reservoirs 2 to establish a hybrid hydrologic modelling framework with the joint use of data driven and conceptual reservoir operation schemes under different reservoir data availability 3 to quantify the cumulative impacts of reservoir operation on the hydrologic regime in this study we choose the upper yangtze river basin uyrb in china as our target region our choice here is because 1 the uyrb is part of the longest river in asia namely the yangtze river and changes in water resources of the uyrb can affect water resources in downstream regions of asia gu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 and 2 several largest dams of china have been built in this region to alleviate the water and energy shortage of the country making the uyrb an ideal area for reservoir impact simulations and assessment 2 methodology 2 1 data driven reservoir operation scheme for data rich reservoirs 2 1 1 extreme gradient boosting xgboost decision trees xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 is an implementation of the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt proposed by friedman 2001 which is currently one of the fastest and best integrated decision tree algorithms the algorithm utilizes the cart as the base learner the result is jointly determined by multiple correlated decision trees as the input sample of the next decision tree will be related to the results of the previous decision tree specifically xgboost presents a new loss function with regularization which can efficiently use sparse data without overfitting compared with traditional gbdt zhan et al 2023 xgboost is a highly flexible and versatile tool that can solve most regressions and classifications as well as user created objective functions in this study six booster hyperparameters namely the learning rate the number of decision trees the maximum depth of a tree the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child the fraction of observations to be randomly samples for each tree the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree are selected to be automatically optimized through the bayesian optimization bo approach bo is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black box functions that does not assume any functional forms and have been widely used in hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models a fivefold cross validation is performed during the training process to reduce the risk of overfitting 2 1 2 artificial neural network ann ann is a widely used machine learning model formulated in an interconnected node structure haykin 1998 typically an ann consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer in this study an ordinary simple ann architecture consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer with rectified linear unit relu activation function is employed two hyperparameters namely the number of nodes in the hidden layer and the regularization term strength are selected to be automatically optimized through the bo approach a fivefold cross validation is performed during the training process to reduce the risk of overfitting 2 1 3 development of data driven reservoir operation schemes in this section we aim to develop two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann respectively to predict the reservoir releases and storage in hydrologic models at the daily scale when driven by the reservoir inflow in reality reservoir operation is often guided by prescribed reservoir operation rules that can be illustrated by a set of reservoir operation curves in a reservoir operation chart when the current storage rises above an operation curve the release tends to increase preventing the storage overfilling at an inappropriate time and vice versa dong et al 2022 2023 this relates the reservoir release to the current water storage v and the month of the year m the reservoir release is also related to the inflow i through the water balance for large important reservoirs the release decision can also be guided by inflow forecasts in the future thus considering the inflow at the next timestep in the reservoir operation simulations is reasonable in addition we consider the reservoir releases q at previous timesteps also indicative of current reservoir release this is because the reservoir release is temporarily autocorrelated as the operation of reservoir sluices and floodgates are continuous in time given the above consideration we create the input dataset of the xgboost ann regression model as an inflow vector namely i t 1 i t i t 1 a release vector namely q t 1 q t 2 storage v t and month m t with t representing the current timestep the predictand q t is the reservoir release at the current time in our study a daily timestep is adopted the xgboost ann regression model can then be expressed as q t f i t 1 i t i t 1 v t q t 1 q t 2 m t where f represents the reservoir operation function which can be learnt by the xgboost ann algorithms then the xgboost and ann models are respectively trained using the historical inflow release storage and month data the respective xgboost ann model is the core of our proposed reservoir operation scheme the simulation workflow is designed as a closed loop form which is presented in fig 1 and is elaborated as follows 1 standardize the data all of the data are standardized in the following form q q 86400 v f i i 86400 v f v v 1 v f m m 1 12 where the superscript denotes standardization v f is the upper water level of the flood control storage 86 400 is the total seconds of a day 2 predict with the trained xgboost ann regression model the predictors are input in the trained xgboost ann model to generate the predictand i e the reservoir release at the current day q t 3 update the reservoir storage the reservoir storage at the current timestep is updated from the predicted reservoir release and the current inflow through the water balance equation 4 correct the predicted release and storage additional storage constraints are imposed on the reservoir operation scheme to avoid unrealistic storage conditions the updated storage in step 3 should be neither larger than v f the upper water level of the flood control storage nor smaller than v d the upper level of the inactive storage therefore if such constraints are violated in step 3 the release is recalculated so that the storage constraints are met 5 take the predicted release and storage as the predictors in the next timestep the predicted release and storage at the current step recurrently serve as the input of the xgboost ann regression model in the next step until the simulation reaches the last step 2 2 a calibration free conceptual operation scheme for data scarce reservoirs a calibration free conceptual operation scheme dong et al 2022 2023 is employed to estimate the release and storage variation of reservoirs with no historic operation data the release of reservoirs q t is calculated as follows q t min q min v t δ t v t v d max q min r u t v d v t v c r u t q s r u t v t v c v f v c k v c v t v f max q s v t v f δ t v t v f where v t v d v c and v f are the water storage of reservoirs at the model time step t at the dead level conservation level and high flood level respectively q min is the minimum release r is time varying parameter to reflect the storage condition u t is the human water demand at the model time step t q s is the maximum acceptable release for flood control purposes k k 1 is a flood indicator equal to the ratio of q s to the inflow in this scheme parameters such as q min q s u t and r need to be determined specifically q min and q s are estimated as the 10th and 99th percentile of non exceedance probabilities of simulated streamflow in the local grid cell respectively the parameter r is determined at a monthly scale based on the difference between the current storage and the target storage v tar a time dependent storage level often prescribed in the operation rules or expected in the actual reservoir operation neitsch et al 2011 here v tar is empirically derived from linear interpolation between v cd at the beginning of dry season and v d at the beginning of wet season r at the time t is expressed as r t 1 c v t v tar v cd v d with c min i a 3 v cd v d 1 where v cd is the water storage at the dry season conservation level i e the maximum normal operating level v tar is the target storage i a is the mean annual inflow the human water demand of reservoirs u t is determined according to the designed functionality of reservoirs and the monthly water demand of the area more details on the determination of u t and on the reservoir operation scheme is provided in dong et al 2022 2023 2 3 high resolution coupled land surface hydrologic modelling in this study we employ the clhms model as the base model for hydrologic simulation which couples a land surface scheme and surface and subsurface water routing dong et al 2022 2023 the land surface scheme lsx consists primarily of a six layer soil module a two layer vegetation module a two layer snow module and a glacier icesheet module and is capable of solving the water and energy balance in the snow vegetation soil continuum and on the glacier areas thus providing the the source terms of runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration for the diffusion wave equation for surface routing and the 2 d boussinesq equation for groundwater routing at a raster grid basis yang 2009 yang et al 2010 2012 2013 wagner et al 2016 the model runs at a spatial resolution of 3 km and a 1 hour timestep the meteorological data needed to drive the clhms consist of the cn05 1 dataset for precipitation and the ncep ncar reanalysis data for temperature wind speed radiation pressure and humidity the cn05 1 dataset published by china meteorological administration is a 0 25 0 25 gridded precipitation dataset interpolated from the observed precipitation of 2 400 rain gauges nationwide the specific yield of aquifer and the aquifer thickness required for the groundwater module is collected from the china national geologic survey dataset from the national earth system science data center 3 case study of the upper yangtze river basin 3 1 study area the upper yangtze river basin uyrb refers to the basin above the yichang hydrologic station in the mainstream yangtze river and has a drainage area of 1 0 million km2 accounting for about 12 of china s total land area the basin is mostly dominated by subtropical and temperate climate and is strongly influenced by the east asia monsoon the mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm with strong seasonal variability and about 75 of the precipitation occur between may and september the uyrb is a major economic agricultural and industrial hub of china and currently accounts for about one six of the country s population and gross domestic product to alleviate the water and energy shortage across the area a large number of reservoirs have been continuously built since late 1990 s as of 2020 there have been more than ten thousand reservoirs over the basin with a total capacity of around 130 km3 reservoirs can significantly disrupt the natural hydrologic processes of the basin and bring a challenge to the sustainable management of the basin major hydrologic stations of the basin include shigu ertan gaochang pingshan wulong beibei cuntan and yichang fig 2 3 2 reservoir information and operation data while there are a large number of reservoirs in the uyrb most of them are either with a small capacity or unable to regulate the streamflow beyond daily scales thus having a trivial impact on the streamflow of downstream areas as shown in fig 2 we identify and incorporate a total of 10 reservoirs in our study that 1 have a capacity larger than 1 km3 and 2 have a considerable ability to regulate the local streamflow at the monthly scale namely three gorges xiluodu jinping i goupitan ertan pubugou tingzikou baozhusi zipingpu and changheba these 10 reservoirs have a total capacity of 92 km3 accounting for nearly 3 4 of the combined capacity of all operational reservoirs in the uyrb as of 2019 we collect the daily in situ inflow storage and release of three gorges xiluodu jinping i and ertan which are then fed into the data driven reservoir operation scheme for training testing and predicting table 1 the combined capacity of these 4 reservoirs accounts for nearly 80 of the total capacity of the 10 reservoirs for other reservoirs no in situ reservoir operation data is available and the release of these reservoirs are simulated with the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme 3 3 streamflow data in this study the daily in situ streamflow data at the shigu ertan gaochang pingshan wulong beibei and cuntan stations fig 2 during 1961 1995 are collected the daily in situ streamflow data at the yichang station during 1961 2020 are collected these data are used for calibration and validation of the hydrologic model 3 4 experimental design to understand the impact of reservoir operation on the hydrologic regime of the uyrb we set up three simulation scenarios namely natural flow actual reservoirs and all reservoir a 10 year simulation for the historic period of 2011 2020 is conducted for each scenario this period is selected because most of the reservoirs were put into operation around 2010 natural flow scenario this scenario refers to hydrologic simulations with no account of reservoirs to represent the natural flow regimes of the uyrb actual reservoirs scenario this scenario refers to hydrologic simulations taking account of reservoir operation according to the operation date of each reservoir i e a reservoir is not activated during a model simulation until the simulation reaches the time point where that reservoir was completed in the real world this scenario is set to represent the actual streamflow regime of the uyrb which is then compared with the natural flow scenario to manifest the improvement of model performance by taking account of the reservoirs in the hydrologic simulations all reservoirs scenario this scenario refers to hydrologic simulations taking account of the operation of all 10 reservoirs this scenario represents the flow regimes of the uyrb under the full impact of reservoirs which is then compared with the natural flow scenario to quantify the impact of reservoir operation on the streamflow regime of the uyrb in the actual reservoirs scenario and the all reservoirs scenario the reservoir operation is represented by the xgboost based data driven reservoir operation scheme for the three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir this selection is based on the evaluation results in section 4 1 for the other 6 reservoirs the reservoir operation is represented by the conceptual reservoir operation scheme 4 results 4 1 reservoir operation simulations with data driven reservoir operation scheme to accurately depict the hydrological impact of reservoirs we train cross validate and test the two data driven reservoir operation schemes section 2 1 for the three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir using the historic in situ reservoir operation data the training period and the testing period for each reservoir are same for xgboost and ann which are shown in fig 3 fig 3 depicts the daily observed and simulated release and storage of the four reservoirs respectively in general the accuracy of the release and storage simulation is rather satisfactory for both xgboost and ann based reservoir operation schemes for the xgboost based scheme the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of simulated storage of three gorges reservoir are 0 96 0 96 over the training testing period and the daily nse values of simulated release are 0 92 0 93 over the training testing period table 2 the daily nse values of simulated storage of xiluodu reservoir are 0 90 0 88 over the training testing period and the daily nse values of simulated release are 0 93 0 91 over the training testing period these results are similar for the other two reservoirs as the daily nse values of simulated storage release over the training and testing periods are all above 0 90 0 85 table 2 for the ann based scheme the accuracy is slightly lower than the xgboost based scheme for example the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of simulated storage of three gorges reservoir are 0 93 0 90 over the training testing period and the daily nse values of simulated release are 0 88 0 84 over the training testing period in general our results suggest that both of the developed data driven reservoir operation schemes are able to accurately represent the operation of the investigated four reservoirs due to the relatively better accuracy the xgboost based scheme is selected to simulate the reservoir operation in the following sections 4 2 reservoir operation simulations with calibration free conceptual operation scheme the operation of other reservoirs on the other hand are all represented by the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme section 2 2 to assess the validity of the calibration free operation scheme in simulating the operation of no data reservoirs here we drive this scheme with the in situ inflow of three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir and apply this scheme to each of these reservoirs for evaluation note that the in situ reservoir release and storage are not used for calibration but for evaluation only fig 4 shows the simulated water storage and release of the four reservoirs respectively for these reservoirs the conceptual reservoir operation scheme can generally well capture the variation of water storages with the daily nse values of water storage ranging from 0 72 to 0 80 table 2 this is similar for the reservoir release as the daily nse values ranges from around 0 7 to 0 9 for these reservoirs these results highlight the applicability of the conceptual operation scheme in ungauged reservoir simulations suggesting that the employed conceptual operation scheme can serve as a reliable tool to simulate the reservoir operation process without historic operation records for reservoir impact assessment in ungauged basins 4 3 improved hydrologic simulations considering reservoir operation to reproduce the natural flow regime of the uyrb the hydrologic model with no account of reservoirs is calibrated against the daily streamflow of shigu ertan gaochang pingshan wulong beibei cuntan and yichang for the period of 1961 1985 and is validated for the period of 1986 1995 the calibration and validation periods are selected as such since most of the reservoirs upstream of the stations were put into operation only after 1995 fig 5 presents the calibration and validation results with the daily nse values it shows that the performance of the hydrologic model with no account of reservoirs is quite satisfactory with most of the daily nse values over 0 9 in the mainstream and over 0 7 in the tributaries this result indicates that our model is able to well depict the natural hydrologic processes of the uyrb after the model calibration and validation we continue the simulations to the period of 2011 2020 notably the streamflow simulated by the hydrologic model without reservoirs shows a daily nse of 0 64 during 2011 2020 this can possibly be explained by the fact that several large mainstream and tributary reservoirs in the uyrb were put into operation in the past decades yet the hydrologic simulation without reservoirs is unable to account for the impact of reservoirs on the streamflow during this period to confirm if the lack of reservoir operation is the major cause of the degraded model accuracy during this period we perform a hydrologic simulation in which the reservoir operation is represented by the xgboost based data driven reservoir operation scheme for the three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir and by the conceptual reservoir operation scheme for other 6 reservoirs fig 6 depicts the daily streamflow simulations under natural flow scenario orange and the actual reservoirs scenario blue compared with observations black in general we find that integrating reservoirs in the hydrologic model can improve the model performance in the streamflow simulation during 2011 2020 as the daily nse at yichang is significantly enhanced from 0 64 to 0 90 during this period this indicates that the reservoir represented clhms model allows accurately quantifying the hydrological impact of reservoirs 4 4 impact of reservoir operation on the flow regime fig 7 depicts the monthly streamflow at the yichang station and its differences under the natural flow and the all reservoirs scenarios respectively for the all reservoirs scenario reservoirs are found able to significantly decrease the seasonal flow variability as the average streamflow is decreased from by 3150 m3 s 13 for the wet season june to october and increased by 2214 m3 s 32 for the dry season november to may reservoirs can also reduce the interannual variations of monthly streamflow and the monthly streamflow interval between the 90 and 10 percentile averaged over a year is reduced from 5980 m3 s to 4880 m3 s in particular the streamflow during the wet season is more stabilized over a multi year period with the 10 90 interval reduced from 10920 m3 s to 9520 m3 s to further investigate the impact of reservoir operation on the hydrologic extremes of the uyrb the multi year averaged maximum minimum 1 day max1 min1 3 day max3 min3 7 day max7 min7 30 day max30 min30 and 90 day max90 min90 streamflow simulated by the hydrologic model are compared between the all reservoirs scenario and the natural flow scenario at the yichang station fig 7b depicts the variations of extreme hydrologic indicators induced by reservoirs it is noted that reservoir operation can reduce the flood magnitudes by reducing the multi year averaged maximum 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day streamflow by 21 19 14 9 and 9 respectively similarly reservoir operation can significantly alleviate the drought condition by increasing the multi year averaged minimum 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day streamflow by 101 101 100 91 and 79 respectively fig 8 a depicts the multi year averaged simulated natural streamflow of the uyrb at the 3 km resolution fig 8b and 8c depicts the relative difference of the simulated dry season and wet season streamflow between the all reservoirs scenario and the natural flow scenario it can be seen that tributary reservoirs can greatly impact the streamflow at local scales for example the jinping i reservoir can reduce the streamflow in the wet season by 11 fig 8c while increasing the streamflow in the dry season by over 40 fig 8b due to the lateral flow downstream of the dam the impact of individual tributary reservoirs diminishes towards downstream areas yet their cumulative effect can still stretch further downstream to the mainstream the mainstream reservoirs can have a cumulative prominent effect on the downstream streamflow along the mainstream especially for the xiluodu reservoir which releases 6 less water during the wet season but releases 13 more water during the dry season compared with the inflow for the most downstream reservoir of the uyrb i e three gorges reservoir the reservoir release is 2215 m3 s 32 higher in the dry season and 3150 m3 s 13 lower in the wet season under the all reservoirs scenario than the natural flow scenario 5 discussion 5 1 prospects and possible limitations of data driven reservoir operation simulations as an estimated 2 8 million reservoirs have been constructed globally recent research efforts in improving the representations of reservoir operation in hydrologic models are flourishing veldkamp et al 2018 turner et al 2020 boulange et al 2021 as a powerful ensemble learning algorithm the xgboost has been one of the most popular machine learning methods to overcome difficulties in a variety of earth system modelling applications in this study we developed two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann respectively to predict the reservoir release and storage in the hydrologic models in general both algorithms exhibit satisfactory results in modelling reservoir operation based on historic in situ reservoir operation data in particular compared with the ann based scheme the xgboost based scheme shows a slightly better predicting accuracy of reservoir releases and storages daily nse around 0 9 for all of the reservoirs which is comparable to those reported by other studies ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 this implies that xgboost can be applicable in hydrologic simulations and predictions in reservoir regulated basins the proposed hybrid hydrologic modelling framework also has the potential for improving real time streamflow forecasting for example hydrologic models can be driven by future meteorologic forecast to generate future reservoir inflow forecasts yang et al 2019 the inflow can then be input to the data driven and conceptual reservoir operation schemes to predict the future reservoir releases allowing the information of inflow forecasts to be reasonably transferred downstream an issue associated with the data driven reservoir model is its fundamentally black box nature which may be subject to a degraded performance in extrapolation beyond the training data to alleviate this problem several storage constraints are applied to the machine learning algorithms in this study forming up a physics informed data driven approach if the calculated storage fails to meet the constraints the predicted release in this step is recalculated via the reservoir water balance equation fig 1 this approach is similar to that adopted by gangrade et al 2022 who used a few empirical equations to constrain the predicted results of their proposed long short term memory model lstm based reservoir operation scheme however it is also worth noting that the simulation accuracy reported in their study is somewhat lower than those reported in the existing literature which could be due to the exclusion of reservoir release in the predictors of the regression model this suggests that inclusion of reservoir release in a closed loop form may help achieve more accurate predictions with data driven reservoir operation schemes 5 2 possible future directions of data driven reservoir operation simulations often the lack of reservoir operation data limits the use of machine learning in reservoir modelling leaving the conceptual reservoir operation scheme the only choice in hydrologic models as in our hybrid modelling framework however we believe there is room for improvement of machine learning approaches with respect to ungauged reservoirs notably recent studies have attempted to employ the lstm model to predict streamflow in ungauged basins arsenault et al 2023 kratzert et al 2019 this was done by 1 training the machine learning model using the long term meteorological data and static features of the basin as predictors and streamflow as the predictand for a large number of basins usually greater than 100 and 2 testing the model in other basins that are in the test samples which are a proxy for ungauged basins by doing so both arsenault et al 2023 kratzert et al 2019 have reported superior accuracies of lstm model in simulating the streamflow in these test basins over the traditional hydrologic model even if the traditional models are well calibrated in these basins such an idea could be transferrable to operation simulations of reservoirs without historic operation data this will be one of our future research directions 6 conclusions in this study two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann are developed to predict the reservoir release in hydrologic models for reservoirs with historic operation data then a hybrid hydrologic modelling framework is proposed by using the data driven reservoir operation scheme in a high resolution 3 km hydrologic model together with a calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme designed for data scarce reservoirs this allows quantitative assessment of the cumulative impacts of dam operation on the hydrologic regime under different reservoir data availability as a test application the proposed hybrid modelling framework is applied to the upper yangtze river basin where ten major operational reservoirs are taken into consideration i e three gorges xiluodu jinping i goupitan ertan pubugou tingzikou baozhusi zipingpu and changheba by comparing with the in situ reservoir releases and storage we show that both of the developed xgboost and ann based reservoir operation schemes trained from the historic in situ reservoir operation data i e inflow release storage can accurately reconstruct the reservoir releases and storage considered in our study the xgboost generally shows a slightly superior accuracy over ann with all of the daily nse values of simulated releases and storage are over 0 85 the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme despite exhibiting a lower simulation accuracy can generally capture the release and storage variations of the major reservoirs in the uyrb which suggests this scheme can be used for simulations of reservoirs without reservoir operation data by coupling the xgboost based reservoir operation scheme and the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme with the hydrologic model the model shows a remarkably improved performance in reconstructing the historic streamflow at the yichang station i e the outlet of uyrb on its basis four sets of 10 year 2011 2020 simulations with a spatial resolution of 3 km are conducted to analyze the likely streamflow variations under the cumulative impacts of the operation of 10 major reservoirs in the uyrb simulation results show that the mainstream and tributary reservoirs have a notable cumulative impact on the hydrologic regime at the local scale and the regional scale by redistributing the excessive water resources in the wet season to the dry season leading to an improved level of water security especially along the mainstream reservoirs also attenuate the high flows and low flows along the river with the maximum 1 day to 90 day streamflow reducing by 9 21 and the minimum 1 day to 90 day streamflow increasing by 79 101 respectively this study proposes a hybrid hydrologic modelling framework with the combined use of data driven and conceptual reservoir operation schemes that can be applicable worldwide future research directions include the development of a generalized data driven reservoir operation modelling

predict the reservoir release and storage in hydrologic models for reservoirs with historic in situ inflow storage release data then a hybrid modelling framework is proposed by coupling a high resolution 3 km hydrologic model with 1 the developed data driven reservoir operation schemes and 2 a calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme designed for data scarce reservoirs this allows quantitative assessment of the cumulative impacts of dam operation on the hydrologic regime under different reservoir data availability the framework is applied to the upper yangtze river basin uyrb in china that is one of the most regulated river basins across the country due to extensive reservoir construction results indicate that both data driven reservoir operation schemes can well reconstruct the reservoir releases and storage in the uyrb daily nse of 0 9 and the xgboost performs slightly better than ann by coupling reservoir operation the model shows a remarkably improved performance in reconstructing the daily streamflow of the basin the major reservoirs in the uyrb can redistribute excessive water in the wet season to the dry season and attenuate the high and low flows leading to enhanced water security along the river our approach provides a practical framework for reservoir impact assessment and predictions keywords reservoir operation xgboost artificial

author 1 introduction for the past few decades the increasing need for water resources has continued to pose threats to achieving the sustainable development goal of the united nations in the context of population growth and climate warming o neill et al 2017 liu et al 2017 it has been reported by the united nations that over 20 of the global population are expected to be living in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2030 gain et al 2016 wada et al 2016 omer et al 2020 to alleviate the water shortage at local regional and national levels planning and construction of water infrastructures for example man made dams is one of the most practical strategies which has been continuously adopted by decision makers by far the global reservoir capacity has exceeded 8 000 km3 equivalent to one sixth of the river discharge to oceans boulange et al 2021 hydrologic models with varying degree of complexity of anthropogenic disturbance representations have been employed for assessing the planned and existing water infrastructures on alternations of hydrologic regimes redistributions of water resources and modifications of biodiversity and ecological services wada et al 2011 2017 veldkamp et al 2018 voisin et al 2013 these often include parameterization of dam operation water withdrawal irrigation and other human activities at basin scales zhao et al 2016 räsänen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 national scales shin et al 2019 and global scales wisser et al 2010 wada et al 2016 hanasaki et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2018 efforts in further extending hydrologic models have been made in such as coupling hydrological processes with thermo dynamical processes at the land surface clark et al 2021 and coupling human impacts with surface water hydrodynamics shin et al 2019 and groundwater hydrodynamics wei et al 2021 recently fleischmann et al 2021 coupled a hydrodynamic model with a hydrologic model for describing the river reservoir floodplain continuum moreover numerous modeling studies about climate change impact have proposed alternative adaptation measures of reservoir operation and planning for mitigating risks of such as floods and irrigation failures for basins in different climate region ehsani et al 2017 arheimer et al 2017 boulange et al 2021 in addition hydrologic models with reservoir operation have been further developed to address reservoir related water issues for example hydroelectric power generation grill et al 2014 giuliani et al 2016 arheimer et al 2017 hoang et al 2019 for instance wan et al 2021 developed a hydroelectricity production hp model and reproduced the global hydropower production trend and its seasonal and interannual variability for the period 1975 2016 such offline integration between outputs of hydrologic models and parameterizations of hydropower production has been adapted for studying for example impacts of droughts on hydroelectricity production at regional scales for example the variable infiltration capacity vic model with an off line reservoir operation scheme have been employed by zhao et al 2021 and zhong et al 2020 to investigate the sensitivity of the potential hydropower generation of the upper yangtze river basin to different climate warming scenarios with the focus on representations of reservoir operation in hydrologic models two kinds of approaches are commonly employed one is the data driven reservoir operation scheme that learns the relationship between inflow release and storage through the training of data driven models against a large amount of data for example coerver et al 2018 demonstrates the capability of neural network nn based fuzzy rules to derive the reservoir operation rules and the reservoir release similarly ehsani et al 2016 employed the nn model to describe the function between reservoir release and achieved satisfactory reservoir operation simulations of 17 reservoirs recently yang et al 2019 combined two recurrent neural networks namely nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input narx and long short term memory lstm model with a distributed hydrologic model to forecast the reservoir release and downstream streamflow in a real case application while these data driven models show promising results they require sufficient historic reservoir operation data inflow release storage etc for model training which may not be available at large scales and limits the applicability of these models akter and babel 2012 lu et al 2021 to minimize the data requirement conceptual reservoir operation schemes have also been developed and used which generally establishes empirical reservoir operation functions hoang et al 2019 yassin et al 2019 for example dong et al 2022 recently proposed a conceptual operation scheme for ungauged reservoirs and achieved satisfactory results for china s largest reservoirs despite the progress made by the existing literature there are a few open issues that deserve further investigation for example there lacks a well established hydrologic modelling framework to the quantify the cumulative impacts of a reservoir group with distinct data availability also the potential of different data driven approaches in capturing the behavior of china s reservoirs has not been well investigated to this end the aims of this study are 1 to develop data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann algorithms to predict the reservoir release and storage in the hydrologic models for data rich reservoirs 2 to establish a hybrid hydrologic modelling framework with the joint use of data driven and conceptual reservoir operation schemes under different reservoir data availability 3 to quantify the cumulative impacts of reservoir operation on the hydrologic regime in this study we choose the upper yangtze river basin uyrb in china as our target region our choice here is because 1 the uyrb is part of the longest river in asia namely the yangtze river and changes in water resources of the uyrb can affect water resources in downstream regions of asia gu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 and 2 several largest dams of china have been built in this region to alleviate the water and energy shortage of the country making the uyrb an ideal area for reservoir impact simulations and assessment 2 methodology 2 1 data driven reservoir operation scheme for data rich reservoirs 2 1 1 extreme gradient boosting xgboost decision trees xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 is an implementation of the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt proposed by friedman 2001 which is currently one of the fastest and best integrated decision tree algorithms the algorithm utilizes the cart as the base learner the result is jointly determined by multiple correlated decision trees as the input sample of the next decision tree will be related to the results of the previous decision tree specifically xgboost presents a new loss function with regularization which can efficiently use sparse data without overfitting compared with traditional gbdt zhan et al 2023 xgboost is a highly flexible and versatile tool that can solve most regressions and classifications as well as user created objective functions in this study six booster hyperparameters namely the learning rate the number of decision trees the maximum depth of a tree the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child the fraction of observations to be randomly samples for each tree the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree are selected to be automatically optimized through the bayesian optimization bo approach bo is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black box functions that does not assume any functional forms and have been widely used in hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models a fivefold cross validation is performed during the training process to reduce the risk of overfitting 2 1 2 artificial neural network ann ann is a widely used machine learning model formulated in an interconnected node structure haykin 1998 typically an ann consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer in this study an ordinary simple ann architecture consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer with rectified linear unit relu activation function is employed two hyperparameters namely the number of nodes in the hidden layer and the regularization term strength are selected to be automatically optimized through the bo approach a fivefold cross validation is performed during the training process to reduce the risk of overfitting 2 1 3 development of data driven reservoir operation schemes in this section we aim to develop two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann respectively to predict the reservoir releases and storage in hydrologic models at the daily scale when driven by the reservoir inflow in reality reservoir operation is often guided by prescribed reservoir operation rules that can be illustrated by a set of reservoir operation curves in a reservoir operation chart when the current storage rises above an operation curve the release tends to increase preventing the storage overfilling at an inappropriate time and vice versa dong et al 2022 2023 this relates the reservoir release to the current water storage v and the month of the year m the reservoir release is also related to the inflow i through the water balance for large important reservoirs the release decision can also be guided by inflow forecasts in the future thus considering the inflow at the next timestep in the reservoir operation simulations is reasonable in addition we consider the reservoir releases q at previous timesteps also indicative of current reservoir release this is because the reservoir release is temporarily autocorrelated as the operation of reservoir sluices and floodgates are continuous in time given the above consideration we create the input dataset of the xgboost ann regression model as an inflow vector namely i t 1 i t i t 1 a release vector namely q t 1 q t 2 storage v t and month m t with t representing the current timestep the predictand q t is the reservoir release at the current time in our study a daily timestep is adopted the xgboost ann regression model can then be expressed as q t f i t 1 i t i t 1 v t q t 1 q t 2 m t where f represents the reservoir operation function which can be learnt by the xgboost ann algorithms then the xgboost and ann models are respectively trained using the historical inflow release storage and month data the respective xgboost ann model is the core of our proposed reservoir operation scheme the simulation workflow is designed as a closed loop form which is presented in fig 1 and is elaborated as follows 1 standardize the data all of the data are standardized in the following form q q 86400 v f i i 86400 v f v v 1 v f m m 1 12 where the superscript denotes standardization v f is the upper water level of the flood control storage 86 400 is the total seconds of a day 2 predict with the trained xgboost ann regression model the predictors are input in the trained xgboost ann model to generate the predictand i e the reservoir release at the current day q t 3 update the reservoir storage the reservoir storage at the current timestep is updated from the predicted reservoir release and the current inflow through the water balance equation 4 correct the predicted release and storage additional storage constraints are imposed on the reservoir operation scheme to avoid unrealistic storage conditions the updated storage in step 3 should be neither larger than v f the upper water level of the flood control storage nor smaller than v d the upper level of the inactive storage therefore if such constraints are violated in step 3 the release is recalculated so that the storage constraints are met 5 take the predicted release and storage as the predictors in the next timestep the predicted release and storage at the current step recurrently serve as the input of the xgboost ann regression model in the next step until the simulation reaches the last step 2 2 a calibration free conceptual operation scheme for data scarce reservoirs a calibration free conceptual operation scheme dong et al 2022 2023 is employed to estimate the release and storage variation of reservoirs with no historic operation data the release of reservoirs q t is calculated as follows q t min q min v t δ t v t v d max q min r u t v d v t v c r u t q s r u t v t v c v f v c k v c v t v f max q s v t v f δ t v t v f where v t v d v c and v f are the water storage of reservoirs at the model time step t at the dead level conservation level and high flood level respectively q min is the minimum release r is time varying parameter to reflect the storage condition u t is the human water demand at the model time step t q s is the maximum acceptable release for flood control purposes k k 1 is a flood indicator equal to the ratio of q s to the inflow in this scheme parameters such as q min q s u t and r need to be determined specifically q min and q s are estimated as the 10th and 99th percentile of non exceedance probabilities of simulated streamflow in the local grid cell respectively the parameter r is determined at a monthly scale based on the difference between the current storage and the target storage v tar a time dependent storage level often prescribed in the operation rules or expected in the actual reservoir operation neitsch et al 2011 here v tar is empirically derived from linear interpolation between v cd at the beginning of dry season and v d at the beginning of wet season r at the time t is expressed as r t 1 c v t v tar v cd v d with c min i a 3 v cd v d 1 where v cd is the water storage at the dry season conservation level i e the maximum normal operating level v tar is the target storage i a is the mean annual inflow the human water demand of reservoirs u t is determined according to the designed functionality of reservoirs and the monthly water demand of the area more details on the determination of u t and on the reservoir operation scheme is provided in dong et al 2022 2023 2 3 high resolution coupled land surface hydrologic modelling in this study we employ the clhms model as the base model for hydrologic simulation which couples a land surface scheme and surface and subsurface water routing dong et al 2022 2023 the land surface scheme lsx consists primarily of a six layer soil module a two layer vegetation module a two layer snow module and a glacier icesheet module and is capable of solving the water and energy balance in the snow vegetation soil continuum and on the glacier areas thus providing the the source terms of runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration for the diffusion wave equation for surface routing and the 2 d boussinesq equation for groundwater routing at a raster grid basis yang 2009 yang et al 2010 2012 2013 wagner et al 2016 the model runs at a spatial resolution of 3 km and a 1 hour timestep the meteorological data needed to drive the clhms consist of the cn05 1 dataset for precipitation and the ncep ncar reanalysis data for temperature wind speed radiation pressure and humidity the cn05 1 dataset published by china meteorological administration is a 0 25 0 25 gridded precipitation dataset interpolated from the observed precipitation of 2 400 rain gauges nationwide the specific yield of aquifer and the aquifer thickness required for the groundwater module is collected from the china national geologic survey dataset from the national earth system science data center 3 case study of the upper yangtze river basin 3 1 study area the upper yangtze river basin uyrb refers to the basin above the yichang hydrologic station in the mainstream yangtze river and has a drainage area of 1 0 million km2 accounting for about 12 of china s total land area the basin is mostly dominated by subtropical and temperate climate and is strongly influenced by the east asia monsoon the mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm with strong seasonal variability and about 75 of the precipitation occur between may and september the uyrb is a major economic agricultural and industrial hub of china and currently accounts for about one six of the country s population and gross domestic product to alleviate the water and energy shortage across the area a large number of reservoirs have been continuously built since late 1990 s as of 2020 there have been more than ten thousand reservoirs over the basin with a total capacity of around 130 km3 reservoirs can significantly disrupt the natural hydrologic processes of the basin and bring a challenge to the sustainable management of the basin major hydrologic stations of the basin include shigu ertan gaochang pingshan wulong beibei cuntan and yichang fig 2 3 2 reservoir information and operation data while there are a large number of reservoirs in the uyrb most of them are either with a small capacity or unable to regulate the streamflow beyond daily scales thus having a trivial impact on the streamflow of downstream areas as shown in fig 2 we identify and incorporate a total of 10 reservoirs in our study that 1 have a capacity larger than 1 km3 and 2 have a considerable ability to regulate the local streamflow at the monthly scale namely three gorges xiluodu jinping i goupitan ertan pubugou tingzikou baozhusi zipingpu and changheba these 10 reservoirs have a total capacity of 92 km3 accounting for nearly 3 4 of the combined capacity of all operational reservoirs in the uyrb as of 2019 we collect the daily in situ inflow storage and release of three gorges xiluodu jinping i and ertan which are then fed into the data driven reservoir operation scheme for training testing and predicting table 1 the combined capacity of these 4 reservoirs accounts for nearly 80 of the total capacity of the 10 reservoirs for other reservoirs no in situ reservoir operation data is available and the release of these reservoirs are simulated with the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme 3 3 streamflow data in this study the daily in situ streamflow data at the shigu ertan gaochang pingshan wulong beibei and cuntan stations fig 2 during 1961 1995 are collected the daily in situ streamflow data at the yichang station during 1961 2020 are collected these data are used for calibration and validation of the hydrologic model 3 4 experimental design to understand the impact of reservoir operation on the hydrologic regime of the uyrb we set up three simulation scenarios namely natural flow actual reservoirs and all reservoir a 10 year simulation for the historic period of 2011 2020 is conducted for each scenario this period is selected because most of the reservoirs were put into operation around 2010 natural flow scenario this scenario refers to hydrologic simulations with no account of reservoirs to represent the natural flow regimes of the uyrb actual reservoirs scenario this scenario refers to hydrologic simulations taking account of reservoir operation according to the operation date of each reservoir i e a reservoir is not activated during a model simulation until the simulation reaches the time point where that reservoir was completed in the real world this scenario is set to represent the actual streamflow regime of the uyrb which is then compared with the natural flow scenario to manifest the improvement of model performance by taking account of the reservoirs in the hydrologic simulations all reservoirs scenario this scenario refers to hydrologic simulations taking account of the operation of all 10 reservoirs this scenario represents the flow regimes of the uyrb under the full impact of reservoirs which is then compared with the natural flow scenario to quantify the impact of reservoir operation on the streamflow regime of the uyrb in the actual reservoirs scenario and the all reservoirs scenario the reservoir operation is represented by the xgboost based data driven reservoir operation scheme for the three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir this selection is based on the evaluation results in section 4 1 for the other 6 reservoirs the reservoir operation is represented by the conceptual reservoir operation scheme 4 results 4 1 reservoir operation simulations with data driven reservoir operation scheme to accurately depict the hydrological impact of reservoirs we train cross validate and test the two data driven reservoir operation schemes section 2 1 for the three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir using the historic in situ reservoir operation data the training period and the testing period for each reservoir are same for xgboost and ann which are shown in fig 3 fig 3 depicts the daily observed and simulated release and storage of the four reservoirs respectively in general the accuracy of the release and storage simulation is rather satisfactory for both xgboost and ann based reservoir operation schemes for the xgboost based scheme the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of simulated storage of three gorges reservoir are 0 96 0 96 over the training testing period and the daily nse values of simulated release are 0 92 0 93 over the training testing period table 2 the daily nse values of simulated storage of xiluodu reservoir are 0 90 0 88 over the training testing period and the daily nse values of simulated release are 0 93 0 91 over the training testing period these results are similar for the other two reservoirs as the daily nse values of simulated storage release over the training and testing periods are all above 0 90 0 85 table 2 for the ann based scheme the accuracy is slightly lower than the xgboost based scheme for example the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of simulated storage of three gorges reservoir are 0 93 0 90 over the training testing period and the daily nse values of simulated release are 0 88 0 84 over the training testing period in general our results suggest that both of the developed data driven reservoir operation schemes are able to accurately represent the operation of the investigated four reservoirs due to the relatively better accuracy the xgboost based scheme is selected to simulate the reservoir operation in the following sections 4 2 reservoir operation simulations with calibration free conceptual operation scheme the operation of other reservoirs on the other hand are all represented by the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme section 2 2 to assess the validity of the calibration free operation scheme in simulating the operation of no data reservoirs here we drive this scheme with the in situ inflow of three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir and apply this scheme to each of these reservoirs for evaluation note that the in situ reservoir release and storage are not used for calibration but for evaluation only fig 4 shows the simulated water storage and release of the four reservoirs respectively for these reservoirs the conceptual reservoir operation scheme can generally well capture the variation of water storages with the daily nse values of water storage ranging from 0 72 to 0 80 table 2 this is similar for the reservoir release as the daily nse values ranges from around 0 7 to 0 9 for these reservoirs these results highlight the applicability of the conceptual operation scheme in ungauged reservoir simulations suggesting that the employed conceptual operation scheme can serve as a reliable tool to simulate the reservoir operation process without historic operation records for reservoir impact assessment in ungauged basins 4 3 improved hydrologic simulations considering reservoir operation to reproduce the natural flow regime of the uyrb the hydrologic model with no account of reservoirs is calibrated against the daily streamflow of shigu ertan gaochang pingshan wulong beibei cuntan and yichang for the period of 1961 1985 and is validated for the period of 1986 1995 the calibration and validation periods are selected as such since most of the reservoirs upstream of the stations were put into operation only after 1995 fig 5 presents the calibration and validation results with the daily nse values it shows that the performance of the hydrologic model with no account of reservoirs is quite satisfactory with most of the daily nse values over 0 9 in the mainstream and over 0 7 in the tributaries this result indicates that our model is able to well depict the natural hydrologic processes of the uyrb after the model calibration and validation we continue the simulations to the period of 2011 2020 notably the streamflow simulated by the hydrologic model without reservoirs shows a daily nse of 0 64 during 2011 2020 this can possibly be explained by the fact that several large mainstream and tributary reservoirs in the uyrb were put into operation in the past decades yet the hydrologic simulation without reservoirs is unable to account for the impact of reservoirs on the streamflow during this period to confirm if the lack of reservoir operation is the major cause of the degraded model accuracy during this period we perform a hydrologic simulation in which the reservoir operation is represented by the xgboost based data driven reservoir operation scheme for the three gorges xiluodu ertan and jinping i reservoir and by the conceptual reservoir operation scheme for other 6 reservoirs fig 6 depicts the daily streamflow simulations under natural flow scenario orange and the actual reservoirs scenario blue compared with observations black in general we find that integrating reservoirs in the hydrologic model can improve the model performance in the streamflow simulation during 2011 2020 as the daily nse at yichang is significantly enhanced from 0 64 to 0 90 during this period this indicates that the reservoir represented clhms model allows accurately quantifying the hydrological impact of reservoirs 4 4 impact of reservoir operation on the flow regime fig 7 depicts the monthly streamflow at the yichang station and its differences under the natural flow and the all reservoirs scenarios respectively for the all reservoirs scenario reservoirs are found able to significantly decrease the seasonal flow variability as the average streamflow is decreased from by 3150 m3 s 13 for the wet season june to october and increased by 2214 m3 s 32 for the dry season november to may reservoirs can also reduce the interannual variations of monthly streamflow and the monthly streamflow interval between the 90 and 10 percentile averaged over a year is reduced from 5980 m3 s to 4880 m3 s in particular the streamflow during the wet season is more stabilized over a multi year period with the 10 90 interval reduced from 10920 m3 s to 9520 m3 s to further investigate the impact of reservoir operation on the hydrologic extremes of the uyrb the multi year averaged maximum minimum 1 day max1 min1 3 day max3 min3 7 day max7 min7 30 day max30 min30 and 90 day max90 min90 streamflow simulated by the hydrologic model are compared between the all reservoirs scenario and the natural flow scenario at the yichang station fig 7b depicts the variations of extreme hydrologic indicators induced by reservoirs it is noted that reservoir operation can reduce the flood magnitudes by reducing the multi year averaged maximum 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day streamflow by 21 19 14 9 and 9 respectively similarly reservoir operation can significantly alleviate the drought condition by increasing the multi year averaged minimum 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day streamflow by 101 101 100 91 and 79 respectively fig 8 a depicts the multi year averaged simulated natural streamflow of the uyrb at the 3 km resolution fig 8b and 8c depicts the relative difference of the simulated dry season and wet season streamflow between the all reservoirs scenario and the natural flow scenario it can be seen that tributary reservoirs can greatly impact the streamflow at local scales for example the jinping i reservoir can reduce the streamflow in the wet season by 11 fig 8c while increasing the streamflow in the dry season by over 40 fig 8b due to the lateral flow downstream of the dam the impact of individual tributary reservoirs diminishes towards downstream areas yet their cumulative effect can still stretch further downstream to the mainstream the mainstream reservoirs can have a cumulative prominent effect on the downstream streamflow along the mainstream especially for the xiluodu reservoir which releases 6 less water during the wet season but releases 13 more water during the dry season compared with the inflow for the most downstream reservoir of the uyrb i e three gorges reservoir the reservoir release is 2215 m3 s 32 higher in the dry season and 3150 m3 s 13 lower in the wet season under the all reservoirs scenario than the natural flow scenario 5 discussion 5 1 prospects and possible limitations of data driven reservoir operation simulations as an estimated 2 8 million reservoirs have been constructed globally recent research efforts in improving the representations of reservoir operation in hydrologic models are flourishing veldkamp et al 2018 turner et al 2020 boulange et al 2021 as a powerful ensemble learning algorithm the xgboost has been one of the most popular machine learning methods to overcome difficulties in a variety of earth system modelling applications in this study we developed two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann respectively to predict the reservoir release and storage in the hydrologic models in general both algorithms exhibit satisfactory results in modelling reservoir operation based on historic in situ reservoir operation data in particular compared with the ann based scheme the xgboost based scheme shows a slightly better predicting accuracy of reservoir releases and storages daily nse around 0 9 for all of the reservoirs which is comparable to those reported by other studies ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 this implies that xgboost can be applicable in hydrologic simulations and predictions in reservoir regulated basins the proposed hybrid hydrologic modelling framework also has the potential for improving real time streamflow forecasting for example hydrologic models can be driven by future meteorologic forecast to generate future reservoir inflow forecasts yang et al 2019 the inflow can then be input to the data driven and conceptual reservoir operation schemes to predict the future reservoir releases allowing the information of inflow forecasts to be reasonably transferred downstream an issue associated with the data driven reservoir model is its fundamentally black box nature which may be subject to a degraded performance in extrapolation beyond the training data to alleviate this problem several storage constraints are applied to the machine learning algorithms in this study forming up a physics informed data driven approach if the calculated storage fails to meet the constraints the predicted release in this step is recalculated via the reservoir water balance equation fig 1 this approach is similar to that adopted by gangrade et al 2022 who used a few empirical equations to constrain the predicted results of their proposed long short term memory model lstm based reservoir operation scheme however it is also worth noting that the simulation accuracy reported in their study is somewhat lower than those reported in the existing literature which could be due to the exclusion of reservoir release in the predictors of the regression model this suggests that inclusion of reservoir release in a closed loop form may help achieve more accurate predictions with data driven reservoir operation schemes 5 2 possible future directions of data driven reservoir operation simulations often the lack of reservoir operation data limits the use of machine learning in reservoir modelling leaving the conceptual reservoir operation scheme the only choice in hydrologic models as in our hybrid modelling framework however we believe there is room for improvement of machine learning approaches with respect to ungauged reservoirs notably recent studies have attempted to employ the lstm model to predict streamflow in ungauged basins arsenault et al 2023 kratzert et al 2019 this was done by 1 training the machine learning model using the long term meteorological data and static features of the basin as predictors and streamflow as the predictand for a large number of basins usually greater than 100 and 2 testing the model in other basins that are in the test samples which are a proxy for ungauged basins by doing so both arsenault et al 2023 kratzert et al 2019 have reported superior accuracies of lstm model in simulating the streamflow in these test basins over the traditional hydrologic model even if the traditional models are well calibrated in these basins such an idea could be transferrable to operation simulations of reservoirs without historic operation data this will be one of our future research directions 6 conclusions in this study two data driven reservoir operation schemes based on xgboost and ann are developed to predict the reservoir release in hydrologic models for reservoirs with historic operation data then a hybrid hydrologic modelling framework is proposed by using the data driven reservoir operation scheme in a high resolution 3 km hydrologic model together with a calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme designed for data scarce reservoirs this allows quantitative assessment of the cumulative impacts of dam operation on the hydrologic regime under different reservoir data availability as a test application the proposed hybrid modelling framework is applied to the upper yangtze river basin where ten major operational reservoirs are taken into consideration i e three gorges xiluodu jinping i goupitan ertan pubugou tingzikou baozhusi zipingpu and changheba by comparing with the in situ reservoir releases and storage we show that both of the developed xgboost and ann based reservoir operation schemes trained from the historic in situ reservoir operation data i e inflow release storage can accurately reconstruct the reservoir releases and storage considered in our study the xgboost generally shows a slightly superior accuracy over ann with all of the daily nse values of simulated releases and storage are over 0 85 the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme despite exhibiting a lower simulation accuracy can generally capture the release and storage variations of the major reservoirs in the uyrb which suggests this scheme can be used for simulations of reservoirs without reservoir operation data by coupling the xgboost based reservoir operation scheme and the calibration free conceptual reservoir operation scheme with the hydrologic model the model shows a remarkably improved performance in reconstructing the historic streamflow at the yichang station i e the outlet of uyrb on its basis four sets of 10 year 2011 2020 simulations with a spatial resolution of 3 km are conducted to analyze the likely streamflow variations under the cumulative impacts of the operation of 10 major reservoirs in the uyrb simulation results show that the mainstream and tributary reservoirs have a notable cumulative impact on the hydrologic regime at the local scale and the regional scale by redistributing the excessive water resources in the wet season to the dry season leading to an improved level of water security especially along the mainstream reservoirs also attenuate the high flows and low flows along the river with the maximum 1 day to 90 day streamflow reducing by 9 21 and the minimum 1 day to 90 day streamflow increasing by 79 101 respectively this study proposes a hybrid hydrologic modelling framework with the combined use of data driven and conceptual reservoir operation schemes that can be applicable worldwide future research directions include the development of a generalized data driven reservoir operation modelling

2091,understanding the interaction between the hydrological cycle and vegetation management strategies such as thinning is essential to improve watershed management and support ecological services however it remains unclear how thinning affects the key components of hydrological cycle of dense shrublands in the semiarid regions thus the purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the effect of thinning on rainfall partitioning and interception simulations in dense shrublands in a 5 year field experiment we compared rainfall partitioning in two re vegetated shrublands caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila in the chinese loess plateau under two thinning intensities moderate thinning mt and heavy thinning ht refer to the removal of 25 and 50 of the branches respectively or no thinning nt control we modeled canopy interception losses i in the two thinning treatments and control treatment using the revised gash model the results showed that under mt and ht the throughfall tf rate increased by about 12 and 20 respectively compared to nt the stemflow sf and observed i rates decreased by about 26 and 33 respectively under mt and the corresponding values for ht were about 50 and 52 respectively the observed i rate decreased proportional to the percentage of biomass removed from the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots the results also revealed a significant linear correlation between the plant area index pai value and the canopy water balance of the two shrub plantations r2 0 83 p 0 05 the performance of the revised gash model i e relative error re 20

subjected to mt and ht re 3 than nt re 9 3 for s psammophila changes in the canopy storage capacity and canopy evaporation rate strongly affected changes in simulated interception loss the model can facilitate water management in semiarid shrub plantations by accurately simulating the effect of thinning on interception loss keywords rainfall partitioning interception revised gash model thinning shrubland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation restoration based on unreasonable density is a fact that currently exists in many arid and semiarid areas cao et al 2011 farley et al 2005 feng et al 2016 molina del campo 2012 highly dense vegetation consumes soil moisture and increases interception of limited precipitation in arid and semiarid regions chen et al 2010 christina et al 2017 ge et al 2022 robinson et al 2006 shao et al 2018 as a result insufficient water supply to supplement evapotranspiration which ultimately aggravates soil drought conditions and leads to the formation of a dry layer in the soil the conditions as mentioned above make the vegetation unsustainable with vegetation decline partial death or stunting where trees remain small for decades jia et al 2019 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 under these conditions the water conservation function of the vegetation cover is extremely limited therefore studying changes in key components of the hydrological cycle after reducing vegetation density in water limited regions is necessary to improve watershed management and support ecological services in arid and semi arid areas of the loess plateau like the northern areas of the qinghai tibetian plateau and the greater hinggan mountains in china the vegetation in these areas is dominated by shrubs zhang et al 2022 due to the nature conservation policy of the local government these shrubs have seldom been managed since their established resulting in unmanaged dense shrub canopies that intercept more rainfall and consume more water drought induced branch dieback has recently been a frequent phenomenon in these plantations ma et al 2020 this suggests that the current structural characteristics of these shrub regions may not be conducive to alleviating regional drought and these areas need more rainfall to preserve and supplement local water resources it is necessary to allow as much rainfall as possible to reach the surface and be stored in the soil rather than being lost to evaporation through interception as a result shrub plantations could be reduced in density at a large spatial scale to increase resilience in the face of severe drought stress and future climate change thinning is a common vegetation management practice aimed at reducing the canopy density and improving the quality of the remaining vegetation gebhardt et al 2014 grunicke et al 2020 momiyama et al 2021 sun et al 2015 in recent decades experimental evidence from different forest ecosystems has demonstrated that thinning can promote the vitality of residual trees and reduce long term stress due to competition for water nutrients and light thinning can also increase the resilience and resistance of forest trees to severe drought stress and thus may be an effective approach to climate adaptation gebhardt et al 2014 grunicke et al 2020 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in addition thinning affects hydrological processes including evaporation transpiration rainfall partitioning soil water content and surface flow in vegetated ecosystems gebhardt et al 2014 del campo et al 2019 sun et al 2014 canopy interception which accounts for 5 40 of total rainfall is an important part of the shrub water cycle yue et al 2021 it determines the amount of net rainfall reaching the soil and is a key component in the hydrological cycle however few studies have explored practical strategies for managing highly dense shrublands with most focusing on forests grunicke et al 2020 sun et al 2015 in recent decades many observational studies have focused on canopy interception of shrubs in arid and semiarid areas at the individual plant scale an et al 2022 domingo et al 1998 jian et al 2018 li et al 2008 tonello et al 2021 yang et al 2019a yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 extrapolating the results of these studies to heterogeneous landscapes is a challenge in this context interception needs to be quantified at the stand or plot scale rather than at the individual plant scale due to plot level measurements of interception have the advantage that the results can be scaled up for example using traditional cover methods snyder et al 2022 furthermore plot level experimental results are generally applicable to a watershed and they cannot be confidently applied where conditions are markedly different particularly regarding rainfall regimes and vegetation types while interception models allow the extrapolation of measurements in space and time and can be used to predict the effects of climate and land cover change on water resources magliano et al 2022 therefore model simulations continue to be the main focus of vegetation canopy interception research widely used models for estimating interception losses are the original gash model and the revised version of this model muzylo et al 2009 the original gash model a simplified version of the rutter model gash 1979 rutter et al 1975 the gash model represents rainfall input as a series of discrete storms separated by intervals sufficiently long for the canopy and stems to dry completely this assumption is possible because of the rapid drying of forest canopies each storm is then divided into three subsequent phases canopy wetting up saturation and drying this separation emphasizes the relative importance of the climate against plant structure gash et al 1995 proposed the sparse versions of gash model to adjust the original model formulations to forest stands with significant open spaces between the tree canopies a crucial change is that in the sparse versions the evaporation rate from wetted surfaces is no longer calculated for the entire plot area but only for the area covered by the canopy this change overcame a poor boundary condition in the original models whereby the modeled canopy failed to wet up beyond a certain degree of sparseness as might be expected the gash sparse model gives better results than the original version in terms of modelling error 76 of the model applications resulted in errors below 10 with an important contribution of model performances with errors under 5 51 of the applications in contrast the gash original model the figure was 27 the better performance of the gash sparse model may be due to the conceptual changes introduced in this version but it may also be caused by many of the applications not being duly validated it should also be mentioned that the original version has mainly been applied to temperate climates whereas the sparse version has been applied mainly to tropical and semiarid climates also with good results deng et al 2022 herbst et al 2006 junqueira junior et al 2019 limousin et al 2008 ma et al 2019 2020 however this model has rarely been applied to shrubs compared to forests in semiarid areas the lack of research in this area can be attributed to the fact that evaporation from wet shrubland canopies unlike wet forest canopies is not a net water loss david et al 2005 and because of the difficult techniques of water flow measurement dunkerley 2000 domingo et al 1998 showed that interception models could be successfully applied to shrubs despite their structural differences from forests recently several studies have measured rainfall partitioning after changes in forest structure and derived interception parameters for model applications grunicke et al 2020 ma et al 2020 sun et al 2015 most of these studies have been based on measurement data only over several months one growing season or one year hence the model parameters are derived from very short datasets few long term studies i e 1 year have focused on shrub structural changes few long term studies i e 1 year have focused on the effect of structural changes in the shrubland canopy over time on interception loss the aims of this study were to 1 quantify the effects of vegetation changes on rainfall partitioning in control and thinned plots of two shrub species caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila and 2 clarify changes in interception processes using the revised gash model based on the determination of interception parameters with these aims in mind we conducted a 5 year experiment in which we measured rainfall partitioning in two re vegetated shrublands c korshinskii and s psammophila in the chinese loess plateau subjected to two thinning intensities moderate thinning mt and heavy thinning ht and no thinning nt the revised gash model modeled canopy interception losses in the control and thinned treatments this results of this study can help to predict and manage ecohydrological change in water limited ecosystems in the context of shifting shrub cover and climate conditions 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the liudaogou watershed 38 78 n 110 35 e 1 200 m altitude 6 89 km2 of shenmu county shaanxi province china fig 1 the watershed is located in an area of the loess plateau known as a water wind erosion crisscross region the climate in the region is mid temperate semiarid the average annual precipitation between 2003 and 2021 was 457 mm with approximately 83 of precipitation occurring between june and october the potential evaporation is 1 200 mm y 1 and the average annual temperature is 9 6 c january and july are the coldest and warmest with average monthly temperatures of 6 4 and 23 5 c respectively aeolian sandy soil and loess are typical soil types in this catchment two shrub species c korshinskii and s psammophila are widely planted for ecological restoration in the catchment rainfall and high temperature seasons are synchronized with plant growth in early april and plant senescence in late october the present experiment commenced in 2017 and monitoring continued until 2021 two plantations of c korshinskii 30 10 m and s psammophila 15 6 m on the level ground were selected each plot was further subdivided into three equal plots of 10 10 m and 5 6 m fig 1 c korshinskii and s psammophila were planted in 2013 and the average plant heights at the start of the study were 165 and 290 cm respectively both c korshinskii and s psammophila have an inverted cone canopy and are multi stemmed shrubs with no trunk or branches extending obliquely from the base in june 2019 for c korshinskii one plot was subjected to mt one was subjected to ht and one was left nt as a control likewise for s psammophila one plot was subjected to mt one was subjected to ht and one nt was left as a control fig 1 in the mt plots 25 of the branches were removed whereas 50 of the branches were removed in the ht plots all thinning operations were conducted by local villagers using branch shears to minimize soil disturbance on the plots all twigs and branches from the thinned shrubs were removed from the plots the number of branches in each plot post treatment is shown in fig 2 despite the significant difference in the number of branches base diameters in the three plots under the three various densities for two shrubs the frequency distribution was not significantly different 2 2 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements gross precipitation pg mm was measured using an onset onset computer corp bourne ma u s a rg3 m tipping bucket rain gauge 0 2 mm per tip located 3 m outside the plots in the study area as automatic rain gauges generally underestimate rainfall three manual rain gauges 20 cm diameter were placed around it for calibration and were read immediately after each rainfall event in this way rainfall characteristics such as the rainfall duration h and average rainfall intensity mm h 1 were calculated a rain event was defined as a period with 0 2 mm of total pg separated by at least 6 h without rain throughfall tf mm was measured using 13 rain gauges 20 cm diameter at each study plot to overcome spatial variability in tf the rain gauges at each plot were randomly placed every year the average tf was computed from all functioning rain gauges to reduce evaporative loss from the rain gauges tf was measured within 2 h after rainfall ended during the daytime to reduce evaporative loss from the rain gauges if a rainfall event ended at night tf was measured early the next morning stemflow sf mm was measured on 12 representative branches at each study plot with three branches from branch basal diameter bd categories of 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 18 mm sf was collected using aluminum foil collars each collar was fitted around the entire branch circumference and near the base of the branch and sealed with neutral silicone caulk fig 1 a 0 8 cm diameter pvc hose was used to guide the sf into a container fitted with a lid the collars and hoses were checked periodically for leaks and blockages respectively after obtaining these measurements sf was returned to the branch base to alleviate unnecessary drought stress on the sample branches the sf depth after each rainfall event was calculated in each shrub plot as follows 1 s f v i 1 n v i 1000 2 s f d s f v pa where sfv is the sf volume l of a plot after a rainfall event vi is the sf volume ml collected from individual stems in a plot n is the total number of stems in a plot sfd is the sf depth mm and pa is the plot area m2 the observed interception loss i mm was calculated using equation 3 3 i p g t f s f one way anova post hoc tukey s tests was used to recognize the significant differences p 0 05 in rainfall partitioning variables across treatments in the same year and the same treatments in different years statistical analysis was performed in spss ibm spss statistics version 25 0 2 3 revised gash analytical model 2 3 1 description of the model in the revised gash analytical model pg is expressed as a series of discrete rainfall events in which the canopy has sufficient time to dry before another rainfall event begins gash et al 1995 each rainfall event includes three phases wetting saturation and cessation the total canopy interception was obtained by summing the interception losses of the canopy during each phase of a rainfall event rainfall events were analyzed separately from a threshold value of pg to determine whether the canopy was saturated to calculate interception loss the revised analytical model incorporates two types of data canopy and climatic parameters the canopy parameters are the canopy storage capacity s canopy cover c free tf coefficient p calculated using equation 4 trunk storage capacity st and rainfall fraction diverted into sf pt the climatic parameters are pg mean evaporation rate e mm h 1 and mean rainfall intensity r mm h 1 during each rainfall event the amounts of rainwater required to saturate the canopy and trunk fully were calculated using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 p 1 c 5 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r 6 p t s t p t where pg and pt are the amounts of rainwater required to saturate the canopy and trunk fully respectively e c mm h 1 is the mean evaporation rate per unit area of canopy cover sc mm is the canopy storage capacity per unit area of cover the revised analytical model divides simulated interception loss into five components and the equation used to calculate each component is shown in table 1 2 3 2 estimation of the model parameters the s was obtained as a linear relationship between pg and the sum of tf and sf where the s was the value of pg when the sum of tf and sf was zero wallace mcjannet 2008 canopy cover was estimated using hemispherical photographs taken by fisheye webcams during the growing season and data were processed using can eye software version 6 3 niu et al 2021 weiss baret 2014 the st and pt were estimated using the method of gash and morton 1978 as the negative intercept and slope of the linear regression between pg and sf the e was estimated using the method of buttle and farnsworth 2012 and calculated using equation 7 7 e a r where a is the slope of the linear regression between pg and observed i for pg pg and r represents the mean rainfall intensity is 10 mm h 1 2 3 3 model evaluation the performance of the revised gash analytical model was evaluated using relative error re the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse metric nash sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse the re was the difference between the values estimated by the model and the measured values muzylo et al 2009 classified the performance of the interception rainfall model according to the re as follows poor re 30 fair 10 re 30 good 5 re 10 very good 1 re 5 and extremely good re 1 the nse measures the performance of each interception model as compared to the mean and can be used to assess the predictive power of the model the rmse was used to quantify the agreement between the measured data and the model predictions these three metrics are more suitable used to evaluate hydrological models 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the revised gash model five parameters s c pt st and e r were subjected to a sensitivity analysis in the analysis the values of these parameters were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values the simulated results were then compared with the actual measurement data the methodology in this study is further presented in a flowchart in fig 3 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the daily precipitation amounts intensities and durations for the 2017 2021 are shown in fig 4 in total 674 2 mm of precipitation occurred in 2017 637 2 mm in 2018 436 5 mm in 2019 359 3 mm in 2020 and 320 0 mm in 2021 according to the average annual precipitation 457 0 mm between 2003 and 2021 2017 and 2018 were classified as wet years whereas 2019 2020 and 2021 were classified as normal dry and extremely dry years respectively rainfall was unevenly distributed throughout the year with a mean of 88 0 occurring during the rainy season may october in 2017 2021 individual rainfall events ranged from 0 2 to 92 5 mm with an average of 7 6 mm the rainfall intensity ranged from 0 2 to 40 7 mm h 1 with an average of 4 2 mm h 1 the rainfall duration ranged from 0 1 to 26 6 h with an average of 3 1 h as shown in table 2 rainfall events 10 mm account for about 75 of the rainfall events during 2017 2021 and about 90 have rainfall intensities 10 mm h 1 the wet years are mainly characterized by a few more rainfall events 40 mm compared to the dry years during the experimental periods purple dashed lines fig 4a in the 5 years from 2017 to 2021 116 rainfall events were recorded with a total of 1 587 8 mm among them 780 4 mm 49 1 of total pg in the pre thinning period 2017 2018 and 807 4 mm 50 9 of total pg in the post thinning period 2019 2021 the frequency distributions of event size and intensity during the pre thinning and post thinning periods are shown in fig 5 generally small rainfall events low depths were more frequent and contributed to a lower total pg percentage than large rainfall events fig 5a c generally the event frequency of low intensity rainfall events range 0 5 mm h 1 was higher 50 of total events than the frequency of high intensity rainfall events in the pre thinning and post thinning periods fig 5b d this suggested that lower intensity rainfall events accounted for a higher percentage of total pg 3 2 rainfall partitioning measurements the changes in annual rainfall partitioning during the pre and post thinning periods are shown in fig 6 and table 3 in 2017 2018 before thinning there were no significant differences in the ratios of tf sf and i to pg in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots subjected to nt mt and ht in 2019 2021 after thinning both thinned plots had a higher tf rate than the plots subjected to nt fig 6a b in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots the tf rate increased by about 12 mt and 20 ht compared to the plots subjected to nt in contrast the sf and i rates significantly decreased with thinning intensity fig 6c d e f in the c korshinskii plots the total sf decreased by 21 mt and 49 ht and the total i decreased by 37 mt and 54 ht compared to the plot subjected to nt corresponding values for s psammophila were 31 mt and 50 ht for the sf rate and 29 mt and 50 ht for the i rate for both shrub species although the ratio of i to pg was highest under the nt treatment in 2021 the plots in the thinned treatments had already reached 68 5 mt and 48 6 ht of this value for c korshinskii 73 0 mt and 67 2 ht for s psammophila it is important to emphasize that in the plots subjected to ht the effects of the extremely dry year 2021 on total i cannot be determined the relationship between pg and canopy water balance tf sf and i based on rainfall event data is shown in fig 7 the event based canopy water balance amount increased linearly with pg p 0 01 the ratio of canopy water balance to pg varied greatly throughout the study period and stabilized gradually under rainfall events 20 mm 3 3 model parameterization model input parameters may provide insights into the quality of the model s performance and be useful in the model s result interpretation so they should be given priority consideration from the linear regressions of pg and rainfall partitioning components fig 6 the study derived the required parameter values in the revised gash model applied to the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots under nt mt and ht are shown in tables 4 and 5 the estimated canopy parameters s pai c pt and st and climatic parameter e gradually decreased as thinning intensity increased for example the s of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots decreased from 0 90 0 05 to 0 40 0 10 mm and the e decreased from 0 30 0 02 to 0 13 0 03 specifically the s pt and st values of c korshinskii were slightly larger than those of s psammophila in the plots under nt mt and ht parameters for the observed periods agree with the development of vegetation structure table 4 the thinning treatments reduced the measured parameters of vegetation structure plant area index pai and c to about 73 mt and 50 ht of the corresponding values of the control nt table 4 in 2017 2018 two wet years the relative pai increase rpai i i e the change in the pai divided by the initial pai was within 10 of all plots in 2019 2020 a normal and dry year respectively the rpai i declined to a lesser extent in the thinned plots mt and ht compared with the plots subjected to nt especially in the c korshinskii plots in 2021 under particularly dry conditions the degree of decrease in the rpai i of the plots subjected to ht was reduced by about half compared with that of the plots under nt and mt although the pai of the nt treatment was the highest in 2021 the plots on the thinned treatments had already reached about 85 mt and 70 ht of this value for two shrubs based on 5 years of measurement data there was a simple linear relationship between the pai values and canopy water balance of the two shrub plantations fig 8 according to the findings the tf rate decreased in accordance with an increase in the pai in the two shrub plantations whereas sf and i rates increased in accordance with an increase in the pai 3 4 rainfall interception modeling the performance of the revised gash model for the entire monitoring period 2017 2021 in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots subjected to nt is illustrated in fig 9 and table 6 comparing the simulated i with the measured values showed that the revised gash model severely underestimated i in wet years 2017 and 2018 especially in the presence of an individual rainfall event 40 mm such as that occurred in 2019 despite this classified as a normal year in dry years 2020 and 2021 when there were many individual rainfall events of 10 mm the revised gash model overestimated i applying the method proposed by muzylo et al 2009 the performance of the revised gash model in simulating i in both shrub plantations was classified as fair for both shrubs throughout the observation period poor in wet and extremely dry years and fair in normal and dry years but in 2020 dry year the performance of the revised model in simulating i by s psammophila was classified as very good in the nt mt and ht plots of c korshinskii and s psammophila individual rainfall events observed during june july and september of 2019 2021 were used to calibrate the revised gash model the calibrated models were then validated using measurements obtained in august and october 2019 2021 the measured and simulated total i according to the revised gash model are summarized in table 7 and plotted in fig 10 the i was underestimated to varying degrees in the calibration period such as in nt plots with underestimation of 3 0 for c korshinskii and 14 5 for s psammophila as the degree of thinning increased the degree of underestimation gradually increased in contrast to the results of the revised gash model in the calibration period in the validation period the revised model overestimated i with the degree of overestimation decreasing in accordance with the thinning intensity both root mean square error rmse and nse values gradually decreased with an increase in the thinning intensity in both the calibration and validation periods the performance of the revised gash model in all the plots varied from fair to good to very good with a re of 20 0 as shown in fig 10 the simulated values of individual rainfall events were slightly higher than the measured values when the rainfall amounts were small when the rainfall amounts were large the simulated values were lower than the measured values based on the correlation r2 of the simulated and observed values the validation period was slightly better than the calibration period fig 10 changes in interception components were compared in the six plots of the two shrub species fig 11 the sum of evaporation during and after rainfall consistently accounted for the largest component of estimated interception loss about 90 with an increase in the thinning intensity evaporation during rainfall gradually decreased in the c korshinskii plots from 51 6 to 42 9 but increased in the s psammophila plots from 55 1 to 57 1 in contrast evaporation after rainfall gradually increased in the c korshinskii plots from 37 4 to 44 8 but decreased in the s psammophila plots from 35 4 to 30 6 to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the revised gash model a sensitivity analysis of five parameters s c pt st and e r was conducted fig 12 e r and s were the most sensitive parameters in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots followed by c st and pt 4 discussion 4 1 thinning effects on rainfall partitioning the tf rate gradually increased while the sf and observed i rates decreased with increasing thinning intensity on an annual scale fig 6 although the gross amount of incident rainfall directly determines the magnitudes of tf and sf fig 7 and levels of saturation of canopy and stem surfaces carlyle moses 2004 levia et al 2010 many studies have shown that the factors affecting rainfall partitioning patterns include meteorological variables such as rainfall intensity air temperature and potential evapotranspiration crockford richardson 2000 llorens domingo 2007 staelens et al 2008 and the actual contributions are also dependent on vegetation composition and structure crockford richardson 2000 sadeghi et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 shrub structures e g canopy cover and stand density strongly affect variations in rainfall partitioning chang et al 2022 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 thinning alters the structures of shrub plots and can serve as an important method for regulating the redistribution of water resources in watersheds with shrubland cover thus examining changes in various components of the shrub water cycle such as transpiration and evapotranspiration as a result of thinning is important to improve understanding of the processes underlying changes in the water yield in the present study changes in rainfall partitioning due to thinning were consistent with a simple linear relationship between the pai and canopy water balance values of the two shrub plantations based on 5 years of measurement data fig 8 thus the linear relationship can be used as a useful tool for predicting net precipitation and observed i rates when the pai of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots was the same the tf rates of c korshinskii was significantly higher than that of s psammophila whereas the i rates of c korshinskii was significantly lower than that of s psammophila there was no significant difference in the sf rates of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots fig 8 however in studies conducted in regions with climatic variables similar to those in the present study when assessing at the individual plant level not the stand level the sf rate of c korshinskii was significantly higher than that of s psammophila and there was no significant difference in the tf rate yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2019b these findings can be explained by the canopy projection area of different shrubs the canopy projection area of c korshinskii is smaller than that of s psammophila in addition as the stand density increases the degree of overestimation of tf and underestimation of sf and i increases at the individual plant level as a result measurements of i at the individual plant level may underestimate results at the stand level at biome and global scales thus the role of rainfall partitioning in hydrological processes needs to be studied at the plant community level results from the 3 years after thinning of this study indicate that more heavily thinning treatments had more pronounced effects on shrub growth net precipitation and interception especially in dry years table 4 however the effects of thinning intensity are subject to the interplay among various factors when shrub plots become dense over time the canopy intercepts more rain potentially shortening the soil water recharge process snyder et al 2022 in water limited regions abiotic and biotic factors affect the soil water content vegetation depends on soil moisture and soil moisture is affected by water uptake by plants shading sf and i llorens domingo 2007 metzger et al 2017 rodriguez iturbe 2000 if a reduction in net precipitation sum of tf and sf is not balanced by a reduction in evaporation due to canopy shading high densities of shrubs may have a significant impact on the water budget of the respective ecosystem comparative studies of different thinning intensities can help us to determine the most suitable thinning method for shrub plots to reduce drought stress for example gebhardt et al 2014 indicated that repeated moderate thinning was a better option than the heavy thinning because of heavy thinning induced the progressive development of understory which not only competed for resources with trees but also hindered natural regeneration in this study the understory of s psammophila plot was sparse so its effects are expected to be minor still for c korshinskii plot the role of the understory in the longer term could become important affecting the difference between the two thinning treatments this further emphasizes the need to examine the long term effects of the thinning treatments in the two shrub plots in this study 4 2 interception parameters the s of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots remained around or below 1 mm throughout the monitoring period table 4 which agrees well with findings obtained for other semiarid shrub species zhang et al 2018 the s of forests is significantly higher than that of shrubs in similar areas for example ma et al 2019 reported a s value of 1 34 for roinia pseudoacacia and 1 43 for pinus tabuliformis other studies reported that climatic variables e g rainfall intensity and wind speed and canopy traits e g cover height and leaf area index influenced s carlyle moses gash 2011 in this study sf was relatively low compared to the values obtained for other parts of rainfall partitioning in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots table 4 the sf related parameters st and pt around 0 1 mm in two shrub plots were much lower than those reported by zhang et al 2018 0 55 mm for st and 0 68 mm for pt but measured sf rates agreed with those found in previous studies in semiarid regions yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2019b li et al 2008 yue et al 2021 in this study the observed mean values of st and pt were slightly higher in the c korshinskii plots than in the s psammophila plots these findings can be explained by the lower threshold of precipitation 0 9 mm for c korshinskii vs 2 1 mm for s psammophila and beneficial leaf traits of c korshinskii versus those of s psammophila yuan et al 2017 in the present study changes in canopy structure induced by thinning altered interception parameters e g s p and e thereby influencing i table 4 as reported previously the s and p also lead to spatial variability in tf loustau et al 1992 sun et al 2015 in this study in the three thinning years there was a greater reduction in s st and pt in the shrub plots subjected to nt and mt than ht during 2019 2021 p also increased under nt 0 25 and 0 13 for c korshinskii and s psammophila respectively and mt 0 10 and 0 08 for c korshinskii and s psammophila respectively with decreasing rainfall in the plots subjected to ht p slightly increased and remained at a high level 0 03 for both c korshinskii and s psammophila both light exposure and aerodynamic conductance of branches increase with an increase in canopy openness caused by thinning thus changing meteorological conditions such as temperature humidity and wind speed all of which control evaporation of water intercepted and stored within the canopy pypker et al 2005 the revised gash model performance 10 re 20 improved over the entire observation period compared to weaker gash model performance 24 re 84 for a single year table 4 fluctuations in model result from the years see fig 9 and table 6 reflect data availability within a single year rather than vegetation change generally the reliability of derived model parameters depends on the dataset i e measurement duration from which the parameters are obtained in this study the parameters derived from three different hydrological years normal dry and extremely dry yielded better simulation results than the parameters derived from only one type of hydrological year tables 6 and 7 this clearly shows that the performance of the revised gash analytical model depends on reliable parameterization including a range of parameters in the revised model from a large number of hydrological years can enable estimations of rainfall interception over time which can be used in shrub water balance studies in arid and semiarid regions 4 3 performance of the revised gash analytical model the revised gash analytical model provided good estimates of the total i in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots tables 6 and 7 and it also captured canopy density variation based on the rmse the revised gash model performed better after thinning than before in contrast the nse values were markedly better before thinning than after thinning table 7 this is not surprising as intensive thinning greatly reduces variability in i and tf and these models are not designed to measure rainfall events in the open field shinohara et al 2015 in terms of modeling error the underestimation of simulated total i using the revised gash model was similar under the nt treatment in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots table 6 and within the range reported by other studies fan et al 2014 fathizadeh et al 2018 junqueira junior et al 2019 limousin et al 2008 shinohara et al 2015 muzylo et al 2009 concluded that the expected modeling error in the prediction of interception loss can be as high as 20 in this study i was slightly overestimated in the control and thinned plots for small rainfall events during the calibration and validation periods for high rainfall events the predicted i was far from the 1 1 line in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots fig 10 the revised gash model severely underestimated i as rainfall increased fig 9 thus this model should be used with caution in areas with high rainfall events fathizadeh et al 2018 limousin et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 based on meteorological data collected using automatic rain gauges in the study area in the past ten years single rainfall events with heavy rainfall amounts 40 mm account for about 30 of the total rainfall therefore the effect of such rainfall events should be considered in future research to improve the performance of the model the thinning treatments altered the the interception components in the present study evaporation during storm events and the post storm period accounted for the largest amount of interception loss before and after thinning fig 11 which is consistent with the findings of previous studies sun et al 2015 ma et al 2019 2020 changes in s and e strongly affected i fig 12 the degree of decrease in the s of the c korshinskii plots under mt and ht relative to that under nt was smaller than the degree of decrease in e however in the s psammophila plots the decrease in the s of the plots subjected to mt and ht relative to that in the plot subjected to nt was greater than the decrease in e table 4 therefore s was the main cause of the decrease in i in the thinned plots of c korshinskii whereas the e was the main cause in the thinned plots of s psammophila quantification of interception components before and after thinning can help to improve understanding of changes in interception processes as well as underlying processes of peak flows infiltration and water resources in this ecosystem typically model error refers to the results of model validation rather than calibration muzylo et al 2009 this paper shows performance of the revised gash model in s psammophila plots than in c korshinskii plots during the validation period this indicates the revised gash model for interception loss modeling can be more appropriate for the s psammophila plots than for the c korshinskii plots in terms of re and nse values table 7 as noted in previous studies the revised version has been extensively applied in semiarid climates where sparse vegetation cover is common and performs well fan et al 2014 muzylo et al 2009 interception modeling is important for estimating the water balance and thus plays a crucial role in hydrological simulations and determining eco hydrological services junqueira junior et al 2019 future work should focus on operationalizing canopy interception models for routine use by shrub managers to optimize shrub management strategies 5 conclusions thinning increased net precipitation reaching the soil surface and reduced canopy interception in the plots subjected to ht significant effects of the extremely dry year could not be identified in rainfall partitioning measurements and canopy parameters such as the pai and s this suggests that ht allows both c korshinskii and s psammophila plots to adapt better to dry weather conditions the interception parameters s c pt st and e decreased with thinning intensity and changes in s and e strongly affected simulated i of note the decrease in simulated i in the thinned plots of c korshinskii was mainly caused by the s whereas it was mainly caused by the e in the s psammophila plots the revised analytical gash model provided a good estimate of the total i of the two shrub species re 20 however when evaluating the i of individual rainfall events the simulation ability and accuracy of the model decreased significantly with moderate overestimation of low rainfall events 10 mm and severe underestimation of high rainfall events 40 mm these over and underestimations were mainly caused by uncertainty in the input parameters using data from a type hydrological year or growing season to derive canopy parameters is not recommended parameters that can reliably estimate i can only be generated using data with varying rainfall amounts moreover as intensive thinning greatly reduces the variability in i the revised analytical gash model performed better after thinning than before thinning based on the re values although the effects of thinning on rainfall partitioning in this study lasted for three years the effective length of time for thinning remains to be addressed in addition further studies should also evaluate the effects of other important water cycle elements soil moisture transpiration etc to address the effects on the whole water cycle and to improve the implementation of tree plantations in water limited regions credit authorship contribution statement xiaotao niu conceptualization investigation methodology software visualization writing

2091,understanding the interaction between the hydrological cycle and vegetation management strategies such as thinning is essential to improve watershed management and support ecological services however it remains unclear how thinning affects the key components of hydrological cycle of dense shrublands in the semiarid regions thus the purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the effect of thinning on rainfall partitioning and interception simulations in dense shrublands in a 5 year field experiment we compared rainfall partitioning in two re vegetated shrublands caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila in the chinese loess plateau under two thinning intensities moderate thinning mt and heavy thinning ht refer to the removal of 25 and 50 of the branches respectively or no thinning nt control we modeled canopy interception losses i in the two thinning treatments and control treatment using the revised gash model the results showed that under mt and ht the throughfall tf rate increased by about 12 and 20 respectively compared to nt the stemflow sf and observed i rates decreased by about 26 and 33 respectively under mt and the corresponding values for ht were about 50 and 52 respectively the observed i rate decreased proportional to the percentage of biomass removed from the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots the results also revealed a significant linear correlation between the plant area index pai value and the canopy water balance of the two shrub plantations r2 0 83 p 0 05 the performance of the revised gash model i e relative error re 20 was satisfactory according to the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient 0 34 0 71 based on the re values the performance of the revised gash model was better when applied to the plots subjected to mt and ht re 3 than nt re 9 3 for s psammophila changes in the canopy storage capacity and canopy evaporation rate strongly affected changes in simulated interception loss the model can facilitate water management in semiarid shrub plantations by accurately simulating the effect of thinning on interception loss keywords rainfall partitioning interception revised gash model thinning shrubland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation restoration based on unreasonable density is a fact that currently exists in many arid and semiarid areas cao et al 2011 farley et al 2005 feng et al 2016 molina del campo 2012 highly dense vegetation consumes soil moisture and increases interception of limited precipitation in arid and semiarid regions chen et al 2010 christina et al 2017 ge et al 2022 robinson et al 2006 shao et al 2018 as a result insufficient water supply to supplement evapotranspiration which ultimately aggravates soil drought conditions and leads to the formation of a dry layer in the soil the conditions as mentioned above make the vegetation unsustainable with vegetation decline partial death or stunting where trees remain small for decades jia et al 2019 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 under these conditions the water conservation function of the vegetation cover is extremely limited therefore studying changes in key components of the hydrological cycle after reducing vegetation density in water limited regions is necessary to improve watershed management and support ecological services in arid and semi arid areas of the loess plateau like the northern areas of the qinghai tibetian plateau and the greater hinggan mountains in china the vegetation in these areas is dominated by shrubs zhang et al 2022 due to the nature conservation policy of the local government these shrubs have seldom been managed since their established resulting in unmanaged dense shrub canopies that intercept more rainfall and consume more water drought induced branch dieback has recently been a frequent phenomenon in these plantations ma et al 2020 this suggests that the current structural characteristics of these shrub regions may not be conducive to alleviating regional drought and these areas need more rainfall to preserve and supplement local water resources it is necessary to allow as much rainfall as possible to reach the surface and be stored in the soil rather than being lost to evaporation through interception as a result shrub plantations could be reduced in density at a large spatial scale to increase resilience in the face of severe drought stress and future climate change thinning is a common vegetation management practice aimed at reducing the canopy density and improving the quality of the remaining vegetation gebhardt et al 2014 grunicke et al 2020 momiyama et al 2021 sun et al 2015 in recent decades experimental evidence from different forest ecosystems has demonstrated that thinning can promote the vitality of residual trees and reduce long term stress due to competition for water nutrients and light thinning can also increase the resilience and resistance of forest trees to severe drought stress and thus may be an effective approach to climate adaptation gebhardt et al 2014 grunicke et al 2020 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in addition thinning affects hydrological processes including evaporation transpiration rainfall partitioning soil water content and surface flow in vegetated ecosystems gebhardt et al 2014 del campo et al 2019 sun et al 2014 canopy interception which accounts for 5 40 of total rainfall is an important part of the shrub water cycle yue et al 2021 it determines the amount of net rainfall reaching the soil and is a key component in the hydrological cycle however few studies have explored practical strategies for managing highly dense shrublands with most focusing on forests grunicke et al 2020 sun et al 2015 in recent decades many observational studies have focused on canopy interception of shrubs in arid and semiarid areas at the individual plant scale an et al 2022 domingo et al 1998 jian et al 2018 li et al 2008 tonello et al 2021 yang et al 2019a yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 extrapolating the results of these studies to heterogeneous landscapes is a challenge in this context interception needs to be quantified at the stand or plot scale rather than at the individual plant scale due to plot level measurements of interception have the advantage that the results can be scaled up for example using traditional cover methods snyder et al 2022 furthermore plot level experimental results are generally applicable to a watershed and they cannot be confidently applied where conditions are markedly different particularly regarding rainfall regimes and vegetation types while interception models allow the extrapolation of measurements in space and time and can be used to predict the effects of climate and land cover change on water resources magliano et al 2022 therefore model simulations continue to be the main focus of vegetation canopy interception research widely used models for estimating interception losses are the original gash model and the revised version of this model muzylo et al 2009 the original gash model a simplified version of the rutter model gash 1979 rutter et al 1975 the gash model represents rainfall input as a series of discrete storms separated by intervals sufficiently long for the canopy and stems to dry completely this assumption is possible because of the rapid drying of forest canopies each storm is then divided into three subsequent phases canopy wetting up saturation and drying this separation emphasizes the relative importance of the climate against plant structure gash et al 1995 proposed the sparse versions of gash model to adjust the original model formulations to forest stands with significant open spaces between the tree canopies a crucial change is that in the sparse versions the evaporation rate from wetted surfaces is no longer calculated for the entire plot area but only for the area covered by the canopy this change overcame a poor boundary condition in the original models whereby the modeled canopy failed to wet up beyond a certain degree of sparseness as might be expected the gash sparse model gives better results than the original version in terms of modelling error 76 of the model applications resulted in errors below 10 with an important contribution of model performances with errors under 5 51 of the applications in contrast the gash original model the figure was 27 the better performance of the gash sparse model may be due to the conceptual changes introduced in this version but it may also be caused by many of the applications not being duly validated it should also be mentioned that the original version has mainly been applied to temperate climates whereas the sparse version has been applied mainly to tropical and semiarid climates also with good results deng et al 2022 herbst et al 2006 junqueira junior et al 2019 limousin et al 2008 ma et al 2019 2020 however this model has rarely been applied to shrubs compared to forests in semiarid areas the lack of research in this area can be attributed to the fact that evaporation from wet shrubland canopies unlike wet forest canopies is not a net water loss david et al 2005 and because of the difficult techniques of water flow measurement dunkerley 2000 domingo et al 1998 showed that interception models could be successfully applied to shrubs despite their structural differences from forests recently several studies have measured rainfall partitioning after changes in forest structure and derived interception parameters for model applications grunicke et al 2020 ma et al 2020 sun et al 2015 most of these studies have been based on measurement data only over several months one growing season or one year hence the model parameters are derived from very short datasets few long term studies i e 1 year have focused on shrub structural changes few long term studies i e 1 year have focused on the effect of structural changes in the shrubland canopy over time on interception loss the aims of this study were to 1 quantify the effects of vegetation changes on rainfall partitioning in control and thinned plots of two shrub species caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila and 2 clarify changes in interception processes using the revised gash model based on the determination of interception parameters with these aims in mind we conducted a 5 year experiment in which we measured rainfall partitioning in two re vegetated shrublands c korshinskii and s psammophila in the chinese loess plateau subjected to two thinning intensities moderate thinning mt and heavy thinning ht and no thinning nt the revised gash model modeled canopy interception losses in the control and thinned treatments this results of this study can help to predict and manage ecohydrological change in water limited ecosystems in the context of shifting shrub cover and climate conditions 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the liudaogou watershed 38 78 n 110 35 e 1 200 m altitude 6 89 km2 of shenmu county shaanxi province china fig 1 the watershed is located in an area of the loess plateau known as a water wind erosion crisscross region the climate in the region is mid temperate semiarid the average annual precipitation between 2003 and 2021 was 457 mm with approximately 83 of precipitation occurring between june and october the potential evaporation is 1 200 mm y 1 and the average annual temperature is 9 6 c january and july are the coldest and warmest with average monthly temperatures of 6 4 and 23 5 c respectively aeolian sandy soil and loess are typical soil types in this catchment two shrub species c korshinskii and s psammophila are widely planted for ecological restoration in the catchment rainfall and high temperature seasons are synchronized with plant growth in early april and plant senescence in late october the present experiment commenced in 2017 and monitoring continued until 2021 two plantations of c korshinskii 30 10 m and s psammophila 15 6 m on the level ground were selected each plot was further subdivided into three equal plots of 10 10 m and 5 6 m fig 1 c korshinskii and s psammophila were planted in 2013 and the average plant heights at the start of the study were 165 and 290 cm respectively both c korshinskii and s psammophila have an inverted cone canopy and are multi stemmed shrubs with no trunk or branches extending obliquely from the base in june 2019 for c korshinskii one plot was subjected to mt one was subjected to ht and one was left nt as a control likewise for s psammophila one plot was subjected to mt one was subjected to ht and one nt was left as a control fig 1 in the mt plots 25 of the branches were removed whereas 50 of the branches were removed in the ht plots all thinning operations were conducted by local villagers using branch shears to minimize soil disturbance on the plots all twigs and branches from the thinned shrubs were removed from the plots the number of branches in each plot post treatment is shown in fig 2 despite the significant difference in the number of branches base diameters in the three plots under the three various densities for two shrubs the frequency distribution was not significantly different 2 2 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements gross precipitation pg mm was measured using an onset onset computer corp bourne ma u s a rg3 m tipping bucket rain gauge 0 2 mm per tip located 3 m outside the plots in the study area as automatic rain gauges generally underestimate rainfall three manual rain gauges 20 cm diameter were placed around it for calibration and were read immediately after each rainfall event in this way rainfall characteristics such as the rainfall duration h and average rainfall intensity mm h 1 were calculated a rain event was defined as a period with 0 2 mm of total pg separated by at least 6 h without rain throughfall tf mm was measured using 13 rain gauges 20 cm diameter at each study plot to overcome spatial variability in tf the rain gauges at each plot were randomly placed every year the average tf was computed from all functioning rain gauges to reduce evaporative loss from the rain gauges tf was measured within 2 h after rainfall ended during the daytime to reduce evaporative loss from the rain gauges if a rainfall event ended at night tf was measured early the next morning stemflow sf mm was measured on 12 representative branches at each study plot with three branches from branch basal diameter bd categories of 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 18 mm sf was collected using aluminum foil collars each collar was fitted around the entire branch circumference and near the base of the branch and sealed with neutral silicone caulk fig 1 a 0 8 cm diameter pvc hose was used to guide the sf into a container fitted with a lid the collars and hoses were checked periodically for leaks and blockages respectively after obtaining these measurements sf was returned to the branch base to alleviate unnecessary drought stress on the sample branches the sf depth after each rainfall event was calculated in each shrub plot as follows 1 s f v i 1 n v i 1000 2 s f d s f v pa where sfv is the sf volume l of a plot after a rainfall event vi is the sf volume ml collected from individual stems in a plot n is the total number of stems in a plot sfd is the sf depth mm and pa is the plot area m2 the observed interception loss i mm was calculated using equation 3 3 i p g t f s f one way anova post hoc tukey s tests was used to recognize the significant differences p 0 05 in rainfall partitioning variables across treatments in the same year and the same treatments in different years statistical analysis was performed in spss ibm spss statistics version 25 0 2 3 revised gash analytical model 2 3 1 description of the model in the revised gash analytical model pg is expressed as a series of discrete rainfall events in which the canopy has sufficient time to dry before another rainfall event begins gash et al 1995 each rainfall event includes three phases wetting saturation and cessation the total canopy interception was obtained by summing the interception losses of the canopy during each phase of a rainfall event rainfall events were analyzed separately from a threshold value of pg to determine whether the canopy was saturated to calculate interception loss the revised analytical model incorporates two types of data canopy and climatic parameters the canopy parameters are the canopy storage capacity s canopy cover c free tf coefficient p calculated using equation 4 trunk storage capacity st and rainfall fraction diverted into sf pt the climatic parameters are pg mean evaporation rate e mm h 1 and mean rainfall intensity r mm h 1 during each rainfall event the amounts of rainwater required to saturate the canopy and trunk fully were calculated using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 p 1 c 5 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r 6 p t s t p t where pg and pt are the amounts of rainwater required to saturate the canopy and trunk fully respectively e c mm h 1 is the mean evaporation rate per unit area of canopy cover sc mm is the canopy storage capacity per unit area of cover the revised analytical model divides simulated interception loss into five components and the equation used to calculate each component is shown in table 1 2 3 2 estimation of the model parameters the s was obtained as a linear relationship between pg and the sum of tf and sf where the s was the value of pg when the sum of tf and sf was zero wallace mcjannet 2008 canopy cover was estimated using hemispherical photographs taken by fisheye webcams during the growing season and data were processed using can eye software version 6 3 niu et al 2021 weiss baret 2014 the st and pt were estimated using the method of gash and morton 1978 as the negative intercept and slope of the linear regression between pg and sf the e was estimated using the method of buttle and farnsworth 2012 and calculated using equation 7 7 e a r where a is the slope of the linear regression between pg and observed i for pg pg and r represents the mean rainfall intensity is 10 mm h 1 2 3 3 model evaluation the performance of the revised gash analytical model was evaluated using relative error re the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse metric nash sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse the re was the difference between the values estimated by the model and the measured values muzylo et al 2009 classified the performance of the interception rainfall model according to the re as follows poor re 30 fair 10 re 30 good 5 re 10 very good 1 re 5 and extremely good re 1 the nse measures the performance of each interception model as compared to the mean and can be used to assess the predictive power of the model the rmse was used to quantify the agreement between the measured data and the model predictions these three metrics are more suitable used to evaluate hydrological models 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the revised gash model five parameters s c pt st and e r were subjected to a sensitivity analysis in the analysis the values of these parameters were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values the simulated results were then compared with the actual measurement data the methodology in this study is further presented in a flowchart in fig 3 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the daily precipitation amounts intensities and durations for the 2017 2021 are shown in fig 4 in total 674 2 mm of precipitation occurred in 2017 637 2 mm in 2018 436 5 mm in 2019 359 3 mm in 2020 and 320 0 mm in 2021 according to the average annual precipitation 457 0 mm between 2003 and 2021 2017 and 2018 were classified as wet years whereas 2019 2020 and 2021 were classified as normal dry and extremely dry years respectively rainfall was unevenly distributed throughout the year with a mean of 88 0 occurring during the rainy season may october in 2017 2021 individual rainfall events ranged from 0 2 to 92 5 mm with an average of 7 6 mm the rainfall intensity ranged from 0 2 to 40 7 mm h 1 with an average of 4 2 mm h 1 the rainfall duration ranged from 0 1 to 26 6 h with an average of 3 1 h as shown in table 2 rainfall events 10 mm account for about 75 of the rainfall events during 2017 2021 and about 90 have rainfall intensities 10 mm h 1 the wet years are mainly characterized by a few more rainfall events 40 mm compared to the dry years during the experimental periods purple dashed lines fig 4a in the 5 years from 2017 to 2021 116 rainfall events were recorded with a total of 1 587 8 mm among them 780 4 mm 49 1 of total pg in the pre thinning period 2017 2018 and 807 4 mm 50 9 of total pg in the post thinning period 2019 2021 the frequency distributions of event size and intensity during the pre thinning and post thinning periods are shown in fig 5 generally small rainfall events low depths were more frequent and contributed to a lower total pg percentage than large rainfall events fig 5a c generally the event frequency of low intensity rainfall events range 0 5 mm h 1 was higher 50 of total events than the frequency of high intensity rainfall events in the pre thinning and post thinning periods fig 5b d this suggested that lower intensity rainfall events accounted for a higher percentage of total pg 3 2 rainfall partitioning measurements the changes in annual rainfall partitioning during the pre and post thinning periods are shown in fig 6 and table 3 in 2017 2018 before thinning there were no significant differences in the ratios of tf sf and i to pg in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots subjected to nt mt and ht in 2019 2021 after thinning both thinned plots had a higher tf rate than the plots subjected to nt fig 6a b in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots the tf rate increased by about 12 mt and 20 ht compared to the plots subjected to nt in contrast the sf and i rates significantly decreased with thinning intensity fig 6c d e f in the c korshinskii plots the total sf decreased by 21 mt and 49 ht and the total i decreased by 37 mt and 54 ht compared to the plot subjected to nt corresponding values for s psammophila were 31 mt and 50 ht for the sf rate and 29 mt and 50 ht for the i rate for both shrub species although the ratio of i to pg was highest under the nt treatment in 2021 the plots in the thinned treatments had already reached 68 5 mt and 48 6 ht of this value for c korshinskii 73 0 mt and 67 2 ht for s psammophila it is important to emphasize that in the plots subjected to ht the effects of the extremely dry year 2021 on total i cannot be determined the relationship between pg and canopy water balance tf sf and i based on rainfall event data is shown in fig 7 the event based canopy water balance amount increased linearly with pg p 0 01 the ratio of canopy water balance to pg varied greatly throughout the study period and stabilized gradually under rainfall events 20 mm 3 3 model parameterization model input parameters may provide insights into the quality of the model s performance and be useful in the model s result interpretation so they should be given priority consideration from the linear regressions of pg and rainfall partitioning components fig 6 the study derived the required parameter values in the revised gash model applied to the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots under nt mt and ht are shown in tables 4 and 5 the estimated canopy parameters s pai c pt and st and climatic parameter e gradually decreased as thinning intensity increased for example the s of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots decreased from 0 90 0 05 to 0 40 0 10 mm and the e decreased from 0 30 0 02 to 0 13 0 03 specifically the s pt and st values of c korshinskii were slightly larger than those of s psammophila in the plots under nt mt and ht parameters for the observed periods agree with the development of vegetation structure table 4 the thinning treatments reduced the measured parameters of vegetation structure plant area index pai and c to about 73 mt and 50 ht of the corresponding values of the control nt table 4 in 2017 2018 two wet years the relative pai increase rpai i i e the change in the pai divided by the initial pai was within 10 of all plots in 2019 2020 a normal and dry year respectively the rpai i declined to a lesser extent in the thinned plots mt and ht compared with the plots subjected to nt especially in the c korshinskii plots in 2021 under particularly dry conditions the degree of decrease in the rpai i of the plots subjected to ht was reduced by about half compared with that of the plots under nt and mt although the pai of the nt treatment was the highest in 2021 the plots on the thinned treatments had already reached about 85 mt and 70 ht of this value for two shrubs based on 5 years of measurement data there was a simple linear relationship between the pai values and canopy water balance of the two shrub plantations fig 8 according to the findings the tf rate decreased in accordance with an increase in the pai in the two shrub plantations whereas sf and i rates increased in accordance with an increase in the pai 3 4 rainfall interception modeling the performance of the revised gash model for the entire monitoring period 2017 2021 in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots subjected to nt is illustrated in fig 9 and table 6 comparing the simulated i with the measured values showed that the revised gash model severely underestimated i in wet years 2017 and 2018 especially in the presence of an individual rainfall event 40 mm such as that occurred in 2019 despite this classified as a normal year in dry years 2020 and 2021 when there were many individual rainfall events of 10 mm the revised gash model overestimated i applying the method proposed by muzylo et al 2009 the performance of the revised gash model in simulating i in both shrub plantations was classified as fair for both shrubs throughout the observation period poor in wet and extremely dry years and fair in normal and dry years but in 2020 dry year the performance of the revised model in simulating i by s psammophila was classified as very good in the nt mt and ht plots of c korshinskii and s psammophila individual rainfall events observed during june july and september of 2019 2021 were used to calibrate the revised gash model the calibrated models were then validated using measurements obtained in august and october 2019 2021 the measured and simulated total i according to the revised gash model are summarized in table 7 and plotted in fig 10 the i was underestimated to varying degrees in the calibration period such as in nt plots with underestimation of 3 0 for c korshinskii and 14 5 for s psammophila as the degree of thinning increased the degree of underestimation gradually increased in contrast to the results of the revised gash model in the calibration period in the validation period the revised model overestimated i with the degree of overestimation decreasing in accordance with the thinning intensity both root mean square error rmse and nse values gradually decreased with an increase in the thinning intensity in both the calibration and validation periods the performance of the revised gash model in all the plots varied from fair to good to very good with a re of 20 0 as shown in fig 10 the simulated values of individual rainfall events were slightly higher than the measured values when the rainfall amounts were small when the rainfall amounts were large the simulated values were lower than the measured values based on the correlation r2 of the simulated and observed values the validation period was slightly better than the calibration period fig 10 changes in interception components were compared in the six plots of the two shrub species fig 11 the sum of evaporation during and after rainfall consistently accounted for the largest component of estimated interception loss about 90 with an increase in the thinning intensity evaporation during rainfall gradually decreased in the c korshinskii plots from 51 6 to 42 9 but increased in the s psammophila plots from 55 1 to 57 1 in contrast evaporation after rainfall gradually increased in the c korshinskii plots from 37 4 to 44 8 but decreased in the s psammophila plots from 35 4 to 30 6 to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the revised gash model a sensitivity analysis of five parameters s c pt st and e r was conducted fig 12 e r and s were the most sensitive parameters in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots followed by c st and pt 4 discussion 4 1 thinning effects on rainfall partitioning the tf rate gradually increased while the sf and observed i rates decreased with increasing thinning intensity on an annual scale fig 6 although the gross amount of incident rainfall directly determines the magnitudes of tf and sf fig 7 and levels of saturation of canopy and stem surfaces carlyle moses 2004 levia et al 2010 many studies have shown that the factors affecting rainfall partitioning patterns include meteorological variables such as rainfall intensity air temperature and potential evapotranspiration crockford richardson 2000 llorens domingo 2007 staelens et al 2008 and the actual contributions are also dependent on vegetation composition and structure crockford richardson 2000 sadeghi et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 shrub structures e g canopy cover and stand density strongly affect variations in rainfall partitioning chang et al 2022 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 thinning alters the structures of shrub plots and can serve as an important method for regulating the redistribution of water resources in watersheds with shrubland cover thus examining changes in various components of the shrub water cycle such as transpiration and evapotranspiration as a result of thinning is important to improve understanding of the processes underlying changes in the water yield in the present study changes in rainfall partitioning due to thinning were consistent with a simple linear relationship between the pai and canopy water balance values of the two shrub plantations based on 5 years of measurement data fig 8 thus the linear relationship can be used as a useful tool for predicting net precipitation and observed i rates when the pai of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots was the same the tf rates of c korshinskii was significantly higher than that of s psammophila whereas the i rates of c korshinskii was significantly lower than that of s psammophila there was no significant difference in the sf rates of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots fig 8 however in studies conducted in regions with climatic variables similar to those in the present study when assessing at the individual plant level not the stand level the sf rate of c korshinskii was significantly higher than that of s psammophila and there was no significant difference in the tf rate yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2019b these findings can be explained by the canopy projection area of different shrubs the canopy projection area of c korshinskii is smaller than that of s psammophila in addition as the stand density increases the degree of overestimation of tf and underestimation of sf and i increases at the individual plant level as a result measurements of i at the individual plant level may underestimate results at the stand level at biome and global scales thus the role of rainfall partitioning in hydrological processes needs to be studied at the plant community level results from the 3 years after thinning of this study indicate that more heavily thinning treatments had more pronounced effects on shrub growth net precipitation and interception especially in dry years table 4 however the effects of thinning intensity are subject to the interplay among various factors when shrub plots become dense over time the canopy intercepts more rain potentially shortening the soil water recharge process snyder et al 2022 in water limited regions abiotic and biotic factors affect the soil water content vegetation depends on soil moisture and soil moisture is affected by water uptake by plants shading sf and i llorens domingo 2007 metzger et al 2017 rodriguez iturbe 2000 if a reduction in net precipitation sum of tf and sf is not balanced by a reduction in evaporation due to canopy shading high densities of shrubs may have a significant impact on the water budget of the respective ecosystem comparative studies of different thinning intensities can help us to determine the most suitable thinning method for shrub plots to reduce drought stress for example gebhardt et al 2014 indicated that repeated moderate thinning was a better option than the heavy thinning because of heavy thinning induced the progressive development of understory which not only competed for resources with trees but also hindered natural regeneration in this study the understory of s psammophila plot was sparse so its effects are expected to be minor still for c korshinskii plot the role of the understory in the longer term could become important affecting the difference between the two thinning treatments this further emphasizes the need to examine the long term effects of the thinning treatments in the two shrub plots in this study 4 2 interception parameters the s of the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots remained around or below 1 mm throughout the monitoring period table 4 which agrees well with findings obtained for other semiarid shrub species zhang et al 2018 the s of forests is significantly higher than that of shrubs in similar areas for example ma et al 2019 reported a s value of 1 34 for roinia pseudoacacia and 1 43 for pinus tabuliformis other studies reported that climatic variables e g rainfall intensity and wind speed and canopy traits e g cover height and leaf area index influenced s carlyle moses gash 2011 in this study sf was relatively low compared to the values obtained for other parts of rainfall partitioning in the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots table 4 the sf related parameters st and pt around 0 1 mm in two shrub plots were much lower than those reported by zhang et al 2018 0 55 mm for st and 0 68 mm for pt but measured sf rates agreed with those found in previous studies in semiarid regions yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2019b li et al 2008 yue et al 2021 in this study the observed mean values of st and pt were slightly higher in the c korshinskii plots than in the s psammophila plots these findings can be explained by the lower threshold of precipitation 0 9 mm for c korshinskii vs 2 1 mm for s psammophila and beneficial leaf traits of c korshinskii versus those of s psammophila yuan et al 2017 in the present study changes in canopy structure induced by thinning altered interception parameters e g s p and e thereby influencing i table 4 as reported previously the s and p also lead to spatial variability in tf loustau et al 1992 sun et al 2015 in this study in the three thinning years there was a greater reduction in s st and pt in the shrub plots subjected to nt and mt than ht during 2019 2021 p also increased under nt 0 25 and 0 13 for c korshinskii and s psammophila respectively and mt 0 10 and 0 08 for c korshinskii and s psammophila respectively with decreasing rainfall in the plots subjected to ht p slightly increased and remained at a high level 0 03 for both c korshinskii and s psammophila both light exposure and aerodynamic conductance of branches increase with an increase in canopy openness caused by thinning thus changing meteorological conditions such as temperature humidity and wind speed all of which control evaporation of water intercepted and stored within the canopy pypker et al 2005 the revised gash model performance 10 re 20 improved over the entire observation period compared to weaker gash model performance 24 re 84 for a single year table 4 fluctuations in model result from the years see fig 9 and table 6 reflect data availability within a single year rather than vegetation change generally the reliability of derived model parameters depends on the dataset i e measurement duration from which the parameters are obtained in this study the parameters derived from three different hydrological years normal dry and extremely dry yielded better simulation results than the parameters derived from only one type of hydrological year tables 6 and 7 this clearly shows that the performance of the revised gash analytical model depends on reliable parameterization including a range of parameters in the revised model from a large number of hydrological years can enable estimations of rainfall interception over time which can be used in shrub water balance studies in arid and semiarid regions 4 3 performance of the revised gash analytical model the revised gash analytical model provided good estimates of the total i in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots tables 6 and 7 and it also captured canopy density variation based on the rmse the revised gash model performed better after thinning than before in contrast the nse values were markedly better before thinning than after thinning table 7 this is not surprising as intensive thinning greatly reduces variability in i and tf and these models are not designed to measure rainfall events in the open field shinohara et al 2015 in terms of modeling error the underestimation of simulated total i using the revised gash model was similar under the nt treatment in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots table 6 and within the range reported by other studies fan et al 2014 fathizadeh et al 2018 junqueira junior et al 2019 limousin et al 2008 shinohara et al 2015 muzylo et al 2009 concluded that the expected modeling error in the prediction of interception loss can be as high as 20 in this study i was slightly overestimated in the control and thinned plots for small rainfall events during the calibration and validation periods for high rainfall events the predicted i was far from the 1 1 line in both the c korshinskii and s psammophila plots fig 10 the revised gash model severely underestimated i as rainfall increased fig 9 thus this model should be used with caution in areas with high rainfall events fathizadeh et al 2018 limousin et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 based on meteorological data collected using automatic rain gauges in the study area in the past ten years single rainfall events with heavy rainfall amounts 40 mm account for about 30 of the total rainfall therefore the effect of such rainfall events should be considered in future research to improve the performance of the model the thinning treatments altered the the interception components in the present study evaporation during storm events and the post storm period accounted for the largest amount of interception loss before and after thinning fig 11 which is consistent with the findings of previous studies sun et al 2015 ma et al 2019 2020 changes in s and e strongly affected i fig 12 the degree of decrease in the s of the c korshinskii plots under mt and ht relative to that under nt was smaller than the degree of decrease in e however in the s psammophila plots the decrease in the s of the plots subjected to mt and ht relative to that in the plot subjected to nt was greater than the decrease in e table 4 therefore s was the main cause of the decrease in i in the thinned plots of c korshinskii whereas the e was the main cause in the thinned plots of s psammophila quantification of interception components before and after thinning can help to improve understanding of changes in interception processes as well as underlying processes of peak flows infiltration and water resources in this ecosystem typically model error refers to the results of model validation rather than calibration muzylo et al 2009 this paper shows performance of the revised gash model in s psammophila plots than in c korshinskii plots during the validation period this indicates the revised gash model for interception loss modeling can be more appropriate for the s psammophila plots than for the c korshinskii plots in terms of re and nse values table 7 as noted in previous studies the revised version has been extensively applied in semiarid climates where sparse vegetation cover is common and performs well fan et al 2014 muzylo et al 2009 interception modeling is important for estimating the water balance and thus plays a crucial role in hydrological simulations and determining eco hydrological services junqueira junior et al 2019 future work should focus on operationalizing canopy interception models for routine use by shrub managers to optimize shrub management strategies 5 conclusions thinning increased net precipitation reaching the soil surface and reduced canopy interception in the plots subjected to ht significant effects of the extremely dry year could not be identified in rainfall partitioning measurements and canopy parameters such as the pai and s this suggests that ht allows both c korshinskii and s psammophila plots to adapt better to dry weather conditions the interception parameters s c pt st and e decreased with thinning intensity and changes in s and e strongly affected simulated i of note the decrease in simulated i in the thinned plots of c korshinskii was mainly caused by the s whereas it was mainly caused by the e in the s psammophila plots the revised analytical gash model provided a good estimate of the total i of the two shrub species re 20 however when evaluating the i of individual rainfall events the simulation ability and accuracy of the model decreased significantly with moderate overestimation of low rainfall events 10 mm and severe underestimation of high rainfall events 40 mm these over and underestimations were mainly caused by uncertainty in the input parameters using data from a type hydrological year or growing season to derive canopy parameters is not recommended parameters that can reliably estimate i can only be generated using data with varying rainfall amounts moreover as intensive thinning greatly reduces the variability in i the revised analytical gash model performed better after thinning than before thinning based on the re values although the effects of thinning on rainfall partitioning in this study lasted for three years the effective length of time for thinning remains to be addressed in addition further studies should also evaluate the effects of other important water cycle elements soil moisture transpiration etc to address the effects on the whole water cycle and to improve the implementation of tree plantations in water limited regions credit authorship contribution statement xiaotao niu conceptualization investigation methodology software visualization writing

2092,a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more water which consequently intensifies the hydrological cycle the projected increase in extreme precipitation has been associated with greater floods however most recent studies have argued that the reduced soil moisture could be causing the opposite effect we aim to understand how the hydrometeorological variables affect flood discharge and what the projections are for south america a vulnerable continent that has been barely studied regarding flood trends we used climate data from eta simulations nested in 4 global climate models besm canesm2 hadgem2 es miroc5 as input for the mgb sa hydrological model to yield flood discharge estimates then we were able to project the climate impacts on extreme precipitation antecedent soil moisture and flood discharge for large rivers 1 000 km2 and understand how these variables are related our results showed a strong sign that antecedent soil moisture is expected to be reduced in most of the continent except in southeastern south america sesa on the other hand there are mixed signs for rarer precipitation and a clear spatial pattern for 2 year precipitations rp2 which is expected to increase on the sesa and west amazon and decrease on central south america csa for basins 100 000 km2 results indicate a negative change sign for 2 year precipitations meaning that rainfall events that generate ordinary floods in large south american rivers are expected to decrease in the xxi century due to climate change the change signs for flood discharge and extreme precipitation are spatially similar but more basins show a decrease for flooding than for rainfall while only half of the south american basins are expected to present reduced 2 year precipitations nearly 70 of the rivers present a negative sign for 2 year floods which can be attributed to the reduced antecedent soil moisture keywords eta mgb flood discharge climate change extreme precipitation soil moisture data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are expected to increase due to global warming lenderink and fowler 2017 o gorman 2015 the clausius clapeyron relation indicates that a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more water vapor at a rate of 6 7 per degree celsius with more water in the atmosphere rarer storms are predicted to increase in magnitude raising its potential damage fischer and knutti 2016 myhre et al 2019 risser and wehner 2017 this effect is expected to be even more pronounced for sub daily and local precipitation events fowler et al 2021 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 prein et al 2017 which poses a great threat to vulnerable people living on urban impervious areas and hillslopes on the other hand droughts are predicted to be more recurrent and intense as well cook et al 2014 dai 2013 the relative humidity is expected to decrease with temperature increases over land especially in regions with limited moisture availability byrne and o gorman 2018 2016 denson et al 2021 reduced relative humidity inhibits convective formations yin et al 2018 affecting the precipitation volume over land and reinforcing the drier in dry and wetter in wet paradigm feng and zhang 2015 in addition the rise of temperature strengthens evapotranspiration in consequence it will reduce soil moisture and expand aridity asadi zarch et al 2017 samaniego et al 2018 which directly affects agriculture and water supply worldwide liu et al 2021 meza et al 2020 these climatic alterations also have an immediate impact on flooding at first it was expected that global warming would increase the flood frequency alfieri et al 2017 milly et al 2002 following the observed increases in extreme precipitation papalexiou and montanari 2019 sun et al 2021 however some recent results showed that increases in precipitation do not necessarily translate to increases in flood magnitude and an interesting debate has risen about this claim see do et al 2020 wasko et al 2019 wasko and sharma 2017 yin et al 2019 2018 sharma et al 2018 presented other flood drivers affected by global warming in addition to extreme precipitation such as reduced soil moisture earlier snowmelt and increased canopy storage capacity yu et al 2020 in particular flood intensity is highly sensitive to antecedent soil moisture blöschl et al 2015 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019 which is expected to decrease with climate change a drier soil can hold more water from rainfall thus reducing runoff and flood magnitude therefore projections of flood discharge will not necessarily present the same trend as extreme precipitation since there are other important flood drivers also affected by climate change in addition there is more confidence in the projected increase of fluvial flooding related to anticipated spring snowmelt than extreme precipitation blöschl et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2014 more investigation is necessary to understand how climate change may impact flooding as there are considerable regional differences between hydrographic basins extreme precipitation is increasing but not uniformly worldwide sun et al 2018 for example high latitude regions present storms intensification above the clausius clapeyron relation utsumi et al 2011 westra et al 2014 yin et al 2018 global scale investigations have also detected mixed and spatially complex flooding trends with different levels of grouping categories such as continents berghuijs et al 2017 do et al 2017 regions gudmundsson et al 2021 and climates zones do et al 2017 slater et al 2021 studies have found different trend signs for streamflow extremes using distinct statistical approaches and databases for instance do et al 2017 observed a negative trend in the usa while berghuijs et al 2017 observed a positive one in europe studies blöschl et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2021 currently converge to a tendency of more flooding in the north e g u k germany netherlands and less flooding in the south e g greece italy portugal however some continents such as south america have not been fully assessed on global studies due to the limited data record either for precipitation sun et al 2021 yin et al 2018 or floods do et al 2017 south america possesses large rivers systems for which it has been called the fluvial continent fleischmann et al 2021 kandus et al 2018 it contains great wetlands such as the pantanal and river inundations provide important ecosystem services in those places regulating biogeochemical processes junk et al 2013 in addition there are highly anthropized basins with large dams for hydropower generation such as the magdalena and la plata basins and climate change threatens the dams safety and the energy supply fluixá sanmartín et al 2018 da silva et al 2020 finally but not less important floods are one of the greatest natural hazards due to human settlements on floodplains people in south america have recently felt the impacts of extreme events cunha et al 2019 de abreu et al 2019 netto et al 2013 nobre et al 2016 and it is essential to investigate climate projections in such a vulnerable continent debortoli et al 2017 monte et al 2021 vörösmarty et al 2013 to avoid further disasters global climate models gcms are widely used tools to evaluate potential impacts of climate change donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 in particular assessing future alterations in the frequency of extreme events can benefit from downscaled simulations provided by regional climate models rcms as they have finer resolution than global ones and improved characterization of local features giorgi 2019 llopart et al 2020 regarding the south american domain the eta model mesinger et al 2012 is one of the most popular rcms for hydrological assessments especially in brazil borges de amorim and chaffe 2019 extreme precipitation indices e g precptot r99p r95p rx1day rx5day and cwd from eta have already been examined avila diaz et al 2020 chou et al 2014b dereczynski et al 2020 however these studies have barely covered the climate change impacts regarding hydrological extremes in south america in order to fill this gap this study provides a single integrated and standardized approach for hydrological assessment over the continent which is important for building comparisons between regions and understanding average changes and drivers of extreme flood events using a hydrological model forced with climate projections we can evaluate expected changes in flood discharge with a reasonable physical representation a previous assessment of streamflow extremes on a continental scale was conducted by ribeiro neto et al 2016 for brazilian basins but their hydrological model lacked a proper flood routing scheme which is crucial in large river basins in south america de paiva et al 2013 in this paper we use a hydrodynamic hydrological model for south america forced with projections from eta for the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios from cmip5 in this context the objective of this study is twofold first we investigate climate change impacts on extreme events in south america in terms of antecedent soil moisture precipitation and flood discharge at different spatial scales second we assess how projections of flood discharge are related to projected changes in its main drivers 2 methodology we assess climate change impacts on three hydrological variables flood discharge extreme precipitation and antecedent soil moisture biased corrected section 2 4 precipitation data were obtained from eta simulations section 2 3 nested in 4 global climate models gcm while flood discharge and soil moisture were simulated by the mgb sa hydrological model section 2 2 then we selected the maximum flood discharge and precipitation of each hydrological year for each river reach in the model finally a characteristic time was estimated based on flow propagation to identify the soil moisture prior to a flood event and to define the duration of extreme precipitation events section 2 5 the analysis was built on comparing the historical 1961 2005 and future 2021 2065 estimates of the highest second highest and median values of the annual maximum precipitation and discharge these estimates correspond to the 44 rp44 22 rp22 and 2 years rp2 return period events respectively according to the weibull plotting position formula weibull 1939 the relative differences and the change sign increasing positive and decreasing negative between historical and future periods were accessed for every downscaled climate model and all river reaches catchments from the hydrological model this assessment was made for each hydrological variable individually extreme precipitation section 3 1 antecedent soil moisture section 3 2 and flood discharge section 3 3 finally we investigate how the projected changes on these variables are related section 3 4 2 1 the hydrology of south america south america occupies only 12 of the earth s land surface but is responsible for 30 of the water flowing to the oceans clark et al 2015 it contains the 1st and 5th largest basins in the world amazon and la plata mainly formed by the uruguay and paraná river basins fig 1 a and the 1st and 4th largest rivers by discharge amazon and orinoco respectively as nearly 80 of the continent lies within the tropics most of the basins are dominated by a hot and humid climate that drives highly frequent convective rainfalls especially around the equator nevertheless south america presents some climate diversity such as the semi arid in eastern south america esa a large area with less than 1000 mm of rainfall per year fig 1 b which depends on the são francisco river for water supply a polar climate in parts over the andes cordillera especially in the higher altitudes and an extremely dry climate at the peruvian and atacama deserts located mostly on northern chile veblen et al 2007 the andes cordillera is an important topographic barrier on the west part of the continent which extends between the northern and southern tips 10 n 55 s with altitudes above 4 km in some areas garreaud et al 2009 fig 1 c it has a direct effect on the air circulation causing considerable high orographic rainfalls especially on the western amazon and conducting moisture from the amazon to the southeastern south america sesa alejandro martinez and dominguez 2014 espinoza et al 2020 concomitantly the andes cordillera blocks the atmospheric moisture flow creating a rain shadow effect and establishing dry climates over the peruvian and atacama deserts and eastern patagonia as patagonia exhibits a negative rainfall gradient from the andes towards the east the discharge regime of most patagonian rivers is dominated by snowmelt from the headwater streams pasquini and depetris 2007 however this article does not discuss results from these regions due to hydrological modeling limitations 2 2 the mgb sa hydrological model mgb sa is a continental scale semi distributed hydrological hydrodynamic model developed for integrated simulation of large south american basins siqueira et al 2018 the model is discretized in unit catchments each one divided into hydrological response units hru with similar characteristics of soil and vegetation the water balance is calculated over a single soil layer i e a bucket model for every unit catchment and hru at a daily time step evapotranspiration is based on the penman monteith equation surface subsurface and groundwater runoff are sent to linear reservoirs to simulate catchment delay before flowing to the main river flow routing in the main channel is computed using a 1d local inertia hydrodynamic model which also accounts for infiltration from flooded areas into the unsaturated soil column in floodplains there is no simulation of snow melting processes in the mgb sa which does not compromise the results since runoff generation is governed by rainfall in most regions of south america see the previous section regarding the model setup the drainage network is discretized in 15 km long river reaches which produces over 30 000 unit catchments for the whole continent with upstream areas 1000 km2 the mgb sa was calibrated using as input the daily precipitation data from the mswep v1 database beck et al 2017 and climatological data from the climate research unity cru global climate v 2 new et al 2002 the climate variables from cru database used as input for mgb sa simulations were temperature wind speed air relative humidity atmospheric pressure and shortwave radiation which are used internally to calculate evapotranspiration the mgb sa discharge outputs were validated at hundred gauge stations and presented nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 6 for over 55 of the gauges outperforming global hydrological models it has also performed satisfactorily for other hydrological variables such as evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage which were compared to remote sensing data and reanalysis products siqueira et al 2018 therefore this model becomes suitable to represent different climate scenarios as addressed in this paper krysanova et al 2018 2 3 the eta regional climate model eta is an atmospheric model mesinger 1984 with a long history of applications and developments by the brazilian national institute for spatial research inpe for central and south america despite being initially built for numerical weather predictions chou et al 2000 it has been recently adapted for regional climate studies marengo et al 2012 its name eta relates to the vertical coordinate η which creates a quasi horizontal surface and prevents pressure gradient forces errors that can be significant on steep regions such as the andes cordillera mesinger et al 2012 the eta model covers the central and south american continents from latitude 50os to 14 4on and longitude 84 2ow to 31 6ow it has a horizontal resolution of 20 km and 38 vertical levels we use the eta model nested in 4 gcms besm nobre et al 2013 canesm2 chylek et al 2011 hadgem2 es collins et al 2011 and miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 the gcms provide sea surface temperature estimates lateral boundary conditions of the state variables and initial conditions of soil moisture and temperature chou et al 2014b we evaluated 2 representative concentration pathways rcp from cmip5 taylor et al 2012 rcp4 5 thomson et al 2011 and rcp8 5 riahi et al 2011 which correspond to a reasonable controlled and a high emission scenario respectively the scenarios are named after the expected increase in the radiative forcing for the end of the xxi century due to greenhouse gases ghg emissions 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 respectively the eta output data from the historical 1961 2005 and future 2021 2065 periods were bias corrected and used as inputs to the hydrological model 2 4 bias correction bias correction is a post processing step to approximate the simulated data to reality as models have inherent and systematic errors however bias correction methods often introduce inconsistencies as they modify the spatiotemporal covariance structure of the climate models and ignore the feedbacks among variables ehret et al 2012 maraun 2016 the choice of a method for bias correction is one of the greatest sources of uncertainty especially for extreme precipitation iizumi et al 2017 and in some cases the impact of bias correction uncertainty is higher than the climate signal itself hagemann et al 2011 nevertheless streamflow is extremely sensitive to precipitation and systematic errors on such input variable can drastically impact hydrological simulations kavetski et al 2006 sperna weiland et al 2015 thus using a bias correction method becomes strictly necessary in order to reproduce realistic hydrographs muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2012 several bias correction methods have been described and tested in the literature maraun 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2012 among those quantile mapping is one of the most adopted approaches for precipitation bias correction of hydrological impact assessments hempel et al 2013 pandey et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 the quantile mapping method consists in matching the cumulative distribution function cdf of simulated and observed data from the historical period and project it for the future and can be symbolized by the following equation p sim f obs 1 f sim p sim where f sim is the cdf of the simulated data from the historical period f obs 1 refers to the inverse cdf of the observed data from the same historical period p sim is the simulated variable and p sim is the bias corrected variable we have used an empirical quantile mapping method with limited linear extrapolation restriction f sim p 1 for removing bias of precipitation for the remaining climate variables used as input to the hydrological model e g temperature wind speed we adopted a linear scaling approach teutschbein and seibert 2012 we used daily data from the mswep v2 2 product beck et al 2019 as our reference precipitation and the cru database as the reference for other atmospheric variables 2 5 characteristic time flood wave travel time in order to adequately relate flood discharge and its respective drivers antecedent soil moisture and precipitation it is necessary to match the time scale of the hydrometeorological events that lead to floods for example the duration of a precipitation event must be compatible with the catchment size and its response time daily precipitation can be adequate for catchments up to 1 000 or even 10 000 km2 but for larger catchments floods are usually caused by rainfall events of longer duration thus we propose adopting a characteristic time tc to allow comparisons between flood discharge extreme precipitation and antecedent soil moisture we obtained tc by calculating the flood wave travel time through the catchment mainstream the drainage network of the mgb sa model is discretized in equal reaches of 15 km length section 2 2 we estimated the flood wave travel time for every river reach considering the reach s length and the speed of a kinematic wave c d q d a δ q δ v δ x where q is the discharge a is the wetted area and v is the stored volume over a river reach of δ x length the kinematic wave celerity depends on the magnitude of the flood so we estimated tc by considering a reference discharge with a 2 year return period using the mgb sa simulated time series of q and v then we divided the reaches lengths 15 km by the calculated wave celerity c to obtain a traveling time per river reach finally to estimate the catchment tc we propagated the flood wave from upstream to downstream adding traveling time increments from river reaches and keeping the value from the larger river at confluences fig 2 demonstrates the estimated tc for the modeled river reaches in south america for example the flood wave travel time for the amazon river is about 56 days and for the paraná river 35 days because mgb sa s drainage network includes water bodies where intermittent rivers or potentially no river exist especially in arid regions we filtered out river reaches that the mean annual precipitation upstream is below 600 mm yr 1 to ensure spatial and temporal consistency in the assessment we developed a procedure to calculate both antecedent soil moisture and extreme precipitation at the level of river reaches based on tc first we calculated the average precipitation upstream of a river reach with a duration of tc days and then computed the maximum value for each year further the values of antecedent soil moisture were estimated by the average upstream soil moisture exactly tc days before the maximum simulated discharge of a given year note that the maximum precipitation event is not necessarily related to the maximum discharge while the antecedent soil moisture is then extreme precipitation and antecedent soil moisture were computed for every river reach and each year within the historical and future periods this approach enabled us to perform direct comparisons by evaluating changes in signal between extreme discharges precipitation and antecedent soil moisture 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation the analysis for extreme precipitation is associated with the river discharge and the accumulated rainfall over a catchment see section 2 5 fig 3 demonstrates the spatial arrangement of the extreme precipitation change sign through the drainage network it is important to remark that the colors are related to the change sign of extreme precipitation for the whole river basin upstream to the river reaches fig 3 presents the relative differences between the future and historical period for the rcp4 5 scenario more specifically the upper left column and lower center column limits of the models ensemble and the agreement between the 4 downscaled climate models besm canesm2 hadgem2 es miroc5 regarding the change sign right column this evaluation is made for the 2 and 22 year return period events firstly one can observe a considerable difference in spatial consistency between the 22 year rp22 and 2 year rp2 precipitation the spatial arrangement of rp2 is clearer and more delineated this can be explained by two main reasons i large uncertainty for the rp22 due to a relatively small sample size 44 years ii uncertainties related to the bias correction method since the largest precipitation values are on the upper tail of the cdf curve results from the 4 downscaled climate models indicate future increases of extreme precipitation for the uruguay basin located in southeastern south america for other rivers such as tocantins são francisco magdalena and paraguay right branch river of the paraná basin the simulations indicate a projected reduction for the rp2 but there is no clear sign for rp22 in other words very extreme precipitation might increase in those basins but the magnitude of recurrent annual extreme precipitation is expected to decrease in addition a positive change can also be noted in the western amazon the results presented for extreme precipitation of high frequency rp2 is similar to what was found for long term mean precipitation in other studies brêda et al 2020 ribeiro neto et al 2016 sorribas et al 2016 to provide insights on how changes in extreme precipitation are linked to the analyzed spatial scale fig 4 shows boxplots of relative differences between the historical and future rcp4 5 scenario periods according to the catchment size extreme precipitation is one of the most problematic variables to be evaluated in climate impact assessments due to extrapolations of the cdf curve cannon et al 2015 some authors have proposed alternative methods of bias correction focused on precipitation extremes maity et al 2019 mamalakis et al 2017 which are slightly more effective but also more complex we present results that have not been bias corrected fig 4a in order to understand the impact of this procedure in general bias correction did not compromise the sign and range of the boxplots except for the 44 year return period precipitation rp44 on relatively small basins 1 000 km2 in this case the bias correction method has reduced the boxplot interquartile range limiting precipitation differences and hiding the positive sign of rp44 despite that we can see that the sample medians are always close to 0 but for the rarer events rp22 and rp44 the medians are slightly positive for basins smaller than 100 000 km2 for basins 100 000 km2 results indicate a negative change sign especially for rp2 meaning that rainfall events that generate ordinary floods in large south american rivers are expected to decrease in the xxi century due to climate change in conclusion we can see that extreme precipitation will respond differently to global warming depending on its geographical location its intensity and the respective catchment size rp2 is expected to decrease on central and eastern south america but there is no clear sign for the rarer precipitations rp22 and rp44 this means that in some places average annual extreme precipitation rp2 might be reduced but rarer precipitations might be more intense this statement can be endorsed by fig 4 as the sample median of rp22 and rp44 is often greater than the sample median of rp2 in addition there is a clear difference in the sign of extreme precipitation between medium to large catchments 1 000 to 100 000 km2 and very large catchments 100 000 km2 this can be explained by the assumptions made for extreme precipitation as the duration of such events was given by a characteristic time i e flood wave travel time for very large catchments extreme precipitation lasts from days to weeks and is averaged over a considerably large area representing a completely different process than short and local precipitations the negative sign on very large catchments agrees with other studies that have concluded that convective rainfall is supposed to become more intense with global warming however they will present higher increases for shorter durations lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 and smaller spatial extent wasko et al 2016 3 2 soil moisture flood events depend not only on intense rainfalls but also on the initial conditions of the soil in this article the antecedent soil moisture refers to the catchment average soil saturation degree prior to an annual maximum discharge see section 2 5 fig 5 shows change signs from four mgb sa simulations each one forced with eta outputs nested in a different gcm besm canesm2 hadgem2 es miroc5 in general projected changes in antecedent soil moisture from both ghg emissions scenarios are similar results show a predominant negative sign north of 20os a transitional zone around 25os and a positive sign on southeastern south america for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 however there is a smaller agreement among rcp4 5 simulations orange on the orinoco basin western amazon and paraguay basin while the negative sign from the rcp8 5 simulations is stronger red for the paraná basin the negative sign of the northern catchments is predominant over the wetter regions south of 20os as the main river maintains the red color even near the river mouth the results shown on fig 5 are demarcated in fig 6 in terms of catchment area overall the soil saturation degree prior to an extreme discharge event is lower in future scenarios especially for rcp8 5 in addition it was observed no difference in the antecedent soil saturation degree for different catchment sizes in theory a general reduction of soil moisture is expected since higher temperatures intensify evapotranspiration our results agree with the literature that points to drier soil in the future due to global warming samaniego et al 2018 wasko and nathan 2019 there is a positive change sign only in southeastern south america most likely because this region is expected to become wetter brêda et al 2020 chou et al 2014a zaninelli et al 2019 and this precipitation increase will have a stronger impact on the soil moisture compared to the projected evapotranspiration increase 3 3 flood discharge to assess to what extent climate change will impact floods in south american rivers we performed projections of annual maximum discharge fig 7 shows the relative differences of simulated flood discharges for the historical and future periods it also shows the upper and lower limits of the mgb sa simulations ensemble one simulation for each driven gcm and how many members out of 4 agree about the change sign in regions where more ensemble members agree on the change sign projections should be more reliable the spatial arrangement of flood discharge signs generally follows extreme precipitation results but projected changes in floods present a clearer delineation and distinction between regions the maps in fig 7 show a predominant negative sign in central and eastern south america and a positive sign in southeastern south america and western amazon even for the upper limit of mgb sa simulations some rivers such as the são francisco and the tocantins are projected to face severe reduction over 20 for their average annual maximum discharge rp2 southern tributaries of the amazon river are also expected to reduce flood magnitude the paraná basin seems to be a transition zone presenting a negative sign for the northern tributaries and positive sign for the southern tributaries as for extreme precipitation a subtle difference between the change signs of rp2 and rp22 can be observed for flood discharges this can be explained by the randomness of rarer events and the limited sample size 44 years for estimating the return period for example the paraná and magdalena rivers present a negative sign for rp2 but no clear sign for rp22 however studies have provided some evidence that less extreme flood events are expected to decrease particularly in larger catchments while rarer floods are likely to become more intense sharma et al 2018 so it is possible that some regions indeed present opposing signs for rp2 and rp22 fig 8 summarizes the results for estimated climate impacts on flood discharge overall results suggest a reduction of extreme discharge for most catchments in south america as the boxplot medians are negative however climate change apparently has a different impact on ordinary floods 2 year return period and extraordinary floods 22 year return period in scenario rcp4 5 66 of the catchments present a negative sign for rp2 while only 60 and 59 present a negative sign for rp22 and rp44 respectively these numbers increase to 75 69 and 68 respectively on the scenario rcp8 5 therefore at least in 7 of the catchments it is likely that rarer floods up to a return period of 44 years will become more intense while the average annual maximum discharge is expected to decrease also there were slight differences related to the catchment sizes very large catchments are more likely to present extreme discharge reductions than medium to large catchments this is mostly explained by the climate impact on extreme precipitation see section 3 1 as the projected changes for antecedent soil moisture do not depend on the catchment size section 3 2 do et al 2017 already have observed decreasing trends in floods with catchment size the authors have detected a positive trend only for groups of catchments smaller than 400 km2 which were not assessed in this article due to the discretization of the hydrological model area threshold of 1 000 km2 and the eta cell size 400 km2 thus our results partially support previous findings the model outcomes point to a general reduction of extreme discharges in south america also there are a few regions where the average annual maximum discharge is expected to decrease while greater floods are expected to increase these outcomes agree with previous studies that claim floods will decrease due to global warming especially because of reduced soil moisture do et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 wasko and nathan 2019 wasko and sharma 2017 it also agrees to some extent with observed trends of extreme events in brazil wasko et al 2021 on the other hand it contradicts hirabayashi et al 2021 which projected extreme discharge using gcms outputs and concluded that floods will increase in magnitude for most south american river basins although hirabayashi et al 2021 have used a larger return period for their evaluation 100 years it is unlikely that their results would be significantly different for 44 year floods 3 4 flood drivers analysis finally we aim to connect the outcomes described in the previous sections through a graphical contingency table fig 9 considering results from all 4 climate models and all catchments in fig 9 the size of the circles represents the number of catchments in a sample and their color indicates the percentage of catchments with a positive negative sign for rp2 discharge the y axis is associated with the change sign of rp2 precipitation p while the x axis refers to the change sign of the median antecedent soil moisture w that can be either positive negative or neutral 0 whereas neutral means a relative difference between present and future within 5 and 5 for example given that rp2 precipitation is supposed to increase in the future p and the antecedent soil moisture is supposed to decrease w 60 to 70 of the catchments will present a negative change sign for flood discharge in the rcp4 5 scenario symbolized by the darkish yellow color on the top left corner in this example the size of the circle indicates that nearly 15 000 catchments present p and w signs simultaneously this contingency table reflects the influence of flood drivers it can be observed that the largest circles are on the bottom left corner colored in dark red this position on the contingency table indicates a negative sign for rp2 precipitation and antecedent soil moisture p w and its color means that in most catchments flood discharge will be reduced in such conditions on the other hand the smallest circles are in the bottom right corner p w with a light color light blue for rcp4 5 and light orange for rcp8 5 which indicates a similar number of rivers with positive and negative signs for flood discharge on the top right corner rp2 precipitation and antecedent soil moisture present a positive sign p w and consequently is also expected an increase in flood discharge dark blue these results indicate that when p and w present the same sign it is very likely that flood discharge will follow the same change some considerations can be made on the size of the circles a circles colored from dark yellow to red are larger than those in blue which means that rp2 discharge will decrease in the future for most catchments b the number of catchments that present p p0 and p are approximately the same sum of columns c the circles of column w are smaller than circles of column w thus antecedent soil moisture will be reduced for most catchments overall while there is no clear change sign for extreme precipitation flood discharge and antecedent soil moisture are expected to decrease this suggests that the reduced soil moisture is the main responsible for negative change signs of rp2 discharge on the top line p the circles have similar sizes which means that when rp2 precipitation is expected to increase there is no indication of what will happen to antecedent soil moisture however when rp2 precipitation is expected to decrease p it is expected a reduction in antecedent soil moisture w for most of the catchments or a neutral sign w0 at least this reinforces the projections of drier soils as w can equally present a negative sign even if extreme precipitation is expected to increase in other words the negative effects of higher temperatures and consequently greater evaporation might surpass the positive effect of increased precipitation on the soil moisture in nearly half of the cases number of p w number of p w in addition there are small differences between the climate scenarios mainly related to antecedent soil moisture for example circles in column w for the rcp4 5 scenario are smaller than those in w for the rcp8 5 scenario this can be explained by the higher temperatures expected for rcp8 5 which will intensify evaporation and consequently reduce the soil moisture more than the rcp4 5 scenario finally we can see that for a p w condition 60 to 70 70 to 80 of the catchments will present a negative sign for flood discharge and for a p w condition 50 to 60 40 to 50 of the catchments will present a positive sign on scenario rcp4 5 rcp8 5 these results imply that the sign of antecedent soil moisture is predominant over the sign of rp2 precipitation in most cases we can take the same conclusions when analyzing neutral signs p0 and w0 our findings agree with other studies that show that antecedent soil moisture is the main driver of recurrent annual floods ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 at least for river basins of 1000 km2 or larger however we cannot extend our conclusions to rarer floods as a more detailed analysis would be necessary 4 conclusions global warming is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle at a global scale projected intensification of extreme rainfall generally led to the suggestion that floods would also increase however more recent analyses showed that projected changes in floods are less straightforward than initially thought the climate alterations present different impacts on floods for different regions of the world and depend on processes like antecedent soil moisture and the size of the river basins in this paper we assessed climate change impacts in antecedent soil moisture extreme precipitation and flood discharge in large catchments 1 000 km2 of south america and evaluated how these projections are related the antecedence of soil moisture and the duration of the extreme rainfall events are given by the characteristic time of the respective catchment which can vary from one day to a few weeks we used outputs from a regional climate model eta nested in four global models and a continental scale hydrologic hydrodynamic model for the analysis there is a clear indication of reduced soil moisture for most of south america due to global warming as suggested in the literature sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 for the rcp8 5 scenario the reductions of soil moisture are even more pronounced due to higher increases in temperature we observed a positive change sign in soil moisture only in southeastern south america sesa as this region is expected to become significantly more humid brêda et al 2020 zaninelli et al 2019 in general the average annual maximum precipitation is expected to increase in western amazon and sesa and decrease mainly in central south america csa especially in the são francisco and tocantins basins for rarer precipitation events over 20 years of return period a clear spatial pattern in the change sign was not detected probably because of the greater randomness of rarer events and the small sample size 45 years for frequency analysis nevertheless catchments over 100 000 km2 were shown to be more susceptible to negative signs for extreme precipitation suggesting that extreme rainfall events that lead to floods in large rivers are expected to decrease in south america the spatial arrangement of the change signs of flood discharge is similar to extreme precipitation there is also a positive sign in sesa and western amazon and a negative sign in csa and eastern south america which outlines the influence of extreme precipitation in floods however the number of catchments exhibiting a negative sign for flood discharge was larger than that for extreme precipitation while the fraction of catchments showing positive negative signs was 50 50 for extreme precipitation this relation moved to 30 70 for flood discharge this can be attributed to the projected reduction of soil moisture in most of south america when the average annual maximum precipitation and antecedent soil moisture present different change signs it is more likely that the average annual maximum discharge follows the same sign as soil moisture over 60 of the time in addition there were slight differences related to the frequency of flood events although for most of the catchments in south america the maximum rp44 and median rp2 simulated floods presented a reduced magnitude in the future period at least in 10 of the cases there is a positive sign for the maximum flood despite a negative sign for the median annual flood however because i there was a limited sample size for the distribution function 45 years and ii we used a bias removal method that affects the precipitation maxima we cannot be sure if these change signs would remain negative for even rarer floods e g 100 or 1 000 years return period credit

2092,a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more water which consequently intensifies the hydrological cycle the projected increase in extreme precipitation has been associated with greater floods however most recent studies have argued that the reduced soil moisture could be causing the opposite effect we aim to understand how the hydrometeorological variables affect flood discharge and what the projections are for south america a vulnerable continent that has been barely studied regarding flood trends we used climate data from eta simulations nested in 4 global climate models besm canesm2 hadgem2 es miroc5 as input for the mgb sa hydrological model to yield flood discharge estimates then we were able to project the climate impacts on extreme precipitation antecedent soil moisture and flood discharge for large rivers 1 000 km2 and understand how these variables are related our results showed a strong sign that antecedent soil moisture is expected to be reduced in most of the continent except in southeastern south america sesa on the other hand there are mixed signs for rarer precipitation and a clear spatial pattern for 2 year precipitations rp2 which is expected to increase on the sesa and west amazon and decrease on central south america csa for basins 100 000 km2 results indicate a negative change sign for 2 year precipitations meaning that rainfall events that generate ordinary floods in large south american rivers are expected to decrease in the xxi century due to climate change the change signs for flood discharge and extreme precipitation are spatially similar but more basins show a decrease for flooding than for rainfall while only half of the south american basins are expected to present reduced 2 year precipitations nearly 70 of the rivers present a negative sign for 2 year floods which can be attributed to the reduced antecedent soil moisture keywords eta mgb flood discharge climate change extreme precipitation soil moisture data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are expected to increase due to global warming lenderink and fowler 2017 o gorman 2015 the clausius clapeyron relation indicates that a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more water vapor at a rate of 6 7 per degree celsius with more water in the atmosphere rarer storms are predicted to increase in magnitude raising its potential damage fischer and knutti 2016 myhre et al 2019 risser and wehner 2017 this effect is expected to be even more pronounced for sub daily and local precipitation events fowler et al 2021 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 prein et al 2017 which poses a great threat to vulnerable people living on urban impervious areas and hillslopes on the other hand droughts are predicted to be more recurrent and intense as well cook et al 2014 dai 2013 the relative humidity is expected to decrease with temperature increases over land especially in regions with limited moisture availability byrne and o gorman 2018 2016 denson et al 2021 reduced relative humidity inhibits convective formations yin et al 2018 affecting the precipitation volume over land and reinforcing the drier in dry and wetter in wet paradigm feng and zhang 2015 in addition the rise of temperature strengthens evapotranspiration in consequence it will reduce soil moisture and expand aridity asadi zarch et al 2017 samaniego et al 2018 which directly affects agriculture and water supply worldwide liu et al 2021 meza et al 2020 these climatic alterations also have an immediate impact on flooding at first it was expected that global warming would increase the flood frequency alfieri et al 2017 milly et al 2002 following the observed increases in extreme precipitation papalexiou and montanari 2019 sun et al 2021 however some recent results showed that increases in precipitation do not necessarily translate to increases in flood magnitude and an interesting debate has risen about this claim see do et al 2020 wasko et al 2019 wasko and sharma 2017 yin et al 2019 2018 sharma et al 2018 presented other flood drivers affected by global warming in addition to extreme precipitation such as reduced soil moisture earlier snowmelt and increased canopy storage capacity yu et al 2020 in particular flood intensity is highly sensitive to antecedent soil moisture blöschl et al 2015 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019 which is expected to decrease with climate change a drier soil can hold more water from rainfall thus reducing runoff and flood magnitude therefore projections of flood discharge will not necessarily present the same trend as extreme precipitation since there are other important flood drivers also affected by climate change in addition there is more confidence in the projected increase of fluvial flooding related to anticipated spring snowmelt than extreme precipitation blöschl et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2014 more investigation is necessary to understand how climate change may impact flooding as there are considerable regional differences between hydrographic basins extreme precipitation is increasing but not uniformly worldwide sun et al 2018 for example high latitude regions present storms intensification above the clausius clapeyron relation utsumi et al 2011 westra et al 2014 yin et al 2018 global scale investigations have also detected mixed and spatially complex flooding trends with different levels of grouping categories such as continents berghuijs et al 2017 do et al 2017 regions gudmundsson et al 2021 and climates zones do et al 2017 slater et al 2021 studies have found different trend signs for streamflow extremes using distinct statistical approaches and databases for instance do et al 2017 observed a negative trend in the usa while berghuijs et al 2017 observed a positive one in europe studies blöschl et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2021 currently converge to a tendency of more flooding in the north e g u k germany netherlands and less flooding in the south e g greece italy portugal however some continents such as south america have not been fully assessed on global studies due to the limited data record either for precipitation sun et al 2021 yin et al 2018 or floods do et al 2017 south america possesses large rivers systems for which it has been called the fluvial continent fleischmann et al 2021 kandus et al 2018 it contains great wetlands such as the pantanal and river inundations provide important ecosystem services in those places regulating biogeochemical processes junk et al 2013 in addition there are highly anthropized basins with large dams for hydropower generation such as the magdalena and la plata basins and climate change threatens the dams safety and the energy supply fluixá sanmartín et al 2018 da silva et al 2020 finally but not less important floods are one of the greatest natural hazards due to human settlements on floodplains people in south america have recently felt the impacts of extreme events cunha et al 2019 de abreu et al 2019 netto et al 2013 nobre et al 2016 and it is essential to investigate climate projections in such a vulnerable continent debortoli et al 2017 monte et al 2021 vörösmarty et al 2013 to avoid further disasters global climate models gcms are widely used tools to evaluate potential impacts of climate change donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 in particular assessing future alterations in the frequency of extreme events can benefit from downscaled simulations provided by regional climate models rcms as they have finer resolution than global ones and improved characterization of local features giorgi 2019 llopart et al 2020 regarding the south american domain the eta model mesinger et al 2012 is one of the most popular rcms for hydrological assessments especially in brazil borges de amorim and chaffe 2019 extreme precipitation indices e g precptot r99p r95p rx1day rx5day and cwd from eta have already been examined avila diaz et al 2020 chou et al 2014b dereczynski et al 2020 however these studies have barely covered the climate change impacts regarding hydrological extremes in south america in order to fill this gap this study provides a single integrated and standardized approach for hydrological assessment over the continent which is important for building comparisons between regions and understanding average changes and drivers of extreme flood events using a hydrological model forced with climate projections we can evaluate expected changes in flood discharge with a reasonable physical representation a previous assessment of streamflow extremes on a continental scale was conducted by ribeiro neto et al 2016 for brazilian basins but their hydrological model lacked a proper flood routing scheme which is crucial in large river basins in south america de paiva et al 2013 in this paper we use a hydrodynamic hydrological model for south america forced with projections from eta for the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios from cmip5 in this context the objective of this study is twofold first we investigate climate change impacts on extreme events in south america in terms of antecedent soil moisture precipitation and flood discharge at different spatial scales second we assess how projections of flood discharge are related to projected changes in its main drivers 2 methodology we assess climate change impacts on three hydrological variables flood discharge extreme precipitation and antecedent soil moisture biased corrected section 2 4 precipitation data were obtained from eta simulations section 2 3 nested in 4 global climate models gcm while flood discharge and soil moisture were simulated by the mgb sa hydrological model section 2 2 then we selected the maximum flood discharge and precipitation of each hydrological year for each river reach in the model finally a characteristic time was estimated based on flow propagation to identify the soil moisture prior to a flood event and to define the duration of extreme precipitation events section 2 5 the analysis was built on comparing the historical 1961 2005 and future 2021 2065 estimates of the highest second highest and median values of the annual maximum precipitation and discharge these estimates correspond to the 44 rp44 22 rp22 and 2 years rp2 return period events respectively according to the weibull plotting position formula weibull 1939 the relative differences and the change sign increasing positive and decreasing negative between historical and future periods were accessed for every downscaled climate model and all river reaches catchments from the hydrological model this assessment was made for each hydrological variable individually extreme precipitation section 3 1 antecedent soil moisture section 3 2 and flood discharge section 3 3 finally we investigate how the projected changes on these variables are related section 3 4 2 1 the hydrology of south america south america occupies only 12 of the earth s land surface but is responsible for 30 of the water flowing to the oceans clark et al 2015 it contains the 1st and 5th largest basins in the world amazon and la plata mainly formed by the uruguay and paraná river basins fig 1 a and the 1st and 4th largest rivers by discharge amazon and orinoco respectively as nearly 80 of the continent lies within the tropics most of the basins are dominated by a hot and humid climate that drives highly frequent convective rainfalls especially around the equator nevertheless south america presents some climate diversity such as the semi arid in eastern south america esa a large area with less than 1000 mm of rainfall per year fig 1 b which depends on the são francisco river for water supply a polar climate in parts over the andes cordillera especially in the higher altitudes and an extremely dry climate at the peruvian and atacama deserts located mostly on northern chile veblen et al 2007 the andes cordillera is an important topographic barrier on the west part of the continent which extends between the northern and southern tips 10 n 55 s with altitudes above 4 km in some areas garreaud et al 2009 fig 1 c it has a direct effect on the air circulation causing considerable high orographic rainfalls especially on the western amazon and conducting moisture from the amazon to the southeastern south america sesa alejandro martinez and dominguez 2014 espinoza et al 2020 concomitantly the andes cordillera blocks the atmospheric moisture flow creating a rain shadow effect and establishing dry climates over the peruvian and atacama deserts and eastern patagonia as patagonia exhibits a negative rainfall gradient from the andes towards the east the discharge regime of most patagonian rivers is dominated by snowmelt from the headwater streams pasquini and depetris 2007 however this article does not discuss results from these regions due to hydrological modeling limitations 2 2 the mgb sa hydrological model mgb sa is a continental scale semi distributed hydrological hydrodynamic model developed for integrated simulation of large south american basins siqueira et al 2018 the model is discretized in unit catchments each one divided into hydrological response units hru with similar characteristics of soil and vegetation the water balance is calculated over a single soil layer i e a bucket model for every unit catchment and hru at a daily time step evapotranspiration is based on the penman monteith equation surface subsurface and groundwater runoff are sent to linear reservoirs to simulate catchment delay before flowing to the main river flow routing in the main channel is computed using a 1d local inertia hydrodynamic model which also accounts for infiltration from flooded areas into the unsaturated soil column in floodplains there is no simulation of snow melting processes in the mgb sa which does not compromise the results since runoff generation is governed by rainfall in most regions of south america see the previous section regarding the model setup the drainage network is discretized in 15 km long river reaches which produces over 30 000 unit catchments for the whole continent with upstream areas 1000 km2 the mgb sa was calibrated using as input the daily precipitation data from the mswep v1 database beck et al 2017 and climatological data from the climate research unity cru global climate v 2 new et al 2002 the climate variables from cru database used as input for mgb sa simulations were temperature wind speed air relative humidity atmospheric pressure and shortwave radiation which are used internally to calculate evapotranspiration the mgb sa discharge outputs were validated at hundred gauge stations and presented nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 6 for over 55 of the gauges outperforming global hydrological models it has also performed satisfactorily for other hydrological variables such as evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage which were compared to remote sensing data and reanalysis products siqueira et al 2018 therefore this model becomes suitable to represent different climate scenarios as addressed in this paper krysanova et al 2018 2 3 the eta regional climate model eta is an atmospheric model mesinger 1984 with a long history of applications and developments by the brazilian national institute for spatial research inpe for central and south america despite being initially built for numerical weather predictions chou et al 2000 it has been recently adapted for regional climate studies marengo et al 2012 its name eta relates to the vertical coordinate η which creates a quasi horizontal surface and prevents pressure gradient forces errors that can be significant on steep regions such as the andes cordillera mesinger et al 2012 the eta model covers the central and south american continents from latitude 50os to 14 4on and longitude 84 2ow to 31 6ow it has a horizontal resolution of 20 km and 38 vertical levels we use the eta model nested in 4 gcms besm nobre et al 2013 canesm2 chylek et al 2011 hadgem2 es collins et al 2011 and miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 the gcms provide sea surface temperature estimates lateral boundary conditions of the state variables and initial conditions of soil moisture and temperature chou et al 2014b we evaluated 2 representative concentration pathways rcp from cmip5 taylor et al 2012 rcp4 5 thomson et al 2011 and rcp8 5 riahi et al 2011 which correspond to a reasonable controlled and a high emission scenario respectively the scenarios are named after the expected increase in the radiative forcing for the end of the xxi century due to greenhouse gases ghg emissions 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 respectively the eta output data from the historical 1961 2005 and future 2021 2065 periods were bias corrected and used as inputs to the hydrological model 2 4 bias correction bias correction is a post processing step to approximate the simulated data to reality as models have inherent and systematic errors however bias correction methods often introduce inconsistencies as they modify the spatiotemporal covariance structure of the climate models and ignore the feedbacks among variables ehret et al 2012 maraun 2016 the choice of a method for bias correction is one of the greatest sources of uncertainty especially for extreme precipitation iizumi et al 2017 and in some cases the impact of bias correction uncertainty is higher than the climate signal itself hagemann et al 2011 nevertheless streamflow is extremely sensitive to precipitation and systematic errors on such input variable can drastically impact hydrological simulations kavetski et al 2006 sperna weiland et al 2015 thus using a bias correction method becomes strictly necessary in order to reproduce realistic hydrographs muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2012 several bias correction methods have been described and tested in the literature maraun 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2012 among those quantile mapping is one of the most adopted approaches for precipitation bias correction of hydrological impact assessments hempel et al 2013 pandey et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 the quantile mapping method consists in matching the cumulative distribution function cdf of simulated and observed data from the historical period and project it for the future and can be symbolized by the following equation p sim f obs 1 f sim p sim where f sim is the cdf of the simulated data from the historical period f obs 1 refers to the inverse cdf of the observed data from the same historical period p sim is the simulated variable and p sim is the bias corrected variable we have used an empirical quantile mapping method with limited linear extrapolation restriction f sim p 1 for removing bias of precipitation for the remaining climate variables used as input to the hydrological model e g temperature wind speed we adopted a linear scaling approach teutschbein and seibert 2012 we used daily data from the mswep v2 2 product beck et al 2019 as our reference precipitation and the cru database as the reference for other atmospheric variables 2 5 characteristic time flood wave travel time in order to adequately relate flood discharge and its respective drivers antecedent soil moisture and precipitation it is necessary to match the time scale of the hydrometeorological events that lead to floods for example the duration of a precipitation event must be compatible with the catchment size and its response time daily precipitation can be adequate for catchments up to 1 000 or even 10 000 km2 but for larger catchments floods are usually caused by rainfall events of longer duration thus we propose adopting a characteristic time tc to allow comparisons between flood discharge extreme precipitation and antecedent soil moisture we obtained tc by calculating the flood wave travel time through the catchment mainstream the drainage network of the mgb sa model is discretized in equal reaches of 15 km length section 2 2 we estimated the flood wave travel time for every river reach considering the reach s length and the speed of a kinematic wave c d q d a δ q δ v δ x where q is the discharge a is the wetted area and v is the stored volume over a river reach of δ x length the kinematic wave celerity depends on the magnitude of the flood so we estimated tc by considering a reference discharge with a 2 year return period using the mgb sa simulated time series of q and v then we divided the reaches lengths 15 km by the calculated wave celerity c to obtain a traveling time per river reach finally to estimate the catchment tc we propagated the flood wave from upstream to downstream adding traveling time increments from river reaches and keeping the value from the larger river at confluences fig 2 demonstrates the estimated tc for the modeled river reaches in south america for example the flood wave travel time for the amazon river is about 56 days and for the paraná river 35 days because mgb sa s drainage network includes water bodies where intermittent rivers or potentially no river exist especially in arid regions we filtered out river reaches that the mean annual precipitation upstream is below 600 mm yr 1 to ensure spatial and temporal consistency in the assessment we developed a procedure to calculate both antecedent soil moisture and extreme precipitation at the level of river reaches based on tc first we calculated the average precipitation upstream of a river reach with a duration of tc days and then computed the maximum value for each year further the values of antecedent soil moisture were estimated by the average upstream soil moisture exactly tc days before the maximum simulated discharge of a given year note that the maximum precipitation event is not necessarily related to the maximum discharge while the antecedent soil moisture is then extreme precipitation and antecedent soil moisture were computed for every river reach and each year within the historical and future periods this approach enabled us to perform direct comparisons by evaluating changes in signal between extreme discharges precipitation and antecedent soil moisture 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation the analysis for extreme precipitation is associated with the river discharge and the accumulated rainfall over a catchment see section 2 5 fig 3 demonstrates the spatial arrangement of the extreme precipitation change sign through the drainage network it is important to remark that the colors are related to the change sign of extreme precipitation for the whole river basin upstream to the river reaches fig 3 presents the relative differences between the future and historical period for the rcp4 5 scenario more specifically the upper left column and lower center column limits of the models ensemble and the agreement between the 4 downscaled climate models besm canesm2 hadgem2 es miroc5 regarding the change sign right column this evaluation is made for the 2 and 22 year return period events firstly one can observe a considerable difference in spatial consistency between the 22 year rp22 and 2 year rp2 precipitation the spatial arrangement of rp2 is clearer and more delineated this can be explained by two main reasons i large uncertainty for the rp22 due to a relatively small sample size 44 years ii uncertainties related to the bias correction method since the largest precipitation values are on the upper tail of the cdf curve results from the 4 downscaled climate models indicate future increases of extreme precipitation for the uruguay basin located in southeastern south america for other rivers such as tocantins são francisco magdalena and paraguay right branch river of the paraná basin the simulations indicate a projected reduction for the rp2 but there is no clear sign for rp22 in other words very extreme precipitation might increase in those basins but the magnitude of recurrent annual extreme precipitation is expected to decrease in addition a positive change can also be noted in the western amazon the results presented for extreme precipitation of high frequency rp2 is similar to what was found for long term mean precipitation in other studies brêda et al 2020 ribeiro neto et al 2016 sorribas et al 2016 to provide insights on how changes in extreme precipitation are linked to the analyzed spatial scale fig 4 shows boxplots of relative differences between the historical and future rcp4 5 scenario periods according to the catchment size extreme precipitation is one of the most problematic variables to be evaluated in climate impact assessments due to extrapolations of the cdf curve cannon et al 2015 some authors have proposed alternative methods of bias correction focused on precipitation extremes maity et al 2019 mamalakis et al 2017 which are slightly more effective but also more complex we present results that have not been bias corrected fig 4a in order to understand the impact of this procedure in general bias correction did not compromise the sign and range of the boxplots except for the 44 year return period precipitation rp44 on relatively small basins 1 000 km2 in this case the bias correction method has reduced the boxplot interquartile range limiting precipitation differences and hiding the positive sign of rp44 despite that we can see that the sample medians are always close to 0 but for the rarer events rp22 and rp44 the medians are slightly positive for basins smaller than 100 000 km2 for basins 100 000 km2 results indicate a negative change sign especially for rp2 meaning that rainfall events that generate ordinary floods in large south american rivers are expected to decrease in the xxi century due to climate change in conclusion we can see that extreme precipitation will respond differently to global warming depending on its geographical location its intensity and the respective catchment size rp2 is expected to decrease on central and eastern south america but there is no clear sign for the rarer precipitations rp22 and rp44 this means that in some places average annual extreme precipitation rp2 might be reduced but rarer precipitations might be more intense this statement can be endorsed by fig 4 as the sample median of rp22 and rp44 is often greater than the sample median of rp2 in addition there is a clear difference in the sign of extreme precipitation between medium to large catchments 1 000 to 100 000 km2 and very large catchments 100 000 km2 this can be explained by the assumptions made for extreme precipitation as the duration of such events was given by a characteristic time i e flood wave travel time for very large catchments extreme precipitation lasts from days to weeks and is averaged over a considerably large area representing a completely different process than short and local precipitations the negative sign on very large catchments agrees with other studies that have concluded that convective rainfall is supposed to become more intense with global warming however they will present higher increases for shorter durations lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 and smaller spatial extent wasko et al 2016 3 2 soil moisture flood events depend not only on intense rainfalls but also on the initial conditions of the soil in this article the antecedent soil moisture refers to the catchment average soil saturation degree prior to an annual maximum discharge see section 2 5 fig 5 shows change signs from four mgb sa simulations each one forced with eta outputs nested in a different gcm besm canesm2 hadgem2 es miroc5 in general projected changes in antecedent soil moisture from both ghg emissions scenarios are similar results show a predominant negative sign north of 20os a transitional zone around 25os and a positive sign on southeastern south america for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 however there is a smaller agreement among rcp4 5 simulations orange on the orinoco basin western amazon and paraguay basin while the negative sign from the rcp8 5 simulations is stronger red for the paraná basin the negative sign of the northern catchments is predominant over the wetter regions south of 20os as the main river maintains the red color even near the river mouth the results shown on fig 5 are demarcated in fig 6 in terms of catchment area overall the soil saturation degree prior to an extreme discharge event is lower in future scenarios especially for rcp8 5 in addition it was observed no difference in the antecedent soil saturation degree for different catchment sizes in theory a general reduction of soil moisture is expected since higher temperatures intensify evapotranspiration our results agree with the literature that points to drier soil in the future due to global warming samaniego et al 2018 wasko and nathan 2019 there is a positive change sign only in southeastern south america most likely because this region is expected to become wetter brêda et al 2020 chou et al 2014a zaninelli et al 2019 and this precipitation increase will have a stronger impact on the soil moisture compared to the projected evapotranspiration increase 3 3 flood discharge to assess to what extent climate change will impact floods in south american rivers we performed projections of annual maximum discharge fig 7 shows the relative differences of simulated flood discharges for the historical and future periods it also shows the upper and lower limits of the mgb sa simulations ensemble one simulation for each driven gcm and how many members out of 4 agree about the change sign in regions where more ensemble members agree on the change sign projections should be more reliable the spatial arrangement of flood discharge signs generally follows extreme precipitation results but projected changes in floods present a clearer delineation and distinction between regions the maps in fig 7 show a predominant negative sign in central and eastern south america and a positive sign in southeastern south america and western amazon even for the upper limit of mgb sa simulations some rivers such as the são francisco and the tocantins are projected to face severe reduction over 20 for their average annual maximum discharge rp2 southern tributaries of the amazon river are also expected to reduce flood magnitude the paraná basin seems to be a transition zone presenting a negative sign for the northern tributaries and positive sign for the southern tributaries as for extreme precipitation a subtle difference between the change signs of rp2 and rp22 can be observed for flood discharges this can be explained by the randomness of rarer events and the limited sample size 44 years for estimating the return period for example the paraná and magdalena rivers present a negative sign for rp2 but no clear sign for rp22 however studies have provided some evidence that less extreme flood events are expected to decrease particularly in larger catchments while rarer floods are likely to become more intense sharma et al 2018 so it is possible that some regions indeed present opposing signs for rp2 and rp22 fig 8 summarizes the results for estimated climate impacts on flood discharge overall results suggest a reduction of extreme discharge for most catchments in south america as the boxplot medians are negative however climate change apparently has a different impact on ordinary floods 2 year return period and extraordinary floods 22 year return period in scenario rcp4 5 66 of the catchments present a negative sign for rp2 while only 60 and 59 present a negative sign for rp22 and rp44 respectively these numbers increase to 75 69 and 68 respectively on the scenario rcp8 5 therefore at least in 7 of the catchments it is likely that rarer floods up to a return period of 44 years will become more intense while the average annual maximum discharge is expected to decrease also there were slight differences related to the catchment sizes very large catchments are more likely to present extreme discharge reductions than medium to large catchments this is mostly explained by the climate impact on extreme precipitation see section 3 1 as the projected changes for antecedent soil moisture do not depend on the catchment size section 3 2 do et al 2017 already have observed decreasing trends in floods with catchment size the authors have detected a positive trend only for groups of catchments smaller than 400 km2 which were not assessed in this article due to the discretization of the hydrological model area threshold of 1 000 km2 and the eta cell size 400 km2 thus our results partially support previous findings the model outcomes point to a general reduction of extreme discharges in south america also there are a few regions where the average annual maximum discharge is expected to decrease while greater floods are expected to increase these outcomes agree with previous studies that claim floods will decrease due to global warming especially because of reduced soil moisture do et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 wasko and nathan 2019 wasko and sharma 2017 it also agrees to some extent with observed trends of extreme events in brazil wasko et al 2021 on the other hand it contradicts hirabayashi et al 2021 which projected extreme discharge using gcms outputs and concluded that floods will increase in magnitude for most south american river basins although hirabayashi et al 2021 have used a larger return period for their evaluation 100 years it is unlikely that their results would be significantly different for 44 year floods 3 4 flood drivers analysis finally we aim to connect the outcomes described in the previous sections through a graphical contingency table fig 9 considering results from all 4 climate models and all catchments in fig 9 the size of the circles represents the number of catchments in a sample and their color indicates the percentage of catchments with a positive negative sign for rp2 discharge the y axis is associated with the change sign of rp2 precipitation p while the x axis refers to the change sign of the median antecedent soil moisture w that can be either positive negative or neutral 0 whereas neutral means a relative difference between present and future within 5 and 5 for example given that rp2 precipitation is supposed to increase in the future p and the antecedent soil moisture is supposed to decrease w 60 to 70 of the catchments will present a negative change sign for flood discharge in the rcp4 5 scenario symbolized by the darkish yellow color on the top left corner in this example the size of the circle indicates that nearly 15 000 catchments present p and w signs simultaneously this contingency table reflects the influence of flood drivers it can be observed that the largest circles are on the bottom left corner colored in dark red this position on the contingency table indicates a negative sign for rp2 precipitation and antecedent soil moisture p w and its color means that in most catchments flood discharge will be reduced in such conditions on the other hand the smallest circles are in the bottom right corner p w with a light color light blue for rcp4 5 and light orange for rcp8 5 which indicates a similar number of rivers with positive and negative signs for flood discharge on the top right corner rp2 precipitation and antecedent soil moisture present a positive sign p w and consequently is also expected an increase in flood discharge dark blue these results indicate that when p and w present the same sign it is very likely that flood discharge will follow the same change some considerations can be made on the size of the circles a circles colored from dark yellow to red are larger than those in blue which means that rp2 discharge will decrease in the future for most catchments b the number of catchments that present p p0 and p are approximately the same sum of columns c the circles of column w are smaller than circles of column w thus antecedent soil moisture will be reduced for most catchments overall while there is no clear change sign for extreme precipitation flood discharge and antecedent soil moisture are expected to decrease this suggests that the reduced soil moisture is the main responsible for negative change signs of rp2 discharge on the top line p the circles have similar sizes which means that when rp2 precipitation is expected to increase there is no indication of what will happen to antecedent soil moisture however when rp2 precipitation is expected to decrease p it is expected a reduction in antecedent soil moisture w for most of the catchments or a neutral sign w0 at least this reinforces the projections of drier soils as w can equally present a negative sign even if extreme precipitation is expected to increase in other words the negative effects of higher temperatures and consequently greater evaporation might surpass the positive effect of increased precipitation on the soil moisture in nearly half of the cases number of p w number of p w in addition there are small differences between the climate scenarios mainly related to antecedent soil moisture for example circles in column w for the rcp4 5 scenario are smaller than those in w for the rcp8 5 scenario this can be explained by the higher temperatures expected for rcp8 5 which will intensify evaporation and consequently reduce the soil moisture more than the rcp4 5 scenario finally we can see that for a p w condition 60 to 70 70 to 80 of the catchments will present a negative sign for flood discharge and for a p w condition 50 to 60 40 to 50 of the catchments will present a positive sign on scenario rcp4 5 rcp8 5 these results imply that the sign of antecedent soil moisture is predominant over the sign of rp2 precipitation in most cases we can take the same conclusions when analyzing neutral signs p0 and w0 our findings agree with other studies that show that antecedent soil moisture is the main driver of recurrent annual floods ivancic and shaw 2015 sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 at least for river basins of 1000 km2 or larger however we cannot extend our conclusions to rarer floods as a more detailed analysis would be necessary 4 conclusions global warming is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle at a global scale projected intensification of extreme rainfall generally led to the suggestion that floods would also increase however more recent analyses showed that projected changes in floods are less straightforward than initially thought the climate alterations present different impacts on floods for different regions of the world and depend on processes like antecedent soil moisture and the size of the river basins in this paper we assessed climate change impacts in antecedent soil moisture extreme precipitation and flood discharge in large catchments 1 000 km2 of south america and evaluated how these projections are related the antecedence of soil moisture and the duration of the extreme rainfall events are given by the characteristic time of the respective catchment which can vary from one day to a few weeks we used outputs from a regional climate model eta nested in four global models and a continental scale hydrologic hydrodynamic model for the analysis there is a clear indication of reduced soil moisture for most of south america due to global warming as suggested in the literature sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 for the rcp8 5 scenario the reductions of soil moisture are even more pronounced due to higher increases in temperature we observed a positive change sign in soil moisture only in southeastern south america sesa as this region is expected to become significantly more humid brêda et al 2020 zaninelli et al 2019 in general the average annual maximum precipitation is expected to increase in western amazon and sesa and decrease mainly in central south america csa especially in the são francisco and tocantins basins for rarer precipitation events over 20 years of return period a clear spatial pattern in the change sign was not detected probably because of the greater randomness of rarer events and the small sample size 45 years for frequency analysis nevertheless catchments over 100 000 km2 were shown to be more susceptible to negative signs for extreme precipitation suggesting that extreme rainfall events that lead to floods in large rivers are expected to decrease in south america the spatial arrangement of the change signs of flood discharge is similar to extreme precipitation there is also a positive sign in sesa and western amazon and a negative sign in csa and eastern south america which outlines the influence of extreme precipitation in floods however the number of catchments exhibiting a negative sign for flood discharge was larger than that for extreme precipitation while the fraction of catchments showing positive negative signs was 50 50 for extreme precipitation this relation moved to 30 70 for flood discharge this can be attributed to the projected reduction of soil moisture in most of south america when the average annual maximum precipitation and antecedent soil moisture present different change signs it is more likely that the average annual maximum discharge follows the same sign as soil moisture over 60 of the time in addition there were slight differences related to the frequency of flood events although for most of the catchments in south america the maximum rp44 and median rp2 simulated floods presented a reduced magnitude in the future period at least in 10 of the cases there is a positive sign for the maximum flood despite a negative sign for the median annual flood however because i there was a limited sample size for the distribution function 45 years and ii we used a bias removal method that affects the precipitation maxima we cannot be sure if these change signs would remain negative for even rarer floods e g 100 or 1 000 years return period credit

2093,recent climate change and more intensive human activities have induced significant changes in streamflow along the middle reaches of the yellow river basin mryrb which has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community however most previous studies have focused on changes in annual streamflow by examining data from a small number of hydrological stations and the role of the various human activities remains unclear here we used an extended budyko based framework that considered changes in soil water storage δs to determine the contributions of changes in streamflow both at the annual and seasonal scale these analysis were conducted on 40 catchments and three sections toudaoguai longmen tdg lm longmen huayuankou lm hyk and toudaoguai huayuankou tdg hyk in the mryrb from 1971 to 2015 results showed that streamflow at most catchments and sections declined dramatically after years of abrupt change detected by the pettitt test with decreases occurring at a faster rate during flood seasons 42 9 than during non flood seasons 31 8 although human behaviors were often the main cause of streamflow reductions at the annual and seasonal scales the effects of δs became more important at increasingly finer scales indeed they were of equal or greater importance than human impacts in some catchments with corresponding relative contributions up to 48 the effects of human activities may possibly have been overestimated or underestimated by 1 16 in three sections when the impact of δs was not considered further analysis indicated that human water use particularly the rapid increase in water withdrawals for domestic purposes electricity generation and manufacturing was the primary factor among human activities that affected streamflow reduction in the lm hyk and tdg hyk sections at different timescales comprising 60 90 of all impacts by contrast the effects of water use and other human factors were almost equal in the tdg lm section among the other human factors vegetation restoration played a more critical role in the tdg lm section whereas the construction of check dams was more important in the lm hyk section these findings of our study can enhance the understanding of hydrological changes in response to environmental factors keywords seasonal streamflow changes attribution human water use vegetation restoration changes in soil water storage yellow river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction much research has shown that streamflow in major rivers around the world has experienced noticeable changes over various time scales being driven by both climate change and human activities haddeland et al 2014 li et al 2020 messager et al 2021 oki and kanae 2006 padrón et al 2020 climate change causes variations in streamflow by altering the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation and evaporation rates in a region donohue et al 2012 kabir et al 2022 kraaijenbrink et al 2021 liang et al 2015 concurrently human activities can either amplify or minimize the effects of climate induced changes in streamflow by forest management evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 singh and basu 2022 dam and reservoir construction patterson et al 2013 veldkamp et al 2017 and extraction of water flörke et al 2018 long et al 2020 therefore identifying the different roles of climate change and human activities in streamflow changes is critical for sustainable management of water resources and understanding of fundamental hydrological processes the yellow river basin is the largest river basin in northern china and plays a vital role in the country s development while the basin sustains a population of 114 million people it only holds 3 of the country s water resources wang et al 2019b however the impacts of climate change and intensifying human influences have led to a significant decline in streamflow in many sub basins within this region over the past 60 years luan et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhan et al 2014 indeed during the 1990s the lower reaches of the mainstream dried up tang et al 2013 which has severe implications for sustainable development of the yellow river basin the water use was close to or even exceeded the amount of water available due to population growth expanding irrigated croplands and economic development cheng et al 2009 qi et al 2022 the disparity between water demand and water supply will likely intensify in the future yin et al 2017 the chinese government recently emphasized the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin thus one of the essential tasks for researchers is to detect streamflow changes and explore their driving mechanisms which is a prerequisite for better managing water resources many workers have studied the relative importance of factors driving streamflow change in the yellow river basin by either performing physical hydrological models or applying statistical methods for example lv et al 2018 estimated the effects of climate and land surface change on natural streamflow with consideration of precipitation intensity wang et al 2020 assessed the impacts of climate change and human activities on various streamflow signatures at four hydrological stations in the yellow river basin these studies mostly used the gauging station along the mainstream with few hydrological stations some other researchers have focused on the typical catchments in this region such as the dali river zhang et al 2021b yan river xu et al 2013 and wei river chang et al 2015 gao et al 2020 despite these efforts the apparent spatial variations in climatic conditions and the intensity of human activity in this area makes it necessary to explore regional differences in the response of hydrological processes due to the poor performance of streamflow simulations for the yellow river basin particularly in the middle catchments and that the time consuming parameters calibration processes in hydrological models wang et al 2020 most previous studies have favored the application of statistical methods by using the outlet hydrological stations of the catchment one such statistical method is the budyko based framework which can avoid the transformation and interaction processes of various elements within the catchment budyko 1974 trancoso et al 2016 wang et al 2015 and so interpret hydrological behaviors from a system focused perspective it thus has been widely applied in areas characterized by intense human activities for example zhao et al 2014 and liang et al 2015 evaluated the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes in the middle parts of the yellow river based on the budyko framework as streamflow changes can be affected by many factors that vary at different spatial scales studies that consider hydrological data from a large number of stations can provide more insightful advances in understanding how streamflow responds to various driving forces bao et al 2019 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 nevertheless while most of these prior studies have focused mainly on changes in annual streamflow rapid development in the yellow river basin infers that it is necessary to assess how these factors influence streamflow at a finer timescale recently wu et al 2016 conducted a contribution analysis of changes in seasonal streamflow yet the soil water storage changes were ignored which maybe underestimated or overestimated the effects of climate change human activities moreover the impacts of different human behaviors in the yellow river basin remain unclear the overall objective of our study was therefore to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to changes in annual and seasonal streamflow over the last 45 years which we achieved by using an extended budyko method that considered changes in soil water storage this assessment was based on streamflow series observed from 40 catchments and three sections in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin mryrb meanwhile we also examined the impacts of direct human water use by using the global water withdrawals dataset and explored the relative importance of check dams and vegetation restoration in different sections of the river 2 materials 2 1 study area this study focused on the mryrb which is located between the toudaoguai and huayuankou hydrological stations fig 1 there are more than 40 tributaries in this section which contribute nearly 44 of the total discharge of the yellow river zhao et al 2014 the area has an apparent semiarid climate and varied seasons the annual average precipitation is 420 mm 1960 2010 with more than 60 of the total precipitation occurring from june to september in the form of high intensity storms zhao et al 2013 rapid development of the region s socio economy profile in recent decades has been supported by annual water withdrawals that increased from 13 7 billion m3 in 1998 to 17 2 billion m3 in 2015 in the mryrb https yrcc gov cn other hhgb which represents a 26 increase in volume in addition vegetation coverage has been dramatically improved following the implementation of a series of ecological conservation projects bryan et al 2018 fu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a which altered local hydrological processes the combined effects of climate change and human disturbances have caused streamflow in the region to significantly decrease during the past few decades which has hindered high quality development of the yellow river basin therefore it is necessary to quantify the individual impacts that climate change and various human factors have had on the changes in streamflow at different timescales in this region based on available streamflow datasets from 1971 to 2015 we selected 40 catchments which encompass a variety of hydro meteorological conditions land surface types and physical characteristics see table 1 and fig 2 we also divided the mryrb into three sections delimited by the toudaoguai longmen and huayuankou hydrological stations i e toudaoguai longmen tdg lm longmen huayuankou lm hyk and toudaoguai huayuankou tdg hyk in

provided by the shaanxi province soil and water conservation environment monitoring center with the increase of the sediment deposition check dam would be fully deposited or even destroyed by the frequently occurring floods thereby having relatively less impact on streamflow reduction liang et al 2015 here the lifetime of the check dam was assumed to be 15 years and its storage was assumed to decrease linearly over time since it began to operate which allowed us to calculate its total capacity and storage each year 3 method 3 1 detection of streamflow breakpoints the pettitt breakpoint test pettitt 1979 has been widely used to identify the breakpoint of meteorological and hydrological variables in this work we applied this method to detect the abrupt changes in a time series of observed streamflow 40 catchments and three sections at annual and seasonal timescales during the study period table 1 based on the pettitt test we divided the study period into two periods period 1 prior to and including breakpoint year and period 2 after breakpoint year 3 2 attribution method based on the extended budyko model the budyko type method can express the nonlinear relationships between streamflow and its influencing factors and is usually applied to examine the separate impacts of climate change and human activities on the annual streamflow changes in the study we adopted fu s equation fu 1981 which introduced a dimensionless parameter ω to represent the comprehensive effects of catchment characteristics such as vegetation land use climate seasonality and human water withdrawal donohue et al 2007 liu et al 2022 vora and singh 2021 1 et p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p ω 1 ω where p is precipitation mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm and e 0 is the potential evaporation mm many previous studies of annual streamflow attribution assumed that water storage does not change liang et al 2015 tang and wang 2021 wang et al 2019a however at shorter timescales e g at the seasonal scale water storage dynamics are not negligible chen et al 2013 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 shao et al 2021 xin et al 2019 hence by considering soil water storage changes δ s the atmospheric water supply p can be replaced by the available water supply p e which is expressed as follows 2 p e p δ s correspondingly equation 1 can be redefined as 3 et p δ s 1 e 0 p δ s 1 e 0 p δ s ω 1 ω combined with the water balance equation streamflow q can then be calculated as follows 4 q p δ s 1 e 0 p δ s ω 1 ω e 0 the fitted parameter ω for each catchment was estimated by minimizing the difference between modeled q equation 4 and observed q we extended the method proposed by zhou et al 2016 in order to quantify the driving factors of streamflow changes at different time scales in this method complementary method algebraic identifies ensure that the changes in streamflow can be separated precisely into four components 5 δ q p α q p 1 1 α q p 2 δ p 6 δ q e 0 α q e 0 1 1 α q e 0 2 δ e 0 7 δ

by precipitation potential evapotranspiration soil water storage change and human activities respectively mm subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the different periods defined by the pettitt test parameter α is a weighting factor that has a value between 0 and 1 in this study we used the complementary method with suggested α value of 0 5 zhou et al 2016 therefore the relative contributions to changes in streamflow by each factor δ q x can be calculated as 9 δ q x δ q x δ q p δ q e 0 δ q δ s δ q h 100 when δ s was not considered δ q δ s is equal to zero we also partitioned the contribution of climate and human factors to the changes in streamflow based on the decomposition method wang and hejazi 2011 which allowed cross validation with estimates from the complementary method 10 δ q h p 2 δ s 2 et 2 p 2 δ s 2 et 2 p 2 δ s 2 here et 2 is the mean annual et which can be calculated by equation 3 using the average annual p e 0 and δ s during period 2 and parameter ω during period 1 3 3 direct human water use contributes to changes in streamflow the global monthly gridded sectoral water withdrawal dataset see dataset section was used to quantify the effects of direct human water use on the changes in streamflow given the coarse spatial resolution of this dataset 0 5 and the relatively small area of some catchments less than one million hectares in 67 5 of the catchments this assessment was only conducted along the three above mentioned sections of the mryrb i e tdg lm lm hyk and tdg hyk we estimated seasonal and annual total water use by spatially averaging water use across all grids within the section boundary and then summed monthly values to obtain seasonal and annual values the changes in human water use were typically small such that datasets for the period 2011 2015 were obtained by linear regression the difference in water use value between periods 1 and 2 was regarded as streamflow caused by the direct impacts of human water withdrawals han et al 2019 4 result 4 1 streamflow variation at different timescales the pettitt test showed that there were 36 34 and 32 catchments sections that had years with abrupt change in streamflow at the annual flood season and non flood season scales at the 5 significance level respectively most of them occurred between 1988 and 1999 fig 3 which aligns with the results reported from previous studies in this region liang et al 2015 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2014 due to the majority of annual precipitation occurring between june and september the breakpoints of flood season streamflow were almost identical to those of annual breakpoints suggesting that non flood season streamflow is relatively unimportant at determining annual streamflow in the mryrb furthermore the years of abrupt changes in streamflow at catchments in southern areas e g the wei river yiluo river and fen river generally occurred earlier than those in northern areas e g the kuye river and tuwei river with few exceptions streamflow in all catchments and sections showed a noticeable decrease from period 1 to period 2 over different timescales fig 4 of which the middle parts experienced a relatively more minor reduction however streamflow at the qinduzhen during the flood season increased by 43 between periods and that at the longmenzhen and wuzhi increased by 35 and 75 respectively during the non flood season the annual streamflow reduced by 37 4 with values ranging from 15 7 in zhangcunyi to 74 2 in huangfu meanwhile streamflow during the flood season declined more 42 9 than during the non flood season 31 8 fig 4b and c 4 2 changes in meteorological factors and δ s our calculated streamflow breakpoints were also used to explore the changes in meteorological factors and soil water storage change δ s as shown in fig 5 precipitation generally decreased in the northern and southern areas of the study region i e an average combined reduction of 3 3 and 4 1 in the annual and flood season respectively whereas it increased in the middle areas i e a growth of 2 6 and 4 1 in the annual and flood season respectively by contrast non flood seasonal precipitation in some northern catchments and xinghe increased greatly often by more than 10 precipitation decreased in other regions with an average rate of 4 5 annual and non flood seasonal potential evapotranspiration e 0 increased in most of the catchments but decreased in the yiluo river with rates of change smaller than 5 some catchments of the middle and downstream parts of the wei river showed an additional decrease in e 0 during flood seasons with a mean rate of change of only 2 the three studied sections of the yellow river showed that precipitation declined over all timescales after their breakpoints table 2 with reductions of 0 16 1 43 in the tdg lm 3 29 4 74 in the lm hyk and 4 11 5 26 in the tdg hyk the annual e 0 increased by 1 75 0 76 and 0 77 in the tdg lm lm hyk and tdg hyk sections respectively corresponding values for non flood season e 0 were 3 99 1 86 and 3 71 respectively by contrast the flood season e 0 decreased by 0 36 2 04 and 0 99 respectively figure 6 and figs s1 s3 show mean annual soil water storage changes δ s at annual and seasonal timescales for different soil depths the mean annual values of δ s fluctuated around zero for different soil layers suggesting that δ s has a negligible influence on long term water balance specifically the proportion of annual δ s to mean annual precipitation was less than 0 1 for each section nevertheless the magnitude of annual δ s ranged from 120 to 150 mm for soil layer 3 0 100 cm fig s3 for different seasons figs s1b s1c s2b s2c s3b and s3c the changes in δ s were positive in the flood seasons and negative in the non flood seasons indicating that soil water storage was depleted in the dry season and replenished by precipitation in the wet season the positive value of δ s in flood seasons for different sections accounted for 11 13 of the total water available in soil layer 3 whereas the negative value of δ s in non flood seasons accounted for 27 31 instead fig 6b and c this difference implies that δ s should be considered during water balance analyses that are conducted at short timescales for different periods the annual δ s during period 1 was lower than that during period 2 in most catchments and the degree of reduction between periods increased as the soil layer depth increased interestingly the δ s increased in the first two soil layers 0 7 cm and 0 28 cm soil depth during the flood season in most catchments although an overall decrease occurred when a soil depth of 0 100 cm was considered however in contrast with the pattern documented for flood seasons values for δ s in the first two soil layers in non flood seasons during period 2 were lower than those during period 1 figs s1 and s2 in soil layer 3 this reduction was either smaller or showed an increase in some catchments fig s3 moreover the magnitude of annual and non flood season δ s during period 1 were larger than those during period 2 indicating that soil water instability was enhanced between periods although this pattern was not evident in the flood season in general the mean δ s during period 1 differed from that during period 2 especially at the seasonal scale 4 3 attribution of streamflow changes fig 7 outlines the contributions of individual factors to changes in annual flood season and non flood season streamflow in soil layer 3 0 100 cm at the annual scale fig 7a it can be seen that human activities were the primary cause of decreased streamflow in all catchments with an average rate of 72 7 except for the qin river 26 5 no 40 the contribution rate for human activity was higher in the northern regions than the middle and southern regions by contrast precipitation had a mixed and less effect on streamflow changes with 18 2 average influence in 29 catchments that had declined streamflow while other 11 catchments in the middle areas of the study region partly mitigated this situation i e they showed a 10 3 average influence due to their increased rates fig 5a similarly e 0 reduced streamflow in 27 catchments by an average of 9 8 but increased streamflow in other catchments by an average of 3 8 compared with other factors δ s played a small role it made either a positive or negative contribution to streamflow changes depending on the difference of δ s between period 1 and period 2 this effect is due to the negative coefficient q δ s in equation 7 producing contributions ranging from 12 3 to 9 5 fig 7b and c showed that human activities have an overwhelming influence on streamflow reduction at the seasonal scale specifically they were the primary factor responsible for decreased flood season streamflow at 37 catchments and accounted for an average reduction of 68 4 except for some catchments in the middle parts of the study region fig 5b and 7b precipitation further caused streamflow reduction with a mean contribution rate of 17 5 the mean contribution of e0 had a lower magnitude during flood season than at the annual timescale 13 to 7 8 versus 13 7 to 20 8 respectively with 27 catchments having a value less than 5 the effects of δ s also became more important at shorter timescales for example during the flood season the contribution of δ s was positive in seven catchments with a maximum value of 13 6 but negative in 31 catchments with a maximum value of 30 3 human activities had notably less influence during non flood seasons fig 7c and were the primary factor for decreased streamflow at 25 catchments with an average rate of 63 8 meanwhile human activities induced increased streamflow at four catchments nos 13 14 16 and 25 precipitation decreased the streamflow at 22 catchments and had the opposite effects on streamflow at 16 catchments with mean rates of 23 and 14 respectively in general e 0 had a minor influence on streamflow with mean positive and negative effects of 13 3 and 1 6 respectively nonetheless at some catchments e g ansai and zhangcunyi it made a contribution greater than 30 to streamflow changes highlighting the relative importance of e 0 in these areas finally streamflow reduction was amplified by δ s at half of the studied catchments but it was reduced at the other catchments as shown by mean contribution rates of 24 6 and 10 respectively in addition the impacts of δ s in some rivers e g the huangfu xinshui river and fen river were equivalent to or greater than the impacts of human activities and imparted the dominant control on decreased streamflow human activities dominated streamflow reduction in different sections of the study region and over different timescales fig 7d they had contribution rates of 74 90 56 83 and 51 80 for the tdg lm lm hyk and tdg hyk sections respectively precipitation further amplified this effect in these sections with corresponding contribution rates of 0 7 4 2 7 3 23 3 and 12 25 3 respectively by contrast e 0 had a relatively minor influence reinforcing decreased streamflow during annual 2 2 5 5 and non flood seasons 3 7 7 8 but having negative effects during flood seasons 2 3 7 contributions from δ s ranged from 13 2 to 15 5 in the tdg lm section from 16 6 to 5 8 in the lm hyk section and from 20 5 to 2 in the tdg hyk section moreover we found that the effects of human activities can be overestimated or underestimated unless the effects of δ s are taken into account for example we calculated that human activities have contributed 74 to non flood season streamflow in the tdg lm but this contribution rate would be 90 if the effects of δ s are ignored the discrepancy was even larger in 40 catchments fig s4 if precipitation rate within the mryrb is below a specific threshold it will not generate streamflow jin et al 2020 ran et al 2012 therefore to explore the impacts of precipitation on our attribution analysis of streamflow changes we compared the differences in total precipitation and extreme precipitation that intensity exceeded 12 mm in a day hereafter p12 between the periods 1971 1989 and 2006 2011 over different timescales as shown in fig 8 a values for total precipitation and p12 showed an approximate 1 1 relationship with a linear slope of 0 92 which suggests no apparent difference between changes imparted by either variable over different periods of time although both precipitation products hydrological precipitation and meteorological precipitation see dataset section employ different data sources the negligible changes between total precipitation and extreme precipitation at the same period suggests that they made similar contributions to changes in streamflow in most catchments besides analyzing impacts using a complementary method cm we also used a decomposition method dm to separate the effects of climate change and human activities at different timescales as shown in fig 8b d it can be seen that the impacts of human activities from both methods were generally consistent for most catchments and sections during annual flood season and non flood seasons these results suggest that our contribution analysis for streamflow changes in the mryrb is reliable 4 4 effects of intensive human activities on streamflow to further explore the effects of human activities on streamflow changes we analyzed changes in human water withdrawals from different sectors vegetation coverage and check dam for three sections the latter two factors can indirectly affect streamflow by increasing water consumption for vegetation growth and water storage which will return to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation the results found that human water use increased dramatically due to rapid urbanization and socio economic growth figs s5 and s6 in particular the rate of total water use in the lm hyk increased by 0 65 mm 0 23 mm and 0 42 mm per year during the annual flood and non flood seasons respectively fig s6 and increased by 17 8 mm 7 1 mm and 10 3 mm in these periods before and after the abrupt change in streamflow this rapid rising water use was mainly driven by an increase in domestic electricity and manufacturing water withdrawal on the contrary irrigation water use decreased except for the tdg lm and tdg hyk sections during flood seasons fig s7 increased human water use was the primary factor among all human activities for driving changes in the lm hyk and tdg hyk sections at different timescales with its proportional influence ranging from 60 to 90 fig 9 by contrast the effects of water use and other factors were almost equal in the tdg lm section furthermore other human factors were more important 30 54 during the flood season than that during the non flood season 9 1 49 other human factors that may contribute to decreased streamflow in the study area are the construction of check dams and vegetation restoration liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 however these two factors did not show similar patterns of change in each section fig 10 specifically the number of check dams and their corresponding storage capacity initially increased before the mid 1970s subsequently decreased until 1990 and then rapidly increased again after the abrupt change in annual streamflow fig 10a the mean annual number and total storage of check dams were nearly equal during periods 1 and 2 by contrast vegetation coverage increased by 14 before and after the change in annual and seasonal streamflow therefore we speculated that vegetation restoration played a more important role among other human factors in reducing streamflow in this section by contrast with the tdg lm section the number and storage capacity of check dams in the lm hyk section remained relatively constant before 1990 and then gradually increased fig 10b from 1971 to 2011 the number of check dams increased from fewer than 50 to 850 and their total storage doubled similarly vegetation coverage increased from period 1 to period 2 but at a relatively smaller rate of 3 5 7 7 thus variations in check dams were considered here as the main factor related to other human activities changes in these two factors in the tdg hyk section were similar to those in the tdg lm section but vegetation coverage increasing rate was relatively smaller with a range of 5 4 10 4 for different timescales fig 10c the check dams combined with vegetation restoration and human water withdrawal may together be responsible for streamflow reduction in this section 5 discussion budyko based models have been widely used to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow changes in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin bao et al 2019 liang and liu 2013 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 nevertheless few efforts have been made to examine streamflow changes at shorter timescales for long term hydrological processes that occur in natural and closed catchments the original budyko framework regarded precipitation as the only available source of water for streamflow which fails to consider the effects of changing soil water storage indeed the multi year average change in soil water storage δ s was found to be zero fig 6a and fig s1a s2a and s3a and the average contribution of δ s to streamflow was typically less than 5 at the annual timescale fig 7a and d fig s4a however under non steady state conditions or at finer temporal scales δ s has distinct impacts on the changes in et and streamflow especially in arid and semi arid regions ning et al 2021 shao et al 2021 wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 therefore in this study we extended the traditional budyko framework by considering δ s which allowed us to quantify annual and seasonal changes in streamflow in the mryrb during the period 1971 2015 in agreement with previous studies of this region bao et al 2019 liang and liu 2013 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b we found that streamflow decreased obviously at the annual scale fig 4a and we corroborated former interpretations that rates declined more in the flood season than in the non flood season fig 4b and 4c wu et al 2016 meanwhile our analysis suggests that human activities were commonly the main driving force for streamflow reduction fig 7 but the effects of δ s became progressively more important at increasingly finer scales this effect was significant in the dingjiagou xinshihe and hejin at the seasonal scale where its corresponding relative contribution reached 48 some recent research have considered the water storage change as a part of water supply to extend the budyko framework to an intra annual timescale the new frameworks have been used to investigate the interannual variability of evapotranspiration or runoff in arid regions du et al 2016 mountains regions huang et al 2021 and across large rivers over the globe liu et al 2019 the results of other previous studies and our findings demonstrate the critical role of δ s in the water balance at short timescales to our knowledge few studies have specifically investigated the contribution of δ s to changes in streamflow thus we compared our estimates with recently published reports on the effects of climate change and human activities liang et al 2015 quantified the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow changes during 1961 2009 in the loess plateau i e the center parts of the yellow river basin they concluded that ecological restoration contributed more to streamflow reduction than climate change with this interpretation also supported by similar studies performed for the same period wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 chang et al 2015 reported that human activities were the dominant factors that decreased streamflow during the period 1971 2010 in the jing river these findings generally agreed with our results but the contribution rate of human factors was lower the discrepancy can be explained by the difference in study periods intensive economic development population growth increased water use and vegetation restoration driven by a series of ecological conservation projects all imply that the contribution of human activities should have increased significantly in recent years wu et al 2016 assessed the relative contribution of changes in streamflow during high flow i e flood and low flow i e non flood seasons in 17 catchments over the loess plateau their results were in general agreement with ours but some areas showed inconsistencies such as the fen river and the qingjian river this can be attributed to the sensitivity of streamflow changes to the choice of breakpoints in the time series bao et al 2019 patterson et al 2013 which were assumed to be 1970 for all catchments by wu et al 2016 but were determined by the pettitt test in our study furthermore we found that human activities can alleviate streamflow reduction during non flood seasons as shown in yanchuan ansai and ganguyi fig 7c which has rarely been reported in previous studies in general land cover changes vegetation restoration soil and water conservation measures e g check dams and terraces and human water withdrawal are regarded as the main human activities that affect streamflow regimes destouni et al 2013 ran et al 2020 ukkola et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2014 the conversion of croplands to forests can increase leaf area and rooting depth wang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 and thus affect et and streamflow characteristics however land cover change induced et only accounted for 8 5 of the total regional increases in et liang et al 2020 increases in direct human water use associated with rapid economic growth has caused a dramatic decrease in both surface water and groundwater storage wang et al 2019b yin et al 2017 we found that irrigation which consumes the largest volume of water of all human activities either decreased or slightly increased during flood seasons over the past 45 years fig s7 in contrast other sectoral water withdrawals have accelerated since 1990 especially for domestic electricity and manufacturing which has also been reported on the loess plateau liang et al 2020 and across china zhou et al 2020 this rapid increase in water use was most prominent in the lm hyk section of the yellow river which contains many large and medium sized cities that experienced economic prosperity and associated increases in population density fig 2e and 2f consequently the streamflow breakpoint occurred earlier in this section than the other two studied sections e g lm hyk and tdg hyk fig 3 and water withdrawal was a primary factor among human activities fig 9 previous studies have reported that vegetation restoration has a great impact on streamflow feng et al 2016 liang et al 2015 since the implementation of the grain for green project gfgp in 1999 vegetation coverage in the study region has almost doubled which was mainly conducted in the central and northern regions i e the tdg lm section chen et al 2015 dramatic vegetation restoration would increase evaporative water consumption and thus lower streamflow liang et al 2020 shao et al 2019 compared with the impacts of direct human water withdrawal and check dams the effect of vegetation on streamflow is relatively gradual and has a lag time mainly depending on the vegetation growth between may and october this was further confirmed by the relatively weakened effects of other human factors during the non flood season in the tdg lm section fig 9 considerable studies have shown that human activities are the dominant factors responsible for the significant decrease in the streamflow in the mryrb bao et al 2019 liang et al 2015 wang et al 2019a however the new finding of the current study was to specifically separate the individual effects of human activities and to qualitatively analyze the relative importance of check dams and vegetation restoration in different sections vegetation induced streamflow reduction was interpreted here to be more significant than the influence of check dams in the tdg lm section however even where vegetation coverage before and after the gfgp implementation increased by greater than 20 fig 2d it still did not contribute more than 50 of the total human activities in a region in fact the pettitt test detected that streamflow reduction occurred before large scale vegetation restoration fig 3 reservoirs operations dramatically decreased the seasonal magnitude and variability of streamflow by increasing the number of flows during non flood seasons supplementing water resources for meeting social water demand and reducing the number of flows during flood seasons which reduced flood risks downstream han et al 2019 veldkamp et al 2017 wang et al 2020 it has been reported that there were 148 large or medium sized reservoirs had been constructed in the mryrb by 2020 which had a total storage capacity of 10 billion m3 of water https yrcc gov cn other hhgb cn in addition terrace construction can dramatically reduce streamflow in this region by altering hydrogeological conditions and flow direction ran et al 2020 however due to the lack of detailed information about these factors it was not possible to investigate their individual effects in the current study which will still need to be explored our study contains several sources of uncertainty first the available energy e 0 in the budyko framework was calculated here based on the penman method in this study xin et al 2019 reported that streamflow attribution results from the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 and penman based e 0 estimates had consistent and similar magnitudes suggesting that the uncertainty on e 0 values only has a minor influence on streamflow changes meanwhile estimations of human water withdrawal calculated by global land surface models were another additional source of uncertainty it is noted that the current assessments focused on changes over time instead of absolute volumes of water being extracted additionally although δ s was considered in this study it neglected the changes in groundwater but the groundwater storage anomaly derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite was small in our region because of the thicker soil layer 100 200 m on average feng et al 2016 liang et al 2019 moreover δ s is also affected by human activities e g vegetation restoration for example vegetation restoration increases saturated hydraulic conductivity which increases the surface soil s water content and allows infiltration to deeper layers ran et al 2019 shao et al 2021 concluded that a 44 78 increase in vegetation coverage could lead to a 37 72 decrease in δ s on the loess plateau which we have also confirmed in our study areas further we found negative correlations between δ s p and vegetation coverage changes in catchments with a similar precipitation change 5 and the correlation coefficient increased with increasing soil depth fig s8 a further source of uncertainty is that vegetation climate feedbacks were not considered in our work recent numerical experiments considering vegetation climate feedback have shown that vegetation restoration had caused annual precipitation to increase by 15 on the loess plateau zhang et al 2022 however our attribution analysis was based on the assumption that each factor driving streamflow changes was independent it remains a challenge to understand the interactions between climate soil water storage and human activities at shorter timescales and to completely discriminate the impacts of individual factors which we will systematically explore in future research projects lastly although we considered δ s for the upper 100 cm of soil during streamflow attribution i e 0 100 cm depth water changes that occurred in deeper soil were ignored which may have caused the effects of δ s to be slightly underestimated or overestimated all of the above mentioned factors can lead to uncertainties in determining the individual impacts of factors affecting streamflow 6 conclusion to better understand hydrological processes and manage water resources in the mryrb it is essential to conduct an assessment of the factors that drive streamflow changes over short timescales here we employed the extended budyko based method by considering δ s to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to altering streamflow patterns we applied this method to explore changes in annual and seasonal streamflow at 40 catchments and three sections of the mryrb during the period 1971 2015 meanwhile we further separated the effects of individual human activities and discussed the relative importance of check dams and vegetation restoration in different sections results showed that abrupt changes in streamflow occurred during 1988 1999 in most catchments with years characterized by abrupt changes generally occurring earlier in southern regions than in northern regions streamflow rates clearly decreased over different timescales between period 1 and period 2 except in qinduzhen during the flood season and longmenzhen and wuzhi during the non flood season the average rates of decrease were 37 4 42 9 and 31 8 for annual flood season and non flood seasons respectively human behaviors were the primary factors for streamflow reduction in most cases at the annual average of 72 7 and seasonal scale average of 68 4 for flood season and 63 8 for non flood season however the effects of δ s became more important at increasingly finer scales these contributions by δ s were more influential than human impacts in some cases such as for the xinshui river and fen river in which they made relative contributions up to 48 for the three sections of the mryrb the influence of human activities may have been overestimated or underestimated by 1 16 by not taking into account the effects of δ s our results therefore highlight the critical role of considering δ s in streamflow changes at short timescales further analysis has shown that the rapid increase in human water use for domestic purposes electricity generation and manufacturing was the primary human factor that led to decreased streamflow in the lm hyk and tdg hyk sections over different timescales i e 60 90 of the total influence by comparison the effects of water use and other human factors were almost equal in the tdg lm section with contribution factors of 46 51 and 54 49 respectively among the other human factors that affect streamflow reduction we speculated that the effect of vegetation restoration was greater than check dams in the tdg lm section on the contrary the relative importance factor in the lm hyk section was the construction of the check dams credit authorship contribution statement weibin zhang conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology validation visualization writing

2093,recent climate change and more intensive human activities have induced significant changes in streamflow along the middle reaches of the yellow river basin mryrb which has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community however most previous studies have focused on changes in annual streamflow by examining data from a small number of hydrological stations and the role of the various human activities remains unclear here we used an extended budyko based framework that considered changes in soil water storage δs to determine the contributions of changes in streamflow both at the annual and seasonal scale these analysis were conducted on 40 catchments and three sections toudaoguai longmen tdg lm longmen huayuankou lm hyk and toudaoguai huayuankou tdg hyk in the mryrb from 1971 to 2015 results showed that streamflow at most catchments and sections declined dramatically after years of abrupt change detected by the pettitt test with decreases occurring at a faster rate during flood seasons 42 9 than during non flood seasons 31 8 although human behaviors were often the main cause of streamflow reductions at the annual and seasonal scales the effects of δs became more important at increasingly finer scales indeed they were of equal or greater importance than human impacts in some catchments with corresponding relative contributions up to 48 the effects of human activities may possibly have been overestimated or underestimated by 1 16 in three sections when the impact of δs was not considered further analysis indicated that human water use particularly the rapid increase in water withdrawals for domestic purposes electricity generation and manufacturing was the primary factor among human activities that affected streamflow reduction in the lm hyk and tdg hyk sections at different timescales comprising 60 90 of all impacts by contrast the effects of water use and other human factors were almost equal in the tdg lm section among the other human factors vegetation restoration played a more critical role in the tdg lm section whereas the construction of check dams was more important in the lm hyk section these findings of our study can enhance

yellow river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction much research has shown that streamflow in major rivers around the world has experienced noticeable changes over various time scales being driven by both climate change and human activities haddeland et al 2014 li et al 2020 messager et al 2021 oki and kanae 2006 padrón et al 2020 climate change causes variations in streamflow by altering the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation and evaporation rates in a region donohue et al 2012 kabir et al 2022 kraaijenbrink et al 2021 liang et al 2015 concurrently human activities can either amplify or minimize the effects of climate induced changes in streamflow by forest management evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 singh and basu 2022 dam and reservoir construction patterson et al 2013 veldkamp et al 2017 and extraction of water flörke et al 2018 long et al 2020 therefore identifying the different roles of climate change and human activities in streamflow changes is critical for sustainable management of water resources and understanding of fundamental hydrological processes the yellow river basin is the largest river basin in northern china and plays a vital role in the country s development while the basin sustains a population of 114 million people it only holds 3 of the country s water resources wang et al 2019b however the impacts of climate change and intensifying human influences have led to a significant decline in streamflow in many sub basins within this region over the past 60 years luan et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhan et al 2014 indeed during the 1990s the lower reaches of the mainstream dried up tang et al 2013 which has severe implications for sustainable development of the yellow river basin the water use was close to or even exceeded the amount of water available due to population growth expanding irrigated croplands and economic development cheng et al 2009 qi et al 2022 the disparity between water demand and water supply will likely intensify in the future yin et al 2017 the chinese government recently emphasized the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin thus one of the essential tasks for researchers is to detect streamflow changes and explore their driving mechanisms which is a prerequisite for better managing water resources many workers have studied the relative importance of factors driving streamflow change in the yellow river basin by either performing physical hydrological models or applying statistical methods for example lv et al 2018 estimated the effects of climate and land surface change on natural streamflow with consideration of precipitation intensity wang et al 2020 assessed the impacts of climate change and human activities on various streamflow signatures at four hydrological stations in the yellow river basin these studies mostly used the gauging station along the mainstream with few hydrological stations some other researchers have focused on the typical catchments in this region such as the dali river zhang et al 2021b yan river xu et al 2013 and wei river chang et al 2015 gao et al 2020 despite these efforts the apparent spatial variations in climatic conditions and the intensity of human activity in this area makes it necessary to explore regional differences in the response of hydrological processes due to the poor performance of streamflow simulations for the yellow river basin particularly in the middle catchments and that the time consuming parameters calibration processes in hydrological models wang et al 2020 most previous studies have favored the application of statistical methods by using the outlet hydrological stations of the catchment one such statistical method is the budyko based framework which can avoid the transformation and interaction processes of various elements within the catchment budyko 1974 trancoso et al 2016 wang et al 2015 and so interpret hydrological behaviors from a system focused perspective it thus has been widely applied in areas characterized by intense human activities for example zhao et al 2014 and liang et al 2015 evaluated the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes in the middle parts of the yellow river based on the budyko framework as streamflow changes can be affected by many factors that vary at different spatial scales studies that consider hydrological data from a large number of stations can provide more insightful advances in understanding how streamflow responds to various driving forces bao et al 2019 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 nevertheless while most of these prior studies have focused mainly on changes in annual streamflow rapid development in the yellow river basin infers that it is necessary to assess how these factors influence streamflow at a finer timescale recently wu et al 2016 conducted a contribution analysis of changes in seasonal streamflow yet the soil water storage changes were ignored which maybe underestimated or overestimated the effects of climate change human activities moreover the impacts of different human behaviors in the yellow river basin remain unclear the overall objective of our study was therefore to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to changes in annual and seasonal streamflow over the last 45 years which we achieved by using an extended budyko method that considered changes in soil water storage this assessment was based on streamflow series observed from 40 catchments and three sections in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin mryrb meanwhile we also examined the impacts of direct human water use by using the global water withdrawals dataset and explored the relative importance of check dams and vegetation restoration in different sections of the river 2 materials 2 1 study area this study focused on the mryrb which is located between the toudaoguai and huayuankou hydrological stations fig 1 there are more than 40 tributaries in this section which contribute nearly 44 of the total discharge of the yellow river zhao et al 2014 the area has an apparent semiarid climate and varied seasons the annual average precipitation is 420 mm 1960 2010 with more than 60 of the total precipitation occurring from june to september in the form of high intensity storms zhao et al 2013 rapid development of the region s socio economy profile in recent decades has been supported by annual water withdrawals that increased from 13 7 billion m3 in 1998 to 17 2 billion m3 in 2015 in the mryrb https yrcc gov cn other hhgb which represents a 26 increase in volume in addition vegetation coverage has been dramatically improved following the implementation of a series of ecological conservation projects bryan et al 2018 fu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a which altered local hydrological processes the combined effects of climate change and human disturbances have caused streamflow in the region to significantly decrease during the past few decades which has hindered high quality development of the yellow river basin therefore it is necessary to quantify the individual impacts that climate change and various human factors have had on the changes in streamflow at different timescales in this region based on available streamflow datasets from 1971 to 2015 we selected 40 catchments which encompass a variety of hydro meteorological conditions land surface types and physical characteristics see table 1 and fig 2 we also divided the mryrb into three sections delimited by the toudaoguai longmen and huayuankou hydrological stations i e toudaoguai longmen tdg lm longmen huayuankou lm hyk and toudaoguai huayuankou tdg hyk in order to further examine the impacts of different human behavior on streamflow changes in spatial the tdg lm section consists of catchments nos 1 20 and the lm hyk covers the remaining catchments nos

vegetation index ndvi dataset which has a spatial resolution of 8 km covering the period 1982 2015 and was derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor tucker et al 2005 then vegetation coverage was obtained following the method presented by yang et al 2009 which is based on maximum ndvi minimum ndvi and ndvi value all of these variables were processed into region averaged values with the catchments discussed in our study being the regions above each hydrological station information concerning the location date of construction and storage capacity of check dam was provided by the shaanxi province soil and water conservation environment monitoring center with the increase of the sediment deposition check dam would be fully deposited or even destroyed by the frequently occurring floods thereby having relatively less impact on streamflow reduction liang et al 2015 here the lifetime of the check dam was assumed to be 15 years and its storage was assumed to decrease linearly over time since it began to operate which allowed us to calculate its total capacity and storage each year 3 method 3 1 detection of streamflow breakpoints the pettitt breakpoint test pettitt 1979 has been widely used to identify the breakpoint of meteorological and hydrological variables in this work we applied this method to detect the abrupt changes in a time series of observed streamflow 40 catchments and three sections at annual and seasonal timescales during the study period table 1 based on the pettitt test we divided the study period into two periods period 1 prior to and including breakpoint year and period 2 after breakpoint year 3 2 attribution method based on the extended budyko model the budyko type method can express the nonlinear relationships between streamflow and its influencing factors and is usually applied to examine the separate impacts of climate change and human activities on the annual streamflow changes in the study we adopted fu s equation fu 1981 which introduced a dimensionless parameter ω to represent the comprehensive effects of catchment characteristics such as vegetation land use climate seasonality and human water withdrawal donohue et al 2007 liu et al 2022 vora and singh 2021 1 et p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p ω 1 ω where p is precipitation mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm and e 0 is the potential evaporation mm many previous studies of annual streamflow attribution assumed that water storage does not change liang et al 2015 tang and wang 2021 wang et al 2019a however at shorter timescales e g at the seasonal scale water storage dynamics are not negligible chen et al 2013 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 shao et al 2021 xin et al 2019 hence by considering soil water storage changes δ s the atmospheric water supply p can be replaced by the available water supply p e which is expressed as follows 2 p e p δ s correspondingly equation 1 can be redefined as 3 et p δ s 1 e 0 p δ s 1 e 0 p δ s ω 1 ω combined with the water balance equation streamflow q can then be calculated as follows 4 q p δ s 1 e 0 p δ s ω 1 ω e 0 the fitted parameter ω for each catchment was estimated by minimizing the difference between modeled q equation 4 and observed q we extended the method proposed by zhou et al 2016 in order to quantify the driving factors of streamflow changes at different time scales in this method complementary method algebraic identifies ensure that the changes in streamflow can be separated precisely into four components 5 δ q p α q p 1 1 α q p 2 δ p 6 δ q e 0 α q e 0 1 1 α q e 0 2 δ e 0 7 δ

is a weighting factor that has a value between 0 and 1 in this study we used the complementary method with suggested α value of 0 5 zhou et al 2016 therefore the relative contributions to changes in streamflow by each factor δ q x can be calculated as 9 δ q x δ q x δ q p δ q e 0 δ q δ s δ q h 100 when δ s was not considered δ q δ s is equal to zero we also partitioned the contribution of climate

2 p 2 δ s 2 et 2 p 2 δ s 2 here et 2 is the mean annual et which can be calculated by equation 3 using the average annual p e 0 and δ s during period 2 and parameter ω during period 1 3 3 direct human water use contributes to changes in streamflow the global monthly gridded sectoral water withdrawal dataset see dataset section was used to quantify the effects of direct human water use on the changes in streamflow given the coarse spatial resolution of this dataset 0 5 and the relatively small area of some catchments less than one million hectares in 67 5 of the catchments this assessment was only conducted along the three above mentioned sections of the mryrb i e tdg lm lm hyk and tdg hyk we estimated seasonal and annual total water use by spatially averaging water use across all grids within the section boundary and then summed monthly values to obtain seasonal and annual values the changes in human water use were typically small such that datasets for the period 2011 2015 were obtained by linear regression the difference in water use value between periods 1 and 2 was regarded as streamflow caused by the direct impacts of human water withdrawals han et al 2019 4 result 4 1 streamflow variation at different timescales the pettitt test showed that there were 36 34 and 32 catchments sections that had years with abrupt change in streamflow at the annual flood season and non flood season scales at the 5 significance level respectively most of them occurred between 1988 and 1999 fig 3 which aligns with the results reported from previous studies in this region liang et al 2015 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2014 due to the majority of annual precipitation occurring between june and september the breakpoints of flood season streamflow were almost identical to those of annual breakpoints suggesting that non flood season streamflow is relatively unimportant at determining annual streamflow in the mryrb furthermore the years of abrupt changes in streamflow at catchments in southern areas e g the wei river yiluo river and fen river generally occurred earlier than those in northern areas e g the kuye river and tuwei river with few exceptions streamflow in all catchments and sections showed a noticeable decrease from period 1 to period 2 over different timescales fig 4 of which the middle parts experienced a relatively more minor reduction however streamflow at the qinduzhen during the flood season increased by 43 between periods and that at the longmenzhen and wuzhi increased by 35 and 75 respectively during the non flood season the annual streamflow reduced by 37 4 with values ranging from 15 7 in zhangcunyi to 74 2 in huangfu meanwhile streamflow during the flood season declined more 42 9 than during the non flood season 31 8 fig 4b and c 4 2 changes in meteorological factors and δ s our calculated streamflow breakpoints were also used to explore the changes in meteorological factors and soil water storage change δ s as shown in fig 5 precipitation generally decreased in the northern and southern areas of the study region i e an average combined reduction of 3 3 and 4 1 in the annual and flood season respectively whereas it increased in the middle areas i e a growth of 2 6 and 4 1 in the annual and flood season respectively by contrast non flood seasonal precipitation in some northern catchments and xinghe increased greatly often by more than 10 precipitation decreased in other regions with an average rate of 4 5 annual and non flood seasonal potential evapotranspiration e 0 increased in most of the catchments but decreased in the yiluo river with rates of change smaller than 5 some catchments of the middle and downstream parts of the wei river showed an additional decrease in e 0 during flood seasons with a mean rate of change of only 2 the three studied sections of the yellow river showed that precipitation declined over all timescales after their breakpoints table 2 with reductions of 0 16 1 43 in the tdg lm 3 29 4 74 in the lm hyk and 4 11 5 26 in the tdg hyk the annual e 0 increased by 1 75 0 76 and 0 77 in the tdg lm lm hyk and tdg hyk sections respectively corresponding values for non flood season e 0 were 3 99 1 86 and 3 71 respectively by contrast the flood season e 0 decreased by 0 36 2 04 and 0 99 respectively figure 6 and figs s1 s3 show mean annual soil water storage changes δ s at annual and seasonal timescales for different soil depths the mean annual values of δ s fluctuated around zero for different soil layers suggesting that δ s has a negligible influence on long term water balance specifically the proportion of annual δ s to mean annual precipitation was less than 0 1 for each section nevertheless the magnitude of annual δ s ranged from 120 to 150 mm for soil layer 3 0 100 cm fig s3 for different seasons figs s1b s1c s2b s2c s3b and s3c the changes in δ s were positive in the flood seasons and negative in the non flood seasons indicating that soil water storage was depleted in the dry season and replenished by precipitation in the wet season the positive value of δ s in flood seasons for different sections accounted for 11 13 of the total water available in soil layer 3 whereas the negative value of δ s in non flood seasons accounted for 27 31 instead fig 6b and c this difference implies that δ s should be considered during water balance analyses that are conducted at short timescales for different periods the annual δ s during period 1 was lower than that during period 2 in most catchments and the degree of reduction between periods increased as the soil layer depth increased interestingly the δ s increased in the first two soil layers 0 7 cm and 0 28 cm soil depth during the flood season in most catchments although an overall decrease occurred when a soil depth of 0 100 cm was considered however in contrast with the pattern documented for flood seasons values for δ s in the first two soil layers in non flood seasons during period 2 were lower than those during period 1 figs s1 and s2 in soil layer 3 this reduction was either smaller or showed an increase in some catchments fig s3 moreover the magnitude of annual and non flood season δ s during period 1 were larger than those during period 2 indicating that soil water instability was enhanced between periods although this pattern was not evident in the flood season in general the mean δ s during period 1 differed from that during period 2 especially at the seasonal scale 4 3 attribution of streamflow changes fig 7 outlines the contributions of individual factors to changes in annual flood season and non flood season streamflow in soil layer 3 0 100 cm at the annual scale fig 7a it can be seen that human activities were the primary cause of decreased streamflow in all catchments with an average rate of 72 7 except for the qin river 26 5 no 40 the contribution rate for human activity was higher in the northern regions than the middle and southern regions by contrast precipitation had a mixed and less effect on streamflow changes with 18 2 average influence in 29 catchments that had declined streamflow while other 11 catchments in the middle areas of the study region partly mitigated this situation i e they showed a 10 3 average influence due to their increased rates fig 5a similarly e 0 reduced streamflow in 27 catchments by an average of 9 8 but increased streamflow in other catchments by an average of 3 8 compared with other factors δ s played a small role it made either a positive or negative contribution to streamflow changes depending on the difference of δ s between period 1 and period 2 this effect is due to the negative coefficient q δ s in equation 7 producing contributions ranging from 12 3 to 9 5 fig 7b and c showed that human activities have an overwhelming influence on streamflow reduction at the seasonal scale specifically they were the primary factor responsible for decreased flood season streamflow at 37 catchments and accounted for an average reduction of 68 4 except for some catchments in the middle parts of the study region fig 5b and 7b precipitation further caused streamflow reduction with a mean contribution rate of 17 5 the mean contribution of e0 had a lower magnitude during flood season than at the annual timescale 13 to 7 8 versus 13 7 to 20 8 respectively with 27 catchments having a value less than 5 the effects of δ s also became more important at shorter timescales for example during the flood season the contribution of δ s was positive in seven catchments with a maximum value of 13 6 but negative in 31 catchments with a maximum value of 30 3 human activities had notably less influence during non flood seasons fig 7c and were the primary factor for decreased streamflow at 25 catchments with an average rate of 63 8 meanwhile human activities induced increased streamflow at four catchments nos 13 14 16 and 25 precipitation decreased the streamflow at 22 catchments and had the opposite effects on streamflow at 16 catchments with mean rates of 23 and 14 respectively in general e 0 had a minor influence on streamflow with mean positive and negative effects of 13 3 and 1 6 respectively nonetheless at some catchments e g ansai and zhangcunyi it made a contribution greater than 30 to streamflow changes highlighting the relative importance of e 0 in these areas finally streamflow reduction was amplified by δ s at half of the studied catchments but it was reduced at the other catchments as shown by mean contribution rates of 24 6 and 10 respectively in addition the impacts of δ s in some rivers e g the huangfu xinshui river and fen river were equivalent to or greater than the impacts of human activities and imparted the dominant control on decreased streamflow human activities dominated streamflow reduction in different sections of the study region and over different timescales fig 7d they had contribution rates of 74 90 56 83 and 51 80 for the tdg lm lm hyk and tdg hyk sections respectively precipitation further amplified this effect in these sections with corresponding contribution rates of 0 7 4 2 7 3 23 3 and 12 25 3 respectively by contrast e 0 had a relatively minor influence reinforcing decreased streamflow during annual 2 2 5 5 and non flood seasons 3 7 7 8 but having negative effects during flood seasons 2 3 7 contributions from δ s ranged from 13 2 to 15 5 in the tdg lm section from 16 6 to 5 8 in the lm hyk section and from 20 5 to 2 in the tdg hyk section moreover we found that the effects of human activities can be overestimated or underestimated unless the effects of δ s are taken into account for example we calculated that human activities have contributed 74 to non flood season streamflow in the tdg lm but this contribution rate would be 90 if the effects of δ s are ignored the discrepancy was even larger in 40 catchments fig s4 if precipitation rate within the mryrb is below a specific threshold it will not generate streamflow jin et al 2020 ran et al 2012 therefore to explore the impacts of precipitation on our attribution analysis of streamflow changes we compared the differences in total precipitation and extreme precipitation that intensity exceeded 12 mm in a day hereafter p12 between the periods 1971 1989 and 2006 2011 over different timescales as shown in fig 8 a values for total precipitation and p12 showed an approximate 1 1 relationship with a linear slope of 0 92 which suggests no apparent difference between changes imparted by either variable over different periods of time although both precipitation products hydrological precipitation and meteorological precipitation see dataset section employ different data sources the negligible changes between total precipitation and extreme precipitation at the same period suggests that they made similar contributions to changes in streamflow in most catchments besides analyzing impacts using a complementary method cm we also used a decomposition method dm to separate the effects of climate change and human activities at different timescales as shown in fig 8b d it can be seen that the impacts of human activities from both methods were generally consistent for most catchments and sections during annual flood season and non flood seasons these results suggest that our contribution analysis for streamflow changes in the mryrb is reliable 4 4 effects of intensive human activities on streamflow to further explore the effects of human activities on streamflow changes we analyzed changes in human water withdrawals from different sectors vegetation coverage and check dam for three sections the latter two factors can indirectly affect streamflow by increasing water consumption for vegetation growth and water storage which will return to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation the results found that human water use increased dramatically due to rapid urbanization and socio economic growth figs s5 and s6 in particular the rate of total water use in the lm hyk increased by 0 65 mm 0 23 mm and 0 42 mm per year during the annual flood and non flood seasons respectively fig s6 and increased by 17 8 mm 7 1 mm and 10 3 mm in these periods before and after the abrupt change in streamflow this rapid rising water use was mainly driven by an increase in domestic electricity and manufacturing water withdrawal on the contrary irrigation water use decreased except for the tdg lm and tdg hyk sections during flood seasons fig s7 increased human water use was the primary factor among all human activities for driving changes in the lm hyk and tdg hyk sections at different timescales with its proportional influence ranging from 60 to 90 fig 9 by contrast the effects of water use and other factors were almost equal in the tdg lm section furthermore other human factors were more important 30 54 during the flood season than that during the non flood season 9 1 49 other human factors that may contribute to decreased streamflow in the study area are the construction of check dams and vegetation restoration liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 however these two factors did not show similar patterns of change in each section fig 10 specifically the number of check dams and their corresponding storage capacity initially increased before the mid 1970s subsequently decreased until 1990 and then rapidly increased again after the abrupt change in annual streamflow fig 10a the mean annual number and total storage of check dams were nearly equal during periods 1 and 2 by contrast vegetation coverage increased by 14 before and after the change in annual and seasonal streamflow therefore we speculated that vegetation restoration played a more important role among other human factors in reducing streamflow in this section by contrast with the tdg lm section the number and storage capacity of check dams in the lm hyk section remained relatively constant before 1990 and then gradually increased fig 10b from 1971 to 2011 the number of check dams increased from fewer than 50 to 850 and their total storage doubled similarly vegetation coverage increased from period 1 to period 2 but at a relatively smaller rate of 3 5 7 7 thus variations in check dams were considered here as the main factor related to other human activities changes in these two factors in the tdg hyk section were similar to those in the tdg lm section but vegetation coverage increasing rate was relatively smaller with a range of 5 4 10 4 for different timescales fig 10c the check dams combined with vegetation restoration and human water withdrawal may together be responsible for streamflow reduction in this section 5 discussion budyko based models have been widely used to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow changes in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin bao et al 2019 liang and liu 2013 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 nevertheless few efforts have been made to examine streamflow changes at shorter timescales for long term hydrological processes that occur in natural and closed catchments the original budyko framework regarded precipitation as the only available source of water for streamflow which fails to consider the effects of changing soil water storage indeed the multi year average change in soil water storage δ s was found to be zero fig 6a and fig s1a s2a and s3a and the average contribution of δ s to streamflow was typically less than 5 at the annual timescale fig 7a and d fig s4a however under non steady state conditions or at finer temporal scales δ s has distinct impacts on the changes in et and streamflow especially in arid and semi arid regions ning et al 2021 shao et al 2021 wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 therefore in this study we extended the traditional budyko framework by considering δ s which allowed us to quantify annual and seasonal changes in streamflow in the mryrb during the period 1971 2015 in agreement with previous studies of this region bao et al 2019 liang and liu 2013 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2019b we found that streamflow decreased obviously at the annual scale fig 4a and we corroborated former interpretations that rates declined more in the flood season than in the non flood season fig 4b and 4c wu et al 2016 meanwhile our analysis suggests that human activities were commonly the main driving force for streamflow reduction fig 7 but the effects of δ s became progressively more important at increasingly finer scales this effect was significant in the dingjiagou xinshihe and hejin at the seasonal scale where its corresponding relative contribution reached 48 some recent research have considered the water storage change as a part of water supply to extend the budyko framework to an intra annual timescale the new frameworks have been used to investigate the interannual variability of evapotranspiration or runoff in arid regions du et al 2016 mountains regions huang et al 2021 and across large rivers over the globe liu et al 2019 the results of other previous studies and our findings demonstrate the critical role of δ s in the water balance at short timescales to our knowledge few studies have specifically investigated the contribution of δ s to changes in streamflow thus we compared our estimates with recently published reports on the effects of climate change and human activities liang et al 2015 quantified the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow changes during 1961 2009 in the loess plateau i e the center parts of the yellow river basin they concluded that ecological restoration contributed more to streamflow reduction than climate change with this interpretation also supported by similar studies performed for the same period wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 chang et al 2015 reported that human activities were the dominant factors that decreased streamflow during the period 1971 2010 in the jing river these findings generally agreed with our results but the contribution rate of human factors was lower the discrepancy can be explained by the difference in study periods intensive economic development population growth increased water use and vegetation restoration driven by a series of ecological conservation projects all imply that the contribution of human activities should have increased significantly in recent years wu et al 2016 assessed the relative contribution of changes in streamflow during high flow i e flood and low flow i e non flood seasons in 17 catchments over the loess plateau their results were in general agreement with ours but some areas showed inconsistencies such as the fen river and the qingjian river this can be attributed to the sensitivity of streamflow changes to the choice of breakpoints in the time series bao et al 2019 patterson et al 2013 which were assumed to be 1970 for all catchments by wu et al 2016 but were determined by the pettitt test in our study furthermore we found that human activities can alleviate streamflow reduction during non flood seasons as shown in yanchuan ansai and ganguyi fig 7c which has rarely been reported in previous studies in general land cover changes vegetation restoration soil and water conservation measures e g check dams and terraces and human water withdrawal are regarded as the main human activities that affect streamflow regimes destouni et al 2013 ran et al 2020 ukkola et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2014 the conversion of croplands to forests can increase leaf area and rooting depth wang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 and thus affect et and streamflow characteristics however land cover change induced et only accounted for 8 5 of the total regional increases in et liang et al 2020 increases in direct human water use associated with rapid economic growth has caused a dramatic decrease in both surface water and groundwater storage wang et al 2019b yin et al 2017 we found that irrigation which consumes the largest volume of water of all human activities either decreased or slightly increased during flood seasons over the past 45 years fig s7 in contrast other sectoral water withdrawals have accelerated since 1990 especially for domestic electricity and manufacturing which has also been reported on the loess plateau liang et al 2020 and across china zhou et al 2020 this rapid increase in water use was most prominent in the lm hyk section of the yellow river which contains many large and medium sized cities that experienced economic prosperity and associated increases in population density fig 2e and 2f consequently the streamflow breakpoint occurred earlier in this section than the other two studied sections e g lm hyk and tdg hyk fig 3 and water withdrawal was a primary factor among human activities fig 9 previous studies have reported that vegetation restoration has a great impact on streamflow feng et al 2016 liang et al 2015 since the implementation of the grain for green project gfgp in 1999 vegetation coverage in the study region has almost doubled which was mainly conducted in the central and northern regions i e the tdg lm section chen et al 2015 dramatic vegetation restoration would increase evaporative water consumption and thus lower streamflow liang et al 2020 shao et al 2019 compared with the impacts of direct human water withdrawal and check dams the effect of vegetation on streamflow is relatively gradual and has a lag time mainly depending on the vegetation growth between may and october this was further confirmed by the relatively weakened effects of other human factors during the non flood season in the tdg lm section fig 9 considerable studies have shown that human activities are the dominant factors responsible for the significant decrease in the streamflow in the mryrb bao et al 2019 liang et al 2015 wang et al 2019a however the new finding of the current study was to specifically separate the individual effects of human activities and to qualitatively analyze the relative importance of check dams and vegetation restoration in different sections vegetation induced streamflow reduction was interpreted here to be more significant than the influence of check dams in the tdg lm section however even where vegetation coverage before and after the gfgp implementation increased by greater than 20 fig 2d it still did not contribute more than 50 of the total human activities in a region in fact the pettitt test detected that streamflow reduction occurred before large scale vegetation restoration fig 3 reservoirs operations dramatically decreased the seasonal magnitude and variability of streamflow by increasing the number of flows during non flood seasons supplementing water resources for meeting social water demand and reducing the number of flows during flood seasons which reduced flood risks downstream han et al 2019 veldkamp et al 2017 wang et al 2020 it has been reported that there were 148 large or medium sized reservoirs had been constructed in the mryrb by 2020 which had a total storage capacity of 10 billion m3 of water https yrcc gov cn other hhgb cn in addition terrace construction can dramatically reduce streamflow in this region by altering hydrogeological conditions and flow direction ran et al 2020 however due to the lack of detailed information about these factors it was not possible to investigate their individual effects in the current study which will still need to be explored our study contains several sources of uncertainty first the available energy e 0 in the budyko framework was calculated here based on the penman method in this study xin et al 2019 reported that streamflow attribution results from the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 and penman based e 0 estimates had consistent and similar magnitudes suggesting that the uncertainty on e 0 values only has a minor influence on streamflow changes meanwhile estimations of human water withdrawal calculated by global land surface models were another additional source of uncertainty it is noted that the current assessments focused on changes over time instead of absolute volumes of water being extracted additionally although δ s was considered in this study it neglected the changes in groundwater but the groundwater storage anomaly derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite was small in our region because of the thicker soil layer 100 200 m on average feng et al 2016 liang et al 2019 moreover δ s is also affected by human activities e g vegetation restoration for example vegetation restoration increases saturated hydraulic conductivity which increases the surface soil s water content and allows infiltration to deeper layers ran et al 2019 shao et al 2021 concluded that a 44 78 increase in vegetation coverage could lead to a 37 72 decrease in δ s on the loess plateau which we have also confirmed in our study areas further we found negative correlations between δ s p and vegetation coverage changes in catchments with a similar precipitation change 5 and the correlation coefficient increased with increasing soil depth fig s8 a further source of uncertainty is that vegetation climate feedbacks were not considered in our work recent numerical experiments considering vegetation climate feedback have shown that vegetation restoration had caused annual precipitation to increase by 15 on the loess plateau zhang et al 2022 however our attribution analysis was based on the assumption that each factor driving streamflow changes was independent it remains a challenge to understand the interactions between climate soil water storage and human activities at shorter timescales and to completely discriminate the impacts of individual factors which we will systematically explore in future research projects lastly although we considered δ s for the upper 100 cm of soil during streamflow attribution i e 0 100 cm depth water changes that occurred in deeper soil were ignored which may have caused the effects of δ s to be slightly underestimated or overestimated all of the above mentioned factors can lead to uncertainties in determining the individual impacts of factors affecting streamflow 6 conclusion to better understand hydrological processes and manage water resources in the mryrb it is essential to conduct an assessment of the factors that drive streamflow changes over short timescales here we employed the extended budyko based method by considering δ s to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to altering streamflow patterns we applied this method to explore changes in annual and seasonal streamflow at 40 catchments and three sections of the mryrb during the period 1971 2015 meanwhile we further separated the effects of individual human activities and discussed the relative importance of check dams and vegetation restoration in different sections results showed that abrupt changes in streamflow occurred during 1988 1999 in most catchments with years characterized by abrupt changes generally occurring earlier in southern regions than in northern regions streamflow rates clearly decreased over different timescales between period 1 and period 2 except in qinduzhen during the flood season and longmenzhen and wuzhi during the non flood season the average rates of decrease were 37 4 42 9 and 31 8 for annual flood season and non flood seasons respectively human behaviors were the primary factors for streamflow reduction in most cases at the annual average of 72 7 and seasonal scale average of 68 4 for flood season and 63 8 for non flood season however the effects of δ s became more important at increasingly finer scales these contributions by δ s were more influential than human impacts in some cases such as for the xinshui river and fen river in which they made relative contributions up to 48 for the three sections of the mryrb the influence of human activities may have been overestimated or underestimated by 1 16 by not taking into account the effects of δ s our results therefore highlight the critical role of considering δ s in streamflow changes at short timescales further analysis has shown that the rapid increase in human water use for domestic purposes electricity generation and manufacturing was the primary human factor that led to decreased streamflow in the lm hyk and tdg hyk sections over different timescales i e 60 90 of the total influence by comparison the effects of water use and other human factors were almost equal in the tdg lm section with contribution factors of 46 51 and 54 49 respectively among the other human factors that affect streamflow reduction we speculated that the effect of vegetation restoration was greater than check dams in the tdg lm section on the contrary the relative importance factor in the lm hyk section was

2094,blowing snow has a major impact on the spatial temporal evolution of snow cover an accurate prediction of the initiation of snow particle movement is one of the prerequisites for blowing snow modeling previous studies have proposed varied complexity parameterizations to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow however a quantitative evaluation of the performance of different schemes in blowing snow identification remains lacking particularly outside the regions where empirical schemes were proposed this study details a comparative study of the performance of five distinct parameterizations with varying degrees of complexity in estimating the occurrence of blowing snow over the central french alps our results show that less than half of blowing snow events can be accurately detected at most stations by traditional schemes for example the constant and temperature based empirical threshold wind speed schemes probability estimation and physically based methods in addition the spatial variability of wind speed can result in considerable spatial variability in the occurrence of blowing snow which cannot be captured by traditional methods decision tree based models can detect blowing snow occurrences with higher accuracy and the spatial variation in snow transport can be captured by including information on blowing snow occurrences at low wind speed stations however regardless of the training strategies employed the decision tree based model employed here estimated far too many false alarms this study contributes to blowing snow modeling by presenting the current state of the art and limitations of various schemes for detecting blowing snow occurrences and highlights the importance of parameterization modification key parameter calibration and optimization keywords blowing snow occurrences threshold wind speed quantitative evaluation parameterizations data availability i have shared the link to my data 1 introduction mountain snowpacks have important influences on the hydrological cycle ecosystems and climate variability as shown both by observational and by modeling studies mankin et al 2015 musselman et al 2017 phoenix 2018 wind transported snow affects hydrological processes by redistributing snow mass driving heterogeneous snow accumulation and altering snowmelt runoff patterns in cold and windy open areas li and pomeroy 1997b palm et al 2011 zhou et al 2021 blowing snow is a major factor in snowpack evolution pomeroy and male 1992 liston et al 2020 with significant implications for the earth s climate

resistance li and pomeroy 1997a the occurrence of blowing snow depends largely on a combination of ambient meteorological conditions e g wind speed and air temperature snowpack properties e g hardness density and particle size and vegetation properties gacitúa et al 2013 all these factors make the blowing snow process complex and the initiation of snow particle movement is therefore challenging to estimate on a deterministic and physical basis li and pomeroy 1997b most current physically realistic models neglect or oversimplify the effects of wind redistribution of snow liston 2004 the lack of snow redistribution representation has been identified as a major source of uncertainty in simulations of snow cover evolution mott et al 2018 xie et al 2018 and energy and moisture budgets barral et al 2014 the wind speed at which blowing snow initiates is referred to as the threshold wind speed schmidt 1986 pomeroy and gray 1990 li and pomeroy 1997a this parameter is important in terms of predicting the initiation of snow particle movement because the module for calculating snow transport and sublimation activates only when the wind speed exceeds the threshold wind speed in most current models accurately estimating the threshold wind speed for an initial motion of snow transport is one of the key challenges facing in prediction of the occurrence of blowing snow and quantifying subsequent impacts therefore one of the prerequisites of snow transport modeling is parameterizing the initiation of snow particle movement which has a profound implications for the thermodynamic structure of the planetary boundary layer bintanja 2001 yang and yau 2011 palm et al 2017 surface water budget bintanja and reijmer 2001 zhou et al 2014 surface radiation budget yamanouchi and kawaguchi 1985 yang et al 2014 and the prevention and control of snow damage baggaley and hanesiak 2005 estimates of the threshold wind speed for blowing snow vary widely between different studies mellor 1965 reported that the threshold wind speed for loose and unbounded snow was typically 3 to 8 m s 1 recorded at 10 m height and wind speeds of 30 m s 1 are required to overcome the freeze thaw process bounded snowpack resistance berg 1986 and schmidt 1982 found that a 1 m height wind speed of 4 to 6 m s 1 about 5 7 to 8 6 m s 1 for 10 m height with roughness length equals to 0 005 m was necessary to initiate snow transport at niwot ridge colorado according to a study of hourly average threshold wind speeds in the canadian prairies li and pomeroy 1997a the majority of recorded speeds range from 7 to 14 m s 1 average of 9 9 m s 1 for wet transport and from 4 to 11 m s 1 average of 7 7 m s 1 for dry snow transport liston et al 2007 identified typical values for the threshold wind speed ranging from 4 to 5 m s 1 at 10 m height for new or slightly aged cold dry snow most earlier studies assumed a constant threshold wind speed despite the acknowledgement of the differences between various snow types which depend on moisture content or deposition time field measurements provide practical information for understanding the physical properties of blowing snow occurrence however because of the contrasting measurement conditions the observed occurrence of blowing snow varies spatially and temporally leading to notable variability in threshold wind speed in different studies most variation is attributable to the differences in wind speed air temperature and characteristics of snow baggaley and hanesiak 2005 therefore the applicability of a constant threshold wind speed in detecting the initiation of snow particle movement outside the observation region may be greatly influenced by these factors xie et al 2021 many empirical formulas have been proposed to describe the relationships between threshold wind speed and snowpack conditions schmidt 1980 identified the influences of ambient air temperature humidity particle size impact force and deposition time on the threshold wind speed and derived a formula that explicitly depicts the snow particle bonding resistance several attempts have been made to link the threshold wind speed with snow metamorphism e g lehning et al 2000 snowpack properties such as snow density e g guyomarc h and mérindol 1998 gallée et al 2001 and bond diameter between snow particles clifton et al 2006 li and pomeroy 1997b concluded that the decisive factors underlying the snow bonding cohesion and frictional properties are related to air temperature and then proposed an empirical solution of the threshold wind speed for the initiation of snow transport using standard surface meteorological observations from 16 meteorological stations in the canadian prairies on the basis that the probability distribution for snow particle movement with regard to wind speed approximates a cumulative normal distribution li and pomeroy 1997b proposed a statistical method to investigate the occurrence of blowing snow these practical empirical solutions together with wind tunnel experiments and field experiment results provided the basis for the development of blowing snow models déry and yau 1999 pomeroy and li 2000 déry and yau 2001 bowling et al 2004 new solutions for the threshold condition of snow movement have been constantly emerging in recent years for example he and ohara 2017 derived a new physically based formula that expresses the threshold wind speed as a function of temperature snow particle radius and snow deposition time with snow sintering taken into account however two empirical parameters in the sintering process were determined through model calibration using field observations of snow flux from the isaw stations detailes in section 3 1 machine learning provides another potential tool to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow an example of this is the application of decision tree based models by xie et al 2021 which were constructed based on routine meteorological observations and applied to detect blowing snow occurrence in the european alps for an realistic estimate of the blowing snow mass flux and its associated impacts precise prediction of blowing snow occurrence is the essential prerequisite a variety of parameterization schemes have been proposed i e constant threshold wind speed temperature based threshold wind speed probability based estimation and physically based threshold wind speed these schemes have been widely applied in visibility estimation baggaley and hanesiak 2005 avalanche forecasting vionnet et al 2018 etc however uncertainties arising from variances in climatic and environmental conditions as well as the spatial variability of snow properties field validation of parameterizations is necessary to our knowledge although preliminary assessments have evaluated the ability of different blowing snow models in simulating snow redistribution gauer 1998 xiao et al 2000 few relevant comparative analysis of model performance in estimating blowing snow occurrence have been carried out therefore limited perspectives are aviliable to guide the improvement in the blowing snow occurrence detection faced with a diversity of approaches and applications an intercomparison and comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty of different threshold wind speed methods with varying complexity in blowing snow occurrence prediction is undoubtedly of great importance for improving algorithms and thus increasing the reliability of corresponding estimations such a comparison will also provide a valuable scientific reference for model developers decision makers and users e g avalanche forecasters snow safety services etc to our knowledge several issues have yet to be addressed as follows to what extent do current forecast techniques capture the pattern of blowing snow occurrences which factors contribute to the uncertainty in detecting blowing snow occurrence which scheme holds the most promising potential for blowing snow occurrence prediction what special efforts should be made to reduce uncertainties in the prediction of blowing snow for various types of schemes of varying complexity this study aims to answer these questions by assessing and analyzing the ability of different parameterizations in detecting blowing snow occurrences the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces five kinds of blowing snow occurrence estimation techniques with varying complexity section 3 covers the observations and methodology employed in this study which includes the field observations data pre processing data classification and evaluation metrics section 4 focuses on the metrics based analysis of uncertainties section 5 discusses the potential factors attributed to the uncertainty of each scheme and section 6 concludes with a summary and conclusions 2 parameterization description five different methods for detecting snow transport were evaluated against field observations from nine isaw stations three of the five are based on the predicted threshold wind speed one on the estimated occurrence probability and one is data driven although field observations from the isaw network were used in the construction of the physically based threshold formula and the decision tree based method their ability were comprehensively evaluated and compared with other algorithms proposed outside the european alps in an attempt to understand the current state of the art and limitations of these parameterizations 2 1 constant threshold scheme the majority of recorded threshold wind speeds at the height of 10 m range from 7 to 14 m s 1 for wet snow transport and from 4 to 11 m s 1 for dry snow transport according to the analysis of the complete dataset of six winters of hourly threshold conditions of snow transport from 16 meteorological stations in the canadian prairies li and pomeroy 1997a average threshold wind speeds of 7 7 and 9 9 m s 1 have been documented and were used to identify dry and wet snow transport respectively 1 u t 10 7 7 m s d r y s n o w 9 9 m s w e t s n o w despite threshold wind speed showing considerable spatial variability in previous studies this classification provides approximations of the threshold wind speed and enables easy handling of the initiation of transport knuth et al 2010 2 2 temperature based threshold formula three temperature associated resistance regimes for dry snow transport were observed by analyzing the relationship between ambient air temperature and threshold wind speed measurements at 16 meteorological stations in the canadian prairies li and pomeroy 1997a although observations indicate that the minimum wind speed for blowing snow occurrence varies widely for a given air temperature a nonlinear but typically positive correlation between threshold wind speed and the ambient air temperature was found a simple algorithm using a constant and temperature to describe the threshold wind speed for blowing snow events was then developed for dry snow conditions 2 u t 10 9 43 0 18 t 0 0033 t 2 where u t 10 m s 1 is the threshold wind speed at 10 m height and t c is the air temperature at 2 m height following this relationship the three observed snow resistance regimes for dry snow transport can be represented this threshold formula based on routine meteorological observations provides a practical empirical solution to the threshold wind speed with satisfactory accuracy facilitating its implementation in numerical models for snow transport and sublimation flux estimation e g déry and yau 1999 xie et al 2019 luo et al 2021 2 3 probability estimation method although the threshold wind speeds estimated using air temperature agreed well on average the accuracy of the temperature based threshold formula in estimating the threshold wind speed for individual blowing snow events was poor li and pomeroy 1997a li and pomeroy 1997b investigated the occurrence of blowing snow under various meteorological conditions on a statistical basis their results reveal that the probability of blowing snow occurrence is closely related to wind speed air temperature and snowpack age and the occurrence frequency at a given temperature and snow age approximates a cumulative normal probability distribution furthermore the mean and variance of wind speed independently represent the local and scale parameters of the normal distribution analysis of the probability distributions for the occurrence of blowing snow with respect to wind speed underlies the development of the model in estimating the probability of blowing snow occurrence with wind speed air temperature and snowpack age following the cumulative normal probability function 3 p u 10 t a 1 2 π δ 0 u 10 e x p u u 10 2 2 δ 2 d u where u 10 is the wind speed at 10 m height t is the air temperature a hours is the time since snow deposition and u and δ are the mean and the standard deviation of wind speed respectively this equation can be simplified as 4 p u 10 t a 1 e x p π u u 10 δ 1 the best fit mean and variance of wind speed were obtained for varied temperature and snow age conditions using an automated iterative method to match the estimated and observed frequencies of blowing snow baggaley and hanesiak 2005 the mean and standard deviation of wind speed for dry snow can be estimated using the following method 5 u 0 365 t 0 00706 t 2 0 9 ln a 11 2 6 δ 0 145 t 0 00196 t 2 4 3 for the occurrence of wet icy blowing snow the best fit mean and variance of wind speed were 21 and 49 m s 1 respectively as recommended by li and pomeroy 1997b 2 4 physically based threshold formula the cohesion and bonding resistance of snow particles are largely dependent on the snow aging process schmidt 1982 li and pomeroy 1997b sintering is a physical bonding process between particles driven by thermal processes within the snowpack he and ohara 2017 established a physically based threshold formula for snow transport estimation based on a particle level sintering process model and the momentum balance of snow particles incorporating the sintering mechanism to estimate the cohesive force development among snow particles as well as the effects of snow particle size air temperature and deposition time on the threshold wind speed he and ohara 2017 provide a detailed derivation of the threshold wind speed equations and only the formulas for the threshold shear stress for snow transport and the relationship between the threshold wind speed and threshold shear stress are provided here 7 τ c 8 r c g ρ s ρ α g cos π 3 s c c π σ c r p t 2 q sin π 3 s c r p t 1 q 2 c d sin π 3 s c l c o s π 3 s where 8 s arcsin c r p t 1 q r is the snow sphere

decision tree based method the occurrence of blowing snow varies greatly both spatially and temporally with most of the variance attributed to the difference in wind speed air temperature and the snow particle properties such as density and radius baggaley and hanesiak 2005 despite several studies devoted to detecting the occurrence of blowing snow from a climatological or physical perspective li and pomeroy 1997a 1997b dery and yau 2001 he and ohara 2017 determining the occurrence of blowing snow with sufficient accuracy remains a challenge machine learning based methods in contrast to the above mentioned formulas derived from traditional statistical analysis are free from the need to artificially build complex empirical formulations that are explicitly expressed through particle size disposition time wind speed and air temperature instead a decision tree is constructed using a data driven strategy that does not require understanding of the physical rules that govern blowing snow processes and it continuously improves discrimination strategies based on field observations as a result a machine learning based model to predict the occurrence of blowing snow is theoretically simpler and more flexible than traditional methods based on the long term continuous observations from isaw stations xie et al 2021 constructed decision tree based models to detect blowing snow occurrence using routine meteorological fields hourly mean and maximum wind speed air temperature and relative humidity as feature variables site specific decision tree models and a site independent decision tree model were trained and evaluated and they all performed well in detecting the occurrence of blowing snow this data driven method has been shown to be a promising approach that requires limited meteorological parameters and can be easily transferred to different locations the detailed procedures of feature variable selection model construction and validation can be found in xie et al 2021 in this study we assessed decision tree models constructed based on observations from individual station dtm specific all stations dtm all stations with homogeneous wind speeds dtm homo and

in estimating the occurrence of blowing snow the field observations at nine stations were selected from approximately 30 stations of the isaw network http iswa ch these stations are located in the central french alps and cover an elevation range from 1 800 to 2 869 m table 1 measurements of blowing snow flux as well as routine meteorological fields including wind speed and wind direction air temperature relative humidity and precipitation and snow depth are available at hourly intervals while the meteorological data are measured with 1 min observational interval the near surface wind velocity was measured at 3 5 m height and reported as hourly mean and maximum wind speeds snow flux was recorded by two segments of 1 m long flowcapt acoustic tube chritin et al 1999 although the accuracy of the flowcapt sensor for quantitatively monitoring snow flux has been debated cierco et al 2007 lehning and fierz 2008 the robustness of flowcapt to sustain years of usage in harsh situations while consuming little power makes it a promising detector to monitor the occurrence of blowing snow trouvilliez et al 2015 3 2 data pre processing because of abundant snowfall throughout the winter the flowcapt sensor may be partially buried under snow although the sensors can still operate once it remains partially exposed changes in the exposed length affect the measurement of the blowing snow mass flux as the estimation is based on a log law assumption with the mass flux of snow integrated vertically over the exposed length of the instrument therefore amory 2020 recommended adopting an exposed length based correction processes to reduce potential uncertainty despite making adjustments to the measured snow mass flux the occurrence of blowing snow was determined based on the signal of the flowcapt a 1 0 g m 2s 1 confidence threshold is commonly used to remove non significant event e g trouvilliez et al 2015 amory 2020 and a blowing snow event was defined as when blowing snow mass flux exceeded the confidence threshold for at least two consecutive hours the threshold wind speed for blowing snow occurrence was acquired to compare with the estimated threshold wind speeds referring to the method of li and pomeroy 1997a the wind speed and air temperature of the previous hour and the hour when blowing snow was observed to begin were averaged and taken as the threshold observed wind speed and air temperature several quality control procedures were applied to the observations to minimize the uncertainty in the observations a threshold check and consistency check were performed for the mean and maximum wind speed air temperature and snow depth for example data with air temperature outside possible range 50 to 50 c or maximum wind speed greater than 40 m s 1 were considered unreliable and were discarded furthermore periods when both the mean and maximum wind speed were zero for more than 3 consecutive hours or non zero wind speed remain unchanged for more than 5 h were also removed besides we performed manual inspection on the synergistic changes among multiple meteorological elements through the interactive interface of the data website https isaw ch suspicious data were discarded evidence suggests that the reliability of the flowcapt instrument is limited in quantitative estimation of snow fluxes cierco et al 2007 the flowcapt is still efficient blowing snow detector trouvilliez et al 2015 when the observations were regarded as index measurements rather than accurate and quantitative and its measurements can be used index flux measurements cierco et al 2007 lehning and fierz 2008 anomalous signals induced by soil particle collision are a major source of uncertainty for identifying blowing snow occurrences as it is challenging to distinguish blowing snow from signals mixed with soil particle collisions vionnet et al 2018 xie et al 2021 besides there were a few cases of blowing snow with snowpacks that had undergone significant melting or with none of the prerequisites for blowing snow occurrence being met the measured snow flux in these cases was advected from a distant location which could not be identified using point observations therefore we assume that blowing snow is unlikely to occur in the periods when the surface is absent of snow cover and without concurrent snowfall or when positive air temperature persists for longer than 24 h records in these situations were categorized as non blowing snow occurrences even non zero snow mass flux was detected the surface snow cover status was obtained using snow depth observations from ultrasonic sensors and the modis snow cover product hall and riggs 2021a 2021b was used for auxiliary observations when in situ snow depth observations were unavailable 3 3 data classification due to the impacts of liquid precipitation and the freeze thaw process there is a clear distinction between the snow particle bonding and cohesion of dry and wet snow as a result separate treatment of the blowing snow occurrences for dry snow cover and wet icy snow cover were employed in some schemes such as the constant and pro to discriminate between dry and wet snow quality controlled air temperature precipitation and snow depth records were used because surface temperature is not available at isaw stations air temperature was used as a substitute three snow cover scenarios were established based on the ambient meteorological conditions snowfall sf surface covered by wet snow without concurrent snowfall nosf wet and surface covered by dry snow without concurrent snowfall nosf dry snowfall was distinguished from rainfall by applying a threshold to temperature 0 c in this case dry snow refers to snow that has neither received liquid precipitation nor been exposed to positive air temperature since the last snowfall wet snow is defined here as snow that has either been exposed to air temperatures exceeding 0 c or which has received liquid precipitation since the last snowfall li and pomeroy 1997a 3 4 evaluation metrics the accuracy of the parameterization schemes with varying complexity in estimating blowing snow occurrence was investigated using dichotomous contingency tables table 2 a set of evaluation metrics can be derived based on the contingency table elements defined in table 2 to evaluate model performance in blowing snow detection the overall agreement between the observations and simulations was quantified using the overall accuracy oa index the probability of detection pod and the false alarm ratio far 10 oa a d a b c d 11 pod a a c 12 far b a b the pod is defined as the ratio of estimated blowing snow occurrences to the total blowing snow observations whereas the far is defined as the number of false alarms divided by the number of forecasted events the oa pod and far range from 0 to 1 with 1 being a perfect score for oa and pod and 0 a perfect score for far the heidke skill score hss is a metric suitable for evaluating forecasts of rare events and here it was used for characterizing the dichotomous contingency table the hss ranges between 1 and 1 with 1 for a perfect simulation 0 for a random forecast and a negative value for a forecast worse than a random forecast vioneet et al 2018 13 hss 2 a d b c a c c d a b b d 3 5 evaluation dataset to objectively present the performance of decision tree models observations used in constructing models cannot be reused for model evaluation therefore when all schemes were intercompared section 4 1 the evaluation strategy used in xie et al 2021 was applied more specifically 20 repetitions of random sub sampling validation method were applied with an optimal ratio of 0 8 between the training and evaluation dataset and thus 20 evaluation datasets were sampled and used to evaluate the schemes with varying complexity metrics calculated from each evaluation dataset were then averaged for intercomparison however when evaluating each scheme in further detail from section 4 2 to 4 5 all available observations were used as evaluation dataset 4 results 4 1 general intercomparison the performances of different types of schemes with varying complexity in estimating blowing snow occurrence were quantitatively assessed and intercompared using four evaluation metrics pod oa far and hss and associated scores the probability estimation method characterizes the probability of blowing snow occurrence for a given wind speed temperature and snowpack age but when compared to other deterministic estimation methods it is necessary to categorize the probability as binary yes or no states to judge whether a blowing snow event occurs consequently different probability thresholds ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 with an interval of 0 1 were used to determine the occurrence of blowing snow only the results at a probability threshold of 0 5 were compared in this section others will be analyzed in section 4 4 because the physically based threshold formula he defines the threshold wind speed as a function of snow particle size its performance was assessed separately for snow particle sizes of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 mm the results obtained with a radius of 0 6 mm were compared in this section and others will be analyzed in section 4 5 the evaluation was performed separately at each station the performance score of each scheme was assigned by ranking the respective corresponding value at each station and then averaging across all stations to represent the overall accuracy the pound sign in fig 1 indicates that the dtm homo or dtm inhomo was trained using partial observations from the corresponding station and thus the associated observations were not used for assessment generally the decision tree based models outperformed other methods in identifying blowing snow events with at least 51 of the observed blowing snow being accurately detected except for the fgie station in terms of the performance averaged across all stations the decision tree based models can identify at least 55 of blowing snow events the proportion was 74 for the dtm all the probability estimation method with a 0 5 probability threshold yielded the lowest pod 0 12 which was much lower than the comparatively simple t based and constant methods 0 42 and 0 43 respectively because of their proficiency in detecting non events the oa of these methods were around 0 9 although the oa varied largely among stations its differences among methods were minimal the methods with a higher pod estimated too many false alerts causing the utility to suffer greatly as a result of crying wolf since there is a disagreement between the pod and far in such cases hss is a crucial metric that can be used to summarize the estimation accuracy this is because hss measures the skill of predictions using hits correct negatives misses and incorrectly predicted hits in terms of hss the overall performance of the decision tree models was higher than that of other conventional methods and unsurprisingly the dtm specific model constructed based on respective observations of each station had the highest hss among the decision tree models the above summary is simply an overview of the different types of methods for detecting blowing snow occurrences more extensive and in depth analyses of each method will be provided in the following sections 4 2 evaluation of the constant threshold scheme snow transport occurs with a given wind and snow condition while other instances of similar circumstances does not the proportion of occurrences of significant blowing snow for a given condition in terms of snow type and wind speed was quantitatively illustrated with the credibility index cred 14 cred p p n where p is the number of blowing snow events for a given wind speed range and n is the number of non events within that range cred was extracted from the quality controlled meteorological dataset at 1 m s 1 wind speed intervals fig 2 shows the cred distribution for the observed and estimated blowing snow events under dry and wet snow cover conditions the observed frequency of occurrence generally increases with wind speed and typically resembles a cumulative normal distribution consistent with previous results baggaley and hanesiak 2005 amory 2020 and especially noticeable for dry snow transport dry snow was more prone to transport than wet snow for a given wind speed a sharp increase of estimated occurrence frequency from 0 to 1 was observed within a very small range around the constant threshold wind speeds 7 7 and 9 9 m s 1 for dry and wet snow respectively and no blowing snow was detected cred 0 for wind speeds below the threshold all wind speeds above the threshold were associated with blowing snow occurrences cred 1 this pattern was notably different from the observed characteristics of blowing snow occurrences the box plots in fig 3 summarize the distribution of the mean and maximum wind speed with six basic statistics the lower 1 the lower quartile median the upper quartile the upper 1 and the mean based on the distribution features of the mean and maximum wind speed at each station stations were categorized as low wind speed low or high wind speed high the fber fgie fmon and fcel stations have very moderate wind speeds whereas the remainder are high wind speed stations as shown in fig 3 the mean and maximum wind speeds were closer at the fber fgie fmon and fcel stations with all basic statistics being much lower than respective values at the high wind speed stations fig 2 also shows the observed and simulated occurrence frequency at relatively low wind speed low relatively high wind speed high and all stations mix underestimation was more prominent at stations with relatively low wind speeds particularly for dry snow transport but overestimation was common when estimating wet snow transport 4 3 evaluation of the temperature based threshold formula as the exact wind speed at the start of blowing snow events was not available from the field observation dataset the threshold wind speed for snow transport was approximated by averaging the wind speed of the previous hour and the hour when the event was detected to occur as described by li and pomeroy 1997a fig 4 compares the observed threshold wind speeds the minimum mean and maximum and the estimated threshold wind speeds based on eq 2 along with air temperature at 0 5 c intervals the observed mean threshold wind speed was provided to demonstrate the overall characteristics of the threshold wind speed within a temperature range while the minimum and maximum threshold wind speeds were used to illustrate the variability of threshold wind speeds within that range as shown in fig 4 the calculated threshold wind speed based on eq 2 shows a gradual increase with increasing temperature from 16 to 0 c whereas the observed wind speed thresholds varied considerably with air temperature and a generally wider variability was found within a given temperature range as the temperature increases notably the distribution of threshold wind speed variation with ambient air temperature was identical to the result of li and pomeroy 1997a the estimated threshold wind speeds were higher than the mean observed threshold wind speeds for all temperature ranges at most stations at fgie station the estimated threshold wind speed was often higher than the maximum observed wind threshold the wide variation range of threshold wind speed for a given temperature suggests that characterizing the occurrence of blowing snow based merely on air temperature is insufficiently effective the relationship between the occurrence frequency of blowing snow and air temperature was not consistent across stations both for observations and estimations as illustrated in fig 5 blowing snow was overestimated at the fmor station throughout the temperature ranges while the temperature based model overestimated blowing snow occurrence at relatively low temperatures at the fhue and fcmb stations and underestimated blowing snow at other stations throughout the temperature ranges the relationship between the observed and estimated changes in blowing snow frequency throughout the temperature range was closely related to the difference between the observed and predicted critical threshold wind speeds shown in fig 4 an overestimation of the threshold wind speed corresponds to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency and vice versa besides the uncertainty in identifying the snow transport with concurrent snowfall should not be neglected figure not show because of the apparent discrepancy in snow properties e g density snow particle cohesion and bonding resistance between fresh snow and aged snow li and pomeroy 1997a vionnet et al 2013 a distinct treatment of snow transport for fresh snow and aged snow is required 4 4 evaluation of the probability estimation method fig 6 shows the accuracy of the probability estimation method with various probability thresholds for detecting blowing snow occurrences generally the number of blowing snow occurrences that were accurately detected decreased as the probability threshold increased resulting in a decreasing pod and accompanying decreases in far oa and hss although variation in the probability threshold had a minimal effect on oa its implications for pod far and hss need attention even though relatively low probability thresholds correspond to relatively high pod oa and hss the method predicted too many false alarms with the use of a lower probability threshold this is a critical issue that should be seriously considered when selecting an optimum probability threshold for snow transport detection if 0 1 was used as the probability threshold the utility of the probability estimation method may be harmed by crying wolf or by identifying too many false alarms therefore 0 5 was used in this study to compare the results with other schemes and for subsequent analysis eq 4 quantifies the probability of blowing snow occurrences as a function of the temperature wind speed and deposition time since the previous snowfall figs 7 and 8 show the variations of observed and estimated frequency of snow transport for dry and wet snow along with wind speed and ambient air temperature respectively for wind speeds lower than 12 m s 1 the snow transport for dry snow was generally underestimated fig 7 i e the estimated probability for blowing snow occurrences was frequently lower than the probability threshold thereby misrepresenting the observed occurrence frequency within that wind speed range however the cred for estimation was larger than the observations for relatively high wind speeds and blowing snow was inevitable for a wind speed higher than 14 m s 1 based on the probability estimation method snow transport was never detected for wind speeds lower than 7 m s 1 but in reality the observed percentage of blowing snow occurrence ranged from 0 to 31 5 with an increase in wind speed and this percentage varied across stations according to eq 4 a wind speed of 21 m s 1 is required to reach a probability of 50 with wet snow however a blowing snow event can be accurately detected by the probability model only when the wind speed exceeds 21 m s 1 moreover a steep rise in the cred from 0 to 1 was observed within a narrow wind speed range for wet snow transport which can be attributed to the default empirical variance of wind speed used as the variance of wind speed controls the rate at which the occurrence probability changes with changing wind speed li and pomeroy 1997b the contrasting patterns of cred distribution with air temperature between observations and estimates show that the probability estimation method failed to detect the actual occurrence of snow transport throughout the ambient air temperature ranges with substantial underestimates particularly at relatively high temperatures in addition wet snow transport was rarely detected all these results imply that the mean and variance of wind speed which are the location and scale parameters for the normal distribution of the probability occurrence of blowing snow are ineffective for characterizing the occurrence of blowing snow 4 5 evaluation of the physically based threshold formula fig 9 indicates that an improved performance of the physically based threshold formula in identifying blowing snow occurrence was achieved when a larger snow particle size was used the model generally performed better at high wind speed stations than at low wind speed stations in terms of pod oa and hss but with a significantly higher far fig 9b an obvious overestimation of the threshold wind speed is shown in table 3 for various snow particle sizes when compared to field observations model overestimation was more severe at smaller particle sizes table 3 the observed threshold wind speeds at low wind speed stations were much lower than those at high wind speed stations while there was no significant difference between the estimates for low wind speed stations and high wind speed stations resulting in limited ability to identify the occurrence of blowing snow in low wind speed stations fig 9a the far in these stations was also much lower fig 9b the observed frequency distribution for snow transport as well as corresponding estimations based on the 0 6 mm snow radii are presented in fig 10 along with ambient air temperature and wind speed snow transport was never detected by the he scheme for wind speeds less than 7 m s 1 and the estimated frequency of blowing snow occurrences was lower than the observations for relatively low wind speeds within 9 to 10 m s 1 for the vast majority of stations but below 8 m s 1 for the fmor station with a difference of up to 0 3 for relatively high wind speeds there was a good agreement between the observed and estimated frequency except for the fmor station regarding the variations of occurrence frequency with air temperature the estimated blowing snow occurrence exhibited a strong dependence on temperature although this relationship was not evident in observations the frequency of snow transport at relatively high temperatures was greatly underestimated and there was a clear overestimation for low temperatures the he scheme performed consistently in characterizing the occurrence of blowing snow at low wind speed high wind speed and all stations with an overestimation for temperatures below 12 5 c and an underestimation for temperatures ranging from 12 5 to 0 c even though the air temperature range at which the estimated occurrence frequency was in accordance with the observed occurrence frequency varied considerably across stations 4 6 evaluation of the decision tree based model xie et al 2021 investigated the effectiveness of decision tree based models in detecting blowing snow occurrences this section focuses on differences in accuracy between four decision tree models constructed following different strategies in general the decision tree based models outperform traditional schemes in terms of both oa and hss in detecting the observed occurrence of blowing snow fig 1b and 1d because of the highest purity of the training data the model constructed based on individual site observations is undoubtedly best at detecting snow transport at the corresponding station the dtm inhomo model which was trained using as many records as possible from low wind speed stations also performed well particularly at identifying the actual blowing snow events for example the pods for fhue and fgie were 0 68 and 0 37 when the dtm inhomo model was used but only 0 57 and 0 3 when the decision tree model was trained based on observations from the high wind speed station dtm homo hss also revealed contrasting performance between the dtm homo and dtm inhomo models for example the dtm inhomo had an hss of 0 85 and 0 47 at fber and fgie stations respectively which was much higher than dtm homo 0 68 and 0 42 respectively this result indicates the large spatial variability in the feature variables significantly influence the model s ability in identifying blowing snow occurrences the intercomparison of decision tree models trained with different strategies highlights the benefit of using an informative training dataset with diverse conditions where transport of snow occurred and it is a necessary prerequisite for accurate detection of blowing snow occurrence on a larger scale 5 discussion as previously stated the constant threshold wind speed scheme generally overestimates the frequency of snow transport when the wind speed exceeds the thresholds for high wind speed stations while the underestimation is noticeable at wind speeds below the thresholds for low wind speed stations this results in a relatively high far for high wind speed stations and a low far for low wind speed stations as well as the high pod for fmor and fcmb stations and the low pod for fgie and fcel stations respectively furthermore the observed frequency of blowing snow occurrence at low wind speed stations is higher than that of corresponding high wind speed stations these results suggest that the constant threshold wind speed scheme can neither accurately portray the change in frequency of actual blowing snow occurrences as a function of wind speed nor capture the spatial variation in frequency the first issue arises because this method treats the occurrence of blowing snow as a 0 1 problem without considering the variation in occurrence frequency with respect to wind speed while the second issue is due to the contrasting distribution patterns of wind speed in space wind speed is not the only factor that influences the blowing snow occurrences but this method neglects the effects of other factors for example vegetation and topographic essery and pomeroy 2004 the type of snow resulting from air temperature and precipitation changes blowing snow leading to snow compaction van kampenhout et al 2017 which may also influence the subsequent occurrence frequency of blowing snow because of persistent strong winds an example of this is the difference in cred variations between the fmor station fig 2a and other high wind speed stations the pod at high wind speed stations was generally higher than that at low wind speed stations when the temperature based threshold formula was used as the estimation of threshold wind speed was based only on air temperature this method might theoretically identify more blowing snow occurrence at high wind speed stations than at low wind speed stations throughout the temperature range resulting in an excessive number of false alarms this indicates that the temperature based threshold formula should account for the spatial difference in wind speed and thus requiring the optimization of key parameters using historical in situ observations however the spatial extrapolation and application of this method will be further limited the temperature based technique is a more rational approach to identify the occurrence of blowing snow from the perspective of physical conditions than the constant threshold wind speed scheme however the performances of both schemes were similar across stations and both are incapable of handling spatial differences in blowing snow occurrence resulting from spatial differences in wind speed characteristics high wind speed stations may not always correspond to a high frequency of blowing snow occurrence because of the effect of blowing snow on snow compaction van kampenhout et al 2017 therefore historical information on wind speed and blowing snow occurrence should be considered the probability model estimates the probability distribution of blowing snow occurrence from a statistical perspective but with physical basis the model characterizes the potential probability of blowing snow occurrence as a function of wind speed air temperature and snow age this scheme is better suited to probabilistic rather than deterministic prediction because there is a minimum amount of uncertainty that we must tolerate when converting the probability estimation into blowing snow occurrence although the model agrees well with observations in the region where the model was calibrated li and pomeroy 1997b it has major problems when applied to other regions the most important issue is the shape of the normal distribution which is determined by two key parameters the mean and variance of wind speed on the one hand both of these parameters are determined by either fitting the estimated occurrence frequency to observations or by using a constant value therefore they are unable to capture the strong spatial heterogeneity of wind speed characteristics and blowing snow occurrence one thing to note here is that the constant t based and pro scheme are proposed based on the relative frequency of observed transport threshold wind speed they may agree well on an average basis but they are unable to accurately estimate the threshold wind speed at hourly scale as the threshold wind speed varies considerable even with the same ambient circumstances local scale meteorological environmental conditions have a significant impact on the occurrence of blowing snow contributing to the great spatial variability of blowing snow occurrence fig 7 the determination of mean wind speed on the other hand is related to air temperature and snow age in practice however determining the snow age based on routine meteorological observations is a major source of uncertainty as even minor changes of air temperature above or below freeze point and the type of precipitation rainfall or snowfall can result in considerable changes in snow age furthermore gusty conditions favor the occurrence of blowing snow as opposed persistent strong wind conditions which may result in obvious wind hardening and thus restrain the occurrence of blowing snow according to helgason and pomeroy 2012a helgason and pomeroy 2012b alpine environments experience far more gustiness than the canadian prairies where the probability algorithm was devised since it is not feasible to transfer blowing snow algorithms to different geographical regions recalibration using local field observations is therefore essential as the shape parameters of the normal distribution exhibit significant spatial variation moreover by including a gust factor and some statistic regarding wind hardening of the surface we can better illustrate the impact of gustiness on threshold condition for blowing snow occurrences this method is less reliable and effective than the constant threshold wind speed scheme and temperature based threshold wind speed scheme in areas lacking historical blowing snow observations the he scheme detected a low occurrence of blowing snow particularly at low wind speed stations the overall accuracy of this scheme was barely satisfactory with only slightly higher pod and hss than the probability algorithm the biggest issue with this method at present is the overestimation of the threshold wind speed in practical applications characterizing the snow particle size distribution is a challenge the restrictions in the distribution of snow particle size with height according to he and ohara 2017 prohibit the scheme from being widely accepted in practical applications besides as two empirical parameters in the sintering process are used in the proposed formula and scheme is also sensitive to several other parameters e g snow particle radius and drag coefficient these factors might contribute a significant uncertainty to the estimation of threshold wind speed for snow movement however the overall performance of the model is insensitive to the snow particle size as demonstrated in fig 9 it is necessary to calibrate the key parameters using a different objective function as well as to investigate the impacts of the key parameters on the model s accuracy in detecting blowing snow the decision tree based models outperformed other traditional schemes regardless of the strategy employed to train them however we note that the utility of the decision tree model was greatly impaired by its forecasting of too many false alarms as well as the spatial extrapolation capabilities of the model trained with different strategies for example when the dtm specific model was applied to stations other than the training station its accuracy suffered a sharp decline xie et al 2021 furthermore when it came to detecting the blowing snow occurrence for low wind speed stations the decision tree model constructed based on observations only from high wind speed stations dtm homo was less successful than the models constructed based on observations from both low and high wind speed stations dtm inhomo and dtm all as decision tree model is a data driven algorithm built on the maximization if inclusivity its performance relies heavily on the training dataset e g representativeness heterogeneity and class imbalance because of its limited potential for handling heterogeneous data and transfer learning spatial temporal extrapolation choosing an effective training dataset with sufficient information is a prerequisite to guarantee the accuracy of the model moreover black box models combined with machine learning algorithms differ from those interpretable physically based models their lack of interpretability is posing a problem and it needs sufficient attention but fortunately efforts have been made to make machine learning model interpretable and explainable 6 summary the performances of five different parameterizations with varying degrees of complexity in estimating the occurrence of blowing snow across the central french alps were evaluated in this study performances were quantified using four evaluation metrics i e pod oa far and hss at varied wind speed and temperature intervals in an attempt to reveal the current status of the various blowing snow occurrence detection schemes the major conclusion can be summarized as follows traditional approaches recognized far less snow transport than that in the observations with less than half of blowing snow events accurately detected at most stations the comparatively sophisticated methods i e he scheme and pro were less capable of detecting blowing snow occurrences than the basic methods i e constant and t based which might be attributed to inappropriate parameter values there was a noticeable difference between the high and low wind speed stations more specifically the proportion of accurately identified blowing snow occurrences was higher at the high wind speed stations whereas more snow transport was falsely detected traditional models assessed in this study were unable to account for the spatial difference in blowing snow occurrence the ability of the decision tree based models to accurately detect the occurrence of blowing snow is generally high and the difference in performance at high wind speed stations and low wind speed stations was not as significant as that for traditional methods this difference can also be reduced by including information on the occurrence of blowing snow at low wind speed stations however regardless of the strategy employed by the decision tree model this model estimated far too many false alarms both the constant scheme and the t based scheme are simple and effective methods for identifying snow movement although their overall accuracy are far from satisfactory while comparatively sophisticated methods i e he scheme and pro have a solid physical basis their ability to accurately identify blowing snow events remains limit the data driven based decision tree model provides advantages in detecting snow transport but with a high false alarm rate each parameterization assessed in the study has advantages and disadvantages the spatial variability of wind speed can result in considerable spatial variability in the occurrence of blowing snow which cannot be captured by traditional methods parameterization adjustment parameter calibration and optimization are therefore necessary and considering the impact of gustness on threshold condition might facilitate the estimation of blowing snow occurrences data availability statement observation data from the isaw stations can be accessed at https www iav ch credit

2094,blowing snow has a major impact on the spatial temporal evolution of snow cover an accurate prediction of the initiation of snow particle movement is one of the prerequisites for blowing snow modeling previous studies have proposed varied complexity parameterizations to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow however a quantitative evaluation of the performance of different schemes in blowing snow identification remains lacking particularly outside the regions where empirical schemes were proposed this study details a comparative study of the performance of five distinct parameterizations with varying degrees of complexity in estimating the occurrence of blowing snow over the central french alps our results show that less than half of blowing snow events can be accurately detected at most stations by traditional schemes for example the constant and temperature based empirical threshold wind speed schemes probability estimation and physically based methods in addition the spatial variability of wind speed can result in considerable spatial variability in the occurrence of blowing snow which cannot be captured by traditional methods decision tree based models can detect blowing snow occurrences with higher accuracy and the spatial variation in snow transport can be captured by including information on blowing snow occurrences at low wind speed stations however regardless of the training strategies employed the decision tree based model employed here estimated far too many false alarms this study contributes to blowing snow modeling by presenting the current state of the art and limitations of various schemes for detecting blowing snow occurrences and highlights the importance of parameterization modification key parameter

mountain snowpacks have important influences on the hydrological cycle ecosystems and climate variability as shown both by observational and by modeling studies mankin et al 2015 musselman et al 2017

density and particle size and vegetation properties gacitúa et al 2013 all these factors make the blowing snow process complex and the initiation of snow particle movement is therefore challenging to estimate on a deterministic and physical basis li and pomeroy 1997b most current physically realistic models neglect or oversimplify the effects of wind redistribution of snow liston 2004 the lack of snow redistribution representation has been identified as a major source of uncertainty in simulations of snow cover evolution mott et al 2018 xie et al 2018 and energy and moisture budgets barral et al 2014 the wind speed at which blowing snow initiates is referred to as the threshold wind speed schmidt 1986 pomeroy and gray 1990 li and pomeroy 1997a this parameter is important in terms of predicting the initiation of snow particle movement because the module for calculating snow transport and sublimation activates only when the wind speed exceeds the threshold wind speed in most current models accurately estimating the threshold wind speed for an initial motion of snow transport is one of the key challenges facing in prediction of the occurrence of blowing snow and quantifying subsequent impacts therefore one of the prerequisites of snow transport modeling is parameterizing the initiation of snow particle movement which has a profound implications for the thermodynamic structure of the planetary boundary layer bintanja 2001 yang and yau 2011 palm et al 2017 surface water budget bintanja and reijmer 2001 zhou et al 2014 surface radiation budget yamanouchi and kawaguchi 1985 yang et al 2014 and the prevention and control of snow damage baggaley and hanesiak 2005 estimates of the threshold wind speed for blowing snow vary widely between different studies mellor 1965 reported that the threshold wind speed for loose and unbounded snow was typically 3 to 8 m s 1 recorded at 10 m height and wind speeds of 30 m s 1 are required to overcome the freeze thaw process bounded snowpack resistance berg 1986 and schmidt 1982 found that a 1 m height wind speed of 4 to 6 m s 1 about 5 7 to 8 6 m s 1 for 10 m height with roughness length equals to 0 005 m was necessary to initiate snow transport at niwot ridge colorado according to a study of hourly average threshold wind speeds in the canadian prairies li and pomeroy 1997a the majority of recorded speeds range from 7 to 14 m s 1 average of 9 9 m s 1 for wet transport and from 4 to 11 m s 1 average of 7 7 m s 1 for dry snow transport liston et al 2007 identified typical values for the threshold wind speed ranging from 4 to 5 m s 1 at 10 m height for new or slightly aged cold dry snow most earlier studies assumed a constant threshold wind speed despite the acknowledgement of the differences between various snow types which depend on moisture content or deposition time field measurements provide practical information for understanding the physical properties of blowing snow occurrence however because of the contrasting measurement conditions the observed occurrence of blowing snow varies spatially and temporally leading to notable variability in threshold wind speed in different studies most variation is attributable to the differences in wind speed air temperature and characteristics of snow baggaley and hanesiak 2005 therefore the applicability of a constant threshold wind speed in detecting the initiation of snow particle movement outside the observation region may be greatly influenced by these factors xie et al 2021 many empirical formulas have been proposed to describe the relationships between threshold wind speed and snowpack conditions schmidt 1980 identified the influences of ambient air temperature humidity particle size impact force and deposition time on the threshold wind speed and derived a formula that explicitly depicts the snow particle bonding resistance several attempts have been made to link the threshold wind speed with snow metamorphism e g lehning et al 2000 snowpack properties such as snow density e g guyomarc h and mérindol 1998 gallée et al 2001 and bond diameter between snow particles clifton et al 2006 li and pomeroy 1997b concluded that the decisive factors underlying the snow bonding cohesion and frictional properties are related to air temperature and then proposed an empirical solution of the threshold wind speed for the initiation of snow transport using standard surface meteorological observations from 16 meteorological stations in the canadian prairies on the basis that the probability distribution for snow particle movement with regard to wind speed approximates a cumulative normal distribution li and pomeroy 1997b proposed a statistical method to investigate the occurrence of blowing snow these practical empirical solutions together with wind tunnel experiments and field experiment results provided the basis for the development of blowing snow models déry and yau 1999 pomeroy and li 2000 déry and yau 2001 bowling et al 2004 new solutions for the threshold condition of snow movement have been constantly emerging in recent years for example he and ohara 2017 derived a new physically based formula that expresses the threshold wind speed as a function of temperature snow particle radius and snow deposition time with snow sintering taken into account however two empirical parameters in the sintering process were determined through model calibration using field observations of snow flux from the isaw stations detailes in section 3 1 machine learning provides another potential tool to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow an example of this is the application of decision tree based models by xie et al 2021 which were constructed based on routine meteorological observations and applied to detect blowing snow occurrence in the european alps for an realistic estimate of the blowing snow mass flux and its associated impacts precise prediction of blowing snow occurrence is the essential prerequisite a variety of parameterization schemes have been proposed i e constant threshold wind speed temperature based threshold wind

al 2018 etc however uncertainties arising from variances in climatic and environmental conditions as well as the spatial variability of snow properties field validation of parameterizations is necessary to our knowledge although preliminary assessments have evaluated the ability of different blowing snow models in simulating snow redistribution gauer 1998 xiao et al 2000 few relevant comparative analysis of model performance in estimating blowing snow occurrence have been carried out therefore limited perspectives are aviliable to guide the improvement in the blowing snow occurrence detection faced with a diversity of approaches and applications an intercomparison and comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty of different threshold wind speed methods with varying complexity in blowing snow occurrence prediction is undoubtedly of great importance for improving algorithms and thus increasing the reliability of corresponding estimations such a comparison will also provide a valuable scientific reference for model developers decision makers and users e g avalanche forecasters snow safety services etc to our knowledge several issues have yet to be addressed as follows to what extent do current forecast techniques capture the pattern of blowing snow occurrences which factors contribute to the uncertainty in detecting blowing snow occurrence which scheme holds the most promising potential for blowing snow occurrence prediction what special efforts should be made to reduce uncertainties in the prediction of blowing snow for various types of schemes of varying complexity this study aims to answer these questions by assessing and analyzing the ability of different parameterizations in detecting blowing snow occurrences the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces five kinds of blowing snow occurrence estimation techniques with varying complexity section 3 covers the observations and methodology employed in this study which includes the field observations data pre processing data classification and evaluation metrics section 4 focuses on the metrics based analysis of uncertainties section 5 discusses the potential factors attributed to the uncertainty of each scheme and section 6 concludes with a summary and conclusions 2 parameterization description five different methods for detecting snow transport were evaluated against field observations from nine isaw stations three of the five are based on the predicted threshold wind speed one on the estimated occurrence probability and one is data driven although field observations from the isaw network were used in the construction of the physically based threshold formula and the decision tree based method their ability were comprehensively evaluated and compared with other algorithms proposed outside the european alps in an attempt to understand the current state of the art and limitations of these parameterizations 2 1 constant threshold scheme the majority of recorded threshold wind speeds at the height of 10 m range from 7 to 14 m s 1 for wet snow transport and from 4 to 11 m s 1 for dry snow transport according to the analysis of the complete dataset of six winters of hourly threshold conditions of snow transport from 16 meteorological stations in the canadian prairies li and pomeroy 1997a average threshold wind speeds of 7 7 and 9 9 m s 1 have been documented and were used to identify dry and wet snow transport respectively 1 u t 10 7 7 m s d r y s n o w 9 9 m s w e t s n o w despite threshold wind speed showing considerable spatial variability in previous studies this classification provides approximations of the threshold wind speed and enables easy handling of the initiation of transport knuth et al 2010 2 2 temperature based threshold formula three temperature associated resistance regimes for dry snow transport were observed by analyzing the relationship between ambient air temperature and threshold wind speed measurements at 16 meteorological stations in the canadian prairies li and pomeroy 1997a although observations indicate that the minimum wind speed for blowing snow occurrence varies widely for a given air temperature a nonlinear but typically positive correlation between threshold wind speed and the ambient air temperature was found a simple algorithm using a constant and temperature to describe the threshold wind speed for blowing snow events was then developed for dry snow conditions 2 u t 10 9 43 0 18 t 0 0033 t 2 where u t 10 m s 1 is the threshold wind speed at 10 m height and t c is the air temperature at 2 m height following this relationship the three observed snow resistance regimes for dry snow transport can be represented this threshold formula based on routine meteorological observations provides a practical empirical solution to the threshold wind speed with satisfactory accuracy facilitating its implementation in numerical models for snow transport and sublimation flux estimation e g déry and yau 1999 xie et al 2019 luo et al 2021 2 3 probability estimation method although the threshold wind speeds estimated using air temperature agreed well on average the accuracy of the temperature based threshold formula in estimating the threshold wind speed for individual blowing snow events was poor li and pomeroy 1997a li and pomeroy 1997b investigated the occurrence of blowing snow under various meteorological conditions on a statistical basis their results reveal that the probability of blowing snow occurrence is closely related to wind speed air temperature and snowpack age and the occurrence frequency at a given temperature and snow age approximates a cumulative normal probability distribution furthermore the mean and variance of wind speed independently represent the local and scale parameters of the normal distribution analysis of the probability distributions for the occurrence of blowing snow with respect to wind speed underlies the development of the model in estimating the probability of blowing snow occurrence with wind speed air temperature and snowpack age following the cumulative normal probability function 3 p u 10 t a 1 2 π δ 0 u 10 e x p u u 10 2 2 δ 2 d u where u 10 is the wind speed at 10 m height t is the air temperature a hours is the time since snow deposition and u and δ are the mean and the standard deviation of wind speed respectively this equation can be simplified as 4 p u 10 t a 1 e x p π u u 10 δ 1 the best fit mean and variance of wind speed were obtained for varied temperature and snow age conditions using an automated iterative method to match the estimated and observed frequencies of blowing snow baggaley and hanesiak 2005 the mean and standard deviation of wind speed for dry snow can be estimated using the following method 5 u 0 365 t 0 00706 t 2 0 9 ln a 11 2 6 δ 0 145 t 0 00196 t 2 4 3 for the occurrence of wet icy blowing snow the best fit mean and variance of wind speed were 21 and 49 m s 1 respectively as recommended by li and pomeroy 1997b 2 4 physically based threshold formula the cohesion and bonding resistance of snow particles are largely dependent on the snow aging process schmidt 1982 li and pomeroy 1997b sintering is a physical bonding process between particles driven by thermal processes within the snowpack he and ohara 2017 established a physically based threshold formula for snow transport estimation based on a particle level sintering process model and the momentum balance of snow particles incorporating the sintering mechanism to estimate the cohesive force development among snow particles as well as the effects of snow particle size air temperature and deposition time on the threshold wind speed he and ohara 2017 provide a detailed derivation of the threshold wind speed equations and only the formulas for the threshold shear stress for snow transport and the relationship between the threshold wind speed and

decision tree based method the occurrence of blowing snow varies greatly both spatially and temporally with most of the variance attributed to the difference in wind speed air temperature and the snow particle properties such as density and radius baggaley and hanesiak 2005 despite several studies devoted to detecting the occurrence of blowing snow from a climatological or physical perspective li and pomeroy 1997a 1997b dery and yau 2001 he and ohara 2017 determining the occurrence of blowing snow with sufficient accuracy remains a challenge machine learning based methods in contrast to the above mentioned formulas derived from traditional statistical analysis are free from the need to artificially build complex empirical formulations that are explicitly expressed through particle size disposition time wind speed and air temperature instead a decision tree is constructed using a data driven strategy that does not require understanding of the physical rules that govern blowing snow processes and it continuously improves discrimination strategies based on field observations as a result a machine learning based model to predict the occurrence of blowing snow is theoretically simpler and more flexible than traditional methods based on the long term continuous observations from isaw stations xie et al 2021 constructed decision tree based models to detect blowing snow occurrence using routine meteorological fields hourly mean and maximum wind speed air temperature and relative humidity as feature variables site specific decision tree models and a site independent decision tree model were trained and evaluated and they all performed well in detecting the occurrence of blowing snow this data driven method has been shown to be a promising approach that requires limited meteorological parameters and can be easily transferred to different locations the detailed procedures of feature variable selection model construction and validation can be found in xie et al 2021 in this study we assessed decision tree models constructed based on observations from individual station dtm specific all stations dtm all stations with homogeneous wind speeds dtm homo and stations with inhomogeneous wind speeds dtm inhomo constant t based pro nn the number following the underscore indicates the probability threshold used and he scheme are abbreviations for the constant

observation sets are denoted by dtm specific dtm all dtm homo and dtm inhomo 3 data and methods 3 1 field observations field observations were used to evaluate the performance of the parameterizations in estimating the occurrence of blowing snow the field observations at nine stations were selected from approximately 30 stations of the isaw network http iswa ch these stations are located in the central french alps and cover an elevation range from 1 800 to 2 869 m table 1 measurements of blowing snow flux as well as routine meteorological fields including wind speed and wind direction air temperature relative humidity and precipitation and snow depth are available at hourly intervals while the meteorological data are measured with 1 min observational interval the near surface wind velocity was measured at 3 5 m height and reported as hourly mean and maximum wind speeds snow flux was recorded by two segments of 1 m long flowcapt acoustic tube chritin et al 1999 although the accuracy of the flowcapt sensor for quantitatively monitoring snow flux has been debated cierco et al 2007 lehning and fierz 2008 the robustness of flowcapt to sustain years of usage in harsh situations while consuming little power makes it a promising detector to monitor the occurrence of blowing snow trouvilliez et al 2015 3 2 data pre processing because of abundant snowfall throughout the winter the flowcapt sensor may be partially buried under snow although the sensors can still operate once it remains partially exposed changes in the exposed length affect the measurement of the blowing snow mass flux as the estimation is based on a log law assumption with the mass flux of snow integrated vertically over the exposed length of the instrument therefore amory 2020 recommended adopting an exposed length based correction processes to reduce potential uncertainty despite making adjustments to the measured snow mass flux the occurrence of blowing snow was determined based on the signal of the flowcapt a 1 0 g m 2s 1 confidence threshold is commonly used to remove non significant event e g trouvilliez et al 2015 amory 2020 and a blowing snow event was defined as when blowing snow mass flux exceeded the confidence threshold for at least two consecutive hours the threshold wind speed for blowing snow occurrence was acquired to compare with the estimated threshold wind speeds referring to the method of li and pomeroy 1997a the wind speed and air temperature of the previous hour and the hour when blowing snow was observed to begin were averaged and taken as the threshold observed wind speed and air temperature several quality control procedures were applied to the observations to minimize the uncertainty in the observations a threshold check and consistency check were performed for the mean and maximum wind speed air temperature and snow depth for example data with air temperature outside possible range 50 to 50 c or maximum wind speed greater than 40 m s 1 were considered unreliable and were discarded furthermore periods when both the mean and maximum wind speed were zero for more than 3 consecutive hours or non zero wind speed remain unchanged for more than 5 h were also removed besides we performed manual inspection on the synergistic changes among multiple meteorological elements through the interactive interface of the data website https isaw ch suspicious data were discarded evidence suggests that the reliability of the flowcapt instrument is limited in quantitative estimation of snow fluxes cierco et al 2007 the flowcapt is still efficient blowing snow detector trouvilliez et al 2015 when the observations were regarded as index measurements rather than accurate and quantitative and its measurements can be used index flux measurements cierco et al 2007 lehning and fierz 2008 anomalous signals induced by soil particle collision are a major source of uncertainty for identifying blowing snow occurrences as it is challenging to distinguish blowing snow from signals mixed with soil particle collisions vionnet et al 2018 xie et al 2021 besides there were a few cases of blowing snow with snowpacks that had undergone significant melting or with none of the prerequisites for blowing snow occurrence being met the measured snow flux in these cases was advected from a distant location which could not be identified using point observations therefore we assume that blowing snow is unlikely to occur in the periods when the surface is absent of snow cover and without concurrent snowfall or when positive air temperature persists for longer than 24 h records in these situations were categorized as non blowing snow occurrences even non zero snow mass flux was detected the surface snow cover status was obtained using snow depth observations from ultrasonic sensors and the modis snow cover product hall and riggs 2021a 2021b was used for auxiliary observations when in situ snow depth observations were unavailable 3 3 data classification due to the impacts of liquid precipitation and the freeze thaw process there is a clear distinction between the snow particle bonding and cohesion of dry and wet snow as a result separate treatment of the blowing snow occurrences for dry snow cover and wet icy snow cover were employed in some schemes such as the constant and pro to discriminate between dry and wet snow quality controlled air temperature precipitation and snow depth records were used because surface temperature is not available at isaw stations air temperature was used as a substitute three snow cover scenarios were established based on the ambient meteorological conditions snowfall sf surface covered by wet snow without concurrent snowfall nosf wet and surface covered by dry snow without concurrent snowfall nosf dry snowfall was distinguished from rainfall by applying a threshold to temperature 0 c in this case dry snow refers to snow that has neither received liquid precipitation nor been exposed to positive air temperature since the last snowfall wet snow is defined here as snow that has either been exposed to air temperatures exceeding 0 c or which has received liquid precipitation since the last snowfall li and pomeroy 1997a 3 4 evaluation metrics the accuracy of the parameterization schemes with varying complexity in estimating blowing snow occurrence was investigated using dichotomous contingency tables table 2 a set of evaluation metrics can be derived based on the contingency table elements defined in table 2 to evaluate model performance in blowing snow detection the overall agreement between the observations and simulations was quantified using the overall accuracy oa index the probability of detection pod and the false alarm ratio far 10 oa a d a b c d 11 pod a a c 12 far b a b the pod is defined as the ratio of estimated blowing snow occurrences to the total blowing snow observations whereas the far is defined as the number of false alarms divided by the number of forecasted events the oa pod and far range from 0 to 1 with 1 being a perfect score for oa and pod and 0 a perfect score for far the heidke skill score hss is a metric suitable for evaluating forecasts of rare events and here it was used for characterizing the dichotomous contingency table the hss ranges between 1 and 1 with 1 for a perfect simulation 0 for a random forecast and a negative value for a forecast worse than a random forecast vioneet et al 2018 13 hss 2 a d b c a c c d a b b d 3 5 evaluation dataset to objectively present the performance of decision tree models observations used in constructing models cannot be reused for model evaluation therefore when all schemes were intercompared section 4 1 the evaluation strategy used in xie et al 2021 was applied more specifically 20 repetitions of random sub sampling validation method were applied with an optimal ratio of 0 8 between the training and evaluation dataset and thus 20 evaluation datasets were sampled and used to evaluate the schemes with varying complexity metrics calculated from each evaluation dataset were then averaged for intercomparison however when evaluating each scheme in further detail from section 4 2 to 4 5 all available observations were used as evaluation dataset 4 results 4 1 general intercomparison the performances of different types of schemes with varying complexity in estimating blowing snow occurrence were quantitatively assessed and intercompared using four evaluation metrics pod oa far and hss and associated scores the probability estimation method characterizes the probability of blowing snow occurrence for a given wind speed temperature and snowpack age but when compared to other deterministic estimation methods it is necessary to categorize the probability as binary yes or no states to judge whether a blowing snow event occurs consequently different probability thresholds ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 with an interval of 0 1 were used to determine the occurrence of blowing snow only the results at a probability threshold of 0 5 were compared in this section others will be analyzed in section 4 4 because the physically based threshold formula he defines the threshold wind speed as a function of snow particle size its performance was assessed separately for snow particle sizes of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 mm the results obtained with a radius of 0 6 mm were compared in this section and others will be analyzed in section 4 5 the evaluation was performed separately at each station the performance score of each scheme was assigned by ranking the respective corresponding value at each station and then averaging across all stations to represent the overall accuracy the pound sign in fig 1 indicates that the dtm homo or dtm inhomo was trained using partial observations from the corresponding station and thus the associated observations were not used for assessment generally the decision tree based models outperformed other methods in identifying blowing snow events with at least 51 of the observed blowing snow being accurately detected except for the fgie station in terms of the performance averaged across all stations the decision tree based models can identify at least 55 of blowing snow events the proportion was 74 for the dtm all the probability estimation method with a 0 5 probability threshold yielded the lowest pod 0 12 which was much lower than the comparatively simple t based and constant methods 0 42 and 0 43 respectively because of their proficiency in detecting non events the oa of these methods were around 0 9 although the oa varied largely among stations its differences among methods were minimal the methods with a higher pod estimated too many false alerts causing the utility to suffer greatly as a result of crying wolf since there is a disagreement between the pod and far in such cases hss is a crucial metric that can be used to summarize the estimation accuracy this is because hss measures the skill of predictions using hits correct negatives misses and incorrectly predicted hits in terms of hss the overall performance of the decision tree models was higher than that of other conventional methods and unsurprisingly the dtm specific model constructed based on respective observations of each station had the highest hss among the decision tree models the above summary is simply an overview of the different types of methods for detecting blowing snow occurrences more extensive and in depth analyses of each method will be provided in the following sections 4 2 evaluation of the constant threshold scheme snow transport occurs with a given wind and snow condition while other instances of similar circumstances does not the proportion of occurrences of significant blowing snow for a given condition in terms of snow type and wind speed was quantitatively illustrated with the credibility index cred 14 cred p p n where p is the number of blowing snow events for a given wind speed range and n is the number of non events within that range cred was extracted from the quality controlled meteorological dataset at 1 m s 1 wind speed intervals fig 2 shows the cred distribution for the observed and estimated blowing snow events under dry and wet snow cover conditions the observed frequency of occurrence generally increases with wind speed and typically resembles a cumulative normal distribution consistent with previous results baggaley and hanesiak 2005 amory 2020 and especially noticeable for dry snow transport dry snow was more prone to transport than wet snow for a given wind speed a sharp increase of estimated occurrence frequency from 0 to 1 was observed within a very small range around the constant threshold wind speeds 7 7 and 9 9 m s 1 for dry and wet snow respectively and no blowing snow was detected cred 0 for wind speeds below the threshold all wind speeds above the threshold were associated with blowing snow occurrences cred 1 this pattern was notably different from the observed characteristics of blowing snow occurrences the box plots in fig 3 summarize the distribution of the mean and maximum wind speed with six basic statistics the lower 1 the lower quartile median the upper quartile the upper 1 and the mean based on the distribution features of the mean and maximum wind speed at each station stations were categorized as low wind speed low or high wind speed high the fber fgie fmon and fcel stations have very moderate wind speeds whereas the remainder are high wind speed stations as shown in fig 3 the mean and maximum wind speeds were closer at the fber fgie fmon and fcel stations with all basic statistics being much lower than respective values at the high wind speed stations fig 2 also shows the observed and simulated occurrence frequency at relatively low wind speed low relatively high wind speed high and all stations mix underestimation was more prominent at stations with relatively low wind speeds particularly for dry snow transport but overestimation was common when estimating wet snow transport 4 3 evaluation of the temperature based threshold formula as the exact wind speed at the start of blowing snow events was not available from the field observation dataset the threshold wind speed for snow transport was approximated by averaging the wind speed of the previous hour and the hour when the event was detected to occur as described by li and pomeroy 1997a fig 4 compares the observed threshold wind speeds the minimum mean and maximum and the estimated threshold wind speeds based on eq 2 along with air temperature at 0 5 c intervals the observed mean threshold wind speed was provided to demonstrate the overall characteristics of the threshold wind speed within a temperature range while the minimum and maximum threshold wind speeds were used to illustrate the variability of threshold wind speeds within that range as shown in fig 4 the calculated threshold wind speed based on eq 2 shows a gradual increase with increasing temperature from 16 to 0 c whereas the observed wind speed thresholds varied considerably with air temperature and a generally wider variability was found within a given temperature range as the temperature increases notably the distribution of threshold wind speed variation with ambient air temperature was identical to the result of li and pomeroy 1997a the estimated threshold wind speeds were higher than the mean observed threshold wind speeds for all temperature ranges at most stations at fgie station the estimated threshold wind speed was often higher than the maximum observed wind threshold the wide variation range of threshold wind speed for a given temperature suggests that characterizing the occurrence of blowing snow based merely on air temperature is insufficiently effective the relationship between the occurrence frequency of blowing snow and air temperature was not consistent across stations both for observations and estimations as illustrated in fig 5 blowing snow was overestimated at the fmor station throughout the temperature ranges while the temperature based model overestimated blowing snow occurrence at relatively low temperatures at the fhue and fcmb stations and underestimated blowing snow at other stations throughout the temperature ranges the relationship between the observed and estimated changes in blowing snow frequency throughout the temperature range was closely related to the difference between the observed and predicted critical threshold wind speeds shown in fig 4 an overestimation of the threshold wind speed corresponds to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency and vice versa besides the uncertainty in identifying the snow transport with concurrent snowfall should not be neglected figure not show because of the apparent discrepancy in snow properties e g density snow particle cohesion and bonding resistance between fresh snow and aged snow li and pomeroy 1997a vionnet et al 2013 a distinct treatment of snow transport for fresh snow and aged snow is required 4 4 evaluation of the probability estimation method fig 6 shows the accuracy of the probability estimation method with various probability thresholds for detecting blowing snow occurrences generally the number of blowing snow occurrences that were accurately detected decreased as the probability threshold increased resulting in a decreasing pod and accompanying decreases in far oa and hss although variation in the probability threshold had a minimal effect on oa its implications for pod far and hss need attention even though relatively low probability thresholds correspond to relatively high pod oa and hss the method predicted too many false alarms with the use of a lower probability threshold this is a critical issue that should be seriously considered when selecting an optimum probability threshold for snow transport detection if 0 1 was used as the probability threshold the utility of the probability estimation method may be harmed by crying wolf or by identifying too many false alarms therefore 0 5 was used in this study to compare the results with other schemes and for subsequent analysis eq 4 quantifies the probability of blowing snow occurrences as a function of the temperature wind speed and deposition time since the previous snowfall figs 7 and 8 show the variations of observed and estimated frequency of snow transport for dry and wet snow along with wind speed and ambient air temperature respectively for wind speeds lower than 12 m s 1 the snow transport for dry snow was generally underestimated fig 7 i e the estimated probability for blowing snow occurrences was frequently lower than the probability threshold thereby misrepresenting the observed occurrence frequency within that wind speed range however the cred for estimation was larger than the observations for relatively high wind speeds and blowing snow was inevitable for a wind speed higher than 14 m s 1 based on the probability estimation method snow transport was never detected for wind speeds lower than 7 m s 1 but in reality the observed percentage of blowing snow occurrence ranged from 0 to 31 5 with an increase in wind speed and this percentage varied across stations according to eq 4 a wind speed of 21 m s 1 is required to reach a probability of 50 with wet snow however a blowing snow event can be accurately detected by the probability model only when the wind speed exceeds 21 m s 1 moreover a steep rise in the cred from 0 to 1 was observed within a narrow wind speed range for wet snow transport which can be attributed to the default empirical variance of wind speed used as the variance of wind speed controls the rate at which the occurrence probability changes with changing wind speed li and pomeroy 1997b the contrasting patterns of cred distribution with air temperature between observations and estimates show that the probability estimation method failed to detect the actual occurrence of snow transport throughout the ambient air temperature ranges with substantial underestimates particularly at relatively high temperatures in addition wet snow transport was rarely detected all these results imply that the mean and variance of wind speed which are the location and scale parameters for the normal distribution of the probability occurrence of blowing snow are ineffective for characterizing the occurrence of blowing snow 4 5 evaluation of the physically based threshold formula fig 9 indicates that an improved performance of the physically based threshold formula in identifying blowing snow occurrence was achieved when a larger snow particle size was used the model generally performed better at high wind speed stations than at low wind speed stations in terms of pod oa and hss but with a significantly higher far fig 9b an obvious overestimation of the threshold wind speed is shown in table 3 for various snow particle sizes when compared to field observations model overestimation was more severe at smaller particle sizes table 3 the observed threshold wind speeds at low wind speed stations were much lower than those at high wind speed stations while there was no significant difference between the estimates for low wind speed stations and high wind speed stations resulting in limited ability to identify the occurrence of blowing snow in low wind speed stations fig 9a the far in these stations was also much lower fig 9b the observed frequency distribution for snow transport as well as corresponding estimations based on the 0 6 mm snow radii are presented in fig 10 along with ambient air temperature and wind speed snow transport was never detected by the he scheme for wind speeds less than 7 m s 1 and the estimated frequency of blowing snow occurrences was lower than the observations for relatively low wind speeds within 9 to 10 m s 1 for the vast majority of stations but below 8 m s 1 for the fmor station with a difference of up to 0 3 for relatively high wind speeds there was a good agreement between the observed and estimated frequency except for the fmor station regarding the variations of occurrence frequency with air temperature the estimated blowing snow occurrence exhibited a strong dependence on temperature although this relationship was not evident in observations the frequency of snow transport at relatively high temperatures was greatly underestimated and there was a clear overestimation for low temperatures the he scheme performed consistently in characterizing the occurrence of blowing snow at low wind speed high wind speed and all stations with an overestimation for temperatures below 12 5 c and an underestimation for temperatures ranging from 12 5 to 0 c even though the air temperature range at which the estimated occurrence frequency was in accordance with the observed occurrence frequency varied considerably across stations 4 6 evaluation of the decision tree based model xie et al 2021 investigated the effectiveness of decision tree based models in detecting blowing snow occurrences this section focuses on differences in accuracy between four decision tree models constructed following different strategies in general the decision tree based models outperform traditional schemes in terms of both oa and hss in detecting the observed occurrence of blowing snow fig 1b and 1d because of the highest purity of the training data the model constructed based on individual site observations is undoubtedly best at detecting snow transport at the corresponding station the dtm inhomo model which was trained using as many records as possible from low wind speed stations also performed well particularly at identifying the actual blowing snow events for example the pods for fhue and fgie were 0 68 and 0 37 when the dtm inhomo model was used but only 0 57 and 0 3 when the decision tree model was trained based on observations from the high wind speed station dtm homo hss also revealed contrasting performance between the dtm homo and dtm inhomo models for example the dtm inhomo had an hss of 0 85 and 0 47 at fber and fgie stations respectively which was much higher than dtm homo 0 68 and 0 42 respectively this result indicates the large spatial variability in the feature variables significantly influence the model s ability in identifying blowing snow occurrences the intercomparison of decision tree models trained with different strategies highlights the benefit of using an informative training dataset with diverse conditions where transport of snow occurred and it is a necessary prerequisite for accurate detection of blowing snow occurrence on a larger scale 5 discussion as previously stated the constant threshold wind speed scheme generally overestimates the frequency of snow transport when the wind speed exceeds the thresholds for high wind speed stations while the underestimation is noticeable at wind speeds below the thresholds for low wind speed stations this results in a relatively high far for high wind speed stations and a low far for low wind speed stations as well as the high pod for fmor and fcmb stations and the low pod for fgie and fcel stations respectively furthermore the observed frequency of blowing snow occurrence at low wind speed stations is higher than that of corresponding high wind speed stations these results suggest that the constant threshold wind speed scheme can neither accurately portray the change in frequency of actual blowing snow occurrences as a function of wind speed nor capture the spatial variation in frequency the first issue arises because this method treats the occurrence of blowing snow as a 0 1 problem without considering the variation in occurrence frequency with respect to wind speed while the second issue is due to the contrasting distribution patterns of wind speed in space wind speed is not the only factor that influences the blowing snow occurrences but this method neglects the effects of other factors for example vegetation and topographic essery and pomeroy 2004 the type of snow resulting from air temperature and precipitation changes blowing snow leading to snow compaction van kampenhout et al 2017 which may also influence the subsequent occurrence frequency of blowing snow because of persistent strong winds an example of this is the difference in cred variations between the fmor station fig 2a and other high wind speed stations the pod at high wind speed stations was generally higher than that at low wind speed stations when the temperature based threshold formula was used as the estimation of threshold wind speed was based only on air temperature this method might theoretically identify more blowing snow occurrence at high wind speed stations than at low wind speed stations throughout the temperature range resulting in an excessive number of false alarms this indicates that the temperature based threshold formula should account for the spatial difference in wind speed and thus requiring the optimization of key parameters using historical in situ observations however the spatial extrapolation and application of this method will be further limited the temperature based technique is a more rational approach to identify the occurrence of blowing snow from the perspective of physical conditions than the constant threshold wind speed scheme however the performances of both schemes were similar across stations and both are incapable of handling spatial differences in blowing snow occurrence resulting from spatial differences in wind speed characteristics high wind speed stations may not always correspond to a high frequency of blowing snow occurrence because of the effect of blowing snow on snow compaction van kampenhout et al 2017 therefore historical information on wind speed and blowing snow occurrence should be considered the probability model estimates the probability distribution of blowing snow occurrence from a statistical perspective but with physical basis the model characterizes the potential probability of blowing snow occurrence as a function of wind speed air temperature and snow age this scheme is better suited to probabilistic rather than deterministic prediction because there is a minimum amount of uncertainty that we must tolerate when converting the probability estimation into blowing snow occurrence although the model agrees well with observations in the region where the model was calibrated li and pomeroy 1997b it has major problems when applied to other regions the most important issue is the shape of the normal distribution which is determined by two key parameters the mean and variance of wind speed on the one hand both of these parameters are determined by either fitting the estimated occurrence frequency to observations or by using a constant value therefore they are unable to capture the strong spatial heterogeneity of wind speed characteristics and blowing snow occurrence one thing to note here is that the constant t based and pro scheme are proposed based on the relative frequency of observed transport threshold wind speed they may agree well on an average basis but they are unable to accurately estimate the threshold wind speed at hourly scale as the threshold wind speed varies considerable even with the same ambient circumstances local scale meteorological environmental conditions have a significant impact on the occurrence of blowing snow contributing to the great spatial variability of blowing snow occurrence fig 7 the determination of mean wind speed on the other hand is related to air temperature and snow age in practice however determining the snow age based on routine meteorological observations is a major source of uncertainty as even minor changes of air temperature above or below freeze point and the type of precipitation rainfall or snowfall can result in considerable changes in snow age furthermore gusty conditions favor the occurrence of blowing snow as opposed persistent strong wind conditions which may result in obvious wind hardening and thus restrain the occurrence of blowing snow according to helgason and pomeroy 2012a helgason and pomeroy 2012b alpine environments experience far more gustiness than the canadian prairies where the probability algorithm was devised since it is not feasible to transfer blowing snow algorithms to different geographical regions recalibration using local field observations is therefore essential as the shape parameters of the normal distribution exhibit significant spatial variation moreover by including a gust factor and some statistic regarding wind hardening of the surface we can better illustrate the impact of gustiness on threshold condition for blowing snow occurrences this method is less reliable and effective than the constant threshold wind speed scheme and temperature based threshold wind speed scheme in areas lacking historical blowing snow observations the he scheme detected a low occurrence of blowing snow particularly at low wind speed stations the overall accuracy of this scheme was barely satisfactory with only slightly higher pod and hss than the probability algorithm the biggest issue with this method at present is the overestimation of the threshold wind speed in practical applications characterizing the snow particle size distribution is a challenge the restrictions in the distribution of snow particle size with height according to he and ohara 2017 prohibit the scheme from being widely accepted in practical applications besides as two empirical parameters in the sintering process are used in the proposed formula and scheme is also sensitive to several other parameters e g snow particle radius and drag coefficient these factors might contribute a significant uncertainty to the estimation of threshold wind speed for snow movement however the overall performance of the model is insensitive to the snow particle size as demonstrated in fig 9 it is necessary to calibrate the key parameters using a different objective function as well as to investigate the impacts of the key parameters on the model s accuracy in detecting blowing snow the decision tree based models outperformed other traditional schemes regardless of the strategy employed to train them however we note that the utility of the decision tree model was greatly impaired by its forecasting of too many false alarms as well as the spatial extrapolation capabilities of the model trained with different strategies for example when the dtm specific model was applied to stations other than the training station its accuracy suffered a sharp decline xie et al 2021 furthermore when it came to detecting the blowing snow occurrence for low wind speed stations the decision tree model constructed based on observations only from high wind speed stations dtm homo was less successful than the models constructed based on observations from both low and high wind speed stations dtm inhomo and dtm all as decision tree model is a data driven algorithm built on the maximization if inclusivity its performance relies heavily on the training dataset e g representativeness heterogeneity and class imbalance because of its limited potential for handling heterogeneous data and transfer learning spatial temporal extrapolation choosing an effective training dataset with sufficient information is a prerequisite to guarantee the accuracy of the model moreover black box models combined with machine learning algorithms differ from those interpretable physically based models their lack of interpretability is posing a problem and it needs sufficient attention but fortunately efforts have been made to make machine learning model interpretable and explainable 6 summary the performances of five different parameterizations with varying degrees of complexity in estimating the occurrence of blowing snow across the central french alps were evaluated in this study performances were quantified using four evaluation metrics i e pod oa far and hss at varied wind speed and temperature intervals in an attempt to reveal the current status of the various blowing snow occurrence detection schemes the major conclusion can be summarized as follows traditional approaches recognized far less snow transport than that in the observations with less than half of blowing snow events accurately detected at most stations the comparatively sophisticated methods i e he scheme and pro were less capable of detecting blowing snow occurrences than the basic methods i e constant and t based which might be attributed to inappropriate parameter values there was a noticeable difference between the high and low wind speed stations more specifically the proportion of accurately identified blowing snow occurrences was higher at the high wind speed stations whereas more snow transport was falsely detected traditional models assessed in this study were unable to account for the spatial difference in blowing snow occurrence the ability of the decision tree based models to accurately detect the occurrence of blowing snow is generally high and the difference in performance at high wind speed stations and low wind speed stations was not as significant as that for traditional methods this difference can also be reduced by including information on the occurrence of blowing snow at low wind speed stations however regardless of the strategy employed by the decision tree model this model estimated far too many false alarms both the constant scheme and the t based scheme are simple and effective methods for identifying snow movement although their overall accuracy are far from satisfactory while comparatively sophisticated methods i e he scheme and pro have a solid physical basis their ability to accurately identify blowing snow events remains limit the data driven based decision tree model provides advantages in detecting snow transport but with a high false alarm rate each parameterization assessed in the study has advantages and disadvantages the spatial variability of wind speed can result in considerable spatial variability in the occurrence of blowing snow which cannot be captured by traditional methods parameterization adjustment parameter calibration and optimization are therefore necessary and considering the impact of gustness on threshold condition might facilitate the estimation of blowing snow occurrences data availability statement observation data from the isaw stations can be accessed at https www iav ch credit
