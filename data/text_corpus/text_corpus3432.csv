17160,bioassays are increasingly being implemented for water quality monitoring as targeted chemical analyses are not always sufficient for the detection of all emerging chemicals or transformation products however the interpretation of bioassay results remains challenging in particular because a positive response does not necessarily indicate that there may be an increased risk for this purpose effect based trigger ebt values have been introduced as thresholds above which action needs to be undertaken to determine the cause of the response the goals of this study were to i evaluate various approaches used to determine ebt values and ii based on the findings derive human health ebt values for chemical activated luciferase gene expression calux in vitro bioassays used for routine monitoring of water quality in the netherlands finally iii an uncertainty analysis was carried out to determine the protective power of the derived ebt values and the chance that potentially harmful substances might not be detected ebt values that can be implemented in routine monitoring could be determined for four of eight selected bioassays these ebt were compared to bioassay results from routine water quality monitoring carried out in the netherlands furthermore a framework for the calculation and evaluation of derived ebt values for routine application to monitor drinking water and its sources is proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords effect based trigger values calux bioassay drinking water monitoring uncertainty 1 introduction it is widely acknowledged that with targeted chemical monitoring unknown chemicals such as new emerging chemicals or transformation products may go unnoticed altenburger et al 2015 brand et al 2013 van der oost et al 2017b bioassays can be used as bioanalytical tools to detect such unknown mixtures of chemicals as they give an integrated response to all known and unknown chemicals that induce a response escher and leusch 2011 an increased bioassay response while acceptable concentrations of target chemicals are measured with chemical analysis may indicate that other bioactive chemicals causing this effect are present despite the clear added value of using bioassays in water quality screening the interpretation of bioassay results remains a challenge bioassays can be very sensitive i e already give a positive response at low concentrations therefore a positive bioassay response does not necessarily mean an increased risk for several bioassays used in water quality monitoring response levels that provide a trigger to further assess potential adverse effects for humans or the environment are proposed in the scientific literature for reporter gene assays such thresholds also known as effect based trigger ebt values escher et al 2015 are expressed in equivalents of a reference chemical in the bioassay at responses below the ebt value adverse effects for humans or the environment are not expected while possible adverse effects cannot be excluded at higher responses so a further in depth assessment is needed in the practice of water quality management ebt values need to be sufficiently conservative to be useful as indicators of hazardous bioactive micropollutants in water but also not overly conservative preventing that assets are spent on unnecessary follow up actions brand et al 2013 ebt values of in vitro bioassays are based on the biological equivalent beq concept escher et al 2015 van den berg et al 2006 this concept assumes that if chemicals in a mixture that elicits a response in a specific bioassay share the same mode of action their combined effects can be described by the concentration addition concept a beq concentration of an unknown mixture of chemicals can be measured in a bioassay expressed as reference compound equivalents by comparing the response in the bioassay to the concentration response curve of the reference chemical in that same bioassay endpoint and bioassay specific ebt values for responses of water samples are commonly established based on relative effect potencies rep compared to a reference compound of a range of compounds known or expected to have the same mode of action as captured in the bioassay in the scientific literature different approaches have been proposed to derive effect based trigger ebt values for different purposes escher et al 2013 2015 2018 tang et al 2013 van der oost et al 2017b brand et al 2013 ebt values for the protection of ecosystems can be based upon a species sensitivity distribution of beq that cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms van der oost et al 2017a 2017b in other studies human health based ebt values have been derived based on safe intake levels for humans based on toxicity data brand et al 2013 in other studies ebt values are based on environmental or drinking water guideline values escher et al 2018 2015 2013 tang et al 2013 in the present study we aim to derive ebt values to detect potential risks to drinking water safety for eight different chemical activated luciferase gene expression calux in vitro bioassays that are currently being used in the netherlands as bioanalytical tools for water quality assessment van der oost et al 2017b table 1 bioassays selected for this purpose are a series of nuclear receptor activation and stress response bioassays to derive ebt an approach similar to the one suggested by escher et al 2015 was used the latter considers provisional health based guidance values in drinking water pglv as a point of departure for ebt derivation by evaluating the effect concentration ec50 or lowest observed effect concentrations loec in the bioassay of selected chemicals we first 1 carried out a sensitivity analysis of the impact of different selection criteria i e used to select relevant compounds for ebt derivation and calculation approaches i e used to mathematically derive the ebt on calculated ebt values using the most appropriate combination of selection criteria and derivation approach 2 we calculated ebt values to detect potential risks to drinking water safety for bioassays listed in table 1 finally 3 we introduced a method to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the derived ebt values given that only for a fraction of compounds that can reasonably be expected to trigger a response in the assay based on known effects in analogue in vitro tests rep values are available to derive ebt values 2 materials and methods 2 1 calculation of pglv beq in vitro potencies of individual chemicals in the bioassays were collected from literature allowing the determination of rep values see supporting information these were based on concentrations eliciting a response equal to 50 of the maximum response of the reference compounds ec50 for stress response assays i e nrf2 and p53 calux no ec50 are available and lowest observed effect concentrations loecs were used reference compounds used are reported in table 1 the rep for each compound i was calculated as 1 r e p i e c 50 r e f e c 50 i in the second step safe chemical concentrations in drinking water represented by provisional health based guidance values in drinking water pglv were calculated based on reported safe intake levels see supporting information preferably safe intake levels as derived by competent authorities were used but if these were not available data from sub chronic animal toxicity studies were used to derive safe intake levels baken et al 2018 in that case safe intake levels adi or tdi were obtained by dividing no observed adverse effect levels noaels by 100 to account for intra and interspecies differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics baars et al 2001 if only data from subacute studies were available an extra uncertainty factor of 3 was applied for pharmaceuticals safe intake levels were derived by dividing therapeutic doses defined daily dosis ddd by an uncertainty factor of 100 houtman et al 2014 schriks et al 2010 from these safe intake levels pglv are calculated assuming a bodyweight of 70 kg an allocation factor to water of 20 and a drinking water consumption of 2 l day equation 2 baken et al 2018 2 p g l v μ g l adi μ g k g b w d a y 70 kg 20 2 l d a y in this equation pglv is the provisional guideline value adi is the acceptable daily intake or tolerable daily intake for unavoidable chemicals for genotoxic chemicals it is assumed that no safety thresholds exist and that each exposure increases the risk of adverse health effects therefore an acceptable intake level is calculated which is the dose that is associated with an increase of an extra cancer incidence of 1 in a million individuals upon a lifetime exposure fewtrell and bartram 2001 this intake level associated with an acceptable risk can be determined using data on dose dependent cancer formation in laboratory animals in the present study ltd10 values reported in the carcinogenic potency database cpdb 2019 were used which are the lower confidences of td10 values daily doses that cause an increase in cancer incidences of 10 in laboratory animals using linear extrapolation doses that cause a 1 in a million cancer incidences 0 0001 were calculated which were used to derive pglv for genotoxic carcinogens assuming a bodyweight of 70 kg and a drinking water consumption of 2 l day equation 3 van der aa et al 2017 3 p g l v μ g l dose with acceptable risk μ g k g b w d a y 70 kg 2 l d a y in a third step by multiplying the obtained pglv by their rep values pglv expressed in reference compound equivalents µg l were obtained pglv beq 4 p g l v b e q p g l v r e p 2 2 calculation of ebt values prior to calculation of ebt values six criteria were considered to select the compounds from which ebt values were derived see supporting information for a thorough discussion of the latter these criteria were defined because not all the compounds for which calux specific data are available are relevant to establish ebt values that can be used in routine water monitoring these criteria take into account whether the bioassay contributes to the detection of a substance criterium 2 whether bioactivity can be reasonably expected at concentrations found in drinking water sources criterium 3 whether internal blood concentration are expected to increase by oral intake criterium 4 and discrepancies between potencies in vitro and in humans criterium 5 and 6 alternatively no pre selection was made and all available data was included criterium 1 furthermore five mathematical approaches a to e to derive ebt values were evaluated see supporting information for a thorough discussion of the latter a 5th percentile of normal distribution of pglv beqs b 5th percentile of pglv beqs c linear regression of pglv beqs d quantile regression of pglv beqs e smallest pglv beq these were applied for each of the six selection criteria supplemental figure s1 the criteria and mathematical approaches tested in this study and the findings are described in detail in the supporting information based on the results the ebt presented here are computed by taking the 5th percentile of the log normal cumulative distribution function of the available pglv values approach a of substances where pglvi ec50i or loeci 0 1 selection criterion 6 2 3 simulations and uncertainty analysis due to the limited number of pglv beq values available for calux bioassays an algorithm based on monte carlo simulations was developed to obtain a profile of the variability in derived ebt values and their protective power as a function of the number of compounds available in other terms the goal of these simulations is to estimate the probability that ebt values derived from a limited number of chemicals will be protective i e sufficiently low to detect the presence of potentially harmful mixtures of chemical s also when considering a larger range of chemicals the procedure used is detailed below 2 3 1 step 1 obtaining ec50 values for compounds in analogous bioassays ec50 values for all chemicals 9000 and biological endpoints 1000 listed in the u s epa s toxcast united states environmental protection agency 2016 were downloaded from the toxcast data repository united states environmental protection agency 2018 subsequently only ec50 values measured in bioassays considered as analogues of the calux bioassays were used i e same biological endpoint see supplemental table s1 including the ec50 of the reference compound inactive compounds i e listed in the toxcast data repository as having an ec50 of 106 µm were removed the output of this selection consisted in a large matrix of ec50 values that have been measured in bioassays analogues to calux bioassays it should be noted that analogue bioassays and ec50 values of tested compounds in the toxcast data repository were retrieved only for erα ar anti ar gr nrf2 pah and p53 calux bioassays 2 3 2 step 2 obtaining pglv for compounds in analogue bioassays pglvs of a broad range of water relevant chemicals not limited to compounds that have been tested with calux bioassays were collected from the literature baken et al 2018 the obtained dataset was collated to the available data collected for active chemicals in calux bioassays yielding a dataset of more than 160 pglv for water relevant compounds 2 3 3 step 3 rep and pglv beq calculation rep were then calculated equation 1 from the ec50 values reported in toxcast for calux analogue assays and then used to calculate pglv beq equation 4 2 3 4 step 4 merge and select compounds within the same group of analogue assays e g all compounds tested in assays analogues to erα calux were merged into a single list yielding a dataset of compounds with pglv beq for each of the calux assays for which analogue assays were available compounds from the actual calux assay were also included in this list subsequently the selection criterion defined above was applied i e only compounds with a pglv ec50 ratio above 0 1 were retained the number of compounds available in each dataset before and after applying the selection criterion are shown in table s2 2 3 5 simulations per dataset of calux analogue bioassays it was verified that the obtained pglv beq values could be approximated using a log normal distribution subsequently i for each dataset a certain number of pglv beq were drawn randomly depending on the number of compounds in the corresponding calux assay see table 2 which fulfill the selection criterion for instance if for erα calux 10 compounds are relevant to derive an ebt value after applying the selection criterion i e pglv ec50 0 1 then 10 compounds are randomly drawn from the compounds in the dataset of erα calux analogue assays see step 4 ii the selected pglv beq are then log transformed and the corresponding mean and variance are computed iii a normal distribution and its 5th percentile used as a theoretical ebt value are then computed iv the probability of obtaining a value above the theoretical ebt value for any of the compounds from the analogues dataset is then computed using the derived 5th percentile and the log transformed cumulative distribution function of all n compounds in the dataset this yields the proportion of compounds in the analogous bioassays which have a pglv beq greater or equal to the derived theoretical ebt value and are covered in terms of risk with this ebt v points i to iv are repeated iteratively 10000 times and the outcomes are plotted as histograms and fitted to a beta distribution with shape parameters α and β the 95 confidence intervals were computed from the beta distribution all calculations and simulations were carried out using rstudio rstudio team 2016 2 4 empirical data from water quality monitoring in the netherlands water quality monitoring data was collected by the water laboratory hwl in haarlem the netherlands where a number of in vitro calux bioassays are implemented and presently used for water quality monitoring of sources of and produced drinking water of three drinking water production plants in the netherlands ebt values derived in the context of this study were compared with responses found in real water samples in particular responses found for erα gr and anti ar calux in the period 2013 2017 were used for comparison surface water grab samples and corresponding drinking water samples d1 d4 were collected at four abstraction points used by dutch drinking water companies at the rivers meuse enclosed meuse source 1 s1 and rhine lek channel s2 a reclaimed land area bethune polder s3 lake ijssel s4 details about the collected surface and drinking water samples and extraction protocols are provided in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 pglv rep values of chemicals in bioassays rep values were determined as described in the methods section for each of the bioassays fig 1 shows the relationships between rep log pglv and log pglv beq values for individual substances for chemicals tested in the bioassays pglv values were collected or calculated based on reported safe intake levels or from safe intake levels determined in the present study as described in materials and methods the pglv values were multiplied with their rep values to obtain pglv beq expressed in reference chemical equivalents the data underlying the derivation of the pglv and pglv beq values are presented in the supplementary information most data points substances were available for the anti ar calux assay followed by erα calux ar calux and p53 calux assays for the pr calux and pah calux assays only a few data points substances are available the figure also shows that for each bioassay the majority of the rep values are lower than 1 i e log10 rep 0 especially for erα calux this means that generally the reference compound has a high potency in the bioassay relative to other compounds however this is not necessarily the case for the toxicity of these chemicals in humans as the pglv of the reference compound is not the lowest in all assays the colour per substance indicates the value of the pglv beq with low values shown in blue and high values shown in red to minimize the risk of not detecting potentially harmful chemicals the ebt value needs to be sufficiently low to detect all these substances on the other hand an ebt value should not be too low to avoid unnecessary follow up analyses to prevent this some of the substances were excluded from the derivation of the ebt if they did not fulfil the selection criterion as explained previously these compounds are indicated in fig 1 by a black circle these are also reported as cumulative distributions in figure s2 a line is included in the plots to represent a level of 100 times the signalling value of 0 1 µg l to identify which substances may pose a risk at water concentrations not detected using conventional chemical analyses if below this line 3 2 derivation of ebt values from pglv beq ebt values were derived from pglv beq based on the full dataset or a selection based on criterion 6 namely 0 1 pglvi ec50i or loeci and using estimation method a namely the 5th percentile of the normal distribution of pglv beqs results are reported in table 2 0 1 pglvi ec50i or loeci was selected as a criterion because it excludes compounds which are potent in humans low pglv but not in the bioassay higher ec50 this could be the case because the substance also triggers another and more sensitive mode of action in humans to which the pglv is related different from the one captured by the bioassay in question the original criterion developed by escher et al 2015 also included an upper boundary of 10 which is used to exclude compounds with low ec50 hence responsive in the bioassay yet not relevant for humans high pglvs this is not an issue per se as in humans the uptake of such compounds may be limited and or they may be rapidly metabolized resulting in low internal concentrations in such cases the low toxicity in vivo is thus not due to the low intrinsic potency of the chemical but to the ability of the human body to mitigate internal concentrations although such compounds would in most cases have high pglv beq values and would hence skew the distribution of pglv beqs used to derive ebt values they remain relevant for this reason in this work it was decided not to include the upper boundary and to keep such potentially relevant compounds for the determination of ebt values 3 2 1 erα calux after selection using the previously described criterion 16 out 20 compounds remained see fig 1 to derive the ebt value which amounts to 0 05 ng e2 eq l this value is lower compared to other ebt values reported in the literature for instance escher et al 2018 reported an ebt value of 0 1 ng e2 eq l van der oost et al 2017b obtained an ebt of 0 5 ng e2 eq l for this bioassay but it should be mentioned that the authors selected compounds having a rep 0 001 and focused on ecological risks rather than effects on humans on the other hand brand et al 2013 derived a higher value namely 3 8 ng e2 eq l the difference between the ebt values obtained in the present study and those reported in the literature is likely due to the inclusion of one compound i e prothioconazole at the lower end of the distribution as shown in figure s2 which has a low pglv beq value although it did fulfill the selection criterion it was decided to remove this low potency compound from the selection without prothioconazole compound the obtained ebt value amounts to 0 25 ng e2 eq l which is in the same range as those from the literature 3 2 2 anti ar calux out of the 31 compounds available for anti ar calux 21 remained after applying the selection criterion see fig 1 and the obtained ebt value was equal to 4 8 µg flut eq l this is in line with the ebt values suggested by escher et al 2018 and van der oost et al 2017b of 14 4 and 25 µg flut eq l for this bioassay respectively although both these ebt values are higher as compared to the figure obtained here to allow practical use of the ebt both authors used a correction of the lower values they obtained with their regular approach escher et al 2018 used a mixture factor of 100x to account for the potential presence of unknown substances in surface waters that may have a response in this bioassay ebt in this study focus on ecological risks but are often considered to be protective also for human health effects based on the assumption that environmental quality standards eqs are often lower than pglvs if this assumption holds true also for mixture effects requires further study van der oost et al 2017 focussed on ecological risks and used the background beq consisting of the average beq measured at sites with a good ecological situation multiplied by a factor ranging from 2 to 5 3 2 3 ar calux in the specific case of the ar calux after selection of relevant compounds 16 out of the 18 initial chemicals see fig 1 were still retained to derive an ebt value which amounts to 4 5 ng dht eq l this value is in the same order of magnitude as the ebt value of 11 ng dht eq l derived by brand et al 2013 escher et al 2015 derived an ebt value of 14 ng testosterone equivalents l for the ar calux assay which corresponds to 3 4 ng dht eq l quite similar to the one derived in the present study 3 2 4 pr calux for pr calux only 4 of the 6 compounds initially available were left after excluding chemicals based on the defined criterion furthermore large differences in pglv beq values were found between compounds as shown in fig 1 based on remaining compounds an ebt value of 15 5 ng p4 eq l was calculated on the other hand using the entire dataset an ebt value of 0 223 ng p4 eq l would have been obtained which is much lower than ebt values reported in the literature brand et al 2013 calculated an ebt value which was substantially higher namely 333 ng org2058 eq l which corresponds to 4 5 µg p4 eq l as discussed previously this might be due to the different approach used to derive ebts nevertheless due to the limited number of chemicals available and the lack of other data from the literature the ebt derived here should be only considered as a preliminary indication 3 2 5 gr calux after selection of relevant compounds a total of 6 out of 8 chemicals initially available was used to derive an ebt value of 47 9 ng dex eq l due to the limited number of available compounds the ebt value obtained here should be considered only as a preliminary indication when compared to results from the literature the obtained ebt is in the same order of magnitude as the ebt value of 21 ng dex eq l derived by brand et al 2013 although focused on water quality from an ecotoxicology perspective van der oost et al 2017b reported a slightly higher ebt of 100 ng dex eq l whilst the ebt value derived here does not deviate substantially from results reported in the literature analysis of a broader range of compounds is advisable to corroborate the reliability of the obtained result 3 2 6 pah calux only 3 chemicals out of the 6 initially fulfilled the selection criterion the ebt value was estimated to 24 4 ng bap eq l which lies within the range of ebt values reported in the literature for surface water namely 6 2 ng bap eq l escher et al 2018 and 150 ng bap eq l van der oost et al 2017b inclusion of all available chemicals did not substantially modify the derived ebt value 19 3 ng bap eq l as for pr and gr calux the obtained ebt value should only be viewed as a preliminary threshold due to the limited number of compounds available to derive it additional chemicals should be measured to obtain a larger dataset to derive a reliable ebt for routine monitoring of drinking water quality 3 2 7 nrf2 calux in the specific case of the nrf2 calux only two out of 8 compounds fulfilled the requirements of the selection criterion and an ebt of 16 mg cur eq l was derived whilst when using all available chemicals an ebt value of 1 7 ng cur eq l was obtained the large difference is due to the broad range of pglv beq values as shown in fig 1 van der oost et al 2017b derived a trigger value for the nrf2 calux equal to 10 µg cur eq l whereas the trigger value derived by escher et al 2018 derived for this bioassay amounts to 26 µg dichlorvos eq l which corresponds to 42 µg cur eq l as discussed previously van der oost et al 2017b focused on ecological risks and used background beqs to derive an ebt for oxidative stress due to the effects which are readily measured at sites with good ecological status compared to results from actual measurements the obtained ebt value is substantially higher compared to median responses obtained in the netherlands for raw water used for drinking water production namely 2 8 µg cur eq l personal communication the water laboratorium haarlem the netherlands the limited amount of data available hinders the derivation of reliable ebt values for the nrf2 calux and highlights the need to measure a broader range of compounds before a robust threshold can be derived for routine applications as many chemicals activate oxidative stress bioassays their use to detect specific chemicals or to track removal of chemicals more generally needs further study 3 2 8 p53 calux out of the 18 compounds initially available for this bioassay only 4 fulfilled the selection criterion and an ebt value of 54 µg 2 aaf eq l was estimated whilst an ebt value of 8 pg 2 aaf eq l was obtained using the full dataset this substantial difference is due to the fact that most of the excluded chemicals actually lie in the lower part of the distribution as shown in fig 1 these chemicals were excluded due to their low activity in this particular bioassay further it must be noted that besides genotoxic chemicals also a large set of non genotoxic chemicals are active in this bioassay current guidelines for genotoxic substances that may be potentially carcinogenic assume that there is no safe level chances of adverse effects decrease at lower exposure levels but a theoretical contribution to a health risk always remains since low risk levels of most genotoxic chemicals are much lower than safe levels of non genotoxic chemicals the distribution of pglv beq spans a too large range to derive useful ebt values for all these chemicals no other studies have derived ebt values for the p53 calux or other related stress response bioassays so far similar to the previous bioassay the limited number of compounds available hinders the derivation of an ebt value additional substances need to be tested in this and other genotoxicity bioassays before a reliable threshold can be derived that can be applied in routine 3 3 simulations in the previous section ebt values were determined for a set of calux bioassays based on available pglv beq in an ideal situation one would derive ebt values from a very large set of pglv beq i e from a very large number of substances that i have been tested in the considered bioassays and ii for which enough toxicity information is available to derive a pglv however this is often not the case and ebt values are derived using data from a limited number of substances this introduces uncertainties because depending on the representativeness of the available pglv beq values i e whether they are a representative sample of the population of compounds which could be encountered in practice derived ebt values might not be adequate to assess the quality of water intended for drinking water production in an attempt to quantify the uncertainty surrounding ebt values estimated using only a limited number of compounds an algorithm was developed which uses data derived from the literature and the toxcast data repository united states environmental protection agency 2018 as highlighted previously the goal of the developed algorithm is not to compute actual ebt values to be used in practice but rather to assess the risk that ebt values derived from a limited number of pglv beq might not be able to effectively detect the presence of a potentially harmful compound and as a consequence be unreliable in other terms the oal of the algorithm is to determine the proportion of relevant chemicals giving a response in the bioassay above the established ebt value simulation results are reported in fig 2 in the case of erα anti ar and ar calux analogues the obtained 95 confidence interval 95 ci suggest that with the available number of chemicals the derived ebts would be able to detect 83 or more of potentially harmful chemicals in the case of gr and pah calux analogues it was not possible to obtain substantially more data from the toxcast data repositor i e only 8 and 9 compounds respectively compared to the number of compounds for which calux specific data were available i e 6 see table 1 consequently it cannot be excluded that the estimated proportion of pglv beq theoretical ebt is overly optimistic and that the true 95 ci is actually broader than what was obtained here for nrf2 and p53 calux analogues more relevant data could be recovered from the toxcast data repository namely 22 and 25 pglv beq versus only 2 and 4 for the calux assays respectively in both cases after applying the selection criterion when observing the 95 ci these were much broader indicating that the derived ebt values will likely not be sufficiently low to detect potentially harmful chemicals overall these findings illustrate that if the number of substances relevant for the bioassays available in toxcast is sufficiently large compared to the total number of potential unknown compounds which might be encountered in practice ebt values that are expected to be protective can be derived this was the case for erα anti ar and ar calux analogues it should however be emphasized that the difference between the size of the total population is only roughly twice the size of the number of values drawn e g 16 compounds drawn versus a total population of 39 for erα calux analogues this population can be expected to be only a small proportion of all substances having a comparable activity that may be encountered during water monitoring consequently it is possible that the obtained 95 ci are overoptimistic as the same compounds are more likely to be drawn from smaller populations on the other hand if the number of relevant substances available increases the more likely it is that the derived ebt value will be protective in particular if it is derived as the 5th percentile of the associated log normal distribution these results however also highlight the difficulty of deriving reliable ebt values when only few pglv beq values are available and or their distribution deviates from log normality as is the case for nrf2 p53 and pah calux this can be seen in the obtained 95 ci which are substantially broader compared to the previous 4 assays defining a threshold below which the number of available compounds is deemed too low to derive a reliable ebt value is also difficult as it depends on the variability of responses given by chemicals in a specific assay i e distribution of rep for instance by using 10 or 5 compounds instead of 16 for the erα calux analogue assays the 95 ci interval would broaden to 76 100 or 61 100 respectively to have a 95 chance of covering at least 80 of all chemicals one would need at least 12 compounds likewise for assays analogue to nrf2 calux going from 2 to 8 available compounds to derive an ebt value improves the 95 ci to 82 99 see fig 3 thus in situations where ebt values are derived using a low number of relevant compounds i e less then 8 10 according to the examples shown above which do not cover a representative range of rep it would be advisable to introduce a precautionary factor however the most appropriate approach to overcome this situation is to collect more experimental data for water relevant substances for instance by determining rep for a broader range of compounds for the assay in question or to derive pglv for a larger set of compounds in fact chemicals have often been tested with bioassays i e ec50 have been calculated and rep can hence be derived however there is a lack of information about guideline values for drinking water i e pglv have not been determined enlarging the dataset provides the empirical basis necessary to derive reliable ebt values which can be implemented in regular drinking water quality monitoring 3 4 overview with regard to methods used to derive ebt values results show that these have only a secondary influence on the outcomes nevertheless based on the assumption that pglv beq values follow a normal distribution we suggested to use the 5th percentile of a normal distribution as derivation method the most influential factor in determining the ebt value is the selection criterion used for data inclusion exclusion in this study we bring forward various arguments to support the use of the criterion suggested by escher et al 2015 yet without including the upper boundary this because we consider that highly responsive compounds i e whose pglv beq ec50 10 are relevant and there is no obvious reason why these should be excluded on the other hand non responsive compounds should be excluded because they are likely not relevant for the endpoint considered by the specific bioassay using the abovementioned approach ebt values were derived for calux assays based on the size of the available datasets for each bioassay and the outcome of the simulations ebt values which can be implemented in practice could be obtained for erα anti ar ar and gr calux this was not the case for pr pah nrf2 and p53 calux because either the number of compounds available was too small hence the uncertainty obtained from the simulations was too large or the differences with ebt values from the literature were too large for these bioassays additional studies in particular the collection of a broader dataset i e measuring more compounds and increasing the number of available pglv beq is needed before reliable ebt values can be obtained for non specific bioassays such as nrf2 calux other implementations e g to monitor the removal of bioactive chemicals rather than to detect the presence of potentially risks are also envisaged finally it should be stressed that no unique algorithm is able to derive solid trigger values for all bioassays since unrealistically low ebt values can always be obtained for certain bioassays incorporation of precautionary correction factors based on actual measurements in the water cycle can be considered to increase ebts if these are unrealistically low for instance in other studies assessment factors tang et al 2013 background responses van der oost et al 2017a or mixture toxicity factors escher et al 2018 were used to adjust derived ebt values 3 5 implications of the derived ebt values for drinking water useful ebt values should indicate potential chemical risks yet at the same time they should avoid giving too many false positives the ebt values obtained in this study were compared to empirical data from routine monitoring of drinking water sources in the netherlands to estimate their applicability in practice see supporting information for more details fig 4 shows the boxplots with the measured bioassay activities in the drinking water sources s1 s4 and the corresponding drinking waters d1 d4 for estrogenic activity as measured with erα calux the ebt value is 7 times higher compared to the limit of quantification loq of 0 034 ng e2 eq l in the untreated sources estrogenic activity was regularly detected with median concentrations in the range of 0 051 0 35 ng e2 eq l period 2013 2017 table s1 s3 has a relative high exceedance rate of the ebt value which is notable since it has the lowest anthropogenic influence of the included drinking water sources as seen with the routine monitoring of chemicals an effect directed analysis research has been carried out that tentatively identified e2 as the responsible compound causing this activity in preparation data not shown e2 possibly enters s3 via manure from animal farming in d3 there is no exceedance of the ebt value indicating that e2 is removed during the different drinking water treatment processes also in the other drinking water treatments the compounds causing the estrogenic activity are mostly removed the ebt is exceeded only in drinking water d1 and only in 3 percent of measurements glucorticoid activity as measured with the gr calux is not often detected in untreated drinking water sources and never in drinking water in the period 2013 2017 the ebt value which is one order of magnitude higher than the loq is only exceeded in s1 and s4 in one of the samples fig 4 table s2 anti androgenic activity as measured with the anti ar calux has been analysed since 2016 and is regularly detected in untreated drinking water sources anti androgenic activity is measured above the loq in more than 83 of samples from all sources anti androgenic responses do fluctuate over time in the sources and equivalent concentrations up to 35 µg flut eq l are measured fig 4 the anti androgenic activity decreases during the different water treatment processes and also in d2 d3 and d4 the ebt is sporadically exceeded van der oost et al 2017a found that the background concentrations for anti androgenic activity in unpolluted sites were almost 100 000 times higher than the beq that was considered safe based on ecological toxicity data for the most sensitive organism but also 35 times higher than the beq derived as the 5 hazard concentration in a ssd analysis the group of compounds that are known to have anti androgenic potencies is large and heterogeneous and include polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides and pharmaceuticals e g flutamide aït aïssa et al 2010 hamers et al 2011 houtman et al 2020 but also natural organic matter and humic acids that are considered non toxic bittner et al 2012 this makes it more complicated to derive and interpret an ebt value since the ebt value is exceeded regularly it is advisable to obtain better insights into the compounds that could be responsible for the responses especially in drinking water if the compounds can be identified a more specific risk assessment can be performed and consequently the ebt can be adjusted to reflect realistic risks it must be stressed that an exceedance of an ebt value does not necessary mean that there is a risk however it signals the presence of a hazard induced by one or more potentially harmful compounds at the same time the fact that there are substances with low pglv values but relatively high ec50 means that substances that pose a risk might be present yet these do not elicit an effect in the considered calux assay furthermore if the pglv is very small but the ec50 is within a normal range of values found for other active compounds the bioassay will show an effect for the latter yet because such compound will likely not fulfil the selection criterion i e pglv ec50 0 1 it will not be included in the determination of the ebt and hence might not be detected i e the derived ebt will not be low enough to signal its presence this means that the calux assays in combination with the derived ebt values cannot completely exclude risks i e lack of false negatives especially if only a few bioassays are included in the effect based monitoring strategy rather they can signal the presence of an explicit risk this underlines also that an optimal risk based monitoring strategy for the diagnosis of water quality should include both chemical analyses targeted and non targeted and effect base monitoring brunner et al 2020 in cases in which the measured response in drinking water exceeds the ebt value it is also recommended to repeat the bioassay measurement in the specific location to determine whether the exceedance can reasonably be expected to be incidental if the measured response continues to exceed the ebt value it would be advised to initiate an investigation to find out which compounds are responsible effect directed analysis eda an approach that combines biological analysis with chemical analysis is a promising tool for the detection and identification of the responsible biologically active compound s houtman et al 2018 zwart et al 2018 as discussed previously a compromise should be found between the prevention of false negative and false positive results from a water quality and health perspective the first aspect is of relevance but additional research should also focus on the latter to prevent unnecessary analytical costs or even interruption of drinking water production 4 conclusion bioassays have become an important tool in assessing water quality yet the interpretation of results can be challenging as a positive response does not necessarily implicate a risk for humans consequently effect based trigger values ebt that relate response levels to potential human risks are needed following established procedures we attempted to derive ebt values for a set of eight calux bioassays which could be implemented in practice we developed an innovative algorithm which uses available data about bioassays analogues to the calux assays together with monte carlo simulations to derive ebt values and assess their protective power or in other words their ability to detect the presence of many potentially hazardous chemicals at concentrations close to their provisional health based guidance values in drinking water pglv for four of the considered bioassays namely erα anti ar ar and gr calux the available data were deemed sufficient to derive reliable and realistic ebt values which could be used in practice to monitor the quality of drinking water for the remaining four i e pr pah nrf2 and p53 calux the limited amount of data available as well as the important differences between ebt values obtained here and in the literature prevented their reliable implementation in practice besides testing a larger number of chemicals to obtain more ec50 values from which rep can be calculated there is also a lack of pglv values in fact for quite a large number of substances for which activity was detected in one or more bioassays health guideline values for drinking water are lacking some of the derived ebt values could be compared to actual data from drinking water and sources in the netherlands for erα and gr calux the derived ebt did not seem to cause particularly high exceedances and thus appear to be appropriate for use in routine settings for anti ar calux however higher numbers of exceedances were observed and more insights are required to understand which compounds are causing these whilst obtaining a definitive ebt is still a matter of debate this work provides a framework to derive ebt values and assess their protective power using available data declaration of

17160,bioassays are increasingly being implemented for water quality monitoring as targeted chemical analyses are not always sufficient for the detection of all emerging chemicals or transformation products however the interpretation of bioassay results remains challenging in particular because a positive response does not necessarily indicate that there may be an increased risk for this purpose effect based trigger ebt values have been introduced as thresholds above which action needs to be undertaken to determine the cause of the response the goals of this study were to i evaluate various approaches used to determine ebt values and ii based on the findings derive human health ebt values for chemical activated luciferase gene expression calux in vitro bioassays used for routine monitoring of water quality in the netherlands finally iii an uncertainty analysis was carried out to determine the protective power of the derived ebt values and the chance that potentially harmful substances might not be detected ebt values that can be implemented in routine monitoring could be determined for four of eight selected bioassays these ebt were compared to bioassay results from routine water quality monitoring carried out in the netherlands furthermore a framework for the calculation and evaluation of derived ebt values for routine application to monitor drinking water and its sources is proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords effect based trigger values calux bioassay drinking water monitoring uncertainty 1 introduction it is widely acknowledged that with targeted chemical monitoring unknown chemicals such as new emerging chemicals or transformation products may go unnoticed altenburger et al 2015 brand et al 2013 van der oost et al 2017b bioassays can be used as bioanalytical tools to detect such unknown mixtures of chemicals as they give an integrated response to all known and unknown chemicals that induce a response escher and leusch 2011 an increased bioassay response while acceptable concentrations of target chemicals are measured with chemical analysis may indicate that other bioactive chemicals causing this effect are present despite the clear added value of using bioassays in water quality screening the interpretation of bioassay results remains a challenge bioassays can be very sensitive i e already give a positive response at low concentrations therefore a positive bioassay response does not necessarily mean an increased risk for several bioassays used in water quality monitoring response levels that provide a trigger to further assess potential adverse effects for humans or the environment are proposed in the scientific literature for reporter gene assays such thresholds also known as effect based trigger ebt values escher et al 2015 are expressed in equivalents of a reference chemical in the bioassay at responses below the ebt value adverse effects for humans or the environment are not expected while possible adverse effects cannot be excluded at higher responses so a further in depth assessment is needed in the practice of water quality management ebt values need to be sufficiently conservative to be useful as indicators of hazardous bioactive micropollutants in water but also not overly conservative preventing that assets are spent on unnecessary follow up actions brand et al 2013 ebt values of in vitro bioassays are based on the biological equivalent beq concept escher et al 2015 van den berg et al 2006 this concept assumes that if chemicals in a mixture that elicits a response in a specific bioassay share the same mode of action their combined effects can be described by the concentration addition concept a beq concentration of an unknown mixture of chemicals can be measured in a bioassay expressed as reference compound equivalents by comparing the response in the bioassay to the concentration response curve of the reference chemical in that same bioassay endpoint and bioassay specific ebt values for responses of water samples are commonly established based on relative effect potencies rep compared to a reference compound of a range of compounds known or expected to have the same mode of action as captured in the bioassay in the scientific literature different approaches have been proposed to derive effect based trigger ebt values for different purposes escher et al 2013 2015 2018 tang et al 2013 van der oost et al 2017b brand et al 2013 ebt values for the protection of ecosystems can be based upon a species sensitivity distribution of beq that cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms van der oost et al 2017a 2017b in other studies human health based ebt values have been derived based on safe intake levels for humans based on toxicity data brand et al 2013 in other studies ebt values are based on environmental or drinking water guideline values escher et al 2018 2015 2013 tang et al 2013 in the present study we aim to derive ebt values to detect potential risks to drinking water safety for eight different chemical activated luciferase gene expression calux in vitro bioassays that are currently being used in the netherlands as bioanalytical tools for water quality assessment van der oost et al 2017b table 1 bioassays selected for this purpose are a series of nuclear receptor activation and stress response bioassays to derive ebt an approach similar to the one suggested by escher et al 2015 was used the latter considers provisional health based guidance values in drinking water pglv as a point of departure for ebt derivation by evaluating the effect concentration ec50 or lowest observed effect concentrations loec in the bioassay of selected chemicals we first 1 carried out a sensitivity analysis of the impact of different selection criteria i e used to select relevant compounds for ebt derivation and calculation approaches i e used to mathematically derive the ebt on calculated ebt values using the most appropriate combination of selection criteria and derivation approach 2 we calculated ebt values to detect potential risks to drinking water safety for bioassays listed in table 1 finally 3 we introduced a method to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the derived ebt values given that only for a fraction of compounds that can reasonably be expected to trigger a response in the assay based on known effects in analogue in vitro tests rep values are available to derive ebt values 2 materials and methods 2 1 calculation of pglv beq in vitro potencies of individual chemicals in the bioassays were collected from literature allowing the determination of rep values see supporting information these were based on concentrations eliciting a response equal to 50 of the maximum response of the reference compounds ec50 for stress response assays i e nrf2 and p53 calux no ec50 are available and lowest observed effect concentrations loecs were used reference compounds used are reported in table 1 the rep for each compound i was calculated as 1 r e p i e c 50 r e f e c 50 i in the second step safe chemical concentrations in drinking water represented by provisional health based guidance values in drinking water pglv were calculated based on reported safe intake levels see supporting information preferably safe intake levels as derived by competent authorities were used but if these were not available data from sub chronic animal toxicity studies were used to derive safe intake levels baken et al 2018 in that case safe intake levels adi or tdi were obtained by dividing no observed adverse effect levels noaels by 100 to account for intra and interspecies differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics baars et al 2001 if only data from subacute studies were available an extra uncertainty factor of 3 was applied for pharmaceuticals safe intake levels were derived by dividing therapeutic doses defined daily dosis ddd by an uncertainty factor of 100 houtman et al 2014 schriks et al 2010 from these safe intake levels pglv are calculated assuming a bodyweight of 70 kg an allocation factor to water of 20 and a drinking water consumption of 2 l day equation 2 baken et al 2018 2 p g l v μ g l adi μ g k g b w d a y 70 kg 20 2 l d a y in this equation pglv is the provisional guideline value adi is the acceptable daily intake or tolerable daily intake for unavoidable chemicals for genotoxic chemicals it is assumed that no safety thresholds exist and that each exposure increases the risk of adverse health effects therefore an acceptable intake level is calculated which is the dose that is associated with an increase of an extra cancer incidence of 1 in a million individuals upon a lifetime exposure fewtrell and bartram 2001 this intake level associated with an acceptable risk can be determined using data on dose dependent cancer formation in laboratory animals in the present study ltd10 values reported in the carcinogenic potency database cpdb 2019 were used which are the lower confidences of td10 values daily doses that cause an increase in cancer incidences of 10 in laboratory animals using linear extrapolation doses that cause a 1 in a million cancer incidences 0 0001 were calculated which were used to derive pglv for genotoxic carcinogens assuming a bodyweight of 70 kg and a drinking water consumption of 2 l day equation 3 van der aa et al 2017 3 p g l v μ g l dose with acceptable risk μ g k g b w d a y 70 kg 2 l d a y in a third step by multiplying the obtained pglv by their rep values pglv expressed in reference compound equivalents µg l were obtained pglv beq 4 p g l v b e q p g l v r e p 2 2 calculation of ebt values prior to calculation of ebt values six criteria were considered to select the compounds from which ebt values were derived see supporting information for a thorough discussion of the latter these criteria were defined because not all the compounds for which calux specific data are available are relevant to establish ebt values that can be used in routine water monitoring these criteria take into account whether the bioassay contributes to the detection of a substance criterium 2 whether bioactivity can be reasonably expected at concentrations found in drinking water sources criterium 3 whether internal blood concentration are expected to increase by oral intake criterium 4 and discrepancies between potencies in vitro and in humans criterium 5 and 6 alternatively no pre selection was made and all available data was included criterium 1 furthermore five mathematical approaches a to e to derive ebt values were evaluated see supporting information for a thorough discussion of the latter a 5th percentile of normal distribution of pglv beqs b 5th percentile of pglv beqs c linear regression of pglv beqs d quantile regression of pglv beqs e smallest pglv beq these were applied for each of the six selection criteria supplemental figure s1 the criteria and mathematical approaches tested in this study and the findings are described in detail in the supporting information based on the results the ebt presented here are computed by taking the 5th percentile of the log normal cumulative distribution function of the available pglv values approach a of substances where pglvi ec50i or loeci 0 1 selection criterion 6 2 3 simulations and uncertainty analysis due to the limited number of pglv beq values available for calux bioassays an algorithm based on monte carlo simulations was developed to obtain a profile of the variability in derived ebt values and their protective power as a function of the number of compounds available in other terms the goal of these simulations is to estimate the probability that ebt values derived from a limited number of chemicals will be protective i e sufficiently low to detect the presence of potentially harmful mixtures of chemical s also when considering a larger range of chemicals the procedure used is detailed below 2 3 1 step 1 obtaining ec50 values for compounds in analogous bioassays ec50 values for all chemicals 9000 and biological endpoints 1000 listed in the u s epa s toxcast united states environmental protection agency 2016 were downloaded from the toxcast data repository united states environmental protection agency 2018 subsequently only ec50 values measured in bioassays considered as analogues of the calux bioassays were used i e same biological endpoint see supplemental table s1 including the ec50 of the reference compound inactive compounds i e listed in the toxcast data repository as having an ec50 of 106 µm were removed the output of this selection consisted in a large matrix of ec50 values that have been measured in bioassays analogues to calux bioassays it should be noted that analogue bioassays and ec50 values of tested compounds in the toxcast data repository were retrieved only for erα ar anti ar gr nrf2 pah and p53 calux bioassays 2 3 2 step 2 obtaining pglv for compounds in analogue bioassays pglvs of a broad range of water relevant chemicals not limited to compounds that have been tested with calux bioassays were collected from the literature baken et al 2018 the obtained dataset was collated to the available data collected for active chemicals in calux bioassays yielding a dataset of more than 160 pglv for water relevant compounds 2 3 3 step 3 rep and pglv beq calculation rep were then calculated equation 1 from the ec50 values reported in toxcast for calux analogue assays and then used to calculate pglv beq equation 4 2 3 4 step 4 merge and select compounds within the same group of analogue assays e g all compounds tested in assays analogues to erα calux were merged into a single list yielding a dataset of compounds with pglv beq for each of the calux assays for which analogue assays were available compounds from the actual calux assay were also included in this list subsequently the selection criterion defined above was applied i e only compounds with a pglv ec50 ratio above 0 1 were retained the number of compounds available in each dataset before and after applying the selection criterion are shown in table s2 2 3 5 simulations per dataset of calux analogue bioassays it was verified that the obtained pglv beq values could be approximated using a log normal distribution subsequently i for each dataset a certain number of pglv beq were drawn randomly depending on the number of compounds in the corresponding calux assay see table 2 which fulfill the selection criterion for instance if for erα calux 10 compounds are relevant to derive an ebt value after applying the selection criterion i e pglv ec50 0 1 then 10 compounds are randomly drawn from the compounds in the dataset of erα calux analogue assays see step 4 ii the selected pglv beq are then log transformed and the corresponding mean and variance are computed iii a normal distribution and its 5th percentile used as a theoretical ebt value are then computed iv the probability of obtaining a value above the theoretical ebt value for any of the compounds from the analogues dataset is then computed using the derived 5th percentile and the log transformed cumulative distribution function of all n compounds in the dataset this yields the proportion of compounds in the analogous bioassays which have a pglv beq greater or equal to the derived theoretical ebt value and are covered in terms of risk with this ebt v points i to iv are repeated iteratively 10000 times and the outcomes are plotted as histograms and fitted to a beta distribution with shape parameters α and β the 95 confidence intervals were computed from the beta distribution all calculations and simulations were carried out using rstudio rstudio team 2016 2 4 empirical data from water quality monitoring in the netherlands water quality monitoring data was collected by the water laboratory hwl in haarlem the netherlands where a number of in vitro calux bioassays are implemented and presently used for water quality monitoring of sources of and produced drinking water of three drinking water production plants in the netherlands ebt values derived in the context of this study were compared with responses found in real water samples in particular responses found for erα gr and anti ar calux in the period 2013 2017 were used for comparison surface water grab samples and corresponding drinking water samples d1 d4 were collected at four abstraction points used by dutch drinking water companies at the rivers meuse enclosed meuse source 1 s1 and rhine lek channel s2 a reclaimed land area bethune polder s3 lake ijssel s4 details about the collected surface and drinking water samples and extraction protocols are provided in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 pglv rep values of chemicals in bioassays rep values were determined as described in the methods section for each of the bioassays fig 1 shows the relationships between rep log pglv and log pglv beq values for individual substances for chemicals tested in the bioassays pglv values were collected or calculated based on reported safe intake levels or from safe intake levels determined in the present study as described in materials and methods the pglv values were multiplied with their rep values to obtain pglv beq expressed in reference chemical equivalents the data underlying the derivation of the pglv and pglv beq values are presented in the supplementary information most data points substances were available for the anti ar calux assay followed by erα calux ar calux and p53 calux assays for the pr calux and pah calux assays only a few data points substances are available the figure also shows that for each bioassay the majority of the rep values are lower than 1 i e log10 rep 0 especially for erα calux this means that generally the reference compound has a high potency in the bioassay relative to other compounds however this is not necessarily the case for the toxicity of these chemicals in humans as the pglv of the reference compound is not the lowest in all assays the colour per substance indicates the value of the pglv beq with low values shown in blue and high values shown in red to minimize the risk of not detecting potentially harmful chemicals the ebt value needs to be sufficiently low to detect all these substances on the other hand an ebt value should not be too low to avoid unnecessary follow up analyses to prevent this some of the substances were excluded from the derivation of the ebt if they did not fulfil the selection criterion as explained previously these compounds are indicated in fig 1 by a black circle these are also reported as cumulative distributions in figure s2 a line is included in the plots to represent a level of 100 times the signalling value of 0 1 µg l to identify which substances may pose a risk at water concentrations not detected using conventional chemical analyses if below this line 3 2 derivation of ebt values from pglv beq ebt values were derived from pglv beq based on the full dataset or a selection based on criterion 6 namely 0 1 pglvi ec50i or loeci and using estimation method a namely the 5th percentile of the normal distribution of pglv beqs results are reported in table 2 0 1 pglvi ec50i or loeci was selected as a criterion because it excludes compounds which are potent in humans low pglv but not in the bioassay higher ec50 this could be the case because the substance also triggers another and more sensitive mode of action in humans to which the pglv is related different from the one captured by the bioassay in question the original criterion developed by escher et al 2015 also included an upper boundary of 10 which is used to exclude compounds with low ec50 hence responsive in the bioassay yet not relevant for humans high pglvs this is not an issue per se as in humans the uptake of such compounds may be limited and or they may be rapidly metabolized resulting in low internal concentrations in such cases the low toxicity in vivo is thus not due to the low intrinsic potency of the chemical but to the ability of the human body to mitigate internal concentrations although such compounds would in most cases have high pglv beq values and would hence skew the distribution of pglv beqs used to derive ebt values they remain relevant for this reason in this work it was decided not to include the upper boundary and to keep such potentially relevant compounds for the determination of ebt values 3 2 1 erα calux after selection using the previously described criterion 16 out 20 compounds remained see fig 1 to derive the ebt value which amounts to 0 05 ng e2 eq l this value is lower compared to other ebt values reported in the literature for instance escher et al 2018 reported an ebt value of 0 1 ng e2 eq l van der oost et al 2017b obtained an ebt of 0 5 ng e2 eq l for this bioassay but it should be mentioned that the authors selected compounds having a rep 0 001 and focused on ecological risks rather than effects on humans on the other hand brand et al 2013 derived a higher value namely 3 8 ng e2 eq l the difference between the ebt values obtained in the present study and those reported in the literature is likely due to the inclusion of one compound i e prothioconazole at the lower end of the distribution as shown in figure s2 which has a low pglv beq value although it did fulfill the selection criterion it was decided to remove this low potency compound from the selection without prothioconazole compound the obtained ebt value amounts to 0 25 ng e2 eq l which is in the same range as those from the literature 3 2 2 anti ar calux out of the 31 compounds available for anti ar calux 21 remained after applying the selection criterion see fig 1 and the obtained ebt value was equal to 4 8 µg flut eq l this is in line with the ebt values suggested by escher et al 2018 and van der oost et al 2017b of 14 4 and 25 µg flut eq l for this bioassay respectively although both these ebt values are higher as compared to the figure obtained here to allow practical use of the ebt both authors used a correction of the lower values they obtained with their regular approach escher et al 2018 used a mixture factor of 100x to account for the potential presence of unknown substances in surface waters that may have a response in this bioassay ebt in this study focus on ecological risks but are often considered to be protective also for human health effects based on the assumption that environmental quality standards eqs are often lower than pglvs if this assumption holds true also for mixture effects requires further study van der oost et al 2017 focussed on ecological risks and used the background beq consisting of the average beq measured at sites with a good ecological situation multiplied by a factor ranging from 2 to 5 3 2 3 ar calux in the specific case of the ar calux after selection of relevant compounds 16 out of the 18 initial chemicals see fig 1 were still retained to derive an ebt value which amounts to 4 5 ng dht eq l this value is in the same order of magnitude as the ebt value of 11 ng dht eq l derived by brand et al 2013 escher et al 2015 derived an ebt value of 14 ng testosterone equivalents l for the ar calux assay which corresponds to 3 4 ng dht eq l quite similar to the one derived in the present study 3 2 4 pr calux for pr calux only 4 of the 6 compounds initially available were left after excluding chemicals based on the defined criterion furthermore large differences in pglv beq values were found between compounds as shown in fig 1 based on remaining compounds an ebt value of 15 5 ng p4 eq l was calculated on the other hand using the entire dataset an ebt value of 0 223 ng p4 eq l would have been obtained which is much lower than ebt values reported in the literature brand et al 2013 calculated an ebt value which was substantially higher namely 333 ng org2058 eq l which corresponds to 4 5 µg p4 eq l as discussed previously this might be due to the different approach used to derive ebts nevertheless due to the limited number of chemicals available and the lack of other data from the literature the ebt derived here should be only considered as a preliminary indication 3 2 5 gr calux after selection of relevant compounds a total of 6 out of 8 chemicals initially available was used to derive an ebt value of 47 9 ng dex eq l due to the limited number of available compounds the ebt value obtained here should be considered only as a preliminary indication when compared to results from the literature the obtained ebt is in the same order of magnitude as the ebt value of 21 ng dex eq l derived by brand et al 2013 although focused on water quality from an ecotoxicology perspective van der oost et al 2017b reported a slightly higher ebt of 100 ng dex eq l whilst the ebt value derived here does not deviate substantially from results reported in the literature analysis of a broader range of compounds is advisable to corroborate the reliability of the obtained result 3 2 6 pah calux only 3 chemicals out of the 6 initially fulfilled the selection criterion the ebt value was estimated to 24 4 ng bap eq l which lies within the range of ebt values reported in the literature for surface water namely 6 2 ng bap eq l escher et al 2018 and 150 ng bap eq l van der oost et al 2017b inclusion of all available chemicals did not substantially modify the derived ebt value 19 3 ng bap eq l as for pr and gr calux the obtained ebt value should only be viewed as a preliminary threshold due to the limited number of compounds available to derive it additional chemicals should be measured to obtain a larger dataset to derive a reliable ebt for routine monitoring of drinking water quality 3 2 7 nrf2 calux in the specific case of the nrf2 calux only two out of 8 compounds fulfilled the requirements of the selection criterion and an ebt of 16 mg cur eq l was derived whilst when using all available chemicals an ebt value of 1 7 ng cur eq l was obtained the large difference is due to the broad range of pglv beq values as shown in fig 1 van der oost et al 2017b derived a trigger value for the nrf2 calux equal to 10 µg cur eq l whereas the trigger value derived by escher et al 2018 derived for this bioassay amounts to 26 µg dichlorvos eq l which corresponds to 42 µg cur eq l as discussed previously van der oost et al 2017b focused on ecological risks and used background beqs to derive an ebt for oxidative stress due to the effects which are readily measured at sites with good ecological status compared to results from actual measurements the obtained ebt value is substantially higher compared to median responses obtained in the netherlands for raw water used for drinking water production namely 2 8 µg cur eq l personal communication the water laboratorium haarlem the netherlands the limited amount of data available hinders the derivation of reliable ebt values for the nrf2 calux and highlights the need to measure a broader range of compounds before a robust threshold can be derived for routine applications as many chemicals activate oxidative stress bioassays their use to detect specific chemicals or to track removal of chemicals more generally needs further study 3 2 8 p53 calux out of the 18 compounds initially available for this bioassay only 4 fulfilled the selection criterion and an ebt value of 54 µg 2 aaf eq l was estimated whilst an ebt value of 8 pg 2 aaf eq l was obtained using the full dataset this substantial difference is due to the fact that most of the excluded chemicals actually lie in the lower part of the distribution as shown in fig 1 these chemicals were excluded due to their low activity in this particular bioassay further it must be noted that besides genotoxic chemicals also a large set of non genotoxic chemicals are active in this bioassay current guidelines for genotoxic substances that may be potentially carcinogenic assume that there is no safe level chances of adverse effects decrease at lower exposure levels but a theoretical contribution to a health risk always remains since low risk levels of most genotoxic chemicals are much lower than safe levels of non genotoxic chemicals the distribution of pglv beq spans a too large range to derive useful ebt values for all these chemicals no other studies have derived ebt values for the p53 calux or other related stress response bioassays so far similar to the previous bioassay the limited number of compounds available hinders the derivation of an ebt value additional substances need to be tested in this and other genotoxicity bioassays before a reliable threshold can be derived that can be applied in routine 3 3 simulations in the previous section ebt values were determined for a set of calux bioassays based on available pglv beq in an ideal situation one would derive ebt values from a very large set of pglv beq i e from a very large number of substances that i have been tested in the considered bioassays and ii for which enough toxicity information is available to derive a pglv however this is often not the case and ebt values are derived using data from a limited number of substances this introduces uncertainties because depending on the representativeness of the available pglv beq values i e whether they are a representative sample of the population of compounds which could be encountered in practice derived ebt values might not be adequate to assess the quality of water intended for drinking water production in an attempt to quantify the uncertainty surrounding ebt values estimated using only a limited number of compounds an algorithm was developed which uses data derived from the literature and the toxcast data repository united states environmental protection agency 2018 as highlighted previously the goal of the developed algorithm is not to compute actual ebt values to be used in practice but rather to assess the risk that ebt values derived from a limited number of pglv beq might not be able to effectively detect the presence of a potentially harmful compound and as a consequence be unreliable in other terms the oal of the algorithm is to determine the proportion of relevant chemicals giving a response in the bioassay above the established ebt value simulation results are reported in fig 2 in the case of erα anti ar and ar calux analogues the obtained 95 confidence interval 95 ci suggest that with the available number of chemicals the derived ebts would be able to detect 83 or more of potentially harmful chemicals in the case of gr and pah calux analogues it was not possible to obtain substantially more data from the toxcast data repositor i e only 8 and 9 compounds respectively compared to the number of compounds for which calux specific data were available i e 6 see table 1 consequently it cannot be excluded that the estimated proportion of pglv beq theoretical ebt is overly optimistic and that the true 95 ci is actually broader than what was obtained here for nrf2 and p53 calux analogues more relevant data could be recovered from the toxcast data repository namely 22 and 25 pglv beq versus only 2 and 4 for the calux assays respectively in both cases after applying the selection criterion when observing the 95 ci these were much broader indicating that the derived ebt values will likely not be sufficiently low to detect potentially harmful chemicals overall these findings illustrate that if the number of substances relevant for the bioassays available in toxcast is sufficiently large compared to the total number of potential unknown compounds which might be encountered in practice ebt values that are expected to be protective can be derived this was the case for erα anti ar and ar calux analogues it should however be emphasized that the difference between the size of the total population is only roughly twice the size of the number of values drawn e g 16 compounds drawn versus a total population of 39 for erα calux analogues this population can be expected to be only a small proportion of all substances having a comparable activity that may be encountered during water monitoring consequently it is possible that the obtained 95 ci are overoptimistic as the same compounds are more likely to be drawn from smaller populations on the other hand if the number of relevant substances available increases the more likely it is that the derived ebt value will be protective in particular if it is derived as the 5th percentile of the associated log normal distribution these results however also highlight the difficulty of deriving reliable ebt values when only few pglv beq values are available and or their distribution deviates from log normality as is the case for nrf2 p53 and pah calux this can be seen in the obtained 95 ci which are substantially broader compared to the previous 4 assays defining a threshold below which the number of available compounds is deemed too low to derive a reliable ebt value is also difficult as it depends on the variability of responses given by chemicals in a specific assay i e distribution of rep for instance by using 10 or 5 compounds instead of 16 for the erα calux analogue assays the 95 ci interval would broaden to 76 100 or 61 100 respectively to have a 95 chance of covering at least 80 of all chemicals one would need at least 12 compounds likewise for assays analogue to nrf2 calux going from 2 to 8 available compounds to derive an ebt value improves the 95 ci to 82 99 see fig 3 thus in situations where ebt values are derived using a low number of relevant compounds i e less then 8 10 according to the examples shown above which do not cover a representative range of rep it would be advisable to introduce a precautionary factor however the most appropriate approach to overcome this situation is to collect more experimental data for water relevant substances for instance by determining rep for a broader range of compounds for the assay in question or to derive pglv for a larger set of compounds in fact chemicals have often been tested with bioassays i e ec50 have been calculated and rep can hence be derived however there is a lack of information about guideline values for drinking water i e pglv have not been determined enlarging the dataset provides the empirical basis necessary to derive reliable ebt values which can be implemented in regular drinking water quality monitoring 3 4 overview with regard to methods used to derive ebt values results show that these have only a secondary influence on the outcomes nevertheless based on the assumption that pglv beq values follow a normal distribution we suggested to use the 5th percentile of a normal distribution as derivation method the most influential factor in determining the ebt value is the selection criterion used for data inclusion exclusion in this study we bring forward various arguments to support the use of the criterion suggested by escher et al 2015 yet without including the upper boundary this because we consider that highly responsive compounds i e whose pglv beq ec50 10 are relevant and there is no obvious reason why these should be excluded on the other hand non responsive compounds should be excluded because they are likely not relevant for the endpoint considered by the specific bioassay using the abovementioned approach ebt values were derived for calux assays based on the size of the available datasets for each bioassay and the outcome of the simulations ebt values which can be implemented in practice could be obtained for erα anti ar ar and gr calux this was not the case for pr pah nrf2 and p53 calux because either the number of compounds available was too small hence the uncertainty obtained from the simulations was too large or the differences with ebt values from the literature were too large for these bioassays additional studies in particular the collection of a broader dataset i e measuring more compounds and increasing the number of available pglv beq is needed before reliable ebt values can be obtained for non specific bioassays such as nrf2 calux other implementations e g to monitor the removal of bioactive chemicals rather than to detect the presence of potentially risks are also envisaged finally it should be stressed that no unique algorithm is able to derive solid trigger values for all bioassays since unrealistically low ebt values can always be obtained for certain bioassays incorporation of precautionary correction factors based on actual measurements in the water cycle can be considered to increase ebts if these are unrealistically low for instance in other studies assessment factors tang et al 2013 background responses van der oost et al 2017a or mixture toxicity factors escher et al 2018 were used to adjust derived ebt values 3 5 implications of the derived ebt values for drinking water useful ebt values should indicate potential chemical risks yet at the same time they should avoid giving too many false positives the ebt values obtained in this study were compared to empirical data from routine monitoring of drinking water sources in the netherlands to estimate their applicability in practice see supporting information for more details fig 4 shows the boxplots with the measured bioassay activities in the drinking water sources s1 s4 and the corresponding drinking waters d1 d4 for estrogenic activity as measured with erα calux the ebt value is 7 times higher compared to the limit of quantification loq of 0 034 ng e2 eq l in the untreated sources estrogenic activity was regularly detected with median concentrations in the range of 0 051 0 35 ng e2 eq l period 2013 2017 table s1 s3 has a relative high exceedance rate of the ebt value which is notable since it has the lowest anthropogenic influence of the included drinking water sources as seen with the routine monitoring of chemicals an effect directed analysis research has been carried out that tentatively identified e2 as the responsible compound causing this activity in preparation data not shown e2 possibly enters s3 via manure from animal farming in d3 there is no exceedance of the ebt value indicating that e2 is removed during the different drinking water treatment processes also in the other drinking water treatments the compounds causing the estrogenic activity are mostly removed the ebt is exceeded only in drinking water d1 and only in 3 percent of measurements glucorticoid activity as measured with the gr calux is not often detected in untreated drinking water sources and never in drinking water in the period 2013 2017 the ebt value which is one order of magnitude higher than the loq is only exceeded in s1 and s4 in one of the samples fig 4 table s2 anti androgenic activity as measured with the anti ar calux has been analysed since 2016 and is regularly detected in untreated drinking water sources anti androgenic activity is measured above the loq in more than 83 of samples from all sources anti androgenic responses do fluctuate over time in the sources and equivalent concentrations up to 35 µg flut eq l are measured fig 4 the anti androgenic activity decreases during the different water treatment processes and also in d2 d3 and d4 the ebt is sporadically exceeded van der oost et al 2017a found that the background concentrations for anti androgenic activity in unpolluted sites were almost 100 000 times higher than the beq that was considered safe based on ecological toxicity data for the most sensitive organism but also 35 times higher than the beq derived as the 5 hazard concentration in a ssd analysis the group of compounds that are known to have anti androgenic potencies is large and heterogeneous and include polychlorinated biphenyls pesticides and pharmaceuticals e g flutamide aït aïssa et al 2010 hamers et al 2011 houtman et al 2020 but also natural organic matter and humic acids that are considered non toxic bittner et al 2012 this makes it more complicated to derive and interpret an ebt value since the ebt value is exceeded regularly it is advisable to obtain better insights into the compounds that could be responsible for the responses especially in drinking water if the compounds can be identified a more specific risk assessment can be performed and consequently the ebt can be adjusted to reflect realistic risks it must be stressed that an exceedance of an ebt value does not necessary mean that there is a risk however it signals the presence of a hazard induced by one or more potentially harmful compounds at the same time the fact that there are substances with low pglv values but relatively high ec50 means that substances that pose a risk might be present yet these do not elicit an effect in the considered calux assay furthermore if the pglv is very small but the ec50 is within a normal range of values found for other active compounds the bioassay will show an effect for the latter yet because such compound will likely not fulfil the selection criterion i e pglv ec50 0 1 it will not be included in the determination of the ebt and hence might not be detected i e the derived ebt will not be low enough to signal its presence this means that the calux assays in combination with the derived ebt values cannot completely exclude risks i e lack of false negatives especially if only a few bioassays are included in the effect based monitoring strategy rather they can signal the presence of an explicit risk this underlines also that an optimal risk based monitoring strategy for the diagnosis of water quality should include both chemical analyses targeted and non targeted and effect base monitoring brunner et al 2020 in cases in which the measured response in drinking water exceeds the ebt value it is also recommended to repeat the bioassay measurement in the specific location to determine whether the exceedance can reasonably be expected to be incidental if the measured response continues to exceed the ebt value it would be advised to initiate an investigation to find out which compounds are responsible effect directed analysis eda an approach that combines biological analysis with chemical analysis is a promising tool for the detection and identification of the responsible biologically active compound s houtman et al 2018 zwart et al 2018 as discussed previously a compromise should be found between the prevention of false negative and false positive results from a water quality and health perspective the first aspect is of relevance but additional research should also focus on the latter to prevent unnecessary analytical costs or even interruption of drinking water production 4 conclusion bioassays have become an important tool in assessing water quality yet the interpretation of results can be challenging as a positive response does not necessarily implicate a risk for humans consequently effect based trigger values ebt that relate response levels to potential human risks are needed following established procedures we attempted to derive ebt values for a set of eight calux bioassays which could be implemented in practice we developed an innovative algorithm which uses available data about bioassays analogues to the calux assays together with monte carlo simulations to derive ebt values and assess their protective power or in other words their ability to detect the presence of many potentially hazardous chemicals at concentrations close to their provisional health based guidance values in drinking water pglv for four of the considered bioassays namely erα anti ar ar and gr calux the available data were deemed sufficient to derive reliable and realistic ebt values which could be used in practice to monitor the quality of drinking water for the remaining four i e pr pah nrf2 and p53 calux the limited amount of data available as well as the important differences between ebt values obtained here and in the literature prevented their reliable implementation in practice besides testing a larger number of chemicals to obtain more ec50 values from which rep can be calculated there is also a lack of pglv values in fact for quite a large number of substances for which activity was detected in one or more bioassays health guideline values for drinking water are lacking some of the derived ebt values could be compared to actual data from drinking water and sources in the netherlands for erα and gr calux the derived ebt did not seem to cause particularly high exceedances and thus appear to be appropriate for use in routine settings for anti ar calux however higher numbers of exceedances were observed and more insights are required to understand which compounds are causing these whilst obtaining a definitive ebt is still a matter of debate this work provides a framework to derive ebt values and assess their protective power using available data declaration of

17161,micropollutants are ubiquitously found in natural surface waters and pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms stream biofilms consisting of bacteria algae and other microorganisms potentially contribute to bioremediating aquatic environments by biotransforming xenobiotic substances when investigating the potential of stream biofilms to remove micropollutants from the water column it is important to distinguish between different fate processes such as biotransformation passive sorption and active bioaccumulation however due to the complex nature of the biofilm community and its extracellular matrix this task is often difficult in this study we combined biotransformation experiments involving natural stream biofilms collected up and downstream of wastewater treatment plant outfalls with the quechers extraction method to distinguish between the different fate processes the quechers extraction proved to be a suitable method for a broad range of micropollutants 80 of the investigated compounds we found that 31 out of 63 compounds were biotransformed by the biofilms with the majority being substitution type biotransformations and that downstream biofilms have an increased biotransformation potential towards specific wastewater relevant micropollutants overall using the experimental and analytical strategy developed stream biofilms were demonstrated to have a broad inherent micropollutant biotransformation potential and to thus contribute to bioremediation and improving ecosystem health graphical abstract keywords periphyton bioremediation sorption organic contaminants microbial ecotoxicology biofilm extraction 1 introduction worldwide vast amounts of micropollutants mps enter into natural aquatic environments through various pathways including run off from agricultural streams and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents kreuger 1998 schwarzenbach et al 2006 margot et al 2015 aus der beek et al 2016 thus mps such as pharmaceuticals personal care products artificial sweeteners and pesticides end up in complex mixtures in streams and rivers buerge et al 2009 these mps can pose a risk to human and environmental health gavrilescu et al 2015 amongst other effects they may exert a variety of undesired effects on non target organisms such as invertebrates fish or microorganisms which ultimately can lead to alterations in the structure and function of ecosystems caliman and gavrilescu 2009 tlili et al 2017 gad et al 2020 li sharp and drewes 2016 microbial stream biofilms are the most dominant form of life in natural streams battin et al 2003 stream biofilms also referred to as periphyton consist of complex communities of algae bacteria fungi and other microorganisms which are embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix epm and can be attached to any surface in a stream stream biofilms play a key role in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem respiration and as primary producers they form the basis of the food web battin et al 2016 it has been suggested that stream biofilms can also be used to monitor the effects of mps on river ecosystems sabater et al 2007 specifically the concept of pollution induced community tolerance pict can offer insights into whether the presence of mps modulates community responses to chemical stress since it is likely that different species within a community will exhibit different extents of tolerance to mps it is conceivable that upon mp exposure tolerant species within the community are favored while sensitive ones disappear tlili et al 2016 several studies have shown that mps such as diuron ibuprofen and diclofenac can induce pict pesce margoum and montuelle 2010 corcoll et al 2014 this raises the following questions what are the mechanisms underlying pict and how does pict establish in biofilms one conceivable mechanism leading to pict in biofilms is the removal of mps through biotransformation several studies have demonstrated that stream biofilms can remove mps from the aquatic environment by acting as a natural sink schorer and eisele 1997 lawrence et al 2001 winkler lawrence and neu 2001 gantzer et al 1988 however there is rarely any differentiation between possible removal mechanisms on the one hand mps can passively sorb to the epm or cell surfaces within the biofilms on the other hand active biological processes such as bioaccumulation or biotransformation can remove compounds from the water phase however it has to be noted that only biotransformation leads to permanent removal of organic compounds while the other processes are potentially reversible and re release of mps into the water might occur it has been shown that due to the heterogeneous composition of biofilms pesticides with very diverse physico chemical properties can accumulate in biofilms and thus that biofilms could potentially serve as natural passive samplers to better estimate ecological risks mahler et al 2020 a recent review on the role of biofilms in contaminant bioaccumulation revealed the wealth of studies that have been conducted on this topic bonnineau et al 2020 in contrast biotransformation studies in stream biofilms remain limited for example the biotransformation of three carbamate pesticides tien et al 2013 two sulfonamide antibiotics vila costa et al 2017 five endocrine disruptors writer et al 2011 and several single compounds such as venlafaxine rozman acuna and petrovic 2018 alachlor paule et al 2015 and diuron pesce et al 2009 has been investigated however those studies often focus on single substances or small groups of compounds only thus knowledge on the fate of complex mixtures of polar organic mps in stream biofilms is still very limited when investigating biotransformation in natural stream biofilms it is important to be able to distinguish it from other fate processes such as sorption and active bioaccumulation however it is often difficult to reliably quantify accumulated contaminants in biofilms due to the complex nature of the epm bonnineau et al 2020 epm consists mainly of hydrated polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids flemming and wingender 2010 and intercalated into the epm a great variety of different microorganisms is usually found when targeting a wide range of mps with solvent extraction methods those polymeric substances as well as intracellular substances released during extraction steps often lead to analytical interferences and large matrix effects i e ion suppression or enhancement huerta et al 2016 moreover so far we are not aware of any experimental approach that allows distinguishing passive sorption from active bioaccumulation however the two mechanisms are likely to lead to different extents of exposure of the microorganisms and hence need to be distinguished as a consequence of the analytical challenges mentioned and the lack of a robust experimental approach quantification of the different mp fate processes in biofilms including biotransformation has remained challenging in this study we therefore aimed to develop a coherent methodological approach to investigate the fate of complex mixtures of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations in biofilms with a particular focus on distinguishing between biotransformation passive sorption and active bioaccumulation we used this method to investigate the biotransformation potential of natural stream biofilms collected up and downstream of wwtp outfalls towards a large set of structurally diverse environmentally relevant mps with this work we provide valuable methodological guidance and interesting first insights on how biotransformation varies as a function of chemical structure and biofilm exposure history that will help guide future efforts to elucidate the fate of mps in streams 2 methods a summary of the methods including an illustrated overview of the methodological workflow is provided in the si section s1 2 1 compounds a complete list of the 63 target substances used in our experiments can be found in table s1 they were chosen based on their occurrence in treated wastewater and surface water and hence expected relevance to surface waters and to cover multiple use classes i e pesticides pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners and other compounds originating from human activity furthermore we chose substances to cover a broad range of potential initial biotransformation reactions and functional groups including primary secondary and tertiary amides and amines carbamates carboxylic acids chloroacetanilides esters nitriles

from a screening of 389 organic mps and 57 prioritized organic mps conducted in the years 2013 and 2014 respectively can be found in munz et al 2017 biofilms were cultivated in the adjacent rivers up and downstream of the wwtp bup bdown hup hdown the locations were chosen based on previous studies where pict towards mps extracted from passive samplers deployed in the respective wastewater discharges had been demonstrated in both of the respective downstream communities tlili et al 2017 notably at both sites there are no wwtps emitting into the river section upstream of the study site 2 3 biofilm colonization the biofilm colonization period was between 11th of september and 8th of october 2018 a similar system was used as described in tlili et al 2017 shortly three glass slides approximately 910 cm2 per slide which served as growth substrate for the biofilms were mounted in plastic boxes allowing for water flow through the boxes along the slides three biological replicates each consisting of one box with three glass slides were installed at each sampling site such that the top of the substrates was at a depth of 20 30 cm below the water surface after four weeks of colonization the glass slides were removed from the river separately stored in zip bags containing the respective stream water and transported to the laboratory in cooling boxes during the colonization period water quality parameters ph conductivity dissolved o2 were measured in situ on a weekly basis table s2 in addition 1 l weekly grab samples were taken and analyzed in the laboratory for 18 additional water quality parameters according to standard methods table s3 2 4 biotransformation experiments the biofilms contained in one box were scraped of the glass slides and suspended in approximately 400 ml of artificial river water i e periquil stewart behra and sigg 2015 standardization to similar biomass concentrations was achieved by means of od measurements at 685 nm and by further diluting samples with higher biomass concentration to a target absorbance of 0 32 0 05 sample dilution of 4 1 periquil biofilm suspension from these stock suspensions subsamples of 100 ml were taken for the biotransformation experiment bt and a sorption control sc additionally abiotic controls ac were prepared containing only artificial river water samples for sc and ac experiments were autoclaved 121 c 2 bar 20 min before starting the experiment the experiments were conducted in 250 ml schott bottles in a temperature controlled room at 16 c bt batches were exposed to a 12 h light

between the light source and the experimental vessels in order to simulate a water depth of approximately 1 m and to prevent uv light to penetrate the vessels to start the experiment 100 µl of spiking mix was added to each bt sc and ac experimental vessel resulting in a final concentration of approximately 1 µg l of each substance table s1 on the one hand this spiking concentration was chosen based on the study conducted by munz et al 2017 where it was shown that mps from several categories plant protection products food additives corrosion inhibitors and others reached concentrations of several hundered ng l on the other hand we chose the spiking concentration such that concentrations could be followed by means of our analytical methods without further enrichment down to about 95 loss of the initially spiked concentration all experimental vessels were placed on laboratory shakers and shaken circularly at 150 rpm aqueous samples 1 5 ml of the bt batches were taken before and at approximately 0 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 and 96 hours after the start of the experiment while samples of the sc and ac batches were taken before and at approximately 0 4 24 48 and 72 hours after the start of the experiment samples were centrifuged 15 min 4 c 21 130 g the supernatant 1 ml was transferred into an amber hplc vial spiked with 20 µl internal standard mix to a concentration of 0 5 µg l and then immediately frozen biofilm samples for determining solid phase concentrations were taken at 72 and 96 h after the start of the experiment for the sc and bt batches respectively to do so 10 ml of the suspension were sampled centrifuged 15 min 23 c 3 800 g the supernatant discarded and the pellet frozen 80 c until further extraction 2 5 biofilm extraction in order to determine solid phase concentrations a quechers extraction method was used munz et al 2018 biofilm samples were freeze dried spiked with 30 µl internal standard mix 25 µg l and stored overnight at room temperature after addition of 500 mg of 1 mm zirconia silica beads biospec products inc u s a extraction in acn ultrapure h2o 1000 µl 1 1 was performed in a fast prep bead beater mp biomedicals switzerland in two cycles of 15 s at 6 m s with cooling the samples on ice between the cycles then samples were centrifuged 6 min 20 c 20 000 g and 800 µl of the supernatant was added into a vial containing 300 mg quechers salts 4 1 mgso4 nacl agilent technologies shaken immediately and vortexed for approximately 1 min leading to phase separation the samples were then centrifuged 6 min 20 c 20 000 g and 200 µl of the upper organic phase was added into a third vial an additional 500 µl acn was added to the vial containing the biomass and extraction as described above was repeated another 600 µl of the organic phase was added to the third vial and the combined acn phase was then cleaned twice by extraction with heptane 2 500 µl then 700 µl of the acn phase was transferred into an amber hplc vial and stored at 20 c until evaporation under a gentle n2 stream the residue was redissolved in 700 µl ultrapure h2o and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 6 recovery experiment in order to validate the performance of the quechers extraction method with stream biofilm samples recovery experiments were performed freeze dried biofilm samples 100 mg were prepared in triplicate and used in 5 spiking schemes for more details see si section s4 where 40 µl standard 20 µg l and 30 µl internal standard mix 25 µg l were spiked before and or after extraction respectively from these spiking schemes absolute and relative recoveries could be determined as well as the matrix factors the magnitude of these three factors can further be used to estimate the proportional systematic error of the method for every single analyte and could potentially be used to correct e g biases in the measured concentrations of analytes that are due to analytical interferences 2 7 chemical analysis chemical analysis

package ggplot2 wickham 2016 concentration time series were used to calculate first order rate constants kbio over all replicates simultaneously assuming pseudo first order kinetics r2 was used as quality indicator of the fit in order to compare biotransformation trends across the investigated chemicals and the four biofilm communities we level normalized the kbio for each chemical van den berg et al 2006 and created a heatmap using the r package pheatmap kolde 2015 the data used in this manuscript and the corresponding r scripts are freely accessible at https doi org 10 25678 0002j8 2 9 bacterial biomass quantification by flow cytometry during the biotransformation experiment 5 ml samples of the bt batches were taken right before spiking and after 96 h fixated with 5 ml buffer solution 4 paraformaldehyde 0 2 sodium pyrophosphate in glass vials and stored at 4 c until measurement before measuring the samples were sonicated 4 20 s by means of a sonication probe while cooling on ice between cycles the samples were diluted with filtered 0 22 µm millex gp millipore evian water to a final dilution of 1000x stained with 1 sybr green 1 100 dilution in dmso and incubated at 37 c for 10 min before measurement an amount of 50 µl of a 1000 µl sample was then measured on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd accuri san jose ca usa with the fluidics set on fast and a lower threshold on the green fluorescence fl1 set at 800 data processing was done with the bd accuri c6 analysis software 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical performance our selection of mps for this study included 63 compounds containing a variety of different functional groups and covering different hypothesized initial biotransformation reactions five compounds cetirizine caffeine fenofibrate gemfibrozil paracetamol exhibited analytical problems across all sample types and were therefore excluded from further data evaluation cetirizine underwent ethylation to form the corresponding carboxylic acid ester in the etoh spike solution and was later backtransformed to cetirizine during the course of the experiment thus it was not possible to quantify the actual removal of cetirizine caffeine fenofibrate gemfibrozil and paracetamol all exhibited high matrix suppression as recognized from low intensities and bad peak shapes in matrix samples compared to signals from calibration rows in addition we did not have an isotopically labelled analogue of the analyte gemfibrozil which made it difficult to distinguish it from multiple isobars with similar retention times levetiracetam ethofumesate and oxcarbazepine showed high matrix suppression exclusively in the sorption controls these substances were still considered for further data evaluation since evidence from biotransformation experiments was sufficiently clear to be evaluated finally diclofenac had a high loq of 20 of the initially spiked concentration and exhibited considerable noise in the respective chromatograms but was also considered further 3 2 quechers recoveries to evaluate the performance of the quechers method for biofilms absolute and relative recoveries were determined as described in si section s4 for 50 of the 58 evaluated compounds we found relative recoveries between 80 and 120 absolute recovery 29 for another 35 of the compounds the recoveries were still in an acceptable range relative recovery between 70 and 130 absolute recovery 19 table s4 a number of compounds showed worse performance in the recovery experiments i e capecitabine cilastatin diclofenac fenhexamid gabapentin indomethacin kresoxim methyl mianserin and pheniramine recoveries for cilastatin and indomethacin could not be determined because no peaks were detected for those compounds in the quechers extracts diclofenac fenhexamid gabapentin and kresoxim methyl displayed very low absolute recoveries i e 15 and except for gabapentin all of them displayed very low matrix factors i e 20 pheniramine was the only compound for which ion enhancement was relevant as can be seen from the high matrix factor 228 and high absolute recovery 127 overall evaluating the quechers procedure for a large number n 58 of chemically diverse mps in biofilm yielded average relative recoveries of 108 14 standard deviation for 80 of the substances demonstrating that the quechers method is a broadly applicable extraction method for diverse mixtures of mps from biofilms in the following we employed the quechers extraction method to evaluate mass balances for individual mps in the biotransformation and sorption control experiments 3 3 distinguishing biotransformation from sorption and other biological processes for the 58 compounds results from abiotic ac sorption sc and biotransformation bt experiments were compared to classify them according to the fate processes they underwent in order to distinguish biotransformation from any kind of accumulation in the biofilm flocs we extracted the biomass from the bt and sc experiments at the end of the experiment using quechers 3 3 1 abiotically removed compounds three compounds all belonging to the class of strobilurin fungicides showed 30 removal in the abiotic controls ac i e azoxystrobin pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin interestingly these compounds showed less removal in the sorption controls sc over the same time period the three compounds were excluded from further data evaluation as it could not definitely be concluded whether these compounds underwent abiotic transformations or not two additional compounds i e kresoxim methyl and valsartan exhibited minor abiotic removal 15 which however did not interfere with further analysis as biological removal in the bt batches was considerably faster than abiotic removal these two compounds were therefore considered further 3 3 2 persistent compounds thirteen compounds 2 6 dichlorobenzamide acesulfame amisulpride bromoxynil candesartan carbamazepine carbendazim clofibric acid ethofumesate hydrochlorothiazide imidacloprid indomethacin and lamotrigine showed a concentration decrease in the aqueous phase of the bt vessels of 20 in all four of the investigated biofilm communities figure s3 removal of these compounds was too low to yield a statistically significant dissipation signal although in individual cases e g acesulfame in hdown dissipation seemed observable visually lack of statistical significance in those cases was a result of procedural and analytical uncertainties in the order of 10 20 relative standard deviation as obvious from relative standard deviations between experimental replicates at time 0 figures3 overall these compounds were therefore considered recalcitrant to biotransformation by the biofilm communities and under the conditions investigated here in fact these findings are mostly in line with literature acesulfame and carbamazepine for instance are considered conservative tracers and have been shown to be persistent in surface waters bergheim et al 2015 segura et al 2011 tixier et al 2003 buerge et al 2009 li sobek and radke 2016 the pharmaceuticals candesartan and clofibric acid have been shown to be persistent in streams and lake water respectively schaper et al 2018 tixier et al 2003 the half lives of hydrochlorothiazide have been shown to be subject to seasonal effects in surface waters pointing towards phototransformation as the main removal mechanism with biotransformation a minor contributor only zou et al 2015 baena nogueras gonzalez mazo and lara martin 2017 as phototransformation was negligible in our experiments those findings do not contradict the persistence of hydrochlorothiazide in our biofilm experiments recently imidacloprid has been shown to persist in sediment suspensions prepared with lake and river water inocula seller et al 2020 and for indomethacin biological degradation in river water systems was shown to be negligible jimenez et al 2017 the fungicide carbendazim was shown to be biotransformed in wwtps and by complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria kern et al 2010 han et al 2019 but was persistent in freshwater microcosms cuppen et al 2000 the pesticide metabolite 2 6 dichlorobenzamide has been shown to persist in aquatic environments and is regularly found in groundwater samples exceeding maximum allowed concentrations of pesticides and metabolites as defined by the european commission bjorklund et al 2011a b likewise amisulpride and lamotrigine were detected in groundwater and no significant removal was observed in wwtps bollmann et al 2016 thus it is conceivable that they also persist in surface waters while the herbicides bromoxynil and ethofumesate have been demonstrated to be biotransformed in wwtps and wetlands achermann falas et al 2018 helbling et al 2012 degenhardt et al 2011 but ethofumesate was found to be persistent in arable soils laitinen et al 2006 their fate in rivers remains unknown 3 3 3 qualitative distinction between biotransformation sorption and active bioaccumulation for the remaining 42 substances which were not removed abiotically and for which we found a concentration decrease in the aqueous phase of 20 in at least one of the bt batches we considered all experimental evidence to qualitatively differentiate between biotransformation sorption and bioaccumulation i e an active process that can only take place in live biofilms to this end we compared the removal in the bt batches with that of the sc batches and took into consideration the extracted amounts from the quechers extraction these data are compiled exemplarily for three compounds i e atenolol citalopram and isoproturon in fig 1 and for all other compounds in figure s4 atenolol represents the group of compounds that were solely biotransformed and neither sorbed to nor actively accumulated in the biomass as evidenced by i a clear concentration decrease in the concentration time series of the bt batches 48 100 removal within 96 h but not in the sc batches 5 removal and ii hardly any amount found in the quechers extracts of the solid phase at the end of both the bt 2 and sc 5 experiments citalopram was chosen to represent the group of mostly sorbing compounds while we found a concentration decrease in the aqueous phase of the bt batches 43 61 removal within 96 h the compound was also attenuated in the sc batches to a similar extent 8 50 removal we were able to recover the amounts removed from the aqueous phase from both the bt and the sc batches in the quechers extracts of the solid phase for all but the bdown community as is evident from the mass balance plots in fig 1 right panels this indicates that citalopram was biotransformed in the bdown community while it only sorbed to the biomass in the other communities isoproturon was chosen as an example of a compound that did not sorb in the autoclaved sorption controls but rather seemed to be removed through accumulation in the live biofilm whereas we observed a concentration decrease in the bt batches 8 25 removal no corresponding decrease in the aqueous phase concentrations of the sc batches was visible however at the end of the bt experiment we found that we could recover the removed amounts of isoproturon 29 18 in the quechers extracts of the solid phase of the bt batches this indicates that this compound rather than having been passively sorbed must have been actively taken up into components of the biofilm using the same considerations as discussed in detail above for the three compounds in fig 1 we qualitatively assessed each of the 42 substances with respect to the fate processes they underwent these findings are summarized in table 1 as can be seen in table 1 we identified six other compounds besides citalopram i e fipronil kresoxim methyl mianserin pheniramine propranolol and venlafaxine for which removal of the compound was attributable to sorption at least in part interestingly with the exception of fipronil and kresoxim methyl all of these compounds were amine containing substances it is also notable that all of these compounds exhibit rather high logp values 3 table s1 thus indicating that strong sorption to the biofilms correlates at least in part with hydrophobicity and positive charge of the compounds a similar correlation between hydrophobicity and the extent of mp accumulation in stream biofilms has been shown before bonnineau et al 2020 for all other compounds sorption as evident from sorption controls was minor and the majority of removal from the aqueous phase could be attributed to an active biological process by only considering evidence from the aqueous phase one might have concluded that all these compounds were biotransformed however when comparing amounts recovered in the quechers extracts of the solid phase from bt experiments with those from sc experiments we found evidence that besides isoproturon three other compounds 5 methyl benzotriazol 5 2 4 1 in the bt extracts vs 3 0 0 7 in the sc extracts benzotriazol 7 2 4 1 vs 2 4 0 4 and lidocaine 7 7 4 1 vs 2 4 0 5 also showed signs of being actively bioaccumulated in the biofilms yet to a lower extent than isoproturon 29 3 18 3 vs 2 3 0 6 in all three cases and in contrast to the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon active bioaccumulation seemed to occur in combination with biotransformation phenylurea herbicides e g diuron and isoproturon have been shown before to accumulate in pond biofilms chaumet et al 2019 and microbial biofilms from river sediments trinh hiscock and reid 2012 for the remaining 31 compounds biotransformation seemed to be the major removal mechanism however it needs to be noted that for seven of these compounds eprosartan gabapentin levamisole levetiracetam mecoprop oxcarbazepine ranitidine active bioaccumulation could not be excluded as we were not able to quantify amounts extracted from the solid phase and for levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine we also cannot rule out sorption as a removal mechanism because we could not acquire aqueous phase concentrations from the sorption controls either 3 3 4 delayed onset of biotransformation another distinct pattern that we observed involved the amine containing compounds citalopram levamisol lidocaine metoprolol pheniramine propranolol and venlafaxine in fig 2 a example concentration time series from the bt batches for this group are displayed all of these compounds showed a lag phase of about two days in the bdown community followed by a concentration decrease that could be attributed to biotransformation as described above for most of these compounds ion trapping in acidic vesicles of protozoa has been shown to be a relevant removal mechanisms in activated sludge gulde et al 2018 as we could not recover the removed amounts from the solid phase of bdown at the end of the biotransformation experiment we doubt that these compounds have been trapped as previously described but they rather were biotransformed 3 4 patterns in biotransformation rate constants for the 31 compounds that we hypothesize to mostly undergo biotransformation based on the above considerations we used the aqueous phase concentration time series of the bt batches to obtain pseudo first order degradation rate constants calculated biotransformation rate constants kbio for the investigated compounds and biofilm communities and coefficients of determination r2 of the fits are listed in table 1 since r2 describes the extent of variability in concentration between sampling points that can be explained by the factor time low r2 values coincided with low kbio values corresponding to low removal 20 30 in the respective batches we identified 13 compounds i e atenolol capecitabine cilastatin fenhexamid oxcarbazepine propachlor ranitidine sulfadiazine sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole sulfapyridine sulfathiazole trinexapac ethyl that were clearly biotransformed i e kbio values 0 055 day 1 corresponding to a 20 concentration decrease after 4 days in all four biofilm communities when comparing with information on biotransformation reactions in activated sludge it is noteworthy that most of these compounds with the exception of fenhexamid ranitidine and oxcarbazepine had been observed to undergo nucleophilic substitution type primary biotransformation reactions i e hydrolysis reactions conjugations for instance the sulfonamide antibiotics investigated here have been shown to undergo a variety of substitution reactions in cobble biofilms vila costa et al 2017 and pterin conjugations in activated sludge achermann bianco et al 2018 the primary and secondary amides atenolol and cilastatin respectively and the ester trinexapac ethyl have been found to undergo hydrolysis biotransformation reactions in activated sludge while the chloroacetanilide propachlor underwent substitution at the c cl moiety most likely through substitution by glutathione achermann falas et al 2018 the enzymes catalyzing these reactions i e dihydropteroate synthases amidohydrolases esterases glutathione s transferases are key enzymes supporting assimilation growth and defense processes and are therefore thought to be ubiquitous among different types of bacteria johnson et al 2015 this most likely explains why all of the investigated biofilms seemed to harbor the potential to biotransform these still structurally diverse mps next we looked for trends in biotransformation potential across the 31 biotransformed chemicals and the four different biofilm communities to do so we clustered the level normalized rate constants according to their relative transformation behavior across the four sites resulting in three main clusters across the investigated mps fig 3 one very distinct cluster contained the two artificial sweeteners cyclamate and saccharin the insect repellent deet the insecticide thiacloprid and the pharmaceutical levetiracetam those five compounds were all exclusively biotransformed by the hdown biofilms but remained persistent in the other communities examples shown in fig 2b this finding is consistent with results from pre experiments si section s6 where we even found exclusive biotransformation in both downstream communities hdown and bdown for those same compounds also in those pre experiments we observed a clear dissipation signal for the artificial sweetener acesulfame in the hdown community whereas in the data presented here dissipation was visible but not statistically significant a similar pattern of biotransformation being exclusively observed downstream of wwtp outfalls has recently been reported for acesulfame in sediments coll et al 2020 two possible mechanisms might explain why certain compounds are exclusively biotransformed in communities that are impacted to some extent by treated wastewater first it is feasible that the microorganisms within the downstream biofilms responded to the selective pressure from the wwtp effluent leading to changes in the community composition and function which in turn lead to the observed increased biotransformation potential alternatively wastewater bacteria capable of biotransforming these compounds may be transferred via the wwtp effluents into the downstream communities leading to the increased biotransformation potential as observed in hdown artificial sweeteners particularly acesulfame are well known to be present in high concentrations up to several µg l in downstream surface waters munz et al 2017 bergheim et al 2015 thus potentially serving the downstream biofilms as a carbon source however efficient removal of acesulfame cyclamate and saccharin in wwtps has also been shown buerge et al 2009 castronovo et al 2017 li et al 2018 suggesting that wwtp bacteria are well capable to biotransform these compounds it has already been demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance genes can be transferred from wwtps into stream biofilms marti jofre and balcazar 2013 proia et al 2016 subirats et al 2017 and it is thus also conceivable that bacteria capable to biotransform mps or their genes can be released from wwtps and manifest in downstream biofilms we also note that the phenomenon of increased biotransformation potential at downstream sites was not fully consistent across our experiments while it was observed at both downstream sites in the pre experiment it was only observed at hdown in the main experiment also one compound acesulfame only showed a clear signature in the pre experiments but not in the main experiments the variability in these observations could be due to various factors including different environmental conditions e g temperature solar irradiation or discharge or changes in operational conditions in the wwtp the operators of wwtp buttisholz confirmed that no fundamental changes in the operation of the wwtp were made between the two experimental periods hence this possibility can be ruled out further research will be needed to understand the variability of the observed downstream phenomenon and the underlying mechanisms in particular information on the biotransformation potential of the activated sludge microbial community of the respective wwtps and the load of microorganisms released by the wwtp in combination with taxonomic information e g from 16s rrna amplicon sequencing could possibly help to elucidate this phenomenon the second and largest cluster contained 18 compounds e g atenolol trinexapac ethyl rufinamide that showed generally faster biotransformation in the hochdorf communities hup and hdown compared to the buttisholz communities bup and bdown even though contamination patterns between up and downstream sites have been shown to differ munz et al 2017 no significant differences in contamination patterns were found between hochdorf and buttisholz that would explain this finding thus pre exposure to higher concentrations may not be the cause of this phenomenon however one distinguishing feature between the communities from those two sites is that bacterial cell counts at the beginning of the experiment were higher by a factor of 2 3 in the hochdorf communities compared to the buttisholz communities fig 4 higher biomass might explain the increased biotransformation potential at hochdorf to some extent considering that we have evidence from previous work with activated sludge that the transformation potential for most of these compounds is widespread among bacteria achermann falas et al 2018 it may also be the case that higher initial cell numbers lead to an overall higher bacterial diversity jaeger et al 2019 thus increasing the likelihood of rarer species to be present and adding to the biotransformation potential of the biofilms johnson et al 2015 the third cluster that we identified contained eight compounds i e dimethenamid propachlor sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sulfathiazole sulfamethazine sulfapyridine levamisol that were biotransformed fastest but not exclusively in the bdown community interestingly all five sulfonamide antibiotics and both chloroacetanilides that we investigated were found in this cluster the sulfonamide antibiotics have been previously described to follow a pterin sulfonamide conjugation pathway in activated sludge achermann bianco et al 2018 which is catalyzed by an enzyme i e dihydropteroate synthase that is part of the folate synthesis pathway as folic acid is essential for protein and nucleic acid synthesis the enzymes involved in this pathway are ubiquitous among bacteria and inherently linked to growth initial biotransformation reactions of the chloroacetanilides i e dimethenamid propachlor have been shown to mostly occur via glutathione s transferase mediated conjugations singh and singh 2016 achermann falas et al 2018 the primary role of these enzymes is detoxification and they are upregulated in response to oxidative stress from fig 4 it can be seen that bacterial numbers increased most strongly between 0 and 96 hours in the bdown community resulting in highest cell numbers at 96 hours neglecting potential differences in cell decay rates it can therefore be assumed that bacterial growth rates were highest in bdown while we do not fully understand the reasons behind the high growth rates at bdown this site has the highest native nutrient and cod contents table s3 it could thus be speculated that the bdown community was best adapted to the nutrient rich medium used in the biotransformation experiments this would potentially explain the increased biotransformation potential for the sulfonamides and chloroacetanilides for which the enzymes assumed to be responsible for their initial biotransformation reaction are known to be intimately linked to cell growth and defense against oxidative stress achermann bianco et al 2018 roland et al 1979 achermann falas et al 2018 singh and singh 2016 however to further support these conclusions additional experiments with varying amounts of initial biomass and analysis of transformation product formation would be required 3 5 environmental relevance and implications overall we presented in this study for the first time a complete mass balance procedure that can be used to study the fate of a large number of structurally diverse mps in biofilms particularly we demonstrated that the quechers extraction procedure allowed satisfactory recovery for 80 of the mps investigated this not only allows assessing the role of river biofilms in decontaminating surface waters from xenobiotic substances but also provides new evidence and opportunities to further investigate the potential use of river biofilms for effect based monitoring and as bioassay in chemical risk assessment we found that the extent of passive sorption to biofilms mostly depends on the compounds hydrophobicity and charge with a strong preference for sorption of positively charged compounds i e amine containing compounds this is qualitatively consistent with sorption to other sediment organic materials but would require more quantitative studies to e g evaluate the suitability of river biofilms as natural passive samplers writer ryan and barber 2011 this is even more so since we also observed signs of active bioaccumulation of specific substances further exploration of this phenomenon would require a more spatially and temporally resolved analysis of individual biofilm components to understand the dynamics and define compartments where the active accumulation takes place for the herbicide isoproturon specifically it would be particularly important to see whether it accumulates into the photoautotrophic members where it might exert specific toxic effects this was the first study investigating the biotransformation potential of stream biofilms involving a large number of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations we found that roughly half of the 63 compounds investigated were biotransformed to some extent by the four biofilm microbial communities however observed biotransformation reactions mostly corresponded to substitution type reactions most likely catalyzed by a limited number of enzymes that are ubiquitous among different types of bacteria because they support central metabolic processes the biotransformation rate constants of mps undergoing those transformations accordingly scaled with either bacterial biomass or biomass growth as quantified with flow cytometry more specialized transformations of a number of mps including the artificial sweeteners studied was only observed for one of the two downstream communities in this study with some evidence from pre experiments that transformation of the same compounds takes place more generally in downstream communities this suggests that the treated effluents of wastewater treatment plants tend to increase not only the pollution induced community tolerance pict of downstream biofilms as demonstrated previously tlili et al 2017 but also their biotransformation capacity for certain mps while in the case of pict and contaminant transformation these effects might be considered positive as they point towards lowered risk from chemical exposure the findings also raise the question what other biofilm functions are affected by the treated effluents and whether all of these effects can be considered positive from an ecosystem health perspective to address this ecologically highly relevant question more controlled experiments are warranted that allow differentiating the underlying mechanisms i e in stream adaptation to chemical exposure or import of biological material from wwtps and to clarify how far downstream of the wwtp the observed effects actually extend 4 conclusion in this study we collected biofilms at two field study sites and used a combination of batch experiments chemical analytical and biological methods methods to investigate the micropollutant biotransformation potential of natural stream biofilms the major conclusions of this study are the quechers extraction method proved to be a broadly applicable extraction method for a diverse set of micropollutants even for a highly complex and biologically heterogeneous matrix such as biofilm natural stream biofilms were found to possess a broad inherent micropollutant biotransformation potential i e 26 out of 59 investigated mps were biotransformed in several biofilm communities thus contributing to bioremediation and improving ecosystem health of natural surface waters through complete mass balance analysis active bioaccumulation into biofilms could be demonstrated for a number of compounds input of treated wastewater clearly changed the micropollutant biotransformation potential of downstream biofilms and hence their ecological function resulting in increased biotransformation for a number of compounds particularly artificial sweeteners declaration of competing

17161,micropollutants are ubiquitously found in natural surface waters and pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms stream biofilms consisting of bacteria algae and other microorganisms potentially contribute to bioremediating aquatic environments by biotransforming xenobiotic substances when investigating the potential of stream biofilms to remove micropollutants from the water column it is important to distinguish between different fate processes such as biotransformation passive sorption and active bioaccumulation however due to the complex nature of the biofilm community and its extracellular matrix this task is often difficult in this study we combined biotransformation experiments involving natural stream biofilms collected up and downstream of wastewater treatment plant outfalls with the quechers extraction method to distinguish between the different fate processes the quechers extraction proved to be a suitable method for a broad range of micropollutants 80 of the investigated compounds we found that 31 out of 63 compounds were biotransformed by the biofilms with the majority being substitution type biotransformations and that downstream biofilms have an increased biotransformation potential towards specific wastewater relevant micropollutants overall using the experimental and analytical strategy developed stream biofilms were demonstrated to have a broad inherent micropollutant biotransformation potential and to thus contribute to bioremediation and improving ecosystem health graphical abstract keywords periphyton bioremediation sorption organic contaminants microbial ecotoxicology biofilm extraction 1 introduction worldwide vast amounts of micropollutants mps enter into natural aquatic environments through various pathways including run off from agricultural streams and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents kreuger 1998 schwarzenbach et al 2006 margot et al 2015 aus der beek et al 2016 thus mps such as pharmaceuticals personal care products artificial sweeteners and pesticides end up in complex mixtures in streams and rivers buerge et al 2009 these mps can pose a risk to human and environmental health gavrilescu et al 2015 amongst other effects they may exert a variety of undesired effects on non target organisms such as invertebrates fish or microorganisms which ultimately can lead to alterations in the structure and function of ecosystems caliman and gavrilescu 2009 tlili et al 2017 gad et al 2020 li sharp and drewes 2016 microbial stream biofilms are the most dominant form of life in natural streams battin et al 2003 stream biofilms also referred to as periphyton consist of complex communities of algae bacteria fungi and other microorganisms which are embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix epm and can be attached to any surface in a stream stream biofilms play a key role in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem respiration and as primary producers they form the basis of the food web battin et al 2016 it has been suggested that stream biofilms can also be used to monitor the effects of mps on river ecosystems sabater et al 2007 specifically the concept of pollution induced community tolerance pict can offer insights into whether the presence of mps modulates community responses to chemical stress since it is likely that different species within a community will exhibit different extents of tolerance to mps it is conceivable that upon mp exposure tolerant species within the community are favored while sensitive ones disappear tlili et al 2016 several studies have shown that mps such as diuron ibuprofen and diclofenac can induce pict pesce margoum and montuelle 2010 corcoll et al 2014 this raises the following questions what are the mechanisms underlying pict and how does pict establish in biofilms one conceivable mechanism leading to pict in biofilms is the removal of mps through biotransformation several studies have demonstrated that stream biofilms can remove mps from the aquatic environment by acting as a natural sink schorer and eisele 1997 lawrence et al 2001 winkler lawrence and neu 2001 gantzer et al 1988 however there is rarely any differentiation between possible removal mechanisms on the one hand mps can passively sorb to the epm or cell surfaces within the biofilms on the other hand active biological processes such as bioaccumulation or biotransformation can remove compounds from the water phase however it has to be noted that only biotransformation leads to permanent removal of organic compounds while the other processes are potentially reversible and re release of mps into the water might occur it has been shown that due to the heterogeneous composition of biofilms pesticides with very diverse physico chemical properties can accumulate in biofilms and thus that biofilms could potentially serve as natural passive samplers to better estimate ecological risks mahler et al 2020 a recent review on the role of biofilms in contaminant bioaccumulation revealed the wealth of studies that have been conducted on this topic bonnineau et al 2020 in contrast biotransformation studies in stream biofilms remain limited for example the biotransformation of three carbamate pesticides tien et al 2013 two sulfonamide antibiotics vila costa et al 2017 five endocrine disruptors writer et al 2011 and several single compounds such as venlafaxine rozman acuna and petrovic 2018 alachlor paule et al 2015 and diuron pesce et al 2009 has been investigated however those studies often focus on single substances or small groups of compounds only thus knowledge on the fate of complex mixtures of polar organic mps in stream biofilms is still very limited when investigating biotransformation in natural stream biofilms it is important to be able to distinguish it from other fate processes such as sorption and active bioaccumulation however it is often difficult to reliably quantify accumulated contaminants in biofilms due to the complex nature of the epm bonnineau et al 2020 epm consists mainly of hydrated polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids flemming and wingender 2010 and intercalated into the epm a great variety of different microorganisms is usually found when targeting a wide range of mps with solvent extraction methods those polymeric substances as well as intracellular substances released during extraction steps often lead to analytical interferences and large matrix effects i e ion suppression or enhancement huerta et al 2016 moreover so far we are not aware of any experimental approach that allows distinguishing passive sorption from active bioaccumulation however the two mechanisms are likely to lead to different extents of exposure of the microorganisms and hence need to be distinguished as a consequence of the analytical challenges mentioned and the lack of a robust experimental approach quantification of the different mp fate processes in biofilms including biotransformation has remained challenging in this study we therefore aimed to develop a coherent methodological approach to investigate the fate of complex mixtures of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations in biofilms with a particular focus on distinguishing between biotransformation passive sorption and active bioaccumulation we used this method to investigate the biotransformation potential of natural stream biofilms collected up and downstream of wwtp outfalls towards a large set of structurally diverse environmentally relevant mps with this work we provide valuable methodological guidance and interesting first insights on how biotransformation varies as a function of chemical structure and biofilm exposure history that will help guide future efforts to elucidate the fate of mps in streams 2 methods a summary of the methods including an illustrated overview of the methodological workflow is provided in the si section s1 2 1 compounds a complete list of the 63 target substances used in our experiments can be found in table s1 they were chosen based on their occurrence in treated wastewater and surface water and hence expected relevance to surface waters and to cover multiple use classes i e pesticides pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners and other compounds originating from human activity furthermore we chose substances to cover a broad range of potential initial biotransformation reactions and functional groups including primary secondary and tertiary amides and amines carbamates carboxylic acids chloroacetanilides esters nitriles sulfonamides triazoles and halogenated compounds hplc grade chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich gmbh honeywell specialty chemicals hpc standards gmbh dr ehrenstorfer gmbh and toronto research

biological treatment while hochdorf serves 50 000 pe and has a mechanical biological treatment with advanced p elimination and nitrification further information on the wwtps the land use and results from a screening of 389 organic mps and 57 prioritized organic mps conducted in the years 2013 and 2014 respectively can be found in munz et al 2017 biofilms were cultivated in the adjacent rivers up and downstream of the wwtp bup bdown hup hdown the locations were chosen based on previous studies where pict towards mps extracted from passive samplers deployed in the respective wastewater discharges had been demonstrated in both of the respective downstream communities tlili et al 2017 notably at both sites there are no wwtps emitting into the river section upstream of the study site 2 3 biofilm colonization the biofilm colonization period was between 11th of september and 8th of october 2018 a similar system was used as described in tlili et al 2017 shortly three glass slides approximately 910 cm2 per slide which served as growth substrate for the biofilms were mounted in plastic boxes allowing for water flow through the boxes along the slides three biological replicates each consisting of one box with three glass slides were installed at each sampling site such that the top of the substrates was at a depth of 20 30 cm below the water surface after four weeks of colonization the glass slides were removed from the river separately stored in zip bags containing the respective stream water and transported to the laboratory in cooling boxes during the colonization period water quality parameters ph conductivity dissolved o2 were measured in situ on a weekly basis table s2 in addition 1 l weekly grab samples were taken and analyzed in the laboratory for 18 additional water quality parameters according to standard methods table s3 2 4 biotransformation experiments the biofilms contained in one box were scraped of the glass slides and suspended in approximately 400 ml of artificial river water i e periquil stewart behra and sigg 2015 standardization to similar biomass concentrations was achieved by means of od measurements at 685 nm and by further diluting samples with higher biomass concentration to a target absorbance of 0 32 0 05 sample dilution of 4 1 periquil biofilm suspension from these stock suspensions subsamples of 100 ml were taken for the biotransformation experiment bt and a sorption control sc additionally abiotic controls ac were prepared containing only artificial river water samples for sc and ac experiments were autoclaved 121 c 2 bar 20 min before starting the experiment the experiments were conducted in 250 ml schott bottles in a temperature controlled room at 16 c bt batches were exposed to a 12 h light

between the light source and the experimental vessels in order to simulate a water depth of approximately 1 m and to prevent uv light to penetrate the vessels to start the experiment 100 µl of spiking mix was added to each bt sc and ac experimental vessel resulting in a final concentration of approximately 1 µg l of each substance table s1 on the one hand this spiking concentration was chosen based on the study conducted by munz et al 2017 where it was shown that mps from several categories plant protection products food additives corrosion inhibitors and others reached concentrations of several hundered ng l on the other hand we chose the spiking concentration such that concentrations could be followed by means of our analytical methods without further enrichment down to about 95 loss of the initially spiked concentration all experimental vessels were placed on laboratory shakers and shaken circularly at 150 rpm aqueous samples 1 5 ml of the bt batches were taken before and at approximately 0 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 and 96 hours after the start of the experiment while samples of the sc and ac batches were taken before and at approximately 0 4 24 48 and 72 hours after the start of the experiment samples were centrifuged 15 min 4 c 21 130 g the supernatant 1 ml was transferred into an amber hplc vial spiked with 20 µl internal standard mix to a concentration of 0 5 µg l and then immediately frozen biofilm samples for determining solid phase concentrations were taken at 72 and 96 h after the start of the experiment for the sc and bt batches respectively to do so 10 ml of the suspension were sampled centrifuged 15 min 23 c 3 800 g the supernatant discarded and the pellet frozen 80 c until further extraction 2 5 biofilm extraction in order to determine solid phase concentrations a quechers extraction method was used munz et al 2018 biofilm samples were freeze dried spiked with 30 µl internal standard mix 25 µg l and stored overnight at room temperature after addition of 500 mg of 1 mm zirconia silica beads biospec products inc u s a extraction in acn ultrapure h2o 1000 µl 1 1 was performed in a fast prep bead beater mp biomedicals switzerland in two cycles of 15 s at 6 m s with cooling the samples on ice between the cycles then samples were centrifuged 6 min 20 c 20 000 g and 800 µl of the supernatant was added into a vial containing 300 mg quechers salts 4 1 mgso4 nacl agilent technologies shaken immediately and vortexed for approximately 1 min leading to phase separation the samples were then centrifuged 6 min 20 c 20 000 g and 200 µl of the upper organic phase was added into a third vial an additional 500 µl acn was added to the vial containing the biomass and extraction as described above was repeated another 600 µl of the organic phase was added to the third vial and the combined acn phase was then cleaned twice by extraction with heptane 2 500 µl then 700 µl of the acn phase was transferred into an amber hplc vial and stored at 20 c until evaporation under a gentle n2 stream the residue was redissolved in 700 µl ultrapure h2o and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 6 recovery experiment in order to validate the performance of the quechers extraction method with stream biofilm samples recovery experiments were performed freeze dried biofilm samples 100 mg were prepared in triplicate and used in 5 spiking schemes for more details see si section s4 where 40 µl standard 20 µg l and 30 µl internal standard mix 25 µg l were spiked before and or after extraction respectively from these spiking schemes absolute and relative recoveries could be determined as well as the matrix factors the magnitude of these three factors can further be used to estimate the proportional systematic error of the method for every single analyte and could potentially be used to correct e g biases in the measured concentrations of analytes that are due to analytical interferences 2 7 chemical analysis chemical analysis

bacterial biomass quantification by flow cytometry during the biotransformation experiment 5 ml samples of the bt batches were taken right before spiking and after 96 h fixated with 5 ml buffer

for 10 min before measurement an amount of 50 µl of a 1000 µl sample was then measured on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd accuri san jose ca usa with the fluidics set on fast and a lower threshold on the green fluorescence fl1 set at 800 data processing was done with the bd accuri c6 analysis software 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical performance our selection of mps for this study included 63 compounds containing a variety of different functional groups and covering different hypothesized initial biotransformation reactions five compounds cetirizine caffeine fenofibrate gemfibrozil paracetamol exhibited analytical problems across all sample types and were therefore excluded from further data evaluation cetirizine underwent ethylation to form the corresponding carboxylic acid ester in the etoh spike solution and was later backtransformed to cetirizine during the course of the experiment thus it was not possible to quantify the actual removal of cetirizine caffeine fenofibrate gemfibrozil and paracetamol all exhibited high matrix suppression as recognized from low intensities and bad peak shapes in matrix samples compared to signals from calibration rows in addition we did not have an isotopically labelled analogue of the analyte gemfibrozil which made it difficult to distinguish it from multiple isobars with similar retention times levetiracetam ethofumesate and oxcarbazepine showed high matrix suppression exclusively in the sorption controls these substances were still considered for further data evaluation since evidence from biotransformation experiments was sufficiently clear to be evaluated finally diclofenac had a high loq of 20 of the initially spiked concentration and exhibited considerable noise in the respective chromatograms but was also considered further 3 2 quechers recoveries to evaluate the performance of the quechers method for biofilms absolute and relative recoveries were determined as described in si section s4 for 50 of the 58 evaluated compounds we found relative recoveries between 80 and 120 absolute recovery 29 for another 35 of the compounds the recoveries were still in an acceptable range relative recovery between 70 and 130 absolute recovery 19 table s4 a number of compounds showed worse performance in the recovery experiments i e capecitabine cilastatin diclofenac fenhexamid gabapentin indomethacin kresoxim methyl mianserin and pheniramine recoveries for cilastatin and indomethacin could not be determined because no peaks were detected for those compounds in the quechers extracts diclofenac fenhexamid gabapentin and kresoxim methyl displayed very low absolute recoveries i e 15 and except for gabapentin all of them displayed very low matrix factors i e 20 pheniramine was the only compound for which ion enhancement was relevant as can be seen from the high matrix factor 228 and high absolute recovery 127 overall evaluating the quechers procedure for a large number n 58 of chemically diverse mps in biofilm yielded average relative recoveries of 108 14 standard deviation for 80 of the substances demonstrating that the quechers method is a broadly applicable extraction method for diverse mixtures of mps from biofilms in the following we employed the quechers extraction method to evaluate mass balances for individual mps in the biotransformation and sorption control experiments 3 3 distinguishing biotransformation from sorption and other biological processes for the 58 compounds results from abiotic ac sorption sc and biotransformation bt experiments were compared to classify them according to the fate processes they underwent in order to distinguish biotransformation from any kind of accumulation in the biofilm flocs we extracted the biomass from the bt and sc experiments at the end of the experiment using quechers 3 3 1 abiotically removed compounds three compounds all belonging to the class of strobilurin fungicides showed 30 removal in the abiotic controls ac i e azoxystrobin pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin interestingly these compounds showed less removal in the sorption controls sc over the same time period the three compounds were excluded from further data evaluation as it could not definitely be concluded whether these compounds underwent abiotic transformations or not two additional compounds i e kresoxim methyl and valsartan exhibited minor abiotic removal 15 which however did not interfere with further analysis as biological removal in the bt batches was considerably faster than abiotic removal these two compounds were therefore considered further 3 3 2 persistent compounds thirteen compounds 2 6 dichlorobenzamide acesulfame amisulpride bromoxynil candesartan carbamazepine carbendazim clofibric acid ethofumesate hydrochlorothiazide imidacloprid indomethacin and lamotrigine showed a concentration decrease in the aqueous phase of the bt vessels of 20 in all four of the investigated biofilm communities figure s3 removal of these compounds was too low to yield a statistically significant dissipation signal although in individual cases e g acesulfame in hdown dissipation seemed observable visually lack of statistical significance in those cases was a result of procedural and analytical uncertainties in the order of 10 20 relative standard deviation as obvious from relative standard deviations between experimental replicates at time 0 figures3 overall these compounds were therefore considered recalcitrant to biotransformation by the biofilm communities and under the conditions investigated here in fact these findings are mostly in line with literature acesulfame and carbamazepine for instance are considered conservative tracers and have been shown to be persistent in surface waters bergheim et al 2015 segura et al 2011 tixier et al 2003 buerge et al 2009 li sobek and radke 2016 the pharmaceuticals candesartan and clofibric acid have been shown to be persistent in streams and lake water respectively schaper et al 2018 tixier et al 2003 the half lives of hydrochlorothiazide have been shown to be subject to seasonal effects in surface waters pointing towards phototransformation as the main removal mechanism with biotransformation a minor contributor only zou et al 2015 baena nogueras gonzalez mazo and lara martin 2017 as phototransformation was negligible in our experiments those findings do not contradict the persistence of hydrochlorothiazide in our biofilm experiments recently imidacloprid has been shown to persist in sediment suspensions prepared with lake and river water inocula seller et al 2020 and for indomethacin biological degradation in river water systems was shown to be negligible jimenez et al 2017 the fungicide carbendazim was shown to be biotransformed in wwtps and by complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria kern et al 2010 han et al 2019 but was persistent in freshwater microcosms cuppen et al 2000 the pesticide metabolite 2 6 dichlorobenzamide has been shown to persist in aquatic environments and is regularly found in groundwater samples exceeding maximum allowed concentrations of pesticides and metabolites as defined by the european commission bjorklund et al 2011a b likewise amisulpride and lamotrigine were detected in groundwater and no significant removal was observed in wwtps bollmann et al 2016 thus it is conceivable that they also persist in surface waters while the herbicides bromoxynil and ethofumesate have been demonstrated to be biotransformed in wwtps and wetlands achermann falas et al 2018 helbling et al 2012 degenhardt et al 2011 but ethofumesate was found to be persistent in arable soils laitinen et al 2006 their fate in rivers remains unknown 3 3 3 qualitative distinction between biotransformation sorption and active bioaccumulation for the remaining 42 substances which were not removed abiotically and for which we found a concentration decrease in the aqueous phase of 20 in at least one of the bt batches we considered all experimental evidence to qualitatively differentiate between biotransformation sorption and bioaccumulation i e an active process that can only take place in live biofilms to this end we compared the removal in the bt batches with that of the sc batches and took into consideration the extracted amounts from the quechers extraction these data are compiled exemplarily for three compounds i e atenolol citalopram and isoproturon in fig 1 and for all other compounds in figure s4 atenolol represents the group of compounds that were solely biotransformed and neither sorbed to nor actively accumulated in the biomass as evidenced by i a clear concentration decrease in the concentration time series of the bt batches 48 100 removal within 96 h but not in the sc batches 5 removal and ii hardly any amount found in the quechers extracts of the solid phase at the end of both the bt 2 and sc 5 experiments citalopram was chosen to represent the group of mostly sorbing compounds while we found a concentration decrease in the aqueous phase of the bt batches 43 61 removal within 96 h the compound was also attenuated in the sc batches to a similar extent 8 50 removal we were able to recover the amounts removed from the aqueous phase from both the bt and the sc batches in the quechers extracts of the solid phase for all but the bdown community as is evident from the mass balance plots in fig 1 right panels this indicates that citalopram was biotransformed in the bdown community while it only sorbed to the biomass in the other communities isoproturon was chosen as an example of a compound that did not sorb in the autoclaved sorption controls but rather seemed to be removed through accumulation in the live biofilm whereas we observed a concentration decrease in the bt batches 8 25 removal no corresponding decrease in the aqueous phase concentrations of the sc batches was visible however at the end of the bt experiment we found that we could recover the removed amounts of isoproturon 29 18 in the quechers extracts of the solid phase of the bt batches this indicates that this compound rather than having been passively sorbed must have been actively taken up into components of the biofilm using the same considerations as discussed in detail above for the three compounds in fig 1 we qualitatively assessed each of the 42 substances with respect to the fate processes they underwent these findings are summarized in table 1 as can be seen in table 1 we identified six other compounds besides citalopram i e fipronil kresoxim methyl mianserin pheniramine propranolol and venlafaxine for which removal of the compound was attributable to sorption at least in part interestingly with the exception of fipronil and kresoxim methyl all of these compounds were amine containing substances it is also notable that all of these compounds exhibit rather high logp values 3 table s1 thus indicating that strong sorption to the biofilms correlates at least in part with hydrophobicity and positive charge of the compounds a similar correlation between hydrophobicity and the extent of mp accumulation in stream biofilms has been shown before bonnineau et al 2020 for all other compounds sorption as evident from sorption controls was minor and the majority of removal from the aqueous phase could be attributed to an active biological process by only considering evidence from the aqueous phase one might have concluded that all these compounds were biotransformed however when comparing amounts recovered in the quechers extracts of the solid phase from bt experiments with those from sc experiments we found evidence that besides isoproturon three other compounds 5 methyl benzotriazol 5 2 4 1 in the bt extracts vs 3 0 0 7 in the sc extracts benzotriazol 7 2 4 1 vs 2 4 0 4 and lidocaine 7 7 4 1 vs 2 4 0 5 also showed signs of being actively bioaccumulated in the biofilms yet to a lower extent than isoproturon 29 3 18 3 vs 2 3 0 6 in all three cases and in contrast to the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon active bioaccumulation seemed to occur in combination with biotransformation phenylurea herbicides e g diuron and isoproturon have been shown before to accumulate in pond biofilms chaumet et al 2019 and microbial biofilms from river sediments trinh hiscock and reid 2012 for the remaining 31 compounds biotransformation seemed to be the major removal mechanism however it needs to be noted that for seven of these compounds eprosartan gabapentin levamisole levetiracetam mecoprop oxcarbazepine ranitidine active bioaccumulation could not be excluded as we were not able to quantify amounts extracted from the solid phase and for levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine we also cannot rule out sorption as a removal mechanism because we could not acquire aqueous phase concentrations from the sorption controls either 3 3 4 delayed onset of biotransformation another distinct pattern that we observed involved the amine containing compounds citalopram levamisol lidocaine metoprolol pheniramine propranolol and venlafaxine in fig 2 a example concentration time series from the bt batches for this group are displayed all of these compounds showed a lag phase of about two days in the bdown community followed by a concentration decrease that could be attributed to biotransformation as described above for most of these compounds ion trapping in acidic vesicles of protozoa has been shown to be a relevant removal mechanisms in activated sludge gulde et al 2018 as we could not recover the removed amounts from the solid phase of bdown at the end of the biotransformation experiment we doubt that these compounds have been trapped as previously described but they rather were biotransformed 3 4 patterns in biotransformation rate constants for the 31 compounds that we hypothesize to mostly undergo biotransformation based on the above considerations we used the aqueous phase concentration time series of the bt batches to obtain pseudo first order degradation rate constants calculated biotransformation rate constants kbio for the investigated compounds and biofilm communities and coefficients of determination r2 of the fits are listed in table 1 since r2 describes the extent of variability in concentration between sampling points that can be explained by the factor time low r2 values coincided with low kbio values corresponding to low removal 20 30 in the respective batches we identified 13 compounds i e atenolol capecitabine cilastatin fenhexamid oxcarbazepine propachlor ranitidine sulfadiazine sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole sulfapyridine sulfathiazole trinexapac ethyl that were clearly biotransformed i e kbio values 0 055 day 1 corresponding to a 20 concentration decrease after 4 days in all four biofilm communities when comparing with information on biotransformation reactions in activated sludge it is noteworthy that most of these compounds with the exception of fenhexamid ranitidine and oxcarbazepine had been observed to undergo nucleophilic substitution type primary biotransformation reactions i e hydrolysis reactions conjugations for instance the sulfonamide antibiotics investigated here have been shown to undergo a variety of substitution reactions in cobble biofilms vila costa et al 2017 and pterin conjugations in activated sludge achermann bianco et al 2018 the primary and secondary amides atenolol and cilastatin respectively and the ester trinexapac ethyl have been found to undergo hydrolysis biotransformation reactions in activated sludge while the chloroacetanilide propachlor underwent substitution at the c cl moiety most likely through substitution by glutathione achermann falas et al 2018 the enzymes catalyzing these reactions i e dihydropteroate synthases amidohydrolases esterases glutathione s transferases are key enzymes supporting assimilation growth and defense processes and are therefore thought to be ubiquitous among different types of bacteria johnson et al 2015 this most likely explains why all of the investigated biofilms seemed to harbor the potential to biotransform these still structurally diverse mps next we looked for trends in biotransformation potential across the 31 biotransformed chemicals and the four different biofilm communities to do so we clustered the level normalized rate constants according to their relative transformation behavior across the four sites resulting in three main clusters across the investigated mps fig 3 one very distinct cluster contained the two artificial sweeteners cyclamate and saccharin the insect repellent deet the insecticide thiacloprid and the pharmaceutical levetiracetam those five compounds were all exclusively biotransformed by the hdown biofilms but remained persistent in the other communities examples shown in fig 2b this finding is consistent with results from pre experiments si section s6 where we even found exclusive biotransformation in both downstream communities hdown and bdown for those same compounds also in those pre experiments we observed a clear dissipation signal for the artificial sweetener acesulfame in the hdown community whereas in the data presented here dissipation was visible but not statistically significant a similar pattern of biotransformation being exclusively observed downstream of wwtp outfalls has recently been reported for acesulfame in sediments coll et al 2020 two possible mechanisms might explain why certain compounds are exclusively biotransformed in communities that are impacted to some extent by treated wastewater first it is feasible that the microorganisms within the downstream biofilms responded to the selective pressure from the wwtp effluent leading to changes in the community composition and function which in turn lead to the observed increased biotransformation potential alternatively wastewater bacteria capable of biotransforming these compounds may be transferred via the wwtp effluents into the downstream communities leading to the increased biotransformation potential as observed in hdown artificial sweeteners particularly acesulfame are well known to be present in high concentrations up to several µg l in downstream surface waters munz et al 2017 bergheim et al 2015 thus potentially serving the downstream biofilms as a carbon source however efficient removal of acesulfame cyclamate and saccharin in wwtps has also been shown buerge et al 2009 castronovo et al 2017 li et al 2018 suggesting that wwtp bacteria are well capable to biotransform these compounds it has already been demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance genes can be transferred from wwtps into stream biofilms marti jofre and balcazar 2013 proia et al 2016 subirats et al 2017 and it is thus also conceivable that bacteria capable to biotransform mps or their genes can be released from wwtps and manifest in downstream biofilms we also note that the phenomenon of increased biotransformation potential at downstream sites was not fully consistent across our experiments while it was observed at both downstream sites in the pre experiment it was only observed at hdown in the main experiment also one compound acesulfame only showed a clear signature in the pre experiments but not in the main experiments the variability in these observations could be due to various factors including different environmental conditions e g temperature solar irradiation or discharge or changes in operational conditions in the wwtp the operators of wwtp buttisholz confirmed that no fundamental changes in the operation of the wwtp were made between the two experimental periods hence this possibility can be ruled out further research will be needed to understand the variability of the observed downstream phenomenon and the underlying mechanisms in particular information on the biotransformation potential of the activated sludge microbial community of the respective wwtps and the load of microorganisms released by the wwtp in combination with taxonomic information e g from 16s rrna amplicon sequencing could possibly help to elucidate this phenomenon the second and largest cluster contained 18 compounds e g atenolol trinexapac ethyl rufinamide that showed generally faster biotransformation in the hochdorf communities hup and hdown compared to the buttisholz communities bup and bdown even though contamination patterns between up and downstream sites have been shown to differ munz et al 2017 no significant differences in contamination patterns were found between hochdorf and buttisholz that would explain this finding thus pre exposure to higher concentrations may not be the cause of this phenomenon however one distinguishing feature between the communities from those two sites is that bacterial cell counts at the beginning of the experiment were higher by a factor of 2 3 in the hochdorf communities compared to the buttisholz communities fig 4 higher biomass might explain the increased biotransformation potential at hochdorf to some extent considering that we have evidence from previous work with activated sludge that the transformation potential for most of these compounds is widespread among bacteria achermann falas et al 2018 it may also be the case that higher initial cell numbers lead to an overall higher bacterial diversity jaeger et al 2019 thus increasing the likelihood of rarer species to be present and adding to the biotransformation potential of the biofilms johnson et al 2015 the third cluster that we identified contained eight compounds i e dimethenamid propachlor sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sulfathiazole sulfamethazine sulfapyridine levamisol that were biotransformed fastest but not exclusively in the bdown community interestingly all five sulfonamide antibiotics and both chloroacetanilides that we investigated were found in this cluster the sulfonamide antibiotics have been previously described to follow a pterin sulfonamide conjugation pathway in activated sludge achermann bianco et al 2018 which is catalyzed by an enzyme i e dihydropteroate synthase that is part of the folate synthesis pathway as folic acid is essential for protein and nucleic acid synthesis the enzymes involved in this pathway are ubiquitous among bacteria and inherently linked to growth initial biotransformation reactions of the chloroacetanilides i e dimethenamid propachlor have been shown to mostly occur via glutathione s transferase mediated conjugations singh and singh 2016 achermann falas et al 2018 the primary role of these enzymes is detoxification and they are upregulated in response to oxidative stress from fig 4 it can be seen that bacterial numbers increased most strongly between 0 and 96 hours in the bdown community resulting in highest cell numbers at 96 hours neglecting potential differences in cell decay rates it can therefore be assumed that bacterial growth rates were highest in bdown while we do not fully understand the reasons behind the high growth rates at bdown this site has the highest native nutrient and cod contents table s3 it could thus be speculated that the bdown community was best adapted to the nutrient rich medium used in the biotransformation experiments this would potentially explain the increased biotransformation potential for the sulfonamides and chloroacetanilides for which the enzymes assumed to be responsible for their initial biotransformation reaction are known to be intimately linked to cell growth and defense against oxidative stress achermann bianco et al 2018 roland et al 1979 achermann falas et al 2018 singh and singh 2016 however to further support these conclusions additional experiments with varying amounts of initial biomass and analysis of transformation product formation would be required 3 5 environmental relevance and implications overall we presented in this study for the first time a complete mass balance procedure that can be used to study the fate of a large number of structurally diverse mps in biofilms particularly we demonstrated that the quechers extraction procedure allowed satisfactory recovery for 80 of the mps investigated this not only allows assessing the role of river biofilms in decontaminating surface waters from xenobiotic substances but also provides new evidence and opportunities to further investigate the potential use of river biofilms for effect based monitoring and as bioassay in chemical risk assessment we found that the extent of passive sorption to biofilms mostly depends on the compounds hydrophobicity and charge with a strong preference for sorption of positively charged compounds i e amine containing compounds this is qualitatively consistent with sorption to other sediment organic materials but would require more quantitative studies to e g evaluate the suitability of river biofilms as natural passive samplers writer ryan and barber 2011 this is even more so since we also observed signs of active bioaccumulation of specific substances further exploration of this phenomenon would require a more spatially and temporally resolved analysis of individual biofilm components to understand the dynamics and define compartments where the active accumulation takes place for the herbicide isoproturon specifically it would be particularly important to see whether it accumulates into the photoautotrophic members where it might exert specific toxic effects this was the first study investigating the biotransformation potential of stream biofilms involving a large number of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations we found that roughly half of the 63 compounds investigated were biotransformed to some extent by the four biofilm microbial communities however observed biotransformation reactions mostly corresponded to substitution type reactions most likely catalyzed by a limited number of enzymes that are ubiquitous among different types of bacteria because they support central metabolic processes the biotransformation rate constants of mps undergoing those transformations accordingly scaled with either bacterial biomass or biomass growth as quantified with flow cytometry more specialized transformations of a number of mps including the artificial sweeteners studied was only observed for one of the two downstream communities in this study with some evidence from pre experiments that transformation of the same compounds takes place more generally in downstream communities this suggests that the treated effluents of wastewater treatment plants tend to increase not only the pollution induced community tolerance pict of downstream biofilms as demonstrated previously tlili et al 2017 but also their biotransformation capacity for certain mps while in the case of pict and contaminant transformation these effects might be considered positive as they point towards lowered risk from chemical exposure the findings also raise the question what other biofilm functions are affected by the treated effluents and whether all of these effects can be considered positive from an ecosystem health perspective to address this ecologically highly relevant question more controlled experiments are warranted that allow differentiating the underlying mechanisms i e in stream adaptation to chemical exposure or import of biological material from wwtps and to clarify how far downstream of the wwtp the observed effects actually extend 4 conclusion in this study we collected biofilms at two field study sites and used a combination of batch experiments chemical analytical and biological methods methods to investigate the micropollutant biotransformation potential of natural stream biofilms the major conclusions of this study are the quechers extraction method proved to be a broadly applicable extraction method for a diverse set of micropollutants even for a highly complex and biologically heterogeneous matrix such as biofilm natural stream biofilms were found to possess a broad inherent micropollutant biotransformation potential i e 26 out of 59 investigated mps were biotransformed in several biofilm communities thus contributing to bioremediation and improving ecosystem health of natural surface waters through complete mass balance analysis active bioaccumulation into biofilms could be demonstrated for a number of compounds input of treated wastewater clearly changed the micropollutant biotransformation potential of downstream biofilms and hence their ecological function resulting in increased biotransformation for a number of compounds particularly artificial sweeteners declaration of competing

17162,due to regular influx of organic matter and nutrients waste stabilization ponds wsps can release considerable quantities of greenhouse gases ghgs to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of ghg emissions from wsps with a focus on the effects of sludge accumulation and distribution we conducted a bathymetry survey and two sampling campaigns in ucubamba wsp cuenca ecuador the results indicated that spatial variation of ghg emissions was strongly dependent on sludge distribution thick sludge layers in aerated ponds and facultative ponds caused substantial co2 and ch4 emissions which accounted for 21 3 and 78 7 of the total emissions from the plant conversely the prevalence of anoxic conditions stimulated the n2o consumption via complete denitrification leading to a net uptake from the atmosphere i e up to 1 4 0 2 mg n m 2 d 1 double emission rates of co2 were found in the facultative and maturation ponds during the day compared to night time emissions indicating the important role of algal respiration while no diel variation of the ch4 and n2o emissions was found despite the uptake of n2o the total ghg emissions of the wsp was higher than constructed wetlands and conventional centralized wastewater treatment facilities hence it is recommended that sludge management with proper desludging regulation should be included as an important mitigation measure to reduce the carbon footprint of pond treatment facilities keywords greenhouse gas stabilization pond carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide sludge spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsps have been globally applied for municipal wastewater treatment as they offer natural low cost and simple water purification mara 2004 in the us more than half of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are wsps ca 8 000 facilities which are also the first choice for nearly all remote communities in northern canada ho and goethals 2020 in europe wsps comprise 20 of the total number of urban wwtps in france and 33 of the wwtps in germany mara 2009 wsps are also one of the most widespread facilities for wastewater purification in new zealand with over 1 000 anaerobic ponds heubeck and craggs 2010 due to the substantial agglomeration of organic matter and nutrients wwtps have become one of the main greenhouse gas ghg sources as they were considered the sixth largest contributor to n2o emissions in 2006 daelman et al 2012 however despite the popularity of wsps only a handful of research can be found on their ghg emissions glaz et al 2016 hernandez paniagua et al 2014 park and craggs 2007 picot et al 2003 silva et al 2012 the reported ghg emissions strongly varied from one system to another that may be induced by their diverse configuration size and status as well as climatic conditions a wide range of ghg emissions from wsps was observed by hernandez paniagua et al 2014 i e 1 025 218 099 and 5 457 102 505 mg c m 2 d 1 for co2 and ch4 respectively glaz et al 2016 found that the percentage contribution of co2 was almost zero in the total emissions from wsps in western australia while this proportion was 93 8 in another pond system in quebec canada compared to numerous publications on the ghg emissions from constructed wetlands and conventional wwtps insufficient research in wsps can be attributed to the lack of scientific recognition of their global ghg contribution and significance given that small ponds can contribute 15 1 of all co2 emissions and 40 6 of all diffusive ch4 emissions from lentic freshwaters holgerson and raymond 2016 wsps can be responsible for a large amount of ghg emissions however it is considered challenging to assess the ghg contribution from wsps because of the significant spatial and temporal variability in terms of both quantity and composition of the gases as a result of an interconnected web of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic processes and reactions in wsps coggins et al 2019 as such by applying different data driven analyses in this study we examined thoroughly the spatial and temporal variations of ghg emissions from wsps and the drivers of these variations furthermore since the impacts of the sludge accumulation on the ghg emissions from wsps were suggested by glaz et al 2016 but have not yet been proved coggins et al 2019 we focused on investigating these potential impacts on pond emissions to this end we conducted two sampling campaigns and a bathymetry survey at ucubamba wwtp particularly while the first campaign focusing on the spatial variation was conducted in three locations i e inlet middle and outlet of all pond types the second 24 hour campaign was designed for evaluating the impacts of daylight and photosynthesis on the emissions from the obtained results we compared the daily ghg emission rates of the wsp with other wwtp systems furthermore by measuring both ghg emission rates and dissolved concentrations we were able to compare their correlation and patterns between and within the ponds in summary this study delivered better insights into the pathways and transformation of ghg emission rates from wsps and their important factors that are essential for developing mitigation measures of the systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wsp is located at ucubamba at an altitude of 2 423 m a s l the largest wwtp in ecuador is operated to mainly treat domestic effluent of around 400 000 inhabitants in cuenca jerves cobo et al 2020 this pond system is divided into two identical flow lines containing an aerated pond ap a facultative pond fp and a maturation pond mp fig 1 as a primary treatment the aps are used to remove organic matter and nutrients these two ponds have a depth of 4 5 m with aerators to supply enough oxygen for oxygenation but not to keep the biomass and influent materials in suspension hence organic matter can still be decomposed anaerobically at the bottom layers subsequently fps decompose further organic matter under both anaerobic and aeration conditions lastly mps polish the wastewater before being discharged into the cuenca river 2 2 field measurements two sampling campaigns were conducted in september 2018 in the first sampling campaign samples were collected from three locations within the ponds i e the input the middle and the output fig 1 samples of each pond type were collected within a day from 9 00 to 18 00 subsequently a 24 hour sampling campaign was conducted on two consecutive days one day per pond to investigate the temporal variation of the ghg emissions we sampled the middle site of fp2 and mp2 once in every two hours within 24 hours note that we focused on the diel variation of pond ghg emissions whereas the investigation of seasonal variation was out of scope of this study future research is needed to further investigate the effects of seasonality and interannual changes on the emissions from this viewpoint we kept the campaigns concise with five days in total to avoid confounding factors ruxton and colegrave 2016 besides assessing the emission rates of co2 ch4 and n2o we also gathered physical biochemical and meteorological data specifically water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity total dissolved solid tds and chlorophyll a were determined by a handheld multiprobe aquaread ap5000 version 4 07 aquaread kent england these measurements were repeated three times at every site to ensure the stability of the multiprobe and water conditions during the first sampling campaign we collected three water samples from every site while during the second sampling campaign one water sample was collected once in every two hours these water samples were then stored in cool and dark containers and then preserved in a refrigerator before being analyzed particularly ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and orthophosphate po4 3 were determined spectrophotometrically low range hach test kits with hach dr3900 frozen water samples were shipped to belgium for further analyses i e biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp data on air temperature solar radiation rainfall and wind speed were obtained from a meteorological station 2 905 79 012 located 7 8 km away from the ponds to facilitate data accessibility analysis and visualization we developed an interactive application using the r shiny package chang et al 2015 this application allows customization of the application s user interface to provide an elegant environment for displaying user input controls and simulation outputs wojciechowski et al 2015 in short the outputs can be instantaneously updated with the inputs hence the users can access analyze and visualize the collected data in a quick flexible and informative way the values of all variables in the sampling sites are available online at https water research shinyapps io ghg ucubamba wsp 2 3 bathymetry survey the distribution and accumulation of sludge were obtained from a bathymetry survey conducted in july 2018 the contours of each lagoon were surveyed by a spectra precision gps to have an accurate planimetry the ponds were separated into grids in which each section in the aps was 15m apart while an average distance was 30 m in the fps and mps the cross section for the bathymetry and the profile of sludge accumulation in each pond are shown in figures s1 1 s1 8 in supplementary material 1 the garmin echomap plus 63v sound based navigation and location technology sonar was used to measure sludge distribution and accumulation to account for two months between the bathymetry survey and the ghg sampling campaigns the increase in sludge thickness in the ponds was calculated based on the sludge accumulation rates which were obtained from the bathymetry survey table s1 3 2 4 ghg emission rates as a standard method to measure ghg emission rates tremblay et al 2011 floating chambers fcs were deployed to determine the emission rates of the co2 ch4 and n2o in this study the fcs had a volume of 9 1 l and an area of 0 04 m2 figure s2 1 the fcs consisted of a circular container made of 3 mm thick pvc plastic and covered by aluminum foil to protect the fcs from heat during the deployment period the penetration height of the fcs into the water was around six cm that was ensured by a foam ring wrapped around the fcs the fcs were kept stable on the water surface by connecting an anchor to the center of the fcs with a string a polyurethane tube was connected near to the top of the fcs the tube was used to pressure vent the fcs when placing the fcs on the water surface and was submerged after the water level reached the foam ring by doing so the penetration height of the fcs was ensured to collect gas samples we embedded a butyl rubber stopper on top of the fcs gas samples from the headspace of the fcs were collected through a butyl stopper and stored into 12 ml exetainer vials exetainer labco ltd high wycombe uk for surface flux measurements using the floating chambers three samples were collected at 0 20 and 40 minutes after placement in order to estimate the ghg emission rates from the ponds the gas samples were then shipped to eth zurich for analysis using gas chromatography gas emission rates were calculated based on the following equation emission rate slope volume of chamber area of chamber 1 the slope was calculated based on the linear regression of gas concentration in the fcs versus time the correlation coefficient r2 of the linear regression analysis was larger than 0 90 for the three ghgs except for three measurements collected in mps where the gas concentrations were relatively similar over the three time intervals details of the r2 values can be found in figure s2 2 to avoid the dilution effect as a result of the substantial accumulation of co2 and ch4 in the headspace of the fcs during the deployment period leading to underestimated values of n2o we applied a method of hupp 2011 which was used to correct water vapor in chamber measurements the details of the correction and its results can be found in supplementary material 6 2 5 dissolved gas concentrations dissolved gas concentrations c a q were measured using the headspace equilibration technique ho et al 2020 before the field campaign the 12 ml exetainer vials were pre conditioned with 50 μl of 50 zncl before capping and flushing with high purity n2 alphagaz 2 carbagas gümlingen switzerland during the field campaign three replicates of water samples were collected from approximately 10 cm below the surface in every site glaz et al 2016 of which 6 ml of water was pushed into the vials using a syringe after carefully removing air bubbles from the sample creating a headspace pressure inside the vial of c a 2 atm the headspace was analyzed for concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o using gas chromatography bruker gc 456 scion instruments livingston uk equipped with a thermal conductivity detector flame ionization detector and electron capture detector the instrument was calibrated for each gas using several sets of standards within each measurement run dissolved gas concentrations µmol l 1 were calculated by applying henry s law taking into account the vial volume and headspace c a q p a k h where k h is henry s constant adjusted for lab temperature mol m 3 pa 1 and p a is the partial pressure of the gas in the headspace pa 1 from the dissolved gas concentrations we calculated ghg emission rates by applying a model on gas exchange between air and water of liss and slater 1974 and schmidt number from wanninkhof 1992 to compare with the ghg emission rates collected in the sites note that the k600 values were estimated using an empirical function of wind speed and temperature in cole and caraco 1998 that has commonly been used for inland water systems li et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 wang et al 2017 details of the emission rate calculation can be found in supplementary material 7 2 6 random forests random forests rfs were first developed by ho 1995 and improved by breiman 2001 via using an ensemble of a large number of decision trees rfs have been largely accepted in the machine learning community since this method offers an ability to identify relevant predictor variables by means of variable importance analysis in which the effects of the predictors in predicting the response and their causal effects are measured tyralis et al 2019 in this study to identify the main important factors on spatiotemporal variations of the ghg emissions rfs were implemented in r r core team 2014 via the ranger package wright and ziegler 2017 to optimize the model we tuned two essentials hyperparameters including the minimal size of a node min node size and the number of candidate variables considered at each split mtry while the number of trees num trees as a not tunable parameter was set sufficiently high i e 500 probst et al 2019 to do so the mlr package of bischl et al 2016 was applied in parallel on eight cpu cores the tuned model with optimal hyperparameters was run to identify the importance of variables for the ghg emission rates permutation accuracy importance was preferred over the conventional variable importance since it can deal with the drawbacks of the latter e g bias towards continuous variables compared to categorical variables strobl et al 2007 2 7 combination of pca and k means clustering principal component analysis pca is a multivariate statistical method that can summarize correlation patterns among observed variables by reducing data dimensionality to a smaller number of principal components pcs the pcs are capable to explain most of the variance of the dataset and their pattern a regression equation with the observed variables can be used to unravel the nature of underlying processes tabachnick and fidell 2012 similarly clustering techniques have been commonly used in the wastewater treatment sector to understand system operations and construct diagnostic tools corominas et al 2017 k means clustering is a distance based algorithm that aims to partition observations into certain clusters by minimizing the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid hartigan and wong 1979 to determine the optimal number of clusters the elbow method was applied to test the algorithm with up to 10 clusters particularly we calculated the within cluster sum of squares wcss which measures the squared average distance of all the points within a cluster to the cluster centroid han et al 2012 in this study the data was partitioned based on ghg emissions after determining the optimal number of clusters the clusters were presented in the biplots of the most important pcs which explained the variance the most by the combination the patterns of underlying processes affecting the emissions of each cluster were recognized by the observed variables pca and k means clustering were respectively implemented via stats r core team and worldwide contributors 2002 and clusterr mouselimis et al 2019 packages in r 3 results 3 1 spatial variation of the ghg emissions to investigate the spatial variation of the ghg emissions from ucubamba wsp the first sampling campaign was conducted in all ponds fig 2 shows the boxplots of ghg emission rates from the three pond types it was found that aps and fps emitted high and variable emissions of co2 and ch4 specifically the co2 and ch4 emissions from aps were 129 2 16 1 and 7 3 0 9 g c m 2 d 1 and the emission rates from fps were 49 5 26 4 and 7 9 1 8 g c m 2 d 1 respectively releasing much lower and more stable emission rates the emissions from mps were 6 9 1 7 g c m 2 d 1 of co2 and 1 5 0 1 g c m 2 d 1 of ch4 in contrast to the substantial emissions of co2 and ch4 the three ponds acted as a sink of n2o while aps were the strongest source of co2 and ch4 aps were also the largest sink for n2o 1 4 0 2 mg n m 2 d 1 conversely less negative emission rates of n2o were found from fps and mps i e 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 0 03 mg n m 2 d 1 respectively also noteworthy is that the mean values of the emissions were closed to median values in the case of the aps and mps while the distance between the two values was much larger in the fps indicating a strong variation of ghg emissions from the fps the strong variation was induced by much higher emission rates of the ghgs from the site in the inlet of the fps compared to the other part of the ponds see fig 3 below besides fps are also more complex systems of both anoxic and aerobic processes while the other two ponds can be considered homogenous systems including either of the two processes the decrease of the emission rates from fps to mps was also indicated in the results obtained from the second campaign as the same spatial pattern was found in figure s3 1 regarding dissolved gas concentration in contrast to undersaturated ch4 and n2o observed in all the ponds dissolved co2 concentrations were much higher than their saturation levels specifically the dissolved co2 concentrations from aps fps and mps were 72 1 3 9 62 63 8 6 and 57 8 1 4 mg l 1 respectively this decreasing trend of dissolved co2 concentration along the treatment line was corresponding to the reduction of the co2 emissions from the ponds similarly the same trend was also found in the dissolved concentrations of the two other gases for example dissolved ch4 concentrations decreased from 0 39 0 09 mg l 1 to 0 16 0 05 mg l 1 and to 0 08 0 01 mg l 1 throughout the treatment lines note that dissolved n2o concentrations were insignificant in all the ponds which could attribute to their negative emission rates it appeared that ch4 emission rates decreased while n2o emission rates increased from inlet to outlet of the aps and fps no spatial pattern of co2 emission rates was found within the two pond types on the other hand the emission rates of the three ghgs appeared to be stable in the mps a similar spatial variation within a pond could be found in the dissolved gas concentrations figure s3 3 besides details of the spatial variation of the other variables can be found in figure s3 3 s3 7 and the shiny application 3 2 temporal variation of the ghg emissions to investigate the temporal variation of the ghg emissions the second sampling campaign was conducted within 24 hours in two ponds fp2 and mp2 in which the samples were collected every two hours in the middle of the ponds fig 4 shows the variation in ghg emissions from the two ponds within 24 hours it was found that the co2 emission rates dropped during the day while increasing during the night and early morning the co2 emission rates from the fp2 and mp2 were 22 9 2 9 and 12 5 1 1 g c m 2 d 1 respectively when there was no or limited sunlight i e below 90 w m 2 from 18 00 to 9 00 on the other hand high solar radiation was found during the day up to 900 w m 2 which could attribute to the low but more fluctuated co2 emissions from the two aerobic ponds i e around 9 2 5 4 and 4 7 2 6 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the difference between day and night could also be found in the values of other variables including ph do tds ec and water air temperature details of the temporal variation of these variables and the others which were measured during the second sampling campaign can be found in figures s4 1 s4 6 and the shiny application the variation of the ghg emissions from fp2 to mp2 could be found in both sampling campaigns particularly the co2 emissions were doubled in fp2 that also emitted much higher and more fluctuated ch4 and n2o emissions compared to mp2 however unlike co2 emission rates ch4 and n2o emission rates appeared to be independent on the day night cycle since these emission rates appeared with no particular patterns throughout the day the emission rates of ch4 from fp2 and mp2 were 7 9 0 7 and 3 1 1 2 g c m 2 d 1 respectively while the negative emission rates of n2o were 0 07 0 07 and 0 09 0 02 mg n m 2 d 1 compared to the first sampling campaign while the emission rates from fps observed at the second campaign remained comparable the emission rates from mp2 appeared to be higher 3 3 main important factors on spatiotemporal variation of the ghg emissions to identify the main important factors explaining the ghg emissions we applied the random forest based variable importance analysis that indicated the effect of the factors in changing the ghg emissions fig 5 shows the permutation accuracy importance of the main important factors on the spatiotemporal variation of the ghg emissions it appeared that the amount of sludge accumulated on the sites affected their emissions of all three ghgs the most sludge accumulation was the top important variable on the list of the three gases with a much higher value of variable importance compared to the variable ranking second on the list regarding the co2 emissions besides sludge accumulation nh4 concentration and do also significantly affected the variation of the co2 emissions following by no3 air temperature and solar radiation interestingly do was not one of the major driving factors on the variation of ch4 emissions from the ponds although the main processes released the ghg are anaerobic and highly sensitive with oxygen availability chen et al 2008 apart from the amount of sludge accumulation it emerged that cod and tp affected the variation of the emissions in the case of the n2o emission rates nh4 concentration and do were the most important variables next to sludge accumulation also noteworthy is that while 10 variables were having significant impacts on the variation of co2 emissions p values 0 05 this number was only six and three in the case of the ch4 and n2o emissions respectively this result suggests that a higher number of processes or factors could affect the production of co2 compared to the other two gases from the ponds in this study 3 4 combination of pca and k means clustering pca was combined with the k means clustering to reveal how the important variables affected the ghg emissions as the patterns of underlying processes affecting the emissions can be represented in regression equations whose coefficients describe the correlation between pcs and observed variables table s5 1 on the other hand based on the results of the random forest based variable importance analysis it was impractical to conclude whether the increase in sludge accumulation will boost or reduce the ghg emissions from the ponds firstly the optimal number of clusters of the pca was determined to equal to three based on the elbow method figure s5 1 these clusters were plotted in different colors while pond types and the emission rates were respectively labeled in different shapes and sizes in the biplots of pca in fig 6 by this means the driving variables of each cluster could be recognized three clusters were relatively identifiable based on the ghg emission rates and pond types the first cluster in green mainly represented the high co2 emission rates the medium ch4 emission rates and the highest negative emission rates of n2o that could be found mostly in ap in circles two sites from the fps in triangles in the first cluster were located in the inlet of the ponds that had similar ghg emissions compared to the sites in the aps the second cluster in orange mainly represented the low co2 emission rates the low ch4 emission rates and both slightly positive and negative emission rates of n2o that could be found mostly in mp in squares the third cluster in purple showed the low co2 emission rates the high medium ch4 emission rates and the slightly negative emission rates of n2o that could be found mostly in fps in triangles also noteworthy is that while cluster 1 could be partly differentiated from clusters 2 and 3 using pc2 these two clusters were overlapped in the biplots hence could not be distinguished by either pc1 or pc2 this also suggests that the variation of co2 and n2o emissions could be partially explained by pc2 while in the case of ch4 emissions a similar explanation could not be done by using only pc1 and pc2 note that pc1 revealed the variation the most 31 96 of the explained variance while pc2 described around 19 25 of the variance details of the proportion of the variance explained by each of 18 pcs can be found in table s5 1 together with their loading coefficients the loading coefficients indicate the weights of each pc to reconstruct the variables and vice versa manly and alberto 2016 hence by identifying the highest absolute values of the coefficients the most important variables on the variation of the pcs could be found the loading coefficients showed that meteorological conditions including air temperature 0 38 solar radiation 0 30 and wind speed 0 29 had a strong correlation with the pc1 together with tds 0 36 water temperature 0 33 and do 0 31 regarding the pc2 that explaining the variation of the ghg emissions sludge accumulation 0 49 cod 0 40 nh4 0 40 tp 0 38 ph 0 33 and do 0 31 were the most correlated component loadings the coefficients indicated the positive or negative correlations between these variables and the variation of co2 and ch4 emissions for example the more accumulated sludge or the lower do the higher ghg emissions also noteworthy is that the pca and k means clustering also yielded similar results of the most important variables explaining the ghg emissions compared to random forests to differentiate clusters 2 and 3 better the clusters were plotted in the biplots of pc2 and pc3 in figure s5 2 the total variance that the pc3 explained was 10 10 it appeared that pc3 could partially differentiate the clusters 2 and 3 regarding the ch4 emissions in which no2 0 56 bod5 0 54 wind speed 0 27 tn 0 27 and chlorophyll a 0 24 were the most correlated to the pc3 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation of the ghg emissions the spatial variation of the ghg emissions was strongly dependent on the distribution of the sludge accumulation as can be seen in figure s1 8 the thickness of the sludge accumulation reduced from 1 38 0 15 m in aps to 0 94 0 31 m in fps and to 0 33 0 04 m in mps which was associated with the decrease of the co2 and ch4 emissions and the increase of the n2o emissions along the treatment lines moreover within a pond the emissions from the sites were strongly associated with the respective thickness of the sludge layers at which emission rates had been measured the negligible and uniform thickness of the sludge accumulated in the mps could explain the low and stable ghg emissions throughout the ponds in contrast the excessive sludge accumulation in the inlet of the fps could attribute to much higher ghg emissions specifically the positive co2 and negative n2o emission rates from the inlet of the fps were five time higher compared to the middle and outlet of the ponds while this proportion was around 1 5 3 times for the ch4 emission rates thick sludge accumulation can be a favorite condition for ebullition emission rates due to lower hydrodrastic pressure and wave induced perturbations bastviken et al 2004 this was indicated by comparing the directly measured via floating chambers and calculated via dissolved gases ghg emission rates the directly measured emission rates were much higher in case of ch4 emissions compared to comparable magnitudes of co2 and n2o emission rates figures s7 1 and s7 2 this mismatch was therefore likely caused by not accounting for ebullition in the emission rate calculation which was the assumption of the model on gas exchange between air and water of liss and slater 1974 detweiler et al 2014 reported that 56 1 to 74 4 of the ch4 emission rates from facultative maturation ponds could be released via ebullition which could be higher in this case given the substantial accumulation of the sludge layers this correspondence indicated the strong dependence of the ch4 emissions on the sludge accumulation and distribution 4 2 temporal variation of the ghg emissions it emerged that co2 emissions were dominated by anaerobic processes due to the dominance of anaerobic conditions in the aps the largest contributor of the ghg besides the important role of algal respiration in the co2 emissions was indicated by the daily variation of the ghg in fps and mps specifically more than double emission rates of co2 were recorded in the two oxidation ponds during the day compared to the obtained co2 emission rates from 18 00 to 9 00 this result indicated the effect of the photoperiod on co2 emissions that was also observed in the pilot scale experiment of silva et al 2012 in which the nocturnal co2 emission rates were much higher than the diurnal co2 emission rates this effect was also indicated via the double amount of the co2 emission rates observed from the fps compared to the emission rates from their consecutive ponds this difference was proportional to the concentrations of chlorophyll a found in the fps and mps i e 256 4 82 1 and 87 1 17 9 mg l 1 respectively the difference between day and night could also be found in other variables such as ph do tds ec and water air temperature which were in line with the previous studies in the same system ho et al 2018a ho et al 2019 ho et al 2018b we observed no significant difference in the ch4 and n2o emissions between diurnal and nocturnal periods in fp2 and mp2 similarly insignificant temporal variation of ch4 emissions was found in silva et al 2012 the dependence on the day night cycle of co2 emissions could be attributed to the substantial impacts of sludge accumulation on the ghg productions that could marginalize the effect of nh4 do and cod theoretically nh4 and do could significantly affect the co2 and n2o emissions due to their roles in algal metabolism specifically nh4 is required for nitrification and algal metabolisms while the availability of do which is mostly supplied by algal photosynthesis in the fps and mps can significantly affect the production of n2o from nitrification and denitrification processes castro barros et al 2017 the potential n2o emissions from the metabolism of microalgae whose mechanisms are not yet fully understood plouviez et al 2019 were less likely to play an important role since the n2o emissions of the fps were lower than that in their consecutive ponds despite having triple algae biomass concentration 4 3 comparison to other wastewater treatment systems the co2 and ch4 emissions from the aps and fps in the ucubamba wsp appeared to be much higher compared to the other wsp systems craggs et al 2008 detweiler et al 2014 glaz et al 2016 hernandez paniagua et al 2014 paredes et al 2015 park and craggs 2007 silva et al 2012 stadmark and leonardson 2005 toprak 1995 in the wsps treating domestic wastewater the maximum emissions from the primary anaerobic ponds were found around 19 3 and 34 8 g c m 2 d 1 for co2 and ch4 respectively toprak 1995 and these emissions from the fps were 9 9 and 0 9 g c m 2 d 1 respectively silva et al 2012 the emissions from the ponds in this study were as high as the emissions from primary anaerobic ponds treating wastewater from piggery and dairy farms which ranged from 5 4 to 366 3 g c m 2 d 1 for co2 and from 16 4 to 44 3 g c m 2 d 1 for ch4 craggs et al 2008 park and craggs 2007 note that the ucubamba wsp is located at 2 423 m a s l the higher gas transfer velocity between air and water at high altitudes could lead to lower evasion rates compared to the wsps at low altitudes qu et al 2017 we found only glaz et al 2016 reported the n2o emissions from wsps which were also negative i e 0 06 0 19 µg n m 2 d 1 from wsps in quebec and 0 94 3 17 µg n m 2 d 1 from wsps in western australia note that no dilution effect was found supplementary material 6 which indicated that the negative n2o emission rates in this study were more likely because of the prevalence of anoxic conditions stimulating the n2o consumption via full denitrification compared to the average estimated emissions from horizontal subsurface hssf constructed wetlands cw the largest ghg emitter among different types of cws mander et al 2014 it appeared that the co2 and ch4 emissions were much higher from ucubamba wsp specifically the hssf cws released on average around 4 4 g c m 2 d 1 for co2 1 8 g c m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 58 6 mg m 2 d 1 for n2o mander et al 2014 compared to the conventional centralized wwtp in which n2o emissions contributed 78 4 of the total ghg footprint following by ch4 and co2 emissions with 13 5 and 8 1 respectively daelman et al 2013 these contributions were 0 21 3 and 78 7 in ucubamba wsp respectively unlike advanced wwtps where ch4 is recovered as a renewable energy source such ch4 collection is impractical in wsps since they are an open system requiring sunlight for algal metabolisms hence it is essential to identify hotspots of the ch4 emissions that can be revealed based on the sludge accumulation of the ponds to do so regular bathymetric surveys with high spatial resolution are needed coggins et al 2018 indicated the benefits of remotely operated vehicles rovs in increasing the resolution and accuracy of sludge bathymetry with less labor and safety requirement 4 4 model evaluation both data driven analyses indicated the effects of sludge accumulation on the ghg emissions from the ponds particularly while sludge accumulation appeared as the most important factor explaining the emissions of all three gases in random forests the results of pca and k means clustering showed that the more accumulated sludge the higher the ghg emissions note that despite its ability for whitening a black box approach of machine learning method the results of the variable importance analysis were unable to indicate how sludge accumulation affected the variation of the ghg emissions from that viewpoint we applied pca combined with the k means clustering in which the patterns between observed variables and the pcs which explain the ghg emissions were represented in regression equations in table s6 1 the clustering method was able to identify the three major clusters based on the ghg emissions which were represented in the biplots of the three most important pcs this combination has recently been applied to automate the recognition of different n2o emission pathways in wwtps by bellandi et al 2020 5 conclusion substantial spatial variation of ghg emissions within and among the ponds was strongly dependent on sludge distribution and accumulation because of thick sludge layers extensive co2 and ch4 emission rates were observed in the aerated ponds aps and the inlet of facultative ponds fps the prevalence of anoxic condition could attribute to the n2o consumption via full denitrification causing negative fluxes of n2o in the ponds double emission rates of co2 were found in the algal based ponds during the day compared to the recorded emissions during the nocturnal period indicating the important role of algal respiration in the co2 emissions no significant difference in the ch4 and n2o emissions was found between diurnal and nocturnal periods from the ponds from the comparison between the observed and calculated ghg emission rates it appeared that the ch4 ebullition rate was strongly corresponding with the thickness of sludge accumulation machine learning methods offered concrete evidence to indicate the impacts of the sludge accumulation on the ghg emissions from the wsp particularly while sludge accumulation appeared as the most important factor explaining the emissions of all three gases in random forests the results of pca and k means clustering showed that the more accumulated sludge the higher the ghg emissions while absorbing n2o ucubamba wsp released a substantial amount of co2 and ch4 which respectively contributed 21 3 and 78 7 of the total emissions due to the high emission rates of the two ghgs the total ghg emissions of the plant were higher than the average estimated emissions from constructed wetlands and conventional centralized wwtps given the strong impacts of the sludge accumulation to reduce the carbon footprint of wsps sludge management with proper desludging regulation should be the

17162,due to regular influx of organic matter and nutrients waste stabilization ponds wsps can release considerable quantities of greenhouse gases ghgs to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of ghg emissions from wsps with a focus on the effects of sludge accumulation and distribution we conducted a bathymetry survey and two sampling campaigns in ucubamba wsp cuenca ecuador the results indicated that spatial variation of ghg emissions was strongly dependent on sludge distribution thick sludge layers in aerated ponds and facultative ponds caused substantial co2 and ch4 emissions which accounted for 21 3 and 78 7 of the total emissions from the plant conversely the prevalence of anoxic conditions stimulated the n2o consumption via complete denitrification leading to a net uptake from the atmosphere i e up to 1 4 0 2 mg n m 2 d 1 double emission rates of co2 were found in the facultative and maturation ponds during the day compared to night time emissions indicating the important role of algal respiration while no diel variation of the ch4 and n2o emissions was found despite the uptake of n2o the total ghg emissions of the wsp was higher than constructed wetlands and conventional centralized wastewater treatment facilities hence it is recommended that sludge management with proper desludging regulation should be included as an important mitigation measure to reduce the carbon footprint of pond treatment facilities keywords greenhouse gas stabilization pond carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide sludge spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsps have been globally applied for municipal wastewater treatment as they offer natural low cost and simple water purification mara 2004 in the us more than half of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are wsps ca 8 000 facilities which are also the first choice for nearly all remote communities in northern canada ho and goethals 2020 in europe wsps comprise 20 of the total number of urban wwtps in france and 33 of the wwtps in germany mara 2009 wsps are also one of the most widespread facilities for wastewater purification in new zealand with over 1 000 anaerobic ponds heubeck and craggs 2010 due to the substantial agglomeration of organic matter and nutrients wwtps have become one of the main greenhouse gas ghg sources as they were considered the sixth largest contributor to n2o emissions in 2006 daelman et al 2012 however despite the popularity of wsps only a handful of research can be found on their ghg emissions glaz et al 2016 hernandez paniagua et al 2014 park and craggs 2007 picot et al 2003 silva et al 2012 the reported ghg emissions strongly varied from one system to another that may be induced by their diverse configuration size and status as well as climatic conditions a wide range of ghg emissions from wsps was observed by hernandez paniagua et al 2014 i e 1 025 218 099 and 5 457 102 505 mg c m 2 d 1 for co2 and ch4 respectively glaz et al 2016 found that the percentage contribution of co2 was almost zero in the total emissions from wsps in western australia while this proportion was 93 8 in another pond system in quebec canada compared to numerous publications on the ghg emissions from constructed wetlands and conventional wwtps insufficient research in wsps can be attributed to the lack of scientific recognition of their global ghg contribution and significance given that small ponds can contribute 15 1 of all co2 emissions and 40 6 of all diffusive ch4 emissions from lentic freshwaters holgerson and raymond 2016 wsps can be responsible for a large amount of ghg emissions however it is considered challenging to assess the ghg contribution from wsps because of the significant spatial and temporal variability in terms of both quantity and composition of the gases as a result of an interconnected web of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic processes and reactions in wsps coggins et al 2019 as such by applying different data driven analyses in this study we examined thoroughly the spatial and temporal variations of ghg emissions from wsps and the drivers of these variations furthermore since the impacts of the sludge accumulation on the ghg emissions from wsps were suggested by glaz et al 2016 but have not yet been proved coggins et al 2019 we focused on investigating these potential impacts on pond emissions to this end we conducted two sampling campaigns and a bathymetry survey at ucubamba wwtp particularly while the first campaign focusing on the spatial variation was conducted in three locations i e inlet middle and outlet of all pond types the second 24 hour campaign was designed for evaluating the impacts of daylight and photosynthesis on the emissions from the obtained results we compared the daily ghg emission rates of the wsp with other wwtp systems furthermore by measuring both ghg emission rates and dissolved concentrations we were able to compare their correlation and patterns between and within the ponds in summary this study delivered better insights into the pathways and transformation of ghg emission rates from wsps and their important factors that are essential for developing mitigation measures of the systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wsp is located at ucubamba at an altitude of 2 423 m a s l the largest wwtp in ecuador is operated to mainly treat domestic effluent of around 400 000 inhabitants in cuenca jerves cobo et al 2020 this pond system is divided into two identical flow lines containing an aerated pond ap a facultative pond fp and a maturation pond mp fig 1 as a primary treatment the aps are used to remove organic matter and nutrients these two ponds have a depth of 4 5 m with aerators to supply enough oxygen for oxygenation but not to keep the biomass and influent materials in suspension hence organic matter can still be decomposed anaerobically at the bottom layers subsequently fps decompose further organic matter under both anaerobic and aeration conditions lastly mps polish the wastewater before being discharged into the cuenca river 2 2 field measurements two sampling campaigns were conducted in september 2018 in the first sampling campaign samples were collected from three locations within the ponds i e the input the middle and the output fig 1 samples of each pond type were collected within a day from 9 00 to 18 00 subsequently a 24 hour sampling campaign was conducted on two consecutive days one day per pond to investigate the temporal variation of the ghg emissions we sampled the middle site of fp2 and mp2 once in every two hours within 24 hours note that we focused on the diel variation of pond ghg emissions whereas the investigation of seasonal variation was out of scope of this study future research is needed to further investigate the effects of seasonality and interannual changes on the emissions from this viewpoint we kept the campaigns concise with five days in total to avoid confounding factors ruxton and colegrave 2016 besides assessing the emission rates of co2 ch4 and n2o we also gathered physical biochemical and meteorological data specifically water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity total dissolved solid tds and chlorophyll a were determined by a handheld multiprobe aquaread ap5000 version 4 07 aquaread kent england these measurements were repeated three times at every site to ensure the stability of the multiprobe and water conditions during the first sampling campaign we collected three water samples from every site while during the second sampling campaign one water sample was collected once in every two hours these water samples were then stored in cool and dark containers and then preserved in a refrigerator before being analyzed particularly ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and orthophosphate po4 3 were determined spectrophotometrically low range hach test kits with hach dr3900 frozen water samples were shipped to belgium for further analyses i e biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp data on air temperature solar radiation rainfall and wind speed were obtained from a meteorological station 2 905 79 012 located 7 8 km away from the ponds to facilitate data accessibility analysis and visualization we developed an interactive application using the r shiny package chang et al 2015 this application allows customization of the application s user interface to provide an elegant environment for displaying user input controls and simulation outputs wojciechowski et al 2015 in short the outputs can be instantaneously updated with the inputs hence the users can access analyze and visualize the collected data in a quick flexible and informative way the values of all variables in the sampling sites are available online at https water research shinyapps io ghg ucubamba wsp 2 3 bathymetry survey the distribution and accumulation of sludge were obtained from a bathymetry survey conducted in july 2018 the contours of each lagoon were surveyed by a spectra precision gps to have an accurate planimetry the ponds were separated into grids in which each section in the aps was 15m apart while an average distance was 30 m in the fps and mps the cross section for the bathymetry and the profile of sludge accumulation in each pond are shown in figures s1 1 s1 8 in supplementary material 1 the garmin echomap plus 63v sound based navigation and location technology sonar was used to measure sludge distribution and accumulation to account for two months between the bathymetry survey and the ghg sampling campaigns the increase in sludge thickness in the ponds was calculated based on the sludge accumulation rates which were obtained from the bathymetry survey table s1 3 2 4 ghg emission rates as a standard method to measure ghg emission rates tremblay et al 2011 floating chambers fcs were deployed to determine the emission rates of the co2 ch4 and n2o in this study the fcs had a volume of 9 1 l and an area of 0 04 m2 figure s2 1 the fcs consisted of a circular container made of 3 mm thick pvc plastic and covered by aluminum foil to protect the fcs from heat during the deployment period the penetration height of the fcs into the water was around six cm that was ensured by a foam ring wrapped around the fcs the fcs were kept stable on the water surface by connecting an anchor to the center of the fcs with a string a polyurethane tube was connected near to the top of the fcs the tube was used to pressure vent the fcs when placing the fcs on the water surface and was submerged after the water level reached the foam ring by doing so the penetration height of the fcs was ensured to collect gas samples we embedded a butyl rubber stopper on top of the fcs gas samples from the headspace of the fcs were collected through a butyl stopper and stored into 12 ml exetainer vials exetainer labco ltd high wycombe uk for surface flux measurements using the floating chambers three samples were collected at 0 20 and 40 minutes after placement in order to estimate the ghg emission rates from the ponds the gas samples were then shipped to eth zurich for analysis using gas chromatography gas emission rates were calculated based on the following equation emission rate slope volume of chamber area of chamber 1 the slope was calculated based on the linear regression of gas concentration in the fcs versus time the correlation coefficient r2 of the linear regression analysis was larger than 0 90 for the three ghgs except for three measurements collected in mps where the gas concentrations were relatively similar over the three time intervals details of the r2 values can be found in figure s2 2 to avoid the dilution effect as a result of the substantial accumulation of co2 and ch4 in the headspace of the fcs during the deployment period leading to underestimated values of n2o we applied a method of hupp 2011 which was used to correct water vapor in chamber measurements the details of the correction and its results can be found in supplementary material 6 2 5 dissolved gas concentrations dissolved gas concentrations c a q were measured using the headspace equilibration technique ho et al 2020 before the field campaign the 12 ml exetainer vials were pre conditioned with 50 μl of 50 zncl before capping and flushing with high purity n2 alphagaz 2 carbagas gümlingen switzerland during the field campaign three replicates of water samples were collected from approximately 10 cm below the surface in every site glaz et al 2016 of which 6 ml of water was pushed into the vials using a syringe after carefully removing air bubbles from the sample creating a headspace pressure inside the vial of c a 2 atm the headspace was analyzed for concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o using gas chromatography bruker gc 456 scion instruments livingston uk equipped with a thermal conductivity detector flame ionization detector and electron capture detector the instrument was calibrated for each gas using several sets of standards within each measurement run dissolved gas concentrations µmol l 1 were calculated by applying henry s law taking into account the vial volume and headspace c a q p a k h where k h is henry s constant adjusted for lab temperature mol m 3 pa 1 and p a is the partial pressure of the gas in the headspace pa 1 from the dissolved gas concentrations we calculated ghg emission rates by applying a model on gas exchange between air and water of liss and slater 1974 and schmidt number from wanninkhof 1992 to compare with the ghg emission rates collected in the sites note that the k600 values were estimated using an empirical function of wind speed and temperature in cole and caraco 1998 that has commonly been used for inland water systems li et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 wang et al 2017 details of the emission rate calculation can be found in supplementary material 7 2 6 random forests random forests rfs were first developed by ho 1995 and improved by breiman 2001 via using an ensemble of a large number of decision trees rfs have been largely accepted in the machine learning community since this method offers an ability to identify relevant predictor variables by means of variable importance analysis in which the effects of the predictors in predicting the response and their causal effects are measured tyralis et al 2019 in this study to identify the main important factors on spatiotemporal variations of the ghg emissions rfs were implemented in r r core team 2014 via the ranger package wright and ziegler 2017 to optimize the model we tuned two essentials hyperparameters including the minimal size of a node min node size and the number of candidate variables considered at each split mtry while the number of trees num trees as a not tunable parameter was set sufficiently high i e 500 probst et al 2019 to do so the mlr package of bischl et al 2016 was applied in parallel on eight cpu cores the tuned model with optimal hyperparameters was run to identify the importance of variables for the ghg emission rates permutation accuracy importance was preferred over the conventional variable importance since it can deal with the drawbacks of the latter e g bias towards continuous variables compared to categorical variables strobl et al 2007 2 7 combination of pca and k means clustering principal component analysis pca is a multivariate statistical method that can summarize correlation patterns among observed variables by reducing data dimensionality to a smaller number of principal components pcs the pcs are capable to explain most of the variance of the dataset and their pattern a regression equation with the observed variables can be used to unravel the nature of underlying processes tabachnick and fidell 2012 similarly clustering techniques have been commonly used in the wastewater treatment sector to understand system operations and construct diagnostic tools corominas et al 2017 k means clustering is a distance based algorithm that aims to partition observations into certain clusters by minimizing the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid hartigan and wong 1979 to determine the optimal number of clusters the elbow method was applied to test the algorithm with up to 10 clusters particularly we calculated the within cluster sum of squares wcss which measures the squared average distance of all the points within a cluster to the cluster centroid han et al 2012 in this study the data was partitioned based on ghg emissions after determining the optimal number of clusters the clusters were presented in the biplots of the most important pcs which explained the variance the most by the combination the patterns of underlying processes affecting the emissions of each cluster were recognized by the observed variables pca and k means clustering were respectively implemented via stats r core team and worldwide contributors 2002 and clusterr mouselimis et al 2019 packages in r 3 results 3 1 spatial variation of the ghg emissions to investigate the spatial variation of the ghg emissions from ucubamba wsp the first sampling campaign was conducted in all ponds fig 2 shows the boxplots of ghg emission rates from the three pond types it was found that aps and fps emitted high and variable emissions of co2 and ch4 specifically the co2 and ch4 emissions from aps were 129 2 16 1 and 7 3 0 9 g c m 2 d 1 and the emission rates from fps were 49 5 26 4 and 7 9 1 8 g c m 2 d 1 respectively releasing much lower and more stable emission rates the emissions from mps were 6 9 1 7 g c m 2 d 1 of co2 and 1 5 0 1 g c m 2 d 1 of ch4 in contrast to the substantial emissions of co2 and ch4 the three ponds acted as a sink of n2o while aps were the strongest source of co2 and ch4 aps were also the largest sink for n2o 1 4 0 2 mg n m 2 d 1 conversely less negative emission rates of n2o were found from fps and mps i e 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 0 03 mg n m 2 d 1 respectively also noteworthy is that the mean values of the emissions were closed to median values in the case of the aps and mps while the distance between the two values was much larger in the fps indicating a strong variation of ghg emissions from the fps the strong variation was induced by much higher emission rates of the ghgs from the site in the inlet of the fps compared to the other part of the ponds see fig 3 below besides fps are also more complex systems of both anoxic and aerobic processes while the other two ponds can be considered homogenous systems including either of the two processes the decrease of the emission rates from fps to mps was also indicated in the results obtained from the second campaign as the same spatial pattern was found in figure s3 1 regarding dissolved gas concentration in contrast to undersaturated ch4 and n2o observed in all the ponds dissolved co2 concentrations were much higher than their saturation levels specifically the dissolved co2 concentrations from aps fps and mps were 72 1 3 9 62 63 8 6 and 57 8 1 4 mg l 1 respectively this decreasing trend of dissolved co2 concentration along the treatment line was corresponding to the reduction of the co2 emissions from the ponds similarly the same trend was also found in the dissolved concentrations of the two other gases for example dissolved ch4 concentrations decreased from 0 39 0 09 mg l 1 to 0 16 0 05 mg l 1 and to 0 08 0 01 mg l 1 throughout the treatment lines note that dissolved n2o concentrations were insignificant in all the ponds which could attribute to their negative emission rates it appeared that ch4 emission rates decreased while n2o emission rates increased from inlet to outlet of the aps and fps no spatial pattern of co2 emission rates was found within the two pond types on the other hand the emission rates of the three ghgs appeared to be stable in the mps a similar spatial variation within a pond could be found in the dissolved gas concentrations figure s3 3 besides details of the spatial variation of the other variables can be found in figure s3 3 s3 7 and the shiny application 3 2 temporal variation of the ghg emissions to investigate the temporal variation of the ghg emissions the second sampling campaign was conducted within 24 hours in two ponds fp2 and mp2 in which the samples were collected every two hours in the middle of the ponds fig 4 shows the variation in ghg emissions from the two ponds within 24 hours it was found that the co2 emission rates dropped during the day while increasing during the night and early morning the co2 emission rates from the fp2 and mp2 were 22 9 2 9 and 12 5 1 1 g c m 2 d 1 respectively when there was no or limited sunlight i e below 90 w m 2 from 18 00 to 9 00 on the other hand high solar radiation was found during the day up to 900 w m 2 which could attribute to the low but more fluctuated co2 emissions from the two aerobic ponds i e around 9 2 5 4 and 4 7 2 6 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the difference between day and night could also be found in the values of other variables including ph do tds ec and water air temperature details of the temporal variation of these variables and the others which were measured during the second sampling campaign can be found in figures s4 1 s4 6 and the shiny application the variation of the ghg emissions from fp2 to mp2 could be found in both sampling campaigns particularly the co2 emissions were doubled in fp2 that also emitted much higher and more fluctuated ch4 and n2o emissions compared to mp2 however unlike co2 emission rates ch4 and n2o emission rates appeared to be independent on the day night cycle since these emission rates appeared with no particular patterns throughout the day the emission rates of ch4 from fp2 and mp2 were 7 9 0 7 and 3 1 1 2 g c m 2 d 1 respectively while the negative emission rates of n2o were 0 07 0 07 and 0 09 0 02 mg n m 2 d 1 compared to the first sampling campaign while the emission rates from fps observed at the second campaign remained comparable the emission rates from mp2 appeared to be higher 3 3 main important factors on spatiotemporal variation of the ghg emissions to identify the main important factors explaining the ghg emissions we applied the random forest based variable importance analysis that indicated the effect of the factors in changing the ghg emissions fig 5 shows the permutation accuracy importance of the main important factors on the spatiotemporal variation of the ghg emissions it appeared that the amount of sludge accumulated on the sites affected their emissions of all three ghgs the most sludge accumulation was the top important variable on the list of the three gases with a much higher value of variable importance compared to the variable ranking second on the list regarding the co2 emissions besides sludge accumulation nh4 concentration and do also significantly affected the variation of the co2 emissions following by no3 air temperature and solar radiation interestingly do was not one of the major driving factors on the variation of ch4 emissions from the ponds although the main processes released the ghg are anaerobic and highly sensitive with oxygen availability chen et al 2008 apart from the amount of sludge accumulation it emerged that cod and tp affected the variation of the emissions in the case of the n2o emission rates nh4 concentration and do were the most important variables next to sludge accumulation also noteworthy is that while 10 variables were having significant impacts on the variation of co2 emissions p values 0 05 this number was only six and three in the case of the ch4 and n2o emissions respectively this result suggests that a higher number of processes or factors could affect the production of co2 compared to the other two gases from the ponds in this study 3 4 combination of pca and k means clustering pca was combined with the k means clustering to reveal how the important variables affected the ghg emissions as the patterns of underlying processes affecting the emissions can be represented in regression equations whose coefficients describe the correlation between pcs and observed variables table s5 1 on the other hand based on the results of the random forest based variable importance analysis it was impractical to conclude whether the increase in sludge accumulation will boost or reduce the ghg emissions from the ponds firstly the optimal number of clusters of the pca was determined to equal to three based on the elbow method figure s5 1 these clusters were plotted in different colors while pond types and the emission rates were respectively labeled in different shapes and sizes in the biplots of pca in fig 6 by this means the driving variables of each cluster could be recognized three clusters were relatively identifiable based on the ghg emission rates and pond types the first cluster in green mainly represented the high co2 emission rates the medium ch4 emission rates and the highest negative emission rates of n2o that could be found mostly in ap in circles two sites from the fps in triangles in the first cluster were located in the inlet of the ponds that had similar ghg emissions compared to the sites in the aps the second cluster in orange mainly represented the low co2 emission rates the low ch4 emission rates and both slightly positive and negative emission rates of n2o that could be found mostly in mp in squares the third cluster in purple showed the low co2 emission rates the high medium ch4 emission rates and the slightly negative emission rates of n2o that could be found mostly in fps in triangles also noteworthy is that while cluster 1 could be partly differentiated from clusters 2 and 3 using pc2 these two clusters were overlapped in the biplots hence could not be distinguished by either pc1 or pc2 this also suggests that the variation of co2 and n2o emissions could be partially explained by pc2 while in the case of ch4 emissions a similar explanation could not be done by using only pc1 and pc2 note that pc1 revealed the variation the most 31 96 of the explained variance while pc2 described around 19 25 of the variance details of the proportion of the variance explained by each of 18 pcs can be found in table s5 1 together with their loading coefficients the loading coefficients indicate the weights of each pc to reconstruct the variables and vice versa manly and alberto 2016 hence by identifying the highest absolute values of the coefficients the most important variables on the variation of the pcs could be found the loading coefficients showed that meteorological conditions including air temperature 0 38 solar radiation 0 30 and wind speed 0 29 had a strong correlation with the pc1 together with tds 0 36 water temperature 0 33 and do 0 31 regarding the pc2 that explaining the variation of the ghg emissions sludge accumulation 0 49 cod 0 40 nh4 0 40 tp 0 38 ph 0 33 and do 0 31 were the most correlated component loadings the coefficients indicated the positive or negative correlations between these variables and the variation of co2 and ch4 emissions for example the more accumulated sludge or the lower do the higher ghg emissions also noteworthy is that the pca and k means clustering also yielded similar results of the most important variables explaining the ghg emissions compared to random forests to differentiate clusters 2 and 3 better the clusters were plotted in the biplots of pc2 and pc3 in figure s5 2 the total variance that the pc3 explained was 10 10 it appeared that pc3 could partially differentiate the clusters 2 and 3 regarding the ch4 emissions in which no2 0 56 bod5 0 54 wind speed 0 27 tn 0 27 and chlorophyll a 0 24 were the most correlated to the pc3 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation of the ghg emissions the spatial variation of the ghg emissions was strongly dependent on the distribution of the sludge accumulation as can be seen in figure s1 8 the thickness of the sludge accumulation reduced from 1 38 0 15 m in aps to 0 94 0 31 m in fps and to 0 33 0 04 m in mps which was associated with the decrease of the co2 and ch4 emissions and the increase of the n2o emissions along the treatment lines moreover within a pond the emissions from the sites were strongly associated with the respective thickness of the sludge layers at which emission rates had been measured the negligible and uniform thickness of the sludge accumulated in the mps could explain the low and stable ghg emissions throughout the ponds in contrast the excessive sludge accumulation in the inlet of the fps could attribute to much higher ghg emissions specifically the positive co2 and negative n2o emission rates from the inlet of the fps were five time higher compared to the middle and outlet of the ponds while this proportion was around 1 5 3 times for the ch4 emission rates thick sludge accumulation can be a favorite condition for ebullition emission rates due to lower hydrodrastic pressure and wave induced perturbations bastviken et al 2004 this was indicated by comparing the directly measured via floating chambers and calculated via dissolved gases ghg emission rates the directly measured emission rates were much higher in case of ch4 emissions compared to comparable magnitudes of co2 and n2o emission rates figures s7 1 and s7 2 this mismatch was therefore likely caused by not accounting for ebullition in the emission rate calculation which was the assumption of the model on gas exchange between air and water of liss and slater 1974 detweiler et al 2014 reported that 56 1 to 74 4 of the ch4 emission rates from facultative maturation ponds could be released via ebullition which could be higher in this case given the substantial accumulation of the sludge layers this correspondence indicated the strong dependence of the ch4 emissions on the sludge accumulation and distribution 4 2 temporal variation of the ghg emissions it emerged that co2 emissions were dominated by anaerobic processes due to the dominance of anaerobic conditions in the aps the largest contributor of the ghg besides the important role of algal respiration in the co2 emissions was indicated by the daily variation of the ghg in fps and mps specifically more than double emission rates of co2 were recorded in the two oxidation ponds during the day compared to the obtained co2 emission rates from 18 00 to 9 00 this result indicated the effect of the photoperiod on co2 emissions that was also observed in the pilot scale experiment of silva et al 2012 in which the nocturnal co2 emission rates were much higher than the diurnal co2 emission rates this effect was also indicated via the double amount of the co2 emission rates observed from the fps compared to the emission rates from their consecutive ponds this difference was proportional to the concentrations of chlorophyll a found in the fps and mps i e 256 4 82 1 and 87 1 17 9 mg l 1 respectively the difference between day and night could also be found in other variables such as ph do tds ec and water air temperature which were in line with the previous studies in the same system ho et al 2018a ho et al 2019 ho et al 2018b we observed no significant difference in the ch4 and n2o emissions between diurnal and nocturnal periods in fp2 and mp2 similarly insignificant temporal variation of ch4 emissions was found in silva et al 2012 the dependence on the day night cycle of co2 emissions could be attributed to the substantial impacts of sludge accumulation on the ghg productions that could marginalize the effect of nh4 do and cod theoretically nh4 and do could significantly affect the co2 and n2o emissions due to their roles in algal metabolism specifically nh4 is required for nitrification and algal metabolisms while the availability of do which is mostly supplied by algal photosynthesis in the fps and mps can significantly affect the production of n2o from nitrification and denitrification processes castro barros et al 2017 the potential n2o emissions from the metabolism of microalgae whose mechanisms are not yet fully understood plouviez et al 2019 were less likely to play an important role since the n2o emissions of the fps were lower than that in their consecutive ponds despite having triple algae biomass concentration 4 3 comparison to other wastewater treatment systems the co2 and ch4 emissions from the aps and fps in the ucubamba wsp appeared to be much higher compared to the other wsp systems craggs et al 2008 detweiler et al 2014 glaz et al 2016 hernandez paniagua et al 2014 paredes et al 2015 park and craggs 2007 silva et al 2012 stadmark and leonardson 2005 toprak 1995 in the wsps treating domestic wastewater the maximum emissions from the primary anaerobic ponds were found around 19 3 and 34 8 g c m 2 d 1 for co2 and ch4 respectively toprak 1995 and these emissions from the fps were 9 9 and 0 9 g c m 2 d 1 respectively silva et al 2012 the emissions from the ponds in this study were as high as the emissions from primary anaerobic ponds treating wastewater from piggery and dairy farms which ranged from 5 4 to 366 3 g c m 2 d 1 for co2 and from 16 4 to 44 3 g c m 2 d 1 for ch4 craggs et al 2008 park and craggs 2007 note that the ucubamba wsp is located at 2 423 m a s l the higher gas transfer velocity between air and water at high altitudes could lead to lower evasion rates compared to the wsps at low altitudes qu et al 2017 we found only glaz et al 2016 reported the n2o emissions from wsps which were also negative i e 0 06 0 19 µg n m 2 d 1 from wsps in quebec and 0 94 3 17 µg n m 2 d 1 from wsps in western australia note that no dilution effect was found supplementary material 6 which indicated that the negative n2o emission rates in this study were more likely because of the prevalence of anoxic conditions stimulating the n2o consumption via full denitrification compared to the average estimated emissions from horizontal subsurface hssf constructed wetlands cw the largest ghg emitter among different types of cws mander et al 2014 it appeared that the co2 and ch4 emissions were much higher from ucubamba wsp specifically the hssf cws released on average around 4 4 g c m 2 d 1 for co2 1 8 g c m 2 d 1 for ch4 and 58 6 mg m 2 d 1 for n2o mander et al 2014 compared to the conventional centralized wwtp in which n2o emissions contributed 78 4 of the total ghg footprint following by ch4 and co2 emissions with 13 5 and 8 1 respectively daelman et al 2013 these contributions were 0 21 3 and 78 7 in ucubamba wsp respectively unlike advanced wwtps where ch4 is recovered as a renewable energy source such ch4 collection is impractical in wsps since they are an open system requiring sunlight for algal metabolisms hence it is essential to identify hotspots of the ch4 emissions that can be revealed based on the sludge accumulation of the ponds to do so regular bathymetric surveys with high spatial resolution are needed coggins et al 2018 indicated the benefits of remotely operated vehicles rovs in increasing the resolution and accuracy of sludge bathymetry with less labor and safety requirement 4 4 model evaluation both data driven analyses indicated the effects of sludge accumulation on the ghg emissions from the ponds particularly while sludge accumulation appeared as the most important factor explaining the emissions of all three gases in random forests the results of pca and k means clustering showed that the more accumulated sludge the higher the ghg emissions note that despite its ability for whitening a black box approach of machine learning method the results of the variable importance analysis were unable to indicate how sludge accumulation affected the variation of the ghg emissions from that viewpoint we applied pca combined with the k means clustering in which the patterns between observed variables and the pcs which explain the ghg emissions were represented in regression equations in table s6 1 the clustering method was able to identify the three major clusters based on the ghg emissions which were represented in the biplots of the three most important pcs this combination has recently been applied to automate the recognition of different n2o emission pathways in wwtps by bellandi et al 2020 5 conclusion substantial spatial variation of ghg emissions within and among the ponds was strongly dependent on sludge distribution and accumulation because of thick sludge layers extensive co2 and ch4 emission rates were observed in the aerated ponds aps and the inlet of facultative ponds fps the prevalence of anoxic condition could attribute to the n2o consumption via full denitrification causing negative fluxes of n2o in the ponds double emission rates of co2 were found in the algal based ponds during the day compared to the recorded emissions during the nocturnal period indicating the important role of algal respiration in the co2 emissions no significant difference in the ch4 and n2o emissions was found between diurnal and nocturnal periods from the ponds from the comparison between the observed and calculated ghg emission rates it appeared that the ch4 ebullition rate was strongly corresponding with the thickness of sludge accumulation machine learning methods offered concrete evidence to indicate the impacts of the sludge accumulation on the ghg emissions from the wsp particularly while sludge accumulation appeared as the most important factor explaining the emissions of all three gases in random forests the results of pca and k means clustering showed that the more accumulated sludge the higher the ghg emissions while absorbing n2o ucubamba wsp released a substantial amount of co2 and ch4 which respectively contributed 21 3 and 78 7 of the total emissions due to the high emission rates of the two ghgs the total ghg emissions of the plant were higher than the average estimated emissions from constructed wetlands and conventional centralized wwtps given the strong impacts of the sludge accumulation to reduce the carbon footprint of wsps sludge management with proper desludging regulation should be the

the formation of reactive manganese iron species tian et al 2019 2020 however the effect of biochar for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has not been systematically explored manganese oxides and iron oxides are non noble metal oxides with plentiful surficial active sites and fast electron transfer abilities they are widely chosen as active materials owing to the high catalytic activities and wide availability xiong et al 2019 ma et al 2005 2004 the surface of metal oxides is commonly covered by hydroxyls and the hydroxyl groups presented on the surface of mn oxides and fe oxides are usually found to have lewis acid sites which are considered as the active centers for ozone adsorption and further ozone decomposition yang et al 2009 bing et al 2015 zhao et al 2009a meanwhile manganese and

1 ozonation of atz catalyzed by different biochar samples previous study reported that atz is recalcitrant but can be oxidized through advanced oxidation processes wang et al 2019 guan et al 2013 wang et al 2018c herein 48 of atz initial content 5 μm was oxidized by 2 5 mg l of ozone within 30 min fig 1 a when biochar 20 mg l was added as catalyst ozonization efficiency of atz increased to 58 6 fig 1a in a control test 6 5 of atz was adsorbed by the biochar 20 mg l fig 1b considering that 48 of atz was oxidized by ozone and part of atz removal around 6 5 could be attributed to biochar adsorption the effect of biochar on catalyzing ozonation of atz 58 6 was not intense carbonaceous materials including biochar has been reported that they could facilitate mn vii oxidation and fe vi oxidation of organic pollutants tian et al 2019 2020 pan et al 2020 whether the resulted mn loaded biochar mnox biochar or fe loaded biochar feox biochar has ozone catalyzation capacity is intriguing effect of mnox biochar feox biochar mno2 reduction product of mn vii fe2o3 and fe3o4 reduction product of fe vi on ozone catalyzation was comparatively examined after catalyzing by the same dosage 20 mg l of mnox biochar feox biochar mno2 fe2o3 and fe3o4 removal efficiency of atz approached 83 100 65 61 and 68 within 30 min respectively fig 1a mnox biochar and feox biochar were more effective for catalyzing the ozonation of atz compared with the other catalysts mnox biochar and feox biochar have certain capacity for atz adsorption while less than 10 of atz was adsorbed by these catalysts fig 1b after reaction the spent biochar was extracted with methanol the amount of adsorbed atz in feox biochar was below detection limit while around 3 of atz was adsorbed by mnox biochar in the reaction with ozone table s1 which indicating that the disappearance of atz could be ascribed to oxidative transformation instead of adsorption by the modified biochar oxidation products would negatively impact biological and chemical stability of the treated water liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018b doc removal in relevant groups was determined given that the detection of doc would be interfered by background constituents dosage of relevant chemicals in the test was doubled i e ozone 0 5 mg l atz 0 10 μm mnox biochar 0 feox biochar 0 40 mg l reaction time 60 min doc removal ratio by biochar adsorption mnox biochar adsorption and feox biochar adsorption groups was 5 1 7 6 and 6 5 respectively fig 1c in accordance to the adsorption of atz fig 1b catalytic ozonation by mnox biochar and feox biochar enhanced the doc removal efficiency to 37 6 and 38 8 respectively over 30 higher than the inactivated ozonation group and the adsorption groups of biochar materials in comparison the doc removal efficiency in mno2 fe2o3 and fe3o4 catalytic ozonation groups was less than 10 mnox biochar and feox biochar significantly improved the ozonation of atz and the removal of doc detailed reaction mechanism would be illustrated in following sections 3 2 identification of the dominant oxidant possible oxidants in mnox biochar and feox biochar ozonation systems were analyzed to reveal the reaction mechanism reactive intermediate species including mn vi mn v mn iii fe iv and fe v may form in the mn fe catalytic ozonation reisz et al 2008 conocchioli et al 1965 in the oxidation of low valent mn fe species e g mn ii mn iii or fe ii fe iii jiang et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 and in the mn vii fe vi oxidation of biochar tian et al 2019 2020 as reported in previous study reactive intermediate mn species e g mn iii mn v and mn vi and reactive intermediate fe species e g fe iv and fe v were generated in the kmno4 biochar system and ferrate biochar system respectively to determine the role of intermediate mn fe species 5 μm of atz was respectively reacted with mn iii 100 μm mn vii biochar 100 μm 20 mg l and fe vi biochar 100 μm 20 mg l for 30 min in which less than 10 of atz was removed fig s2 according to those results we speculated that 1 ex situ prepared mn iii pyrophosphate complex was not reactive with atz 2 atz could not be removed oxidized by mn vii biochar 3 atz could not be removed oxidized by fe vi biochar intermediate mn fe species may not responsible for the degradation of atz in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation by mnox biochar or feox biochar to investigate the role of high valent intermediate mn or fe species in the mnox biochar or feox biochar catalytic ozonation system phenyl methyl sulfoxide pmso was used as a probing compound high valent mn fe species could selectively oxidize pmso to phenyl methyl sulfone pmso2 wang et al 2018b gao et al 2019 in mnox biochar or feox biochar catalytic ozonation systems pmso was readily oxidized but no formation of pmso2 was observed fig s3 this result further revealed that intermediate mn fe species may not the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of atz in mnox biochar or feox biochar catalytic ozonation processes hydroxyl radicals oh is a commonly generated oxidative species in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation and it is highly reactive with atz k oh atz 3 109 m 1s 1 tert butyl alcohol tba and bicarbonate hco3 were used as scavengers reacting with oh at rate constants of 5 9 108 m 1s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1s 1 respectively to reveal the contribution of oh on atz oxidation in ozone ozone mnox biochar ozone feox biochar groups oxidation ratio of atz was 48 84 and 100 respectively with the addition of 5 mm tba oxidation ratio of atz decreased to 23 39 and 46 respectively fig 2 a 2b and 2c hence oh may be dominant oxidant in the two heterogeneous catalytic ozonation groups it was observed that atz removal ratio in the catalytic ozonation systems was still higher than that in the pure ozonation system with the presence of excessive tba fig 2a 2b and 2c even taking the adsorption of atz into account i e 9 5 adsorbed by mnox biochar and 7 8 adsorbed by feox biochar this may be because that oh formed on the surface of catalyst still participated in the oxidation of atz given that tba predominantly scavenged free oh radicals in bulk solution but not the oh formed on the surface of catalyst wang et al 2019 guzman perez et al 2011 hco3 could react with oh with the formation of bicarbonate radicals eqs 1 and 2 buxton et al 1988 and bicarbonate radicals were less reactive than oh to react with atz k co3 atz 4 0 5 7 106 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 8 8 wojnárovits et al 2020 k oh atz 2 4 3 0 109 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 lutze et al 2015 transformation of oh into bicarbonate radical would impact the oxidation of atz removal ratio of atz in the catalytic ozonation processes decreased with the increase of hco3 concentration figs 2d and 2e as the content of hco3 increased from 1 to 5 mm removal efficiency of atz decreased from 78 2 to 61 6 in mnox biochar ozonation system and decreased from 97 8 to 77 9 in feox biochar ozonation system this inhibitory effect of hco3 on the catalytic ozonation indicated the existence of oh although the reaction rate constant of oh with hco3 k hco3 oh 8 5 106 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 9 4 buxton et al 1988 is three orders of magnitude lower than that of oh with atz the content of hco3 was significantly higher than atz hco3 0 atz 0 200 1000 μm μm given that the reaction rate m s 1 was the product of rate constant m 1s 1 and reagents concentration m reaction rate of oh with hco3 was similar to atz after calculation revealing that hco3 would consume oh competitively against atz degradation during catalytic ozonation in this study meanwhile luo et al reported that bicarbonate could significantly promote the oxidizing capacity of ferrate by stabilizing the intermediate fe v luo et al 2019 the inhibitory effect of bicarbonate in this study further ruled out the dominant role of reactive intermediate mn fe species an epr spin trapping technique was used to investigate possibly involved radicals and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as the trapping agent a typical four line signal with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 appeared in all the three ozonation systems fig 2f the 1 2 2 1 signal pattern and hyperfine coupling constant n 15 0 g h 15 0 g were characteristic of a typical dmpooh adduct furthermore intensity of dmpooh signal increased significantly with the addition of mnox biochar or feox biochar and feox biochar ozonation system exhibited stronger dmpooh signal than mnox biochar ozonation system this phenomenon is in accordance with above results that the presence of feox biochar and mnox biochar considerably enhanced the generation of oh in catalytic ozonation since oh is the dominant oxidant abatement of atz followed the order of feox biochar o3 mnox biochar o3 o3 besides oh epr analysis was used to study the possible existence of other reactive oxygen species such as o2 and 1o2 for the detection of o2 methanol solution was used as reaction matrix instead of ultrapure water to inhibit the disproportionation of o2 fig 2f showed that no epr signal of dmpoo2 adduct was detected in the single ozonation system however a weak sextet epr signal assigning to dmpoo2 adduct was observed in both mnox biochar ozonation system and feox biochar ozonation system suggesting the possible involvement of o2 o2 is an intermediate radicals of a radical chain process during ozone decomposition and oh generation eqs 3 9 it can immediately react with ozone or water to further decompose into oh eqs 9 and 10 it is reasonable to deduce that o2 formed in the catalytic ozonation processes moreover by using epr with tmp as the spin trapping agent for 1o2 no signal was obtained for both single ozonation system and catalytic ozonation systems excluding the possible involvement of 1o2 fig 2g above results showed that oh was the dominant oxidizing species responsible for the atz degradation and o2 also participated in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process 1 oh hco3 oh hco3 k 8 5 106 m 1s

ozone on catalyst and the subsequent transformation of ozone into ros are two critical steps in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation yang et al 2009 bing et al 2015 wang et al 2018a in above sections we showed that mnox biochar and feox biochar were effective for catalytic ozonation further analysis was carried out to reveal the reaction mechanism because the ozone mass transfer from aqueous solution to catalyst surface has a significant role in the catalytic ozonation effectiveness adsorption of ozone on mnox biochar and feox biochar was initially investigated amount of ozone in suspension i e solution containing catalyst and on surface of catalyst biochar was determined respectively fig 3 a and 3b in the ozonation of atz content of ozone decreased from 2 5 to 2 03 mg l within 30 min 0 47 mg l of ozone was consumed decomposed during the process during the biochar catalytic ozonation process content of ozone decreased slowly to 1 7 mg l after 30 min reaction totally 0 8 mg l of ozone being consumed decomposed the decay amount of ozone in biochar suspension only has a slight increase compared to that of ozone system without catalyst indicating a low catalytic activity of biochar in comparison concentration of ozone continuously dropped to 0 84 mg l and 0 48 mg l within 30 min in the mnox biochar suspension and feox biochar suspension respectively correspondingly up to 1 66 and 2 02 mg l of ozone consumed decomposed in the two systems respectively therefore mn oxides and fe oxides improved the capacity of biochar in activating ozone decomposition with more ros formed similar variation of ozone content on the surface of the catalysts was observed content of ozone adsorbed by raw biochar had a slightly change from 0 26 mg l at 5 min to 0 23 mg l at 30 min fig 3b however content of the ozone adsorbed by mnox biochar and feox biochar increased to 0 41 and 0 43 mg l at 5 min and then significantly decreased to 0 17 mg l and 0 08 mg l after 30 min of reaction respectively these results indicated that ozone molecule was not decomposed effectively by biochar leading to a lower reactivity while mnox biochar and feox biochar were effective for adsorbing and catalyzing ozone particularly feox biochar showed the intense ozone adsorption and decomposition efficiency resulting in the highest ros formation previous study reported that lewis acid sites were active for the adsorption of lewis bases such as ozone and they also participated in the decomposition of ozone yang et al 2009 bing et al 2015 wang et al 2019 fig 3c and 3d illustrated the ftir spectra of adsorbed pyridine pyridine ftir over different biochar catalysts at 150 and 350 c the obvious ir bands ranging from 1450 to 1600 cm 1 were assigned to pyridine adsorbed onto strong lewis acid while the band at 1490 cm 1 corresponded to pyridine adsorbed onto both lewis and bronsted acid sites the band at 1545 cm 1 was the characteristic absorption peak of pyridine onto bronsted acid sites the total and strong lewis acid sites were quantitatively estimated according to the described method table s3 emeis 1993 total lewis acid sites and medium strong lewis acid sites were 15 6 and 4 7 μmol g 1 on raw biochar 54 7 and 18 6 μmol g 1 on mnox biochar and 63 2 and 21 1 μmol g 1 on feox biochar respectively modification with mnox and feox increased the amount of lewis acid sites on biochar which may result in the significant improvement of adsorption and catalysis properties of biochar catalysts towards ozone although raw biochar could adsorb ozone fig 3b deficiency of active sites negatively influenced the decomposition of ozone and thus the formation of ros phosphate is a strong lewis base and can retard the interaction of ozone with catalyst surface resulting in the inhibition of ozone decomposition as shown in fig 3e the presence of 1 mm phosphate significantly suppressed the atz removal in catalytic ozonation although phosphate could compete with organic pollutant by trapping oh the rate constants of phosphates and oh k oh h2po4 2 104 m 1s 1 k oh hpo4 2 1 5 105 m 1s 1 are greatly lower than that of atz k oh atz 3 109 m 1s 1 to further reveal the role of surficial active sites of catalysts decomposition of adsorbed ozone on the surface of mnox biochar and feox biochar was examined in the presence of phosphate fig 3f adsorption and catalytic decomposition of ozone on mnox biochar and feox biochar surface were both depressed with the existence of phosphate phosphate with different concentration had negligible inhibitory impact on the decomposition rate of ozone in pure water yang et al 2010 lv et al 2010 the observation of phosphate decreasing ozone adsorption and decomposition on catalyst surface could be attributed to its blocking effect on the surface lewis acid sites of catalyst preventing adsorption of ozone and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species leading to a lower catalytic activity these results confirmed that surface lewis acid sites of mnox biochar and feox biochar took an important part in the catalytic ozonation 11 mn o3 h2o mn 1 oh o2 oh 12 mn 1 o3 h2o mn oh ho2 o2 multivalent transition metal oxides commonly have redox pairs such as co ii co iii fe ii fe iii and mn iii mn iv recycling of these redox couples eqs 11 and 12 is useful for the decomposition of ozone into reactive species xiong et al 2019 bing et al 2015 xia et al 2018 wang and bai 2017 xrd analysis was employed to identify crystalline phases of biochar samples loaded with transition metal oxides of this study i e mnox biochar and feox biochar as depicted in fig 4 a xrd diffraction peaks of the raw biochar were observed at 23 6 and 43 5 which corresponded to the planes of amorphous and crystalline carbons cazetta et al 2018 after doping with metal oxides intensity of amorphous and crystalline carbons on biochar decreased in mnox biochar amorphous mno2 was the major ingredient of mn oxides as the diffraction peaks at 37 6 and 65 7 could be attributed to the pattern of a typical amorphous mno2 jcpds 42 1317 without discernible fringe lattice amorphous mno2 has been reported to exhibit a superior catalytic performance owing to mixed valence abundant surface oxygen vacancies large specific surface area and high oxygen mobility yu et al 2019 ji et al 2019 for the feox biochar the characteristic diffraction peaks at 23 65 30 14 34 37 36 92 37 99 40 32 42 94 51 63 59 14 were in accordance with the crystal planes of fe2o3 jcpds 76 1821 the peaks at 2θ of 21 17 29 14 39 47 40 21 and 43 11 48 56 were consistent with the planes of fe3o4 jcpds 76 0957 thus feox biochar contained a mixed iron oxide made up with fe2o3 and fe3o4 in order to verify that mnox biochar and feox biochar catalytic ozonation systems underwent an electron transfer process cyclic voltammetry cv behaviors of biochar mnox biochar and feox biochar electrodes were analyzed in the solution containing aqueous ozone ph 7 0 fig 4b no significant redox peak was observed on the raw biochar however an obvious redox current was observed on the mnox biochar and feox biochar based on the standard reduction potentials of o3 o2 2 07 v fe ii fe iii 0 77 v and mn iii mn iv 0 95 v fe ii and mn iii can be oxidized by ozone to fe iii and mn iv respectively and fe ii is more susceptible than mn iii transformation of fe ii to fe iii and mn iii to mn iv may correlate with the decomposition of o3 fig 3a and 3b the current intensity of feox biochar was stronger than that of mnox biochar in accordance with the result of atz degradation efficiency moreover to identify the variation of valence states of mn element in mnox biochar and fe element in feox biochar xps analysis was performed on raw and spent catalysts the mn 2p spectra of mnox biochar could be deconvoluted into two components which were assigned to mn 2p3 2 and mn 2p1 2 the mn 2p3 2 peak can be divided into two peaks corresponding to mn iii 642 1 ev and mn iv 643 ev fig 4c the atomic ratio of mn iv mn iii was 1 37 by calculating with the peak area of mn 2p3 2 indicating that the fresh mnox biochar contained 57 9 mn iv and 42 1 mn iii the fe 2p spectra of feox biochar presented two peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively after deconvolution two peaks centering at binding energies of 711 4 ev and 725 2 ev correspond to the characteristic of fe iii and those at 709 9 ev and 722 9 ev were characteristic of fe ii fig 4d the shake up satellite peak at 718 2 ev suggested the presence of fe iii fe iii fe ii atomic ratio of the fresh feox biochar was 1 59 after calculation with the peak area of fe 2p implying that fe iii and fe ii accounted for 61 4 and 38 6 respectively after catalytic ozonation reaction based on the mn 2p envelop of the spent mnox biochar fig 4e and fe 2p envelop of the spent feox biochar fig 4f value of mn iv mn iii atomic ratio was 1 61 with the percentage of 61 8 mn iv and 38 2 mn iii and value of fe iii fe ii atomic ratio was 1 84 with the percentage of 64 8 fe iii and 35 2 fe ii respectively this alternation displayed the transformation of mn iii to mn iv and fe ii to fe iii by the interaction with ozone demonstrating the involvement of redox couples i e mn iv mn iii and fe iii fe ii in the catalytic ozonation process xps results further suggested that mnox and feox doped on biochar were multivalent and the interfacial electron transfer of their multiple oxidation states may accelerate the decomposition of ozone and initiate the formation of highly oxidative species xing et al 2008 lv et al 2012 bet analysis was used to study the variation of microstructure of biochar fig 5 a and 5b bet surface areas sbet of mnox biochar and feox biochar were 109 8 m2 g and 99 8 m2 g around 1 3 and 1 2 times of the raw biochar 87 4 m2 g bjh adsorption desorption cumulative pore volume of mnox biochar and feox biochar was 0 4315 0 4354 cm3 g and 0 5097 0 5137 cm3 g appropriately 1 1 and 1 2 times of raw biochar 0 4092 0 4125 cm3 g compared with raw biochar surface areas and pore volumes of micropores on mnox biochar and feox biochar were enhanced considerably micropore surface areas smic and volumes vmic of mnox biochar were 1 7 times of the raw biochar and those values of feox biochar were 1 3 times of raw biochar in addition the average pore width of mnox biochar and feox biochar was 7 54 nm and 11 66 nm respectively smaller than that of raw biochar 13 29 nm above results suggested that surface area and pore volume of biochar were improved after the reaction with mn vii and fe vi and a large amount of micropore was formed this is critical to increase the active surface and adsorption capacity of carbon materials addition of biochar enhanced the doc removal ratio by ozonation in spite of its low catalytic ability which might be due to its adsorption to transformation products with larger surface area and more micropore structures mnox biochar and feox biochar showed a better adsorption ability towards organic components 3 4 degradation pathways of atz and toxicity alteration products formed in the mnox biochar and feox biochar catalytic ozonation of atz were detected with hplc esi qqqms fig s5 profiles of the products formed in the systems are similar indicating that similar oxidants dominated in the two systems seven degradation products were identified and their abbreviations full names molecular weights molecular formula structures are summarized in table s2 based on the identified products pathways for the catalytic ozonation of atz were proposed fig 6 a the mechanism of atz degradation was involved with four pathways de alkylation alkylic hydroxylation alkylic oxidation and dechlorination hydroxylation khan et al 2014 de alkylation and alkylic hydroxylation were ascribed to the generation of carbon centered radical through h abstraction mechanism accompanying radicals attacking during de alkylation process the appearance of dissolved oxygen attacks the carbon centered radical and results in the formation of peroxy radical intermediates followed by the removal of lateral alkyl group salvestrini et al 2010 huang et al 2018 this process engages in the formation of ceat m z 174 05 and cait m z 188 07 scheme s1 in fig s6 alkylic hydroxylation is a process in which the carbon centered radical is further attacked by hydroxyl radical and this pathway explained the formation of cnit m z 232 10 along with cnht m z 248 09 scheme s2 in fig s6 khan et al 2014 the alkylic hydroxylation product cnit further underwent h abstraction by hydroxyl radical to form alkylic oxidation product cdit m z 230 08 scheme s3 in fig s6 li et al 2019 dechlorination hydroxylation is a process involved the replacement of chlorine with a hydroxyl group which followed single electron transfer mechanism instead of h abstraction during this process atz undergoes a heterolytic cleavage of ccl bond which is the easiest due to its longest bond length of 1 734 å and relatively low bond polarity of 0 293 resulting in the formation of the dechlorinated intermediate onit m z 214 13 scheme s4 in fig s6 wang et al 2018a onit could be further transformed to odit m z 212 12 via alkylic oxidation wang et al 2018a dechlorination of chlorinated organics always correlated with the abatement of their toxicity formation of cl fig 6b and toxicity alteration fig 6c of atz in different groups were comparatively investigated inhibition of luminescent intensity of p phosphoreum by 5 μm of atz was 42 in the reaction with o3 0 42 μm of cl formed within 30 min and the luminescent intensity inhibition ratio of atz decreased to 38 within 12 h around 48 of atz 5 μm was oxidized by 2 5 mg l of o3 within 30 min fig 1a but only 0 42 μm of cl was released fig 6b and less than 10 of toxicity of atz had been eliminated oxidation of atz by pure ozone did not linearly correlate with the abatement of its toxicity when mnox biochar and feox biochar were used as catalysts content of cl increased to 1 73 μm and 2 24 μm within 30 min respectively this indicated that around 35 and 45 of atz were dechlorinated similarly after 12 hour treatment luminescent intensity inhibition ratio of the atz containing water decreased to 14 6 and 6 3 respectively in the mnox biochar and feox biochar catalytic ozonization system therefore mnox biochar and feox biochar ozonation systems not only enhanced the oxidation of atz but led to the formation of more dechlorinated intermediates with the accumulation of end product cl and meanwhile reduced the toxicity of atz degradation products more effectively 3 5 reuse and metal leaching of mnox biochar and feox biochar stability and reusability of mnox biochar and feox biochar in catalytic ozonation reactions were further investigated as shown in fig 7 the recycled mnox biochar and feox biochar maintained their most catalytic performance for the first two catalyzation cycles while the subsequent reuse led to a gradual decrease of catalytic efficiency in atz ozonation in the mnox biochar catalytic ozonation system removal ratio of atz in the first and second runs were 82 9 and 78 0 respectively while it declined to 59 2 in the fourth run in the feox biochar catalytic ozonation system 100 and 96 1 of atz was degraded in the first and second runs respectively while 75 7 of atz was removed in the fourth run the inferior catalytic performance of reused mnox biochar and feox biochar may be ascribed to the accumulation of atz degradation intermediates on catalysts surface during repeated reaction cycles which hindered the interaction between active sites and ozone meanwhile formation accumulation of mn iv and fe iii after repeat catalytic ozonation may also hinder the recycle of mn iv mn iii and fe iii fe ii and thus their activity for ozone catalyzation leach of total mn and total fe species was detected after the first and the fourth runs the content of leached mn and fe was 1 8 μg l and 1 2 μg l respectively after the first catalyzation cycle after the fourth catalyzation cycle content of leached mn and fe was 1 7 μg l and 1 4 μg l respectively the amount of leached metal species from mnox biochar and feox biochar was far below the limitation of drinking water quality standard in many countries and areas who 2017 4 conclusions herein we investigated the activity potential of biochar modified with manganese oxides mnox biochar and iron oxides feox biochar for the catalytic ozonation of atz results showed that around 83 and 100 of atz was removed in the presence of mnox biochar and feox biochar respectively obviously higher than 48 1 removal ratio of single ozonation probe compound sulfoxide oxidation experiments free radicals quenching studies and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis verified that no reactive mn fe intermediate species but hydroxyl radical oh was the dominant oxidative species in the mnox biochar and feox biochar catalyzed ozonation systems the modification of mn oxides and fe oxides resulted in a significant increase of lewis acid sites on biochar surface inducing ozone decomposition to generate oh the electron transfer process through redox couples of transition metals also took an important role in the improved ozone decomposition and oh formation in addition to improving oxidation efficiency the addition of mnox biochar and feox biochar increased the doc removal ratio and dechlorination efficiency and meanwhile decreased distinctly toxicity of atz oxidation products our results indicated manganese oxides and iron oxides modified biochar have a promising potential in the improvement of ozone based advanced oxidation processes supplementary data the supplementary data including 3 texts

formation of reactive oxygen species ros and thus the degradation of refractory organic pollutants sánchez polo et al 2005 ikhlaq et al 2013 key point dominating the efficiency of heterogeneous

produce more sulfate radicals so4 to degrade polychlorinated biphenyls fang et al 2015 recent studies showed that biochar could improve oxidation capacity of permanganate and ferrate through enhancing the formation of reactive manganese iron species tian et al 2019 2020 however the effect of biochar for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has not been systematically explored manganese oxides and iron oxides are non noble metal oxides with plentiful surficial active sites and fast electron transfer abilities they are widely chosen as active materials owing to the high catalytic activities and wide availability xiong et al 2019 ma et al 2005 2004 the surface of metal oxides is commonly covered by hydroxyls and the hydroxyl groups presented on the surface of mn oxides and fe oxides are usually found to have lewis acid sites which are considered as the active centers for ozone adsorption and further ozone decomposition yang et al 2009 bing et al 2015 zhao et al 2009a meanwhile manganese and iron oxides have variable oxidation states and the recycling of those redox pairs e g fe ii fe iii mn ii mn iii mn iv enables them to generate mobile electrons thus enhancing the decomposition of ozone and the generation of reactive oxygen species by creating an electron transfer environment during catalytic ozonation qi et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 considering the excellent catalytic activity of manganese oxides and iron oxides their introduction may improve the catalytic performance of biochar in ozone decomposition and reactive species generation the main objective of this study is to provide a novel approach to activate ozone with mn oxides doped biochar mnox biochar and fe oxides doped biochar feox biochar for highly efficient degradation of organic pollutants atrazine atz as a

1 ozonation of atz catalyzed by different biochar samples previous study reported that atz is recalcitrant but can be oxidized through advanced oxidation processes wang et al 2019 guan et al 2013 wang et al 2018c herein 48 of atz initial content 5 μm was oxidized by 2 5 mg l of ozone within 30 min fig 1 a when biochar 20 mg l was added as catalyst ozonization efficiency of atz increased to 58 6 fig 1a in a control test 6 5 of atz was adsorbed by the biochar 20 mg l fig 1b considering that 48 of atz was oxidized by ozone and part of atz removal around 6 5 could be attributed to biochar adsorption the effect of biochar on catalyzing ozonation of atz 58 6 was not intense carbonaceous materials including biochar has been reported that they could facilitate mn vii oxidation and fe vi oxidation of organic pollutants tian et al 2019 2020 pan et al 2020 whether the resulted mn loaded biochar mnox biochar or fe loaded biochar feox biochar has ozone catalyzation capacity is intriguing effect of mnox biochar feox biochar mno2 reduction product of mn vii fe2o3 and fe3o4 reduction product of fe vi on ozone catalyzation was comparatively examined after catalyzing by the same dosage 20 mg l of mnox biochar feox biochar mno2 fe2o3 and fe3o4 removal efficiency of atz approached 83 100 65 61 and 68 within 30 min respectively fig 1a mnox biochar and feox biochar were more effective for catalyzing the ozonation of atz compared with the other catalysts mnox biochar and feox biochar have certain capacity for atz adsorption while less than 10 of atz was adsorbed by these catalysts fig 1b after reaction the spent biochar was extracted with methanol the amount of adsorbed atz in feox biochar was below detection limit while around 3 of atz was adsorbed by mnox biochar in the reaction with ozone table s1 which indicating that the disappearance of atz could be ascribed to oxidative transformation instead of adsorption by the modified biochar oxidation products would negatively impact biological and chemical stability of the treated water liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018b doc removal in relevant groups was determined given that the detection of doc would be interfered by background constituents dosage of relevant chemicals in the test was doubled i e ozone 0 5 mg l atz 0 10 μm mnox biochar 0 feox biochar 0 40 mg l reaction time 60 min doc removal ratio by biochar adsorption mnox biochar adsorption and feox biochar adsorption groups was 5 1 7 6 and 6 5 respectively fig 1c in accordance to the adsorption of atz fig 1b catalytic ozonation by mnox biochar and feox biochar enhanced the doc removal efficiency to 37 6 and 38 8 respectively over 30 higher than the inactivated ozonation group and the adsorption groups of biochar materials in comparison the doc removal efficiency in mno2 fe2o3 and fe3o4 catalytic ozonation groups was less than 10 mnox biochar and feox biochar significantly improved the ozonation of atz and the removal of doc detailed reaction mechanism would be illustrated in following sections 3 2 identification of the dominant oxidant possible oxidants in mnox biochar and feox biochar ozonation systems were analyzed to reveal the reaction mechanism reactive intermediate species including mn vi mn v mn iii fe iv and fe v may form in the mn fe catalytic ozonation reisz et al 2008 conocchioli et al 1965 in the oxidation of low valent mn fe species e g mn ii mn iii or fe ii fe iii jiang et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 and in the mn vii fe vi oxidation of biochar tian et al 2019 2020 as reported in previous study reactive intermediate mn species e g mn iii mn v and mn vi and reactive intermediate fe species e g fe iv and fe v were generated in the kmno4 biochar system and ferrate biochar system respectively to determine the role of intermediate mn fe species 5 μm of atz was respectively reacted with mn iii 100 μm mn vii biochar 100 μm 20 mg l and fe vi biochar 100 μm 20 mg l for 30 min in which less than 10 of atz was removed fig s2 according to those results we speculated that 1 ex situ prepared mn iii pyrophosphate complex was not reactive with atz 2 atz could not be removed oxidized by mn vii biochar 3 atz could not be removed oxidized by fe vi biochar intermediate mn fe species may not responsible for the degradation of atz in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation by mnox biochar or feox biochar to investigate the role of high valent intermediate mn or fe species in the mnox biochar or feox biochar catalytic ozonation system phenyl methyl sulfoxide pmso was used as a probing compound high valent mn fe species could selectively oxidize pmso to phenyl methyl sulfone pmso2 wang et al 2018b gao et al 2019 in mnox biochar or feox biochar catalytic ozonation systems pmso was readily oxidized but no formation of pmso2 was observed fig s3 this result further revealed that intermediate mn fe species may not the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of atz in mnox biochar or feox biochar catalytic ozonation processes hydroxyl radicals oh is a commonly generated oxidative species in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation and it is highly reactive with atz k oh atz 3 109 m 1s 1 tert butyl alcohol tba and bicarbonate hco3 were used as scavengers reacting with oh at rate constants of 5 9 108 m 1s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1s 1 respectively to reveal the contribution of oh on atz oxidation in ozone ozone mnox biochar ozone feox biochar groups oxidation ratio of atz was 48 84 and 100 respectively with the addition of 5 mm tba oxidation ratio of atz decreased to 23 39 and 46 respectively fig 2 a 2b and 2c hence oh may be dominant oxidant in the two heterogeneous catalytic ozonation groups it was observed that atz removal ratio in the catalytic ozonation systems was still higher than that in the pure ozonation system with the presence of excessive tba fig 2a 2b and 2c even taking the adsorption of atz into account i e 9 5 adsorbed by mnox biochar and 7 8 adsorbed by feox biochar this may be because that oh formed on the surface of catalyst still participated in the oxidation of atz given that tba predominantly scavenged free oh radicals in bulk solution but not the oh formed on the surface of catalyst wang et al 2019 guzman perez et al 2011 hco3 could react with oh with the formation of bicarbonate radicals eqs 1 and 2 buxton et al 1988 and bicarbonate radicals were less

radical would impact the oxidation of atz removal ratio of atz in the catalytic ozonation processes decreased with the increase of hco3 concentration figs 2d and 2e as the content of hco3 increased from 1 to 5 mm removal efficiency of atz decreased from 78 2 to 61 6 in mnox biochar ozonation system and decreased from 97 8 to 77 9 in feox biochar ozonation system this inhibitory effect of hco3 on the catalytic ozonation indicated the existence of oh although the reaction rate constant of oh with hco3 k hco3 oh 8 5 106 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 9 4 buxton et al 1988 is three orders of magnitude lower than that of oh with atz the content of hco3 was significantly higher than atz hco3 0 atz 0 200 1000 μm μm given that the reaction rate m s 1 was the product of rate constant m 1s 1 and reagents concentration m reaction rate of oh with hco3 was similar to atz after calculation revealing that hco3 would consume oh competitively against atz degradation during catalytic ozonation in this study meanwhile luo et al reported that bicarbonate could significantly promote the oxidizing capacity of ferrate by stabilizing the intermediate fe v luo et al 2019 the inhibitory effect of bicarbonate in this study further ruled out the dominant role of reactive intermediate mn fe species an epr spin trapping technique was used to investigate possibly involved radicals and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as the trapping agent a typical four line signal with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 appeared in all the three ozonation systems fig 2f the 1 2 2 1 signal pattern and hyperfine coupling constant n 15 0 g h 15 0 g were characteristic of a typical dmpooh adduct furthermore intensity of dmpooh signal increased significantly with the addition of mnox biochar or feox biochar and feox biochar ozonation system exhibited stronger dmpooh signal than mnox biochar ozonation system this phenomenon is in accordance with above results that the presence of feox biochar and mnox biochar considerably enhanced the generation of oh in catalytic ozonation since oh is the dominant oxidant abatement of atz followed the order of feox biochar o3 mnox biochar o3 o3 besides oh epr analysis was used to study the possible existence of other reactive oxygen species such as o2 and 1o2 for the detection of o2 methanol solution was used as reaction matrix instead of ultrapure water to inhibit the disproportionation of o2 fig 2f showed that no epr signal of dmpoo2 adduct was detected in the single ozonation system however a weak sextet epr signal assigning to dmpoo2 adduct was observed in both mnox biochar ozonation system and feox biochar ozonation system suggesting the possible involvement of o2 o2 is an intermediate radicals of a radical chain process during ozone decomposition and oh generation eqs 3 9 it can immediately react with ozone or water to further decompose into oh eqs 9 and 10 it is reasonable to deduce that o2 formed in the catalytic ozonation processes moreover by using epr with tmp as the spin trapping agent for 1o2 no signal was obtained for both single ozonation system and catalytic ozonation systems excluding the possible involvement of 1o2 fig 2g above results showed that oh was the dominant oxidizing species responsible for the atz degradation and o2 also participated in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process 1 oh hco3 oh hco3 k 8 5 106 m 1s

ozone on catalyst and the subsequent transformation of ozone into ros are two critical steps in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation yang et al 2009 bing et al 2015 wang et al 2018a in above sections we showed that mnox biochar and feox biochar were effective for catalytic ozonation further analysis was carried out to reveal the reaction mechanism because the ozone mass transfer from aqueous solution to catalyst surface has a significant role in the catalytic ozonation effectiveness adsorption of ozone on mnox biochar and feox biochar was initially investigated amount of ozone in suspension i e solution containing catalyst and on surface of catalyst biochar was determined respectively fig 3 a and 3b in the ozonation of atz content of ozone decreased from 2 5 to 2 03 mg l within 30 min 0 47 mg l of ozone was consumed decomposed during the process during the biochar catalytic ozonation process content of ozone decreased slowly to 1 7 mg l after 30 min reaction totally 0 8 mg l of ozone being consumed decomposed the decay amount of ozone in biochar suspension only has a slight increase compared to that of ozone system without catalyst indicating a low catalytic activity of biochar in comparison concentration of ozone continuously dropped to 0 84 mg l and 0 48 mg l within 30 min in the mnox biochar suspension and feox biochar suspension respectively correspondingly up to 1 66 and 2 02 mg l of ozone consumed decomposed in the two systems respectively therefore mn oxides and fe oxides improved the capacity of biochar in activating ozone decomposition with more ros formed similar variation of ozone content on the surface of the catalysts was observed content of ozone adsorbed by raw biochar had a slightly change from 0 26 mg l at 5 min to 0 23 mg l at 30 min fig 3b however content of the ozone adsorbed by mnox biochar and feox biochar increased to 0 41 and 0 43 mg l at 5 min and then significantly decreased to 0 17 mg l and 0 08 mg l after 30 min of reaction respectively these results indicated that ozone molecule was not decomposed effectively by biochar leading to a lower reactivity while mnox biochar and feox biochar were effective for adsorbing and catalyzing ozone particularly feox biochar showed the intense ozone adsorption and decomposition efficiency resulting in the highest ros formation previous study reported that lewis acid sites were active for the adsorption of lewis bases such as ozone and they also participated in the decomposition of ozone yang et al 2009 bing et al 2015 wang et al 2019 fig 3c and 3d illustrated the ftir spectra of adsorbed pyridine pyridine ftir over different biochar catalysts at 150 and 350 c the obvious ir bands ranging from 1450 to 1600 cm 1 were assigned to pyridine adsorbed onto strong lewis acid while the band at 1490 cm 1 corresponded to pyridine adsorbed onto both lewis and bronsted acid sites the band at 1545 cm 1 was the characteristic absorption peak of pyridine onto bronsted acid sites the total and strong lewis acid sites were quantitatively estimated according to the described method table s3 emeis 1993 total lewis acid sites and medium strong lewis acid sites were 15 6 and 4 7 μmol g 1 on raw biochar 54 7 and 18 6 μmol g 1 on mnox biochar and 63 2 and 21 1 μmol g 1 on feox biochar respectively modification with mnox and feox increased the amount of lewis acid sites on biochar which may result in the significant improvement of adsorption and catalysis properties of biochar catalysts towards ozone although raw biochar could adsorb ozone fig 3b deficiency of active sites negatively influenced the decomposition of ozone and thus the formation of ros phosphate is a strong lewis base and can retard the interaction of ozone with catalyst surface resulting in the inhibition of ozone decomposition as shown in fig 3e the presence of 1 mm phosphate significantly suppressed the atz removal in catalytic ozonation although phosphate could compete with organic pollutant by trapping oh the rate constants of phosphates and oh k oh h2po4 2 104 m 1s 1 k oh hpo4 2 1 5 105 m 1s 1 are greatly lower than that of atz k oh atz 3 109 m 1s 1 to further reveal the role of surficial active sites of catalysts decomposition of adsorbed ozone on the surface of mnox biochar and feox biochar was examined in the presence of phosphate fig 3f adsorption and catalytic decomposition of ozone on mnox biochar and feox biochar surface were both depressed with the existence of phosphate phosphate with different concentration had negligible inhibitory impact on the decomposition rate of ozone in pure water yang et al 2010 lv et al 2010 the observation of phosphate decreasing ozone adsorption and decomposition on catalyst surface could be attributed to its blocking effect on the surface lewis acid sites of catalyst preventing adsorption of ozone and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species leading to a lower catalytic activity these results confirmed that surface lewis acid sites of mnox biochar and feox biochar took an important part in the catalytic ozonation 11 mn o3 h2o mn 1 oh o2 oh 12 mn 1 o3 h2o mn oh ho2 o2 multivalent transition metal oxides commonly have redox pairs such as co ii co iii fe ii fe iii and mn iii mn iv recycling of these redox couples eqs 11 and 12 is useful for the decomposition of ozone into reactive species xiong et al 2019 bing et al 2015 xia et al 2018 wang and bai 2017 xrd analysis was employed to identify crystalline phases of biochar samples loaded with transition metal oxides of this study i e mnox biochar and feox biochar as depicted in fig 4 a xrd diffraction peaks of the raw biochar were observed at 23 6 and 43 5 which corresponded to the planes of amorphous and crystalline carbons cazetta et al 2018 after doping with metal oxides intensity of amorphous and crystalline carbons on biochar decreased in mnox biochar amorphous mno2 was the major ingredient of mn oxides as the diffraction peaks at 37 6 and 65 7 could be attributed to the pattern of a typical amorphous mno2 jcpds 42 1317 without discernible fringe lattice amorphous mno2 has been reported to exhibit a superior catalytic performance owing to mixed valence abundant surface oxygen vacancies large specific surface area and high oxygen mobility yu et al 2019 ji et al 2019 for the feox biochar the characteristic diffraction peaks at 23 65 30 14 34 37 36 92 37 99 40 32 42 94 51 63 59 14 were in accordance with the crystal planes of fe2o3 jcpds 76 1821 the peaks at 2θ of 21 17 29 14 39 47 40 21 and 43 11 48 56 were consistent with the planes of fe3o4 jcpds 76 0957 thus feox biochar contained a mixed iron oxide made up with fe2o3 and fe3o4 in order to verify that mnox biochar and feox biochar catalytic ozonation systems underwent an electron transfer process cyclic voltammetry cv behaviors of biochar mnox biochar and feox biochar electrodes were analyzed in the solution containing aqueous ozone ph 7 0 fig 4b no significant redox peak was observed on the raw biochar however an obvious redox current was observed on the mnox biochar and feox biochar based on the standard reduction potentials of o3 o2 2 07 v fe ii fe iii 0 77 v and mn iii mn iv 0 95 v fe ii and mn iii can be oxidized by ozone to fe iii and mn iv respectively and fe ii is more susceptible than mn iii transformation of fe ii to fe iii and mn iii to mn iv may correlate with the decomposition of o3 fig 3a and 3b the current intensity of feox biochar was stronger than that of mnox biochar in accordance with the result of atz degradation efficiency moreover to identify the variation of valence states of mn element in mnox biochar and fe element in feox biochar xps analysis was performed on raw and spent catalysts the mn 2p spectra of mnox biochar could be deconvoluted into two components which were assigned to mn 2p3 2 and mn 2p1 2 the mn 2p3 2 peak can be divided into two peaks corresponding to mn iii 642 1 ev and mn iv 643 ev fig 4c the atomic ratio of mn iv mn iii was 1 37 by calculating with the peak area of mn 2p3 2 indicating that the fresh mnox biochar contained 57 9 mn iv and 42 1 mn iii the fe 2p spectra of feox biochar presented two peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively after deconvolution two peaks centering at binding energies of 711 4 ev and 725 2 ev correspond to the characteristic of fe iii and those at 709 9 ev and 722 9 ev were characteristic of fe ii fig 4d the shake up satellite peak at 718 2 ev suggested the presence of fe iii fe iii fe ii atomic ratio of the fresh feox biochar was 1 59 after calculation with the peak area of fe 2p implying that fe iii and fe ii accounted for 61 4 and 38 6 respectively after catalytic ozonation reaction based on the mn 2p envelop of the spent mnox biochar fig 4e and fe 2p envelop of the spent feox biochar fig 4f value of mn iv mn iii atomic ratio was 1 61 with the percentage of 61 8 mn iv and 38 2 mn iii and value of fe iii fe ii atomic ratio was 1 84 with the percentage of 64 8 fe iii and 35 2 fe ii respectively this alternation displayed the transformation of mn iii to mn iv and fe ii to fe iii by the interaction with ozone demonstrating the involvement of redox couples i e mn iv mn iii and fe iii fe ii in the catalytic ozonation process xps results further suggested that mnox and feox doped on biochar were multivalent and the interfacial electron transfer of their multiple oxidation states may accelerate the decomposition of ozone and initiate the formation of highly oxidative species xing et al 2008 lv et al 2012 bet analysis was used to study the variation of microstructure of biochar fig 5 a and 5b bet surface areas sbet of mnox biochar and feox biochar were 109 8 m2 g and 99 8 m2 g around 1 3 and 1 2 times of the raw biochar 87 4 m2 g bjh adsorption desorption cumulative pore volume of mnox biochar and feox biochar was 0 4315 0 4354 cm3 g and 0 5097 0 5137 cm3 g appropriately 1 1 and 1 2 times of raw biochar 0 4092 0 4125 cm3 g compared with raw biochar surface areas and pore volumes of micropores on mnox biochar and feox biochar were enhanced considerably micropore surface areas smic and volumes vmic of mnox biochar were 1 7 times of the raw biochar and those values of feox biochar were 1 3 times of raw biochar in addition the average pore width of mnox biochar and feox biochar was 7 54 nm and 11 66 nm respectively smaller than that of raw biochar 13 29 nm above results suggested that surface area and pore volume of biochar were improved after the reaction with mn vii and fe vi and a large amount of micropore was formed this is critical to increase the active surface and adsorption capacity of carbon materials addition of biochar enhanced the doc removal ratio by ozonation in spite of its low catalytic ability which might be due to its adsorption to transformation products with larger surface area and more micropore structures mnox biochar and feox biochar showed a better adsorption ability towards organic components 3 4 degradation pathways of atz and toxicity alteration products formed in the mnox biochar and feox biochar catalytic ozonation of atz were detected with hplc esi qqqms fig s5 profiles of the products formed in the systems are similar indicating that similar oxidants dominated in the two systems seven degradation products were identified and their abbreviations full names molecular weights molecular formula structures are summarized in table s2 based on the identified products pathways for the catalytic ozonation of atz were proposed fig 6 a the mechanism of atz degradation was involved with four pathways de alkylation alkylic hydroxylation alkylic oxidation and dechlorination hydroxylation khan et al 2014 de alkylation and alkylic hydroxylation were ascribed to the generation of carbon centered radical through h abstraction mechanism accompanying radicals attacking during de alkylation process the appearance of dissolved oxygen attacks the carbon centered radical and results in the formation of peroxy radical intermediates followed by the removal of lateral alkyl group salvestrini et al 2010 huang et al 2018 this process engages in the formation of ceat m z 174 05 and cait m z 188 07 scheme s1 in fig s6 alkylic hydroxylation is a process in which the carbon centered radical is further attacked by hydroxyl radical and this pathway explained the formation of cnit m z 232 10 along with cnht m z 248 09 scheme s2 in fig s6 khan et al 2014 the alkylic hydroxylation product cnit further underwent h abstraction by hydroxyl radical to form alkylic oxidation product cdit m z 230 08 scheme s3 in fig s6 li et al 2019 dechlorination hydroxylation is a process involved the replacement of chlorine with a hydroxyl group which followed single electron transfer mechanism instead of h abstraction during this process atz undergoes a heterolytic cleavage of ccl bond which is the easiest due to its longest bond length of 1 734 å and relatively low bond polarity of 0 293 resulting in the formation of the dechlorinated intermediate onit m z 214 13 scheme s4 in fig s6 wang et al 2018a onit could be further transformed to odit m z 212 12 via alkylic oxidation wang et al 2018a dechlorination of chlorinated organics always correlated with the abatement of their toxicity formation of cl fig 6b and toxicity alteration fig 6c of atz in different groups were comparatively investigated inhibition of luminescent intensity of p phosphoreum by 5 μm of atz was 42 in the reaction with o3 0 42 μm of cl formed within 30 min and the luminescent intensity inhibition ratio of atz decreased to 38 within 12 h around 48 of atz 5 μm was oxidized by 2 5 mg l of o3 within 30 min fig 1a but only 0 42 μm of cl was released fig 6b and less than 10 of toxicity of atz had been eliminated oxidation of atz by pure ozone did not linearly correlate with the abatement of its toxicity when mnox biochar and feox biochar were used as catalysts content of cl increased to 1 73 μm and 2 24 μm within 30 min respectively this indicated that around 35 and 45 of atz were dechlorinated similarly after 12 hour treatment luminescent intensity inhibition ratio of the atz containing water decreased to 14 6 and 6 3 respectively in the mnox biochar and feox biochar catalytic ozonization system therefore mnox biochar and feox biochar ozonation systems not only enhanced the oxidation of atz but led to the formation of more dechlorinated intermediates with the accumulation of end product cl and meanwhile reduced the toxicity of atz degradation products more effectively 3 5 reuse and metal leaching of mnox biochar and feox biochar stability and reusability of mnox biochar and feox biochar in catalytic ozonation reactions were further investigated as shown in fig 7 the recycled mnox biochar and feox biochar maintained their most catalytic performance for the first two catalyzation cycles while the subsequent reuse led to a gradual decrease of catalytic efficiency in atz ozonation in the mnox biochar catalytic ozonation system removal ratio of atz in the first and second runs were 82 9 and 78 0 respectively while it declined to 59 2 in the fourth run in the feox biochar catalytic ozonation system 100 and 96 1 of atz was degraded in the first and second runs respectively while 75 7 of atz was removed in the fourth run the inferior catalytic performance of reused mnox biochar and feox biochar may be ascribed to the accumulation of atz degradation intermediates on catalysts surface during repeated reaction cycles which hindered the interaction between active sites and ozone meanwhile formation accumulation of mn iv and fe iii after repeat catalytic ozonation may also hinder the recycle of mn iv mn iii and fe iii fe ii and thus their activity for ozone catalyzation leach of total mn and total fe species was detected after the first and the fourth runs the content of leached mn and fe was 1 8 μg l and 1 2 μg l respectively after the first catalyzation cycle after the fourth catalyzation cycle content of leached mn and fe was 1 7 μg l and 1 4 μg l respectively the amount of leached metal species from mnox biochar and feox biochar was far below the limitation of drinking water quality standard in many countries and areas who 2017 4 conclusions herein we investigated the activity potential of biochar modified with manganese oxides mnox biochar and iron oxides feox biochar for the catalytic ozonation of atz results showed that around 83 and 100 of atz was removed in the presence of mnox biochar and feox biochar respectively obviously higher than 48 1 removal ratio of single ozonation probe compound sulfoxide oxidation experiments free radicals quenching studies and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis verified that no reactive mn fe intermediate species but hydroxyl radical oh was the dominant oxidative species in the mnox biochar and feox biochar catalyzed ozonation systems the modification of mn oxides and fe oxides resulted in a significant increase of lewis acid sites on biochar surface inducing ozone decomposition to generate oh the electron transfer process through redox couples of transition metals also took an important role in the improved ozone decomposition and oh formation in addition to improving oxidation efficiency the addition of mnox biochar and feox biochar increased the doc removal ratio and dechlorination efficiency and meanwhile decreased distinctly toxicity of atz oxidation products our results indicated manganese oxides and iron oxides modified biochar have a promising potential in the improvement of ozone based advanced oxidation processes supplementary data the supplementary data including 3 texts

17164,the potential of the formation of anammox hydroxyapatite hap granule composites as a cost effective approach to removing nitrogen and phosphorus in the treatment of wastewater has been recently reported before these annamox granules which consist of an anammox biofilm layer and an hap crystallizing layer can be used in applications the formation mechanism of hydroxyapatite hap encapsulation in the granules needs to be further studied in this work the role of extracellular polymeric substance eps secreted by microorganisms and hap core in ca and p removal in anammox hap coupled granular sludge was investigated according to the lamer model it is possible that the nucleation time of the granules becomes shorter as the crystal seeds the enhanced buffering capacity of the granules was 0 08 mmol h ss g 1 with the ph kept above 6 5 for a comfortable environment for anammox the results of this study show that ion competition and exchange mainly between cations of ca2 and mg2 and between anions of po4 3 and co3 2 affects the precipitation process the results of this study indicate that the addition of granule crystal seeds can be used as a strategy to hasten the anammox process and therefore accelerate the overall process graphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords anammox hap coupled granules biomineralization crystallization eps phosphorus recovery 1 introduction the

requires no additional carbon source and has a lower operational cost than conventional approaches ji et al 2020 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 despite these advantages however applications of the anammox process are limited the slow growth rate of anammox bacteria slow and its long doubling time at close to 14 days makes it unattractive in the marketplace van der star et al 2007 in a recent study the anammox granular sludge system was used successfully as a strategy to maintain a high concentration of anammox bacteria and to promote biomass aggregation zhang et al 2018 attributing the self immobilization process of microbes the main components of the granular sludge are anammox bacteria mineral precipitates and extracellular polymeric substances eps wang et al 2020 the bacteria cells embedded in the eps are secreted forming aggregates composed of protein polysaccharide dna and humic acids wang et al 2020 these eps can be classified into three types all with different

granules the results in the granule washouts and deterioration of stable operation especially under a high nitrogen removal rate kang et al 2020 xue et al 2020 granular sludge floatation is attributed to the low settleability of the hollow granules tan et al 2020 a number of studies have been done to demonstrate the excellent settleability of the newly fashioned annamox granules an in wastewater

demonstrated the formation of a new type of granular sludge with a double layer structure these anammox hap coupled granules have an anammox biofilm outer layer and hap crystallization in the core also phosphorus recovery via the anammox hap coupled process has been reported in both one stage and two stage partial nitritation anammox processes guo and li 2020 ma et al 2020 while the effects of the nitrogen loading rate hydraulic retention time and concentration of ca and p on anammox hap coupled process under 25 c have been reported ma et al 2020 the stability of the process for various compositions of different types of wastewaters requires further evaluation it has been reported that sludge bulking and floatation occurs in the case of granules with insufficient p concentration and that hap may function as a skeleton to maintain the granular stabilization xue et al 2020 as yet the mechanism involved in the formation of hap in anammox coupled granules is not fully understood according to classic crystallization theories the first stage in the crystallization in aqueous solutions is the nucleation stage this is followed by the crystal growth stage once the supersaturation condition is met koutsoukos et al 1980 in this study the crystallization process inside anammox granules is investigated to determine whether the mechanism is consistent with that of the classical crystallization theory biomineralization is defined as mineral crystallization controlled by the cellular or extracellular matrix of living organisms weiner and addadi 2011 it has yet to be determined whether the anammox hap coupled process can be classified as biomineralization the impact of increases in ph due to the anammox reaction on precipitation also needs to be ascertained also investigating the role of different eps is required to determine the mechanism of anammox hap coupled granule formation the overall goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms of granule formation in anammox hap coupled granules the specific objectives in our work were as follows 1 to investigate the crucial factor in formation of hap that affect anammox granules 2 to evaluate the role of eps in the performance of ca and p removal as well as the formation of hap process 3 to determine the effect of granular sludge on formation of hap coupled anammox granules 4 to evaluate the role of ph on anammox hap coupled granules 5 to determine the effect of different ions for precipitation process 6 and to clarify the adsorption and ion exchange mechanisms in the granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 the anammox hap coupled granules anammox hap coupled granules cultivated in a 5 l expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor under a constant temperature of 35 c were used in all the experiments the granules were prepared according to a procedure explained in an earlier study ma et al 2018 the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater at a constant nitrogen loading rate of 10 kg m 3 d 1 the effluent ph was between 8 0 8 5 the concentration of the volatile suspended solids vss and suspended solids ss in the sludge used in this study were 61 1 g l 1and 245 3 g l 1 respectively candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis was the dominant species of anammox bacteria in the granules identical to that reported in earlier studies chen et al 2019 ma et al 2018 2 2 experimental design a number of factors were considered in this investigation of the formation mechanism of anammox hap granules these include the granular constituents eps sludge concentration ph ion competition adsorption and ion exchange 2 2 1 granular constituents serum flasks of a1 were used as the control group fig 1 b these contained only intact granules and synthetic substrate because the synthetic substrate in the a2 flasks contained no nh4 and no2 the anammox reaction could not produce alkalinity intact granules were also added in a2 the granules in a3 were pre treated by heating at 600 c for 3 hours to remove vss and were then added to the synthetic substrate the role of the anammox reaction and the intact granules in the formation of hap in anammox coupled granules was investigated the a4 flasks were dosed with the substrate only and served as a standard for comparison purposes when considering the roles of the granules 2 2 2 eps in earlier studies on eps the important role of eps on the formation of hap coupled with an anammox biofilm has been emphasized ma et al 2020 2018 as shown in fig 2 a granules and individual eps components of s eps l eps and t eps were separately fed with the substrate to verify the effects of the granules and the eps on the formation of hap process each of the eps were collected and fed with the substrate to investigate the interactions between the substances and both the ca2 and po4 3 ions the following notations will be used hereafter to represent the different substrate configurations s l t substrate with granules that contain soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps l eps and tightly bound eps t eps l t substrate with granules that contain l eps and t eps t substrate with granules that contain t eps n substrate with granules that contain no eps s1 substrate with s eps added l1 substrate with l eps added t1 substrate with t eps added 2 2 3 sludge concentration a constant volume 100 ml of synthetic substrates was added to an increasing amount of sludge in a series of flasks to evaluate its effect on ca and p removal the sludge concentration was varied from 0 95 gss l 1 to 22 8 gss l 1 2 2 4 ph to investigate the role played by ph in formation of hap under a low ph on eliminating the effect of alkalinity brought by the anammox reaction a synthetic substrate was introduced to determine the effect of ph on hap and in precipitation synthetic substrates were added to a series of serum flasks the influent ph of these substrates was 7 6 5 4 and 3 the ph was adjusted by the addition of 0 1 mol l 1 hcl 2 2 5 ion competition the effect of different ions and the interaction between them was investigated using a variety of different substrates hereafter the following notations are used to represent different types of substrates

operation and procedures all of the 120 ml serum flasks contained 4 g of treated wet granules and 100 ml of synthetic substrate three replicates of each recipe were prepared the solutions were purged

gas produced was measured once an hour and the relationship between n2 volume and cultivation time was fitted with modified gompertz equation to calculate the specific anammox activity saa and lag

protein content according to procedure outlined in a previous report xue et al 2020 2 6 analyses of liquid samples and granules the elements ca p mg and fe in the liquid samples and granules were

neutralization capacity was determined by titration with 4g of wet sludge in 50ml of deionized water using 0 1 mol l 1 hcl under 400 rpm the ph was measured by a ph meter toa hm 30v 2 8 calculations 2 8 1 saturation index the saturation index si was used to define the saturation state in the solution in this study it was calculated by the visual miteq3 1 software using the following equation 3 si log i a p k s where iap and ks represent ionic activity and the thermodynamic solubility of the precipitated phase respectively once the si exceeds 0 the potential for the precipitate to form is assumed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of anammox granules on the hap process 3 1 1 effect of anammox reaction on the hap process no evidence of an anammox reaction was revealed in the results of the tests on the samples with no n source nh4 and no2 as shown in fig 1 the results demonstrated that granules under this condition maintained a ph of 7 8 most likely due to the buffering effect of the synthetic substrate and granules the solution ph was maintained at 8 4 in the solution with granules which underwent an anammox reaction due to alkaline supply from the reaction in contrast to the control group the effluent ca2 concentration increased to 51 7 mg l 1 close to that of p indicating that hap was not affected when there was no anammox reaction the anammox reaction did not play an important role in hap crystallization in mature anammox hap coupled granules the phenomenon of a decrease in ca removal efficiency was due to the inhibition of other ca precipitations such as caco3 comparisons between a1 and a2 fig 1c and d show that the removal efficiency dropped for ca but remained stable for p this suggests that the high si of hap which was within the range of 7 38 11 80 meant that it was unaffected by the formation of the hap process under a ph of 7 8 the si at 0 65 at a ph of 8 indicated that the residual ca continued to react with co3 2 after precipitation with p to form a small amount of caco3 in the granules therefore hap and caco3 precipitation occurred simultaneously as a result of co3 2 removal the co3 2 removal efficiency in a2 was lower than that in a1 fig s1 this can be attributed to insufficient alkalinity in a2 in the absence of the anammox reaction as can be seen from the decrease in the ph in fig 1g and the stronger impact of the ph on caco3 precipitation than hap morse et al 2007 söhnel and mullin 1982 tobler et al 2016 fe was released from the granules and fe precipitation was also found in the granules icp oes revealed that total fe content was 0 19 in dry granules of which 0 06 was fe2 0 03 was fe in heme c and 0 1 was fe of other forms fig s3 3 1 2 the hap core are a key factor for precipitation process fig 1c and d show that the sludge was essential for ca and p removal the granules were heated to 600 c to remove vss the hap core obtained was crystal seeds according to fig 1d p removal efficiency was at a high 96 1 and the effluent concentration decreased to 0 8 mg l 1 the reduced ca removal efficiency was attributed to removal suppression due to caco3 precipitation this was because the low si of caco3 at only 0 65 at a ph of 7 does not provide enough alkalinity to precipitate caco3 despite this the hap process was facilitated mg was released from the burned granules and the ph increased to 8 0 for anammox hap coupled granules the hap core was one of the factors with the strongest effect on p removal in hap this was likely due to the elimination of the organic fractions of anammox cells and eps the test results with no ca and p removal for samples without granular sludge indicated that granules play an important role in formation of hap the hap precipitation procedure maintained a stable p removal efficiency with no anammox reaction indicating that hap continued even when no alkaline was generated from the anammox reaction in intact anammox hap coupled granules the dry granules contained 17 1 of ca and 8 7 of p as shown in table 1 this is in good agreement with the xrd analysis results showing hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 fig s2 a high p removal efficiency in granules without vss is evidence that the precipitation residues served as crystal seeds to promote the occurrence of hap precipitation by reducing the activation energy lüttge 2006 although the outer layer of the granules was covered by anammox biofilms ma et al 2020 the formation of hap in anammox coupled granule was found to obey classic nucleation theory which states that small crystals act as the nuclei and the size of the nuclei will grow to form a thermodynamically stable phase fig 8a baumgartner et al 2013 the experimental results clearly indicated that the effect of the biological factors on the precipitation process was minimal also little interference was observed between the anammox and precipitation processes further implying a competitive relationship this relationship may have resulted in an unexpected precipitation process on the anammox cells to prevent the mass transfer ma et al 2020 to prevent mass transfer limitations in anammox due to the excess accumulation of precipitation the sludge concentration could be regulated during its removal 3 2 effects of eps on hap process 3 2 1 effects of granules without eps the effluent concentrations of ca in the experimental sets l t and t were higher than those in s l t 36 9 mg l 1 while the concentration in the test set without any eps was lower an increase in the removal efficiency was observed at 61 3 fig 2b and c while there was a decrease in p removal efficiency when the granules with no eps were introduced the removal efficiency decreased to 70 fig 2c and the influent and effluent ph values were around 7 5 and 8 3 respectively 3 2 2 effects of eps in different bonding status on hap the increase of ca concentration in s1 and l1 samples is shown in fig 2d this increase was attributed to the presence of ca2 in the eps extraction solutions which cannot react with s eps or l eps however the ca removal efficiency in t1 samples increased by 6 0 suggesting that only t eps could react with ca2 the study found hydroxyl groups in eps to bind with ca2 for microbial aggregation and granulation sajjad and kim 2015 compared to l eps and s eps the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins was higher in t eps as is shown in fig 2f therefore t eps exhibited a more predominant role in binding with ca the increase in the p concentration shown in fig 2e was likely due to the accumulation of extraction solutions for eps and the substrate in the tests of s1 l1 and t1 indicating that p ions cannot react with eps by themselves the ph values of the influent and effluent for all these samples were between 7 5 7 8 3 2 3 precipitation via eps induced biomineralization the results of this investigation strongly suggest that the anammox hap process is affected strongly by the hap core another important factor is extracellular matrix controlled biomineralization as has been reported in an earlier study it was shown in this study to play a role in creating the nuclei which induces precipitation weiner and addadi 2011 apart from a rise in ph caused by the anammox reaction the effects of eps on p removal in section 3 2 1 are also evidence for this assumption both ca and p removal efficiency gradually decreased when the eps was removed from the granules regardless of the strength of the binding status indicating a shortage of eps may limit the progress of hap in anammox granules it has been reported that granules with intact eps may promote ca and p removal since eps can adsorb the ions through its functional groups to create the necessary condition for precipitation obst et al 2009 when all of the eps was removed the ca removal rate increased while the p removal rate decreased this may be attributed to the exchange of ca with sodium ions when the eps was extracted by resin resulting in an insufficient amount of ca for the precipitation residues since the supply of ca was from the bulk solution for the mixtures of eps and the substrate only t eps was found to induce precipitation with a higher ca removal and no drop in the p concentration this was associated with the functional groups in t eps which are selective to ca the organic matters in eps such as polysaccharides and proteins were bridged by a multivalent cation ca2 for structural stability shi et al 2017 the experimental results for the eps samples indicated that while p is not directly affected by eps ca can react with eps and that this has a further impact on the p concentration the biomineralization induced by eps with hap core is a necessary procedure fig 8b however due to the low ca and p removal rates eps is considered a minor factor in hap formation for anammox hap granules 3 3 effects of sludge concentration on hap process 3 3 1 effect of granules as crystal seeds for hap process as shown in fig 3 a and b the ca and p removal efficiencies increased and reached equilibrium with the rise in the sludge concentration after 24 hours when the reaction time was extended to 96 hours the removal efficiencies of both ca and p under all concentrations of sludge additives gradually achieved their maximum values also fig 3 indicated that the increased sludge concentration enhanced ca and p removal and that the optimal sludge concentration for the start up of the anammox hap process is over of 6 gss l 1 according to the lamer model lamer and dinegar 1950 the increased sludge concentration shortened the reaction time of hap crystallization which is indication of its role as the crystal seeds in reducing the nucleation time 3 3 2 formation mechanism of hap for anammox granule based on lamer model during the initial stage of formation with no crystal seeds of hap inside granules biomineralization was the dominant process for crystallization the eps and cell surface in the anammox biofilms are considered to be crystal sites under a high ph and may act as the driving force for nucleation lu and leng 2005 it has been reported that eps is capable of reacting with ca2 and further engaging with p to form hap shi et al 2017 either a slow precipitation rate in the solid phase or a low removal rate in the liquid phase appeared at this stage since as suggested by the lamer model the process needs a certain length of time for nucleation which is controlled by biomineralization lamer and dinegar 1950 lin et al 2013 weiner and addadi 2011 therefore the addition of crystal seeds to the sludge could serve as a strategy to enhance nucleation once nucleation is completed the precipitation is intensified and is not controlled by biological factors the supersaturation index of hap calculated by minteq 3 1 is a positive number when the ph is higher than 6 table 2 this suggests that the operational ph for hap is in the neutral range when crystal seeds are present in the granules fig 4 therefore the ph in these granules is not a significant factor during the growth of crystal seeds biomineralization at this stage is believed to be negligible since precipitation occurs with no biological content while eps is available on the other hand without the controls of an anammox biofilm and reaction the competitive accumulation between anammox biomass and mineral precipitation in the reactor has the potential to be problematic in an earlier study it was reported that unexpected hap precipitation accumulation in the reactor restricted anammox sludge accumulation ma et al 2020 according to the findings of another study avoiding this is possible by monitoring the growth rates of anammox and precipitation xue et al 2020 3 4 effects of ph on precipitation and anammox processes 3 4 1 the role of anammox hap coupled granules to neutralize acids as shown in fig 4a the ca removal efficiency dropped along with the initial decrease in the ph from 7 0 to 3 0 reaching almost 0 at a ph of 4 0 the dissolution of ca occurred when the influent ph was 3 0 because the ca concentration in the bulk solution was higher than its initial value p could remain in its precipitated form when ca was released from caco3 eq 8 the largest factor affecting the precipitation of caco3 was ph because the si of caco3 is below 0 when ph is lower than 7 however the si of hap is still 1 537 at ph of 6 because the amount of ca released was less than the amount consumed there was an increase in the concentration of p and a decrease in the concentration of ca compared with that of initial values as shown in fig 4a the similar drop in the curve seen in fig 4e indicates the mg removal efficiency when the influent ph dropped the dissolution ph of mg precipitation was around 5 0 leentvaar and rebhun 1982 however compared with ca the consumption of mg 5 0 mg l in this study was rather low 8 2 c a c o 3 3 h 2 c a 2 h c o 3 h 2 c o 3 although the p removal efficiency also slightly declined along with lower influent ph it remained higher than 68 5 in all test samples indicating that the significance of influent ph on p removal is rather small furthermore the p removal efficiency remained at a high value of 88 7 even when the influent ph was lowered to 4 0 according to the theoretical supersaturation index calculations shown in table 2 phosphate precipitation only occurs when ph is higher than 6 however effective p removal was obtained at an influent ph of 3 this is due to the ability of the granules to adjust ph elevating the effluent ph to 7 and inducing the supersaturation condition seen in fig 4b and d although the influent ph varied from 3 0 to7 0 the anammox hap coupled granules exhibited impressive acid neutralization capacities the largest ph variation observed between the influent and effluent fluids was 4 0 after 24 h fig 4d since the effluent ph values of all samples were kept at 8 2 0 2 while the influent ph ranged from 4 0 to 7 0 it can be assumed that the anammox hap coupled granules have a high ph buffering capability in contrast to the theoretical anammox reactions eq 1 where 0 057 mol of h is necessary for the consumption of 1 mol of nh4 lotti et al 2014 a dramatic increase in ph was obtained in samples with an influent ph of below 5 exceeding the neutralization capacity of microorganisms in the anammox process 3 4 2 the specific anammox activity under low ph in previous studies a remarkable inhibition in saa at ph of 6 has been reported resulting in unstable reactor performance li et al 2017 tomaszewski et al 2017 however the fluctuation in our saa tests was negligible for influent ph values from 6 to 7 thanks to the accumulated alkaline precipitation in granules fig 4c a decrease in saa started to appear at an influent ph of 5 when the influent ph was 4 the saa was maintained at over 72 but it sharply decreased at a ph of 3 to 11 that at ph 7 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the granular buffering capability was exceeded the anammox reaction even occurred when the ph of the influent was as low as 3 due to the buffering capability of anammox granules as shown in fig 4c 3 4 3 acid neutralization capacity the acid neutralization capacity of anammox hap coupled granules is shown in fig 5 the acid neutralization capacity of the granules was 0 08 mmol h ss g 1 since the ph of over 6 5 was a comfortable environment for anammox jin et al 2012 in the even of an obvious drop in ph to 4 6 at an equivalence point an increase in hcl of 1 2 mmol h ss g 1 would have been expected fig s4 3 4 4 the effect of ph on maintaining the hap core and biomineralization in this study alkali neutralization and anammox activity deterioration were caused by the addition of acids the similar p removal efficiency under different ph values indicated that influent ph is a minor factor in the formation of hap however the alkali mineral formations are covered by biofilms in the granules which was caused by the alkalinity from the anammox reaction over a long time this implies that different compositions of alkali mineral systems could be formed in the anammox granules under a variety of biological effects and different ph conditions as a result the alkali mineral acted as a nucleus and promoted the formation of hap for the granules coupling anammox and precipitation a hypothesis for nucleation formation is that the increased ph from anammox reaction promotes p nucleation in the early stage of anammox granule formation when no precipitation has yet to take place the results suggest that ph plays a double role in the formation of hap in anammox coupled granules ph serves as a motor for nucleation in the early stage and as a nucleus stabilizer at a later stage 3 4 5 the precipitation of iron in granules it was found that fe was the abundant heme protein in anammox cells heme c is a component of a series of enzymes involved in anammox metabolic reactions for electron transfer and electron storage and is considered an indicator of anammox activity ma et al 2019 in this study although the influent fe concentration was 1mg l 1 its removal efficiency was over 60 even when the ph was lowered to 5 however the efficiency decreased significantly to 38 5 at ph 4 0 and 12 4 at 3 0 as shown in fig 4f in addition heme c was not observed in all effluent liquid samples data not shown indicating that intracellular fe did not release from cells in these tests since the amount of n2 released in all samples was the same the difference in the fe removal rates was likely due to the effect of influent ph rather than the anammox reaction hence the variations of fe concentration in the bulk solution could influence precipitation rather than being consumed in the production of relevant enzymes for proliferation in cells a large proportion of removed fe underwent precipitation eq 9 eq 10 eq 11 calculated by miteq 3 1 software as a result the effect of fe supplements a strategy to enhance activity of anammox cell was lower than expected moreover insufficient fe also led to lower anammox reaction activity when added to the solution because of competitions brought by fe precipitation and insufficient fe to synthesize relevant enzymes liu and ni 2015 9 f e 2 c o 3 2 f e c o 3 10 f e 2 o h f e o h 2 11 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o 3 5 effect of ions on hap process 3 5 1 effect of different ions on anammox hap coupled process this study explored the interaction of multifarious ions the saturation index si in table 3 estimated the tendency of precipitation with different ions compared to the ca removal efficiency of the control group 53 the ca removal efficiency was lower at 42 in the substrate without po4 3 and 32 in the substrate without co3 2 as shown in fig 6 b a higher p removal efficiency than the control group was recorded in the group with no carbonates fig 6c suggesting competition between phosphates and carbonates to precipitate with ca although ca and mg both had an effect on the p removal efficiency the contribution of ca was higher according to the results of this study as demonstrated in fig 6d mg reacted with po4 3 and co3 2 for precipitation eq 12 eq 13 calculated by miteq 3 1 software this is evident in the constant concentrations of mg in the group with no po4 3 or co3 2 also an increase in mg removal efficiency was observed when no ca2 was present even though the substrate with neither po4 3 nor co3 2 was unsaturated as indicated in table 3 its ca removal efficiency was found to be 21 likewise in the unsaturated solution without ca2 and mg2 the p removal efficiency remained over 40 therefore precipitation was not the only route for utilizing ca and p in this experiment as was reported in an early study it was possible that the following ion exchange and adsorption occurred under unsaturated condition zhou et al 2005 12 m g 2 c o 3 2 m g c o 3 13 m g 2 p o 4 3 n h 4 m g n h 4 p o 4 3 5 2 ion exchange in anammox hap coupled process the substrate was kept unsaturated to exclude the influence of precipitation when determining the ion exchange in the anammox hap coupled process in addition p and inorganic carbon ic were removed to investigate adsorption and the ion exchange of ca while in other samples ca and mg were removed to investigate adsorption and the ion exchange of p in the unsaturated solution with no potential for a precipitate to form ca and p removal was observable with both reaching an equilibrium as the substrate concentration rose as shown in fig 7 a and d simultaneously fig 7b and e showed that the dissolution of mg and ic from sludge were intensified with a higher concentration of ca and p therefore it is reasonable to conclude that ion exchange is responsible for the increase in mg and ic release eq 14 eq 15 besides the correlation between mg release and ca adsorption was linear as was that between ic release and p adsorption r2 0 9 the slopes of ion exchanges between ca and mg ions as well as between inorganic p and c were around 0 33 and 0 28 lower than the theoretical values respectively we can deduce from these results that ca and p adsorption surpassed mg and ic release indicating these ion exchanges were not equivalent also our findings suggest that the adsorption of ca and p occurred simultaneously in the granules which was potentially caused by biosorption to functional groups in eps and adsorption to the hap cores song et al 2007 14 c a 2 m g x c a x m g 2 15 2 p o 4 3 3 x c o 3 3 x p o 4 2 3 c o 3 2 3 5 3 application of anammox hap coupled process in the anammox hap process it has been reported that the settleability of granules is improved with a settling velocity of over 200 m h 1 and a specific density of over 1 25 g cm 1 ma et al 2018 xue et al 2020 high settleability has been attributed to the integration of precipitation and the anammox biofilm which also enhances the enrichment of anammox cells in the reactor ma et al 2018 leading to a high volumetric load xue et al 2020 in this work alkalinity inside the granules was found to be in the optimum range due to the abundant co3 2 precipitation inside the granules these ions are capable of controlling the ph within an optimal range for cell growth anammox sludge without this precipitation has been reported to be sensitive to tiny ph shocks causing a remarkable drop in anammox activity due to the inhibition of free nitrous acid or ammonia ma et al 2017 because the anammox hap coupled granules were more resilient in terms of tolerance of ph variations than other granules they would be well suited to applications of the anammox process in the treatment of nitrogen containing wastewaters with diverse and fluctuant ph values besides a stable p removal performance was obtained even with a considerable decrease in anammox activity and ph that is the anammox hap coupled process can be used as a simple tool for the control of both the control anammox process and hap process since the precipitation and anammox processes are considered to be relatively independent of one another for granules with precipitation the ion competition between inorganic p and c needs to be carefully monitored to mitigate its effect when applying the anammox hap process to real wastewater especially if the concentration of co3 2 is high from the results in the study a strategy to offset the effect if ion competition between inorganic p and c under high co3 2 conditions would be to decrease the ph to prevent caco3 precipitation and therefore enhance p recovery efficiency in addition the diversiform minerals in the granules could be purified by ion exchange to improve the quality of the p recovery resource the effect of ion exchange and adsorption was considerable ca and p removal under the unsaturated condition when treated with anammox hap coupled granules this ion exchange and adsorption indicates that this strategy could be adopted to ensure that stable p recovery was maintained under insufficient ca in the short term in other words ion exchange and adsorption also play important roles in ion removal and precipitation by maintaining the stability of the process 4 implications of this work the results of this study show the importance of a vital step which is the formation of necessary nucleation coupled anammox biofilms however as a rather unwanted outcome of crystallization the issue with scaling was that precipitation occurred on the inner side of the reactor walls and tubes as showed in fig s5 as has been reported in an early study this resulted in unstable operations ohtake and tsuneda 2018 for a fast start up anammox process the results of this study show that the addition of anammox hap coupled granules as sludge seeds in reactor is an effective strategy in the treatment of wastewater with low concentrations of ca and p this strategy promotes precipitation based on ion exchange and supersaturation theories furthermore it can be applied in the treatment of various kinds of wastewater 5 conclusions in this study anammox hap coupled granules were investigated to determine their formation mechanism some of the key findings are as follows chemical crystallization and biomineralization as synergy facilitate the formation of hap in anammox granules the hap core plays a key role in the formation of hap in anammox granules by providing a diversiform precipitation containing ca mg fe p and inorganic carbon in granules eps acts as a minor factor in formation of hap in anammox granules and promotes ca and p removal especially that of t eps anammox hap coupled granular sludge provides the crystal seeds for ca and p removal anammox hap coupled granules are capable of buffering ph with 0 08 mmol h ss g 1 to maintain a ph of over 6 5 for a comfortable environment for anammox competition exchange between ca and mg ions as well as between inorganic p and c and ion exchange were observed in anammox hap coupled granules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17164,the potential of the formation of anammox hydroxyapatite hap granule composites as a cost effective approach to removing nitrogen and phosphorus in the treatment of wastewater has been recently reported before these annamox granules which consist of an anammox biofilm layer and an hap crystallizing layer can be used in applications the formation mechanism of hydroxyapatite hap encapsulation in the granules needs to be further studied in this work the role of extracellular polymeric substance eps secreted by microorganisms and hap core in ca and p removal in anammox hap coupled granular sludge was investigated according to the lamer model it is possible that the nucleation time of the granules becomes shorter as the crystal seeds the enhanced buffering capacity of the granules was 0 08 mmol h ss g 1 with the ph kept above 6 5 for a comfortable environment for anammox the results of this study show that ion competition and exchange mainly between cations of ca2 and mg2 and between anions of po4 3 and co3 2 affects the precipitation process the results of this study indicate that the addition of granule crystal seeds can be used as a strategy to hasten the anammox process and

demonstrated the formation of a new type of granular sludge with a double layer structure these anammox hap coupled granules have an anammox biofilm outer layer and hap crystallization in the core also phosphorus recovery via the anammox hap coupled process has been reported in both one stage and two stage partial nitritation anammox processes guo and li 2020 ma et al 2020 while the effects of the nitrogen loading rate hydraulic retention time and concentration of ca and p on anammox hap coupled process under 25 c have been reported ma et al 2020 the stability of the process for various compositions of different types of wastewaters requires further evaluation it has been reported that sludge bulking and floatation occurs in the case of granules with insufficient p concentration and that hap may function as a skeleton to maintain the granular stabilization xue et al 2020 as yet the mechanism involved in the formation of hap in anammox coupled granules is not fully understood according to classic crystallization theories the first stage in the crystallization in aqueous solutions is the nucleation stage this is followed by the crystal growth stage once the supersaturation condition is met koutsoukos et al 1980 in this study the crystallization process inside anammox granules is investigated to determine whether the mechanism is consistent with that of the classical crystallization theory biomineralization is defined as mineral crystallization controlled by the cellular or extracellular matrix of living organisms weiner and addadi 2011 it has yet to be determined whether the anammox hap coupled process can be classified as biomineralization the impact of increases in ph due to the anammox reaction on precipitation also needs to be ascertained also investigating the role of different eps is required to determine the mechanism of anammox hap coupled granule formation the overall goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms of granule formation in anammox hap coupled granules the specific objectives in our work were as follows 1 to investigate the crucial factor in formation of hap that affect anammox granules 2 to evaluate the role of eps in the performance of ca and p removal as well as the formation of hap process 3 to determine the effect of granular sludge on formation of hap coupled anammox granules 4 to evaluate the role of ph on anammox hap coupled granules 5 to determine the effect of different ions for precipitation process 6 and to clarify the adsorption and ion exchange mechanisms in the granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 the anammox hap coupled granules anammox hap coupled granules cultivated in a 5 l expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor under a constant temperature of 35 c were used in all the experiments the granules were prepared according to a procedure explained in an earlier study ma et al 2018 the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater at a constant nitrogen loading rate of 10 kg m 3 d 1 the effluent ph was between 8 0 8 5 the concentration of the volatile suspended solids vss and suspended solids ss in the sludge used in this study were 61 1 g l 1and 245 3 g l 1 respectively candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis was the dominant species of anammox bacteria in the granules identical to that reported in earlier studies chen et al 2019 ma et al 2018 2 2 experimental design a number of factors were considered in this investigation of the formation mechanism of anammox hap granules these include the granular constituents eps sludge concentration ph ion competition adsorption and ion exchange 2 2 1 granular constituents serum flasks of a1 were used as the control group fig 1 b these contained only intact granules and synthetic substrate because the synthetic substrate in the a2 flasks contained no nh4 and no2 the anammox reaction could not produce alkalinity intact granules were also added in a2 the granules in a3 were pre treated by heating at 600 c for 3 hours to remove vss and were then added to the synthetic substrate the role of the anammox reaction and the intact granules in the formation of hap in anammox coupled granules was investigated the a4 flasks were dosed with the substrate only and served as a standard for comparison purposes when considering the roles of the granules 2 2 2 eps in earlier studies on eps the important role of eps on the formation of hap coupled with an anammox biofilm has been emphasized ma et al 2020 2018 as shown in fig 2 a granules and individual eps components of s eps l eps and t eps were separately fed with the substrate to verify the effects of the granules and the eps on the formation of hap process each of the eps were collected and fed with the substrate to investigate the interactions between the substances and both the ca2 and po4 3 ions the following notations will be used hereafter to represent the different substrate configurations s l t substrate with granules that contain soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps l eps and tightly bound eps t eps l t substrate with granules that contain l eps and t eps t substrate with granules that contain t eps n substrate with granules that contain no eps s1 substrate with s eps added l1 substrate with l eps added t1 substrate with t eps added 2 2 3 sludge concentration a constant volume 100 ml of synthetic substrates was added to an increasing amount of sludge in a series of flasks to evaluate its effect on ca and p removal the sludge concentration was varied from 0 95 gss l 1 to 22 8 gss l 1 2 2 4 ph to investigate the role played by ph in formation of hap under a low ph on eliminating the effect of alkalinity brought by the anammox reaction a synthetic substrate was introduced to determine the effect of ph on hap and in precipitation synthetic substrates were added to a series of serum flasks the influent ph of these substrates was 7 6 5 4 and 3 the ph was adjusted by the addition of 0 1 mol l 1 hcl 2 2 5 ion competition the effect of different ions and the interaction between them was investigated using a variety of different substrates hereafter the following notations are used to represent different types of substrates fig 6a b1 intact synthetic substrate also the control group b2 synthetic substrate with no ca b3 synthetic substrate with no p b4 synthetic substrate with no inorganic carbon b5 synthetic substrate with no ca and p b6 synthetic substrate without inorganic carbon and p b7 synthetic substrate with no ca and mg 2 2 6 adsorption and ion exchange all experimental substrates were kept in an unsaturated condition si 0 details in section 2 8 1 to ensure precipitation did not take place in the first part of the experiments solutions with initial ca concentrations from 0 to 400 mg l 1 with no po4 3 or co3 2 were introduced into the flasks in the second part p was added to the solution with initial concentrations from 0 to 250 mg l 1 with the ca and mg ions removed 2 3 experimental operation and procedures all of the 120 ml serum flasks contained 4 g of treated wet granules and 100 ml of synthetic substrate three replicates of each recipe were prepared the solutions were purged by n2 with a purity of 99 9 for 20 min after which the flasks were immediately sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap the air in the headspace of the sealed flasks was removed by another n2 purge for 10 min to obtain the anaerobic condition kong et al 2018 all flasks were placed in a thermostatic shaker and cultivated at 35 c and 120 rpm bt300 yamato japan the volume of the gas produced was measured once an hour and the relationship between n2 volume and cultivation time was fitted with modified gompertz equation to calculate the specific anammox activity saa and lag phase time ma et al 2019 based on the kinetics of anammox model a reaction time of 24 hours was employed to ensure all the experiments on the anammox reaction could be completed niu et al 2016 the liquid samples were then retrieved filtered by membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c before the following analysis 2 4 synthetic substrate the recipe for synthetic wastewater was as follows 0 472 g l 1 of nh4 2so4 0 59 g l 1 of nano2 0 057 g l 1 of kh2po4 0 3 g l 1 of cacl2 2h2o 0 5 g l 1 of nahco3 0 57 g l 1 of kcl 0 2 g l 1 of mgso4 7h2o the trace element solution was identical to that reported in a previous study ma et al 2018 some specific experiments excluded specific ions as was explained in detail in section 2 2 2 5 eps extraction the s eps was extracted by adding 30 ml of 0 1 m nacl solution and centrifuging the solution at 4000g for 10 min the supernatants were filtered through a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm to obtain s eps the residual solid was subsequently centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min with the same concentration and quantity of an nacl solution again an identical membrane was used to filter the supernatant and l eps was obtained a cation exchange resin cer dowex marathontm c sodium form na form strongly acidic 20 50 mesh was added in the residual solid at 70 g g 1vss and the mixture was then stirred at 800 rpm for 4 h followed by 20 mins of centrifuging at 20000g after an identical filtering step the t eps was retrieved guo et al 2017 jia et al 2017 a chemical analysis on the eps was conducted on measuring the polysaccharide and protein content according to procedure outlined in a previous report xue et al 2020 2 6 analyses of liquid samples and granules the elements ca p mg and fe in the liquid samples and granules were analyzed by agilent 720 inductively coupled a plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa after being pretreated by acid digestion inorganic carbon ic in the liquid samples was detected by ion chromatography metrohm basic ic plus 883 the ph was measured by a ph meter toa hm 30v the xrd analysis for sludge was performed by the rigaku ultima iv system using cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma ma et al 2020 the heme c analysis technique was the same as that described in an earlier paper ma et al 2019 2 7 acid neutralization capacity acid neutralization capacity was determined by titration with 4g of wet sludge in 50ml of deionized water using 0 1 mol l 1 hcl under 400 rpm the ph was measured by a ph meter toa hm 30v 2 8 calculations 2 8 1 saturation index the saturation index si was used to define the saturation state in the solution in this study it was calculated by the visual miteq3 1 software using the following equation 3 si log i a p k s where iap and ks represent ionic activity and the thermodynamic solubility of the precipitated phase respectively once the si exceeds 0 the potential for the precipitate to form is assumed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of anammox granules on the hap process 3 1 1 effect of anammox reaction on the hap process no evidence of an anammox reaction was revealed in the results of the tests on the samples with no n source nh4 and no2 as shown in fig 1 the results demonstrated that granules under this condition maintained a ph of 7 8 most likely due to the buffering effect of the synthetic substrate and granules the solution ph was maintained at 8 4 in the solution with granules which underwent an anammox reaction due to alkaline supply from the reaction in contrast to the control group the effluent ca2 concentration increased to 51 7 mg l 1 close to that of p indicating that hap was not affected when there was no anammox reaction the anammox reaction did not play an important role in hap crystallization in mature anammox hap coupled granules the phenomenon of a decrease in ca removal efficiency was due to the inhibition of other ca precipitations such as caco3 comparisons between a1 and a2 fig 1c and d show that the removal efficiency dropped for ca but remained stable for p this suggests that the high si of hap which was within the range of 7 38 11 80 meant that it was unaffected by the formation of the hap process under a ph of 7 8 the si at 0 65 at a ph of 8 indicated that the residual ca continued to react with co3 2 after precipitation with p to form a small amount of caco3 in the granules therefore hap and caco3 precipitation occurred simultaneously as a result of co3 2 removal the co3 2 removal efficiency in a2 was lower than that in a1 fig s1 this can be attributed to insufficient alkalinity in a2 in the absence of the anammox reaction as can be seen from the decrease in the ph in fig 1g and the stronger impact of the ph on caco3 precipitation than hap morse et al 2007 söhnel and mullin 1982 tobler et al 2016 fe was released from the granules and fe precipitation was also found in the granules icp oes revealed that total fe content was 0 19 in dry granules of which 0 06 was fe2 0 03 was fe in heme c and 0 1 was fe of other forms fig s3 3 1 2 the hap core are a key factor for precipitation process fig 1c and d show that the sludge was essential for ca and p removal the granules were heated to 600 c to remove vss the hap core obtained was crystal seeds according to fig 1d p removal efficiency was at a high 96 1 and the effluent concentration decreased to 0 8 mg l 1 the reduced ca removal efficiency was attributed to removal suppression due to caco3 precipitation this was because the low si of caco3 at only 0 65 at a ph of 7 does not provide enough alkalinity to precipitate caco3 despite this the hap process was facilitated mg was released from the burned granules and the ph increased to 8 0 for anammox hap coupled granules the hap core was one of the factors with the strongest effect on p removal in hap this was likely due to the elimination of the organic fractions of anammox cells and eps the test results with no ca and p removal for samples without granular sludge indicated that granules play an important role in formation of hap the hap precipitation procedure maintained a stable p removal efficiency with no anammox reaction indicating that hap continued even when no alkaline was generated from the anammox reaction in intact anammox hap coupled granules the dry granules contained 17 1 of ca and 8 7 of p as shown in table 1 this is in good agreement with the xrd analysis results showing hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 fig s2 a high p removal efficiency in granules without vss is evidence that the precipitation residues served as crystal seeds to promote the occurrence of hap precipitation by reducing the activation energy lüttge 2006 although the outer layer of the granules was covered by anammox biofilms ma et al 2020 the formation of hap in anammox coupled granule was found to obey classic nucleation theory which states that small crystals act as the nuclei and the size of the nuclei will grow to form a thermodynamically stable phase fig 8a baumgartner et al 2013 the experimental results clearly indicated that the effect of the biological factors on the precipitation process was minimal also little interference was observed between the anammox and precipitation processes further implying a competitive relationship this relationship may have resulted in an unexpected precipitation process on the anammox cells to prevent the mass transfer ma et al 2020 to prevent mass transfer limitations in anammox due to the excess accumulation of precipitation the sludge concentration could be regulated during its removal 3 2 effects of eps on hap process 3 2 1 effects of granules without eps the effluent concentrations of ca in the experimental sets l t and t were higher than those in s l t 36 9 mg l 1 while the concentration in the test set without any eps was lower an increase in the removal efficiency was observed at 61 3 fig 2b and c while there was a decrease in p removal efficiency when the granules with no eps were introduced the removal efficiency decreased to 70 fig 2c and the influent and effluent ph values were around 7 5 and 8 3 respectively 3 2 2 effects of eps in different bonding status on hap the increase of ca concentration in s1 and l1 samples is shown in fig 2d this increase was attributed to the presence of ca2 in the eps extraction solutions which cannot react with s eps or l eps however the ca removal efficiency in t1 samples increased by 6 0 suggesting that only t eps could react with ca2 the study found hydroxyl groups in eps to bind with ca2 for microbial aggregation and granulation sajjad and kim 2015 compared to l eps and s eps the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins was higher in t eps as is shown in fig 2f therefore t eps exhibited a more predominant role in binding with ca the increase in the p concentration shown in fig 2e was likely due to the accumulation of extraction solutions for eps and the substrate in the tests of s1 l1 and t1 indicating that p ions cannot react with eps by themselves the ph values of the influent and effluent for all these samples were between 7 5 7 8 3 2 3 precipitation via eps induced biomineralization the results of this investigation strongly suggest that the anammox hap process is affected strongly by the hap core another important factor is extracellular matrix controlled biomineralization as has been reported in an earlier study it was shown in this study to play a role in creating the nuclei which induces precipitation weiner and addadi 2011 apart from a rise in ph caused by the anammox reaction the effects of eps on p removal in section 3 2 1 are also evidence for this assumption both ca and p removal efficiency gradually decreased when the eps was removed from the granules regardless of the strength of the binding status indicating a shortage of eps may limit the progress of hap in anammox granules it has been reported that granules with intact eps may promote ca and p removal since eps can adsorb the ions through its functional groups to create the necessary condition for precipitation obst et al 2009 when all of the eps was removed the ca removal rate increased while the p removal rate decreased this may be attributed to the exchange of ca with sodium ions when the eps was extracted by resin resulting in an insufficient amount of ca for the precipitation residues since the supply of ca was from the bulk solution for the mixtures of eps and the substrate only t eps was found to induce precipitation with a higher ca removal and no drop in the p concentration this was associated with the functional groups in t eps which are selective to ca the organic matters in eps such as polysaccharides and proteins were bridged by a multivalent cation ca2 for structural stability shi et al 2017 the experimental results for the eps samples indicated that while p is not directly affected by eps ca can react with eps and that this has a further impact on the p concentration the biomineralization induced by eps with hap core is a necessary procedure fig 8b however due to the low ca and p removal rates eps is considered a minor factor in hap formation for anammox hap granules 3 3 effects of sludge concentration on hap process 3 3 1 effect of granules as crystal seeds for hap process as shown in fig 3 a and b the ca and p removal efficiencies increased and reached equilibrium with the rise in the sludge concentration after 24 hours when the reaction time was extended to 96 hours the removal efficiencies of both ca and p under all concentrations of sludge additives gradually achieved their maximum values also fig 3 indicated that the increased sludge concentration enhanced ca and p removal and that the optimal sludge concentration for the start up of the anammox hap process is over of 6 gss l 1 according to the lamer model lamer and dinegar 1950 the increased sludge concentration shortened the reaction time of hap crystallization which is indication of its role as the crystal seeds in reducing the nucleation time 3 3 2 formation mechanism of hap for anammox granule based on lamer model during the initial stage of formation with no crystal seeds of hap inside granules biomineralization was the dominant process for crystallization the eps and cell surface in the anammox biofilms are considered to be crystal sites under a high ph and may act as the driving force for nucleation lu and leng 2005 it has been reported that eps is capable of reacting with ca2 and further engaging with p to form hap shi et al 2017 either a slow precipitation rate in the solid phase or a low removal rate in the liquid phase appeared at this stage since as suggested by the lamer model the process needs a certain length of time for nucleation which is controlled by biomineralization lamer and dinegar 1950 lin et al 2013 weiner and addadi 2011 therefore the addition of crystal seeds to the sludge could serve as a strategy to enhance nucleation once nucleation is completed the precipitation is intensified and is not controlled by biological factors the supersaturation index of hap calculated by minteq 3 1 is a positive number when the ph is higher than 6 table 2 this suggests that the operational ph for hap is in the neutral range when crystal seeds are present in the granules fig 4 therefore the ph in these granules is not a significant factor during the growth of crystal seeds biomineralization at this stage is believed to be negligible since precipitation occurs with no biological content while eps is available on the other hand without the controls of an anammox biofilm and reaction the competitive accumulation between anammox biomass and mineral precipitation in the reactor has the potential to be problematic in an earlier study it was reported that unexpected hap precipitation accumulation in the reactor restricted anammox sludge accumulation ma et al 2020 according to the findings of another study avoiding this is possible by monitoring the growth rates of anammox and precipitation xue et al 2020 3 4 effects of ph on precipitation and anammox processes 3 4 1 the role of anammox hap coupled granules to neutralize acids as shown in fig 4a the ca removal efficiency dropped along with the initial decrease in the ph from 7 0 to 3 0 reaching almost 0 at a ph of 4 0 the dissolution of ca occurred when the influent ph was 3 0 because the ca concentration in the bulk solution was higher than its initial value p could remain in its precipitated form when ca was released from caco3 eq 8 the largest factor affecting the precipitation of caco3 was ph because the si of caco3 is below 0 when ph is lower than 7 however the si of hap is still 1 537 at ph of 6 because the amount of ca released was less than the amount consumed there was an increase in the concentration of p and a decrease in the concentration of ca compared with that of initial values as shown in fig 4a the similar drop in the curve seen in fig 4e indicates the mg removal efficiency when the influent ph dropped the dissolution ph of mg precipitation was around 5 0 leentvaar and rebhun 1982 however compared with ca the consumption of mg 5 0 mg l in this study was rather low 8 2 c a c o 3 3 h 2 c a 2 h c o 3 h 2 c o 3 although the p removal efficiency also slightly declined along with lower influent ph it remained higher than 68 5 in all test samples indicating that the significance of influent ph on p removal is rather small furthermore the p removal efficiency remained at a high value of 88 7 even when the influent ph was lowered to 4 0 according to the theoretical supersaturation index calculations shown in table 2 phosphate precipitation only occurs when ph is higher than 6 however effective p removal was obtained at an influent ph of 3 this is due to the ability of the granules to adjust ph elevating the effluent ph to 7 and inducing the supersaturation condition seen in fig 4b and d although the influent ph varied from 3 0 to7 0 the anammox hap coupled granules exhibited impressive acid neutralization capacities the largest ph variation observed between the influent and effluent fluids was 4 0 after 24 h fig 4d since the effluent ph values of all samples were kept at 8 2 0 2 while the influent ph ranged from 4 0 to 7 0 it can be assumed that the anammox hap coupled granules have a high ph buffering capability in contrast to the theoretical anammox reactions eq 1 where 0 057 mol of h is necessary for the consumption of 1 mol of nh4 lotti et al 2014 a dramatic increase in ph was obtained in samples with an influent ph of below 5 exceeding the neutralization capacity of microorganisms in the anammox process 3 4 2 the specific anammox activity under low ph in previous studies a remarkable inhibition in saa at ph of 6 has been reported resulting in unstable reactor performance li et al 2017 tomaszewski et al 2017 however the fluctuation in our saa tests was negligible for influent ph values from 6 to 7 thanks to the accumulated alkaline precipitation in granules fig 4c a decrease in saa started to appear at an influent ph of 5 when the influent ph was 4 the saa was maintained at over 72 but it sharply decreased at a ph of 3 to 11 that at ph 7 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the granular buffering capability was exceeded the anammox reaction even occurred when the ph of the influent was as low as 3 due to the buffering capability of anammox granules as shown in fig 4c 3 4 3 acid neutralization capacity the acid neutralization capacity of anammox hap coupled granules is shown in fig 5 the acid neutralization capacity of the granules was 0 08 mmol h ss g 1 since the ph of over 6 5 was a comfortable environment for anammox jin et al 2012 in the even of an obvious drop in ph to 4 6 at an equivalence point an increase in hcl of 1 2 mmol h ss g 1 would have been expected fig s4 3 4 4 the effect of ph on maintaining the hap core and biomineralization in this study alkali neutralization and anammox activity deterioration were caused by the addition of acids the similar p removal efficiency under different ph values indicated that influent ph is a minor factor in the formation of hap however the alkali mineral formations are covered by biofilms in the granules which was caused by the alkalinity from the anammox reaction over a long time this implies that different compositions of alkali mineral systems could be formed in the anammox granules under a variety of biological effects and different ph conditions as a result the alkali mineral acted as a nucleus and promoted the formation of hap for the granules coupling anammox and precipitation a hypothesis for nucleation formation is that the increased ph from anammox reaction promotes p nucleation in the early stage of anammox granule formation when no precipitation has yet to take place the results suggest that ph plays a double role in the formation of hap in anammox coupled granules ph serves as a motor for nucleation in the early stage and as a nucleus stabilizer at a later stage 3 4 5 the precipitation of iron in granules it was found that fe was the abundant heme protein in anammox cells heme c is a component of a series of enzymes involved in anammox metabolic reactions for electron transfer and electron storage and is considered an indicator of anammox activity ma et al 2019 in this study although the influent fe concentration was 1mg l 1 its removal efficiency was over 60 even when the ph was lowered to 5 however the efficiency decreased significantly to 38 5 at ph 4 0 and 12 4 at 3 0 as shown in fig 4f in addition heme c was not observed in all effluent liquid samples data not shown indicating that intracellular fe did not release from cells in these tests since the amount of n2 released in all samples was the same the difference in the fe removal rates was likely due to the effect of influent ph rather than the anammox reaction hence the variations of fe concentration in the bulk solution could influence precipitation rather than being consumed in the production of relevant enzymes for proliferation in cells a large proportion of removed fe underwent precipitation eq 9 eq 10 eq 11 calculated by miteq 3 1 software as a result the effect of fe supplements a strategy to enhance activity of anammox cell was lower than expected moreover insufficient fe also led to lower anammox reaction activity when added to the solution because of competitions brought by fe precipitation and insufficient fe to synthesize relevant enzymes liu and ni 2015 9 f e 2 c o 3 2 f e c o 3 10 f e 2 o h f e o h 2 11 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 8

index si in table 3 estimated the tendency of precipitation with different ions compared to the ca removal efficiency of the control group 53 the ca removal efficiency was lower at 42 in the substrate without po4 3 and 32 in the substrate without co3 2 as shown in fig 6 b a higher p removal efficiency than the control group was recorded in the group with no carbonates fig 6c suggesting competition between phosphates and carbonates to precipitate with ca although ca and mg both had an effect on the p removal efficiency the contribution of ca was higher according to the results of this study as demonstrated in fig 6d mg reacted with po4 3 and co3 2 for precipitation eq 12 eq 13 calculated by miteq 3 1 software this is evident in the constant concentrations of mg in the group with no po4 3 or co3 2 also an increase in mg removal efficiency was observed when no ca2 was present even though the substrate with neither po4 3 nor co3 2 was unsaturated as indicated in table 3 its ca removal efficiency was found to be 21 likewise in the unsaturated solution without ca2 and mg2 the p removal efficiency remained over 40 therefore precipitation was not the only route for utilizing ca and p in this experiment as was reported in an early study it was possible that the following ion exchange and adsorption occurred under unsaturated condition zhou et al 2005 12 m g 2 c o 3 2 m g c o 3 13 m g 2 p o 4 3 n h 4 m g n h 4 p o 4 3 5 2 ion exchange in anammox hap coupled process the substrate was kept unsaturated to exclude the influence of precipitation when determining the ion exchange in the anammox hap coupled process in addition p and inorganic carbon ic were removed to investigate adsorption and the ion exchange of ca while in other samples ca and mg were removed to investigate adsorption and the ion exchange of p in the unsaturated solution with no potential for a precipitate to form ca and p removal was observable with both reaching an equilibrium as the substrate concentration rose as shown in fig 7 a and d simultaneously fig 7b and e showed that the dissolution of mg and ic from sludge were intensified with a higher concentration of ca and p therefore it is reasonable to conclude that ion exchange is responsible for the increase in mg and ic release eq 14 eq 15 besides the correlation between mg release and ca adsorption was linear as was that between ic release and p adsorption r2 0 9 the slopes of ion exchanges between ca and mg ions as well as between inorganic p and c were around 0 33 and 0 28 lower than the theoretical values respectively we can deduce from these results that ca and p adsorption surpassed mg and ic release indicating these ion exchanges were not equivalent also our findings suggest that the adsorption of ca and p occurred simultaneously in the granules which was potentially caused by biosorption to functional groups in eps and adsorption to the hap cores song et al 2007 14 c a 2 m g x c a x m g 2 15 2 p o 4 3 3 x c o 3 3 x p o 4 2 3 c o 3 2 3 5 3 application of anammox hap coupled process in the anammox hap process it has been reported that the settleability of granules is improved with a settling velocity of over 200 m h 1 and a specific density of over 1 25 g cm 1 ma et al 2018 xue et al 2020 high settleability has been attributed to the integration of precipitation and the anammox biofilm which also enhances the enrichment of anammox cells in the reactor ma et al 2018 leading to a high volumetric load xue et al 2020 in this work alkalinity inside the granules was found to be in the optimum range due to the abundant co3 2 precipitation inside the granules these ions are capable of controlling the ph within an optimal range for cell growth anammox sludge without this precipitation has been reported to be sensitive to tiny ph shocks causing a remarkable drop in anammox activity due to the inhibition of free nitrous acid or ammonia ma et al 2017 because the anammox hap coupled granules were more resilient in terms of tolerance of ph variations than other granules they would be well suited to applications of the anammox process in the treatment of nitrogen containing wastewaters with diverse and fluctuant ph values besides a stable p removal performance was obtained even with a considerable decrease in anammox activity and ph that is the anammox hap coupled process can be used as a simple tool for the control of both the control anammox process and hap process since the precipitation and anammox processes are considered to be relatively independent of one another for granules with precipitation the ion competition between inorganic p and c needs to be carefully monitored to mitigate its effect when applying the anammox hap process to real wastewater especially if the concentration of co3 2 is high from the results in the study a strategy to offset the effect if ion competition between inorganic p and c under high co3 2 conditions would be to decrease the ph to prevent caco3 precipitation and therefore enhance p recovery efficiency in addition the diversiform minerals in the granules could be purified by ion exchange to improve the quality of the p recovery resource the effect of ion exchange and adsorption was considerable ca and p removal under the unsaturated condition when treated with anammox hap coupled granules this ion exchange and adsorption indicates that this strategy could be adopted to ensure that stable p recovery was maintained under insufficient ca in the short term in other words ion exchange and adsorption also play important roles in ion removal and precipitation by maintaining the stability of the process 4 implications of this work the results of this study show the importance of a vital step which is the formation of necessary nucleation coupled anammox biofilms however as a rather unwanted outcome of crystallization the issue with scaling was that precipitation occurred on the inner side of the reactor walls and tubes as showed in fig s5 as has been reported in an early study this resulted in unstable operations ohtake and tsuneda 2018 for a fast start up anammox process the results of this study show that the addition of anammox hap coupled granules as sludge seeds in reactor is an effective strategy in the treatment of wastewater with low concentrations of ca and p this strategy promotes precipitation based on ion exchange and supersaturation theories furthermore it can be applied in the treatment of various kinds of wastewater 5 conclusions in this study anammox hap coupled granules were investigated to determine their formation mechanism some of the key findings are as follows chemical crystallization and biomineralization as synergy facilitate the formation of hap in anammox granules the hap core plays a key role in the formation of hap in anammox granules by providing a diversiform precipitation containing ca mg fe p and inorganic carbon in granules eps acts as a minor factor in formation of hap in anammox granules and promotes ca and p removal especially that of t eps anammox hap coupled granular sludge provides the crystal seeds for ca and p removal anammox hap coupled granules are capable of buffering ph with 0 08 mmol h ss g 1 to maintain a ph of over 6 5 for a comfortable environment for anammox competition exchange between ca and mg ions as well as between inorganic p and c and ion exchange were observed in anammox hap coupled granules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
