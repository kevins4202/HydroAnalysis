14375,the wastewater from conventional manufacturing processes of superabsorbent poly vinyl alcohol pva sponge contains high cod chemical oxygen demand to minimize environmental pollution and possibly reuse certain chemical ingredients in the wastewater we have developed a process that reuses the recycled wastewater in this work results of tensile test as well as images from scanning electron microscope sem revealed the quality of the sponges produced we found that both the structural morphology i e porosity and the modulus of the sponges made in this innovative process by reusing wastewater can be as good as those of sponges made by virgin or raw chemicals moreover based on the results of thermogravimetric analysis tga the water adsorption capacity of the pva sponges made in this innovative process can still meet the requirements for the superabsorbent keywords polyvinyl alcohol sponge wastewater reuse 1 introduction porous poly vinyl alcohol pva sponge is a well known hydrophilic superabsorbent polymer sap commonly used in household cleaning and washing 1 it is also used in sponge rollers in the post cmp process for cleaning silicon wafers in the semi conductor manufacturing plants 2 the conventional porous pva sponge was made by hybrid acetalization reaction of highly hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol with formaldehyde in the presence of pore making agent such as wheat starch and catalyst such as sulfuric acid however when the pore making agent is washed off by water in the final step of the pva sponge manufacturing process the wastewater contains high concentration of starch with chemical oxygen demand cod as high as 10 000 mg l as recorded by a local pva sponge manufacturing plant in taiwan 3 meanwhile due to the low conversion rate of formaldehyde i e as low as 60 as reported in our previous paper 4 the unreacted formaldehydes in the wastewater may pollute the environment as well taiwan s environmental protection agency epa regulates the discharge of formaldehyde to the environment due to its toxicity and persistence in soil and ground water the upper limit for formaldehyde discharge is set at 3 0 mg l to minimize potential environmental pollution problems caused by the wastewater discharged from pva sponge manufacture plants there is a strong incentive for the industry to tackle the problems mentioned above high cod due to starch washed off and significant residual formaldehyde in the waste water moreover the ingredients in wastewater such as starch and formaldehyde are actually involved in the sponge making process either as the pore making agent or a reactant for acetalization recycling and reusing wastewater may mean less consumption of virgin or raw chemicals that may bring about significant economic benefits therefore our research group developed a process that recycles and reuses the wastewater from conventional sponge making processes detailed steps in recycling and reusing the wastewater are presented in this work the properties of sponges made by this innovative process named as pva reuse are also compared with those made by the conventional process named pva raw using virgin or raw chemicals without recycling and reusing wastewater we will present the results of analysis by using scanning electron microscope sem that reveals the structural morphology of the present pva reuse sponges compared with that of pva raw sponges additionally the effects of pva concentration on the mechanical modulus and the water adsorption capacity of the pva reuse sponges were investigated in detail by using tensile tests and the tga tests respectively 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercial pva bf 05 99 3 wt with an average degree of polymerization of 500 and degree of hydrolysis of 98 5 99 2 mol was obtained from chang chun petrochemical co ltd taiwan deionized water was used as the solvent for pva all other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received 2 1 1 synthesis of pva raw sponge a dispersion of 9 g of wheat starch in 20 ml of water was first added to 230 ml of an aqueous solution containing 30 g of pva and mixed well the resulting mixture was heated up to 95 c about the gelatinization temperature of wheat starch 5 for 45 min while being stirred to obtain a pasty mixture this mixture was then cooled to 85 c and 55 5 ml of aqueous mixture containing 37 5 ml of 24 wt formaldehyde solution and 18 ml of 50 wt sulfuric acid was added the resulting mixture was mixed homogeneously to yield a reaction mixture that contained approximately 10 wt pva 12 wt formaldehyde and 3 0 wt wheat starch i e the weight ratio of formaldehyde pva was kept at 1 2 in the present study the above composition is summarized in table 1 the above reaction mixture was then introduced to a hard rectangular plastic vessel with a dimension of 15 cm 20 cm and 5 cm in height these vessels were then put in a temperature controlled oven to carry out the acetalization reaction at 50 c for eight hours the residual aqueous solution contained in the resulting pva raw sponge samples was then squeezed out i e about 220 ml obtained each time which was then reused to make the pva reuse sponge as follows 2 1 2 synthesis of pva reuse sponge the original pva were consumed completely when pva raw sponge was made based on the final conversion of formaldehyde using the calibration data for the absorbance versus formaldehyde concentration presented in fig 1 and a procedure presented in the appendix a we were able to compute the amount of formaldehyde consumed in making pva raw virgin pva and make up formaldehyde were then added to the 220 ml of wastewater obtained from the above pva raw sponge made i e based on the conversion rate of formaldehyde and the result obtained from the acid base titration method listed in appendix b this 220 ml reused wastewater was found to contain about 12 8 ml unreacted formaldehyde 16 14 ml residual sulfuric acid and 1 958 g residual wheat starch see table 1 the amounts of the virgin pva weight in grams and make up formaldehyde volume in ml are summarized in table 1 as shown in table 1 we attempted to resupply two different weights of pva to the 220 ml reused wastewater 1 26 g of pva in order to get 10 wt pva concentration same as that pva concentration in making pva raw sponge termed as pva reuse 26 sponge below and 2 30 g of pva same as the weight of pva in making pva raw sponge termed as pva reuse 30 sponge below the reaction condition for eight hours of acetalization at 50 c was still adopted in making those pva reuse sponges 2 2 determination of the conversion rate of formaldehyde in order to determine the conversion rate of formaldehyde in the present acetalization reaction the residual concentrations of formaldehyde in the reaction solutions at different reaction times were determined by the uv vis spectrophotometry 6 according to this method in the presence of excessive ammonium acetate i e 15 g per 250 ml the samples diluted with various amounts of distilled water were titrated by 2 4 pentanedione i e 0 2 wt to form 3 5 diacetyl 1 4 hydrolutine which is yellow in color and has a maximum absorbance of 412 nm the standard curve of the absorbance at 412 nm versus formaldehyde concentration is shown in fig 1 the method of calculating the conversion rate of formaldehyde is also demonstrated in appendix a 2 3 scanning electron microscope imaging to observe the pore size distribution of the present pva sponges the samples were coated with a thin layer of gold coating at 5 0 pa and 20 ma for 80 s and then monitored by a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7000f jeol japan at a 15 kv accelerating voltage 2 4 tensile test an instron universal test machine model 4467 was adopted to measure the young s modulus of pva sponges with 25 wt water content according to the standard procedure described by astm d638 99 the cross head load was 100 n and the extending speed was 20 mm min the modulus values of the sponge samples were determined by the average of six values 2 5 analyses of the water adsorption capacity the water adsorption capacity of pva sponge was determined by using a dupont tga q50 thermal analyzer 7 under a nitrogen flow rate of 100 cm3 min the water adsorption capacity of pva sponge was calculated from the weight loss at 100 c when each 20 mg sample was heated from room temperature to 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 3 results and discussion 3 1 the pore structures of pvf starch sponges figs 2 4 show the sem pictures of the pore structures of pva raw pva reuse 26 and pva reuse 30 sponges whose porosities can be analyzed by the image pro plus software 8 it can be found that the pore structures of those pva sponges shown in figs 2 4 all belong to an open cell type and double sized porous sponge but with different pore wall thicknesses both the micro pores and the macro pores of pva raw sponge are the same as those of pva reuse 26 sponge with an average diameter of 20 μm for the micro pores and 100 μm for the macro pores but some micro pores for pva reuse 30 sponge may become as bigger as 40 μm in diameter as shown in fig 4 this result is evidenced by the measured porosities as shown in fig 5 which demonstrates that the porosities of pva raw and pva reuse 26 sponges 0 45 are about the same with each other but smaller than that of pva reuse 30 sponge 0 52 since the molecules of wheat starch left in the reused wastewater 1 958 g which was determined by the centrifugation method see table 1 were already completely gelatinized and swollen when pva raw sponge was made therefore less amount of wheat starch needed to be resupplied 6 352 g see table 1 when pva reuse 26 and pva reuse 30 sponges were made in the present study i e 1 958 g 6 352 g 8 310 g which was smaller than 9 0 g starches added when pva raw sponge was made also because some pva molecules left in the wastewater were already partially polymerized when pva raw sponge was made we only resupplied 26 g pva i e 10 wt see table 1 when pva reuse 26 sponge was made this amount 26 g is less than the amount of 30 g pva added when pva raw sponge was made and consequently their porosities were about the same with each other however the physical strength of pva reuse 26 sponge is weaker than that of pva raw sponge see the results of tensile test shown in fig 6 therefore in order to increase its strength we attempted to resupply 30 g of pva i e 11 54 wt when pva reuse 30 sponge was made as shown in fig 4 the additional solid content of 4 g pva made the pore wall thickness of pva reuse 30 thicker than that of pva raw and of pva reuse 26 sponge as a result a stronger modulus is obtained for pva reuse 30 than that of pva reuse 26 sponge as shown in fig 6 higher viscosity due to higher pva added could be the main reason for higher porosity and thicker pore wall for pva reuse 30 sponge also resupplied wheat starch was more difficult to be distributed homogeneously but easier to flocculate with each other in its reacting solution this results in slower drainage velocity of pva polymer between those aggregated wheat starch because of its high viscosity 4 consequently the pore size and the wall thickness formatted in pva reuse 30 sponge were larger than that of pva raw and of pva reuse 26 sponge moreover when checking the pore wall structure in detail we can find that there are many micron sized voids existing in the smooth pore walls of pva raw sponge as shown in fig 2 which may be due to condensed water molecules formed during the hybrid reaction i e acetalization as mentioned in our previous papers 3 4 however the smooth pore wall surfaces become tangled and coexist with many small pores for those pva reuse 26 and pva reuse 30 sponges as shown in figs 3 and 4 the interference due to partially polymerized pva plus those acidified starch molecules i e decomposed to glucose like molecules at ph 2 6 2 7 see table 1 4 residing in the wastewater during the hybrid bond formation is believed to be the main cause additionally the residual polymerized pva and the acidified starch increased the viscosity of the solution when the reactant solutions of pva reuse 26 and pva reuse 30 sponges were prepared we found it difficult to agitate the solution to gain homogeneity this problem of inhomogeneous agitation likely made the pore wall surfaces become tangled as shown in figs 3 and 4 3 2 the conversion rate of formaldehyde by using the above mentioned determination method the conversion rate of formaldehyde in making pva raw sponge is found to be at 65 7 so the amount of formaldehyde remained in the wastewater is either 12 76 ml or 12 86 ml as shown in table 1 in order to keep the weight ratio of formaldehyde pva at 1 2 we had resupplied 20 89 ml and 24 64 ml formaldehyde when pva reuse 26 and pva reuse 30 sponge was made respectively the conversion rates of formaldehyde in making these two pva reuse sponges were then found at around 65 too 3 3 young s modulus of pva sponges fig 6 shows the young s modulus of three pva sponges made in the present study in this figure we can find that the young s modulus of pva reuse 26 sponge is lower than that of pva raw sponge this result can be explained by the fact that the hybrid bond strength of pva reuse 26 sponge was reduced because of the interference effect caused by those partially polymerized pva molecules and those acidified starch molecules enrolled in acetalization i e many small pores appear on the pore wall surfaces as shown in fig 3 this result can be evidenced by fig 7 which shows that the elongation of pva resue 16 sponge is lower than that of pva raw sponge caused by this interference effect in order to compensate this weakness of physical strength we had increased the amount of the resupplied pva from 26 g to 30 g when pva reuse 30 sponge was made in the present study then because the pore wall thickness becomes thicker see fig 4 the young s modulus of pva reuse 30 sponge was enhanced to a value as high as that of pva raw sponge as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 7 the elongation of pva reuse 30 sponge was only slightly high than that of pva 26 sponge but still lower than that of pva raw sponge 3 4 the water adsorption capacity of pva sponges fig 8 summarized the water adsorption capacities of three pva sponges made in the present study their water adsorption capacities of 82 87 all meet the requirement of the superabsorbent 9 also it can be found that the water adsorption capacity of pva reuse 30 sponge is the highest among the three sponges and its highest solid content of 11 54 wt pva and 0 52 in porosity is the major reason to cause this result in our future study in order to solve the agitation difficulty in homogeneity because of its increased viscosity caused by those partially polymerized pva and acidified starch molecules remained in the wastewater we will attempt to adjust the compositions shown in table 1 and reuse its wastewater for as many times as possible when pva raw sponge is made 4 conclusion to minimize environmental pollution due to wastewater that contains high cod and toxic formaldehyde in conventional pva sponge manufacturing process we developed an innovative process that reused the wastewater in making pva raw sponge the products pva reuse 26 and pva reuse 30 sponges were made successfully in the present study it was found that the structural morphology i e porosity of the pva reuse sponges is as good as that of pva raw sponge it was also found that the water adsorption capacities of the pva reuse sponges made in the present study also meet the requirement of the superabsorbent although the tensile strength of pva reuse 26 was somewhat lower than that of pva raw the tensile strength of pva reuse 30 was as good as that of pva raw overall the consumption of virgin chemicals particularly starch and formaldehyde was greatly reduced which may make our process economically feasible as well acknowledgement the financial support received from the national science council of the republic of china research grant no most 105 2221 e 029 026 is greatly appreciated appendix a the method of calculating the conversion rate of formaldehyde assume that w1 amount of pva added grams w 1 44 w 2 30 2 1 w 1 88 w 2 30 since the concentration of formaldehyde aqueous solution adopted in the present study is 24 wt so the equivalent of formaldehyde is equal to 30 0 24 125 so the equivalent ratio of formaldehyde versus pva is equal to 125 88 1 19 1 2 then for the amount of 30 g pva added the corresponding required amount of formaldehyde is 30 g 125 88 42 6 g then the conversion rate of formaldehyde t h e r e s i d u a l a m o u n t o f f o r m a l d e h y d e g r a m s 42 6 g r a m s 100 b based on the standard curve shown in fig 1 the formaldehyde concentration m remained in the

effluent as compared to conventional treatment processes while maintaining high concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mbr exhibits less environmental foot print high removal efficiency smaller sludge generation and complete removal of suspended solids as compared to conventional activated sludge cas process 1 also membranes specially designed for wastewater treatment have made the mbr an attractive alternative to cas processes membranes having pore size of less than 0 1 μm have taken the place of sedimentation process involved in conventional wastewater treatment 2 after the evolution of submerged membrane bioreactors operative energy of mbr has been significantly reduced which has made the mbr a viable choice for wastewater treatment further it gives an advantage of cleaning the membrane surface due to turbulence created by aeration in membrane tank 1 3 the startup period of mbr is much smaller as compared to cas process because in cas process most important thing is the good settleability of sludge which is achieved by the growth of floc forming microorganisms sometimes for a good start cas plants are inoculated with the sludge from acclimatized activated sludge wastewater treatment plants while in case of mbr development of biomass is very rapid because of complete rejection of suspended solids by membrane and thus having a shorter startup time as compared to cas 1 4 high chemical oxygen demand cod removal is achieved at startup because most of organic matter in municipal wastewater is in particulate form and is rejected by membrane while in case of nutrients removal like ammonia and nitrite properly developed microbial community is needed for their removal since nitrifying bacteria have low growth yield and rate the nutrients removal lags behind organic removal in case of newly commissioned plant 1 another major problem in case of mbr is the fouling of membrane which leads to severe flux decline increase in trans membrane pressure tmp and recurrent cleaning of membrane it has been proven that the operating conditions along with design parameters of mbr have significant effect on membrane fouling major factors include types of organic matter present in wastewater and biomass along with hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt and type of membrane used 5 6 in case of treatment performance many researchers have shown that removal efficiency depends upon srt higher the srt higher is the biomass concentration which leads to high removal efficiency longer srt is also useful in case of nutrients removal because it reduces the flushing of nitrifying bacteria out of reactor because of less sludge wasting 7 8 in this study performance evaluation of full scale mbr plant at start up and

tank wastewater characterization is reported in table 1 2 3 operating conditions mbr was inoculated with activated sludge from i 9 sewage treatment plant stp islamabad pakistan mbr was operated as batch reactor along with artificial feed for first week to stabilize the sewage sludge acclimatized condition was reached when ammonium n concentration became less than 1 mg l in supernatant and at that stage the membrane flux was initiated the initial membrane flux was set at 10 lmh and gradually it was increased to 12 lmh followed by 15 lmh and finally increased to 20 lmh while monitoring treatment performance and sludge characteristics under each flux condition after reaching 10 000 mg l of mlss in the m tank sludge wasting corresponding to 80 days of srt was implemented srt was gradually reduced with increase in flux i e increase in organic loading rate olr one out of the five bio tanks was used in addition to the m tank for the fluxes of 10 12 and 15 lmh corresponding to 4 50 3 75 and 3 00 h hrt respectively however when the plant was operated at 20 lmh flux another bio tank was added to the system to maintain the hrt at 3 h recirculation rate of sludge from membrane

analyzer 2 5 extraction and measurement of eps extracellular polymeric substances eps was extracted from mbr sludge by cation exchange resin method cer 11 50 ml sludge was collected from membrane tank and was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm under 4 c using refrigerated centrifuge k2015r pro research britain after 15 min centrifugation the supernatant was separated from sludge in case of loosely bound eps lb eps the sludge pellets which were extracted in the previous step were mixed with phosphate buffer mixed for 1 h using magnetic stirrer and then centrifuged for 15 min to separate supernatant in order to obtain tightly bound eps tb eps sludge pellets from the last stage were again mixed with buffer solution cation exchange resin cer was added to make volume of 50 ml final mixture was stirred for 1 h and lastly centrifuged for 15 min to separate supernatant total bound eps b eps was obtained by adding lb eps and tb eps protein concentration pn was measured by lowry

were used to develop the standard curve for pn polysaccharides ps concentration was measured by dubois method phenol sulfuric acid 13 absorption was measured at 490 nm after the solution turned yellow on addition of sulfuric acid and phenol glucose standard curve was used to determine the ps concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 unsteady to steady state treatment performance behavior of mbr mbr was initially started as a sequencing batch reactor without membrane filtration and was given artificial feed to grow biomass membrane filtration was initiated when ammonium n concentration became less than 1 mg l in the supernatant first complete run of mbr of 174 days until first recovery cleaning rc was covered under this study rc was performed after the tmp reached 60 kpa at mbr start up the mlss concentration was 2 g l of in the membrane tank and even at low mlss 85 of cod removal was initially observed as shown in fig 2 this initial cod removal infers that most of the organic matter in domestic wastewater was mostly readily biodegradable even without fully developed biomass cod removal increased due to increase in heterotrophic activity caused by rapid increase in mlss due to complete rejection by membrane average cod removal was about 85 in unsteady state but after achieving steady state i e achieving stable biomass concentration it was more than 90 throughout the run when filtration started ammonium n started to appear in effluent which was then controlled by starting the sludge recirculation at the rate of 3 q three times of effluent flowrate between m tank and bio tank to promote nitrification as shown in fig 3 ammonium n was 14 0 11 8 and 6 2 mg l in effluent for first 3 days and then became undetected throughout the run i e less than 1 mg l in effluent this indicates that nutrients removal lags behind the organic removal since nitrifying bacteria are relatively slow growing and need some time to develop 1 in case of phosphate p removal efficiency was less than 50 at start up but after the acclimatization period of 4 and 5 days it became stable to more than 80 throughout the run overall variation of phosphate p in influent and effluent along with removal efficiency are reported in fig 4 the stable phosphate p removal of 80 85 removal may be attributed to maturing of phosphate accumulating organisms paos 3 2 treatment performance at different combinations of srt and flux treatment performance at different combinations of srt and flux are presented in table 4 cod removal of more than 90 was observed under all combinations of srt and flux with average cod in effluent less than 20 mg l which was also observed in other mbr studies 5 14 the full scale mbr exhibited high potential for biodegradation and filtration as compared to other conventional treatment processes 16 however there was a slight decline in cod removal efficiency with shorter srts of 15 and 20 days because of relatively lower microbial concentration 5 and may be because of relatively higher eps production 15 although variation in sludge characteristics at different srts was significant there was no major difference in performance of mbr throughout the study period 17 in case of nh4 n nitrification became stable after the sludge recirculation started and removal efficiency remained 99 9 throughout the run regardless of srt and flux and similar effect was observed in another study 15 removal of nh4 n was mostly by biological nitrification in the reactor prior to the membrane filtration process however membrane acts as strong barrier to keep nitrifying microorganisms in the reactor and thus proliferates the autotrophic nitrifiers without any loss indirectly facilitating nitrification 18 average phosphate p was 12 16 mg l in influent and the removal varied from 80 to 85 during the study period slight decrease in removal efficiency was observed with decrease in srt may be because of decrease in paos concentration due to higher wastage of sludge at lower srt the high phosphate p removal may be due to high concentration of biomass in mbr and limited dissolved oxygen the do concentration gradient inside flocs may have played a vital role in removal of phosphate p due to the limited do diffusion and high oxygen consumption by nitrifiers inner portion of flocs exhibit smaller anoxic zones which might have favored the proliferation of phosphates accumulating organisms 19 tss removal was 99 9 throughout the run and turbidity in effluent was 0 4 0 6 ntu which proves that the ultrafiltration uf membrane was very efficient in removal of suspended solids and can be considered as a complete physical barrier for suspended and colloidal solids 5 3 3 sludge characteristics at different combinations of srt and flux 3 3 1 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss biomass concentration reduced with lower srt because of higher sludge wastage rate as shown in fig 5 depicting variation in biomass concentration with changes in srt and flux the biomass concentration was higher initially because of no sludge wastage and complete rejection of suspended solids by membrane fibers the sludge wastage started when mlss reached 10 g l target was to maintain 8 10 g l of mlss in the m tank average mlss during flux of 15 lmh and srt of 80 40 30 20 and 15 days was 10 4 9 5 8 6 8 2 and 7 5 g l respectively while during flux of 20 lmh and srt of 20 days mlss was 9 g l the target mlss 8 10 g l was achieved in all cases except for 15 days srt at 15 lmh flux mlss became stable again to approximately 9 g l in case of 20 days srt and 20 lmh flux it was observed that the membrane tank had more biomass as compared to bio tank s because of complete ss rejection by membrane fibers on the other hand mlvss mlss ratio was found to be better in case of lower srt due to shorter srt relatively more old sludge in endogenous phase is wasted and replaced by new actively growing sludge and thus mlvss mlss ratio improves 3 3 2 capillary suction time cst and sludge volume index svi other sludge characteristics were also measured in term of capillary suction time cst sludge volume index svi particle size distribution psd and extracellular polymeric substances eps cst test is a convenient method of measuring dewaterability of sludge without external source of pressure or suction requirement a large cst usually implies poor sludge dewaterability as reported in table 5 cst was higher for longer srt and lower in case of shorter srt and similar observation was witnessed in another study 15 highest cst was obtained for 80 days srt and 15 lmh flux combination however 15 days srt and 15 lmh flux gave the lowest cst values it may be because at lower srt mlss reduced below 8 g l and as a result cst decreased sludge volume index svi was very high at start up because the bio flocs were loosely aggregated not dense exhibiting slower settling rate after sludge buildup and acclimatization svi starting improving with time as reported in table 5 svi improved with increase in mlss as well as due to sludge flocs maturation with time however svi is not considered an important parameter which affects mbr filtration performance directly however it may be considered vital during the waste sludge handling and treatment stage considering sludge dewaterablity 1 lowest svi was achieved at 15 days srt with 15 lmh flux when the mlss was below 8 g l followed by 20 days srt with 20 lmh flux when mlss was within target range of 8 10 g l in case of longer srt higher biomass concentration and relatively lower food to microorganism f m ratio may have caused the slower settling rate hence selection of an appropriate srt is very important in order to attain effective separation of sludge flocs from treated effluent 20 3 3 3 particle size distribution psd and mean particle size mbr sludge was sonicated for 30 min before analyzing particle size distribution psd as per requirement of the psd analyzer so the psd shown in fig 6 a may not reflect the actual trend of floc sizes in the sludge fig 6 a shows that in case of shortest srt of 15 days distribution curve was skewed exhibiting mbr sludge being composed of high proportion of smaller sized particles moving towards longer srt the curve shifts towards right side representing increase in particle size with increase in srt this trend can also be observed in fig 6 b where proportion of particles having size less than 3 5 μm were found to be more in case of shorter srt these smaller particles play an important role in membrane colloidal fouling in addition to the bio cake development in case of mbr smaller particles tend to cause membrane pore blockage while larger particles may have less effect on membrane fouling because of higher shear induced diffusion 20 the main reason for particle size reduction at shorter srt is the higher hydraulic strain and stress under lower microbial concentration enhancing the floc breakage size of flocs has inverse relationship with hydraulic stress magnitude and duration 18 in our study hrt of 3 h was constant under all combinations of srt and flux and mainly hydraulic stress at lower mlss concentration i e at lower srt may cause smaller particles sizes in the mbr sludge 3 3 4 extracellular polymeric substances eps membrane biofouling depends upon extra cellular polymeric substances eps concentration in the sludge eps are basically polymers of macromolecules which are secreted by microorganisms under different conditions 22 eps has been identified and considered as a major foulant in case of mbr it is attached to flocs as bound eps and also present in supernatant as soluble microbial products smp 21 in this study soluble eps was referred to as smp and bound eps b eps constituting loosely and tightly bound eps variety of substances like lipids carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids are present in eps matrix however sum of proteins and carbohydrates are considered as total eps or smp because of their dominance as compared to other constituents 23 in this study both smp and b eps were analyzed in proteins and carbohydrates form the average smp and b eps during flux of 15 lmh and srt of 80 40 30 20 and 15 days were 69 77 89 101 and 108 mg l respectively and 34 1 40 8 50 3 55 8 and 61 5 mg g mlvss respectively while during last stage of 20 lmh flux and 20 days srt smp and b eps were 123 mg l and 55 7 mg g mlvss respectively as shown in figs 7 and 8 smp and b eps trends show that both types of eps were lower in case of longer srt and vice versa at longer srt f m ratio decreases due to increase in biomass concentration and as a result less food is available to microorganisms under this condition microbial metabolism decreases and higher proportion of microbes move into endogenous respiration phase which ultimately reduces generation of microbial by products and causes lower eps production 17 24 results indicate that p c ratio for smp increased from 1 22 to 1 40 from 80 to 15 days srt for 15 lmh flux and 1 46 in case of 20 days srt and 20 lmh flux p c ratio for b eps showed similar trend however the increase in p c was relatively lower from 1 13 to 1 27 microbial flocs at shorter srt had a relatively higher soluble protein as compared to carbohydrate concentrations carbohydrates are synthesized extracellularly for a specific function while proteins can exist in the extracellular polymer network due to the excretion of intracellular polymers or cell lysis 18 3 4 membrane fouling fig 9 shows that the tmp started from 5 kpa at start up flux of 10 lmh and then raised from 13 0 to 16 7 kpa when flux increased from 10 to 12 lmh tmp further increased from 17 to 19 kpa when flux was raised from 12 to 15 lmh finally when flux was changed to ultimate flux of 20 lmh biggest tmp jump was observed from 45 to 49 kpa all three major jumps in tmp profile are highlighted in fig 9 fouling potential was faster at higher flux because increase in flux reflects increase in organic loading rate olr it was also observed that decrease in srt resulted in higher tmp mainly due to higher eps production in the form of smp as well as b eps as observed in figs 7 and 8 higher eps concentration was also observed at lower srt in another study 21 soluble eps or smp is usually notorious for being the major cause of membrane fouling in water phase 25 another reason for higher tmp for shorter srt could be the reduction in size of bio particles it can be observed from particle size distribution psd results that proportion of smaller particles was higher under shorter srt as compared to longer srt thus higher tmp observed could be due to higher proportion of pore blockage caused by smaller particles in case of lower srt 20 so at srt of 15 days under 15 lmh flux membrane fouling in terms of tmp was severe with combined effect of high eps generation and fine particles in mbr sludge as compared to longer srt of 20 days under 20 lmh flux it can also be observed in tmp profile that tmp became stable for 35 days when 20 days srt and 20 lmh flux was adapted in the last stage of the study membrane filtration finally showed a jump in tmp and entered into irreversible fouling phase completing the total run of 174 days 4 conclusions in this study at mbr start up the nutrients removal performance in terms of ammonium n and phosphate p reached optimal effluent values in the permeate within 3 5 days while optimal cod removal was achieved instantly due to readily biodegradable organic matter in real domestic wastewater complete tss rejection throughout the mbr operation proved the effectiveness of uf hollow fiber membrane as an ultimate physical barrier for suspended solids higher srt favored superior treatment performance resulting in higher concentration of biomass but demonstrated poor sludge settling characteristics in case of lower srt of 15 days treatment performance suffered a bit along with less biomass concentration in reference to target mlss of 8 10 g l cst svi and mean particle size of sludge were observed to be less with shorter sludge age and vice versa tmp steadily increased with step wise increase in membrane flux over the operational period overall higher flux and shorter srt lead to rapid membrane fouling it was also observed that the eps production which is directly related to membrane fouling increased with shorter srt overall 20 days srt with 20 lmh flux proved to be the optimal combination for the full scale mbr plant keeping in view filtration rate treatment performance and sludge characteristics this study infers that at mbr start up flux and srt are very important parameters of a mbr operation from unsteady to steady state condition which needs to be selected carefully for optimized and long term sustainable performance

different combinations of srt and flux treatment performance at different combinations of srt and flux are presented in table 4 cod removal of more than 90 was observed under all combinations of srt and flux with average cod in effluent less than 20 mg l which was also observed in other mbr studies 5 14 the full scale mbr exhibited high potential for biodegradation and filtration as compared to other conventional treatment processes 16 however there was a slight decline in cod removal efficiency with shorter srts of 15 and 20 days because of relatively lower microbial concentration 5 and may be because of relatively higher eps production 15 although variation in sludge characteristics at different srts was significant there was no major difference in performance of mbr throughout the study period 17 in case of nh4 n nitrification became stable after the sludge recirculation started and removal efficiency remained 99 9 throughout the run regardless of srt and flux and similar effect was observed in another study 15 removal of nh4 n was mostly by biological nitrification in the reactor prior to the membrane filtration process however membrane acts as strong barrier to keep nitrifying microorganisms in the reactor and thus proliferates the autotrophic nitrifiers without any loss indirectly facilitating nitrification 18 average phosphate p was 12 16 mg l in influent and the removal varied from 80 to 85 during the study period slight decrease in removal efficiency was observed with decrease in srt may be because of decrease in paos concentration due to higher wastage of sludge at lower srt the high phosphate p removal may be due to high concentration of biomass in mbr and limited dissolved oxygen the do concentration gradient inside flocs may have played a vital role in removal of phosphate p due to the limited do diffusion and high oxygen consumption by nitrifiers inner portion of flocs exhibit smaller anoxic zones which might have favored the proliferation of phosphates accumulating organisms 19 tss removal was 99 9 throughout the run and turbidity in effluent was 0 4 0 6 ntu which proves that the ultrafiltration uf membrane was very efficient in removal of suspended solids and can be considered as a complete physical barrier for suspended and colloidal solids 5 3 3 sludge characteristics at different combinations of srt and flux 3 3 1 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss biomass concentration reduced with lower srt because of higher sludge wastage rate as shown in fig 5 depicting variation in biomass concentration with changes in srt and flux the biomass concentration was higher initially because of no sludge wastage and complete rejection of suspended solids by membrane fibers the sludge wastage started when mlss reached 10 g l target was to maintain 8 10 g l of mlss in the m tank average mlss during flux of 15 lmh and srt of 80 40 30 20 and 15 days was 10 4 9 5 8 6 8 2 and 7 5 g l respectively while during flux of 20 lmh and srt of 20 days mlss was 9 g l the target mlss 8 10 g l was achieved in all cases except for 15 days srt at 15 lmh flux mlss became stable again to approximately 9 g l in case of 20 days srt and 20 lmh flux it was observed that the membrane tank had more biomass as compared to bio tank s because of complete ss rejection by membrane fibers on the other hand mlvss mlss ratio was found to be better in case of lower srt due to shorter srt relatively more old sludge in endogenous phase is wasted and replaced by new actively growing sludge and thus mlvss mlss ratio improves 3 3 2 capillary suction time cst and sludge volume index svi other sludge characteristics were also measured in term of capillary suction time cst sludge volume index svi particle size distribution psd and extracellular polymeric substances eps cst test is a convenient method of measuring dewaterability of sludge without external source of pressure or suction requirement a large cst usually implies poor sludge dewaterability as reported in table 5 cst was higher for longer srt and lower in case of shorter srt and similar observation was witnessed in another study 15 highest cst was obtained for 80 days srt and 15 lmh flux combination however 15 days srt and 15 lmh flux gave the lowest cst values it may be because at lower srt mlss reduced below 8 g l and as a result cst decreased sludge volume index svi was very high at start up because the bio flocs were loosely aggregated not dense exhibiting slower settling rate after sludge buildup and acclimatization svi starting improving with time as reported in table 5 svi improved with increase in mlss as well as due to sludge flocs maturation with time however svi is not considered an important parameter which affects mbr filtration performance directly however it may be considered vital during the waste sludge handling and treatment stage considering sludge dewaterablity 1 lowest svi was achieved at 15 days srt with 15 lmh flux when the mlss was below 8 g l followed by 20 days srt with 20 lmh flux when mlss was within target range of 8 10 g l in case of longer srt higher biomass concentration and relatively lower food to microorganism f m ratio may have caused the slower settling rate hence selection of an appropriate srt is very important in order to attain effective separation of sludge flocs from treated effluent 20 3 3 3 particle size distribution psd and mean particle size mbr sludge was sonicated for 30 min before analyzing particle size distribution psd as per requirement of the psd analyzer so the psd shown in fig 6 a may not reflect the actual trend of floc sizes in the sludge fig 6 a shows that in case of shortest srt of 15 days distribution curve was skewed exhibiting mbr sludge being composed of high proportion of smaller sized particles moving towards longer srt the curve shifts towards right side representing increase in particle size with increase in srt this trend can also be observed in fig 6 b where proportion of particles having size less than 3 5 μm were found to be more in case of shorter srt these smaller particles play an important role in membrane colloidal fouling in addition to the bio cake development in case of mbr smaller particles tend to cause membrane pore blockage while larger particles may have less effect on membrane fouling because of higher shear induced diffusion 20 the main reason for particle size reduction at shorter srt is the higher hydraulic strain and stress under lower microbial concentration enhancing the floc breakage size of flocs has inverse relationship with hydraulic stress magnitude and duration 18 in our study hrt of 3 h was constant under all combinations of srt and flux and mainly hydraulic stress at lower mlss concentration i e at lower srt may cause smaller particles sizes in the mbr sludge 3 3 4 extracellular polymeric substances eps membrane biofouling depends upon extra cellular polymeric substances eps concentration in the sludge eps are basically polymers of macromolecules which are secreted by microorganisms under different conditions 22 eps has been identified and considered as a major foulant in case of mbr it is attached to flocs as bound eps and also present in supernatant as soluble microbial products smp 21 in this study soluble eps was referred to as smp and bound eps b eps constituting loosely and tightly bound eps variety of substances like lipids carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids are present in eps matrix however sum of proteins and carbohydrates are considered as total eps or smp because of their dominance as compared to other constituents 23 in this study both smp and b eps were analyzed in proteins and carbohydrates form the average smp and b eps during flux of 15 lmh and srt of 80 40 30 20 and 15 days were 69 77 89 101 and 108 mg l respectively and 34 1 40 8 50 3 55 8 and 61 5 mg g mlvss respectively while during last stage of 20 lmh flux and 20 days srt smp and b eps were 123 mg l and 55 7 mg g mlvss respectively as shown in figs 7 and 8 smp and b eps trends show that both types of eps were lower in case of longer srt and vice versa at longer srt f m ratio decreases due to increase in biomass concentration and as a result less food is available to microorganisms under this condition microbial metabolism decreases and higher proportion of microbes move into endogenous respiration phase which ultimately reduces generation of microbial by products and causes lower eps production 17 24 results indicate that p c ratio for smp increased from 1 22 to 1 40 from 80 to 15 days srt for 15 lmh flux and 1 46 in case of 20 days srt and 20 lmh flux p c ratio for b eps showed similar trend however the increase in p c was relatively lower from 1 13 to 1 27 microbial flocs at shorter srt had a relatively higher soluble protein as compared to carbohydrate concentrations carbohydrates are synthesized extracellularly for a specific function while proteins can exist in the extracellular polymer network due to the excretion of intracellular polymers or cell lysis 18 3 4 membrane fouling fig 9 shows that the tmp started from 5 kpa at start up flux of 10 lmh and then raised from 13 0 to 16 7 kpa when flux increased from 10 to 12 lmh tmp further increased from 17 to 19 kpa when flux was raised from 12 to 15 lmh finally when flux was changed to ultimate flux of 20 lmh biggest tmp jump was observed from 45 to 49 kpa all three major jumps in tmp profile are highlighted in fig 9 fouling potential was faster at higher flux because increase in flux reflects increase in organic loading rate olr it was also observed that decrease in srt resulted in higher tmp mainly due to higher eps production in the form of smp as well as b eps as observed in figs 7 and 8 higher eps concentration was also observed at lower srt in another study 21 soluble eps or smp is usually notorious for being the major cause of membrane fouling in water phase 25 another reason for higher tmp for shorter srt could be the reduction in size of bio particles it can be observed from particle size distribution psd results that proportion of smaller particles was higher under shorter srt as compared to longer srt thus higher tmp observed could be due to higher proportion of pore blockage caused by smaller particles in case of lower srt 20 so at srt of 15 days under 15 lmh flux membrane fouling in terms of tmp was severe with combined effect of high eps generation and fine particles in mbr sludge as compared to longer srt of 20 days under 20 lmh flux it can also be observed in tmp profile that tmp became stable for 35 days when 20 days srt and 20 lmh flux was adapted in the last stage of the study membrane filtration finally showed a jump in tmp and entered into irreversible fouling phase completing the total run of 174 days 4 conclusions in this study at mbr start up the nutrients removal performance in terms of ammonium n and phosphate p reached optimal effluent values in the permeate within 3 5 days while optimal cod removal was achieved instantly due to readily biodegradable organic matter in real domestic wastewater complete tss rejection throughout the mbr operation proved the effectiveness of uf hollow fiber membrane as an ultimate physical barrier for suspended solids higher srt favored superior treatment performance resulting in higher concentration of biomass but demonstrated poor sludge settling characteristics in case of lower srt of 15 days treatment performance suffered a bit along with less biomass concentration in reference to target mlss of 8 10 g l cst svi and mean particle size of sludge were observed to be less with shorter sludge age and vice versa tmp steadily increased with step wise increase in membrane flux over the operational period overall higher flux and shorter srt lead to rapid membrane fouling it was also observed that the eps production which is directly related to membrane fouling increased with shorter srt overall 20 days srt with 20 lmh flux proved to be the optimal combination for the full scale mbr plant keeping in view filtration rate treatment performance and sludge characteristics this study infers that at mbr start up flux and srt are very important parameters of a mbr operation from unsteady to steady state condition which needs to be selected carefully for optimized and long term sustainable performance

14377,climate change rapid urbanization industrialization tourism with a huge amount of wastewater discharge means that wastewater reuse has a great potential in turkey and reclamation and reuse is the promising candidate to conserve the valuable fresh water sources the water reuse applications are becoming increasingly a matter of interest in turkey however it is strongly dependent on following factors rapid adaptation of urban wastewater reuse programs the establishment of integrated water resources management framework and guidelines for wastewater reuse programs but on the contrary slow pace of projects unclear or absence of water quality requirements the limited commercial development of reclaimed water and lack of public awareness lack of knowledge about the consequences of untreated or partially treated wastewater discharge into water bodies difficulties in accepted planning procedures and emerging new technologies in real time scale are the main hurdles in the way of water reclamation and reuse this paper aims to give an overview of water reuse activities in turkey and the opportunities and challenges in expanding reclaimed water reuse this review precisely presents the research trends performed in different institutes to meet the wastewater reuse goal along with the wastewater treatment plants currently working in turkey keywords wastewater reclamation wastewater reuse advance wastewater treatment technologies turkey micropollutants 1 introduction water is one of the vital commodities that sustains and nurtures our life on earth yet being super solvent its prone to pollution wastewater recovery integrated management reclamation reuse and recycling can be used as tools for the better management of the water resources and most importantly to attract stakeholders scientists and policy makers into this very important issue over the last three decades the european union and its member states have successively implemented measures to ensure a sustainable water management process a bulk of the water reuse schemes are distributed along coastlines and in the highly urbanized areas of northern and central europe 1 an important initiative of which is the water framework directive wfd eu council directive 1991 2 estimated that in the time span between 1991 when the wfd was issued and 2025 the direct utilization of treated municipal wastewater for reuse in europe has doubled or expected to be increase in future in present times waste water reuse is not a fairy tale countries around the globe like switzerland australia singapore south africa tunisia and cyprus are running most successful wastewater reuse projects at full scale 3 4 some countries have adopted a set of water quality criteria based on the who guidelines 5 6 insufficient fresh water resources to satisfy basic water demands have also lead many countries in middle east like israel saudi arabia qatar and kuwait to launch successful per capita wastewater reuse facilities even saudi arabia treats its 83 of wastewater 7 but some of the countries around mediterranean like turkey italy spain greece cyprus turkey are experiencing fresh water stresses and at the same time difficulties for reuse implementation 8 some of the implementation barriers are described in section 7 activities regarding wastewater treatment and reuse in turkey were initially unveiled by the medaware project funded by euro mediterranean partnership and more specifically by its regional program for local water management 9 10 under task 5 of this project detailed surveys were performed across the country to check and control all the exciting wastewater treatment facilities present in turkey and reported their strengths and weaknesses with the collaboration of different universities and research institutes 11 12 findings of report clearly indicated the poor quality of effluent from wastewater treatment plants not suitable for reuse purposes especially for agriculture with exception of some facilities 12 13 poor water quality and unbalanced distribution of water resources in turkey have compelled most of turkish population on the consumption of bottled water for drinking purposes rapid urbanization industrialization and tourism has polluted water bodies or on the way of polluting them and of course climate change has enhanced the effect 14 thus there is a rapid need of ambitious plans with the help of governmental and private sector to promote wastewater reuse and make that reclaimed water becomes a key element of nationwide water resource management scheme the successful development of wastewater reuse has the close relationships with the installation or upgradation of wastewater treatment plants with the modern treatment facilities able to cope with emerging micropollutants although water scarcity is present with all its seriousness but expensive capital cost along with public acceptance of wastewater reuse are a big hurdle in implementation of reuse projects 15 turkey has somehow wastewater treatment facilities in almost all of its major cities depending upon targeted population but additional treatment of wastewater beyond secondary treatment and installation of pipeline networks for reuse are needed in most of the cities 16 suggested that to promote the implementation of more conscious and sustainable wastewater reuse with the help of modern technologies interest of stakeholders in the whole processes of water reuse operations and integrated water resources management is required 15 the most acceptable and applied wastewater reuse activities around the world are divided into four categories 1 agricultural irrigation 2 aquifer recharge urban recreational and environmental uses 3 process water for industry including cooling and 4 combinations of the above multipurpose schemes 17 so far wastewater reclamation and reuse level in turkey is not high whereas the potential of wastewater reuse is huge present study reviewed wastewater reuse practices in turkey available wastewater treatment facilities research interests and activities performed by different institutes and the opportunities and challenges in expanding reclaimed water reuse was also an objective on which authors touched upon 2 importance of wastewater reuse as 18 predicted with the current rate of water exploitation the global annual water requirements in 2030 would be 6900 billion m3 exceeding more than 64 of total accessible and reliable water source 4200 billion m3 and climate change will worsen the situation 18 the total technically and economically usable surface and ground water potential of turkey is around 112 billion m3 with 96 billion m3 86 coming from rivers located within turkish borders 3 billion m3 3 from external rivers originating outside the country borders and 12 billion m3 11 from groundwater resources water resource potential of turkey is given in table 1 the available amount of water per capita is 1 519 m3 turkey statistical institute tsi has predicted that by 2030 turkey s population will increase to 100 million hence per capita availability of water will drop to 1 120 m3 year 21 14 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc with 21 different models predicts a 12 decrease in annual rainfall in southern europe and the mediterranean basins that could decrease the water potential in turkish rivers also 22 23 ocak et al 24 reported in their study that turkey s annual water withdrawals are expected to exceed 20 of the annual renewable water supply putting country at risk of suffering from water stress in the next decade agriculture sector is taking very few tangible water conservation measures which are not good news for other production sectors like dairy and meat production mdgi millennium development goals indices last reported in 2005 also reported that the overall water resources withdrawn for the country s needs are safely being replenished 25 but on the other hand according to international water management institute turkey is prone to physical water scarcity because more than 60 of river flow and or artesian flow is extracted to full fill country s needs 26 according to the united nations program on water international decade for action 2005 15 around 1 2 billion people live in areas of physical scarcity and 1 6 billion people one quarter of the world s population are facing economic water shortage 27 therefore we can confidently report that considering turkey as a single region with same climatic conditions could falsify assumptions 28 and this is the main reason of confusion for most of the researchers on water stress in the country although turkey generally has an enough water it is not always in the right place at the right time to meet the real needs average annual precipitation evaporation and surface runoff vary greatly 8 considering international water management institute iwmi indicators of water scarcity turkey has little or no water scarcity the expected water demand in 2025 is about 183 percent of the present consumption however local water scarcities do occur in turkey 29 even in recent years also climate change is probably one of the most defining factors affecting agricultural production around the world by producing water imbalance and in case of turkey story is not different although turkey is one of the most water rich countries in the mediterranean due to poor water resource management uneven water resources distribution enormous population increase in recent decades from 28 million in the 1960 s to presently almost 80 million it is now barely water self sufficient and will suffer from water scarcity within the next 5 8 years turkey s use of non renewable groundwater to sustain present irrigation needs has tripled since the 1960 s 24 74 of the total water supply of turkey is used for agricultural irrigation 15 for domestic and the remaining 11 for industrial purposes 30 2 forecasted the impact of climate change on water availability in europe for the 2020 s and 2070 s with the help of a model and concluded that some river basins of turkey must cope with 10 reduced water availability similarly turkey projected reuse potential which is supposed to triple or even grow six fold compared to today reaching a maximum of 2000 mm3 y primarily caused by a combined effect of high irrigation demand and reduced water availability 2 3 water reclamation recycling and reuse status of turkey water reclamation often refers to the treatment of storm water industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater for beneficial reuse 31 wastewater treatment plants use conventional treatment methods like coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration disinfection and ozonation advance treatment facilities 32 33 however conventional water treatment plants are only able to remove either some or none of the emerging pollutants micropollutants from the water like toxins pesticides pharmaceutical residues arsenic and herbicides 33 34 35 turkey s conventional wastewater treatment plants are present all along the country but because of water quality it cannot be used for reuse purposes especially in which the close human contact is involved as in the case of istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world previously primary treatment was favored but now some of the plants own biological treatment units followed by advance treatment units to minimize and control nutrient levels n and p to meet the receiving water standards most of the plants serve to population over 100 000 but some plants face operational problems such as lack of automation clogging of pipes old fashioned equipment and working over capacities the water and sewerage administration of istanbul iski has to supply high quality drinking water to the inhabitants of the city and is responsible for the treatment of the urban wastewater 36 it is clear for turkey that none of wastewater treatment facility was constructed for reuse initially ministry of environment and urban development turkey has prepared an action plan for wastewater treatment for the years of 2015 2023 based on a previous action plan that was prepared for the year 2008 2012 37 for the assessment of water quality and quantity in the river basins of turkey modeling techniques and some important parameters like cod nh4 n no3 n and tp level of organic and inorganic pollution were emphasized in the action plan there are 81 cities in turkey where governors act as representatives of the central government sixteen of these cities are greater metropolitan cities whose municipalities can solve their problems with their own budget 36 provincial bank general directorate of turkey is responsible for tendering designing and construction of wastewater treatment plants similarly municipalities are responsible for operation and maintenance of wwtps conventional activated sludge system was common in the 1990s but after 2005 construction of the biological facilities for nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become widespread the most common wastewater treatment methods applied in turkey are pre treatment mechanical primary treatment biological secondary and advanced treatment including coarse grid pumping stations fine screening grit and grease removal primary settling tanks aeration tanks and final sedimentation tanks activated sludge system collection of urban wastewater and then its discharge in purified form according to applied standards comes in the responsibility of municipalities by appropriate disposal methods among the present 597wastewater treatment facilities 303 holds secondary treatment 13 have physical primary treatment physicochemical treatment 40 are equipped with deep sea discharge techniques 40 small scale treatment plants comprises of small units like local mbrs while 124 and 77 units have natural treatment process phytoremediation constructed wetlands lagoons and pond systems and advance treatment reverse osmosis respectively approximately 14 million m3 of wastewater are treated at facilities in the current situation with different treatment configurations 37 however for reuse purposes in some plants sand filters after the final sedimentation tank disinfection unit especially ultraviolet rays is added in recent years instead of conventional treatment processes use of membrane processes mbr and disinfection unit is also considered in some cases like in case of muğla and antalya gazipaşa konacik municipal wwtp plants details of working wastewater treatment facilities are present in table 2 after disinfection with ultraviolet rays treated wastewater can be reused for different purposes advanced treatment for the removal of pesticides such as oxidation with ozone and filtration by granular activated carbon gac has been considered effective but problems related to the process are still there like saturation of the activated carbon and the formation of toxic chemical by products which may develop in the advance oxidation processes 38 39 so basically in turkey generally three main types of treatment plant were used stabilization ponds for small communities 20 000 persons trickling filter for mid sized community and activated sludge or extended aerated activated sludge for a large scale community 40 37 according to ministry of science industry and technology there are 279 organized industrial zones oiz in turkey 41 laws and regulations regarding the use of treated wastewater as irrigation water were presented in technical notification on wastewater treatment plant procedures no 27527 dated march 20 2010 in annex 7 42 same notification provides guidelines for the reuse of treated wastewater in industrial processes industrial cooling along with some examples of practical applications of the action plan regarding reuse of treated industrial wastewater back in industries in the cities of istanbul konya and muğla previously these regulations were published in turkish water pollution control regulation technical aspects bulletin reference no 20748 1991 43 in action plan for wastewater treatment 2015 2023 37 emphasis was laid on the point that existing wastewater treatment plants should be modified for reuse of wastewater according to the needs and new wastewater treatment plants should be planned considering reuse facilities there are several public institutions organizations like ministry of environment and urban development forestry and water affairs ministry of culture and tourism and other municipalities and special provincial administrations that invest into environmental infrastructure projects using national resources between the years of 2009 and 2013 relevant ministries invested 4 812 449 067 tl approximately 1 632 556 260 us on construction and maintenance of sewage and wastewater treatment plants 37 description of types of treatment plants and schemes most common in turkey are given in table 3 4 wastewater treatment methods effective for reuse and current research trends in turkey several traditional water treatment plants and techniques are present nowadays in turkey high quality effluent requires water treatment shift from less developed methods toward advance methods costs will increase proportionally similarly highly polluted water requires high cost for treatment 44 levels of wastewater treatment along with their names and potential uses are represented in detailed yet simplified way in fig 1 for the years 2007 2023 eu integrated environmental strategy nes has been prepared in order to ensure turkey s sustainable economic and social development numerous aspects regarding potential reuse and the associated wastewater treatment process continue to be the object of research and innovation in turkey improvement of treatment facilities development of smart technologies and reduction in energy consumption are just some of the issues to be supported in this area to ensure the active participation of the whole society in decision making a collaborated setup has been established between public environmental protection activities private sector civil society organizations in close cooperation with academia 46 a review has presented in table 4 in which research conducted by different academic groups in turkey on the selection of wastewater treatment technology effective enough to remove generalized pollutants along with emerging micropollutants are discussed with the purpose of making wastewater reusable and recyclable opportunities and challenges are also presented that lead us to draw this conclusion that most of the scientists are interested in membrane technology and other advance treatment methods with the aim of wastewater reuse however challenges are there for the selection and construction of treatment trains or schemes to treat wastewater is highly dependent on the quality type of wastewater to be reclaimed along with other multiple factors like population size area available cost and political social acceptance more advanced techniques could be added at any stage of conventional treatment schemes according to the type of pollutants in water and discharge standards for reuse purposes as a consequence the eu directives discharge limits should be the starting point for further treatment of municipal wastewater for reuse it is to be noted that standard or typical schemes have their own strengths and weaknesses weaknesses have driven the use of membrane technology which is multifunctional and cost effective one of the innovating technologies is direct membrane filtration dmf of raw wastewater this is a purely physical process by which particles including microorganisms are removed from the wastewater by membrane filtration uf to remove large particles from the wastewater simple pre treatments such as screening sedimentation or dissolved air flotation daf can be applied the effluent of this process is particle free water rich in dissolved components nutrients possible applications of this new concept can be found in agriculture dmf is investigated in several places including turkey other innovating technologies are advanced oxidation processes these processes become more and more important since substances such as pesticides endocrine disrupters etc are given priority 82 5 wastewater reuse opportunities turkey is defined by economists and political scientists as one of the world s newly industrialized countries with gdp per sector agriculture 8 1 industry 27 7 services 64 2 83 generally central wastewater recovery applications are more common in turkey however individual applications household and on site sewage recycling grey water recycling applications are also available and can be intensified 84 selection of wastewater treatment method depends on many socio economic factors for instance the application features location terrain availability of water resources cultural norms and religious believes likewise planning of local authorities waste recycling policies and regulations is also important along with public awareness increased need of water has grown interest of people in water reuse in some areas but modification of existing wastewater treatment plants and construction of new wastewater treatment plants considering re use facilities should be the priority it is a great opportunity to apply advanced current technologies in wastewater treatment and reuse such as ultraviolet radiation oxidation processes maturation ponds membrane filtration and electrochemical treatment to remove effectively the pollutants including salinity pathogens heavy metals and emerging contaminants 85 in future with government involvement in establishing policies regulations and stakeholder s involvement can bring a boast in waste water reuse in turkey along with the revenue generation some of the opportunities that are important for future perspective and that can initiate reclaimed water use efforts in turkey are explained in following sections 5 1 wastewater reuse in agriculture agriculture plays a very important role in turkish economy but reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation has not been considered consciously till now as the country has not yet experienced severe water shortages 6 but significantly high benefits of wastewater reuse have been observed throughout the world both in terms of economics and agriculture sustainability 9 in 2000 42 km3 of water consumed was used for irrigation purposes 86 agricultural water use is not only the largest consumer of water in country 74 but also the greatest consumer of funds allocated for water resources projects 30 however irrigated lands are polluted and deteriorated quickly by improper culture and irrigation practices 8 presently the largest water consuming sector is agriculture which made up 65 70 of the global water demand 87 88 world bank in 2010 reported about one tenth of the global crops was irrigated with sewage unfortunately in which only 10 was properly treated although treated wastewater could supplement necessary nutrients for plants but the existence of emerging pollutants such as phthalates polychlorobiphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pharmaceutical compounds and personal care products 89 is a new growing concern turkey has approved its irrigation water quality standards in 1991 in the form of turkish water pollution control regulations also covering five quality classifications on the bases of water quality required for specific agricultural land and constraints on heavy metal and other toxic compounds concentrations generally adopted from who guidelines 43 another updated version of laws and regulations regarding the use of treated wastewater as irrigation water and industrial cooling processes was published in annex 7 technical notification procedures no 27527 dated march 20 2010 according to the regulations treated wastewater can be used in irrigation after getting a written statement issued by the concerned governmental organizations provincial banks agriculture ministry and environment and forest ministry will decide whether the effluent can be reused in irrigation or not 90 reuse of treated wastewater in some cities are given in table 2 37 of treated waste water that is discharged in to nearby creeks and rivers are reused for direct effluent directly used irrigation or indirect reuse through a receiving body agricultural uses in arid areas in which irrigation activities should be increased for crop production direct irrigation is experienced 10 9 currently effluents of uwwps urban wastewater treatment plants are not suitable for agricultural irrigation purposes because some of the uwwtps do not even have disinfection units as their final polishing treatment stage likewise organic micropollutants are another modern threat for open waters it has been observed that despite of the all the efforts to produce high quality wastewater treatment satisfactory and efficient operation is rarely achieved due to their high energy consumption and disinfecting chemicals requirements 5 2 urbanization some researchers think that the main reason of water crisis is the increasing water resource demand caused by urbanization and economical boast 91 urbanization process in the world began with industrial revolution and accelerated with globalization urbanization degree may be statistically derived from many loosely connected properties as described in detail by 92 such as land use type changes land cover construction activities motor driven vehicles registration energy consumption population and so on urbanization is defined as urban scale expanding due to populations transferring in search of better standards of life and the gathering of secondary and tertiary industries from rural to urban areas 85 turkey ranks number 18 in the list of countries by population with 75 837 020 people as of july 1 2014 records turkey s population is equivalent to 1 05 of the total world s population the population density in turkey is 97 people per km2 93 the studies on urbanization process in turkey were conducted mostly in 1970s and 80s there have not been any extensive studies after 80 s except the studies conducted by state planning organization spo to find out development levels of cities and provinces according to an estimate in 2007 67 5 population was living in cities and this percentage increased to 72 3 in the year 2012 the jurisdictions on administrative status change of cities are performed by head quarter of provincial administration in the ministry of internal affairs the changes are made possible via regulations or directives based on article 126 of the constitution 94 depending on these regulations or directives there have been changes in the number of cities from 1920 to 2009 currently with 81 cities 36 as shown in table 5 it is not obvious that the current water resource carrying capacity of turkey can support the rapid urbanization and economic development or not but it s clear that rapid urbanization can stimulate water resource use efficiency by implementing wastewater reuse 96 for example istanbul and ankara wastewater reclamation and reuse are now recognized as key components of water and wastewater management by urban managers many cities municipalities are now putting forward the plans of wastewater reuse 5 3 water stress and climate change water is the fundamental medium that transfers the effects of climate change to the ecology and human beings as stated by united nations water 97 increased global mean surface temperature 0 3 0 7 c for the years 2016 2035 and rise in sea level rise about 0 2 0 6 m by the year 2100 is reported 98 99 to adapt to more intensified climatic change intensified future planning is required especially for rapidly developing economies and urbanization 100 in order to the provide adequate ecosystem services 101 climate change reports forecast considerably reduced availabilities for many south european river basins the eurowasser model 102 has forecasted the impact of climate change on water availability in europe according to two different global circulation models for the time horizons 2020s and 2070s their calculations indicated river basins will have heavily reduced water availability decreases of more than 10 are projected for some continental countries poland hungary and south eastern countries bulgaria romania parts of turkey whereas most south european countries will experience reductions of 25 and more 103 unal et al 104 reported in their elaborated study about precipitation in turkey with the help of different models and tests in space and time they noticed complex temporal structure and spatial variations in dry and wet season because of which an obvious decrease in annual precipitation throughout anatolia including west and southwest sections whereas increased annual precipitation trends in northeast black sea region of turkey were observed turkey is the largest country in the eastern mediterranean 105 therefore in another study önol and unal 28 divided turkey into 7 homogeneous climate regions to understand its climatic variations they have concluded that precipitation results in future simulation reveal that precipitation in all seasons and in almost all regions decreases except for the autumn season in the future simulation warming over climatic regions is in the range of 2 5 c summer warming over western regions of turkey is 3 c higher than the winter warming during winter in the future simulation precipitation decreases very significantly over southeastern turkey 24 which covers most of the upstream of euphrates and tigris river basin this projected decrease could be a major source of concern for turkey and the neighboring countries 28 decreasing wet dry season precipitation and increasing temperatures throughout the country except northeast coasts and eastern parts of turkey is expected to have a strong impact on the economic livelihood of the region especially on agricultural production drinking water supply and hydroelectricity production 104 under the influence of climate change alternate water source like recycling water should be viewed as a necessity not an option indeed the opportunities and threats posed by the climate change for the water reclamation industry were interwoven 45 climate change triggers market with higher willingness on the use of reclaimed water and modern technology for treatment plants but unfortunately to date climate change impacts have hardly been studied thoroughly as not a single study is present reporting the influence of the climatic factors on water shortages and wastewater treatment and reuse potentials 5 4 wastewater reuse market various methods such as life cycle assessment lca and cost benefit analyses exist to quantify the costs of water services economic considerations for environment based projects like internal monetary units and external impacts nontangible are therefore of high importance 106 107 such as for water reuse 108 it is a common observation that a series of activities about the advantages of wastewater regeneration and reuse are often presented without supporting economic quantification 109 reported a great feasibility of water reuse projects undertaking a cost benefit analysis of water reuse projects incorporating all parameters including economic valuation environmental externalities and resource availability the reclaimed water is perceived as a part of total urban water management and received similar subsidy like other water services 44 the global municipal wastewater flow rate was estimated about 680 960 million m3 per day only a small fraction 4 equivalent to 32 million m3 was reclaimed in 2010 110 with an increasing demand on resource saving the quantity of recycled wastewater was expected to jump to 55 million m3 in 2015 111 developing countries normally accompanied with water constrained conditions tries to adapt gradually the world health organization who guidelines for more flexible approaches as targets for wastewater reuse have been clearly regulated in the official documents furthermore the playing ground in the water supply sector is more open to private companies 112 and they act as a monopoly of governmental organizations in most of the countries but in case of turkey key actors of the total water management is still the local governmental water authorities there is a huge tendency of socializing the water supply industry to share the financial burden of the governments 31 private sectors could participate in the process by delivering professional service packages as in public private partnerships ppps models 111 water management authorities and companies should not only consider the benefits of market value but also environmental benefits or the increase in the availability of a scarce resource 5 5 ground water exploitation groundwater resources are often exploited unsustainably with abstractions exceeding the recharge rate that leads towards over exploitation of the water resource the exploitation rate exceeds 50 in turkey syria lebanon the west bank algeria and morocco 113 excessive water abstraction can cause secondary effects in negatively affecting water quality in addition groundwater resources are polluted by insufficiently treated municipal wastewater and uncontrolled industrial pollution and more and more aquifers are lost for direct drinking water supply due to diffused pollution in case of turkey as per 2012 data about 4 9 billion m3 of water was drawn from different resources for drinking and domestic purposes by municipalities 48 9 of water was taken from dams 28 3 of the water was drawn from wells 19 2 from lakes and 2 and 1 6 from ponds and sea respectively according to data provided by turkey statistical institute in 2012 about 216 liters of water per person per day was provided by the municipal water supply networks similarly amount of water available per person in three major cities istanbul ankara and izmir was found to be 186 217 and 223 liters respectively tsi 2012 another considerable reason for high use of groundwater is for the agricultural purposes and the driving force is low prices of irrigation water pricing of irrigation water is based on land area but water fees should be regulated according to the volumetric water consumption 8 5 6 tourisms in aegean and mediterranean regions where touristic facilities are concentrated need of treatment plants has developed overtime in residential areas these effluents are used for garden and park irrigation and also in some places wastewater collected in the stabilization ponds is used for agricultural purposes 114 it is estimated that over 2000 small scale package plants exist in turkey for tourist settlements serving for populations between 20 and 800 persons and 75 of these serve for between 50 and 400 persons 115 9 for example in antalya being the center of tourism in south anatolia 14 urban wastewater treatment plants are in operation followed by istanbul greater metropolitan city that has 13 urban wastewater treatment plants and another 6 plants in the highly industrialized province kocaeli i e in the vicinity of istanbul 9 but recently number of wastewater treatment facilities has been increased as shown in table 2 and even number will increase in coming years along with the upgradation of already present facilities for reuse purposes 5 7 environmental protection and restoration an increasing number of countries have produced legislative framework for the safe use of treated municipal wastewater the legislative framework can be broken down into two types regulations and guidelines regulations are legally adopted enforceable and mandatory while guidelines are advisory voluntary and non enforceable but can be incorporated in treated wastewater reuse permits and in this way become enforceable requirements like who and national organizations of federal governments epa and australia which can then be used as a resource by states that have limited or no regulations or guidelines which offers guidelines and frameworks regarding methods of reuse treatment methods microbiological constituents chemical constituents physical properties monitoring and communication strategies compliance of new and existing environmental regulations and stricter pollution limit values also contribute towards the environmental protection and restoration turkey being having a diverse ecosystem aquatic and terrestrial has a great opportunity to develop its rules laws and regulation for wastewater treatment and its disposal for example the use of adequately treated wastewater for appropriate applications e g for irrigation or industrial cooling processes instead of abstracting river water can reduce or even cease the amount of wastewater discharged to water bodies thereby leading to compliance with water quality legislation this will not only minimize the water pollution but will also decrease the potential risk of micropollutants and growing bacterial resistance in water ecosystems the restoration and enhancement of natural habitats such as wetlands their creation for environmental and recreational purposes can also be considered as emerging drivers for treated wastewater reuse in turkey 6 wastewater reuse challenges discharge of untreated or partially treated municipal wastewater into surface water contamination of groundwater resulting from sewer systems leaks and open dumping of solid waste occurrence of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in soil and irrigation canals that ends up in ocean aquifers and surface water inadequate incorrect agricultural practices rapid erosions and sedimentation of natural lakes and dams due to deforestation are the biggest reasons of water deformation in turkey some of the practical concerns are given in table 6 which are also reported by other researchers 3 6 1 social perception acceptance of wastewater reuse the most critical factor determining the sustainability of the reclamation scheme is not lying on the technology itself but rather on public acceptance 116 the ratio of people willing to use recycled water for non potable purposes not surprisingly overweighed those for drinking purposes reported in many studies around the world 117 118 119 120 121 122 a greater support of reclaimed wastewater for agriculture public utilities and low contact purposes was well recognized 123 whereas most of objections fell into projects with human close contact therefore buyukkamaci and alkan 117 conducted a survey designed to increase public awareness and to determine the potential for acceptance of wastewater reuse applications in turkey respondents felt that treated wastewater reuse for applications not involving close personal contact was acceptable due to health risk concerns on the other hand the cost of reclaimed water was another major public concern in turkey most respondents have a positive conception for reuse alternatives of toilet flushing 64 cleaning roads 63 use in construction 63 and use in fire extinguish systems 58 117 however in the case of direct human contact with treated water a majority opposed treated water uses most of the participants do not support the use of reclaimed water for the preparation of canned vegetables and other foods and drinking purposes less or minimal acceptance towards reuse of wastewater could be because of religious and cultural taboos friedler et al 124 reported cost saving 71 positive outcomes on the environment 36 and saving potable water 34 as advantages for a household climate change has changed the public perception about wastewater reclamation and reuse not only for agriculture but also for their household usage for instance over 78 of local residents in switzerland perceived long term changes in precipitation and or temperature and experienced its effects on the urban drainage and wastewater system in recent years 125 the fact is success of advocating a wastewater reuse scheme depends greatly on the adopted communicative strategy and transparency of information 126 promoting a voluntary spirit bottom up where people familiarized themselves with recycled water would result in a higher support than applying compulsory measures top down dolnicar et al 126 and hurlimann 127 believed that if people involved their senses with reclaimed water they tended to accept recycled water for close to personal use trust on water authorities to ensure water quality and quantity will proportionally increase gradually therefore a water reclamation project must utilize the mass media and larger communities for communicating scientific information about its benefits and risks to maximize the public understanding on water reuse 116 6 2 lack of framework of guidelines for safe treated wastewater reuse in order to reduce the environmental and health impacts of wastewater reuse countries have adopted several standards and guidelines that differ from each other even at the regional level practice of wastewater reuse mainly depends on a country s economy infrastructural status covering wastewater treatment capacity and capability educational level climate water supply balance between water requirement and demand intensity of agricultural activities population social habits like cultural and religious prejudice and many other factors 128 in turkey ministry of environment has been established as the authority and administrative structure to identify and achieve the goals of the national environmental policy in 1991 in 2003 after collaboration with the ministry of forestry it has continued to operate as the ministry of environment and forests water amendment and determination of policies related to waste management were made in 2011 and for this purpose ministry of environment and urban development comes together with ministry of forestry and water affairs turkey has very limited regulations of wastewater reuse for agricultural purposes with many loop holes the regulation has many technical limitations for recycling wastewater in terms of treatment methods and suitability of industrial treated wastewaters to be used for irrigation 129 recently limited regulations that determine the discharge standards and appropriate sanctions were made in order to protect and improve water quality control of pollution sources purifying the contaminated water and wastewater re safe use by ministry of environment and urban planning organization official gazette 04 07 2011 no 27984 and environmental law article 29 will be followed in accordance with the wastewater treatment plant utilization of incentive measures for the regulation on principles and procedures official gazette 01 10 2010 no 27716 page 111 130 131 42 in addition objective of the master plan is to satisfy standards of eu urban wastewater treatment directive 132 for the discharges into sensitive zones starting from 2010 discharge limits for preliminary and pretreatment of wastewater defined in water pollution control regulation 133 are bod5 45 mg l ss 30 mg l and microbial quality total coliform concentrations will be less than 1000 100 ml and fecal coliform will be less than 200 100 ml in the 90 of water body samples on the other hand there are no legislative regulations at the european level concerning wastewater reuse so far apart from the urban wastewater treatment directive 91 271 eec which advises to reuse wastewater whenever appropriate 132 134 135 however an updated complete set of guidelines are present for water reuse published by us epa 136 6 3 human health risk the probability of infection associated with reclaimed water and wastewater reuse has been reported by different studies separately according to the types of wastewater like conventionally treated wastewater storm wastewater grey water and rain water 137 138 139 140 141 risk from various pathogens viral bacterial parasitic protozoan and helminths and chemicals pharmaceuticals disinfection byproducts pesticides metals etc when ingested inhaled or absorbed through the skin cannot be ignored these pathogens and chemicals may cause a range of health outcomes from acute illness to chronic diseases and mortality if found in reclaimed water 31 if the emphasis is put on a maximum risk reduction independently of the costs associated to the treatments then the standards are usually restrictive and cost of projects will be high on the contrary if the emphasis is on an acceptable risk level the standards are not so important but are combined with other tools like lca and cost benefit analysis 3 in this case costs could be affordable 7 conclusion in this paper a wide range of documents has been analyzed to provide a synthetic outlook and update on wastewater treatment reuse opportunities and constraints policy makers academia national and international firms are aware of the potential benefits in the field of wastewater reuse but lack of public interest and negligence of implementing authorities may leading efforts in vain this scenario is perhaps not unique to turkey instead all developing countries have such challenges many wastewater treatment facilities are equipped with water reuse system but reclaimed water is not efficiently reused in other most of the cases there is a good opportunity to build new units or update exciting treatment units with new emerging techniques as per the needs of growing population although turkish government have many long term and short term plans for installation of wwtps in all parts of country but the institutions need to clarify that the available methods related to the specific water use should be made available including reuse for aquaculture the reuse for wetland development as well as the reuse of treated grey water treated excreta and treated sewage sludge in agriculture responsible ministries and agencies should have an additional department for problem identification and implementation of solutions according to the expected degree of pollution technology solutions should be proposed by taking care of microbiological constituents chemical constituents and physical parameters of wastewater as the existing wastewater treatment plants must overcome their deficiencies in terms of micropollutants removal by the installation or upgradation to advance treatment methodologies this whole process can be assured by the availability of best technicians academicians engineers and workers to regulate wastewater treatment plants to minimize extent of errors appropriate monitoring criteria should be selected for monitoring of wastewater on regular basis not only to ensure best result of the treatment but also results should be publish for general population to win the public confidence the reference framework of guidelines for the safe use of treated wastewater should integrate the impacts and pressure of extensive international tourism and transboundary river basins check that can be the hurdle in implementation of reuse plan likewise formation of wastewater reuse guidelines or regulations should involve proper public involvement may be with the help of print and soft media reuse of wastewater in agricultural production has a lot of benefits and is a very important subject to be regulated in a separate more field based standard guideline for irrigation country should formulate its own strict regulations according to the needs of economy and better production in turkey determining the wastewater treatment needs and afterward associated benefits are not yet well understood the marketing of recycled wastewater engineering evaluations and cost analysis of alternatives in terms of economics steps to be followed in the planning of facilities for wastewater recycling and reuse are still insufficient for future recommendations first step should be the primary data collection from each city to understand the level and type of water pollution then by involving academic institutes a proper technical solution could be found presently without any proper collaboration between private and government institutes most of the research activities went in vain as when government will allow private sector to jump in they will come up with implementable solutions second important future recommendation is to integrate the risk of climate change into the national action plan complete understanding of climate changes that turkey is going to face in near future or is facing on this very day will speed up water reuse work and aims and will lead to new policies and regulations acknowledgment we would like to acknowledge the scientific and technological research council of turkey s tübi̇tak 2215 program for supporting international students in their research activities 
14377,climate change rapid urbanization industrialization tourism with a huge amount of wastewater discharge means that wastewater reuse has a great potential in turkey and reclamation and reuse is the promising candidate to conserve the valuable fresh water sources the water reuse applications are becoming increasingly a matter of interest in turkey however it is strongly dependent on following factors rapid adaptation of urban wastewater reuse programs the establishment of integrated water resources management framework and guidelines for wastewater reuse programs but on the contrary slow pace of projects unclear or absence of water quality requirements the limited commercial development of reclaimed water and lack of public awareness lack of knowledge about the consequences of untreated or partially treated wastewater discharge into water bodies difficulties in accepted planning procedures and emerging new technologies in real time scale are the main hurdles in the way of water reclamation and reuse this paper aims to give an overview of water reuse activities in turkey and the opportunities and challenges in expanding reclaimed water reuse this review precisely presents the research trends performed in different institutes to meet the wastewater reuse goal along with the wastewater treatment plants currently working in turkey keywords wastewater reclamation wastewater reuse advance wastewater treatment technologies turkey micropollutants 1 introduction water is one of the vital commodities that sustains and nurtures our life on earth yet being super solvent its prone to pollution wastewater recovery integrated management reclamation reuse and recycling can be used as tools for the better management of the water resources and most importantly to attract stakeholders scientists and policy makers into this very important issue over the last three decades the european union and its member states have successively implemented measures to ensure a sustainable water management process a bulk of the water reuse schemes are distributed along coastlines and in the highly urbanized areas of northern and central europe 1 an important initiative of which is the water framework directive wfd eu council directive 1991 2 estimated that in the time span between 1991 when the wfd was issued and 2025 the direct utilization of treated municipal wastewater for reuse in europe has doubled or expected to be increase in future in present times waste water reuse is not a fairy tale countries around the globe like switzerland australia singapore south africa tunisia and cyprus are running most successful wastewater reuse projects at full scale 3 4 some countries have adopted a set of water quality criteria based on the who guidelines 5 6 insufficient fresh water resources to satisfy basic water demands have also lead many countries in middle east like israel saudi arabia qatar and kuwait to launch successful per capita wastewater reuse facilities even saudi arabia treats its 83 of wastewater 7 but some of the countries around mediterranean like turkey italy spain greece cyprus turkey are experiencing fresh water stresses and at the same time difficulties for reuse implementation 8 some of the implementation barriers are described in section 7 activities regarding wastewater treatment and reuse in turkey were initially unveiled by the medaware project funded by euro mediterranean partnership and more specifically by its regional program for local water management 9 10 under task 5 of this project detailed surveys were performed across the country to check and control all the exciting wastewater treatment facilities present in turkey and reported their strengths and weaknesses with the collaboration of different universities and research institutes 11 12 findings of report clearly indicated the poor quality of effluent from wastewater treatment plants not suitable for reuse purposes especially for agriculture with exception of some facilities 12 13 poor water quality and unbalanced distribution of water resources in turkey have compelled most of turkish population on the consumption of bottled water for drinking purposes rapid urbanization industrialization and tourism has polluted water bodies or on the way of polluting them and of course climate change has enhanced the effect 14 thus there is a rapid need of ambitious plans with the help of governmental and private sector to promote wastewater reuse and make that reclaimed water becomes a key element of nationwide water resource management scheme the successful development of wastewater reuse has the close relationships with the installation or upgradation of wastewater treatment plants with the modern treatment facilities able to cope with emerging micropollutants although water scarcity is present with all its seriousness but expensive capital cost along with public acceptance of wastewater reuse are a big hurdle in implementation of reuse projects 15 turkey has somehow wastewater treatment facilities in almost all of its major cities depending upon targeted population but additional treatment of wastewater beyond secondary treatment and installation of pipeline networks for reuse are needed in most of the cities 16 suggested that to promote the implementation of more conscious and sustainable wastewater reuse with the help of modern technologies interest of stakeholders in the whole processes of water reuse operations and integrated water resources management is required 15 the most acceptable and applied wastewater reuse activities around the world are divided into four categories 1 agricultural irrigation 2 aquifer recharge urban recreational and environmental uses 3 process water for industry including cooling and 4 combinations of the above multipurpose schemes 17 so far wastewater reclamation and reuse level in turkey is not high whereas the potential of wastewater reuse is huge present study reviewed wastewater reuse practices in turkey available wastewater treatment facilities research interests and activities performed by different institutes and the opportunities and challenges in expanding reclaimed water reuse was also an objective on which authors touched upon 2 importance of wastewater reuse as 18 predicted with the current rate of water exploitation the global annual water requirements in 2030 would be 6900 billion m3 exceeding more than 64 of total accessible and reliable water source 4200 billion m3 and climate change will worsen the situation 18 the total technically and economically usable surface and ground water potential of turkey is around 112 billion m3 with 96 billion m3 86 coming from rivers located within turkish borders 3 billion m3 3 from external rivers originating outside the country borders and 12 billion m3 11 from groundwater resources water resource potential of turkey is given in table 1 the available amount of water per capita is 1 519 m3 turkey statistical institute tsi has predicted that by 2030 turkey s population will increase to 100 million hence per capita availability of water will drop to 1 120 m3 year 21 14 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc with 21 different models predicts a 12 decrease in annual rainfall in southern europe and the mediterranean basins that could decrease the water potential in turkish rivers also 22 23 ocak et al 24 reported in their study that turkey s annual water withdrawals are expected to exceed 20 of the annual renewable water supply putting country at risk of suffering from water stress in the next decade agriculture sector is taking very few tangible water conservation measures which are not good news for other production sectors like dairy and meat production mdgi millennium development goals indices last reported in 2005 also reported that the overall water resources withdrawn for the country s needs are safely being replenished 25 but on the other hand according to international water management institute turkey is prone to physical water scarcity because more than 60 of river flow and or artesian flow is extracted to full fill country s needs 26 according to the united nations program on water international decade for action 2005 15 around 1 2 billion people live in areas of physical scarcity and 1 6 billion people one quarter of the world s population are facing economic water shortage 27 therefore we can confidently report that considering turkey as a single region with same climatic conditions could falsify assumptions 28 and this is the main reason of confusion for most of the researchers on water stress in the country although turkey generally has an enough water it is not always in the right place at the right time to meet the real needs average annual precipitation evaporation and surface runoff vary greatly 8 considering international water management institute iwmi indicators of water scarcity turkey has little or no water scarcity the expected water demand in 2025 is about 183 percent of the present consumption however local water scarcities do occur in turkey 29 even in recent years also climate change is probably one of the most defining factors affecting agricultural production around the world by producing water imbalance and in case of turkey story is not different although turkey is one of the most water rich countries in the mediterranean due to poor water resource management uneven water resources distribution enormous population increase in recent decades from 28 million in the 1960 s to presently almost 80 million it is now barely water self sufficient and will suffer from water scarcity within the next 5 8 years turkey s use of non renewable groundwater to sustain present irrigation needs has tripled since the 1960 s 24 74 of the total water supply of turkey is used for agricultural irrigation 15 for domestic and the remaining 11 for industrial purposes 30 2 forecasted the impact of climate change on water availability in europe for the 2020 s and 2070 s with the help of a model and concluded that some river basins of turkey must cope with 10 reduced water availability similarly turkey projected reuse potential which is supposed to triple or even grow six fold compared to today reaching a maximum of 2000 mm3 y primarily caused by a combined effect of high irrigation demand and reduced water availability 2 3 water reclamation recycling and reuse status of turkey water reclamation often refers to the treatment of storm water industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater for beneficial reuse 31 wastewater treatment plants use conventional treatment methods like coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration disinfection and ozonation advance treatment facilities 32 33 however conventional water treatment plants are only able to remove either some or none of the emerging pollutants micropollutants from the water like toxins pesticides pharmaceutical residues arsenic and herbicides 33 34 35 turkey s conventional wastewater treatment plants are present all along the country but because of water quality it cannot be used for reuse purposes especially in which the close human contact is involved as in the case of istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world previously primary treatment was favored but now some of the plants own biological treatment units followed by advance treatment units to minimize and control nutrient levels n and p to meet the receiving water standards most of the plants serve to population over 100 000 but some plants face operational problems such as lack of automation clogging of pipes old fashioned equipment and working over capacities the water and sewerage administration of istanbul iski has to supply high quality drinking water to the inhabitants of the city and is responsible for the treatment of the urban wastewater 36 it is clear for turkey that none of wastewater treatment facility was constructed for reuse initially ministry of environment and urban development turkey has prepared an action plan for wastewater treatment for the years of 2015 2023 based on a previous action plan that was prepared for the year 2008 2012 37 for the assessment of water quality and quantity in the river basins of turkey modeling techniques and some important parameters like cod nh4 n no3 n and tp level of organic and inorganic pollution were emphasized in the action plan there are 81 cities in turkey where governors act as representatives of the central government sixteen of these cities are greater metropolitan cities whose municipalities can solve their problems with their own budget 36 provincial bank general directorate of turkey is responsible for tendering designing and construction of wastewater treatment plants similarly municipalities are responsible for operation and maintenance of wwtps conventional activated sludge system was common in the 1990s but after 2005 construction of the biological facilities for nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become widespread the most common wastewater treatment methods applied in turkey are pre treatment mechanical primary treatment biological secondary and advanced treatment including coarse grid pumping stations fine screening grit and grease removal primary settling tanks aeration tanks and final sedimentation tanks activated sludge system collection of urban wastewater and then its discharge in purified form according to applied standards comes in the responsibility of municipalities by appropriate disposal methods among the present 597wastewater treatment facilities 303 holds secondary treatment 13 have physical primary treatment physicochemical treatment 40 are equipped with deep sea discharge techniques 40 small scale treatment plants comprises of small units like local mbrs while 124 and 77 units have natural treatment process phytoremediation constructed wetlands lagoons and pond systems and advance treatment reverse osmosis respectively approximately 14 million m3 of wastewater are treated at facilities in the current situation with different treatment configurations 37 however for reuse purposes in some plants sand filters after the final sedimentation tank disinfection unit especially ultraviolet rays is added in recent years instead of conventional treatment processes use of membrane processes mbr and disinfection unit is also considered in some cases like in case of muğla and antalya gazipaşa konacik municipal wwtp plants details of working wastewater treatment facilities are present in table 2 after disinfection with ultraviolet rays treated wastewater can be reused for different purposes advanced treatment for the removal of pesticides such as oxidation with ozone and filtration by granular activated carbon gac has been considered effective but problems related to the process are still there like saturation of the activated carbon and the formation of toxic chemical by products which may develop in the advance oxidation processes 38 39 so basically in turkey generally three main types of treatment plant were used stabilization ponds for small communities 20 000 persons trickling filter for mid sized community and activated sludge or extended aerated activated sludge for a large scale community 40 37 according to ministry of science industry and technology there are 279 organized industrial zones oiz in turkey 41 laws and regulations regarding the use of treated wastewater as irrigation water were presented in technical notification on wastewater treatment plant procedures no 27527 dated march 20 2010 in annex 7 42 same notification provides guidelines for the reuse of treated wastewater in industrial processes industrial cooling along with some examples of practical applications of the action plan regarding reuse of treated industrial wastewater back in industries in the cities of istanbul konya and muğla previously these regulations were published in turkish water pollution control regulation technical aspects bulletin reference no 20748 1991 43 in action plan for wastewater treatment 2015 2023 37 emphasis was laid on the point that existing wastewater treatment plants should be modified for reuse of wastewater according to the needs and new wastewater treatment plants should be planned considering reuse facilities there are several public institutions organizations like ministry of environment and urban development forestry and water affairs ministry of culture and tourism and other municipalities and special provincial administrations that invest into environmental infrastructure projects using national resources between the years of 2009 and 2013 relevant ministries invested 4 812 449 067 tl approximately 1 632 556 260 us on construction and maintenance of sewage and wastewater treatment plants 37 description of types of treatment plants and schemes most common in turkey are given in table 3 4 wastewater treatment methods effective for reuse and current research trends in turkey several traditional water treatment plants and techniques are present nowadays in turkey high quality effluent requires water treatment shift from less developed methods toward advance methods costs will increase proportionally similarly highly polluted water requires high cost for treatment 44 levels of wastewater treatment along with their names and potential uses are represented in detailed yet simplified way in fig 1 for the years 2007 2023 eu integrated environmental strategy nes has been prepared in order to ensure turkey s sustainable economic and social development numerous aspects regarding potential reuse and the associated wastewater treatment process continue to be the object of research and innovation in turkey improvement of treatment facilities development of smart technologies and reduction in energy consumption are just some of the issues to be supported in this area to ensure the active participation of the whole society in decision making a collaborated setup has been established between public environmental protection activities private sector civil society organizations in close cooperation with academia 46 a review has presented in table 4 in which research conducted by different academic groups in turkey on the selection of wastewater treatment technology effective enough to remove generalized pollutants along with emerging micropollutants are discussed with the purpose of making wastewater reusable and recyclable opportunities and challenges are also presented that lead us to draw this conclusion that most of the scientists are interested in membrane technology and other advance treatment methods with the aim of wastewater reuse however challenges are there for the selection and construction of treatment trains or schemes to treat wastewater is highly dependent on the quality type of wastewater to be reclaimed along with other multiple factors like population size area available cost and political social acceptance more advanced techniques could be added at any stage of conventional treatment schemes according to the type of pollutants in water and discharge standards for reuse purposes as a consequence the eu directives discharge limits should be the starting point for further treatment of municipal wastewater for reuse it is to be noted that standard or typical schemes have their own strengths and weaknesses weaknesses have driven the use of membrane technology which is multifunctional and cost effective one of the innovating technologies is direct membrane filtration dmf of raw wastewater this is a purely physical process by which particles including microorganisms are removed from the wastewater by membrane filtration uf to remove large particles from the wastewater simple pre treatments such as screening sedimentation or dissolved air flotation daf can be applied the effluent of this process is particle free water rich in dissolved components nutrients possible applications of this new concept can be found in agriculture dmf is investigated in several places including turkey other innovating technologies are advanced oxidation processes these processes become more and more important since substances such as pesticides endocrine disrupters etc are given priority 82 5 wastewater reuse opportunities turkey is defined by economists and political scientists as one of the world s newly industrialized countries with gdp per sector agriculture 8 1 industry 27 7 services 64 2 83 generally central wastewater recovery applications are more common in turkey however individual applications household and on site sewage recycling grey water recycling applications are also available and can be intensified 84 selection of wastewater treatment method depends on many socio economic factors for instance the application features location terrain availability of water resources cultural norms and religious believes likewise planning of local authorities waste recycling policies and regulations is also important along with public awareness increased need of water has grown interest of people in water reuse in some areas but modification of existing wastewater treatment plants and construction of new wastewater treatment plants considering re use facilities should be the priority it is a great opportunity to apply advanced current technologies in wastewater treatment and reuse such as ultraviolet radiation oxidation processes maturation ponds membrane filtration and electrochemical treatment to remove effectively the pollutants including salinity pathogens heavy metals and emerging contaminants 85 in future with government involvement in establishing policies regulations and stakeholder s involvement can bring a boast in waste water reuse in turkey along with the revenue generation some of the opportunities that are important for future perspective and that can initiate reclaimed water use efforts in turkey are explained in following sections 5 1 wastewater reuse in agriculture agriculture plays a very important role in turkish economy but reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation has not been considered consciously till now as the country has not yet experienced severe water shortages 6 but significantly high benefits of wastewater reuse have been observed throughout the world both in terms of economics and agriculture sustainability 9 in 2000 42 km3 of water consumed was used for irrigation purposes 86 agricultural water use is not only the largest consumer of water in country 74 but also the greatest consumer of funds allocated for water resources projects 30 however irrigated lands are polluted and deteriorated quickly by improper culture and irrigation practices 8 presently the largest water consuming sector is agriculture which made up 65 70 of the global water demand 87 88 world bank in 2010 reported about one tenth of the global crops was irrigated with sewage unfortunately in which only 10 was properly treated although treated wastewater could supplement necessary nutrients for plants but the existence of emerging pollutants such as phthalates polychlorobiphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pharmaceutical compounds and personal care products 89 is a new growing concern turkey has approved its irrigation water quality standards in 1991 in the form of turkish water pollution control regulations also covering five quality classifications on the bases of water quality required for specific agricultural land and constraints on heavy metal and other toxic compounds concentrations generally adopted from who guidelines 43 another updated version of laws and regulations regarding the use of treated wastewater as irrigation water and industrial cooling processes was published in annex 7 technical notification procedures no 27527 dated march 20 2010 according to the regulations treated wastewater can be used in irrigation after getting a written statement issued by the concerned governmental organizations provincial banks agriculture ministry and environment and forest ministry will decide whether the effluent can be reused in irrigation or not 90 reuse of treated wastewater in some cities are given in table 2 37 of treated waste water that is discharged in to nearby creeks and rivers are reused for direct effluent directly used irrigation or indirect reuse through a receiving body agricultural uses in arid areas in which irrigation activities should be increased for crop production direct irrigation is experienced 10 9 currently effluents of uwwps urban wastewater treatment plants are not suitable for agricultural irrigation purposes because some of the uwwtps do not even have disinfection units as their final polishing treatment stage likewise organic micropollutants are another modern threat for open waters it has been observed that despite of the all the efforts to produce high quality wastewater treatment satisfactory and efficient operation is rarely achieved due to their high energy consumption and disinfecting chemicals requirements 5 2 urbanization some researchers think that the main reason of water crisis is the increasing water resource demand caused by urbanization and economical boast 91 urbanization process in the world began with industrial revolution and accelerated with globalization urbanization degree may be statistically derived from many loosely connected properties as described in detail by 92 such as land use type changes land cover construction activities motor driven vehicles registration energy consumption population and so on urbanization is defined as urban scale expanding due to populations transferring in search of better standards of life and the gathering of secondary and tertiary industries from rural to urban areas 85 turkey ranks number 18 in the list of countries by population with 75 837 020 people as of july 1 2014 records turkey s population is equivalent to 1 05 of the total world s population the population density in turkey is 97 people per km2 93 the studies on urbanization process in turkey were conducted mostly in 1970s and 80s there have not been any extensive studies after 80 s except the studies conducted by state planning organization spo to find out development levels of cities and provinces according to an estimate in 2007 67 5 population was living in cities and this percentage increased to 72 3 in the year 2012 the jurisdictions on administrative status change of cities are performed by head quarter of provincial administration in the ministry of internal affairs the changes are made possible via regulations or directives based on article 126 of the constitution 94 depending on these regulations or directives there have been changes in the number of cities from 1920 to 2009 currently with 81 cities 36 as shown in table 5 it is not obvious that the current water resource carrying capacity of turkey can support the rapid urbanization and economic development or not but it s clear that rapid urbanization can stimulate water resource use efficiency by implementing wastewater reuse 96 for example istanbul and ankara wastewater reclamation and reuse are now recognized as key components of water and wastewater management by urban managers many cities municipalities are now putting forward the plans of wastewater reuse 5 3 water stress and climate change water is the fundamental medium that transfers the effects of climate change to the ecology and human beings as stated by united nations water 97 increased global mean surface temperature 0 3 0 7 c for the years 2016 2035 and rise in sea level rise about 0 2 0 6 m by the year 2100 is reported 98 99 to adapt to more intensified climatic change intensified future planning is required especially for rapidly developing economies and urbanization 100 in order to the provide adequate ecosystem services 101 climate change reports forecast considerably reduced availabilities for many south european river basins the eurowasser model 102 has forecasted the impact of climate change on water availability in europe according to two different global circulation models for the time horizons 2020s and 2070s their calculations indicated river basins will have heavily reduced water availability decreases of more than 10 are projected for some continental countries poland hungary and south eastern countries bulgaria romania parts of turkey whereas most south european countries will experience reductions of 25 and more 103 unal et al 104 reported in their elaborated study about precipitation in turkey with the help of different models and tests in space and time they noticed complex temporal structure and spatial variations in dry and wet season because of which an obvious decrease in annual precipitation throughout anatolia including west and southwest sections whereas increased annual precipitation trends in northeast black sea region of turkey were observed turkey is the largest country in the eastern mediterranean 105 therefore in another study önol and unal 28 divided turkey into 7 homogeneous climate regions to understand its climatic variations they have concluded that precipitation results in future simulation reveal that precipitation in all seasons and in almost all regions decreases except for the autumn season in the future simulation warming over climatic regions is in the range of 2 5 c summer warming over western regions of turkey is 3 c higher than the winter warming during winter in the future simulation precipitation decreases very significantly over southeastern turkey 24 which covers most of the upstream of euphrates and tigris river basin this projected decrease could be a major source of concern for turkey and the neighboring countries 28 decreasing wet dry season precipitation and increasing temperatures throughout the country except northeast coasts and eastern parts of turkey is expected to have a strong impact on the economic livelihood of the region especially on agricultural production drinking water supply and hydroelectricity production 104 under the influence of climate change alternate water source like recycling water should be viewed as a necessity not an option indeed the opportunities and threats posed by the climate change for the water reclamation industry were interwoven 45 climate change triggers market with higher willingness on the use of reclaimed water and modern technology for treatment plants but unfortunately to date climate change impacts have hardly been studied thoroughly as not a single study is present reporting the influence of the climatic factors on water shortages and wastewater treatment and reuse potentials 5 4 wastewater reuse market various methods such as life cycle assessment lca and cost benefit analyses exist to quantify the costs of water services economic considerations for environment based projects like internal monetary units and external impacts nontangible are therefore of high importance 106 107 such as for water reuse 108 it is a common observation that a series of activities about the advantages of wastewater regeneration and reuse are often presented without supporting economic quantification 109 reported a great feasibility of water reuse projects undertaking a cost benefit analysis of water reuse projects incorporating all parameters including economic valuation environmental externalities and resource availability the reclaimed water is perceived as a part of total urban water management and received similar subsidy like other water services 44 the global municipal wastewater flow rate was estimated about 680 960 million m3 per day only a small fraction 4 equivalent to 32 million m3 was reclaimed in 2010 110 with an increasing demand on resource saving the quantity of recycled wastewater was expected to jump to 55 million m3 in 2015 111 developing countries normally accompanied with water constrained conditions tries to adapt gradually the world health organization who guidelines for more flexible approaches as targets for wastewater reuse have been clearly regulated in the official documents furthermore the playing ground in the water supply sector is more open to private companies 112 and they act as a monopoly of governmental organizations in most of the countries but in case of turkey key actors of the total water management is still the local governmental water authorities there is a huge tendency of socializing the water supply industry to share the financial burden of the governments 31 private sectors could participate in the process by delivering professional service packages as in public private partnerships ppps models 111 water management authorities and companies should not only consider the benefits of market value but also environmental benefits or the increase in the availability of a scarce resource 5 5 ground water exploitation groundwater resources are often exploited unsustainably with abstractions exceeding the recharge rate that leads towards over exploitation of the water resource the exploitation rate exceeds 50 in turkey syria lebanon the west bank algeria and morocco 113 excessive water abstraction can cause secondary effects in negatively affecting water quality in addition groundwater resources are polluted by insufficiently treated municipal wastewater and uncontrolled industrial pollution and more and more aquifers are lost for direct drinking water supply due to diffused pollution in case of turkey as per 2012 data about 4 9 billion m3 of water was drawn from different resources for drinking and domestic purposes by municipalities 48 9 of water was taken from dams 28 3 of the water was drawn from wells 19 2 from lakes and 2 and 1 6 from ponds and sea respectively according to data provided by turkey statistical institute in 2012 about 216 liters of water per person per day was provided by the municipal water supply networks similarly amount of water available per person in three major cities istanbul ankara and izmir was found to be 186 217 and 223 liters respectively tsi 2012 another considerable reason for high use of groundwater is for the agricultural purposes and the driving force is low prices of irrigation water pricing of irrigation water is based on land area but water fees should be regulated according to the volumetric water consumption 8 5 6 tourisms in aegean and mediterranean regions where touristic facilities are concentrated need of treatment plants has developed overtime in residential areas these effluents are used for garden and park irrigation and also in some places wastewater collected in the stabilization ponds is used for agricultural purposes 114 it is estimated that over 2000 small scale package plants exist in turkey for tourist settlements serving for populations between 20 and 800 persons and 75 of these serve for between 50 and 400 persons 115 9 for example in antalya being the center of tourism in south anatolia 14 urban wastewater treatment plants are in operation followed by istanbul greater metropolitan city that has 13 urban wastewater treatment plants and another 6 plants in the highly industrialized province kocaeli i e in the vicinity of istanbul 9 but recently number of wastewater treatment facilities has been increased as shown in table 2 and even number will increase in coming years along with the upgradation of already present facilities for reuse purposes 5 7 environmental protection and restoration an increasing number of countries have produced legislative framework for the safe use of treated municipal wastewater the legislative framework can be broken down into two types regulations and guidelines regulations are legally adopted enforceable and mandatory while guidelines are advisory voluntary and non enforceable but can be incorporated in treated wastewater reuse permits and in this way become enforceable requirements like who and national organizations of federal governments epa and australia which can then be used as a resource by states that have limited or no regulations or guidelines which offers guidelines and frameworks regarding methods of reuse treatment methods microbiological constituents chemical constituents physical properties monitoring and communication strategies compliance of new and existing environmental regulations and stricter pollution limit values also contribute towards the environmental protection and restoration turkey being having a diverse ecosystem aquatic and terrestrial has a great opportunity to develop its rules laws and regulation for wastewater treatment and its disposal for example the use of adequately treated wastewater for appropriate applications e g for irrigation or industrial cooling processes instead of abstracting river water can reduce or even cease the amount of wastewater discharged to water bodies thereby leading to compliance with water quality legislation this will not only minimize the water pollution but will also decrease the potential risk of micropollutants and growing bacterial resistance in water ecosystems the restoration and enhancement of natural habitats such as wetlands their creation for environmental and recreational purposes can also be considered as emerging drivers for treated wastewater reuse in turkey 6 wastewater reuse challenges discharge of untreated or partially treated municipal wastewater into surface water contamination of groundwater resulting from sewer systems leaks and open dumping of solid waste occurrence of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in soil and irrigation canals that ends up in ocean aquifers and surface water inadequate incorrect agricultural practices rapid erosions and sedimentation of natural lakes and dams due to deforestation are the biggest reasons of water deformation in turkey some of the practical concerns are given in table 6 which are also reported by other researchers 3 6 1 social perception acceptance of wastewater reuse the most critical factor determining the sustainability of the reclamation scheme is not lying on the technology itself but rather on public acceptance 116 the ratio of people willing to use recycled water for non potable purposes not surprisingly overweighed those for drinking purposes reported in many studies around the world 117 118 119 120 121 122 a greater support of reclaimed wastewater for agriculture public utilities and low contact purposes was well recognized 123 whereas most of objections fell into projects with human close contact therefore buyukkamaci and alkan 117 conducted a survey designed to increase public awareness and to determine the potential for acceptance of wastewater reuse applications in turkey respondents felt that treated wastewater reuse for applications not involving close personal contact was acceptable due to health risk concerns on the other hand the cost of reclaimed water was another major public concern in turkey most respondents have a positive conception for reuse alternatives of toilet flushing 64 cleaning roads 63 use in construction 63 and use in fire extinguish systems 58 117 however in the case of direct human contact with treated water a majority opposed treated water uses most of the participants do not support the use of reclaimed water for the preparation of canned vegetables and other foods and drinking purposes less or minimal acceptance towards reuse of wastewater could be because of religious and cultural taboos friedler et al 124 reported cost saving 71 positive outcomes on the environment 36 and saving potable water 34 as advantages for a household climate change has changed the public perception about wastewater reclamation and reuse not only for agriculture but also for their household usage for instance over 78 of local residents in switzerland perceived long term changes in precipitation and or temperature and experienced its effects on the urban drainage and wastewater system in recent years 125 the fact is success of advocating a wastewater reuse scheme depends greatly on the adopted communicative strategy and transparency of information 126 promoting a voluntary spirit bottom up where people familiarized themselves with recycled water would result in a higher support than applying compulsory measures top down dolnicar et al 126 and hurlimann 127 believed that if people involved their senses with reclaimed water they tended to accept recycled water for close to personal use trust on water authorities to ensure water quality and quantity will proportionally increase gradually therefore a water reclamation project must utilize the mass media and larger communities for communicating scientific information about its benefits and risks to maximize the public understanding on water reuse 116 6 2 lack of framework of guidelines for safe treated wastewater reuse in order to reduce the environmental and health impacts of wastewater reuse countries have adopted several standards and guidelines that differ from each other even at the regional level practice of wastewater reuse mainly depends on a country s economy infrastructural status covering wastewater treatment capacity and capability educational level climate water supply balance between water requirement and demand intensity of agricultural activities population social habits like cultural and religious prejudice and many other factors 128 in turkey ministry of environment has been established as the authority and administrative structure to identify and achieve the goals of the national environmental policy in 1991 in 2003 after collaboration with the ministry of forestry it has continued to operate as the ministry of environment and forests water amendment and determination of policies related to waste management were made in 2011 and for this purpose ministry of environment and urban development comes together with ministry of forestry and water affairs turkey has very limited regulations of wastewater reuse for agricultural purposes with many loop holes the regulation has many technical limitations for recycling wastewater in terms of treatment methods and suitability of industrial treated wastewaters to be used for irrigation 129 recently limited regulations that determine the discharge standards and appropriate sanctions were made in order to protect and improve water quality control of pollution sources purifying the contaminated water and wastewater re safe use by ministry of environment and urban planning organization official gazette 04 07 2011 no 27984 and environmental law article 29 will be followed in accordance with the wastewater treatment plant utilization of incentive measures for the regulation on principles and procedures official gazette 01 10 2010 no 27716 page 111 130 131 42 in addition objective of the master plan is to satisfy standards of eu urban wastewater treatment directive 132 for the discharges into sensitive zones starting from 2010 discharge limits for preliminary and pretreatment of wastewater defined in water pollution control regulation 133 are bod5 45 mg l ss 30 mg l and microbial quality total coliform concentrations will be less than 1000 100 ml and fecal coliform will be less than 200 100 ml in the 90 of water body samples on the other hand there are no legislative regulations at the european level concerning wastewater reuse so far apart from the urban wastewater treatment directive 91 271 eec which advises to reuse wastewater whenever appropriate 132 134 135 however an updated complete set of guidelines are present for water reuse published by us epa 136 6 3 human health risk the probability of infection associated with reclaimed water and wastewater reuse has been reported by different studies separately according to the types of wastewater like conventionally treated wastewater storm wastewater grey water and rain water 137 138 139 140 141 risk from various pathogens viral bacterial parasitic protozoan and helminths and chemicals pharmaceuticals disinfection byproducts pesticides metals etc when ingested inhaled or absorbed through the skin cannot be ignored these pathogens and chemicals may cause a range of health outcomes from acute illness to chronic diseases and mortality if found in reclaimed water 31 if the emphasis is put on a maximum risk reduction independently of the costs associated to the treatments then the standards are usually restrictive and cost of projects will be high on the contrary if the emphasis is on an acceptable risk level the standards are not so important but are combined with other tools like lca and cost benefit analysis 3 in this case costs could be affordable 7 conclusion in this paper a wide range of documents has been analyzed to provide a synthetic outlook and update on wastewater treatment reuse opportunities and constraints policy makers academia national and international firms are aware of the potential benefits in the field of wastewater reuse but lack of public interest and negligence of implementing authorities may leading efforts in vain this scenario is perhaps not unique to turkey instead all developing countries have such challenges many wastewater treatment facilities are equipped with water reuse system but reclaimed water is not efficiently reused in other most of the cases there is a good opportunity to build new units or update exciting treatment units with new emerging techniques as per the needs of growing population although turkish government have many long term and short term plans for installation of wwtps in all parts of country but the institutions need to clarify that the available methods related to the specific water use should be made available including reuse for aquaculture the reuse for wetland development as well as the reuse of treated grey water treated excreta and treated sewage sludge in agriculture responsible ministries and agencies should have an additional department for problem identification and implementation of solutions according to the expected degree of pollution technology solutions should be proposed by taking care of microbiological constituents chemical constituents and physical parameters of wastewater as the existing wastewater treatment plants must overcome their deficiencies in terms of micropollutants removal by the installation or upgradation to advance treatment methodologies this whole process can be assured by the availability of best technicians academicians engineers and workers to regulate wastewater treatment plants to minimize extent of errors appropriate monitoring criteria should be selected for monitoring of wastewater on regular basis not only to ensure best result of the treatment but also results should be publish for general population to win the public confidence the reference framework of guidelines for the safe use of treated wastewater should integrate the impacts and pressure of extensive international tourism and transboundary river basins check that can be the hurdle in implementation of reuse plan likewise formation of wastewater reuse guidelines or regulations should involve proper public involvement may be with the help of print and soft media reuse of wastewater in agricultural production has a lot of benefits and is a very important subject to be regulated in a separate more field based standard guideline for irrigation country should formulate its own strict regulations according to the needs of economy and better production in turkey determining the wastewater treatment needs and afterward associated benefits are not yet well understood the marketing of recycled wastewater engineering evaluations and cost analysis of alternatives in terms of economics steps to be followed in the planning of facilities for wastewater recycling and reuse are still insufficient for future recommendations first step should be the primary data collection from each city to understand the level and type of water pollution then by involving academic institutes a proper technical solution could be found presently without any proper collaboration between private and government institutes most of the research activities went in vain as when government will allow private sector to jump in they will come up with implementable solutions second important future recommendation is to integrate the risk of climate change into the national action plan complete understanding of climate changes that turkey is going to face in near future or is facing on this very day will speed up water reuse work and aims and will lead to new policies and regulations acknowledgment we would like to acknowledge the scientific and technological research council of turkey s tübi̇tak 2215 program for supporting international students in their research activities 
14378,high gravimetric technology or higee is a novel technique which uses centrifugal force in a rotating packed bed rpb contactor in rpb a doughnut shaped bed is spun at high speed to allow fluid to flow through an adsorbent bed at a high velocity centrifugal force enhances the adsorption process with increased mass transfer coefficient in this study the optimum condition of the working parameters of a rpb contactor for arsenic removal by activated carbon was investigated and optimised by taguchi method five parameters namely rotating speed feed rate packing density initial concentration and initial solution ph were considered in determining the initial optimal condition in a l16 orthogonal array according to the signal to noise ratio s n the optimum condition obtained from the l16 experiments are rotating speed of 1600 rpm feed rate of 50 l h packing density of 510 kg m3 initial concentration of 150 mg l and ph of 3 depending upon the delta value which is the difference between the highest and lowest s n ratio it was found that the initial concentration was the least affecting factor and ph could be fixed at 3 for practical purposes keywords higee rotating packed bed contactor taguchi method arsenic water treatment 1 introduction enhancement of mass transfer by using centrifugal force field was achieved through the innovation of high gravimetric technology higee in the late 1970s at ici the mass transfer process is carried out in a doughnut shaped bed known as a rotating packed bed rpb 1 as mentioned by lin and liu 2 rpb contactor was first designed by collin ramshaw and roger h mallinson in the year 1981 for effective mass transfer process between two fluid phases this doughnut shaped bed is spun at high speed to achieve high centrifugal force due to the elevated force very thin liquid films and or tiny droplets are created in the packing area thus gas liquid or liquid liquid or solid liquid interfaces are constantly renewed which aid in considerable intensification of mass transfer between the phases 3 initially these rpb higee systems were used in separation processes such as distillation and absorption however it can also be applied in mass transfer limited reacting systems the advantages of using higee are i higher throughput and ii the formation of thinner liquid film over the packings this results in decreased external mass transfer resistance higher surface packing per unit volume of packed bed better distribution of liquid over the packings and lower static holdup thus the size of the processing equipment is significantly reduced in comparison to a conventional packed bed moreover it is likely to reduce the overall cost of wastewater treatment 2 4 adsorption being a mass transfer controlled process the higee technology in rpb can be used for adsorptive removal of heavy metals or dyes from wastewater adsorption onto activated carbon is one of the most effective methods for heavy metal removal however the size of an industrial facility is generally large to facilitate the high volume of effluent due to the high throughput the rpb higee can be useful in treating high volume of wastewater lin and liu 2 studied the adsorption of basic yellow 2 dye on activated carbon in a centrifugal adsorption bed influenced by centrifugal acceleration whilst das et al 5 experienced enhanced volumetric mass transfer coefficient for biosorption of cu ii ions on catlacatla fish scale with increasing rotor speed in rpb contactor panda et al 6 also reported better mass transfer rate at higher rotational speed while using crude tamarind tamarindus indica fruit shell to remove cr vi ions from an aqueous solution in a rpb contactor in the present work we have extended the investigation for one of the most toxic elements which is arsenic as arsenic is reported to be one of the most toxic heavy metals that can exist in the water body arsenic occurs naturally in soils and can be mobilized by weathering reactions and biological activities and this may lead to contamination of surface or groundwater aquifers 7 elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater have been reported in many countries such as chile mexico china argentina usa hungary india west bengal bangladesh and vietnam 8 the consumption of water with high arsenic content can cause several acute and chronic illnesses such as nausea abdominal pain diarrhea multisystem diseases besides inactivating up the enzymes that are involved in cellular energy pathways and dna synthesis and repair 9 arsenic poisoning is also reported to cause skin lesions and cancer of the liver brain stomach and kidney 10 due to the fact that drinking water is one of the major routes for arsenic uptake a very strict drinking water allowance limit of 10 μg l has been prescribed by the us environmental protection agency 11 nevertheless it is worth noting that the mobility of arsenic is dependent on its species and valence state under aerobic environments as v is dominant usually in the form of arsenate aso4 3 under reducing conditions as iii dominates existing as arsenite aso3 3 which is water soluble and is 25 60 times more toxic than as v 12 10 recently there have been a number of publications reporting technologies that can effectively remove arsenic from water and these are electrocoagulation 13 14 electrodialysis 15 and adsorption using iron coated seaweeds 16 magnet responsive nanomaterials 17 and magnetic chitosan 18 however there is no reported work on the removal of arsenic by activated carbon in rpb contactor in the present study an optimization will be performed by taguchi method to obtain a robust product or process design at low cost orthogonal array will be used to determine optimum design points by performing minimum number of experiments 19 20 the log functions of desired output defined by taguchi as signal to noise ratios s n serve as the objective function for data analysis and optimization 21 taguchi method also considers the effects of noise factors which are inconvenient to control in this method the optimum condition will be insensitive to the noise factor the specific objective of the present work is to employ activated carbon in rpb contactor system and optimise the process variables that are important for as removal the operating parameters such as the rotor speed feed rate activated carbon packing density initial concentration and initial ph of the solution were selected for the purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used were of reagent grade the arsenic species in this study was as v which was prepared using na2haso4 7h2o the activated carbon was purchased from sigma aldrich and was used as received 2 2 rotating packed bed system a rpb reactor is a special type of contactor in which a doughnut shaped packed bed is rotated using a motor as shown in fig 1 the height of the rpb is 2 5 cm the inner radius of the rotor is 2 cm and the outer radius is 3 2 cm the annular space for the packing is 1 cm width the inner and outer walls are made of stainless steel mesh of size 50 μm the rotor is driven by a 0 5 hp motor at a speed ranging from 100 to 2000 rpm thereby generating 0 3 112 times the gravitational force on the basis of the arithmetic mean radius the activated carbon was placed in the annular space of the rotor at various packing densities arsenic solution was injected through a port on the inner wall of the rotor coming out from the outer wall of the rotating rotor the liquid flow path is as indicated in fig 1b 2 3 taguchi method in taguchi method a set of response variables are tested against a set of control parameters or independent variables by experiments arranged in orthogonal array to obtain the most suitable combination of the control parameters orthogonal arrays provide a best set of well balanced and minimum number of experiments required to identify the optimum conditions the log functions of desired outputs which are known as the signal to noise ratios s n serve as the objective functions for optimization the s n ratio is also used in data analysis and in the prediction of the optimum results the target of a process as defined here is the numerical value that is preferred for the quality characteristic of interest depending upon the target value there are three forms of s n ratios namely i smaller the better ii larger the better and iii nominal the best which are of common interest for optimization of static problems expressed by eqs 1 3 respectively where s n is the s n ratio r is the percentage removal at each run n is number of repeated runs for each experiment and σ is the standard deviation in the present work the algorithm for larger the better s n ratio was chosen for the optimization as the removal of arsenic should be as high as possible at the optimum condition 22 23 1 s n 10 log 1 n i 1 n r i 2 2 s n 10 log 1 n i 1 n 1 r i 2 3 s n 10 log r 2 σ 2 the optimization process was carried out in two stages at the initial stage which can be taken as the coarse optimization the full possible range was considered for each of the control factors that are important for the removal of arsenic in this stage the significance and contribution of the factors towards the optimization were identified however as the levels chosen at this stage were of very wide range the optimum point obtained might not be very accurate thus in the second stage which can be taken as the fine tuning stage the levels chosen were in close vicinity to the initial optimum points thereby a more accurate optimum point was derived 2 3 1 initial determination of best settings coarse optimization an l16 orthogonal array was chosen for the initial determination of the best settings where 16 different experiments were carried out the experiments were performed with different combination of rotating speed feed rate packing density initial concentration and initial solution ph the levels and range for each parameter are illustrated in table 1 as the arsenic species employed was arsenic v the ph range selected was 2 5 this is based on previous experiments which state that arsenic v is favoured to be adsorbed on activated carbon at low ph range 24 27 in addition the feed rate and packing density were selected based on the operating limitation of the set up the feed rate was investigated within the range 20 50 l h as 50 l h was the maximum possible operating condition for the peristaltic pump the range of packing density was 153 510 kg m3 based on the mass of activated carbon that can be positioned in the rpb contactor at maximum mass of the activated carbon the packing density was 663 kg m3 which was investigated during the fine tuning experiments the experimental design matrix of l16 array that is suggested by the taguchi method is given in table 2 in the experiment activated carbon was packed in the annular space of the rotor at different packing densities as specified in table 2 for each run 1 l of arsenic solution of desired concentration was taken in a 2 l beaker serving as the reservoir the solution was recirculated from the reservoir by a peristaltic pump capable of maintaining the flow rate required for that particular run the system ran for one hour and then a final sample was drawn from the reservoir for testing final arsenic concentration using inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 2 3 2 fine tuning stage the results of the initial optimization method could be used to reveal the significance of each factor by ranking them the ranking was based on the delta values which were calculated as the difference of the highest and lowest mean s n ratio values of each factor depending upon the rank obtained the most important factors influencing the removal of arsenic was selected and a fine tuning experiment was conducted to obtain a more accurate result the insignificant factor was kept at a constant value as suggested by the initial optimum experiment for the fine tuning experiment three significant factors were chosen namely ph feed rate and packing density based on the coarse optimization values and an l9 array of experiments with three different levels were utilized tables 3 and 4 the experiments were conducted in similar manner to the initial optimization but in this fine tuning experiment the run time was kept at three hours to reach complete equilibrium the percentage removal was calculated by eq 4 where c0 mg l 1 is the initial arsenic concentration and ct mg l 1 is the arsenic concentration at any time t 4 percentage removal c 0 c t c 0 100 3 result and discussions 3 1 characterization of the activated carbon the characterization study for the activated carbon was carried out using scanning electron microscopy brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis and ftir spectroscopy the sem image in fig 2 shows that the surface morphology of the activated carbon is rough and porous nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms can be used to determine the specific surface area of the activated carbon through the utilization of bet equation the nitrogen adsorption desorption plot shown in fig 3 suggests that the activated carbon can be characterized as mesoporous and microporous adsorbent monolayer adsorption only with relatively small external surfaces the bet surface area was found to be 583 m2 g the pore size distribution curves show that the activated carbon contained mainly micro and meso pores which assisted in the adsorption process the average pore diameter of the activated carbon was found to be 22 å ftir data of the activated carbon in fig 4 reveals a peak between 3500 and 3200 cm 1 which is attributed to oh stretching of alcohol group or phenol group intensity of the band of 3000 2850 cm 1 corresponding to ch stretch of alkanes is minimum suggesting these groups are not present in the activated carbon the complex peaks around 1580 1650 cm 1 in the activated carbon could be attributed to cc stretch of aromatic ring and co axial deformation such as highly conjugated co stretching or co stretching in carboxyl groups 28 the co stretch for alcohol group carboxylic acid group ester group corresponding to the bands 1300 1000 cm 1 is present in the activated carbon 3 2 initial optimization effects of the control factors on arsenic removal a set of 16 experimental runs were performed in triplicate and the calculated s n ratio is as given in table 2 the main effects of the parameters on arsenic removal are as shown in fig 5 it can be observed that with increasing of rotating speed from 400 rpm to 800 rpm the s n ratio increased then as the rotating speed was increased to 1200 rpm a slight drop in s n ratio was observed however further increase in the rotating speed again resulted in an increase in the s n ratio the highest value of s n ratio was obtained at level 4 which was 1600 rpm the initial increase in s n ratio can be attributed to the increase in mass transfer coefficient due to higher centrifugal force the decrease in adsorption at 1200 rpm occurred due to the fact that the solid mass of activated carbon shifted towards the outer wall of the rotor with increasing rotor speed thereby decreasing the path length of the liquid flow within activated carbon the liquid profile inside the rotor also took an egg shell like shape due to the centrifugal force 29 and therefore contributed to the decrease in path length with increasing rotational speed the depth of the egg shell increased and path length decreases further in this case the increase in mass transfer coefficient due to increasing centrifugal force 6 cannot compensate for the effect of decrease in liquid flow path length however when the rotor speed was increased further the adsorption again increased in this case the increase in the mass transfer coefficient predominated over the decrease in path length due to displacement of the activated carbon and the water profile towards the outer wall of the rotor 5 feed rate is one of the parameters that can affect the adsorption of arsenic it was observed from fig 5 that there is an increasing trend in the s n ratio with the increase in feed rate higher feed rate increases the probability of contact between the activated carbon and liquid which in turn increases the adsorption of arsenic 30 in addition the increasing trend of s n ratio was also observed in case of packing density with increasing amount of activated carbon the packing was more compact and there was less distortion of the pack during high speed rotation this ensures that the path length travelled by the liquid was maintained high in comparison to low compaction where less quantity of activated carbon was used the initial increasing trend of s n ratio with increasing concentration was due to the fact that with increasing concentration more arsenic was available for adsorption however increase in concentration from 150 ppm to 200 ppm results in a reduced s n ratio as shown in fig 5 this was possibly due to the saturation of arsenic on the activated carbon causing the reduction in the removal efficiency hence at very high concentration the adsorption was not feasible ph played a significant role in case of arsenic adsorption it was observed that at ph of 2 the s n ratio was very low and it increased substantially at ph 3 and remained almost the same at ph 4 and ph 5 the measured redox potential of the solutions were found to be between 0 7 v 0 75 v according to the eh ph diagram of arsenic given in fig 6 the main species at ph 2 is neutral h3aso4 and the main species at ph 3 5 is h2aso4 at lower ph the surface of the activated carbon becomes highly protonated at ph 3 as the negatively charged arsenic species predominated the electrostatic force of attraction between the protonated surface of activated carbon and the charged species allowed higher adsorption the trend remained almost the same at ph 4 and 5 however at ph 2 a very low s n ratio was observed it can be suggested that at such ph the neutral species was predominating in the solution and there were less attraction for the protonated surface which resulted in less adsorption the initial best settings of the parameters for arsenic removal were the levels with highest s n ratio based on the larger the better algorithm the response for s n ratio for each level is as shown in table 5 the bold marked values indicate the highest value of s n ratio and the corresponding levels are the initial best settings for arsenic removal in rpb using the activated carbon according to table 5 the best setting is rotating speed of 1600 rpm feed rate of 50 l h packing density of 510 kg m3 initial concentration of 150 ppm and ph of 3 the significance of the parameters is measured by the difference of the highest and lowest s n ratio across the levels i e the fluctuation of the s n ratio determines whether that parameter has significant effect on the removal or not this difference is denoted by delta values the higher the delta value for the factor the more significant it is based on the delta values a rank is assigned to the factors the most significant parameter is assigned number 1 rank and subsequent ranks are provided according to the delta values from table 5 it is observed that the most important 3 factors are ph feed rate and packing density 3 3 fine tuning experiment once the most significant factors were determined these three factors were used to obtain more accurate levels of the parameter setting the range of values was narrowed down to the close proximity of the initial best settings the parameters and levels chosen for fine tuning experiment are as shown in table 3 the l9 experiments were carried out and the obtained results suggested that the initial optimization was accurate and the fine tuning values coincide with the initially suggested best settings the rotating speed was fixed at 1600 rpm and the initial concentration was fixed at 50 ppm fig 7 shows the main effect plots for s n ratio in case of the fine tuning experiments the highest s n ratio was observed at level 2 for ph and level 2 for feed rate for packing density the s n ratio at level 1 and level 2 are almost similar therefore the fine tuning experiment suggest that the optimised best setting for the arsenic removal in rpb is ph of 3 feed rate of 45 l h and packing density of 357 kg m3 while the rotating speed is 1600 rpm and the initial concentration is 50 ppm according to these fine tuning experiments it was observed that the initial best setting was not exactly accurate when the range was narrowed down more accurate best settings were obtained the reduction of feed rate from 50 l h to 45 l h will save energy required for pumping reduction of packing density is also significant as this will reduce the amount of activated carbon required thus contributing to the reduction of operating cost an experiment was conducted based on the suggested optimum setting and the predicted removal and actual removal coincided with each other satisfactorily as given in table 6 4 conclusion taguchi method was applied in this study to determine the optimum operating conditions for the adsorption of arsenic on commercially available activated carbon in rpb system the experiment was conducted in two parts initially the best setting for the removal of arsenic in rotating packed bed was determined by considering a broad range of the experimental parameters namely rotating speed feed rate packing density initial concentration and initial solution ph it was observed that feed rate packing density and ph were the most significant factors based on the variation in their s n values across the levels in the fine tuning stage the range of these three significant parameters were selected in the near vicinity of the initial best settings and the other two parameters i e rotating speed and initial concentration were fixed at 1600 rpm and 50 ppm respectively it was observed that the optimum operating conditions became more accurate and precise when fine tuning experiments were conducted more accurate settings for the experiments contribute to variability in the adsorption process and reduced material and energy loss the predicted removal of 96 68 is in very good agreement with the experimentally obtained removal of 94 09 at the best settings of the operating parameters acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the funding provided by uk

14378,high gravimetric technology or higee is a novel technique which uses centrifugal force in a rotating packed bed rpb contactor in rpb a doughnut shaped bed is spun at high speed to allow fluid to flow through an adsorbent bed at a high velocity centrifugal force enhances the adsorption process with increased mass transfer coefficient in this study the optimum condition of the working parameters of a rpb contactor for arsenic removal by activated carbon was investigated and optimised by taguchi method five parameters namely rotating speed feed rate packing density initial concentration and initial solution ph were considered in determining the initial optimal condition in a l16 orthogonal array according to the signal to noise ratio s n the optimum condition obtained from the l16 experiments are rotating speed of 1600 rpm feed rate of 50 l h packing density of 510 kg m3 initial concentration of 150 mg l and ph of 3 depending upon the delta value which is the difference between the highest and lowest s n ratio it was found that the initial concentration was the least affecting factor and ph could be fixed at 3 for practical purposes keywords higee rotating packed bed contactor taguchi method arsenic water treatment 1 introduction enhancement of mass transfer by using centrifugal force field was achieved through the innovation of high gravimetric technology higee in the late 1970s at ici the mass transfer process is carried out in a doughnut shaped bed known as a rotating packed bed rpb 1 as mentioned by lin and liu 2 rpb contactor was first designed by collin ramshaw and roger h mallinson in the year 1981 for effective mass transfer process between two fluid phases this doughnut shaped bed is spun at high speed to achieve high centrifugal force due to the elevated force very thin liquid films and or tiny droplets are created in the packing area thus gas liquid or liquid liquid or solid liquid interfaces are constantly renewed which aid in considerable intensification of mass transfer between the phases 3 initially these rpb higee systems were used in separation processes such as distillation and absorption however it can also be applied in mass transfer limited reacting systems the advantages of using higee are i higher throughput and ii the formation of thinner liquid film over the packings this results in decreased external mass transfer resistance higher surface packing per unit volume of packed bed better distribution of liquid over the packings and lower static holdup thus the size of the processing equipment is significantly reduced in comparison to a conventional packed bed moreover it is likely to reduce the overall cost of wastewater treatment 2 4 adsorption being a mass transfer controlled process the higee technology in rpb can be used for adsorptive removal of heavy metals or dyes from wastewater adsorption onto activated carbon is one of the most effective methods for heavy metal removal however the size of an industrial facility is generally large to facilitate the high volume of effluent due to the high throughput the rpb higee can be useful in treating high volume of wastewater lin and liu 2 studied the adsorption of basic yellow 2 dye on activated carbon in a centrifugal adsorption bed influenced by centrifugal acceleration whilst das et al 5 experienced enhanced volumetric mass transfer coefficient for biosorption of cu ii ions on catlacatla fish scale with increasing rotor speed in rpb contactor panda et al 6 also reported better mass transfer rate at higher rotational speed while using crude tamarind tamarindus indica fruit shell to remove cr vi ions from an aqueous solution in a rpb contactor in the present work we have extended the investigation for one of the most toxic elements which is arsenic as arsenic is reported to be one of the most toxic heavy metals that can exist in the water body arsenic occurs naturally in soils and can be mobilized by weathering reactions and biological activities and this may lead to contamination of surface or groundwater aquifers 7 elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater have been reported in many countries such as chile mexico china argentina usa hungary india west bengal bangladesh and vietnam 8 the consumption of water with high arsenic content can cause several acute and chronic illnesses such as nausea abdominal pain diarrhea multisystem diseases besides inactivating up the enzymes that are involved in cellular energy pathways and dna synthesis and repair 9 arsenic poisoning is also reported to cause skin lesions and cancer of the liver brain stomach and kidney 10 due to the fact that drinking water is one of the major routes for arsenic uptake a very strict drinking water allowance limit of 10 μg l has been prescribed by the us environmental protection agency 11 nevertheless it is worth noting that the mobility of arsenic is dependent on its species and valence state under aerobic environments as v is dominant usually in the form of arsenate aso4 3 under reducing conditions as iii dominates existing as arsenite aso3 3 which is water soluble and is 25 60 times more toxic than as v 12 10 recently there have been a number of publications reporting technologies that can effectively remove arsenic from water and these are electrocoagulation 13 14 electrodialysis 15 and adsorption using iron coated seaweeds 16 magnet responsive nanomaterials 17 and magnetic chitosan 18 however there is no reported work on the removal of arsenic by activated carbon in rpb contactor in the present study an optimization will be performed by taguchi method to obtain a robust product or process design at low cost orthogonal array will be used to determine optimum design points by performing minimum number of experiments 19 20 the log functions of desired output defined by taguchi as signal to noise ratios s n serve as the objective function for data analysis and optimization 21 taguchi method also considers the effects of noise factors which are inconvenient to control in this method the optimum condition will be insensitive to the noise factor the specific objective of the present work is to employ activated carbon in rpb contactor system and optimise the process variables that are important for as removal the operating parameters such as the rotor speed feed rate activated carbon packing density initial concentration and initial ph of the solution were selected for the purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used were of reagent grade the arsenic species in this study was as v which was prepared using na2haso4 7h2o the activated carbon was purchased from sigma aldrich and was used as received 2 2 rotating packed bed system a rpb reactor is a special type of contactor in which a doughnut shaped packed bed is rotated using a motor as shown in fig 1 the height of the rpb is 2 5 cm the inner radius of the rotor is 2 cm and the outer radius is 3 2 cm the annular space for the packing is 1 cm width the inner and outer walls are made of stainless steel mesh of size 50 μm the rotor is driven by a 0 5 hp motor at a speed ranging from 100 to 2000 rpm thereby generating 0 3 112 times the gravitational force on the basis of the arithmetic mean radius the activated carbon was placed in the annular space of the rotor at various packing densities arsenic solution was injected through a port on the inner wall of the rotor coming out from the outer wall of the rotating rotor the liquid flow path is as indicated in fig 1b 2 3 taguchi method in taguchi method a set of response variables are tested against a set of control parameters or independent variables by experiments arranged in orthogonal array to obtain the most suitable combination of the control parameters orthogonal arrays provide a best set of well balanced and minimum number of experiments required to identify the optimum conditions the log functions of desired outputs which are known as the signal to noise ratios s n serve as the objective functions for optimization the s n ratio is also used in data analysis and in the prediction of the optimum results the target of a process as defined here is the numerical value that is preferred for the quality characteristic of interest depending upon the target value there are three forms of s n ratios namely i smaller the better ii larger the better and iii nominal the best which are of common interest for optimization of static problems expressed by eqs 1 3 respectively where s n is the s n ratio r is the percentage removal at each run n is number of repeated runs for each experiment and σ is the standard deviation in the present work the algorithm for larger the better s n ratio was chosen for the optimization as the removal of arsenic should be as high as possible at the optimum condition 22 23 1 s n 10 log 1 n i 1 n r i 2 2 s n 10 log 1 n i 1 n 1 r i 2 3 s n 10 log r 2 σ 2 the optimization process was carried out in two stages at the initial stage which can be taken as the coarse optimization the full possible range was considered for each of the control factors that are important for the removal of arsenic in this stage the significance and contribution of the factors towards the optimization were identified however as the levels chosen at this stage were of very wide range the optimum point obtained might not be very accurate thus in the second stage which can be taken as the fine tuning stage the levels chosen were in close vicinity to the initial optimum points thereby a more accurate optimum point was derived 2 3 1 initial determination of best settings coarse optimization an l16 orthogonal array was chosen for the initial determination of the best settings where 16 different experiments were carried out the experiments were performed with different combination of rotating speed feed rate packing density initial concentration and initial solution ph the levels and range for each parameter are illustrated in table 1 as the arsenic species employed was arsenic v the ph range selected was 2 5 this is based on previous experiments which state that arsenic v is favoured to be adsorbed on activated carbon at low ph range 24 27 in addition the feed rate and packing density were selected based on the operating limitation of the set up the feed rate was investigated within the range 20 50 l h as 50 l h was the maximum possible operating condition for the peristaltic pump the range of packing density was 153 510 kg m3 based on the mass of activated carbon that can be positioned in the rpb contactor at maximum mass of the activated carbon the packing density was 663 kg m3 which was investigated during the fine tuning experiments the experimental design matrix of l16 array that is suggested by the taguchi method is given in table 2 in the experiment activated carbon was packed in the annular space of the rotor at different packing densities as specified in table 2 for each run 1 l of arsenic solution of desired concentration was taken in a 2 l beaker serving as the reservoir the solution was recirculated from the reservoir by a peristaltic pump capable of maintaining the flow rate required for that particular run the system ran for one hour and then a final sample was drawn from the reservoir for testing final arsenic concentration using inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 2 3 2 fine tuning stage the results of the initial optimization method could be used to reveal the significance of each factor by ranking them the ranking was based on the delta values which were calculated as the difference of the highest and lowest mean s n ratio values of each factor depending upon the rank obtained the most important factors influencing the removal of arsenic was selected and a fine tuning experiment was conducted to obtain a more accurate result the insignificant factor was kept at a constant value as suggested by the initial optimum experiment for the fine tuning experiment three significant factors were chosen namely ph feed rate and packing density based on the coarse optimization values and an l9 array of experiments with three different levels were utilized tables 3 and 4 the experiments were conducted in similar manner to the initial optimization but in this fine tuning experiment the run time was kept at three hours to reach complete equilibrium the percentage removal was calculated by eq 4 where c0 mg l 1 is the initial arsenic concentration and ct mg l 1 is the arsenic concentration at any time t 4 percentage removal c 0 c t c 0 100 3 result and discussions 3 1 characterization of the activated carbon the characterization study for the activated carbon was carried out using scanning electron microscopy brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis and ftir spectroscopy the sem image in fig 2 shows that the surface morphology of the activated carbon is rough and porous nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms can be used to determine the specific surface area of the activated carbon through the utilization of bet equation the nitrogen adsorption desorption plot shown in fig 3 suggests that the activated carbon can be characterized as mesoporous and microporous adsorbent monolayer adsorption only with relatively small external surfaces the bet surface area was found to be 583 m2 g the pore size distribution curves show that the activated carbon contained mainly micro and meso pores which assisted in the adsorption process the average pore diameter of the activated carbon was found to be 22 å ftir data of the activated carbon in fig 4 reveals a peak between 3500 and 3200 cm 1 which is attributed to oh stretching of alcohol group or phenol group intensity of the band of 3000 2850 cm 1 corresponding to ch stretch of alkanes is minimum suggesting these groups are not present in the activated carbon the complex peaks around 1580 1650 cm 1 in the activated carbon could be attributed to cc stretch of aromatic ring and co axial deformation such as highly conjugated co stretching or co stretching in carboxyl groups 28 the co stretch for alcohol group carboxylic acid group ester group corresponding to the bands 1300 1000 cm 1 is present in the activated carbon 3 2 initial optimization effects of the control factors on arsenic removal a set of 16 experimental runs were performed in triplicate and the calculated s n ratio is as given in table 2 the main effects of the parameters on arsenic removal are as shown in fig 5 it can be observed that with increasing of rotating speed from 400 rpm to 800 rpm the s n ratio increased then as the rotating speed was increased to 1200 rpm a slight drop in s n ratio was observed however further increase in the rotating speed again resulted in an increase in the s n ratio the highest value of s n ratio was obtained at level 4 which was 1600 rpm the initial increase in s n ratio can be attributed to the increase in mass transfer coefficient due to higher centrifugal force the decrease in adsorption at 1200 rpm occurred due to the fact that the solid mass of activated carbon shifted towards the outer wall of the rotor with increasing rotor speed thereby decreasing the path length of the liquid flow within activated carbon the liquid profile inside the rotor also took an egg shell like shape due to the centrifugal force 29 and therefore contributed to the decrease in path length with increasing rotational speed the depth of the egg shell increased and path length decreases further in this case the increase in mass transfer coefficient due to increasing centrifugal force 6 cannot compensate for the effect of decrease in liquid flow path length however when the rotor speed was increased further the adsorption again increased in this case the increase in the mass transfer coefficient predominated over the decrease in path length due to displacement of the activated carbon and the water profile towards the outer wall of the rotor 5 feed rate is one of the parameters that can affect the adsorption of arsenic it was observed from fig 5 that there is an increasing trend in the s n ratio with the increase in feed rate higher feed rate increases the probability of contact between the activated carbon and liquid which in turn increases the adsorption of arsenic 30 in addition the increasing trend of s n ratio was also observed in case of packing density with increasing amount of activated carbon the packing was more compact and there was less distortion of the pack during high speed rotation this ensures that the path length travelled by the liquid was maintained high in comparison to low compaction where less quantity of activated carbon was used the initial increasing trend of s n ratio with increasing concentration was due to the fact that with increasing concentration more arsenic was available for adsorption however increase in concentration from 150 ppm to 200 ppm results in a reduced s n ratio as shown in fig 5 this was possibly due to the saturation of arsenic on the activated carbon causing the reduction in the removal efficiency hence at very high concentration the adsorption was not feasible ph played a significant role in case of arsenic adsorption it was observed that at ph of 2 the s n ratio was very low and it increased substantially at ph 3 and remained almost the same at ph 4 and ph 5 the measured redox potential of the solutions were found to be between 0 7 v 0 75 v according to the eh ph diagram of arsenic given in fig 6 the main species at ph 2 is neutral h3aso4 and the main species at ph 3 5 is h2aso4 at lower ph the surface of the activated carbon becomes highly protonated at ph 3 as the negatively charged arsenic species predominated the electrostatic force of attraction between the protonated surface of activated carbon and the charged species allowed

highest s n ratio was observed at level 2 for ph and level 2 for feed rate for packing density the s n ratio at level 1 and level 2 are almost similar therefore the fine tuning experiment suggest that the optimised best setting for the arsenic removal in rpb is ph of 3 feed rate of 45 l h and packing density of 357 kg m3 while the rotating speed is 1600 rpm and the initial concentration is 50 ppm according to these fine tuning experiments it was observed that the initial best setting was not exactly accurate when the range was narrowed down more accurate best settings were obtained the

halenda bjh and fourier transform infrared ftir techniques filtration experiments were used as the purification technique while fly ash clay and their mixtures fly ash clay 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 ratios were used as adsorbents the fly ash showed higher pore size with lower surface area than clay siloxane silicate and silanol were the major functional groups that exist in the adsorbents clay consisted of muscovite orthoclase quartz and kyanite while fly ash consisted of mullite sillimanite quartz and hematite contaminated water was simulated and allowed to have contact with the adsorbents at contact times of 10 30 min total dissolved solid tds ph and turbidity of water before and after filtration was determined and recorded the increase in the composite ratio showed an increase in ph tds conductivity and a decrease in turbidity removed from the water the results obtained from the tests further showed that 1 2 ratio was the most efficient with highest turbidity removal of 97 6 in 20

oil filtration fly ash 1 introduction the contamination of ground water by crude oil has become a widespread problem in nigeria and some parts of the world research has shown that an average of 83 million barrels of crude oil spills occurred per year from 1994 to 1996 in the united states each spilling accounted for an average of about 50 000 barrels of crude oil 1 petroleum derived contaminants represent one of the most common sources of environmental degradation globally the hydrocarbon molecules that make up crude oil and petroleum products are highly toxic to humans plants soils and many organisms crude oil also contains trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen compounds which are dangerous and can react with the environment and or volatile organic compounds voc to produce secondary poisonous chemicals sox and nox 2 in nigeria the department of petroleum resources dpr reported that between 1976 and 1996 1 89 out of 2 4 million barrels of crude oil produced was spilled into the environment in the niger delta 3 an understanding of the effects of organic contaminants such as crude oil and gasoline in the subsurface is essential in designing innovative and cost effective remedial solutions to purify oil contaminated water in rural areas where pollution is prevalent the quality of water whether it is used for irrigation drinking or recreational purposes is important for health in every part of the world water quality can have a major impact on health both through outbreaks of waterborne diseases and by contributing to the rates at which diseases spread the impact of various substances such as organic humic acid fumic acid and hydrocarbons and inorganic pollutants heavy metals insecticides pesticides etc may result in low quality water with bad taste odor and turbidity and or pathogenic bacteria and viruses crude oil contaminated water creates health hazards that can promote environmental degradation in affected areas they serve as the major contributors to the burden of oil bearing communities in these areas diseases such as cancer and those that lead to renal failure are usually associated with crude oil contaminated water 3 crude oil contaminated water reduces soil fertility smothers economic trees and food crops by either killing them or reducing their yields and renders process water unfit for use in various chemical and pharmaceutical industries 4 the ingestion dermal contact and inhalation of spilled crude oil have some acute and long term health implications in the niger delta area of nigeria ingestion of spilled crude oil has led to cases of renal failure hepatoxicity hemotoxicity and cancer prevalence 3 therefore it has become necessary for those studying water its pollution and treatment to intervene by providing simple and cheaper methods of purifying the polluted water for human use and to also protect the aquatic ecosystem the use of mechanical skimming nanofiltration advanced oxidation and sorption processes which include adsorption and absorption processes 5 are some of the researchable techniques used for the purpose of purifying contaminated water 6 a careful study of these processes has shown that some of these methods have shortcomings which include high investment and maintenance costs secondary pollution and complicated procedure the aim of this research is to study on the purification of crude oil contaminated water using a mixed proportion of fly ash and clay a technique that is affordable and could be used by people in rural and urban crude oil water contaminated areas this research employed the adsorption process because of its simplicity of design and operation 2 experimental procedures 2 1 materials the crude oil sample used was obtained from warri refinery nigeria while the clay and fly ash were obtained from ngurore in adamawa state nigeria and south africa respectively a ph meter ph bta model was used in determining the relative concentration of ions in the water samples conductivity probe con bta model was used in determining the conductivity of the water samples as well as the total dissolved solutes in the water turbidity probe trb bta model was used to measure the extent of cloudiness of the water samples various measuring probes were used together with vernier computer interface and logger pro in conducting the water quality tests 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 characterization of adsorbents the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis and barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size and volume analysis were used to determine the surface area pore size and pore volume of the fly ash and clay samples a detailed procedure of the bet bjh used was given by adams et al 7 the chemical compositions and microstructural analysis of the fly ash clay and their mixtures were determined by scanning electron microscopy tescan hrsem coupled with an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the functional groups confirming the bonding in all the tested samples were obtained using perkin elmer south africa 100 spectrometer ftir atr system the fourier transform infrared ftir characteristic peaks were recorded in wave numbers from 650 to 3500 cm 1 the mineralogical properties of the samples were studied using x ray diffraction xrd system rigaku ultimaiv south africa each sample was scanned from 2θ ranging from 5 to 90 2 2 2 water purification and analysis crude oil contaminated water was simulated using crude oil and water in ratio 3 7 the mixture was heated and stirred for about 30 min to ensure a homogeneous mixture at a temperature of 100 c filtration method was used as the purification technique and fly ash 20 g clay 20 g and their mixture fly ash clay ratios 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 were used as filter aids the contaminated water sample was allowed to have contacts with the filter aids at contact times of between 10 and 30 min while taking water samples for testing every 5 min total dissolved solid tds ph and turbidity of water before and after filtration were determined and recorded the water flow rate was obtained using eq 1 for different proportions of the adsorbents 1 q v t where q is the volumetric flow rate v is volume and t is time 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of fly ash clay and their mixtures 3 1 1 sem eds and bet bjh results the surface areas of fly ash and clay samples were obtained to be 0 6163 m2 g and 19 85 m2 g respectively the surface area of the clay falls within the range for kaolinite clays 10 20 m2 g 8 the higher surface area exhibited by the clay compared to that of the fly ash is an indication that clay will have higher tendency to remove contaminants from water than fly ash 9 the fly ash had a pore volume of 0 0018 cm3 g and pore size of 35 56 nm while clay exhibited 0 0270 cm3 g pore volume and 8 44 nm pore size the lower pore size shown by the clay indicates that clay will show lower flow rate compared to the fly ash despite its higher pore volume fly ash particles are spherical in shape with a smooth surface texture and different sizes as seen in the sem micrographs presented in fig 1 the microstructure of the clay shows compacted cluster particles of clay with different shapes and sizes as seen in fig 1 the micrographs of the mixtures of fly ash and clay show microstructures of both fly ash and clay with fly ash embedded in the clay clusters the higher the amount of fly ash in the mixture the more embedded the fly ash particles in the clay clusters and the smaller the fly ash particles in the mixture the compositions of fly ash clay and their mixtures are shown in table 1 the eds results show sio2 and al2o3 to be dominant in all the samples with clay showing the highest amount of sio2 followed by ratios 2 1 sample fly ash has more al2o3 compared to the other samples table 1 there are certain compounds which were found in clay but were not in fly ash these include p2o5 cl cr2o3 mno zro2 and bao the mixture with more fly ash 2 1 showed similar compositions as the fly ash 3 1 2 ftir the ftir spectra of the fly ash clay and their mixture 1 1 are shown in fig 2 the spectra of clay and the fly ash clay 1 1 show similarities in their peaks with differences in the wave numbers of the peaks the figure indicates broad band between 1500 and 2500 cm 1 in all the spectra the band seen at 1050 cm 1 on the fly ash spectrum is ascribed to siosi asymmetric stretching vibration while that at 1293 cm 1 is due to sio stretching and the peak at 769 cm 1 on the clay spectrum can be attributed to alo vibrations the peak at 782 cm 1 on 1 1 spectrum is vibrations of valence bands of sioal 10 the peak at 1069 cm 1 on the fly ash clay mixture is attributed to si o al bonding this bonding was found to be of stronger intensity than in fly ash and the clay 999 cm 1 the band present at 2484 and 2920 cm 1 clay spectrum and 2472 and 2907 cm 1 1 1 spectrum correspond to ch stretching absorption while the peak at 2843 cm 1 on the clay spectrum is attributed to the aliphatic ch2 asymmetric stretching the h2o bending vibration is found at 1652 cm 1 1 1 spectrum 10 it was reported by ahmaruzzaman and gupta 11 that the presence of silicates siloxane si o si and silanol si oh enhance adsorption 3 1 3 xrd fig 3 shows the diffraction pattern of the fly ash clay and their mixtures the fly ash showed crystalline peaks in at approximately diffraction angles 2θ 17 2 19 8 26 5 35 2 40 8 60 6 and 76 2 as shown in fig 3a d these peaks were attributed to mullite al6si2o13 quartz sio2 quartz sio2 hematite fe2o3 sillimanite al2sio5 mullite al6si2o13 and quartz sio2 respectively this results corroborate the results obtained by other researcher 12 13 the minerals present in the clay include kyanite al2sio5 quartz sio2 muscovite na0 28k0 725ca0 004 and orthoclase kalsi3o8 all the peaks obtained for the fly ash clay mixtures were similar to those of clay this could be due to the fact that fly ash spheres were embedded in the clusters of clay particles as seen in the sem micrographs fig 1 3 2 flow rates fig 4 shows the water flow rates obtained using eq 1 it was observed that the 2 1 fly ash clay adsorbent ratio exhibited the highest flow rate followed by fly ash while the 1 2 fly ash clay adsorbent ratio showed the lowest flow rate the high flow rates observed in the 2 1 ratio and fly ash was due to the high ratio of fly ash in the composite the low water retention capacity and pore size 35 56 nm of fly ash also allows easy flow of water through its pore despite its lower pore volume 0 0018 cm3 g when compared to that of the clay used 0 0270 cm3 g with pore size of 8 44 nm on the other hand the composite with ratio 1 2 exhibited the lowest flow rate as a result of the higher amount of clay in it the flow rate obtained for the clay sample was a bit higher than ratio 1 2 clay has high water retention capacity thus it will first absorb water into its pores and after saturation the water will start to flow 14 this leads to lower flow rates in clay and the composites containing more clay samples 3 3 tds analysis total dissolved solids tds include ions dissolved organic matter and sand particles the analysis of tds is important in water quality analysis because it also helps in determining the purity of water high tds shows that water is impure and can have toxic effects when used for instance depending on the ionic properties excess tds would have toxic effects on fish and fish eggs 15 the tds value of the simulated water was 148 mg l table 1 shows the tds values of the water samples after filtration the results showed that the filtrates contained higher tds compared to the untreated water after the first 10 min of treatment where the tds values were lower than the initial water tds value the filtrate obtained from 1 2 ratio had lower tds compared to composites with 2 1 1 1 ratios clay and fly ash the lowest tds values were obtained in 10 min of the tests it can be seen from table 2 that tds increased with increase in time up to 20 min and then it decreased this indicated that as the contact time increased solids from the composites dissolved in the water resulting in higher tds until the pores start to clog thereafter a decrease in tds was observed the tds of filtrate from clay was also lower than the one from fly ash the filtrate from fly ash showed the highest tds values at higher contact times this could be attributed to the fact that fly ash is ash and more soluble in water than clay 16 this analysis shows that composite containing 1 2 ratios is more efficient for the purification of crude oil contaminated water in terms of tds present in water at the lowest contact time since it produced lower tds in the water samples than the other adsorbents 3 4 turbidity removal from water high water turbidity has the tendency to decrease the amount of sunlight entering surface water as a result of suspended particles 17 while highly turbid water can be detrimental to an aquatic ecosystem it is incorrect to assume that clear water is always healthy slightly turbid water can be perfectly healthy while clear water could contain unseen toxins or unhealthy levels of nutrients 17 for this research the turbidity of water before treatment was 292 ntu table 3 shows the turbidity removal results obtained during the 30 min filtration test and the percentage turbidity removal in 10 min of the test is presented in fig 5 it was observed that the 1 2 ratio had the lowest turbidity values of 38 7 7 7 1 97 removal 8 5 and 8 8 ntu at contact times 10 15 20 25 and 30 min respectively as seen in tables 3 and 4 the values which are bold in table 4 show the best turbidity removal for each sample about 97 6 turbidity removal was achieved in 20 min using ratio 1 2 there was generally an initial decrease in turbidity of water up to 15 min using all the composites with the exception of the 1 2 ratios that decreased up to 20 min a fluctuation in turbidity of the filtrates was observed after 15 mins where increase and decrease in turbidity of the filtrate were obtained similar to the results obtained from tds as the contact time increases there is a possibility that the solids will dissolve in the water resulting in an increase in water turbidity fig 5 shows that a composite with 1 2 ratios exhibited the highest turbidity removal in 10 min followed by clay while fly ash showed the least turbidity removal in 10 min these results showed that clay which has a surface area of 19 85 m2 g has a higher tendency to remove turbidity from water compared to fly ash which has a surface area of 0 6163 m2 g clay and composite with 2 1 ratio were able to remove turbidity of 96 5 and 96 7 respectively in 15 min the composite with 1 2 ratio 1 1 ratio and fly ash removed 97 6 highest turbidity removed 94 1 and 94 5 respectively in 20 30 and 20 min respectively table 4 the mechanism of dissolved solids turbidity and tds removal from crude oil contaminated water using adsorbents fly ash clay and their mixtures was by adsorption of the dissolved solids molecules from the water on the adsorbents surfaces this process is a mass transfer operation in which a solid material can selectively remove dissolved substances from an aqueous solution by attracting the dissolved solute to its surface 18 the clay has interlayer spacing in which the water molecule lodged when clay is hydrated while the contaminants adhere to its surface the adsorptive property of clay is due to the negative charge found on the clay surface which attracts positively charged contaminants to it the bond formed between the dissolved solids and the adsorbent s surface in adsorption is fairly loose thus the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent will decrease over time interlayer cations can be displaced by other cations from aqueous solution and or other particles embedded in the clay interlayer spacing to give ion exchange reaction this is seen in the exchange of si clay si o si with al 1 1 ratio si o al in the bonding that exist between fly ash and clay 1 1 3 5 ph of filtrates the measure of the ph of water is very important as it helps in the indication of water quality because small changes in water ph can endanger humans plants and animals the initial ph of water before treatment was 11 40 table 5 shows the measured ph values of the water samples for the 30 min filtration tests while fig 6 shows the comparison of the ph values for the filtrates at 10 min of the test it was observed that the composite ratio 1 2 has a ph value of 8 21 at 10 min and the results indicated that this composite exhibited the lowest ph values throughout the tests filtrates obtained from the fly ash test generally showed the highest ph values and this could indicate the alkalinity of the fly ash used comparing the optimum turbidity removal of each adsorbent composites with 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 ratios having their optimum turbidity removals at 30 20 and 15 min respectively showed ph values at this time to be 10 62 8 78 and 10 45 respectively for the composites also at 15 and 20 min clay and fly ash at their optimum turbidity removals showed ph values of 8 93 and 11 41 respectively the lowest ph 8 10 value was obtained at 30 mins in the composite with 1 2 ratio and highest 11 88 at 20 min considering the acceptable ph ranges for drinking water 6 5 8 5 aquatic life 6 5 9 0 and that of ground water 6 0 8 5 it can be seen that the 8 21 ph of the 1 2 composite ratio at 10 min meets these functional criteria 4 conclusions the clay exhibited higher surface area and pore volume but lower pore size compared to the clay sample the microstructures of the fly ash clay mixtures showed that fly ash spheres were embedded in the clusters of clay particles and eds showed that all the adsorbents were dominantly contained sio2 and al2o3 the clay and the fly ash clay mixtures showed similar diffraction peaks with kyanite muscovite quartz and orthoclase as the minerals present in them fly ash constituted of quartz mullite sillimanite and hematite ftir showed siloxane silicate and silanol as the functional groups and bonding that exist in the adsorbents considering the adsorption capacity of the fly ash clay and the fly ash clay mixtures 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 in this study the fly ash clay mixtures showed more efficiency compared to the clay and fly ash used independently clay showed higher turbidity removal than fly ash during the 30 min test and the ph values also showed the same trend the optimum performances showed the composite with 1 2 to be more efficient in the first 20 min with turbidity removal of 97 6 ph of 8 78 and tds of 383 0 mg l the lowest ph 8 10 was obtained from the fly ash clay mixture 1 2 ratio and the highest 11 88 from the fly ash sample generally 1 2 was more efficient as it purified the crude oil contaminated water faster compared to other adsorbents used and could be selected and possibly further modified

halenda bjh and fourier transform infrared ftir techniques filtration experiments were used as the purification technique while fly ash clay and their mixtures fly ash clay 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 ratios were used as adsorbents the fly ash showed higher pore size with lower surface area than clay siloxane silicate and silanol were the major functional groups that exist in the adsorbents clay consisted of muscovite orthoclase quartz and kyanite while fly ash consisted of mullite sillimanite quartz and hematite contaminated water was simulated and allowed to have contact with the adsorbents at contact times of 10 30 min total dissolved solid tds ph and turbidity of water before and after filtration was determined and recorded the increase in the composite ratio showed an increase in ph tds conductivity and a decrease in turbidity removed from the water the results obtained from the tests further showed that 1 2 ratio was the most efficient with highest turbidity removal of 97 6 in 20 min ratio 1 2 also showed an average turbidity removal of 86 9 in 10 min and an optimal ph value of 8 the tds values for this ratio were lower than 500 mg l the composite with 2 1 ratio also had optimum turbidity removal of 96 7 in 15 min with a ph value of 10 45 and tds value of 763 5 mg l clay was observed to have better purification capacity than fly ash keywords contamination clay crude oil filtration fly ash 1 introduction the contamination of ground water by crude oil has become a widespread problem in nigeria and some parts of the world research has shown that an average of 83 million barrels of crude oil spills occurred per year from 1994 to 1996 in the united states each spilling accounted for an average of about 50 000 barrels of crude oil 1 petroleum derived contaminants represent one of the most common sources of environmental degradation globally the hydrocarbon molecules that make up crude oil and petroleum products are highly toxic to humans plants soils and many organisms crude oil also contains trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen compounds which are dangerous and can react with the environment and or volatile organic compounds voc to produce secondary poisonous chemicals sox and nox 2 in nigeria the department of petroleum resources dpr reported that between 1976 and 1996 1 89 out of 2 4 million barrels of crude oil produced was spilled into the environment in the niger delta 3 an understanding of the effects of organic contaminants such as crude oil and gasoline in the subsurface is essential in designing innovative and cost effective remedial solutions to purify oil contaminated water in rural areas where pollution is prevalent the quality of water whether it is used for irrigation drinking or recreational purposes is important for health in every part of the world water quality can have a major impact on health both through outbreaks of waterborne diseases and by contributing to the rates at which diseases spread the impact of various substances such as organic humic acid fumic acid and hydrocarbons and inorganic pollutants heavy metals insecticides pesticides etc may result in low quality water with bad taste odor and turbidity and or pathogenic bacteria and viruses crude oil contaminated water creates health hazards that can promote environmental degradation in affected areas they serve as the major contributors to the burden of oil bearing communities in these areas diseases such as cancer and those that lead to renal failure are usually associated with crude oil contaminated water 3 crude oil contaminated water reduces soil fertility smothers economic trees and food crops by either killing them or reducing their yields and renders process water unfit for use in various chemical and pharmaceutical industries 4 the ingestion dermal contact and inhalation of spilled crude oil have some acute and long term health implications in the niger delta area of nigeria ingestion of spilled crude oil has led to cases of renal failure hepatoxicity hemotoxicity and cancer prevalence 3 therefore it has become necessary for those studying water its pollution and treatment to intervene by providing simple and cheaper methods of purifying the polluted water for human use and to also protect the aquatic ecosystem the use of mechanical skimming nanofiltration advanced oxidation and sorption processes which include adsorption and absorption processes 5 are some of the researchable techniques used for the purpose of purifying contaminated water 6 a careful study of these processes has shown that some of these methods have shortcomings which include high investment and maintenance costs secondary pollution and complicated procedure the aim of this research is to study on the purification of crude oil contaminated water using a mixed proportion of fly ash and clay a technique that is affordable and could be used by people in rural and urban crude oil water contaminated areas this research employed the adsorption process because of its simplicity of design and operation 2 experimental procedures 2 1 materials the crude oil sample used was obtained from warri refinery nigeria while the clay and fly ash were obtained from ngurore in adamawa state nigeria and south africa respectively a ph meter ph bta model was used in determining the relative concentration of ions in the water samples conductivity probe con bta model was used in determining the conductivity of the water samples as well as the total dissolved solutes in the water turbidity probe trb bta model was used to measure the extent of cloudiness of the water samples various measuring probes were used together with vernier computer interface and logger pro in conducting the water quality tests 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 characterization of adsorbents the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis and barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size and volume analysis were used to determine the surface area pore size and pore volume of the fly ash and clay samples a detailed procedure of the bet bjh used was given by adams et al 7 the chemical compositions and microstructural analysis of the fly ash clay and their mixtures were determined by scanning electron microscopy tescan hrsem coupled with an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the functional groups confirming the bonding in all the tested samples were obtained using perkin elmer south africa 100 spectrometer ftir atr system the fourier transform infrared ftir characteristic peaks were recorded in wave numbers from 650 to 3500 cm 1 the

analysis crude oil contaminated water was simulated using crude oil and water in ratio 3 7 the mixture was heated and stirred for about 30 min to ensure a homogeneous mixture at a temperature of 100 c filtration method was used as the purification technique and fly ash 20 g clay 20 g and their mixture fly ash clay ratios 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 were used as filter aids the contaminated water sample was allowed to have contacts with the filter aids at contact times of between 10 and 30 min while taking water samples for testing every 5 min total dissolved solid tds ph and turbidity of water before and after filtration were determined and recorded the water flow rate was obtained using eq 1 for different proportions of the adsorbents 1 q v t where q is the volumetric flow rate v is volume and t is time 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of fly ash clay and their mixtures 3 1 1 sem eds and bet bjh results the surface areas of fly ash and clay samples were obtained to be 0 6163 m2 g and 19 85 m2 g respectively the surface area of the clay falls within the range for kaolinite clays 10 20 m2 g 8 the higher surface area exhibited by the clay compared to that of the fly ash is an indication that clay will have higher tendency to remove contaminants from water than fly ash 9 the fly ash had a pore volume of 0 0018 cm3 g and pore size of 35 56 nm while clay exhibited 0 0270 cm3 g pore volume and 8 44 nm pore size the lower pore size shown by the clay indicates that clay will show lower flow rate compared to the fly ash despite its higher pore volume fly ash particles are spherical in shape with a smooth surface texture and different sizes as seen in the sem micrographs presented in fig 1 the microstructure of the clay shows compacted cluster particles of clay with different shapes and sizes as seen in fig 1 the micrographs of the mixtures of fly ash and clay show microstructures of both fly ash and clay with fly ash embedded in the clay clusters the higher the amount of fly ash in the mixture the more embedded the fly ash particles in the clay clusters and the smaller the fly ash particles in the mixture the compositions of fly ash clay and their mixtures are shown in table 1 the eds results show sio2 and al2o3 to be dominant in all the samples with clay showing the highest amount of sio2 followed by ratios 2 1 sample fly ash has more al2o3 compared to the other samples table 1 there are certain compounds which were found in clay but were not in fly ash these include p2o5 cl cr2o3 mno zro2 and bao the mixture with more fly ash 2 1 showed similar

differences in the wave numbers of the peaks the figure indicates broad band between 1500 and 2500 cm 1 in all the spectra the band seen at 1050 cm 1 on the fly ash spectrum is ascribed to siosi asymmetric stretching vibration while that at 1293 cm 1 is due to sio stretching and the peak at 769 cm 1 on the clay spectrum can be attributed to alo vibrations the peak at 782 cm 1 on 1 1 spectrum is vibrations of valence bands of sioal 10 the peak at 1069 cm 1 on the fly ash clay mixture is attributed to si o al bonding this bonding was found to be of stronger intensity than in fly ash and the clay 999 cm 1 the band present at 2484 and 2920 cm 1 clay spectrum and 2472 and 2907 cm 1 1 1 spectrum correspond to ch stretching absorption while the peak at 2843 cm 1 on the clay spectrum is attributed to the aliphatic ch2 asymmetric stretching the h2o bending vibration is found at 1652 cm 1 1 1 spectrum 10 it was reported by ahmaruzzaman and gupta 11 that the presence of silicates

725ca0 004 and orthoclase kalsi3o8 all the peaks obtained for the fly ash clay mixtures were similar to those of clay this could be due to the fact that fly ash spheres were embedded in the clusters
