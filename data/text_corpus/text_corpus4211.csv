21055,tidal turbines represent a new frontier for extracting energy from a huge potential of renewable source such as the tides despite the technology being mature enough new solutions aimed at improving the machines efficiency with reduced environmental impact and installation costs are currently under investigation a novel tidal turbine characterized by being self balanced and not requiring structures and foundations was recently proposed the machine geometry presents an open center which affects the flow field and improves the machine performance in terms of extracted power and power coefficient at the best of authors knowledge despite being open center turbines produced and installed an evaluation of the fluid dynamics effects of the open center on machine performance is still missing the main objective of the present work is to fill this gap and to contribute to have a deeper insight in the flow field in the wake region and to investigate its effects on machine performance the analysis is carried out by means of a cfd tool for three different machine geometries the open center machine which is modeled in single rotor and double rotors configurations and the traditional wind like machine a comparison with literature experimental data is also included for validation purpose for each analyzed case the flow analysis is carried out for the optimal tip speed ratio a free stream velocity of 3 m s is selected for simulations and a scaled model of the turbine having the diameter of about 1m is considered the results show that the open center configurations allow the achievement of higher performance in terms of power coefficient and extracted power in comparison to the traditional wind like turbines in particular for the new double rotor prototype the estimated cp value is about 0 43 with improvements of about 15 with respect to traditional configurations moreover the corresponding increase in the extracted power which for 1m diameter prototype increases from 5 2 kw to 6 kw is achieved with a lighter machine the weight power ratio in fact reduces from about 2 kg kw for the standard machine configuration to 1 6 kg kw for the new double rotor prototype the improvements in machine performance are related to the fluid dynamics characteristics of the central opening this in fact causes a suction effect which contributes to reduce the energy losses due to radial and tangential kinetic energy displaced out from the rotor disk that for a standard machine amount to about 36 of the inlet kinetic energy only part of these energy losses is recovered as mechanical power to the turbine while the remaining part increases the flow kinetic energy lost in the open center region the amount of energy recovered as mechanical power at the turbine increases considerably in the double rotor configuration where besides the suction effect of the open center the external counter rotating rotor gives the major contribution to the recovery of the kinetic energy lost in tangential and radial components of the inner rotor which is then reduced down to 12 5 keywords tidal current marine turbine power coefficient cfd analysis double rotor bem

momentum cfd computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction owing to the increasing concerns about environmental issues and to the even more severe regulations on co2 emissions deriving from the use of fossil fuels the production of electricity from renewable sources is widely spreading in particular research in the exploitation of energy from marine currents has undergone considerable improvements in the last decade due to two main factors the first one is the great potential to generate large amounts of electricity from tidal energy technologies it is estimated that the exploitable marine current power with the available technology is about 75 gw in the world and about 11 gw in europe boye et al 2013 the second one is the high predictability of the tidal current resource over other renewable energy sources marine tidal currents were predicted with 98 accuracy for decades benelghali et al 2007 the technology for extracting energy from tidal currents is constantly evolving and includes both turbine systems and non turbine systems oscillating hydrofoils flutter vanes sails with reference to turbine systems satisfactory levels have been reached in terms of performance and reliability and a number of horizontal axis large scale turbines have been developed and industrialized zhou et al 2017 although many designs of tidal energy converters have been proposed over the years the configuration which has been more attractive for the industry and has seen the furthest advancement in terms of commercial scale deployment is the traditional 3 bladed horizontal axis design similar to its wind turbine counterpart allsop et al 2017 typical commercial turbines have variable pitch blades a diameter of 15 25 m and rated power 1 2 mw one of the most recent projects which has seen the installation of three turbines of a 6 mw array in the pentland firth scotland is the meygen project phase 1a meygen 2016 meygen 2016 in order to make this technology even more viable and competitive new approaches for enhancing the hydrodynamic performance are currently under study in order to improve the working efficiency of tidal stream turbines blades optimization is often required after the preliminary design and aims at increasing lift and reducing drag forces which advantageously affect torque and thrust on the turbine optimization method is mostly based on genetic algorithm which is basically aimed at determining the distribution of blade chord length twist angle and thickness along the radius sale et al 2009 goundar and ahmed 2013 another way to improve hydrodynamic efficiency relies in the adoption of contra rotating rotors which allow the achievement of enhanced performance than single rotor clarke et al 2007 huang et al 2016 with improvements in the maximum power coefficient up to 13 this is mainly due to the lack of swirling velocity component in the downstream of the rear rotor moreover increased power output is obtained owing to the presence of two rotors and advantages in terms of structural design and mooring arrangements are achieved owing to the near zero reaction torque on the supporting structure turbines with diffusers and ducts have been also studied and developed to improve turbine efficiency thorpe 2005 jones and chao 2009 gaden and bibeau 2010 the duct in fact increases the flow velocity at the throat where the rotor is placed increasing therefore the energy that can be captured by turbine blades of a given diameter this keeps the size of the complex moving components to a minimum thus reducing manufacturing as well as operating and maintenance costs finally new non conventional geometries have been developed and industrialized dcns openhydro have installed a pair of 500 kw rated capacity turbines as a demonstration array in paimpol bréhat northern france in collaboration with edf openhydro ltd cape sharp the turbine design which is characterized by high solidity blades is ducted and presents an open center this contributes to further improve the machine performance providing a suction effect to accelerate the flow through the turbine and increasing the power take off while maintaining a high structural strength technological evolution cannot disregard of the improvements in numerical modeling and experimental tests which are fundamental in order to gain insight into the turbines hydrodynamic assessment the simpler approaches proposed over the years for the design of a turbine which determine the overall performance similarly as for wind turbines are mainly based on the blade element momentum theory bemt burton et al 2000 according to this theory the rotor is modeled as a set of isolated two dimensional blade elements to which the hydrodynamics theory can be applied individually the integration of the elemental forces over the blade length determines the thrust and torque applied to the rotor moreover by means of simple correlations the bemt permits the design of the blades in terms of chord variation and pitch angle along the radius despite this method being based on quite simplified assumptions its great advantage consists in the achievement of a satisfactory level of accuracy in spite of low computational requirements which make this approach particularly suitable for engineering assessments especially during the design stage for this reason as for wind turbines this approach is equally adopted for tidal turbines the design criteria however taking into account the different working fluids and the environment winter 2011 the good predictive capabilities of this approach were demonstrated in several works where however 3 bladed turbines are modeled among the most recent literature coiro et al 2006 experimentally validated numerical codes based on standard glauert s blade element theory modified following prandtl s theory and the higher order correction method to predict the performance of a horizontal axis hydro turbine batten et al 2007 and bahaj et al 2008 developed simulation tools based on blade element momentum theory which were validated with model scale experiments on a model 800 mm diameter turbine in a cavitation tunnel and a towing tank the results obtained in terms of shaft power and thrust generated by the turbine for a series of blade pitch settings and speeds demonstrated that this theory provides a satisfactory representation of the experimental turbine performance characteristics availability of such models for different geometries in particular for high solidity and open center models is however missing moreover limitations in the adoption of bem theory rely in the unpredictability of flow field variables and wake characteristics more complex high fidelity models used to perform detailed hydrodynamic assessment and to determine wake formation are based on the use of the computational fluid dynamics cfd this technique is widely spreading thanks to the development of numerical methods and to the increasing availability of supercomputing resources cfd applications have been recently abundant and studies were carried out for the analysis of three dimensional turbines mason jones et al 2008 kinnas and xu 2009 and for the wake effects harrison et al 2009 lee et al 2010 the analysis of the wake behind a turbine and in particular of the near wake is required to investigate the interaction effects between flow and a turbine which are useful to further understand the power extracting mechanism from a tidal turbine several computational approaches have been proposed in order to investigate the near wake and these can be classified into a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models coupled to multiple reference frame mrf or to sliding mesh techniques li and çalişal 2010 liu et al 2016 b the so called actuator models harrison et al 2010 c hybrid models like rans equations coupled to blade element methodology rans bem belloni et al 2017 turnock et al 2011 both the mrf and sliding mesh techniques attempt to simulate the actual geometry of the turbine rotor so that they can represent the three dimensional 3d wake structure more realistically than other methods can do moreover they catch the helical vortex of the wake induced by the blade tips better the drawback relies in the computational effort which is expensive when compared to other techniques as very fine grid around the turbine rotor to capture flow details is needed a less computationally expensive approach is the actuator disc models adm according to which the real geometry is replaced by the set of reaction forces that it produces the approach was proposed and validated through experimental tests in bahaj et al 2007 myers and bahaj 2009 who demonstrated however that the obtained downstream results of the near field wake within 7 diameters distance were not realistic finally the rans bem method has been proved to be powerful in predicting output power of the turbine and flow characteristics of the wake allsop et al 2017 belloni et al 2017 however this method could not represent the blade tip vortices of a rotating rotor and thereby a fast recovery of the velocity in the downstream was obtained batten et al 2013 a novel turbine prototype was recently proposed by the authors in barbarelli et al 2014 2018 lo zupone et al 2017 where detailed geometry description and working principle are given the turbine is characterized by being a high solidity open center horizontal axis tidal turbine which similarly to openhydro ltd cape sharp is conceived with an open center in order to take advantage of an expected suction effect which accelerates the flow through the turbine moreover by eliminating the central area of the blade further advantages are expected owing to weight and drag which are held to a minimum the machine is also characterized by having two counter rotating rotors which as demonstrated in clarke et al 2007 huang et al 2016 can help improving hydrodynamic efficiency by reducing the swirling velocity component in the downstream of the rotors in this paper the assessment of the hydrodynamic performance of the novel prototype is presented as a first aspect a methodology of the blade design specifically developed for open center configurations is proposed the approach is based on bemt theory and a generalized iterative procedure based on 1 d approach is developed for evaluating the power coefficient with varying the tip speed ratio the work is completed by a full 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model coupled with multiple reference frame mrf in particular a near wake analysis which aims at evaluating the effects related to the presence of an open center in the design of non conventional tidal current turbines in comparison to the traditional wind like turbine configurations is presented despite being open center machines industrialized and installed detailed flow field analyses which demonstrate the beneficial effects of the open center on machine performance are very limited moreover by means of the near wake analysis the effects of the counter rotating rotors on the reduction of swirling velocity component are analyzed finally the energy distribution in the wake is evaluated in order to quantify the various contributions to the energy losses which help having further insight into interaction effects between flow and a turbine and are useful to further understand the power extracting mechanism from a tidal turbine the cfd numerical model is validated by means of literature experimental data morandi et al 2016 following a rigorous verification and validation procedure stern et al 2006 the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the machine geometry section 3 includes the criteria based on bemt theory for the blades design of the various machine configurations and presents the iterative procedure developed in matlab environment for assessing the machine performance by varying the tip speed ratio section 4 summarizes the cfd modeling criteria and model validation finally section 5 presents the achieved results for the various machine configurations 2 geometry the turbine used as a reference in the present work is a new open center prototype whose working principle is presented in barbarelli et al barbarelli et al 2014 2018 lo zupone et al 2017 it is designed with the aim to exploit tidal currents near to the coast by eliminating structures supports and foundations and by keeping the machine in equilibrium in the water in a correct position by a simple rope which is subject to a tensile stress in order to achieve this goal the turbine is designed with a proper geometrical configuration fig 1 in particular a central deflector maintains the machine always facing the flow and a vertical stabilizer connected to the stator by a vertical bar keeps the machine at the expected depth a built in permanent magnets generator is arranged into the stator the machine working principle is quite similar to a kite fig 1 b c the weight w reduced by the archimedes thrust t a and the rate of change of the axial momentum t are balanced by the lift l produced by the tidal current on the central deflector installed in the middle of the blade discs this force in turn tends to push off the turbine however the simultaneous action of the forces w t a t and of the reaction r of the rope allows the turbine to reach the equilibrium in a position related to the coast which remains unchanged with varying the flow velocity in this work a scale model having an external diameter of 1 12m is considered however real scale systems will consider for rotors between 10 12 m which are capable of delivering hundreds of kw the machine is designed in single and double rotor configurations the inner diameter is constrained by the internal deflector dimension in order to evaluate the fluid dynamic effects of the open center on the machine performance a comparison with a traditional full length blade machine obtained by adopting the design criteria as for the open center configuration is also included it is worth to observe that in this case a maximum of 6 blades can be considered for the fixed external rotor diameter in order to avoid blades interference the main geometric parameters for the investigated configurations are summarized in table 1 and their schematics are reported in fig 2 3 methodology in this section the blades design procedure widely discussed in barbarelli et al 2014 is briefly described for the sake of clarity the approach is based on the adoption of optimal design rules developed for wind turbines and revised for applications to the marine turbines in the present paper as a further step in machine characterization a 1 d model is developed in matlab environment for evaluating the machine performance under off design conditions by estimating the power coefficient c p for different values of the tip speed ratio λ 3 1 blades design the blades are designed through the relations of optimal blade design 2 4 which allow to obtain the radial dimensions of the two fundamental parameters the chord c and the angle of attack β once the value of tip speed ratio λ the number of blades b and the airfoil profile are selected burton et al 2000 2 c 1 b π d e λ c

angle between the relative velocity vector w and the tangential velocity u ωr 1 a being a the tangential flow induction factor fig 3 moreover μ is the parameter which describes the variation along the rotor radius r the choice of the parameters λ and b in eq 2 is carried out in order to maximize the power coefficient c p and is the key issue for optimizing the machine performance an implicit correlation between λ and b is given by the blade solidity 5 σ b l a d e a r e a b l a d e d i s c a r e a b c 2 π r m where c is the blade chord and r m is the mean radius fig 4 shows the solidity as a function of the tipspeed ratio for blades designed for an airfoil naca 4412 minniti 2010 the figure suggests that slow turbines which perform better for low flow velocities must be designed with a higher solidity than the fast ones which on the contrary operate better in those sites where the flow velocities are higher in the present case the site where the turbine is thought to be placed is characterized by a low stream velocity 3 m s therefore a low tip speed ratio must be chosen which implies a high blade solidity moreover the proper choice of λ is also carried out by taking account a set of hydrodynamic structural geometric and economic constraints once these parameters are selected the maximum c p is obtained with the following equation derived from the vortex cylinder theory combined with prandtl theory 6 c p 16 27 exp 0 3538 λ 1 2946 c d c l λ the blade lift coefficient c l can be obtained by means of the on line available tool javafoil https www mh aerotools by defining the blade aspect ratio ar which characterizes the squatness of the blade the attack angle α and the reynolds number the aspect ratio is defined as 7 a r b l a d e l e n g h t c h o r d l b c r where the blade length is obtained as the half difference between the inner and the outer rotor diameter d i and d e respectively the average chord c r at the mean rotor radius r m for defining the aspect ratio is obtained by considering the blade solidity eq 5 for blades having an airfoil naca 4412 profile the attack angle α is set to 5 minniti 2010 the reynolds number is evaluated by considering a stream velocity of 3 m s once obtained the c l value it is included in eq 1 and by applying equations 1 to 4 with varying the rotor radius r the blade design is achieved for the full length blade configuration fig 2 invested by a tidal current having a velocity of 3 m s the optimal tip speed ratio was found to be about 2 5 with a blade solidity σ 0 3 and b 6 the optimal c p value obtained for the aforementioned operating conditions through eq 6 is cp 0 38 3 2 1 d model for evaluating machine cp as a function of the tip speed ratio a 1 d model for the preliminary evaluation of the rotor performance in terms of power coefficient c p with varying the tip speed ratio λ is proposed the model inputs are blade geometry expressed in terms of chord c and pitch angle variation β along the radius and lift and drag coefficients as a function of the incidence angle α obtained by the software javafoils https www mh aerotools the following equations are implemented in the model the power coefficient is defined as the ratio between the turbine power p and the undisturbed power flux 8 c p p 1 2 ρ v 0 3 a r e f the reference area a ref can be evaluated by considering the total frontal area of the turbine or alternatively by considering the rotor area which for the open center configuration can be calculated as 9 a r o t o r π r e 2 r i 2 being r e and r i the outer and inner rotor radii respectively it is clear that normalizing power on a rotor leads to much higher power coefficients than by considering a disc with reference to fig 3 the relative flow velocity w and inflow angle ϕ are defined respectively as 10 w v 0 2 1 a ω 2 r 2 1 a 2 11 sin ϕ v 0 1 a w cos ϕ ω r 1 a w where a and a are the axial and tangential flow induction factors respectively ω is the rotor

to the external one r e by defining the turbine power as p qω the power coefficient c p can be calculated according to eq 8 the variation of the inflow angle ϕ and the incidence angle α along the radius are not known a priori therefore at the first iteration these parameter are set equal to zero and equations from 12 to 15 are solved calculating therefore a and a with these values eq 11 is solved for estimating the inflow angle ϕ this procedure is run iteratively until convergence is reached the results of the numerical 1 d model are reported in fig 5 both for the conventional case of the full length blades and for the single rotor open center configuration the figure shows that for both configurations the maximum power coefficient is achieved for λ 2 5 2 8 which is in accordance with the value selected for optimal blades design for the single rotor open center configuration a higher maximum c p value is achieved the proposed approach does not apply to the double rotor configuration where the interaction effects among the two counter rotating rotors are not modeled in such a case a cfd analysis is more suitable to be applied for the analysis of the machine c p with varying the tip speed ratio 4 cfd modeling numerical simulations are carried out with the commercial code fluent the use of a rotating reference frame allows the problem to be treated as steady hence time discretization is not needed in particular the multiple reference frame mrf approach is adopted to model the rotating components the use of this approach requires the subdivision of the computational domain into stationary and rotating zones which are separated by interfaces where appropriate transformations of the velocity vector and velocity gradients are performed to determine fluxes of mass momentum and other scalars the equations are discretized in space by employing a cell centered finite volume technique a pressure based algorithm is used to sequentially solve the discretized equations and the piso pressure velocity coupling scheme is adopted to enforce mass conservation resulting in a pressure correction equation second order upwind schemes and second order central differences are employed for discretization of convective and diffusion terms respectively turbulence is modeled by means of the two equations κ ε realizable model which in previous studies o doherty et al 2009 was demonstrated to achieve high level of accuracy in the simulations of the rotating flows with particular regard to horizontal axis tidal turbines 4 1 grids and boundary conditions for the considered machine configurations the corresponding computational domains are designed the whole computational domain is composed of two blocks which include the rotor subdomain and the background block the computational domain has a length of 9d and a radius of 3d where d represents the turbine diameter at the inlet a constant value of water velocity is applied and a no slip condition is enforced on the turbine blade surfaces the use of a periodic boundary condition on the domain sides allows the reduction of the computational effort unstructured mesh with tetrahedral cells is used in order to overcome the difficulty of generating the mesh around complex geometries grid refinement occurs in proximity of the blade surface near the leading edge trailing edge and blade tip fig 6 in particular shows the computational domains and the boundary conditions used in the current simulations for the open center configuration 4 2 cfd model validation a verification and validation v v analysis is carried out in order to quantify errors and uncertainties in cfd simulations stern et al 2006 the study is proposed for the full length blade configuration by using the power coefficient c p as a key parameter to evaluate the level of accuracy of the proposed numerical approach verification provides an estimation of the numerical errors given by iterative errors and grid and time step spacing errors in the present study iterative errors are negligible in comparison to the grid ones therefore grid uncertainty gives the main contribution to numerical uncertainty u sn moreover the simulations are carried out under steady conditions and no time step errors are considered hence only a grid dependence study is necessary the study is carried out on three meshes having a refinement ratio r 2 the grids dimensions for g 1 g 2 and g 3 are 1 0 0 71 and 0 5 m respectively the convergence ratio is defined as 17 r s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 being s 1 s 2 and s 3 the solutions corresponding to the fine medium and coarse grid respectively when monotonic convergence is achieved 0 r 1 the generalized richardson extrapolation is used for estimation of numerical error according to the following definition 18 δ r e ε 21 r p 1 where ε 21 s 2 s 1 r is the refinement ratio and p is the estimated order of accuracy calculated as 19 p l n s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 l n r when solutions are in the asymptotic range then p p th where p th is the theoretical order of accuracy of the numerical method in many cases especially for coarse grids and industrial applications solutions are far from the asymptotic range such that p is greater or smaller than p th stern et al 2006 use the correction factor c g as a metric for defining the distance of solutions from the asymptotic range 20 c g r p 1 r p t h 1 in this case where c g is sufficiently greater than 1 the grid uncertainty u g is estimated as 21 u g c g δ r e 1 c g δ r e the results of the verification study for the full length blade configuration are summarized in table 2 which shows that monotonic convergence is reached by increasing the mesh quality r 1 that the order of accuracy p eq 19 is higher than the theoretical order of accuracy of the numerical method p th 2 and the correction factor c g eq 20 which is higher than 1 indicates that the solution is far from the asymptotic range therefore the uncertainty due to grid spacing can be calculated according to eq 21 this uncertainty u g is about 0 69 of the finest grid solution and is acceptably small u sn therefore is due to grid spacing only and can be further reduced by increasing the grid refinement validation allows the estimation of modeling errors by a comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data the validation uncertainty u v is computed as 22 u v 2 u s n 2 u d 2 where u d is the uncertainty of the experimental data the comparison error e defined as the difference between the experimental data d and the simulation results s gives a metrics of the solution accuracy if e is within the u v interval the solution is validated at the u v level otherwise the sign and magnitude of e are used to estimate the error deriving from the modeling assumptions and improvements can be made on the model to date a machine prototype has not yet been realized and no experimental data are available therefore for validation purpose a tidal turbine having similar geometrical properties as the full length blade configuration and operating under the same conditions has been considered as a benchmark and the power coefficient c p was adopted for comparison the tested machine is a scale model of the sabella d10 tidal turbine having an external diameter of 402 mm and a hub diameter of 87 4 mm morandi et al 2016 a high degree of geometrical similarity is observed for both geometries in fact both machines have 6 blades and for both cases the blade length amounts to 78 of the external diameter however the machines differ in two main aspects the diameter and the blade section profile which in the proposed case is a naca 4412 and in morandi et al 2016 has an elliptical section as for diameter no significant effects on power coefficient are expected in fact from literature mason jones et al 2012 for two geometrically similar machines the power coefficient is a function of the reynolds number and of the tip speed ratio 23 c p f r e t s r therefore if the geometries are completely similar and if the machines operate with the same reynolds number and the same tip speed ratio the same c p is expected for both diameters moreover in high reynolds number flows i e re of the order 106 it is not unusual for the independent variable group to become independent of reynolds number which simplifies significantly the scaling process the operating conditions adopted for the proposed prototype v 0 3 0 m s λ 1 5 4 5 are included in the range of operating conditions selected for the scale model where the performance analysis was carried out for a range of the tip speed ratio from 0 0 to 4 8 and for inflow velocities ranging from 2 26 to 3 00 m s therefore reynolds number falls in the range 1 3 106 both for the prototype and for scale model this indicates that the effects of a different diameter on the c p can be neglected on the contrary the element which can significantly affect the c p is the blade section profile therefore in the validation process some differences in power coefficient between both geometries are expected it is worth pointing out that the study is carried out with the main purpose to estimate how far from realistic ranges the numerical c p values are in order to evaluate their reliability to this aim a comparison between the experimental data and the current results for an inflow velocity of 3 m s is plotted in fig 7 it can be observed that the trend of cfd simulations shows a quite similar behavior as experimental data especially in the range of high turbine performance c p 0 3 on the contrary larger differences occur at low and high tip speed values owing to the different blade section which in the experiments is a symmetric elliptic section while in the simulations it is a naca 4412 airfoil in particular at low tip speed values a rotor stall condition is more favorable for the elliptic blade section at high tip speed ratios the effects of a lower blade efficiency of the elliptic blade profile are more severe the achieved results are quite encouraging to proceed with validation the verification and validation study is carried out for the operating condition λ 2 5 the results of the validation procedure are reported in table 3 which shows that the major contribution to validation uncertainty u v eq 22 relies in the experimental data while the contribution due to numerical simulations is negligible the comparison error e is lower than the validation uncertainty which indicates that the numerical solution is validated at the u v level in this case it is not possible to discriminate between numerical and modeling contributions however an uncertainty level of about 5 6 for the current cfd simulations can be considered acceptable for the complexity of the involved flow physics and the proposed cfd model will be adopted with a good level of confidence for the open center machine configurations in conclusion the developed cfd model can be considered as a valid tool for predicting the performance of the newly designed tidal turbine and will be adopted with an acceptable confidence level in the estimation of the hydrodynamic performance of the new machine configurations 4 3 comparison between 1 d and 3 d modeling a comparison between the developed 1 d model and the current numerical simulations for full length blade and for the single rotor open center turbine is presented in fig 8 the results show a very good agreement in the whole range of tested operating conditions and allow one to conclude that both the 1 d and the cfd approaches furnish reliable results limitations to the adoption of the 1 d approach for the double rotor configuration rely in modeling the flow interactions between the counter rotating rotors these limitations are overcome by adopting a full 3 d cfd approach as will be seen in the next section 5 results and discussion for each machine configuration simulations are carried out for a free stream velocity v 0 3 m s and for different values of the tip speed ratio λ which is changed by modifying the machine rotational speed the results are plotted in fig 9 the results show that the maximum c p for all configurations is achieved for λ 2 2 8 for the full length blade configuration the range of high performance c p 0 3 is quite extended and the maximum c p is achieved at 2 5 λ 3 for the single rotor open center configuration a slight increase in the power coefficient with respect to the full length blade configuration is obtained at the low tip speed ratios while the machine performance decays more rapidly at the higher λ values the double rotor configuration shows a significant improvement in the c p at lower tip speed ratios and a more rapid decay at higher values the total extracted power p the power coefficient c p and the machine weight power ratio are summarized in table 4 the results are referred to the optimal operating conditions the reference area a ref for c p estimation is the total frontal area of the turbine and the weight power is obtained by considering that the turbine is made of aluminum the results show that the adoption of a single rotor open center rotor allows a slight increase in extracted power and power coefficient when compared to the full length blade machine while the weight power is almost the same considerable advantages are observed for the double rotor configuration which allows the achievement of a higher amount of extracted power and therefore higher efficiency with a reduction in the machine weight per produced kw 5 1 flow field analysis the flow analysis is carried out by evaluating the velocity components in three different sections located at a distance of z d e 0 01 0 1 and at the domain exit downstream the turbine for each machine configuration fig 10 shows the axial velocity component for each configuration reading the figure along the columns a strong reduction in the axial velocity component behind the turbine due to the conversion of the kinetic inflow energy into blade mechanical energy is quite well visible a flow acceleration is observed at a radius larger than r e owing to the upstream flow that moves around the turbine in the wake z d e 6 part of the velocity defect arising at the turbine section is recovered far downstream owing to the turbulent mixing in the shear layer between the free stream and wake which transfers momentum back into the wake for the open center configurations a flow acceleration is also observed for a radius lower than r i owing to the inner free stream velocity where the velocity increases up to 3 5 m s however owing to the mixing between the free stream and the wake in the inner flow region the energy is recovered in the annular wake behind the blades and the velocity is slowed down in the open center region moving along the rows of the same figure in the section located at z d e 0 01 the full length blade configuration shows a larger area interested by the axial velocity reduction than the case of the open center single rotor configuration in the latter case in fact the open center permits the undisturbed free stream to flow through it this causes the different momentum values acting on each blade about 66 nm for the full length blade configuration and about 34 nm for the open center configuration the extracted power in the single rotor open center configuration is however higher owing to the increased number of blades when the double rotor configuration is analyzed the axial velocity defect is bounded into a narrower region than the single rotor configuration owing to the shorter blades which characterize each single rotor in this case the momentum acting on each blade of the external and internal rotor amounts to 16 nm and 24 nm respectively therefore the momentum is even lower in this case however the number of blades compensates the lower torque and a higher power can be extracted the tangential velocity component arises behind the rotor and transforms part of the flow kinetic energy into rotational motion representing therefore a source of energy losses for the machine fig 11 shows the tangential velocity contours in the transverse sections located at z d e 0 01 0 1 and at the domain outlet in the downstream direction seen from the back in order to better put in evidence the velocity gradient behind the blades the first row of fig 11 shows that the tangential velocity component for the full length blade configuration is maximum in proximity of the blade root in the single rotor open center case the tangential velocity components reduce their intensity even though the blades are physically closer and therefore the tangential velocity profile becomes more uniform over the swept area of the turbine however in the latter case the tangential components arising at the inner blade radius which have the highest intensity are overcome in the double rotor configuration the tangential components are relevant at the tip of the internal rotor however the wake flow interested by the highest intensity of the tangential velocity component is bounded in a narrower area if compared to the previous configurations their intensity in fact is considerably reduced in the radial direction owing to the external counter rotating rotor which recovers this lost power a region where the tangential component is null is observed at the interface between the rotors for the open center configurations the contrasting effects due to the tangential velocity gradients and the increased number on blades do not allow to draw a conclusion on the effects of the tangential velocity component on the machine efficiency a quantitative analysis on the wake energy is therefore needed to estimate these effects finally the radial velocity component is reported in fig 12 behind the rotor z d e 0 01 the tip vortices are well visible for each considered geometry for the double rotor open center configuration vortices occur also at the blade root of the inner rotor with an opposite rotating direction with respect to the external rotor at z d e 0 1 for the full length blade configuration the radial velocity gradients propagate outwards and broaden the wake which slightly contributes to increase the axial velocity defect occurring at the turbine blades fig 10 however far downstream the radial velocity component reduces and becomes zero after a distance corresponding to 2 rotor diameters and part of the axial velocity deficit is recovered far downstream the turbine in accordance with fig 10 column 1 in the single rotor open center configuration the mixing between the free stream and wake occurs both in the outer free stream and in the inner one in the outer free stream the radial velocity gradients occur outwards on the contrary in the open center the radial velocity direction is inward owing to a suction effect caused by the inner free stream overall a reduction in the wake opening at the rotor disk is observed this effect is more prominent with the double rotor configuration where in conjunction with the suction effect the external counter rotating rotor similarly as the tangential component contributes to recover the radial components of the inner rotor and to further reduce the flow opening at the disk this is well visible from the streamlines around the three analyzed configurations reported in fig 13 the figures clearly show the opening of the flux downstream the turbine for the full length and the open center configurations the flow opening at the rotor disk tends to reduce passing from the full length blade to the open center configurations and is further reduced for the double rotor configuration where the external rotor tends to recover the power lost in the tangential and radial components of the inner rotor enhancing therefore the efficiency in the power extraction 5 2 energy distribution in the wake the energy distribution in the wake is evaluated in order to quantify the various contributions to the energy losses to this aim a cylindrical control volume which includes the turbine is used for the energy conservation law in the upstream direction the volume extends far enough to have a uniform inflow velocity while downstream the cylinder section is located at a distance of z d e 0 1 the flux of the inflow kinetic energy is computed as 24 e k i n i n 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 the fluxes of energy at the outflow due the axial radial and tangential velocity components are computed as 25 e k i n o u t 1 2 ρ a v 3 where v is the axial radial or tangential velocity component the fluxes associated with the turbulence losses are given by 26 e t u r b o u t 1 2 ρ a v v 2 where v are the standard deviations of the axial tangential and radial components finally the kinetic energy losses through the lateral boundary of the cylinder control volume are computed as 27 p l o s s e k i n i n e k i n o u t e t u r b o u t p being p the mechanical power at the rotor disk fig 14 shows the various contributions for the three machine configurations the figure clearly shows that for the full length blade configuration a percentage of about 38 of the inlet kinetic energy is converted into mechanical power at the rotor about 26 3 is the kinetic energy at the outflow section the major amount of which is retained by the axial velocity component while the percentages lost in radial and tangential components amount to 1 8 and 0 9 respectively turbulence losses are negligible and the viscous and kinetic energy displaced outside the rotor disc through the lateral boundary eq 26 is about 36 and represents therefore the major source of power losses for the single rotor open center configuration the amount of energy lost as outflow kinetic energy increases from 0 9 up to 1 9 for the tangential component and reduces from 1 8 to 0 3 for the radial one this demonstrates that passing from the full length to the open center configuration the energy losses arising from the tangential components increase on the contrary a reduction in energy losses due to the radial component is observed also in this case the major contribution to overall energy losses is due to the flow displaced out from the rotor disk which is however reduced from 36 to 20 if compared to the previous case this energy is partly recovered as mechanical power and part is retained by the axial velocity component finally for the double rotor configuration the kinetic energy lost outside the lateral boundary further reduces 12 this is due to the combined effect of the suction free stream in the open center and to the external rotor which tends to recover the power lost in the tangential and radial components of the inner rotor increasing the extracted power and the percentage of energy retained by the axial velocity component 6 conclusions the flow field in the wake of a new tidal turbine prototype characterized by an open center and its performance in terms of extracted power and power coefficient has been investigated by means of a cfd approach a comparison with a conventional full length configuration has been performed the study has demonstrated that in the conventional wind like turbine the power extracted at the rotor disk amounts to about 38 of the inlet kinetic energy the major source of energy losses is due to the flow displaced outside the rotor disc 36 while the energy losses due to the axial velocity retained by the flow just downstream the disc and the losses due to the crossflow components in the same region amount to 24 and 2 6 of the inlet kinetic energy respectively the single rotor open center configuration allows the achievement of a slightly higher efficiency in the process of extracting power from the flow kinetic energy when compared to the conventional tidal turbine configuration the amount of energy displaced outside the disk is considerably reduced 20 and is compensated by an increase in the axial energy retained by the flow through the open center in this configuration a lower extracted power per blade due to the shorter blades can be overcome by increasing the number of blades therefore in the open center configuration the turbine material is distributed in a more efficient manner by compensating the blade length with increasing the blade number and by eliminating blade material from the most inefficient zone and redistributing it into a more efficient working zone in this case the weight power ratio remains almost constant the double rotor configuration represents the most feasible solution as it allows the achievement of overall performance improvements the extracted power increases of about 15 in comparison to the single rotor and also the weight per unit extracted power is reduced of about 20 the increase in the extracted power can be ascribed to the combined suction effect of the open center and to the external counter rotating rotor which recovers the kinetic energy displaced outside the internal rotor disk in fact this component of energy losses is further reduced to about 12 5 however this advantage is only partly recovered as mechanical power 5 while the remaining part increases

21055,tidal turbines represent a new frontier for extracting energy from a huge potential of renewable source such as the tides despite the technology being mature enough new solutions aimed at improving the machines efficiency with reduced environmental impact and installation costs are currently under investigation a novel tidal turbine characterized by being self balanced and not requiring structures and foundations was recently proposed the machine geometry presents an open center which affects the flow field and improves the machine performance in terms of extracted power and power coefficient at the best of authors knowledge despite being open center turbines produced and installed an evaluation of the fluid dynamics effects of the open center on machine performance is still missing the main objective of the present work is to fill this gap and to contribute to have a deeper insight in the flow field in the wake region and to investigate its effects on machine performance the analysis is carried out by means of a cfd tool for three different machine geometries the open center machine which is modeled in single rotor and double rotors configurations and the traditional wind like machine a comparison with literature experimental data is also included for validation purpose for each analyzed case the flow analysis is carried out for the optimal tip speed ratio a free stream velocity of 3 m s is selected for simulations and a scaled model of the turbine having the diameter of about 1m is considered the results show that the open center configurations allow the achievement of higher performance in terms of power coefficient and extracted power in comparison to the traditional wind like turbines in particular for the new double rotor prototype the estimated cp value is about 0 43 with improvements of about 15 with respect to traditional configurations moreover the corresponding increase in the extracted power which for 1m diameter prototype increases from 5 2 kw to 6 kw is achieved with a lighter machine the weight power ratio in fact reduces from about 2 kg kw for the standard machine configuration to 1 6 kg kw for the new double rotor prototype the improvements in machine performance are related to the fluid dynamics characteristics of the central opening this in fact causes a suction effect which contributes to reduce the energy losses due to radial and tangential kinetic energy displaced out from the rotor disk that for a standard machine amount to about 36 of the inlet kinetic energy only part of these energy losses is recovered as mechanical power to the turbine while the remaining part increases the flow kinetic energy lost in the open center region the amount of energy recovered as mechanical power at the turbine increases considerably in the double rotor configuration where besides the suction effect of the open center the external counter rotating rotor gives the major contribution to the recovery of the kinetic energy lost in tangential and radial components of the inner rotor which is then reduced down to 12 5 keywords tidal current marine turbine power coefficient cfd analysis double rotor bem

momentum cfd computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction owing to the increasing concerns about environmental issues and to the even more severe regulations on co2 emissions deriving from the use of fossil fuels the production of electricity from renewable sources is widely spreading in particular research in the exploitation of energy from marine currents has undergone considerable improvements in the last decade due to two main factors the first one is the great potential to generate large amounts of electricity from tidal energy technologies it is estimated that the exploitable marine current power with the available technology is about 75 gw in the world and about 11 gw in europe boye et al 2013 the second one is the high predictability of the tidal current resource over other renewable energy sources marine tidal currents were predicted with 98 accuracy for decades benelghali et al 2007 the technology for extracting energy from tidal currents is constantly evolving and includes both turbine systems and non turbine systems oscillating hydrofoils flutter vanes sails with reference to turbine systems satisfactory levels have been reached in terms of performance and reliability and a number of horizontal axis large scale turbines have been developed and industrialized zhou et al 2017 although many designs of tidal energy converters have been proposed over the years the configuration which has been more attractive for the industry and has seen the furthest advancement in terms of commercial scale deployment is the traditional 3 bladed horizontal axis design similar to its wind turbine counterpart allsop et al 2017 typical commercial turbines have variable pitch blades a diameter of 15 25 m and rated power 1 2 mw one of the most recent projects which has seen the installation of three turbines of a 6 mw array in the pentland firth scotland is the meygen project phase 1a meygen 2016 meygen 2016 in order to make this technology even more viable and competitive new approaches for enhancing the hydrodynamic performance are currently under study in order to improve the working efficiency of tidal stream turbines blades optimization is often required after the preliminary design and aims at increasing lift and reducing drag forces which advantageously affect torque and thrust on the turbine optimization method is mostly based on genetic algorithm which is basically aimed at determining the distribution of blade chord length twist angle and thickness along the radius sale et al 2009 goundar and ahmed 2013 another way to improve hydrodynamic efficiency relies in the adoption of contra rotating rotors which allow the achievement of enhanced performance than single rotor clarke et al 2007 huang et al 2016 with improvements in the maximum power coefficient up to 13 this is mainly due to the lack of swirling velocity component in the downstream of the rear rotor moreover increased power output is obtained owing to the presence of two rotors and advantages in terms of structural design and mooring arrangements are achieved owing to the near zero reaction torque on the supporting structure turbines with diffusers and ducts have been also studied and developed to improve turbine efficiency thorpe 2005 jones and chao 2009 gaden and bibeau 2010 the duct in fact increases the flow velocity at the throat where the rotor is placed increasing therefore the energy that can be captured by turbine blades of a given diameter this keeps the size of the complex moving components to a minimum thus reducing manufacturing as well as operating and maintenance costs finally new non conventional geometries have been developed and industrialized dcns openhydro have installed a pair of 500 kw rated capacity turbines as a demonstration array in paimpol bréhat northern france in collaboration with edf openhydro ltd cape sharp the turbine design which is characterized by high solidity blades is ducted and presents an open center this contributes to further improve the machine performance providing a suction effect to accelerate the flow through the turbine and increasing the power take off while maintaining a high structural strength technological evolution cannot disregard of the improvements in numerical modeling and experimental tests which are fundamental in order to gain insight into the turbines hydrodynamic assessment the simpler approaches proposed over the years for the design of a turbine which determine the overall performance similarly as for wind turbines are mainly based on the blade element momentum theory bemt burton et al 2000 according to this theory the rotor is modeled as a set of isolated two dimensional blade elements to which the hydrodynamics theory can be applied individually the integration of the elemental forces over the blade length determines the thrust and torque applied to the rotor moreover by means of simple correlations the bemt permits the design of the blades in terms of chord variation and pitch angle along the radius despite this method being based on quite simplified assumptions its great advantage consists in the achievement of a satisfactory level of accuracy in spite of low computational requirements which make this approach particularly suitable for engineering assessments especially during the design stage for this reason as for wind turbines this approach is equally adopted for tidal turbines the design criteria however taking into account the different working fluids and the environment winter 2011 the good predictive capabilities of this approach were demonstrated in several works where however 3 bladed turbines are modeled among the most recent literature coiro et al 2006 experimentally validated numerical codes based on standard glauert s blade element theory modified following prandtl s theory and the higher order correction method to predict the performance of a horizontal axis hydro turbine batten et al 2007 and bahaj et al 2008 developed simulation tools based on blade element momentum theory which were validated with model scale experiments on a model 800 mm diameter turbine in a cavitation tunnel and a towing tank the results obtained in terms of shaft power and thrust generated by the turbine for a series of blade pitch settings and speeds demonstrated that this theory provides a satisfactory representation of the experimental turbine performance characteristics availability of such models for different geometries in particular for high solidity and open center models is however missing moreover limitations in the adoption of bem theory rely in the unpredictability of flow field variables and wake characteristics more complex high fidelity models used to perform detailed hydrodynamic assessment and to determine wake formation are based on the use of the computational fluid dynamics cfd this technique is widely spreading thanks to the development of numerical methods and to the increasing availability of supercomputing resources cfd applications have been recently abundant and studies were carried out for the analysis of three dimensional turbines mason jones et al 2008 kinnas and xu 2009 and for the wake effects harrison et al 2009 lee et al 2010 the analysis of the wake behind a turbine and in particular of the near wake is required to investigate the interaction effects between flow and a turbine which are useful to further understand the power extracting mechanism from a tidal turbine several computational approaches have been proposed in order to investigate the near wake and these can be classified into a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models coupled to multiple reference frame mrf or to sliding mesh techniques li and çalişal 2010 liu et al 2016 b the so called actuator models harrison et al 2010 c hybrid models like rans equations coupled to blade element methodology rans bem belloni et al 2017 turnock et al 2011 both the mrf and sliding mesh techniques attempt to simulate the actual geometry of the turbine rotor so that they can represent the three dimensional 3d wake structure more realistically than other methods can do moreover they catch the helical vortex of the wake induced by the blade tips better the drawback relies in the computational effort which is expensive when compared to other techniques as very fine grid around the turbine rotor to capture flow details is needed a less computationally expensive approach is the actuator disc models adm according to which the real geometry is replaced by the set of reaction forces that it produces the approach was proposed and validated through experimental tests in bahaj et al 2007 myers and bahaj 2009 who demonstrated however that the obtained downstream results of the near field wake within 7 diameters distance were not realistic finally the rans bem method has been proved to be powerful in predicting output power of the turbine and flow characteristics of the wake allsop et al 2017 belloni et al 2017 however this method could not represent the blade tip vortices of a rotating rotor and thereby a fast recovery of the velocity in the downstream was obtained batten et al 2013 a novel turbine prototype was recently proposed by the authors in barbarelli et al 2014 2018 lo zupone et al 2017 where detailed geometry description and working principle are given the turbine is characterized by being a high solidity open center horizontal axis tidal turbine which similarly to openhydro ltd cape sharp is conceived with an open center in order to take advantage of an expected suction effect which accelerates the flow through the turbine moreover by eliminating the central area of the blade further advantages are expected owing to weight and drag which are held to a minimum the machine is also characterized by having two counter rotating rotors which as demonstrated in clarke et al 2007 huang et al 2016 can help improving hydrodynamic efficiency by reducing the swirling velocity component in the downstream of the rotors in this paper the assessment of the hydrodynamic performance of the novel prototype is presented as a first aspect a methodology of the blade design specifically developed for open center configurations is proposed the approach is based on bemt theory and a generalized iterative procedure based on 1 d approach is developed for evaluating the power coefficient with varying the tip speed ratio the work is completed by a full 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model coupled with multiple reference frame mrf in particular a near wake analysis which aims at evaluating the effects related to the presence of an open center in the design of non conventional tidal current turbines in comparison to the traditional wind like turbine configurations is presented despite being open center machines industrialized and installed detailed flow field analyses which demonstrate the beneficial effects of the open center on machine performance are very limited moreover by means of the near wake analysis the effects of the counter rotating rotors on the reduction of swirling velocity component are analyzed finally the energy distribution in the wake is evaluated in order to quantify the various contributions to the energy losses which help having further insight into interaction effects between flow and a turbine and are useful to further understand the power extracting mechanism from a tidal turbine the cfd numerical model is validated by means of literature experimental data morandi et al 2016 following a rigorous verification and validation procedure stern et al 2006 the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the machine geometry section 3 includes the criteria based on bemt theory for the blades design of the various machine configurations and presents the iterative procedure developed in matlab environment for assessing the machine performance by varying the tip speed ratio section 4 summarizes the cfd modeling criteria and model validation finally section 5 presents the achieved results for the various machine configurations 2 geometry the turbine used as a reference in the present work is a new open center prototype whose working principle is presented in barbarelli et al barbarelli et al 2014 2018 lo zupone et al 2017 it is designed with the aim to exploit tidal currents near to the coast by eliminating structures supports and foundations and by keeping the machine in equilibrium in the water in a correct position by a simple rope which is subject to a tensile stress in order to achieve this goal the turbine is designed with a proper geometrical configuration fig 1 in particular a central deflector maintains the machine always facing the flow and a vertical stabilizer connected to the stator by a vertical bar keeps the machine at the expected depth a built in permanent magnets generator is arranged into the stator the machine working principle is quite similar to a kite fig 1 b c the weight w reduced by the archimedes thrust t a and the rate of change of the axial momentum t are balanced by the lift l produced by the tidal current on the central deflector installed in the middle of the blade discs this force in turn tends to push off the turbine however the simultaneous action of the forces w t a t and of the reaction r of the rope allows the turbine to reach the equilibrium in a position related to the coast which remains unchanged with varying the flow velocity in this work a scale model having an external diameter of 1 12m is considered however real scale systems will consider for rotors between 10 12 m which are capable of delivering hundreds of kw the machine is designed in single and double rotor configurations the inner diameter is constrained by the internal deflector dimension in order to evaluate the fluid dynamic effects of the open center on the machine performance a comparison with a traditional full length blade machine obtained by adopting the design criteria as for the open center configuration is also included it is worth to observe that in this case a maximum of 6 blades can be considered for the fixed external rotor diameter in order to avoid blades interference the main geometric parameters for the investigated configurations are summarized in table 1 and their schematics are reported in fig 2 3 methodology in this section the blades design procedure widely discussed in barbarelli et al 2014 is briefly described for the sake of clarity the approach is based on the adoption of optimal design rules developed for wind turbines and revised for applications to the marine turbines in the present paper as a further step in machine characterization a 1 d model is developed in matlab environment for evaluating the machine performance under off design conditions by estimating the power coefficient c p for different values of the tip speed ratio λ 3 1 blades design the blades are designed through the relations of optimal blade design 2 4 which allow to obtain the radial dimensions of

rotor radius r the choice of the parameters λ and b in eq 2 is carried out in order to maximize the power coefficient c p and is the key issue for optimizing the machine performance an implicit correlation between λ and b is given by the blade solidity 5 σ b l a d e a r e a b l a d e d i s c a r e a b c 2 π r m where c is the blade chord and r m is the mean radius fig 4 shows the solidity as a function of the tipspeed ratio for blades designed for an airfoil naca 4412 minniti 2010 the figure suggests that slow turbines which perform better for low flow velocities must be designed with a higher solidity than the fast ones which on the contrary operate better in those sites where the flow velocities are higher in the present case the site where the turbine is thought to be placed is characterized by a low stream velocity 3 m s therefore a low tip speed ratio must be chosen which implies a high blade solidity moreover the proper choice of λ is also carried out by taking account a set of hydrodynamic structural geometric and economic constraints once these parameters are selected the maximum c p is obtained with the following equation derived from the vortex cylinder theory combined with prandtl theory 6 c p 16 27 exp 0 3538 λ 1 2946 c d c l λ the blade lift coefficient c l can be obtained by means of the on line available tool javafoil https www mh aerotools by defining the blade aspect ratio ar which characterizes the squatness of the blade the attack angle α and the reynolds number the aspect ratio is defined as 7 a r b l a d e l e n g h t c h o r d l b c r where the blade length is obtained as the half difference between the inner and the outer rotor diameter d i and d e respectively the average chord c r at the mean rotor radius r m for defining the aspect

stream velocity of 3 m s once obtained the c l value it is included in eq 1 and by applying equations 1 to 4 with varying the rotor radius r the blade design is achieved for the full length blade configuration fig 2 invested by a tidal current having a velocity of 3 m s the optimal tip speed ratio was found to be about 2 5 with a blade solidity σ 0 3 and b 6 the optimal c p value obtained for the aforementioned operating conditions through eq 6 is cp 0 38 3 2 1 d model for evaluating machine cp as a function of the tip speed ratio a 1 d model for the preliminary evaluation of the rotor performance in terms of power coefficient c p with varying the tip speed ratio λ is proposed the model inputs are blade geometry expressed in terms of chord c and pitch angle variation β along the radius and lift and drag coefficients as a function of the incidence angle α obtained by the software javafoils https www mh aerotools the following equations are implemented in the model the power

area of the turbine or alternatively by considering the rotor area which for the open center configuration can be calculated as 9 a r o t o r π r e 2 r i 2 being r e and r i the outer and inner rotor radii respectively it is clear that normalizing power on a rotor leads to much higher power coefficients than by considering a disc with reference to fig 3 the relative flow velocity w and inflow

to the external one r e by defining the turbine power as p qω the power coefficient c p can be calculated according to eq 8 the variation of the inflow angle ϕ and the incidence angle α along the radius are not known a priori therefore at the first iteration these parameter are set equal to zero and equations from 12 to 15 are solved calculating therefore a and a with these values eq 11 is solved for estimating the inflow angle ϕ this procedure is run iteratively until convergence is reached the results of the numerical 1 d model are reported in fig 5 both for the conventional case of the full length blades and for the single rotor open center configuration the figure shows that for both configurations the maximum power coefficient is achieved for λ 2 5 2 8 which is in accordance with the value selected for optimal blades design for the single rotor open center configuration a higher maximum c p value is achieved the proposed approach does not apply to the double rotor configuration where the interaction effects among the two counter rotating rotors are not modeled in such a case a cfd analysis is more suitable to be applied for the analysis of the machine c p with varying the tip speed ratio 4 cfd modeling numerical simulations are carried out with the commercial code fluent the use of a rotating reference frame allows the problem to be treated as steady hence time discretization is not needed in particular the multiple reference frame mrf approach is adopted to model the rotating components the use of this approach requires the subdivision of the computational domain into stationary and rotating zones which are separated by interfaces where appropriate transformations of the velocity vector and velocity gradients are performed to determine fluxes of mass momentum and other scalars the equations are discretized in space by employing a cell centered finite volume technique a pressure based algorithm is used to sequentially solve the discretized equations and the piso pressure velocity coupling scheme is adopted to enforce mass conservation resulting in a pressure correction equation second order upwind schemes and second order central differences are employed for discretization of convective and diffusion terms respectively turbulence is modeled by means of the two equations κ ε realizable model which in previous studies o doherty et al 2009 was demonstrated to achieve high level of accuracy in the simulations of the rotating flows with particular regard to horizontal axis tidal turbines 4 1 grids and boundary conditions for the considered machine configurations the corresponding computational domains are designed the whole computational domain is composed of two blocks which include the rotor subdomain and the background block the computational domain has a length of 9d and a radius of 3d where d represents the turbine diameter at the inlet a constant value of water velocity is applied and a no slip condition is enforced on the turbine blade surfaces the use of a periodic boundary condition on the domain sides allows the reduction of the computational effort unstructured mesh with tetrahedral cells is used in order to overcome the difficulty of generating the mesh around complex geometries grid refinement occurs in proximity of the blade surface near the leading edge trailing edge and blade tip fig 6 in particular shows the computational domains and the boundary conditions used in the current simulations for the open center configuration 4 2 cfd model validation a verification and validation v v analysis is carried out in order to quantify errors and uncertainties in cfd simulations stern et al 2006 the study is proposed for the full length blade configuration by using the power coefficient c p as a key parameter to evaluate the level of accuracy of the proposed numerical approach verification provides an estimation of the numerical errors given by iterative errors and grid and time step spacing errors in the present study iterative errors are negligible in comparison to the grid ones therefore grid uncertainty gives the main contribution to numerical uncertainty u sn moreover the simulations are carried out under steady conditions and no time step errors are considered hence only a grid dependence study is necessary the study is carried out on three meshes having a refinement ratio r 2 the grids dimensions for g 1 g 2 and g 3 are 1 0 0 71 and 0 5 m respectively the convergence ratio is defined as 17 r s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 being s 1 s 2 and s 3 the solutions corresponding to the fine medium and coarse grid respectively when monotonic convergence is achieved 0 r 1 the generalized richardson extrapolation is used for estimation of numerical error according to the following definition 18 δ r e ε 21 r p 1 where ε 21 s 2 s 1 r is the refinement ratio and p is the estimated order of accuracy calculated as 19 p l n s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 l n r when solutions are in the asymptotic range then p p th where p th is the theoretical order of accuracy of the numerical method in many cases especially for coarse grids and industrial applications solutions are far from the asymptotic range such that p is greater or smaller than p th stern et al 2006 use the correction factor c g as a metric for defining the distance of solutions from the asymptotic range 20 c g r p 1 r p t h 1 in this case where c g is sufficiently greater than 1 the grid uncertainty u g is estimated as 21 u g c g δ r e 1 c g δ r e the results of the verification study for the full length blade configuration are summarized in table 2 which shows that monotonic convergence is reached by increasing the mesh quality r 1 that the order of accuracy p eq 19 is higher than the theoretical order of accuracy of the numerical method p th 2 and the correction factor c g eq 20 which is higher than 1 indicates that the solution is far from the asymptotic range therefore the uncertainty due to grid spacing can be calculated according to eq 21 this uncertainty u g is about 0 69 of the finest grid solution and is acceptably small u sn therefore is due to grid spacing only and can be further reduced by increasing the grid refinement validation allows the estimation of modeling errors by a comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data the validation uncertainty u v is computed as 22 u v 2 u s n 2 u d 2 where u d is the uncertainty of the experimental data the comparison error e defined as the difference between the experimental data d and the simulation results s gives a metrics of the solution accuracy if e is within the u v interval the solution is validated at the u v level otherwise the sign and magnitude of e are used to estimate the error deriving from the modeling assumptions and improvements can be made on the model to date a machine prototype has not yet been realized and no experimental data are available therefore for validation purpose a tidal turbine having similar geometrical properties as the full length blade configuration and operating under the same conditions has been considered as a benchmark and the power coefficient c p was adopted for comparison the tested machine is a scale model of the sabella d10 tidal turbine having an external diameter of 402 mm and a hub diameter of 87 4 mm morandi et al 2016 a high degree of geometrical similarity is observed for both geometries in fact both machines have 6 blades and for both cases the blade length amounts to 78 of the external diameter however the machines differ in two main aspects the diameter and the blade section profile which in the proposed case is a naca 4412 and in morandi et al 2016 has an elliptical section as for diameter no significant effects on power coefficient are expected in fact from literature mason jones et al 2012 for two geometrically similar machines the power coefficient is a function of the reynolds number and of the tip speed ratio 23 c p f r e t s r therefore if the geometries are completely similar and if the machines operate with the same reynolds number and the same tip speed ratio the same c p is expected for both diameters moreover in high reynolds number flows i e re of the order 106 it is not unusual for the independent variable group to become independent of reynolds number which simplifies significantly the scaling process the operating conditions adopted for the proposed prototype v 0 3 0 m s λ 1 5 4 5 are included in the range of operating conditions selected for the scale model where the performance analysis was carried out for a range of the tip speed ratio from 0 0 to 4 8 and for inflow velocities ranging from 2 26 to 3 00 m s therefore reynolds number falls in the range 1 3 106 both for the prototype and for scale model this indicates that the effects of a different diameter on the c p can be neglected on the contrary the element which can significantly affect the c p is the blade section profile therefore in the validation process some differences in power coefficient between both geometries are expected it is worth pointing out that the study is carried out with the main purpose to estimate how far from realistic ranges the numerical c p values are in order to evaluate their reliability to this aim a comparison between the experimental data and the current results for an inflow velocity of 3 m s is plotted in fig 7 it can be observed that the trend of cfd simulations shows a quite similar behavior as experimental data especially in the range of high turbine performance c p 0 3 on the contrary larger differences occur at low and high tip speed values owing to the different blade section which in the experiments is a symmetric elliptic section while in the simulations it is a naca 4412 airfoil in particular at low tip speed values a rotor stall condition is more favorable for the elliptic blade section at high tip speed ratios the effects of a lower blade efficiency of the elliptic blade profile are more severe the achieved results are quite encouraging to proceed with validation the verification and validation study is carried out for the operating condition λ 2 5 the results of the validation procedure are reported in table 3 which shows that the major contribution to validation uncertainty u v eq 22 relies in the experimental data while the contribution due to numerical simulations is negligible the comparison error e is lower than the validation uncertainty which indicates that the numerical solution is validated at the u v level in this case it is not possible to discriminate between numerical and modeling contributions however an uncertainty level of about 5 6 for the current cfd simulations can be considered acceptable for the complexity of the involved flow physics and the proposed cfd model will be adopted with a good level of confidence for the open center machine configurations in conclusion the developed cfd model can be considered as a valid tool for predicting the performance of the newly designed tidal turbine and will be adopted with an acceptable confidence level in the estimation of the hydrodynamic performance of the new machine configurations 4 3 comparison between 1 d and 3 d modeling a comparison between the developed 1 d model and the current numerical simulations for full length blade and for the single rotor open center turbine is presented in fig 8 the results show a very good agreement in the whole range of tested operating conditions and allow one to conclude that both the 1 d and the cfd approaches furnish reliable results limitations to the adoption of the 1 d approach for the double rotor configuration rely in modeling the flow interactions between the counter rotating rotors these limitations are overcome by adopting a full 3 d cfd approach as will be seen in the next section 5 results and discussion for each machine configuration simulations are carried out for a free stream velocity v 0 3 m s and for different values of the tip speed ratio λ which is changed by modifying the machine rotational speed the results are plotted in fig 9 the results show that the maximum c p for all configurations is achieved for λ 2 2 8 for the full length blade configuration the range of high performance c p 0 3 is quite extended and the maximum c p is achieved at 2 5 λ 3 for the single rotor open center configuration a slight increase in the power coefficient with respect to the full length blade configuration is obtained at the low tip speed ratios while the machine performance decays more rapidly at the higher λ values the double rotor configuration shows a significant improvement in the c p at lower tip speed ratios and a more rapid decay at higher values the total extracted power p the power coefficient c p and the machine weight power ratio are summarized in table 4 the results are referred to the optimal operating conditions the reference area a ref for c p estimation is the total frontal area of the turbine and the weight power is obtained by considering that the turbine is made of aluminum the results show that the adoption of a single rotor open center rotor allows a slight increase in extracted power and power coefficient when compared to the full length blade machine while the weight power is almost the same considerable advantages are observed for the double rotor configuration which allows the achievement of a higher amount of extracted power and therefore higher efficiency with a reduction in the machine weight per produced kw 5 1 flow field analysis the flow analysis is carried out by evaluating the velocity components in three different sections located at a distance of z d e 0 01 0 1 and at the domain exit downstream the turbine for each machine configuration fig 10 shows the axial velocity component for each configuration reading the figure along the columns a strong reduction in the axial velocity component behind the turbine due to the conversion of the kinetic inflow energy into blade mechanical energy is quite well visible a flow acceleration is observed at a radius larger than r e owing to the upstream flow that moves around the turbine in the wake z d e 6 part of the velocity defect arising at the turbine section is recovered far downstream owing to the turbulent mixing in the shear layer between the free stream and wake which transfers momentum back into the wake for the open center configurations a flow acceleration is also observed for a radius lower than r i owing to the inner free stream velocity where the velocity increases up to 3 5 m s however owing to the mixing between the free stream and the wake in the inner flow region the energy is recovered in the annular wake behind the blades and the velocity is slowed down in the open center region moving along the rows of the same figure in the section located at z d e 0 01 the full length blade configuration shows a larger area interested by the axial velocity reduction than the case of the open center single rotor configuration in the latter case in fact the open center permits the undisturbed free stream to flow through it this causes the different momentum values acting on each blade about 66 nm for the full length blade configuration and about 34 nm for the open center configuration the extracted power in the single rotor open center configuration is however higher owing to the increased number of blades when the double rotor configuration is analyzed the axial velocity defect is bounded into a narrower region than the single rotor configuration owing to the shorter blades which characterize each single rotor in this case the momentum acting on each blade of the external and internal rotor amounts to 16 nm and 24 nm respectively therefore the momentum is even lower in this case however the number of blades compensates the lower torque and a higher power can be extracted the tangential velocity component arises behind the rotor and transforms part of the flow kinetic energy into rotational motion representing therefore a source of energy losses for the machine fig 11 shows the tangential velocity contours in the transverse sections located at z d e 0 01 0 1 and at the domain outlet in the downstream direction seen from the back in order to better put in evidence the velocity gradient behind the blades the first row of fig 11 shows that the tangential velocity component for the full length blade configuration is maximum in proximity of the blade root in the single rotor open center case the tangential velocity components reduce their intensity even though the blades are physically closer and therefore the tangential velocity profile becomes more uniform over the swept area of the turbine however in the latter case the tangential components arising at the inner blade radius which have the highest intensity are overcome in the double rotor configuration the tangential components are relevant at the tip of the internal rotor however the wake flow interested by the highest intensity of the tangential velocity component is bounded in a narrower area if compared to the previous configurations their intensity in fact is considerably reduced in the radial direction owing to the external counter rotating rotor which recovers this lost power a region where the tangential component is null is observed at the interface between the rotors for the open center configurations the contrasting effects due to the tangential velocity gradients and the increased number on blades do not allow to draw a conclusion on the effects of the tangential velocity component on the machine efficiency a quantitative analysis on the wake energy is therefore needed to estimate these effects finally the radial velocity component is reported in fig 12 behind the rotor z d e 0 01 the tip vortices are well visible for each considered geometry for the double rotor open center configuration vortices occur also at the blade root of the inner rotor with an opposite rotating direction with respect to the external rotor at z d e 0 1 for the full length blade configuration the radial velocity gradients propagate outwards and broaden the wake which slightly contributes to increase the axial velocity defect occurring at the turbine blades fig 10 however far downstream the radial velocity component reduces and becomes zero after a distance corresponding to 2 rotor diameters and part of the axial velocity deficit is recovered far downstream the turbine in accordance with fig 10 column 1 in the single rotor open center configuration the mixing between the free stream and wake occurs both in the outer free stream and in the inner one in the outer free stream the radial velocity gradients occur outwards on the contrary in the open center the radial velocity direction is inward owing to a suction effect caused by the inner free stream overall a reduction in the wake opening at the rotor disk is observed this effect is more prominent with the double rotor configuration where in conjunction with the suction effect the external counter rotating rotor similarly as the tangential component contributes to recover the radial components of the inner rotor and to further reduce the flow opening at the disk this is well visible from the streamlines around the three analyzed configurations reported in fig 13 the figures clearly show the opening of the flux downstream the turbine for the full length and the open center configurations the flow opening at the rotor disk tends to reduce passing from the full length blade to the open center configurations and is further reduced for the double rotor configuration where the external rotor tends to recover the power lost in the tangential and radial components of the inner rotor enhancing therefore the efficiency in the power extraction 5 2 energy distribution in the wake the energy distribution in the wake is evaluated in order to quantify the various contributions to the energy losses to this aim a cylindrical control volume which includes the turbine is used for the energy conservation law in the upstream direction the volume extends far enough to have a uniform inflow velocity while downstream the cylinder section is located at a distance of z d e 0 1 the flux of the inflow kinetic energy is computed as 24 e k i n i n 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 the fluxes of energy at the outflow due the axial radial and tangential velocity components are computed as 25 e k i n o u t 1 2 ρ a v 3 where v is the axial radial or tangential velocity component the fluxes associated with the turbulence losses are given by 26 e t u r b o u t 1 2 ρ a v v 2 where v are the standard deviations of the axial tangential and radial components finally the kinetic energy losses through the lateral boundary of the cylinder control volume are computed as 27 p l o s s e k i n i n e k i n o u t e t u r b o u t p being p the mechanical power at the rotor disk fig 14 shows the various contributions for the three machine configurations the figure clearly shows that for the full length blade configuration a percentage of about 38 of the inlet kinetic energy is converted into mechanical power at the rotor about 26 3 is the kinetic energy at the outflow section the major amount of which is retained by the axial velocity component while the percentages lost in radial and tangential components amount to 1 8 and 0 9 respectively turbulence losses are negligible and the viscous and kinetic energy displaced outside the rotor disc through the lateral boundary eq 26 is about 36 and represents therefore the major source of power losses for the single rotor open center configuration the amount of energy lost as outflow kinetic energy increases from 0 9 up to 1 9 for the tangential component and reduces from 1 8 to 0 3 for the radial one this demonstrates that passing from the full length to the open center configuration the energy losses arising from the tangential components increase on the contrary a reduction in energy losses due to the radial component is observed also in this case the major contribution to overall energy losses is due to the flow displaced out from the rotor disk which is however reduced from 36 to 20 if compared to the previous case this energy is partly recovered as mechanical power and part is retained by the axial velocity component finally for the double rotor configuration the kinetic energy lost outside the lateral boundary further reduces 12 this is due to the combined effect of the suction free stream in the open center and to the external rotor which tends to recover the power lost in the tangential and radial components of the inner rotor increasing the extracted power and the percentage of energy retained by the axial velocity component 6 conclusions the flow field in the wake of a new tidal turbine prototype characterized by an open center and its performance in terms of extracted power and power coefficient has been investigated by means of a cfd approach a comparison with a conventional full length configuration has been performed the study has demonstrated that in the conventional wind like turbine the power extracted at the rotor disk amounts to about 38 of the inlet kinetic energy the major source of energy losses is due to the flow displaced outside the rotor disc 36 while the energy losses due to the axial velocity retained by the flow just downstream the disc and the losses due to the crossflow components in the same region amount to 24 and 2 6 of the inlet kinetic energy respectively the single rotor open center configuration allows the achievement of a slightly higher efficiency in the process of extracting power from the flow kinetic energy when compared to the conventional tidal turbine configuration the amount of energy displaced outside the disk is considerably reduced 20 and is compensated by an increase in the axial energy retained by the flow through the open center in this configuration a lower extracted power per blade due to the shorter blades can be overcome by increasing the number of blades therefore in the open center configuration the turbine material is distributed in a more efficient manner by compensating the blade length with increasing the blade number and by eliminating blade material from the most inefficient zone and redistributing it into a more efficient working zone in this case the weight power ratio remains almost constant the double rotor configuration represents the most feasible solution as it allows the achievement of overall performance improvements the extracted power increases of about 15 in comparison to the single rotor and also the weight per unit extracted power is reduced of about 20 the increase in the extracted power can be ascribed to the combined suction effect of the open center and to the external counter rotating rotor which recovers the kinetic energy displaced outside the internal rotor disk in fact this component of energy losses is further reduced to about 12 5 however this advantage is only partly recovered as mechanical power 5 while the remaining part increases

author steady flow around a square cylinder placed near a plane wall boundary is investigated experimentally in the present work covering the range of reynolds number of re 7 34 104 4 12 105 gap ratios of g d 0 3 with two different freestream turbulent intensity i u 1 and 9 the influence of reynolds number gap ratios and turbulent intensity on the hydrodynamic characteristics have been studied systematically two dimensional large eddy simulation les were employed for flow visualizations it is found that the hydrodynamic forces on a square cylinder are independent of re even for the very small gap ratio cases for the influence of the low turbulent intensity i u 1 the hydrodynamic features and vortex shedding are insensitive to the gap effect as g d 1 with the decrease of g d the increase of the base pressure c pb results in the decrease of the drag coefficient c d the amplitude of the periodic fluctuations of the vortex shedding process decreases with the vortex shedding process continuing as g d 0 3 the vortex shedding is observed to be completely suppressed the blockage effect leads to an entrainment of the flow passing through the gap and a low speed recirculation is formed at the plane boundary in the region of x d 7 75 high turbulence tends to increase the base pressure and reduce the drag coefficient of the square cylinder for large gap ratio for g d 0 8 the high turbulence triggers the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder which results in the higher fluctuating drag and lift coefficient the critical gap ratio for the vortex shedding suppression is reduced to g d 0 2 keywords square cylinder hydrodynamic vortex shedding steady flow near wall high reynolds number 1 introduction the flow around bluff bodies has attracted substantial attention for decades due to its engineering applications such as heat exchangers bridge piers and offshore platform and the academic importance on the boundary layer development shear layer instability vortex shedding and so on the circular and square cylinders are the basic representative models for bluff bodies for the circular cylinder many researchers found that with variations of reynolds number r e re ud ν in which u is the freestream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid flow dynamics around a circular cylinder changes dramatically including variations of vortex shedding boundary layer separations and hydrodynamic forces zdravkovich 1997 sumer and fredsøe 1997 fage 1929 for re 5 47 batchelor 1967 observed that a pair of stable symmetric vortices were formed in the wake of the circular cylinder as re further increases to re 194 williamson 1989 and jiang et al 2016 observed the regular two dimensional vortex shedding the cylinder wake starts to show three dimensional instability up to re 300 williamson 1989 the vortex street in the wake starts to transit to turbulent state at re 300 bloor 1964 and five regimes were classified based on the development of the turbulence in the wake and around a circular cylinder including subcritical critical supercritical upper transition and trans critical regimes as summarized by sumer and fredsøe 1997 in the subcritical regime re 3 105 the vortex street in the wake is completely turbulent and the separation of the boundary layer around the circular cylinder remains laminar state the drag coefficient keeps almost constant and strouhal number remains at around 0 21 sumer and fredsøe 1997 as the flow enters the critical regime 3 105 re 3 5 105 the separations of the boundary layer transits from the laminar to turbulent state the drag coefficient experienced an abrupt reduction from 1 2 to 0 3 and a strong non zero lift was also observed yang et al 2018 achenbach and heinecke 1981 with further increasing of r e in the supercritical regime 3 5 105 re 1 5 106 the boundary layer completely transits from laminar to turbulent the drag coefficient remains constant at around 0 3 and the energy of vortices in the cylinder wake reduces significantly schewe 1983 with further increase of r e the boundary layer around a circular cylinder becomes fully turbulent and the flow enters upper transition and trans critical regime different from the flow separation on the surface of a circular cylinder a square cylinder has sharp corners where the boundary layer separation is stationary different mechanism of boundary layer separation leads to different flow structures and hydrodynamic forces between circular and square cylinders norberg 1993 similar to the flow regimes of a circular cylinder r e is the governing factor on the wake flow structures of a square cylinder as re 50 sohankar et al 1998 observed a von kármán vortex street in the wake of the square cylinder with increasing of r e flow separations are observed at the trailing edge of the square cylinder at re 120 and at the leading edges at re 120 yoon et al 2010 robichaux et al 1999 the flow remains at laminar state and the critical reynolds number re c1 150 200 at re c1 the flow starts to transit from two dimensional to three dimensional which is also referred as mode a instability luo et al 2003 2007 saha et al 2003 at this regime the drag coefficient declines with r e exponentially and the strouhal number increases with r e yoon et al 2010 sohankar et al 1999 as r e further increases to re c2 190 250 mode b instability is observed the strouhal number reduces significantly at re c1 re re c2 luo et al 2003 2007 saha et al 2003 robichaux et al 1999 as re re c2 the flow around a square cylinder becomes turbulent many researchers have launched investigations experimentally and numerically bai and alam 2018 cao and tamura 2016 minguez et al 2011 brun et al 2008 sohankar 2006 saha et al 2000 lyn et al 1995 lyn and rodi 1994 the shear layer is at the stable state and rolled up to form the von kármán vortex street in the wake of the cylinder the von kármán vortex street is well captured in the wake region and the kevin helmholtz vortices in the shear layer separated from the leading edge is also observed the strouhal number st is found to be declined at re c2 re 8 103 and kept constant with increasing of r e the drag coefficient increases gradually with increasing of r e at re c2 re 2 104 and keeps almost constant at re 2 104 the fluctuating lift and drag forces in this regime share a very similar feature with the drag coefficient who would increase with increasing of r e at 50 re 2 104 and keeps almost constant at re 2 104 yoon et al 2010 sohankar 2006 sohankar et al 1999 it is noted that the flow regimes based on r e is very sensitive to a number of factors such as freestream turbulence surface roughness aspect ratio blockage ratio etc tamura and miyagi 1999 observed that as the freestream turbulent intensity increased from 0 5 to 12 5 the drag coefficient experienced a reduction while the lift coefficient was independent the effect of a plane boundary on the flow around a square cylinder has also attracted substantial research interests in the past a few decades shi et al 2010b mahir 2009 martinuzzi et al 2003 liou et al 2002 bailey et al 2002a 2002b bosch and rodi 1996 bosch et al 1996 durao et al 1991 for a wall proximity cylinder the gap to diameter ratio g d and wall boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d have obvious influence on the boundary layer separation vortex shedding and hydrodynamic forces hwang and yao 1997 investigated the influence of the boundary layer thickness on the vortex shedding and hydrodynamic forces it was observed that strouhal number and drag coefficients presented a decreasing trend in a thick boundary layer δ d 5 and an increasing trend in a thin boundary layer δ d 0 8 as r e increases from 500 to 1500 bhattacharyya and maiti 2004 found that the critical gap ratio depended on r e in the range of up to re 1400 cheng et al 2007 observed the very similar phenomenon in the range of re 50 200 mahir 2009 successfully captured the transition from mode a to mode b in the wake of a square cylinder with g d 4 and 1 2 at re 175 250 durao et al 1991 reported that the critical gap ratio for suppression of the vortex shedding was at g d 0 35 by examining the predominant peak at the vortex shedding frequency spectrum at re 1 36 104 and δ d 0 8 as g d 0 35 the strouhal number was independent of g d and kept almost constant at 0 133 bosch et al 1996 observed that the critical gap was in a range of g d 0 35 0 5 at re 2 20 104 and δ d 0 13 as g d 0 75 the flow was almost same with that around a free cylinder bailey et al 2002a and bailey et al 2002b however found that the critical gap ratio was at g d 0 4 at re 1 90 104 and δ d 0 47 martinuzzi et al 2003 has systematically investigated the influence of the wall proximity on the vortex shedding of a square cylinder through investigating the mean values and fluctuating pressure distributions and drag and lift forces at re 1 89 104 and δ d 0 8 it was observed that the suppression of the vortex shedding was at g d 0 3 shi et al 2010b described the wake structures of a square cylinder through the particle image velocimetry measurement piv and found the critical gap ratio was at g d 0 4 however as the reynolds number extends to o 10 5 investigations on a square cylinder with a plane boundary is quite rare to the best knowledge of author with perspective to the flow visualizations on a square cylinder at the high reynolds number through the numerical apparatus the investigations are relatively scarce many studies suggest that rans model would have an underprediction of the flow characteristics using various eddy viscosity models bosch and rodi 1996 1998 have observed that the strength and frequency of the vortex shedding is underpredicted through k ε model due to the excessive turbulent kinetic energy at the stagnation region lübcke et al 2001 provided many flow features through explicit algebraic stress model however the results still show very large discrepancies with the experimental data as concluded by franke and rodi 1993 and iaccarino et al 2003 even if the improved rans modeling can capture the correct distributions of the laminar and turbulent region it still tends to underpredict the periodic vortex shedding motion in the wake based on the above knowledge the large eddy simulation les is regarded as the viable approach to capture the turbulent flow around the square cylinder sohankar et al 2000 and voke et al 2012 provided the good agreement with the previous experimental results such as the piv measurement by lyn et al 1995 and rodi 1997 that the les modeling is strongly dependent on resolution or the numerical dissipation of the scheme minguez et al 2011 and mankbadi and georgiadis 2015 reported the detailed flow features on the near wall region of an isolated square cylinder recently whilst the numerical simulations on the square cylinder with a plane wall boundary is quite scare motivated by exploring 1 influence of the gap ratio on the hydrodynamics of the square cylinder at high reynolds number 2 high turbulence intensity effect on the flow characteristic around a square cylinder with a plane wall boundary 3 flow visualizations on the dynamic structures at the near wall region a series of experimental tests through a wind tunnel facility have been carried out in the present work to measure the hydrodynamic forces and pressure distribution acting on a smooth square cylinder in the range of re 7 34 104 4 12 105 ten different gap ratios were launched with two scenario of freestream turbulent intensity being performed two dimensional large eddy simulations around a square cylinder with a plane boundary were employed as the supplementary to visualize the flow and capture the flow structures the rest of the paper is organized as following the details of the experimental setup are presented in sec 2 together with the measurements of the boundary layer profiles and the freestream turbulent intensity are summarized the main results and discussion of the experimental and numerical results are given in sec 3 and conclusions are given in sec 4 the numerical modeling setup and mesh dependency study of the numerical modeling are documented in appendix 2 experimental setup the experimental tests in the present work were conducted in a high speed wind tunnel facility located at dalian university of technology in china the working section of the wind tunnel is 15m 3m 3m in length width height the wind speed can be adjusted continuously from 0 m s to 90 m s the model square cylinder used in the present work was made of smooth transparent acrylic material with d 0 2m and the length of the model is 10d to eliminate the end effect two circular end plates with the diameter of 1m were installed on the two ends of the mode cylinder 35 pressure sensors were installed in the middle section of the model cylinder to measure the pressure distributions on the cylinder surface pressure sensors were connected to a dsm3400 data scanning system by pvc tubes with the diameter of 1 mm the sampling rate was 625hz and recording time was 90s for each case in the present work the whole model square cylinder was supported by two vertical beams in the middle of working section the plane boundary was made of smooth plywood material present work focuses on the smooth square cylinder on the plane boundary a sketch of the model setup is presented in fig 1 the incoming flow direction is set as x axis and the square cylinder is located at x 0 the y axis is along the cylinder axial direction the z axis is perpendicular to the plane boundary and z 0 is at the surface of the plane boundary the upstream length from the edge of plane boundary to the cylinder center is 8d in x direction and 10d in the downstream a pitot tube was installed in the upstream away from the model square cylinder placed outside the boundary layer to monitor the freestream velocity both p and p 0 were measured by the same pressure scanner connected to a pitot tube since all pressure signals were measured by the same pressure scanner the bias errors in c p and c p rms are negligible according to stern et al 1999 s study the total uncertainties of c p and c p rms were largely due to the precision limit of the pressure scanner estimated to be within 3 and 6 respectively the temperature during tests in the working section was around 8 10 c and the kinematic viscosity of air kept at 1 48 10 5 m2 s a total of 6 different freestream velocity in the range of 5 m s to 30 m s corresponding to re 7 34 104 4 12 105 were tested with 2 different freestream turbulent intensity i u covering g d 0 3 in order to provide a good flow quality in the test section turbulence should be kept at reasonably low level this needs a controlling effect to obtain the turbulence reduction in the wind tunnel kulak et al 2012 advised that the combination of honeycomb coarse mesh screens and contraction was the key for the reduction of turbulence intensity applications of the methods would lead to a much diminished turbulence level the high speed wind tunnel facility is equipped with flow stabilization section two turbulence reduction screens are uniformly located in the cross section of the wind tunnel for the screens the diameter of the mesh is 0 4 mm with a cell spacing of 6 cell cm in vertical direction and 7 cell cm in horizontal direction according to the turbulence reduction theories by scheiman and brooks 1981 the total turbulence reduction factor of the wind tunnel gird arrangement is equal approximately to 0 27 and 0 52 for axial and lateral turbulence respectively in order to improve flow quality by reducing lateral turbulence more efficiently the flow manipulator was designed in the stabilization section of the wind tunnel based on the theory of kulkarni et al 2011 the flow manipulator was constructed using pipes arranged in a honeycomb like structure a honeycomb structure is installed in the stabilization section for an additional decrease of turbulence the honeycomb structure is composed of pipe cells with a constant length to diameter ratio which is distributed in the cross section the honeycomb structure can reduce lateral turbulence effectively comparing with the turbulence reduction screens it is understandable that any lateral velocity fluctuation larger than its cell size is effectively absorbed and the smaller turbulence would decay rapidly due to the viscosity the wall thickness can be made as small as possible in order to maximize porosity which would result in minimizing the pressure losses a material of pvc pipe is taken into consideration for the designing of the honeycomb structure due to the economical reason and designing for the smooth wall the combination of the turbulence reduction screen and honeycomb structure can effectively reduce the axial and lateral turbulence respectively which would significantly improve the flow quality in the wind tunnel as indicated by loehrke and nagib 1972 the best turbulence reduction is being obtained when the honeycomb is installed upstream the screens proper combination of screens and honeycomb provided decease of i u to the range of around 1 for half of the maximum wind tunnel speed this corresponds well to many academic quality high speed tunnels found around the world kulak et al 2012 the velocity profiles in the plane boundary layer were measured at the location of x 0 with the model square cylinder removed through a turbulent flow instrument series100 cobra probe the sampling frequency of cobra probe is 2000hz and each location is recorded for 10s for measurement fig 2 presents the mean velocity and its turbulent intensity profiles in the plane wall boundary the turbulent intensity i u at the location of z is defined as i u z u z 2 u in which u z is the fluctuating velocity along the flow direction at the location of z and u is the mean value of freestream velocity the boundary layer thickness δ on the plane wall is determined at the level where its velocity equals 0 99 u schlichting 1979 derived the calculations of the boundary layer thickness δ in the laminar and turbulent state for the laminar boundary layer δ can be calculated as δ 4 91 l 0 r e l 0 0 5 which is based on applying blasius solution to the flow governing equations l 0 is the distance from the point to the plane boundary and re l0 is the reynolds number based on l 0 as re l0 increases to a critical value re l0 cr the boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent happens in the turbulent state δ can be estimated as δ 0 37 l 0 r e l 0 2 sayadi et al 2013 reported that re l0 cr is 3 5 105 for h type transition or 6 5 105 for k type transition in the present study u 0 10 m s is corresponding to re l0 cr 6 65 105 this indicates that the naturally developed boundary layer is in the turbulent state as illustrated by pope 2000 the reynolds number re θ based on the momentum thickness of the boundary layer θ is another signal of the laminar or turbulent boundary layer state in the present work re θ is around re θ 7000 which also indicates the developed boundary layer is in the turbulent state it can be seen from fig 2 that the velocity profiles follow a logarithmic profile in the range of z 0 0 4m at z 0 4m the mean velocity equals 0 99 times of freestream velocity i u increases dramatically with the decreases of z for z 0 4m and reaches around 12 at z d 0 01 as z 0 2m i u 1 is achieved for the freestream flow the boundary layer thickness is δ d 0 2 the turbulent friction velocity u is 0 023 according to the logarithmic profile which will be used in the wall normalization to perform a homogenously high turbulent flow in the wind tunnel a steel frame with 40 cm width square mesh grid was used locating 20d far away from the model square cylinder location the similar setup was used by so and savkar 1981 as can be seen in fig 2 under the perturbed freestream turbulent intensity condition the boundary layer thickness is unchanged at δ d 0 2 while the freestream turbulent intensity i u increases dramatically to 9 the following tests were conducted under identical testing conditions under two different freestream turbulent intensity for scenario 1 with i u 1 and scenario 2 with i u 9 3 results analysis 3 1 hydrodynamic forces hydrodynamic forces are first investigated in this section to quantify the influence of the gap ratio and reynolds number the drag and lift coefficient are calculated based on the pressure distribution measured along the middle cross section of the model pipe fig 3 shows the comparison of present c d and st with g d 2 for scenario 1 with i u 1 with the results of the experimental and numerical data discussed in the literature for an isolated cylinder g d c d and st are independent of the re and achieves at 2 0 and 0 137 respectively which agrees quite well with the previous data as shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the discrepancies among the previous data in fig 3 is attributed to that the hydrodynamic results are highly dependent on the freestream turbulent intensity which will be discussed in the following sec 3 4 in sec 3 1 3 3 the scenario 1 with i u 1 and δ d 0 1 has been investigated hydrodynamic forces c d c l and st can be defined as below 1 c d f d ρdu 2 l z 2 2 c l f l ρdu 2 l z 2 3 st f l d u where f d and f l are the integrated drag and lift forces respectively ρ is the fluid density l z is the spanwise cylinder length f l is the frequency of the fluctuating lift force the time averaged drag and lift coefficients are denoted as c d and c l respectively the root mean square lift coefficient c l is defined as 4 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 where n is the number of values in the time history of c l the variation trends of c d and c l with g d and re are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the data of martinuzzi et al 2003 for re 1 89 104 with δ d 0 5 is also included in the figure as a comparison the following observations can be found 1 c d and c l are insensitive to the influence of re in the range of re 7 34 104 4 12 105 including the cases with small gap ratio their curves for different re collapse together as shown in fig 4 2 results for the present work collectively have a good agreement with martinuzzi et al 2003 s data the discrepancies come from the different boundary layer thickness in martinuzzi et al 2003 s work the large boundary layer thickness δ d 0 5 leads that the square cylinder with a few gap ratio is partially immerged in the boundary layer the high turbulence in the boundary as shown in fig 2 will lead a reduction of c d whilst c l is less influenced 3 for g d 1 both c d and c l are independent of the gap effect c d is around 2 2 and c l is tending to 0 which agrees well with the data of isolated cylinder in martinuzzi et al 2003 and lee 1975 for 0 4 g d 1 c d and c l experience a sharp reduction as g d decreases which is corresponding to the increases of gap effect the minimum c l is observed to be around 0 83 at g d 0 4 for g d 0 4 c d keeps decreasing as the cylinder touching the wall whilst c l bounces back from the bottom peak and increases sharply the maximum value of c l achieves at around 1 1 for g d 0 001 this phenomenon is ascribed to the strong blockage effect of the small gap which is also reported by the near wall circular cylinder with g d 0 25 in yang et al 2018 s study the corresponding fluctuations of drag and lift coefficient c d and c l are shown in fig 5 for g d 1 c d and c l shows the strong independence of the gap effect and achieves the highest values which are c d 0 2 and c l 1 3 respectively the results for the scenario 1 with i u 1 match well with the results of luo et al 1994 and lee 1975 as shown in table 1 the highest values of c d and c l at g d 1 in fig 5 are ascribed to the periodic loading due to the vortex shedding in the wake which is also validated by the frequency power spectra based on the fourier analysis of lift time histories as shown in fig 7 the time history of lift coefficient is plotted in fig 6 for g d 2 0 8 and 0 2 for the large gap ratio both lift coefficients exhibit a regular sinusoidal variation which is corresponding to the vortex shedding process at g d 0 8 the variation of strength of lift coefficients is much smaller than their counterpart of g d 2 which indicates that the vortex shedding is weakened due to the wall proximity as the gap ratio is reduced to g d 0 2 no such regular variation is detected in fig 6 c which indicates the vortex shedding is completely suppressed fig 6 shows the energy spectra of lift coefficient for all cases at larger gap ratios the spectral peak near st 0 129 in fig 6 a corresponds to the kármán vortex shedding process whereas for the smaller gap ratio no prominent spectral peak has been found as the gap between the cylinder and bottom wall is further reduced the turbulent energy induced by the shedding frequency decreases this observation indicates that the distribution of the energy spectra over a wide range of frequencies the reason can be attributed to the fact that the shear layers from the cylinder get stretched in the wake region as the gap ratio is reduced and vortex street formation weakens as it shifts downstream it should be noted that the drag time histories show minor periodicity as a result of that the drag force is independent of the locations of the shedding vortex cores which has been illustrated by goldstein 1979 the largest peak for g d 0 4 as shown in fig 7 corresponds to the vortex shedding frequency and strouhal number st is achieving at st 0 129 while peaks at the higher frequencies with lower amplitude indicates the harmonics at 0 4 g d 1 c d and c l drop sharply to around 0 2 and 0 15 the dominant frequency can still be captured through the energy power spectra in fig 7 the amplitude however decreases monotonically with the decrease of g d as for g d 0 4 the amplitude of the energy power spectra is small and no spectral peak is observed at g d 0 3 the loss of periodicity indicates the supersession of vortex shedding at g d 0 3 the suppression of the vortex shedding starts from g d 2 to 0 4 with the gradual reduction of the amplitude of the energy power spectra martinuzzi et al 2003 bailey et al 2002b and bosch and rodi 1996 also observed the similar step by step suppression which is denoted by that the amplitude of the periodic fluctuations of the vortex shedding process deceases with the vortex shedding process continuing ohya 1989 reports a deflection of the jet created in the gap between the two cylinders at large reynolds number kim and durbin 1988 found that the jet may switch sides in a random fashion beyond a certain value of re brun et al 2004 observed a second peak of the frequency with st 2 st at a narrow gap which was attributed to the deflected jet in the gap however in the current experimental cases the second peak exists for all gap ratio cases which is related to the second harmonic as also observed by shi et al 2010 besides the two vortex shedding frequency expected to appear in the narrow wake the presence of higher frequency kelvin helmholtz vortices can be clearly identified in fig 8 the broad band peaks at f sl 1 3 for re 2 06 105 are consistent with the development of shear layer instability as discussed by prasad and williamson 1997 through the flow visualization zhou et al 2001 observed that the shear layer rolls up to form the vortical structures in the wake which was not observed to originate from vortex shedding prasad and williamson 1997 indicated that the broad band energy peak at a high frequency induced by the observed vortical structures was the signal of the kelvin helmholtz instability process it is believed that the influence of the small gap in the present experiments might yield a stronger adverse pressure gradient on the rear of the cylinder and thus induce a stronger separation and the enhanced shear layer instability growth brun et al 2008 observed that the number of kh structures did not grow but their size decreased and its corresponding position moves forward to the upper corner of the square cylinder kh structures were also observed to have a strong interaction with the recirculating flow along the wall according to the hydrodynamic forces four regimes are identified based on the above observations i g d 1 in which hydrodynamic forces is almost independent of the gap ratio ii 0 4 g d 1 in which the vortex shedding is continuing with gradual decay of the amplitude under the increased gap effect iii 0 3 g d 0 4 in which the blockage effect leads to strong lift coefficient and the normal vortex shedding is being supressed iv g d 0 3 vortex shedding is completely suppressed the classified regimes are very similar to the results of martinuzzi et al 2003 with δ d 0 5 however regime iii is different physical mechanism in the present work with δ d 0 1 the blockage effect in the small gap would entrain the flow passing through the gap and interrupt the separated shear layer rolls up and interacts this leads that the vortex shedding is suppressed as the cylinder is immersed in the large boundary layer martinuzzi et al 2003 with δ d 0 5 the high turbulence intensity plays the key role and will largely influence the shear layer separation which will be discussed in section 3 4 3 2 pressure distributions pressure distributions around a square cylinder is investigated in this section to quantify the influence of the gap ratio and reynolds number the pressure coefficient c p is defined as c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where the reference static pressure p 0 and velocity u are taken from a pitot tube in the upstream ρ is air density fig 8 presents the pressure distributions for four surfaces of the square cylinder under the influence of the gap ratio the surfaces of the square cylinder are denoted by number of 0 3 rather than angles for the circular cylinder surface 0 1 is in the front of the cylinder surface 1 2 is the surface in the gap surface 2 3 is in the wake of the cylinder and surface 3 0 is on the top of the cylinder based on the classified regimes discussed in sec 3 1 through hydrodynamic forces the corresponding pressure distributions will be investigated as shown in fig 8 in regime i where g d 1 the influence of the gap ratio is limited and c p are almost collapse together for all sides of the cylinder surface this is corresponding to hydrodynamic forces in fig 4 independent of g d the maximum c p is located at the middle point of surface 0 1 which is also defined as the stagnation point in the present work with the cylinder is touching the plane boundary the stagnation point moves to the gap side slightly and asymmetrical distributions of c p is achieved fig 9 further shows the distributions of fluctuating pressure c p around a square cylinder c p is defined as 5 c p 1 n i 1 n c p i c p 2 c p keeps at very low values at around stagnation point with the increase of gaps and achieves very high values at leading corner 0 and 1 the flow separations at leading edges are believed to be the reason for the high c p at two leading edges for surface 1 2 c p drops to 1 7 and keeps almost constant to surface 2 3 and surface 3 0 high c p is also observed at surface 1 2 2 3 and 3 0 for boundary layer separations on top and gap sides and the vortex shedding in the wake as shown in fig 10 a the base pressure c pb shows minor variations with the gap ratio indicating that the vortex shedding in the wake is relatively stable vickery 1966 and this is also validated by the c pb c pmin in fig 10 b c pb c pmin is represented as the adverse pressure recovery in the wake and is known to stabilize the flow van nunen 1974 achenbach 1968 roshko 1961 the less fluctuated c pb c pmin suggests the wake flow is independent of the gap ratio at regime ii for 0 4 g d 1 the pressure distributions don t change much whilst the base pressure c pb experiences an obvious reduction c pb c pmin experiences a sharp increase in the regime which indicates the adverse pressure gradient is strengthened as the gap is reduced and this is similar to the near wall circular cylinder in yang et al 2018 c p shows gradually decreasing trend with the decrease of the gap and this support the step in step suppression of vortex shedding discussed in sec 3 1 at regime iii for 0 3 g d 0 4 c p and c p at this transitional regime are alike the results of the regime ii with the reductions of c p and much lower c p which is strongly influenced by the blockage effect as g d decreases to g d 0 3 the stagnation point is observed to tend downward with decrease of c p at front surface 0 1 indicating the low momentum wall fluid impinges on the front surface due to the strong interference between the separated shear layer at the bottom surface and the viscous wall layer c p at corner 1 shows the sharp increase whilst it at the trailing corner 2 reduces dramatically c pb doesn t change much in this regime the reduction of c pb c pmin in fig 10 b is corresponding to strong blockage effect leads to very high values of c pmin at corner 1 3 3 vortex shedding vortex shedding has been discussed through c p as shown in fig 9 and frequency power spectrum in fig 7 the cross correlations r 0 for two leading edges in the middle sections of the square cylinder have been presented in fig 11 in a more quantitative manner the cross correlation of fluctuating pressure r 0 is also very useful to investigate this feature in as introduced by norberg 1993 r 0 is defined as 6 r 0 c p t c p g c p t 2 c p g 2 where c p t c p g are the fluctuating pressure force extracting at points near trailing corner 2 and 3 fig 12 a shows a typical cross correlation through c p at the corner 0 and 1 for g d 2 c p at two edges keeps up with each other and vortex shedding at two edges are strongly correlated the synchronization leads to a high value of r 0 which is near 0 91 in regime i as shown in fig 11 for regime ii with 0 4 g d 1 r 0 in fig 11 is kept in the range of 0 2 0 82 which is relatively smaller than their counterparts as g d 1 this reduction of r 0 is due to the interruptions in the shedding cycle bailey et al 2002b through flow visualizations bailey et al 2002a proposed that the flow was attached to the bottom face during these interruptions the reattachment process interrupts the flow recirculation from the leading edge to the wake for forming vortex shedding and as further decreases of gap ratio g d 0 4 r 0 achieves very low value the gradual decrease of r 0 for g d 0 3 0 4 also supports the observation that the vortex shedding is a step in step process and r 0 is close to zero as the cylinder is touching the plane wall corresponding to that periodic fluctuation is no longer be observed on the cylinder surface as shown in fig 12 b of g d 0 3 the reduction of r 0 is ascribed to the low frequency oscillations of the shear layer unsteadiness by castro and haque 1987 as r 0 becomes positive vortex shedding is no longer formed in the wake 3 4 influence of high turbulence intensity in most practical applications the free stream is usually turbulent most research focused on the boundary layer transition for an isolated cylinder has been conducted with a low freestream turbulent intensity in a water or wind tunnel cheung and melbourne 1983 observed a strong effect of high turbulent intensity up to i u 9 on the hydrodynamic forces for an isolated circular cylinder nakamura and ohya 1984 investigated the hydrodynamic forces around an isolated square cylinder with the turbulent intensity up to 10 the hydrodynamic features of the scenario 2 with i u 9 for g d are presented in table 2 together with the previous results in the influence of high turbulence intensity it can be seen that the results of present work have a good agreement with the previous literature at the similar flow conditions the investigations on the square cylinder with a plane boundary with high turbulence intensity is however quite rare in the present work a high incoming turbulence intensity has been employed through setting a steel mesh grid in the upstream far away from the cylinder as discussed in sec 2 through the setup i u increases dramatically to 9 the boundary layer thickness in this scenario keeps at δ d 0 1 fig 13 presents the hydrodynamic forces of the scenario with i u 9 comparing with results of the scenario with i u 1 at re 2 09 105 including the drag coefficient c d the lift coefficient c l the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient c d and c l similar to the analysis of scenario 1 four regimes were divided depending on the gap effect i at g d 1 independent of the gap effect c d of i u 9 is overall largely smaller than their counterparts of i u 1 which is also observed by lee 1975 for an isolated cylinder this phenomenon is ascribed to the dramatic rise of c pb at surface 2 3 comparing with pressure distributions for i u 1 in fig 8 lee 1975 proposed that two kinds of turbulence effect on the flow around the square cylinder the small scale turbulence can increase the growth of the separated shear layer and inherent instabilities through increasing the entrainment of the flow passing through the gap and the large scale turbulence can reduce the spanwise correlation nakamura and ohya 1984 indicated that the shear layer would reattach intermittently to the rear of the side faces and cause the recirculation region towards the downstream it is understandable that in fig 13 a both two kinds of turbulence effect would largely increase the base pressure c pb in surface 2 3 and thus leads to the reduction of c d for scenario 2 for the lift coefficient in fig 13 b c l of group i for i u 1 and 9 are all very close to zero which is due to be independent of the gap effect for the influence of the high turbulence intensity on the fluctuations of drag and lift coefficient c d and c l as presented in fig 13 c and d respectively c d and c l for i u 9 present a strong reduction comparing with their counterparts for i u 1 vickery 1966 suggested that the presence of large scale turbulence could minimized the correlation and leads to the re attachment of the separated shear layer the cross correlation of fluctuating pressure r 0 for leading edge 0 and 1 achieves around 0 72 in this regime much lower than r 0 0 91 of scenario 1 the base pressure c pb decreases drastically comparing with the results of scenario 1 as shown in fig 16 a which indicates the high turbulence also further suppress the vortex shedding in the wake ross 1964 roshko 1954 and this results in the reduction of fluctuating forces for regime i and this also can be validated through the distributions of the fluctuating pressure in fig 15 where c p 0 55 for g d 2 is much smaller than its counterpart c p 0 82 in scenario 1 see fig 17 regime ii is limited to 0 6 g d 1 in this regime c d and c l starts to largely reduce due to the influence of the gap the minimum c l is observed to occur at g d 0 6 with the further reduction of the gap ratio to 0 2 g d 0 6 regime iii c l for scenario 2 experiences a recovery as the cylinder is touching the plane wall the maximum reduction of c l is at g d 0 4 from c l 0 8 for i u 1 to c l 0 2 for i u 9 this is can be explained by the small scale turbulence in the gap that can enhanced the entrainment of the flow through the gap and increase the growth of the separated shear layer leading to a far smaller value of c p at the at the surface 1 2 as presented in fig 14 in regime ii and iii the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient c d and c l for i u 9 is obviously larger than the results of i u 1 and are seems to be less affected by the gap ratio as discussed in sec 3 2 the extraordinary reductions of c d and c l for i u 1 is due to the suppression of the vortex shedding it is believed that the high turbulence triggers the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder which results in the higher the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient at the small gap ratio in fig 13 and the fluctuating pressure c p as shown in fig 15 the adverse pressure recovery c pb c pmin in the two regimes experiences minor variations as shown in fig 16 b which is corresponding to smooth changes of c d and c l it should be noted that a very weak dominant frequency can still be captured in fig 18 for g d 0 2 with very low magnitude of the power spectra for regime iv the vortex shedding is completely suppressed at g d 0 2 corresponding to the positive r 0 table 3 presents the comparisons of reported critical gap ratios for the suppression of the vortex shedding together with results of the near wall circular cylinder it seems that the boundary layer thickness has very limited influence on the critical gap ratio for the square cylinder whilst the counterpart for the circular cylinder strongly depends on the flow conditions for the square cylinder the separation points are fixed at the leading edges as discussed by bailey et al 2002b the suppression of vortex shedding is due to the interruptions by the shear layer reattachment at the bottom surface of the square cylinder and this would lead to the entrainment of the vortex shedding on the other hand for a circular cylinder the separation point moves towards downstream with the decrease of g d the suppression of vortex shedding for a circular cylinder is results of viscous wall effect and the generation of opposite sign vorticity on the wall grass et al 1984 on the other hand the high turbulence intensity decreases the critical gap ratio to g d 0 2 in the present study it is believed that the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder are attributed to the continuation of vortex shedding at smaller gap ratio 4 concluding remarks a series of experimental tests has been conducted in the wind tunnel in the present work a total of 6 different freestream velocity in the range of 5 m s to 30 m s corresponding to re 7 34 104 4 12 105 were tested with two different freestream turbulent intensity i u 1 and 9 covering the influence of the gap ratio ranging from g d 0 3 the analysis focuses on the hydrodynamic features around the square cylinder with a plane wall boundary including the pressure distributions hydrodynamic forces and the vortex shedding two dimensional large eddy simulations les were employed to visualize the flow structures and shear layer instability the main conclusions are summarized as below for the scenario 1 with δ d 0 1 and i u 1 four regimes have been identified based on the influence of the gap as g d 1 the hydrodynamic features and vortex shedding are insensitive to the gap effect for 1 g d 0 4 the reductions of the strength of the vortex shedding and fluctuating forces are observed with the decrease of g d the increase of the base pressure c pb results in the decrease of the drag coefficient c d the vortex shedding can still be observed with the suppression of the flow separation in the gap side for 0 3 g d 0 4 in which the blockage effect leads to strong lift coefficient and the step in step vortex shedding is being supressed the amplitude of the periodic fluctuations of the vortex shedding process deceases with the vortex shedding process continuing as g d 0 3 the vortex shedding is observed to be completely suppressed the blockage effect leads to an entrainment of the flow passing through the gap and a low speed recirculation is formed at the plane boundary in the region of x d 7 75 the influence of high turbulence intensity on the square cylinder with a near wall is systemically investigated in the scenario 2 with δ d 0 1 and i u 9 the influence of high turbulence tends to increase the base pressure and reduce the drag coefficient of the square cylinder for large gap ratio i e g d 1 however for small gap ratios g d 0 6 the high turbulence triggers the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder which results in the higher the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient frequency analysis of velocity probes has been carried out to investigate the kelvin helmholtz kh instability induced by the shear layer separation at the leading

author steady flow around a square cylinder placed near a plane wall boundary is investigated experimentally in the present work covering the range of reynolds number of re 7 34 104 4 12 105 gap ratios of g d 0 3 with two different freestream turbulent intensity i u 1 and 9 the influence of reynolds number gap ratios and turbulent intensity on the hydrodynamic characteristics have been studied systematically two dimensional large eddy simulation les were employed for flow visualizations it is found that the hydrodynamic forces on a square cylinder are independent of re even for the very small gap ratio cases for the influence of the low turbulent intensity i u 1 the hydrodynamic features and vortex shedding are insensitive to the gap effect as g d 1 with the decrease of g d the increase of the base pressure c pb results in the decrease of the drag coefficient c d the amplitude of the periodic fluctuations of the vortex shedding process decreases with the vortex shedding process continuing as g d 0 3 the vortex shedding is observed to be completely suppressed the blockage effect leads to an entrainment of the flow passing through the gap and a low speed recirculation is formed at the plane boundary in the region of x d 7 75 high turbulence tends to increase the base pressure and reduce the drag coefficient of the square cylinder for large gap ratio for g d 0 8 the high turbulence triggers the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder which results in the higher fluctuating drag and lift coefficient the critical gap ratio for the vortex shedding suppression is reduced to g d 0 2 keywords square cylinder hydrodynamic vortex shedding steady flow near wall high reynolds number 1 introduction the flow around bluff bodies has attracted substantial attention for decades due to its engineering applications such as heat exchangers bridge piers and offshore platform and the academic importance on the boundary layer development shear layer instability vortex shedding and so on the circular and square cylinders are the basic representative models for bluff bodies for the circular cylinder many researchers found that with variations of reynolds number r e re ud ν in which u is the freestream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid flow dynamics around a circular cylinder changes dramatically including variations of vortex shedding boundary layer separations and hydrodynamic forces zdravkovich 1997 sumer and fredsøe 1997 fage 1929 for re 5 47 batchelor 1967 observed that a pair of stable symmetric vortices were formed in the wake of the circular cylinder as re further increases to re 194 williamson 1989 and jiang et al 2016 observed the regular two dimensional vortex shedding the cylinder wake starts to show three dimensional instability up to re 300 williamson 1989 the vortex street in the wake starts to transit to turbulent state at re 300 bloor 1964 and five regimes were classified based on the development of the turbulence in the wake and around a circular cylinder including subcritical critical supercritical upper transition and trans critical regimes as summarized by sumer and fredsøe 1997 in the subcritical regime re 3 105 the vortex street in the wake is completely turbulent and the separation of the boundary layer around the circular cylinder remains laminar state the drag coefficient keeps almost constant and strouhal number remains at around 0 21 sumer and fredsøe 1997 as the flow enters the critical regime 3 105 re 3 5 105 the separations of the boundary layer transits from the laminar to turbulent state the drag coefficient experienced an abrupt reduction from 1 2 to 0 3 and a strong non zero lift was also observed yang et al 2018 achenbach and heinecke 1981 with further increasing of r e in the supercritical regime 3 5 105 re 1 5 106 the boundary layer completely transits from laminar to turbulent the drag coefficient remains constant at around 0 3 and the energy of vortices in the cylinder wake reduces significantly schewe 1983 with further increase of r e the boundary layer around a circular cylinder becomes fully turbulent and the flow enters upper transition and trans critical regime different from the flow separation on the surface of a circular cylinder a square cylinder has sharp corners where the boundary layer separation is stationary different mechanism of boundary layer separation leads to different flow structures and hydrodynamic forces between circular and square cylinders norberg 1993 similar to the flow regimes of a circular cylinder r e is the governing factor on the wake flow structures of a square cylinder as re 50 sohankar et al 1998 observed a von kármán vortex street in the wake of the square cylinder with increasing of r e flow separations are observed at the trailing edge of the square cylinder at re 120 and at the leading edges at re 120

which is also referred as mode a instability luo et al 2003 2007 saha et al 2003 at this regime the drag coefficient declines with r e exponentially and the strouhal number increases with r e yoon et

minguez et al 2011 brun et al 2008 sohankar 2006 saha et al 2000 lyn et al 1995 lyn and rodi 1994 the shear layer is at the stable state and rolled up to form the von kármán vortex street in the wake of the cylinder the von kármán vortex street is well captured in the wake region and the kevin helmholtz vortices in the shear layer separated from the leading edge is also observed the strouhal number st is found to be declined at re c2 re 8 103 and kept constant with increasing of r e the drag coefficient increases gradually with increasing of r e at re c2 re 2 104 and keeps almost constant at re 2 104 the fluctuating lift and drag forces in this regime share a very similar feature with the drag coefficient who would increase with increasing of r e at 50 re 2 104 and keeps almost constant at re 2 104 yoon et al 2010 sohankar 2006 sohankar et al 1999 it is noted that the flow regimes based on r e is very sensitive to a number of factors such as freestream turbulence surface roughness aspect ratio blockage ratio etc tamura and miyagi 1999 observed that as the freestream turbulent intensity increased from 0 5 to 12 5 the drag coefficient experienced a reduction while the lift coefficient was independent the effect of a plane boundary on the flow around a square cylinder has also attracted substantial research interests in the past a few decades shi et al 2010b mahir 2009 martinuzzi et al 2003 liou et al 2002 bailey et al 2002a 2002b bosch and rodi 1996 bosch et al 1996 durao et al 1991 for a wall proximity cylinder the gap to diameter ratio g d and wall boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d have obvious influence on the boundary layer separation vortex shedding and hydrodynamic forces hwang and yao 1997 investigated the influence of the boundary layer thickness on the vortex shedding and hydrodynamic forces it was observed that strouhal number and drag coefficients presented a decreasing trend in a thick boundary layer δ d 5 and an increasing trend in a thin boundary layer δ d 0 8 as r e increases from 500 to 1500 bhattacharyya and maiti 2004 found that the critical gap ratio depended on r e in the range of up to re 1400 cheng et al 2007 observed the very similar phenomenon in the range of re 50 200 mahir 2009 successfully captured the transition from mode a to mode b in the wake of a square cylinder with g d 4 and 1 2 at re 175 250 durao et al 1991 reported that the critical gap ratio for suppression of the vortex shedding was at g d 0 35 by examining the predominant peak at the vortex shedding frequency spectrum at re 1 36 104 and δ d 0 8 as g d 0 35 the strouhal number was independent of g d and kept almost constant at 0 133 bosch et al 1996 observed that the critical gap was in a range of g d 0 35 0 5 at re 2 20 104 and δ d 0 13 as g d 0 75 the flow was almost same with that around a free cylinder bailey et al 2002a and bailey et al 2002b however found that the critical gap ratio was at g d 0 4 at re 1 90 104 and δ d 0 47 martinuzzi et al 2003 has systematically investigated the influence of the wall proximity on the vortex shedding of a square cylinder through investigating the mean values and fluctuating pressure distributions and drag and lift forces at re 1 89 104 and δ d 0 8 it was observed that the suppression of the vortex shedding was at g d 0 3 shi et al 2010b described the wake structures of a square cylinder through the particle image velocimetry measurement piv and found the critical gap ratio was at g d 0 4 however as the reynolds number extends to o 10 5 investigations on a square cylinder with a plane boundary is quite rare to the best knowledge of author with perspective to the flow visualizations on a square cylinder at the high reynolds number through the numerical apparatus the investigations are relatively scarce many studies suggest that rans model would have an underprediction of the flow characteristics using various eddy viscosity models bosch and rodi 1996 1998 have observed that the strength and frequency of the vortex shedding is underpredicted through k ε model due to the excessive turbulent kinetic energy at the stagnation region lübcke et al 2001 provided many flow features through explicit algebraic stress model however the results still show very large discrepancies with the experimental data as concluded by franke and rodi 1993 and iaccarino et al 2003 even if the improved rans modeling can capture the correct distributions of the laminar and turbulent region it still tends to underpredict the periodic vortex shedding motion in the wake based on the above knowledge the large eddy simulation les is regarded as the viable approach to capture the turbulent flow around the square cylinder sohankar et al 2000 and voke et al 2012 provided the good agreement with the previous experimental results such as the piv measurement by lyn et al 1995 and rodi 1997 that the les modeling is strongly dependent on resolution or the numerical dissipation of the scheme minguez et al 2011 and mankbadi and georgiadis 2015 reported the detailed flow features on the near wall region of an isolated square cylinder recently whilst the numerical simulations on the square cylinder with a plane wall boundary is quite scare motivated by exploring 1 influence of the gap ratio on the hydrodynamics of the square cylinder at high reynolds number 2 high turbulence intensity effect on the flow characteristic around a square cylinder with a plane wall boundary 3 flow visualizations on the dynamic structures at the near wall region a series of experimental tests through a wind tunnel facility have been carried out in the present work to measure the hydrodynamic forces and pressure distribution acting on a smooth square cylinder in the range of re 7 34 104 4 12 105 ten different gap ratios were launched with two scenario of freestream turbulent intensity being performed two dimensional large eddy simulations around a square cylinder with a plane boundary were employed as the supplementary to visualize the flow and capture the flow structures the rest of the paper is organized as following the details of the experimental setup are presented in sec 2 together with the measurements of the boundary layer profiles and the freestream turbulent intensity are summarized the main results and discussion of the experimental and numerical results are given in sec 3 and conclusions are given in sec 4 the numerical modeling setup and mesh dependency study of the numerical modeling are documented in appendix 2 experimental setup the experimental tests in the present work were conducted in a high speed wind tunnel facility located at dalian university of technology in china the working section of the wind tunnel is 15m 3m 3m in length width height the wind speed can be adjusted continuously from 0 m s to 90 m s the model square cylinder used in the present work was made of smooth transparent acrylic material with d 0 2m and the length of the model is 10d to eliminate the end effect two circular end plates with the diameter of 1m were installed on the two ends of the mode cylinder 35 pressure sensors were installed in the middle section of the model cylinder to measure the pressure distributions on the cylinder surface pressure sensors were connected to a dsm3400 data scanning system by pvc tubes with the diameter of 1 mm the sampling rate was 625hz and recording time was 90s for each case in the present work the whole model square cylinder was supported by two vertical beams in the middle of working section the plane boundary was made of smooth plywood material present work focuses on the smooth square cylinder on the plane boundary a sketch of the model setup is presented in fig 1 the incoming flow direction is set as x axis and the square cylinder is located at x 0 the y axis is along the cylinder axial direction the z axis is perpendicular to the plane boundary and z 0 is at the surface of the plane boundary the upstream length from the edge of plane boundary to the cylinder center is 8d in x direction and 10d in the downstream a pitot tube was installed in the upstream away from the model square cylinder placed outside the boundary layer to monitor the freestream velocity both p and p 0 were measured by the same pressure scanner connected to a pitot tube since all pressure signals were measured by the same pressure scanner the bias errors in c p and c p rms are negligible according to stern et al 1999 s study the total uncertainties of c p and c p rms were largely due to the precision limit of the pressure scanner estimated to be within 3 and 6 respectively the temperature during tests in the working section was around 8 10 c and the kinematic viscosity of air kept at 1 48 10 5 m2 s a total of 6 different freestream velocity in the range of 5 m s to 30 m s corresponding to re 7 34 104 4 12 105 were tested with 2 different freestream turbulent intensity i u covering g d 0 3 in order to provide a good flow quality in the test section turbulence should be kept at reasonably low level this needs a controlling effect to obtain the turbulence reduction in the wind tunnel kulak et al 2012 advised that the combination of honeycomb coarse mesh screens and contraction was the key for the reduction of turbulence intensity applications of the methods would lead to a much diminished turbulence level the high speed wind tunnel facility is equipped with flow stabilization section two turbulence reduction screens are uniformly located in the cross section of the wind tunnel for the screens the diameter of the mesh is 0 4 mm with a cell spacing of 6 cell cm in vertical direction and 7 cell cm in horizontal direction according to the turbulence reduction theories by scheiman and brooks 1981 the total turbulence reduction factor of the wind tunnel gird arrangement is equal approximately to 0 27 and 0 52 for axial and lateral turbulence respectively in order to improve flow quality by reducing lateral turbulence more efficiently the flow manipulator was designed in the stabilization section of the wind tunnel based on the theory of kulkarni et al 2011 the flow manipulator was constructed using pipes arranged in a honeycomb like structure a honeycomb structure is installed in the stabilization section for an additional decrease of turbulence the honeycomb structure is composed of pipe cells with a constant length to diameter ratio which is distributed in the cross section the honeycomb structure can reduce lateral turbulence effectively comparing with the turbulence reduction screens it is understandable that any lateral velocity fluctuation larger than its cell size is effectively absorbed and the smaller turbulence would decay rapidly due to the viscosity the wall thickness can be made as small as possible in order to maximize porosity which would result in minimizing the pressure losses a material of pvc pipe is taken into consideration for the designing of the honeycomb structure due to the economical reason and designing for the smooth wall the combination of the turbulence reduction screen and honeycomb structure can effectively reduce the axial and lateral turbulence respectively which would significantly improve the flow quality in the wind tunnel as indicated by loehrke and nagib 1972 the best turbulence reduction is being obtained when the honeycomb is installed upstream the screens proper combination of screens and honeycomb provided decease of i u to the range of around 1 for half of the maximum wind tunnel speed this corresponds well to many academic quality high speed tunnels found around the world kulak et al 2012 the velocity profiles in the plane boundary layer were measured at the location of x 0 with the model square cylinder removed through a turbulent flow instrument series100 cobra probe the sampling frequency of cobra probe is 2000hz and each location is recorded for 10s for measurement fig 2 presents the mean velocity and its turbulent intensity profiles in the plane wall boundary the turbulent intensity i u at the location of z is defined as i u z u z 2 u in which u z is the fluctuating velocity along the flow direction at the location of z and u is the mean value of freestream velocity the boundary layer thickness δ on the plane wall is determined at the level where its velocity equals 0 99 u schlichting 1979 derived the calculations of the boundary layer thickness δ in the laminar and turbulent state for the laminar boundary layer δ can be calculated as δ 4 91 l 0 r e l 0 0 5 which is based on applying blasius solution to the flow governing equations l 0 is the distance from the point to the plane boundary and re l0 is the reynolds number based on l 0 as re l0 increases to a critical value re l0 cr the boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent happens in the turbulent state δ can be estimated as δ 0 37 l 0 r e l 0 2 sayadi et al 2013 reported that re l0 cr is 3 5 105 for h type transition or 6 5 105 for k type transition in the present study u 0 10 m s is corresponding to re l0 cr 6 65 105 this indicates that the naturally developed boundary layer is in the turbulent state as illustrated by pope 2000 the reynolds number re θ based on the momentum thickness of the boundary layer θ is another signal of the laminar or turbulent boundary layer state in the present work re θ is around re θ 7000 which also indicates the developed boundary layer is in the turbulent state it can be seen from fig 2 that the velocity profiles follow a logarithmic profile in the range of z 0 0 4m at z 0 4m the mean velocity equals 0 99 times of freestream velocity i u increases dramatically with the decreases of z for z 0 4m and reaches around 12 at z d 0 01 as z 0 2m i u 1 is achieved for the freestream flow the boundary layer thickness is δ d 0 2 the turbulent friction velocity u is 0 023 according to the logarithmic profile which will be used in the wall normalization to perform a homogenously high turbulent flow in the wind tunnel a steel frame with 40 cm width square mesh grid was used locating 20d far away from the model square cylinder location the similar setup was used by so and savkar 1981 as can be seen in fig 2 under the perturbed freestream turbulent intensity condition the boundary layer thickness is unchanged at δ d 0 2 while the freestream turbulent intensity i u increases dramatically to 9 the following tests were conducted under identical testing conditions under two different freestream turbulent intensity for scenario 1 with i u 1 and scenario 2 with i u 9 3 results analysis 3 1 hydrodynamic forces hydrodynamic forces are first investigated in this section to quantify the influence of the gap ratio and reynolds number the drag and lift coefficient are calculated based on the pressure distribution measured along the middle cross section of the model pipe fig 3 shows the comparison of present c d and st with g d 2 for scenario 1 with i u 1 with the results of the experimental and numerical data discussed in the literature for an isolated cylinder g d c d and st are independent of the re and achieves at 2 0 and 0 137 respectively which agrees quite well with the previous data as shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the discrepancies among the previous data in fig 3 is attributed to that the hydrodynamic results are highly dependent on the freestream turbulent intensity which will be discussed in the following sec 3 4 in sec 3 1 3 3 the scenario 1 with i u 1 and δ d 0 1 has been investigated hydrodynamic forces c d c l and st can be defined as below 1 c d f d ρdu 2 l z 2 2 c l f l ρdu 2 l z 2 3 st f l d u where f d and f l are the integrated drag and lift forces respectively ρ is the fluid density l z is the spanwise cylinder length f l is the frequency of the fluctuating lift force the time averaged drag and lift coefficients are denoted as c d and c l respectively the root mean square lift coefficient c l is defined as 4 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 where n is the number of values in the time history of c l the variation trends of c d and c l with g d and re are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the data of martinuzzi et al 2003 for re 1 89 104 with δ d 0 5 is also included in the figure as a comparison the following observations can be found 1 c d and c l are insensitive to the influence of re in the range of re 7 34 104 4 12 105 including the cases with small gap ratio their curves for different re collapse together as shown in fig 4 2 results for the present work collectively have a good agreement with martinuzzi et al 2003 s data the discrepancies come from the different boundary layer thickness in martinuzzi et al 2003 s work the large boundary layer thickness δ d 0 5 leads that the square cylinder with a few gap ratio is partially immerged in the boundary layer the high turbulence in the boundary as shown in fig 2 will lead a reduction of c d whilst c l is less influenced 3 for g d 1 both c d and c l are independent of the gap effect c d is around 2 2 and c l is tending to 0 which agrees well with the data of isolated cylinder in martinuzzi et al 2003 and lee 1975 for 0 4 g d 1 c d and c l experience a sharp reduction as g d decreases which is corresponding to the increases of gap effect the minimum c l is observed to be around 0 83 at g d 0 4 for g d 0 4 c d keeps decreasing as the cylinder touching the wall whilst c l bounces back from the bottom peak and increases sharply the maximum value of c l achieves at around 1 1 for g d 0 001 this phenomenon is ascribed to the strong blockage effect of the small gap which is also reported by the near wall circular cylinder with g d 0 25 in yang et al 2018 s study the corresponding fluctuations of drag and lift coefficient c d and c l are shown in fig 5 for g d 1 c d and c l shows the strong independence of the gap effect and achieves the highest values which are c d 0 2 and c l 1 3 respectively the results for the scenario 1 with i u 1 match well with the results of luo et al 1994 and lee 1975 as shown in table 1 the highest values of c d and c l at g d 1 in fig 5 are ascribed to the periodic loading due to the vortex shedding in the wake which is also validated by the frequency power spectra based on the fourier analysis of lift time histories as shown in fig 7 the time history of lift coefficient is plotted in fig 6 for g d 2 0 8 and 0 2 for the large gap ratio both lift coefficients exhibit a regular sinusoidal variation which is corresponding to the vortex shedding process at g d 0 8 the variation of strength of lift coefficients is much smaller than their counterpart of g d 2 which indicates that the vortex shedding is weakened due to the wall proximity as the gap ratio is reduced to g d 0 2 no such regular variation is detected in fig 6 c which indicates the vortex shedding is completely suppressed fig 6 shows the energy spectra of lift coefficient for all cases at larger gap ratios the spectral peak near st 0 129 in fig 6 a corresponds to the kármán vortex shedding process whereas for the smaller gap ratio no prominent spectral peak has been found as the gap between the cylinder and bottom wall is further reduced the turbulent energy induced by the shedding frequency decreases this observation indicates that the distribution of the energy spectra over a wide range of frequencies the reason can be attributed to the fact that the shear layers from the cylinder get stretched in the wake region as the gap ratio is reduced and vortex street formation weakens as it shifts downstream it should be noted that the drag time histories show minor periodicity as a result of that the drag force is independent of the locations of the shedding vortex cores which has been illustrated by goldstein 1979 the largest peak for g d 0 4 as shown in fig 7 corresponds to the vortex shedding frequency and strouhal number st is achieving at st 0 129 while peaks at the higher frequencies with lower amplitude indicates the harmonics at 0 4 g d 1 c d and c l drop sharply to around 0 2 and 0 15 the dominant frequency can still be captured through the energy power spectra in fig 7 the amplitude however decreases monotonically with the decrease of g d as for g d 0 4 the amplitude of the energy power spectra is small and no spectral peak is observed at g d 0 3 the loss of periodicity indicates the supersession of vortex shedding at g d 0 3 the suppression of the vortex shedding starts from g d 2 to 0 4 with the gradual reduction of the amplitude of the energy power spectra martinuzzi et al 2003 bailey et al 2002b and bosch and rodi 1996 also observed the similar step by step suppression which is denoted by that the amplitude of the periodic fluctuations of the vortex shedding process deceases with the vortex shedding process continuing ohya 1989 reports a deflection of the jet created in the gap between the two cylinders at large reynolds number kim and durbin 1988 found that the jet may switch sides in a random fashion beyond a certain value of re brun et al 2004 observed a second peak of the frequency with st 2 st at a narrow gap which was attributed to the deflected jet in the gap however in the current experimental cases the second peak exists for all gap ratio cases which is related to the second harmonic as also observed by shi et al 2010 besides the two vortex shedding frequency expected to appear in the narrow wake the presence of higher frequency kelvin helmholtz vortices can be clearly identified in fig 8 the broad band peaks at f sl 1 3 for re 2 06 105 are consistent with the development of shear layer instability as discussed by prasad and williamson 1997 through the flow visualization zhou et al 2001 observed that the shear layer rolls up to form the vortical structures in the wake which was not observed to originate from vortex shedding prasad and williamson 1997 indicated that the broad band energy peak at a high frequency induced by the observed vortical structures was the signal of the kelvin helmholtz instability process it is believed that the influence of the small gap in the present experiments might yield a stronger adverse pressure gradient on the rear of the cylinder and thus induce a stronger separation and the enhanced shear layer instability growth brun et al 2008 observed that the number of kh structures did not grow but their size decreased and its corresponding position moves forward to the upper corner of the square cylinder kh structures were also observed to have a strong interaction with the recirculating flow along the wall according to the hydrodynamic forces four regimes are identified based on the above observations i g d 1 in which hydrodynamic forces is almost independent of the gap ratio ii 0 4 g d 1 in which the vortex shedding is continuing with gradual decay of the amplitude under the increased gap effect iii 0 3 g d 0 4 in which the blockage effect leads to strong lift coefficient and the normal vortex shedding is being supressed iv g d 0 3 vortex shedding is completely suppressed the classified regimes are very similar to the results of martinuzzi et al 2003 with δ d 0 5 however regime iii is different physical mechanism in the present work with δ d 0 1 the blockage effect in the small gap would entrain the flow passing through the gap and interrupt the separated shear layer rolls up and interacts this leads that the vortex shedding is suppressed as the cylinder is immersed in the large boundary layer martinuzzi et al 2003 with δ d 0 5 the high turbulence intensity plays the key role and will largely influence the shear layer separation which will be discussed in section 3 4 3 2 pressure distributions pressure distributions around a square cylinder is investigated in this section to quantify the influence of the gap ratio and reynolds number the pressure coefficient c p is defined as c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where the reference static pressure p 0 and velocity u are taken from a pitot tube in the upstream ρ is air density fig 8 presents the pressure distributions for four surfaces of the square cylinder under the influence of the gap ratio the surfaces of the square cylinder are denoted by number of 0 3 rather than angles for the circular cylinder surface 0 1 is in the front of the cylinder surface 1 2 is the surface in the gap surface 2 3 is in the wake of the cylinder and surface 3 0 is on the top of the cylinder based on the classified regimes discussed in sec 3 1 through hydrodynamic forces the corresponding pressure distributions will be investigated as shown in fig 8 in regime i where g d 1 the influence of the gap ratio is limited and c p are almost collapse together for all sides of the cylinder surface this is corresponding to hydrodynamic forces in fig 4 independent of g d the maximum c p is located at the middle point of surface 0 1 which is also defined as the stagnation point in the present work with the cylinder is touching the plane boundary the stagnation point moves to the gap side slightly and asymmetrical distributions of c p is achieved fig 9 further shows the distributions of fluctuating pressure c p around a square cylinder c p is defined as 5 c p 1 n i 1 n c p i c p 2 c p keeps at very low values at around stagnation point with the increase of gaps and achieves very high values at leading corner 0 and 1 the flow separations at leading edges are believed to be the reason for the high c p at two leading edges for surface 1 2 c p drops to 1 7 and keeps almost constant to surface 2 3 and surface 3 0 high c p is also observed at surface 1 2 2 3 and 3 0 for boundary layer separations on top and gap sides and the vortex shedding in the wake as shown in fig 10 a the base pressure c pb shows minor variations with the gap ratio indicating that the vortex shedding in the wake is relatively stable vickery 1966 and this is also validated by the c pb c pmin in fig 10 b c pb c pmin is represented as the adverse pressure recovery in the wake and is known to stabilize the flow van nunen 1974 achenbach 1968 roshko 1961 the less fluctuated c pb c pmin suggests the wake flow is independent of the gap ratio at regime ii for 0 4 g d 1 the pressure distributions don t change much whilst the base pressure c pb experiences an obvious reduction c pb c pmin experiences a sharp increase in the regime which indicates the adverse pressure gradient is strengthened as the gap is reduced and this is similar to the near wall circular cylinder in yang et al 2018 c p shows gradually decreasing trend with the decrease of the gap and this support the step in step suppression of vortex shedding discussed in sec 3 1 at regime iii for 0 3 g d 0 4 c p and c p at this transitional regime are alike the results of the regime ii with the reductions of c p and much lower c p which is strongly influenced by the blockage effect as g d decreases to g d 0 3 the stagnation point is observed to tend downward with decrease of c p at front surface 0 1 indicating the low momentum wall fluid impinges on the front surface due to the strong interference between the separated shear layer at the bottom surface and the viscous wall layer c p at corner 1 shows the sharp increase whilst it at the trailing corner 2 reduces dramatically c pb doesn t change much in this regime the reduction of c pb c pmin in fig 10 b is corresponding to strong blockage effect leads to very high values of c pmin at corner 1 3 3 vortex shedding vortex shedding has been discussed through c p as shown in fig 9 and frequency power spectrum in fig 7 the cross correlations r 0 for two leading edges in the middle sections of the square cylinder have been presented in fig 11 in a more quantitative manner the cross correlation of fluctuating pressure r 0 is also very useful to investigate this feature in as introduced by norberg 1993 r 0 is defined as 6 r 0 c p t c p g c p t 2 c p g 2 where c p t c p g are the fluctuating pressure force extracting at points near trailing corner 2 and 3 fig 12 a shows a typical cross correlation through c p at the corner 0 and 1 for g d 2 c p at two edges keeps up with each other and vortex shedding at two edges are strongly correlated the synchronization leads to a high value of r 0 which is near 0 91 in regime i as shown in fig 11 for regime ii with 0 4 g d 1 r 0 in fig 11 is kept in the range of 0 2 0 82 which is relatively smaller than their counterparts as g d 1 this reduction of r 0 is due to the interruptions in the shedding cycle bailey et al 2002b through flow visualizations bailey et al 2002a proposed that the flow was attached to the bottom face during these interruptions the reattachment process interrupts the flow recirculation from the leading edge to the wake for forming vortex shedding and as further decreases of gap ratio g d 0 4 r 0 achieves very low value the gradual decrease of r 0 for g d 0 3 0 4 also supports the observation that the vortex shedding is a step in step process and r 0 is close to zero as the cylinder is touching the plane wall corresponding to that periodic fluctuation is no longer be observed on the cylinder surface as shown in fig 12 b of g d 0 3 the reduction of r 0 is ascribed to the low frequency oscillations of the shear layer unsteadiness by castro and haque 1987 as r 0 becomes positive vortex shedding is no longer formed in the wake 3 4 influence of high turbulence intensity in most practical applications the free stream is usually turbulent most research focused on the boundary layer transition for an isolated cylinder has been conducted with a low freestream turbulent intensity in a water or wind tunnel cheung and melbourne 1983 observed a strong effect of high turbulent intensity up to i u 9 on the hydrodynamic forces for an isolated circular cylinder nakamura and ohya 1984 investigated the hydrodynamic forces around an isolated square cylinder with the turbulent intensity up to 10 the hydrodynamic features of the scenario 2 with i u 9 for g d are presented in table 2 together with the previous results in the influence of high turbulence intensity it can be seen that the results of present work have a good agreement with the previous literature at the similar flow conditions the investigations on the square cylinder with a plane boundary with high turbulence intensity is however quite rare in the present work a high incoming turbulence intensity has been employed through setting a steel mesh grid in the upstream far away from the cylinder as discussed in sec 2 through the setup i u increases dramatically to 9 the boundary layer thickness in this scenario keeps at δ d 0 1 fig 13 presents the hydrodynamic forces of the scenario with i u 9 comparing with results of the scenario with i u 1 at re 2 09 105 including the drag coefficient c d the lift coefficient c l the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient c d and c l similar to the analysis of scenario 1 four regimes were divided depending on the gap effect i at g d 1 independent of the gap effect c d of i u 9 is overall largely smaller than their counterparts of i u 1 which is also observed by lee 1975 for an isolated cylinder this phenomenon is ascribed to the dramatic rise of c pb at surface 2 3 comparing with pressure distributions for i u 1 in fig 8 lee 1975 proposed that two kinds of turbulence effect on the flow around the square cylinder the small scale turbulence can increase the growth of the separated shear layer and inherent instabilities through increasing the entrainment of the flow passing through the gap and the large scale turbulence can reduce the spanwise correlation nakamura and ohya 1984 indicated that the shear layer would reattach intermittently to the rear of the side faces and cause the recirculation region towards the downstream it is understandable that in fig 13 a both two kinds of turbulence effect would largely increase the base pressure c pb in surface 2 3 and thus leads to the reduction of c d for scenario 2 for the lift coefficient in fig 13 b c l of group i for i u 1 and 9 are all very close to zero which is due to be independent of the gap effect for the influence of the high turbulence intensity on the fluctuations of drag and lift coefficient c d and c l as presented in fig 13 c and d respectively c d and c l for i u 9 present a strong reduction comparing with their counterparts for i u 1 vickery 1966 suggested that the presence of large scale turbulence could minimized the correlation and leads to the re attachment of the separated shear layer the cross correlation of fluctuating pressure r 0 for leading edge 0 and 1 achieves around 0 72 in this regime much lower than r 0 0 91 of scenario 1 the base pressure c pb decreases drastically comparing with the results of scenario 1 as shown in fig 16 a which indicates the high turbulence also further suppress the vortex shedding in the wake ross 1964 roshko 1954 and this results in the reduction of fluctuating forces for regime i and this also can be validated through the distributions of the fluctuating pressure in fig 15 where c p 0 55 for g d 2 is much smaller than its counterpart c p 0 82 in scenario 1 see fig 17 regime ii is limited to 0 6 g d 1 in this regime c d and c l starts to largely reduce due to the influence of the gap the minimum c l is observed to occur at g d 0 6 with the further reduction of the gap ratio to 0 2 g d 0 6 regime iii c l for scenario 2 experiences a recovery as the cylinder is touching the plane wall the maximum reduction of c l is at g d 0 4 from c l 0 8 for i u 1 to c l 0 2 for i u 9 this is can be explained by the small scale turbulence in the gap that can enhanced the entrainment of the flow through the gap and increase the growth of the separated shear layer leading to a far smaller value of c p at the at the surface 1 2 as presented in fig 14 in regime ii and iii the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient c d and c l for i u 9 is obviously larger than the results of i u 1 and are seems to be less affected by the gap ratio as discussed in sec 3 2 the extraordinary reductions of c d and c l for i u 1 is due to the suppression of the vortex shedding it is believed that the high turbulence triggers the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder which results in the higher the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient at the small gap ratio in fig 13 and the fluctuating pressure c p as shown in fig 15 the adverse pressure recovery c pb c pmin in the two regimes experiences minor variations as shown in fig 16 b which is corresponding to smooth changes of c d and c l it should be noted that a very weak dominant frequency can still be captured in fig 18 for g d 0 2 with very low magnitude of the power spectra for regime iv the vortex shedding is completely suppressed at g d 0 2 corresponding to the positive r 0 table 3 presents the comparisons of reported critical gap ratios for the suppression of the vortex shedding together with results of the near wall circular cylinder it seems that the boundary layer thickness has very limited influence on the critical gap ratio for the square cylinder whilst the counterpart for the circular cylinder strongly depends on the flow conditions for the square cylinder the separation points are fixed at the leading edges as discussed by bailey et al 2002b the suppression of vortex shedding is due to the interruptions by the shear layer reattachment at the bottom surface of the square cylinder and this would lead to the entrainment of the vortex shedding on the other hand for a circular cylinder the separation point moves towards downstream with the decrease of g d the suppression of vortex shedding for a circular cylinder is results of viscous wall effect and the generation of opposite sign vorticity on the wall grass et al 1984 on the other hand the high turbulence intensity decreases the critical gap ratio to g d 0 2 in the present study it is believed that the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder are attributed to the continuation of vortex shedding at smaller gap ratio 4 concluding remarks a series of experimental tests has been conducted in the wind tunnel in the present work a total of 6 different freestream velocity in the range of 5 m s to 30 m s corresponding to re 7 34 104 4 12 105 were tested with two different freestream turbulent intensity i u 1 and 9 covering the influence of the gap ratio ranging from g d 0 3 the analysis focuses on the hydrodynamic features around the square cylinder with a plane wall boundary including the pressure distributions hydrodynamic forces and the vortex shedding two dimensional large eddy simulations les were employed to visualize the flow structures and shear layer instability the main conclusions are summarized as below for the scenario 1 with δ d 0 1 and i u 1 four regimes have been identified based on the influence of the gap as g d 1 the hydrodynamic features and vortex shedding are insensitive to the gap effect for 1 g d 0 4 the reductions of the strength of the vortex shedding and fluctuating forces are observed with the decrease of g d the increase of the base pressure c pb results in the decrease of the drag coefficient c d the vortex shedding can still be observed with the suppression of the flow separation in the gap side for 0 3 g d 0 4 in which the blockage effect leads to strong lift coefficient and the step in step vortex shedding is being supressed the amplitude of the periodic fluctuations of the vortex shedding process deceases with the vortex shedding process continuing as g d 0 3 the vortex shedding is observed to be completely suppressed the blockage effect leads to an entrainment of the flow passing through the gap and a low speed recirculation is formed at the plane boundary in the region of x d 7 75 the influence of high turbulence intensity on the square cylinder with a near wall is systemically investigated in the scenario 2 with δ d 0 1 and i u 9 the influence of high turbulence tends to increase the base pressure and reduce the drag coefficient of the square cylinder for large gap ratio i e g d 1 however for small gap ratios g d 0 6 the high turbulence triggers the growth of separated shear layer and inherent instabilities for the near wall cylinder which results in the higher the fluctuating drag and lift coefficient frequency analysis of velocity probes has been carried out to investigate the kelvin helmholtz kh instability induced by the shear layer separation at the leading

21057,the autonomous ship carrying valuable cargoes and passengers in a more effective and cost saving manner will soon be state of the art technology which most likely shall be introduced into the public horizon as the remote control mode within the foreseeable future the highly connected intelligent systems though come at the cost of the increased system vulnerability to cyber attacks to smooth this innovative system can be released into actual context of operation a novel stpa based methodology is proposed that synthesizes safety and security namely stpa synss in the novel method a comprehensive process to identifying hazards and revealing causal factors is provided hazard elimination mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed loop managed the insight regards the operations of the method was demonstrated in a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard the analysis process focused on encountering ship ship collision accidents and related security incidents results indicate that generated inadvertent intentional causal factors and developed elimination mitigation strategies can assist the processes of design and operational planning of the autonomous ships and its shore control centre further the proposed method of this paper also has general relevance for other intelligent systems keywords autonomous ships stpa system safety cyber security hazard analysis safety of maritime transportation 1 introduction innovation nowadays has been affecting manufacturing processes business development and corporate management the emergence of the internet of things and cloud computing technologies has marked the new era of industry 4 0 improvements in information and communication technologies and enhancement in analytical capabilities have created revolutionary developing opportunities in various industry sectors not surprisingly ship intelligence becomes an inevitable trend after ship automation in the development of the shipping industry however the current advanced technology and some intelligent tools do not fundamentally reduce the number of maritime accidents in the complex marine environment human factors still have been identified as the main cause of such accidents even if ships need experienced seafarers to achieve safe driving based on such background the concept of autonomous ship begins to step in popular consciousness in 2012 and 2015 the funding of the maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks munin project by the european union burmeister et al 2014 and rolls royce led advanced autonomous waterborne applications initiative aawa jalonen et al 2016 to outline the concept of autonomous ships and the vision of turning remote and autonomous shipping into a reality in march 2018 international maritime organization imo takes first steps to address autonomous ships and has commenced work to investigate safe secure and environmental friendly maritime autonomous surface ships mass operations in imo instruments msc 100 2018 prior to this imo has already begun to encourage the member states and international organizations to submit substantive proposals and comments on autonomous ships to maritime safety committee msc 99 msc 98 2017a msc 98 2017b at the same time many international organizations have also taken actions to strengthen the cooperation between users researchers authorities and others community who has interested in autonomous ships and their use which promotes the development of autonomous ships the results of such projects were encouraging one remarkable outcome is proposing the concepts and models attempting to evaluate the safety of autonomous maritime navigation wróbel et al 2018a aro and heiskari 2017 allal et al 2017 and related international maritime law issues karlis 2018 chwedczuk 2016 carey 2017 in general autonomous ships have received significant attention from the academic community and industry in recent years which have become a popular research topic as the initiatives to develop and implement autonomous ships into the global shipping industry are gaining momentum their safety remains in the spotlight it is argued that every effort shall be taken to ensure that autonomous ships at least do not undermine the current level of safety besides technical considerations and social controversies safety became the most important issue to resolve the conclusion of the above is that the occurrence of navigational accidents can be expected to decrease with the development of autonomous ships wróbel et al 2017 but more real time data is required and some issues still require addressing in order to reduce the uncertainties the traditional hazard identification approaches to safety such as hazard and operability analysis hazop failure mode and effect analysis fmea event tree analysis eta and fault tree analysis fta were developed for systems that were built more than 50 years these reliability and probability based approaches to safety analysis as applied in afore mentioned research is neither exhaustive nor free of significant drawbacks but as the complexity of system increases traditional bottom up or top down safety assessment tools become insufficient to assure the product safeness stringfellow et al 2010 such hazard analysis tools can only be performed for systems reliability structure of which is known for autonomous ships their concepts of design are still being developed and the final structure of the system remains uncertain therefore it is difficult to explore all the possible scenarios that may arise from the combination of the components behavior and to assess system safety in the reliability based form wróbel et al 2018b furthermore a large amount of system understanding and data for analysis comes from real accidents or case studies hence the traditional methods are not applicable to identify hazards of autonomous ships which focus to address failures based on accidents data driven and chain of events related to component malfunction zhou et al 2020a recently a new hazard analysis tool system theoretic process analysis stpa has emerged as an approach for improving the safety of modern complex systems leveson 2011 rooted in system theoretic accident model and process stamp leveson 2002 it has been widely applied in some engineering domains aps et al 2015 meng et al 2018 abdulkhaleq et al 2015 2017 williams 2015 salmon et al 2018 the above researches indicate the effectiveness of stamp stpa in the evaluation of modern complex and highly automated system safety which can better provide safety constraints to help mitigate those hazards some maritime related research applied stpa began to fade into spotlight in these two years aps et al 2017 zou 2018 rokseth et al 2017 valdez banda and goerlandt 2018 uddin and awal 2020 sultana et al 2019 and better to illuminate the prevailing causal factors not least the systemic ones especially wróbel et al first applied stpa to develop a suitable safety analysis model for autonomous merchant vessels wróbel et al 2018a and remotely controlled merchant vessels wróbel et al 2018b which identify the most likely safety control structure of the analyzed system and assess the impact of potential uncertainties to some extent wróbel s project and his contribution bridges a gap between the safety analysis based on a systemic approach and autonomous merchant vessels and provide an effective suggestion for future designers at the same time the most important is that the research results prove the effectiveness of stpa to access safety and identify hazards of autonomous ships sequentially solberg 2018 and zou 2018 applied stpa to a prototype of a fully autonomous ship called revolt solberg 2018 suggested improvements to this prototype based on the outputted results of hazard analysis and zou 2018 compared stpa with functional fmea and computer hazop valdez banda et al 2019 applied stpa in the initial design process of autonomous ships analyzed in detail the potential hazards of two urban autonomous ferry ships in turku finland and constructed the initial safety management strategy for guiding the design construction and operation of autonomous ships ventikos et al 2020 elaborated the significant contribution of stpa in ensuring the safety of autonomous ships and used stpa to execute the hazard analysis on an autonomous ship with multiple levels of autonomy the results indicate that the number of violated safety constraints is reduced but the mitigative control actions become less feasible with increasing autonomy additionally there is an increasing number of concerns with respect to the ship systems vulnerability to cyber attacks in the maritime industry imo 2020 fitton et al 2015 some studies aimed at trying to identify different attack scenarios on a cargo ship proposing some novel cyber risk assessment approaches tam and jones 2018 2019 kavallieratos et al 2019 and mitigation framework for improved resilience sahay et al 2018 autonomous ships are complex safety critical cyber physical systems cps of which safety and security are two crucial properties it is imperative to identity inter dependencies between safety and security for thoroughly assessing and managing potential risks therefore a combined safety and security co analysis of autonomous ships is being needed in this paper a novel safety and security co analysis methodology based on stpa was proposed and the feasibility of applying on hazard analysis of autonomous ships was explored the proposed method synthesizes safety analysis and security analysis into one concise framework comparing with existing works it introduces 6 improvements and provides a comprehensive process to identify hazards and reveal causal factors so as to achieve continuous tracking and closed loop management of potential system hazards furthermore the key question facing of preventing system losses is focused on system design that may cause system vulnerability and unacceptable losses meanwhile the new way of synthetic analysis is used to address the interdependencies of safety and security which to reduce the number of possible iterations that may be incurred by the requirement conflicts between safety and security in parallel approaches the results of analysis can be used by various stakeholders and provide important data for the design of autonomous ships operation 2 the concept of autonomous ships as the improvement of the automatic level of the ship smart ships have entered people s field of vision the smart ship is the highest level of automation not only with fully automated fixed mode automation but also intelligent decision making and judgment compared with conventional ships autonomous ships will be a highly integrated ship of various systems which is the advanced stage of smart ship development in general automated ships smart ships and autonomous ships are continuums of technological development in the navigation domain the differences between them are mainly reflected in the operation means there is little difference in the execution process results and operational instructions zhou et al 2019a however the overall design structure of autonomous ships shall be obviously different from nowadays conventional ships including bridge structure setting hull design propulsion system and energy management especially nearly all subsystems of autonomous ships will be controlled by remote or autonomous mode including collision avoidance decision making and ship state monitoring the vessel may be manned with a reduced crew or unmanned with or without supervision and have the capabilities to make decisions and perform actions with or without human in the loop to a varying degree it can operate independently from human interaction it is worth noting that the concept of autonomous ships is different from that of unmanned ships unmanned ships are only an important stage in the development of autonomous ships and they are the manifestations of autonomous ships reaching a high level of autonomy at present there are more than six international authorities have published their versions of levels of autonomy for ships zhou et al 2019a including lloyd s register norwegian forum for autonomous ships danish maritime authority maritime autonomous systems regulatory working group bureau veritas and imo among them the version of lloyd s register is the first representative document in global which divided levels of autonomy for ships into seven degrees namely al0 al6 lloyd s register 2016 furthermore imo imo 2018 adopted the taxonomy of autonomy levels was proposed by danish maritime authority in this paper the version described by imo was adopted which is shown as follows ship with automated processes and decision support m seafarers are on board to operate and control shipboard systems and functions some operations may be automated remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board r the ship is controlled and operated from another location but seafarers are on board remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board ru the ship is controlled and operated from another location there are no seafarers on board fully autonomous ship a the operating system of the ship is able to make decisions and determine actions by itself in this paper we focus on the remote control mode supported by shore control centre scc that corresponds to level r and ru in imo s description as shown in fig 1 according to the general opinion of technicians level r is a practical solution within the achievable range and level ru is the next achievement goal in unmanned navigation primary phase it s worth noting that most projects on autonomous ships are conditional upon the ships having been designed which need to be operated in the various autonomy of level for the duration of a single voyage given an example an autonomous ship will be operated via manual steering or remote control in densely trafficked areas whereas the ship will switch over to level a in open sea here autonomous ship is not necessarily autonomous the vessel traversing different seas will be monitored supervised and authorized by few operators onboard or scc receiving crucial information via satellite porathe et al 2014 in the upcoming of remote controlled navigation the task can be divided into three basic categories berth to berth including autonomous docking pilot point to pilot point navigation in open sea or deep water in these categories berth to berth mode has the highest requirement while the lowest in open sea mode the collecting processing and transmitting data from sensors onboard was transfer to scc shore based team analysis them to provide decision support to a unified bridge for remote controlled ships and to effective autonomous collision avoidance system kobyliński 2018 since scc is quite far from the ship itself there is no bodily feeling of the ship rocking and the look outside even if communicated via camera feeds could provide an only limited understanding of the conditions yemao et al 2014 the setting and interaction between scc and autonomous ships porathe et al 2014 may be potentially create further issues including limited situation awareness due to reduced sense of the ship information overload due to the plurality of ships and ship sensors and communication challenges due to limited knowledge on the local conditions or language issues wahlström et al 2015 furthermore such massive data transmission and interaction rely on digital communication between ships and between ship and shore and these connections are possible entry points to interfere with the ship s operation and result in threats rødseth and lee 2015 the potential hazards must be identified to ensure the safety and security of autonomous navigation in fact compared with manual navigation m level the remote control mode of autonomous ships will affect virtually all aspects of her operation especially for navigation all functions and potential hazards are mutually related and it is difficult to evaluate components individually meanwhile the new autonomy concept though comes at the cost of the increased system vulnerability to cyber attacks which may lead to unavailability or hazardous behavior of the critical ship systems although systematic hazard identification has been used to find critical safety hazards and how to address these for unmanned merchant ship rødseth and burmeister 2015 no existing approach can comprehensively assess the safety and security hazard associated with autonomous ships due to the novel combinations of sophisticated autonomy technologies and traditional maritime systems therefore an effective method aimed at safety and security co analysis of autonomous ships can execute the hazard analysis process to enhance the safety and security of the ship systems design 3 methods complexity in autonomous systems reaching a new level and the majority of hazard analysis methods currently based on the assumption becoming less effective role of humans in systems is changing so we need a paradigm change to deal with safety in modern systems from the focus on component reliability to systems thinking 3 1 review of stpa and its extensions in stamp safety is treated as a dynamic control problem rather than failure prevention or a reliability problem which expands the traditional model of causality beyond a chain of directly related failure events or component failures to include more complex processes and unsafe interactions among system components stpa is a proactive analysis method and stamp based tool applied during system development the goal of stpa is to develop causal accident scenarios that encompass the entire accident process and not just component level failures and events and their effect on the system operation later stpa sec was proposed as an extension of stpa that considered security young and leveson 2013 2014 which identifies and enforces required constraints on unsecure control actions that place the system in vulnerable states when subjected to disturbances stpa sec has raised the attention of securing the system from a different perspective which aims to ensure the critical functions and maintain the service provision in the face of disruption meanwhile the method motivated relevant studies such as stpa safesec friedberg et al 2017 stpa priv shapiro 2016 systems theoretic likelihood and severity analysis stlsa temple et al 2017 and some improvement of stpa stpa sec for safety and security co analysis schmittner et al 2016 erik nilsen et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 although the authors of the above studies are aware of the safety and security are intertwined in the safety critical system which needs to be considered simultaneously the primary goal of an integrated safety and security analysis has not been achieved stpa sec as a security oriented derivative of stpa argues that security is only relevant with respect to its impact on safety this is a limited view of the system perspective the guidance for the integration of safety and security into a unified analysis process equally the identification of intentional causal scenarios and how to perform the security analysis was not provided stpa safesec aims to address the above mentioned shortcomings and improve the capability of stpa stpa sec which deeply integrates safety and security it extends and refines the core modeling technique of stpa including extends the safety focused causal factor guidance into the security domain links the abstract control structure to the physical system design introduces lists of general integrity threats and general availability threats stpa safesec appears most promising due to its recognition of the need for deep integration between system safety and security however the technique does not address stpa s need for increased rigor in analysis the derived temporary terminology lists and guidewords lack the theoretical grounding there is no discussion of the development path of identified threats and how the hazards were evaluated to generate potential mitigation strategies additionally the effectiveness analysis of these presented mitigation strategies has not been proceeded autonomous ships are dependent on the extensive use of digital and communications technologies throughout their operational life which the decision making process would be highly affected by digital information that is collected along a voyage and transmitted to shore increased interconnectivity between ships personal devices and on shore infrastructure has improved operational efficiency and physical safety but it also enables an increase of cyber attacks currently cyber security has been starting to be a high priority for the maritime industry disruption of network and information systems operations can lead to financial and environmental damage or even endanger human safety therefore security and safety should be considered as equally important properties that affect each other there are integrated approach and unified approach are identified regarding as the co analysis of safety and security an integrated approach analyzes safety and security separately and then integrates the results while a unified approach analyzes safety and security jointly lisova et al 2019 the former reduces the insight of the analysis leading to unbalanced results while the latter provides more rigorous results with better understanding of potential conflicts between safety and security despite the diversity most of the existing works on the joint analysis of safety and security tackle security only as a peripheral or constituent of safety largely neglecting the intertwining between safety and security in the safety critical system simultaneously none of the previous studies conducted the safety and security co analysis processes aimed at autonomous ships especially the suitable co analysis methods have not been proposed to smooth the introduction of autonomous ships and ensure the safety security of maritime transportation the new way of joint safety and security analyses that treat their interdependencies is needed which to reduce the number of possible iterations that may be incurred by the requirement conflicts between safety and security in parallel approaches 3 2 the proposed method system safety is the formal process of identifying and controlling mishap risk the hazard analysis provides the basic foundation for system safety which is performed to identify hazards hazard effects and hazard causal factors ericson 2015 the analysis process focuses on recognizing hazards that may arise from a system or its environment documenting their unwanted consequences and analyzing their potential causes this is a process whereby safety is achieved through the identification of hazards the evaluation of hazards and the control of hazards presenting unacceptable risk in general safety and security were treated as different system properties security related causes can lead to safety related losses and safety related causes can lead to security related losses accordingly however safety is regarded as preventing inadvertent losses by benevolent actors while security is regarded as preventing deliberate losses by malicious actors it can be argued that there is little distinction between safety and security other than the intentions of the actors both of them are ultimately focused on the high level goal of preventing losses from the perspective of system engineering in order to make the entire socio technical system as a whole in achieving security and safety it should not be overly constrained to low level hardware or operator behavior but should use more efficient and resolve potential conflicts between safety and security early in the development process of system currently security and safety both attempt to prevent losses in complex software controlled systems central to stpa is to identify the unacceptable consequences in this paper a novel stpa based methodology was proposed that synthesizes safety and security stpa synss to execute the full hazard analysis process hazard analysis process is a formal process which includes hazard identification hazard evaluation and hazard control as depicted in fig 2 on the basis of identifying hazard effects and hazard causal factors the proposed stpa synss can be used to determine the significance of hazards and to establish design measures that will eliminate or mitigate the identified hazards as a continuing closed loop iterative process stpa synss can effectively tracked potential hazards until acceptable closure action is implemented and verified furthermore cyber security is considered as a strategic issue but not a tactic issue stpa synss focuses on how to control system vulnerabilities rather than how to avoid threats the reframing of co analysis method shifts security analysis from guarding against attack to broader system design it can prevent not only system losses from know threats but also system losses introduced by unknown threats such as malicious insiders the workflow of stpa synss is given in fig 3 the aim of the proposed method is to address the above mentioned identified limitations of existing alternatives and introduces the following improvements 1 stpa synss frame the full stpa based hazard analysis process and elevate the security and safety to equal priority hazard elimination mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed loop management of potential hazards can be implemented 2 considering the impact of security on system safety from a high level strategic rather than a tactical perspective the key question facing of preventing security related losses was focused on the unrequested design that creates system vulnerability the method prevents not only disruptions from known threats but also disruptions introduced by unknown threats such as malicious insiders 3 the security concerns of non traditional stakeholders that is security related losses were included in the unacceptable losses further the definition of the term accident and loss was distinguished that an accident incident can lead to one or more losses to fill the gap between the generic losses and further analysis the inter step of identifying the safety accidents and the security incidents are integrated into the analysis process 4 to overcome the limitation of prior knowledge required to build the functional control structure the functional requirements derived from safety security constraints were introduced and the model elements and their responsibility were identified at the desired abstraction level which to facilitate the development of control structures 5 generating the mapping between the abstract control loops and the physical components to refine the constraints and derive more specific causal factors which shows the visualization of identified model elements and their responsibilities meanwhile refined safety security constraints can be mapped to the physical components so that provide guidance for the description of hazard components 6 the generation of loss scenarios was extended into the security domain which intended as a starting point for further thoughts and the investigation of the intended and malicious activation of unsecure control actions the identification of loss scenarios was distinguished into two different categories inadvertent scenarios and intentional scenarios the stpa synss can be used at any stage of the system life cycle the aim of analysis is to determine how the behavioral safety security constraints which are derived from system hazards can be violated and how to prevent such violations the ultimate goal is to design elimination or mitigation strategies based on generated loss scenarios and evaluated hazard components summarily the workflow of proposed method executed in following steps step 1 define purpose of the analysis in the first place the methodology begins by defining the scope of the analysis the system boundaries need to be explicitly defined and the system goals need to be described secondly the unacceptable losses accidents incident need to be defined accidents or incidents are possibly identified from mission scenarios which can provide a more comprehensive understanding than generally unacceptable losses especially the improvement can be linked to defined unacceptable losses and provide a structured and concrete link to further analysis the next sub step is to define the system level hazards by identifying system states or conditions that will lead to a loss in worst case environmental conditions to avoid the ambiguity for safety and security co analysis the following safety oriented and security oriented terms would be adopted to establish a common understanding the resulting terminologies were shown in table 1 if appropriate these identified system level hazards can be refined into sub hazards to facilitate more in depth understanding of system level hazards and support the construction of the hierarchical control structure moreover once the system level hazards are identified it is straightforward to identify system level constraints that must be enforced step 2 model the control structure finally the functional requirements derived from safety security constraints are proposed as an intermediate step to link the system level constraints and the control structure this introduction converts the abstractive system constraints into concrete requirements and is used to refine the properties that the control loop should have importantly the functional requirements are an effective addition to facilitate the development of the control structure especially for innovative system lacked prior knowledge this step identifies the model elements and their responsibilities including controller s controlled process es actuator s and sensor s the control action derived from the responsibilities would enforce constraints on the behavior of the controlled process the defined responsibilities and the functional requirements derived from high level safety security constraints can be used to bridge the gap between the hierarchical control structure and identified system level hazards in this step the focus of the hierarchical control structure is functional relationships and functional interactions rather than typically capture purely physical or geometric relationships step 3 identify the unsafe unsecure control actions once the control structure has been modeled the next step is to identify ucas to provide adequate control the controller must have an accurate model of the process usually there are the inconsistencies between the process model used by the controller and the actual process state which will lead to accidents especially in a complex system herein the control actions and process model variables would be captured to completed the step process model variables are measurable indicators of the conditions that trigger a control action to keep the safety of a system it can be used for establishing the context for ucas causal factors and scenarios the control actions are actions necessary for each element to execute their responsibilities which can be distinguished with the following four potential ways of inadequate control leveson 2011 1 not providing the control action leads to a hazard 2 providing the control action leads to a hazard 3 providing a potentially safe control action but too early too late or in the wrong order 4 the control action lasts too long or is stopped too soon for continuous control actions not discrete ones step 4 generate loss scenarios in this step the violations of safety security constraints or how they can occur would be identified which describes the causal factors that can lead to ucas and to hazards the loss scenarios should be considered in the following factors as shown in fig 4 including controller related actuator related sensor related controlled process related reasons and their interactions the mapping between control loop and physical components are introduced in stpa synss which shows the running of interactions in physical components furthermore these potential causal scenarios were considered into two different ways to implement safety and security co analysis process inadvertent acts and intentional acts the generation of component level safety security constraints need to rely on the above results step 5 describe and evaluate hazard components the step is the second phase of the hazard analysis that is hazard evaluation the hazard is an entity containing only the necessary and sufficient elements that caused a safety accident or security incident which defines the necessary conditions for an accident incident and the end outcome or effect of the accident incident three necessary and coupled components consists the hazard triangle including hazardous element he initiating mechanism im target and threat t t as illustrated in fig 5 based on the results of hazard identification step 1 4 the hazard components need to be described and evaluated which is regarded as the input of designing elimination or mitigation strategies however significantly the precise probabilities of system transitioning to an unsafe unsecure state were given that is very challenging bjerga et al 2016 particularly in initial phases of system development due to lack of historical data and sufficiently accurate models wróbel et al 2018a leveson 2011 step 6 design elimination or mitigation strategies accidents incidents are the immediate result of actualized hazards the hazard transitions from a conditional state to an accident state when the components within the hazard are in a specific alignment the actuation process also was shown in fig 5 the hazard analysis process is a formal process of intentionally designing in safety by designing out hazards hazard identification and elimination mitigation is the key to this process as shown in fig 5 the necessary condition for hazard to exist is that all three sides of the triangle must be present remove any one of the triangle sides can result in the hazard is eliminated when hazard elimination is not possible the next objective is to reduce the probability of the accident incident and or the severity of the accident incident the potential elimination or mitigation strategies were presented in fig 6 4 results in this section the proposed method was applied to the r level of autonomous ship that is the remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board the intention is to enhance the safe navigation and manoeuvering of autonomous ships and demonstrate how a full hazard analysis process can be accomplished for the system now there is a consensus that the shift towards autonomous ships will most likely follow the gradual transition from lower to higher levels of autonomy rather than an instant change from the manned ship to unmanned ship zhou et al 2019b fan et al 2020 coping with the strong needs of the shipping industry for digital transformation the remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board that is r mode is regarded as the most likely to be introduced within the foreseeable future therefore this case study only concentrates on the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard considering the limited space the ru mode will be discussed in future work according to the annual overview report published by the european maritime safety agency emas 426 accidents resulted in a total of 696 lives lost from 2011 to 2018 emsa 2019 as depicted in fig 7 in the last eight years navigational casualties represent more than 54 4 of all casualty events where vessel was involved with collisions 26 2 contacts 15 3 and grounding stranding 12 9 the collision is the main type of maritime accidents where fatalities occurred despite the fact that the overall design structure of autonomous ships shall be obviously different from nowadays conventional ships but the concept of former is still an extension of the latter meanwhile in our previous research zhou et al 2020b the potential conflicts and barriers have been identified when applying the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea 1972 colregs to autonomous ships which can build up an effective basis for this study therefore in this case study the safety and security co analysis would be executed for the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard focused on collision avoidance 4 1 define purpose of the analysis step 1 at the beginning of the analysis the purpose needs to be described including the system boundary and goal in this case the system boundary covers the operation of a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard the goal of analysis is to support the introduction of autonomous ships while minimizing collision risk maintaining profitable operations afterwards the unaccepted losses relevant to this phase are defined as follows l 1 loss of life or serious injury to people l 2 loss or damage to the ship or objects outside the ship l 3 loss of transportation mission l 4 loss of confidentiality integrity and availability of the mission data l 5 environmental loss l 6 loss of feasibility for the introduction of autonomous ships according to the goal of analysis accident and incident were identified by enumerating concrete mission scenarios and linked to their corresponding losses a 1 the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard collides with other ships l 1 l 2 l 3 l 5 l 6 i 1 unauthorized access to confidential information l 4 l 6 herein i 1 may cause the occurrence of a 1 but i 1 is the individual incident also can result in other system losses including once the system boundary and goal are identified the next step is to define the system level hazards system level safety security constraints sc and functional requirements fr accordingly h 1 the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard violates minimum safe distance of approach that should be maintained from other ships during their encountering a 1 sc 1 the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard must

2 confidential information is accessed by unauthorized entity or person i 1 sc 2 confidential information must not be accessed by unauthorized entity or person fr 2 the access to confidential information must be authorized 4 2 model the control structure step 2 in this step it is required to model a hierarchical safety control structure based on the responsibilities of all the model elements and functional requirements up to now the design concepts of the remotely controlled ship are still being developed and the final structure of the system remains uncertain however many positive attempts deserve to be referred burmeister et al 2014 wróbel et al 2018b bolbot et al 2020 lagouvardou 2018 abilio ramos et al 2019 heikkilä et al 2020 utne et al 2020 ramos et al 2020 valdez banda et al 2019 kavallieratos et al 2020 zou 2018 zhou et al 2019a gil et al 2019 solberg 2018 and available drawings for similar ships was introduced in addition the brainstorming workshop was organized to discuss the necessary model elements with experts including engineers of ship design institute nautical scientists researchers focused on autonomous ships the functional control structure of a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard during the voyage is given in fig 8 scc is a generally accepted terminology for the facility controlling or supervising autonomous ship zhou et al 2020a in this functional control structure the main responsibility of scc is to control the ship supervise the voyage and initiate a fallback strategy in an emergency during the voyage shore ship reliable and precise communication is one of the most vital to remotely controlled vessel s safety security hence scc will use the dedicated secure satellite communication link to transmit the necessary data with the remotely controlled ship the communication controller is responsible for controlling over information flow and ensuring the security communications are readily available based on the declaration of imo autonomous ships may switch between various operational modes with different levels of autonomy due to rapidly changing environment or complex nature of tasks for a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard one or a few persons trained for navigational watch and manoeuvring of the ship will be on standby at manual control station onboard who ready to receive control assume the navigational watch and communicate with other ships via very high frequency vhf only when necessary or in an emergency in this context the operation mode consists of three categories including scc control mode autonomous operation mode and manual control mode the scc control mode is a general mode herein scc possesses full control for ships the decision making and action taking all are done by operators of scc however the autonomous operation mode can be activated when the ship is performing some predefined plans or low complexity tasks for example sailing in open sea with good weather and sea conditions at this moment the decisions and actions are performed autonomously with human supervision and authorization including the operator of scc and officer of the watch oow at manual control station onboard meanwhile they have the right to intervene high impact decisions once the external environment changes the autonomous operation mode can be switched back to scc control mode at any time furthermore scc can request oow to receive the control of ship in necessary or emergency that is the manual control mode which is to ensure the navigation safety such as the communication between scc and ship is unexpectedly interrupted in this case the level of autonomy will be shifted to level m under normal considerations the remotely controlled ship is operated by operators of scc or execute autonomous navigation in predefined plan and operational envelope without human intervention the autonomous navigational functions are conducted by the autonomous navigation system ans with the help of the advanced environmental sensor module according to the setting procedure ans is basically only active in the autonomous operation mode it consists of two separate sub systems including route planning and collision avoidance the route planning module can optimize the anticipatory voyage plan based on the ship s hydrodynamics with regard to fuel efficiency for a given weather forecast while collision avoidance algorithm works with a formalized description of colregs to calculate colregs compliant deviation measures for a given traffic situation to meet the functional safety requirements of remotely controlled ships the environmental sensor module needs to include global navigation satellite systems gnss automatic identification system ais electronic chart display information system ecdis global maritime distress and safety system gmdss light detection and ranging lidar laser detection and ranging ladar high definition cameras with infrared capability radar with automatic radar plotting aid arpa gyrocompass log and echosounder data fed by environmental sensor module is used to provide situation awareness to operators of scc and provide the ans with a perception of the vicinity of the ship including own ship s navigational states environmental conditions target data for detected obstacles as well as real time tracking data the autonomous engine monitoring and control aemc system consists of propulsion and steering subsystem auxiliary engines and other auxiliary machinery which is responsible for controlling the ship s speed and course according to commands from scc manual control station or ans and receiving all observed measuring values of the engine room including rudder angle main engine revolutions fuel consumption combustion temperature engine temperature generator voltage and frequency control generator load in kw and etc furthermore aemc system can identify potential errors before they result in a malfunction and determine effective countermeasures including ans all feedback and information will be integrated in integrated bridge system ibs to implement configurations and reconfigurations which helps oow onboard and operators of scc monitor the effectiveness of actions taken importantly all of them need to be loaded and saved into voyage data recorder vdr 4 3 identify the unsafe unsecure control actions step 3 herein 17 control actions and 14 feedbacks were identified in the interest of saving space the details of the intermediate steps of the method are presented only for ibs and its interactions with aemc system in the control loop ibs as a controller while aemc system as the controlled process in this case study we focus mainly on this control loop and proceed by refining the control responsibilities of ibs as 1 receiving commands from scc manual control station or ans and imposing control towards aemc system to adjust course speed of the ship in real time 2 configuring the propulsion and steering system auxiliary engines and other auxiliary machinery to the operating mode in line with the current navigational states via aemc system to ensure sufficient reliability low emissions and sufficient maneuverability 3 configuring the environmental sensor module to an operating mode that conforms to the current navigational states the related control actions and feedbacks are briefly explained in table 2 in this control loop no 3 and no 27 are control inputs from another controller before proceeding to the next step the process model variables for ibs need to be defined which based on an assessment on what ibs needs to know to satisfy the control responsibility in this control loop the following variables can be identified process model variable 1 navigational intentions of other ships during ship ship encountering an assessment of navigational intentions is necessary to determine whether the course control and speed control of the own ship meet the requirement of safety encountering process model variable 2 ship types of other ships during ship ship encountering to make appropriate collision avoidance decisions it is necessary for ibs to know which type of the other ship it is for example if the own ship is a power driven vessel the collision avoidance decision making will be different that depends on the target ship is a power driven vessel sailing vessel fishing vessel vessel not under command vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre or vessel constrained by her draught etc process model variable 3 target ship s navigational states to make appropriate collision avoidance decisions it is necessary for ibs to know to assess the navigational states of the target ship process model variable 4 own ship s navigational states to make appropriate collision avoidance decisions it is necessary for ibs to know to assess the navigational states of the own ship process model variable 5 minimum safe distance of approach to other ships during ship ship encountering necessary to know to assess what is an appropriate minimum safe distance of approach these identified process model variables are used for establishing the context for ucas causal factors and potential loss scenarios meanwhile in this step the ucas of ibs are identified by analyzing the colregs compliance of control actions and the feedback control loops in the control structure that is constructed in the previous step in this case study the situation only is considered where the own ship and the target ship are all power driven vessels the results were presented in table 3 4 4 generate loss scenarios step 4 now that we have identified the ucas cause system hazards which is to identify system flaws that enable hazardous control actions the traditional stpa only focus on the safety domain while the violation of safety constraints and security constraints were considered in the stpa synss in this step the loss scenarios were generated to facilitate deeper insights and understanding which were divided into inadvertent losses and intentional losses during the generation process the control loop will be mapped to physical components that refine the constraints and derive more specific causal factors fig 8 have shown the physical components in environmental sensor module according to the definition of loss scenario the causal factor is critical that derive the description of loss scenario therefore to refine description and facilitate the evaluate hazard components the identified causal factors were presented instead of full loss scenarios in table 4 if necessary it only needs to add the corresponding context of the identified causal factors to generate whole loss scenarios including the controllers that can provide the control actions the context of occurred ucas the link to system level hazards or sub hazards for example the loss scenario of uca 1 1saf can be described that the ownship shall so far as possible take early and substantial action to keep well clear when the ownship is a give way ship only if risk of collision exists but the course speed control cannot be provided due to the physical failures of ibs and its components as a result the ownship may violate minimum safe distance of approach that should be maintained from other ships during their encountering the causal factors in table 4 represent the preliminary results of stpa synss which are prerequisites for the occurrence of the loss scenarios in addition the degradation of systems and components over time would cause negative impacts this consideration will be discussed in our future work for remotely controlled vessels concrete system components are still being discussed such as physical actuators between controller and controlled process it is difficult to implement full mapping to physical components in this paper however the proposed hazard analysis method provides a novel idea to address the issues that component level safety security constraints this work is necessary that will be completed in the following work 4 5 describe and evaluate hazard components step 5 in this step hazard components need to be described and evaluated including he im and t t due to the limited space the description and evaluation will furthermore focus on the uca 3 above according to the definition of hazard components the identified causal factors for ucas are described as im and he can be identified by using hazardous element checklists as shown in table 5 herein the case study was focused on reducing the occurring of collision accident therefore the he and t t are same for different causal factors for uca 3 the t t represents the severity of the accident which can be redirected to the unacceptable losses defined in the initial step of the analysis once the hazard components have been described the next step is to evaluate the probability of im and the severity of t t hazards will always exist but their risk must and can be made under the acceptable scope which the level of risk need to be made by decision authority the evaluation in this step aiming to build the foundation of possible risk assessment however due to the lack of empirical data nowadays it is difficult that calculating the precise probabilities of a system transitioning to an unsafe state especially for the remotely controlled ship nevertheless the design of elimination or mitigation strategies are regarded as being efficient when it comes to accident prevention and damage reduction in the worst case scenario 4 6 design elimination or mitigation strategies step 6 the design process will involve safety driven security driven optimization of the system which aiming primarily at the elimination of hazards the reduction of the hazard actuation s likelihood and then in confining its consequences in this paper four nautical scientists and two deck officers were invited to give opinions to design strategies all of them had rich navigational practices and profound insight for the remotely controlled ship their demographic information is listed in table 6 from the description of table 5 the kinetic energy of the ship in motion is always existing that cannot be eliminated in a remotely controlled ship human still maintain important influence on system safety in some ways as long as there are human driven decisions the human error is inevitable ramos et al 2020 gil et al 2019 galieriková 2019 wrong or inadequate data on environmental sensors would cause operators of scc become blind and create wrong situation awareness who will not be capable of performing the decision process safely and efficiently however the mechanical properties of sensors mean that the exist with a certain probability towards sensor failures inaccuracies in sensor operation or measurement sensor errors or misbehaviors degradation the corresponding elimination strategies are difficult to be generated from the perspective of system safety the loss is almost always fixed and unchangeable when a hazard is created thus in this step the formulation of mitigation strategies mts were discussed towards im and t t the results were presented as follows mt 1 im uca 3 1saf enhancement of situation awareness and operational trainings mt 2 im uca 3 1saf deepen the understanding of ordinary practice of seaman and good seamanship through regular testing and evaluating of procedures mt 3 im uca 3 1saf implementation of rigorous decision making process and generation of contingency

uca 3 composing emergency response plans for ship ship collision accidents mt 4 t t uca 3 using green energy as fuel for ships 5 discussion nowadays the concepts of the autonomous ship are still in an early development phase even though it may be introduced into the public horizon as the remote control mode within the foreseeable future the previous research kavallieratos et al 2019 sen 2016 sahay et al 2019 revealed that the threat of cyber attacks in the maritime domain is real the constant connection between the ship and cyberspace triggers multiple threats that are able to harm the safety and security of maritime industry especially for autonomous shipping the low awareness of maritime sector regarding cyber security means that the cyber attacks could be devastating as these challenges are gradually revealed the designers of future autonomous ocean going vessels devote themselves to incorporate safety and security into the system s design hazards must be designed out eliminated or mitigated for smoothing the introduction of autonomous ships a novel safety and security co analysis methodology based on stpa was proposed that is stpa synss based on the analysis in the previous section the feasibility and the effectiveness of stpa synss were verified which shows stpa synss can be used to weigh complex decisions with regards to critical components and elimination mitigation strategies the results of case study contain similar format output with the existing research conclusions uddin and awal 2020 utne et al 2020 sultana et al 2019 valdez banda et al 2019 the proposed method elevates the security and safety to equal priority which considering the impact of security on system safety from a high level strategic rather than a tactical perspective the generation of loss scenarios was extended into the security domain which was distinguished into two different categories inadvertent scenarios and intentional scenarios importantly the generation of loss scenarios is not the final outputs in stpa synss the contribution obviously distinct from the traditional stpa which rather scarce or limited research focused on mitigation strategies yuan 2019 wróbel et al 2018a 2018b sahay et al 2019 furthermore compared with using stpa to derive the hazard analysis results of a remotely controlled merchant vessel wróbel et al 2018b the proposed stpa synss can identify more ucas and loss scenarios and the more targeted hazard control strategies can be generated meanwhile a comprehensive process to identifying hazards and revealing causal factors was provided in this novel method hazard elimination mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed loop management of potential hazards can be implemented due to limited space the detail of case study was represented only for ibs and its interactions with the aemc system but the results still show that human s impact on the system safety security such as unintentionally wrong decisions of operators in scc or oow and decisions were tampered maliciously the negative influence of human control would propagate rapidly in the meantime such detachment from real sea conditions may cause the operators of scc to fail to fully grasp the sufficient awareness situation thus the benign organizational environment and the competence of operators meet the requirements of related international conventions are necessary on the other hand technical considerations would be also critical to the safety and security of a remotely controlled ship sufficient reliability of software and hardware is the basic guarantee for ensuring timely and effective decisions and control actions the interaction between system components must cooperate to address a lot of complex and non linear issues nowadays the crew on the conventional vessels and remote controlled vessels with seafarers onboard can execute necessary maintenance repairs and contingency wróbel et al 2018a but the situation is difficult to realize for a remote controlled vessel without seafarers onboard and a fully autonomous vessel the hardware and software must be adequately designed to survive any potential unsafe unsecure interactions failure and attack maliciously lastly it will be necessary to compose a contingency plan and some mitigation strategies to meet the requirements of holistic hazard analysis process which can be a starting point for developing the resilience engineering of autonomous ships the application of stpa synss shows that it can help to view the system holistically the mutual relationships between its components of a different nature were systematized effectively however stpa synss does not directly provide quantifiable results because it focuses on hazard identification generation of loss scenarios and outputs of elimination mitigation strategies instead of executing risk assessment the modern systems rely increasingly on software systems and are further embedded in socio technical environments the potential software bugs and non technical impacts are hardly measured at the development phase lacked empirical data in future applicable probability and severity evaluation tools can be used in step 5 to set up a bridge between hazard analysis and risk assessment since the designed structure and concrete system components of a remote controlled ship are still being discussed the results of the study must inevitably be very general all control loops and actions should be detailed as more information is available including specific network architecture further the skill degradation and component degradation shall trigger the negative effects on system performance safety and security these potential degradation over time must be constantly counteracted in which the mitigation strategies can be formulated in a more comprehensive view 6 conclusions in this paper the complete hazard analysis process was applied in the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard under the conceptual framework of autonomous ships it is a highly integrated ship of various systems who needs to meet the dually crucial system properties namely safety and security the aim of this work was to apply the system theoretic approach to improve the safety and security performance of autonomous ships when encountering ship ship collision accidents and related security incidents by generating inadvertent intentional causal factors and developing elimination mitigation strategies the very goal of our research has been accomplished the integration requirement of crucial system properties motivates new methods to analyze holistically systems this paper proposed a novel stpa based methodology that synthesizes safety and security that is stpa synss from the system perspective the method effectively addresses identified limitations of existing stpa based methodology and implements the full hazard analysis process which is composed of 6 steps to execute hazard identification hazard evaluation and hazard control the results show that the developers of autonomous ships still need to concentrate their effort on the human oriented organizational environment resilience based system design and abnormal activity respond mechanisms the stakeholders must invest in resources and capabilities to robust cyber architecture withstand cyber attacks and to guard against potential threats all future work with stpa synss considering similar control actions even in other process industry applications shall be helped to execute hazard identification and design appropriate mitigation strategies credit authorship contribution statement xiang yu zhou conceptualization

21057,the autonomous ship carrying valuable cargoes and passengers in a more effective and cost saving manner will soon be state of the art technology which most likely shall be introduced into the public horizon as the remote control mode within the foreseeable future the highly connected intelligent systems though come at the cost of the increased system vulnerability to cyber attacks to smooth this innovative system can be released into actual context of operation a novel stpa based methodology is proposed that synthesizes safety and security namely stpa synss in the novel method a comprehensive process to identifying hazards and revealing causal factors is provided hazard elimination mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed loop managed the insight regards the operations of the method was demonstrated in a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard the analysis process focused on encountering ship ship collision accidents and related security incidents results indicate that generated inadvertent intentional causal factors and developed elimination mitigation strategies can assist the processes of design and operational planning of the autonomous ships and its shore control centre further the proposed method of this paper also has general relevance for other intelligent systems keywords autonomous ships stpa system safety cyber security hazard analysis safety of maritime transportation 1 introduction innovation nowadays has been affecting manufacturing processes business development and corporate management the emergence of the internet of things and cloud computing technologies has marked the new era of industry 4 0 improvements in information and communication technologies and enhancement in analytical capabilities have created revolutionary developing opportunities in various industry sectors not surprisingly ship intelligence becomes an inevitable trend after ship automation in the development of the shipping industry however the current advanced technology and some intelligent tools do not fundamentally reduce the number of maritime accidents in the complex marine environment human factors still have been identified as the main cause of such accidents even if ships need experienced seafarers to achieve safe driving based on such background the concept of autonomous ship begins to step in popular consciousness in 2012 and 2015 the funding of the maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks munin project by the european union burmeister et al 2014 and rolls royce led advanced autonomous waterborne applications initiative aawa jalonen et al 2016 to outline the concept of autonomous ships and the vision of turning remote and autonomous shipping into a reality in march 2018 international maritime organization imo takes first steps to address autonomous ships and has commenced work to investigate safe secure and environmental friendly maritime autonomous surface ships mass operations in imo instruments msc 100 2018 prior to this imo has already begun to encourage the member states and international organizations to submit substantive proposals and comments on autonomous ships to maritime safety committee msc 99 msc 98 2017a msc 98 2017b at the same time many international organizations have also taken actions to strengthen the cooperation between users researchers authorities and others community who has interested in autonomous ships and their use which promotes the development of autonomous ships the results of such projects were encouraging one remarkable outcome is proposing the concepts and models attempting to evaluate the safety of autonomous maritime navigation wróbel et al 2018a aro and heiskari 2017 allal et al 2017 and related international maritime law issues karlis 2018 chwedczuk 2016 carey 2017 in general autonomous ships have received significant attention from the academic community and industry in recent years which have become a popular research topic as the initiatives to develop and implement autonomous ships into the global shipping industry are gaining momentum their safety remains in the spotlight it is argued that every effort shall be taken to ensure that autonomous ships at least do not undermine the current level of safety besides technical considerations and social controversies safety became the most important issue to resolve the conclusion of the above is that the occurrence of navigational accidents can be expected to decrease with the development of autonomous ships wróbel et al 2017 but more real time data is required and some issues still require addressing in order to reduce the uncertainties the traditional hazard identification approaches to safety such as hazard and operability analysis hazop failure mode and effect analysis fmea event tree analysis eta and fault tree analysis fta were developed for systems that were built more than 50 years these reliability and probability based approaches to safety analysis as applied in afore mentioned research is neither exhaustive nor free of significant drawbacks but as the complexity of system increases traditional bottom up or top down safety assessment tools become insufficient to assure the product safeness stringfellow et al 2010 such hazard analysis tools can only be performed for systems reliability structure of which is known for autonomous ships their concepts of design are still being developed and the final structure of the system remains uncertain therefore it is difficult to explore all the possible scenarios that may arise from the combination of the components behavior and to assess system safety in the reliability based form wróbel et al 2018b furthermore a large amount of system understanding and data for analysis comes from real accidents or case studies hence the traditional methods are not applicable to identify hazards of autonomous ships which focus to address failures based on accidents data driven and chain of events related to component malfunction zhou et al 2020a recently a new hazard analysis tool system theoretic process analysis stpa has emerged as an approach for improving the safety of modern complex systems leveson 2011 rooted in system theoretic accident model and process stamp leveson 2002 it has been widely applied in some engineering domains aps et al 2015 meng et al 2018 abdulkhaleq et al 2015 2017 williams 2015 salmon et al 2018 the above researches indicate the effectiveness of stamp stpa in the evaluation of modern complex and highly automated system safety which can better provide safety constraints to help mitigate those hazards some maritime related research applied stpa began to fade into spotlight in these two years aps et al 2017 zou 2018 rokseth et al 2017 valdez banda and goerlandt 2018 uddin and awal 2020 sultana et al 2019 and better to illuminate the prevailing causal factors not least the systemic ones especially wróbel et al first applied stpa to develop a suitable safety analysis model for autonomous merchant vessels wróbel et al 2018a and remotely controlled merchant vessels wróbel et al 2018b which identify the most likely safety control structure of the analyzed system and assess the impact of potential uncertainties to some extent wróbel s project and his contribution bridges a gap between the safety analysis based on a systemic approach and autonomous merchant vessels and provide an effective suggestion for future designers at the same time the most important is that the research results prove the effectiveness of stpa to access safety and identify hazards of autonomous ships sequentially solberg 2018 and zou 2018 applied stpa to a prototype of a fully autonomous ship called revolt solberg 2018 suggested improvements to this prototype based on the outputted results of hazard analysis and zou 2018 compared stpa with functional fmea and computer hazop valdez banda et al 2019 applied stpa in the initial design process of autonomous ships analyzed in detail the potential hazards of two urban autonomous ferry ships in turku finland and constructed the initial safety management strategy for guiding the design construction and operation of autonomous ships ventikos et al 2020 elaborated the significant contribution of stpa in ensuring the safety of autonomous ships and used stpa to execute the hazard analysis on an autonomous ship with multiple levels of autonomy the results indicate that the number of violated safety constraints is reduced but the mitigative control actions become less feasible with increasing autonomy additionally there is an increasing number of concerns with respect to the ship systems vulnerability to cyber attacks in the maritime industry imo 2020 fitton et al 2015 some studies aimed at trying to identify different attack scenarios on a cargo ship proposing some novel cyber risk assessment approaches tam and jones 2018 2019 kavallieratos et al 2019 and mitigation framework for improved resilience sahay et al 2018 autonomous ships are complex safety critical cyber physical systems cps of which safety and security are two crucial properties it is imperative to identity inter dependencies between safety and security for thoroughly assessing and managing potential risks therefore a combined safety and security co analysis of autonomous ships is being needed in this paper a novel safety and security co analysis methodology based on stpa was proposed and the feasibility of applying on hazard analysis of autonomous ships was explored the proposed method synthesizes safety analysis and security analysis into one concise framework comparing with existing works it introduces 6 improvements and provides a comprehensive process to identify hazards and reveal causal factors so as to achieve continuous tracking and closed loop management of potential system hazards furthermore the key question facing of preventing system losses is focused on system design that may cause system vulnerability and unacceptable losses meanwhile the new way of synthetic analysis is used to address the interdependencies of safety and security which to reduce the number of possible iterations that may be incurred by the requirement conflicts between safety and security in parallel approaches the results of analysis can be used by various stakeholders and provide important data for the design of autonomous ships operation 2 the concept of autonomous ships as the improvement of the automatic level of the ship smart ships have entered people s field of vision the smart ship is the highest level of automation not only with fully automated fixed mode automation but also intelligent decision making and judgment compared with conventional ships autonomous ships will be a highly integrated ship of various systems which is the advanced stage of smart ship development in general automated ships smart ships and autonomous ships are continuums of technological development in the navigation domain the differences between them are mainly reflected in the operation means there is little difference in the execution process results and operational instructions zhou et al 2019a however the overall design structure of autonomous ships shall be obviously different from nowadays conventional ships including bridge structure setting hull design propulsion system and energy management especially nearly all subsystems of autonomous ships will be controlled by remote or autonomous mode including collision avoidance decision making and ship state monitoring the vessel may be manned with a reduced crew or unmanned with or without supervision and have the capabilities to make decisions and perform actions with or without human in the loop to a varying degree it can operate independently from human interaction it is worth noting that the concept of autonomous ships is different from that of unmanned ships unmanned ships are only an important stage in the development of autonomous ships and they are the manifestations of autonomous ships reaching a high level of autonomy at present there are more than six international authorities have published their versions of levels of autonomy for ships zhou et al 2019a including lloyd s register norwegian forum for autonomous ships danish maritime authority maritime autonomous systems regulatory working group bureau veritas and imo among them the version of lloyd s register is the first representative document in global which divided levels of autonomy for ships into seven degrees namely al0 al6 lloyd s register 2016 furthermore imo imo 2018 adopted the taxonomy of autonomy levels was proposed by danish maritime authority in this paper the version described by imo was adopted which is shown as follows ship with automated processes and decision support m seafarers are on board to operate and control shipboard systems and functions some operations may be automated remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board r the ship is controlled and operated from another location but seafarers are on board remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board ru the ship is controlled and operated from another location there are no seafarers on board fully autonomous ship a the operating system of the ship is able to make decisions and determine actions by itself in this paper we focus on the remote control mode supported by shore control centre scc that corresponds to level r and ru in imo s description as shown in fig 1 according to the general opinion of technicians level r is a practical solution within the achievable range and level ru is the next achievement goal in unmanned navigation primary phase it s worth noting that most projects on autonomous ships are conditional upon the ships having been designed which need to be operated in the various autonomy of level for the duration of a single voyage given an example an autonomous ship will be operated via manual steering or remote control in densely trafficked areas whereas the ship will switch over to level a in open sea here autonomous ship is not necessarily autonomous the vessel traversing different seas will be monitored supervised and authorized by few operators onboard or scc receiving crucial information via satellite porathe et al 2014 in the upcoming of remote controlled navigation the task can be divided into three basic categories berth to berth including autonomous docking pilot point to pilot point navigation in open sea or deep water in these categories berth to berth mode has the highest requirement while the lowest in open sea mode the collecting processing and transmitting data from sensors onboard was transfer to scc shore based team analysis them to provide decision support to a unified bridge for remote controlled ships and to effective autonomous collision avoidance system kobyliński 2018 since scc is quite far from the ship itself there is no bodily feeling of the ship rocking and the look outside even if communicated via camera feeds could provide an only limited understanding of the conditions yemao et al 2014 the setting and interaction between scc and autonomous ships porathe et al 2014 may be potentially create further issues including limited situation awareness due to reduced sense of the ship information overload due to the plurality of ships and ship sensors and communication challenges due to limited knowledge on the local conditions or language issues wahlström et al 2015 furthermore such massive data transmission and interaction rely on digital communication between ships and between ship and shore and these connections are possible entry points to interfere with the ship s operation and result in threats rødseth and lee 2015 the potential hazards must be identified to ensure the safety and security of autonomous navigation in fact compared with manual navigation m level the remote control mode of autonomous ships will affect virtually all aspects of her operation especially for navigation all functions and potential hazards are mutually related and it is difficult to evaluate components individually meanwhile the new autonomy concept though comes at the cost of the increased system vulnerability to cyber attacks which may lead to unavailability or hazardous behavior of the critical ship systems although systematic hazard identification has been used to find critical safety hazards and how to address these for unmanned merchant ship rødseth and burmeister 2015 no existing approach can comprehensively assess the safety and security hazard associated with autonomous ships due to the novel combinations of sophisticated autonomy technologies and traditional maritime systems therefore an effective method aimed at safety and security co analysis of autonomous ships can execute the hazard analysis process to enhance the safety and security of the ship systems design 3 methods complexity in autonomous systems reaching a new level and the majority of hazard analysis methods currently based on the assumption becoming less effective role of humans in systems is changing so we need a paradigm change to deal with safety in modern systems from the focus on component reliability to systems thinking 3 1 review of stpa and its extensions in stamp safety is treated as a dynamic control problem rather than failure prevention or a reliability problem which expands the traditional model of causality beyond a chain of directly related failure events or component failures to include more complex processes and unsafe interactions among system components stpa is a proactive analysis method and stamp based tool applied during system development the goal of stpa is to develop causal accident scenarios that encompass the entire accident process and not just component level failures and events and their effect on the system operation later stpa sec was proposed as an extension of stpa that considered security young and leveson 2013 2014 which identifies and enforces required constraints on unsecure control actions that place the system in vulnerable states when subjected to disturbances stpa sec has raised the attention of securing the system from a different perspective which aims to ensure the critical functions and maintain the service provision in the face of disruption meanwhile the method motivated relevant studies such as stpa safesec friedberg et al 2017 stpa priv shapiro 2016 systems theoretic likelihood and severity analysis stlsa temple et al 2017 and some improvement of stpa stpa sec for safety and security co analysis schmittner et al 2016 erik nilsen et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 although the authors of the above studies are aware of the safety and security are intertwined in the safety critical system which needs to be considered simultaneously the primary goal of an integrated safety and security analysis has not been achieved stpa sec as a security oriented derivative of stpa argues that security is only relevant with respect to its impact on safety this is a limited view of the system perspective the guidance for the integration of safety and security into a unified analysis process equally the identification of intentional causal scenarios and how to perform the security analysis was not provided stpa safesec aims to address the above mentioned shortcomings and improve the capability of stpa stpa sec which deeply integrates safety and security it extends and refines the core modeling technique of stpa including extends the safety focused causal factor guidance into the security domain links the abstract control structure to the physical system design introduces lists of general integrity threats and general availability threats stpa safesec appears most promising due to its recognition of the need for deep integration between system safety and security however the technique does not address stpa s need for increased rigor in analysis the derived temporary terminology lists and guidewords lack the theoretical grounding there is no discussion of the development path of identified threats and how the hazards were evaluated to generate potential mitigation strategies additionally the effectiveness analysis of these presented mitigation strategies has not been proceeded autonomous ships are dependent on the extensive use of digital and communications technologies throughout their operational life which the decision making process would be highly affected by digital information that is collected along a voyage and transmitted to shore increased interconnectivity between ships personal devices and on shore infrastructure has improved operational efficiency and physical safety but it also enables an increase of cyber attacks currently cyber security has been starting to be a high priority for the maritime industry disruption of network and information systems operations can lead to financial and environmental damage or even endanger human safety therefore security and safety should be considered as equally important properties that affect each other there are integrated approach and unified approach are identified regarding as the co analysis of safety and security an integrated approach analyzes safety and security separately and then integrates the results while a unified approach analyzes safety and security jointly lisova et al 2019 the former reduces the insight of the analysis leading to unbalanced results while the latter provides more rigorous results with better understanding of potential conflicts between safety and security despite the diversity most of the existing works on the joint analysis of safety and security tackle security only as a peripheral or constituent of safety largely neglecting the intertwining between safety and security in the safety critical system simultaneously none of the previous studies conducted the safety and security co analysis processes aimed at autonomous ships especially the suitable co analysis methods have not been proposed to smooth the introduction of autonomous ships and ensure the safety security of maritime transportation the new way of joint safety and security analyses that treat their interdependencies is needed which to reduce the number of possible iterations that may be incurred by the requirement conflicts between safety and security in parallel approaches 3 2 the proposed method system safety is the formal process of identifying and controlling mishap risk the hazard analysis provides the basic foundation for system safety which is performed to identify hazards hazard effects and hazard causal factors ericson 2015 the analysis process focuses on recognizing hazards that may arise from a system or its environment documenting their unwanted consequences and analyzing their potential causes this is a process whereby safety is achieved through the identification of hazards the evaluation of hazards and the control of hazards presenting unacceptable risk in general safety and security were treated as different system properties security related causes can lead to safety related losses and safety related causes can lead to security related losses accordingly however safety is regarded as preventing inadvertent losses by benevolent actors while security is regarded as preventing deliberate losses by malicious actors it can be argued that there is little distinction between safety and security other than the intentions of the actors both of them are ultimately focused on the high level goal of preventing losses from the perspective of system engineering in order to make the entire socio technical system as a whole in achieving security and safety it should not be overly constrained to low level hardware or operator behavior but should use more efficient and resolve potential conflicts between safety and security early in the development process of system currently security and safety both attempt to prevent losses in complex software controlled systems central to stpa is to identify the unacceptable consequences in this paper a novel stpa based methodology was proposed that synthesizes safety and security stpa synss to execute the full hazard analysis process hazard analysis process is a formal process which includes hazard identification hazard evaluation and hazard control as depicted in fig 2 on the basis of identifying hazard effects and hazard causal factors the proposed stpa synss can be used to determine the significance of hazards and to establish design measures that will eliminate or mitigate the identified hazards as a continuing closed loop iterative process stpa synss can effectively tracked potential hazards until acceptable closure action is implemented and verified furthermore cyber security is considered as a strategic issue but not a tactic issue stpa synss focuses on how to control system vulnerabilities rather than how to avoid threats the reframing of co analysis method shifts security analysis from guarding against attack to broader system design it can prevent not only system losses from know threats but also system losses introduced by unknown threats such as malicious insiders the workflow of stpa synss is given in fig 3 the aim of the proposed method is to address the above mentioned identified limitations of existing alternatives and introduces the following improvements 1 stpa synss frame the full stpa based hazard analysis process and elevate the security and safety to equal priority hazard elimination mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed loop management of potential hazards can be implemented 2 considering the impact of security on system safety from a high level strategic rather than a tactical perspective the key question facing of preventing security related losses was focused on the unrequested design that creates system vulnerability the method prevents not only disruptions from known threats but also disruptions introduced by unknown threats such as malicious insiders 3 the security concerns of non traditional stakeholders that is security related losses were included in the unacceptable losses further the definition of the term accident and loss was distinguished that an accident incident can lead to one or more losses to fill the gap between the generic losses and further analysis the inter step of identifying the safety accidents and the security incidents are integrated into the analysis process 4 to overcome the limitation of prior knowledge required to build the functional control structure the functional requirements derived from safety security constraints were introduced and the model elements and their responsibility were identified at the desired abstraction level which to facilitate the development of control structures 5 generating the mapping between the abstract control loops and the physical components to refine the constraints and derive more specific causal factors which shows the visualization of identified model elements and their responsibilities meanwhile refined safety security constraints can be mapped to the physical components so that provide guidance for the description of hazard components 6 the generation of loss scenarios was extended into the security domain which intended as a starting point for further thoughts and the investigation of the intended and malicious activation of unsecure control actions the identification of loss scenarios was distinguished into two different categories inadvertent scenarios and intentional scenarios the stpa synss can be used at any stage of the system life cycle the aim of analysis is to determine how the behavioral safety security constraints which are derived from system hazards can be violated and how to prevent such violations the ultimate goal is to design elimination or mitigation strategies based on generated loss scenarios and evaluated hazard components summarily the workflow of proposed method executed in following steps step 1 define purpose of the analysis in the first place the methodology begins by defining the scope of the analysis the system boundaries need to be explicitly defined and the system goals need to be described secondly the unacceptable losses accidents incident need to be defined accidents or incidents are possibly identified from mission scenarios which can provide a more comprehensive understanding than generally unacceptable losses especially the improvement can be linked to defined unacceptable losses and provide a structured and concrete link to further analysis the next sub step is to define the system level hazards by identifying system states or conditions that will lead to a loss in worst case environmental conditions to avoid the ambiguity for safety and security co analysis the following safety oriented and security oriented terms would be adopted to establish a common understanding the resulting terminologies were shown in table 1 if appropriate these identified system level hazards can be refined into sub hazards to facilitate more in depth understanding of system level hazards and support the construction of the hierarchical control structure moreover once the system level hazards are identified it is straightforward to identify system level constraints that must be enforced step 2 model the control structure finally the functional requirements derived from safety security constraints are proposed as an intermediate step to link the system level constraints and the control structure this introduction converts the abstractive system constraints into concrete requirements and is used to refine the properties that the control loop should have importantly the functional requirements are an effective addition to facilitate the development of the control structure especially for innovative system lacked prior knowledge this step identifies the model elements and their responsibilities including controller s controlled process es actuator s and sensor s the control action derived from the responsibilities would enforce constraints on the behavior of the controlled process the defined responsibilities and the functional requirements derived from high level safety security constraints can be used to bridge the gap between the hierarchical control structure and identified system level hazards in this step the focus of the hierarchical control structure is functional relationships and functional interactions rather than typically capture purely physical or geometric relationships step 3 identify the unsafe unsecure control actions once the control structure has been modeled the next step is to identify ucas to provide adequate control the controller must have an accurate model of the process usually there are the inconsistencies between the process model used by the controller and the actual process state which will lead to accidents especially in a complex system herein the control actions and process model variables would be captured to completed the step process model variables are measurable indicators of the conditions that trigger a control action to keep the safety of a system it can be used for establishing the context for ucas causal factors and scenarios the control actions are actions necessary for each element to execute their responsibilities which can be distinguished with the following four potential ways of inadequate control leveson 2011 1 not providing the control action leads to a hazard 2 providing the control action leads to a hazard 3 providing a potentially safe control action but too early too late or in the wrong order 4 the control action lasts too long or is stopped too soon for continuous control actions not discrete ones step 4 generate loss scenarios in this step the violations of safety security constraints or how they can occur would be identified which describes the causal factors that can lead to ucas and to hazards the loss scenarios should be considered in the following factors as shown in fig 4 including controller related actuator related sensor related controlled process related reasons and their interactions the mapping between control loop and physical components are introduced in stpa synss which shows the running of interactions in physical components furthermore these potential causal scenarios were considered into two different ways to implement safety and security co analysis process inadvertent acts and intentional acts the generation of component level safety security constraints need to rely on the above results step 5 describe and evaluate hazard components the step is the second phase of the hazard analysis that is hazard evaluation the hazard is an entity containing only the necessary and sufficient elements that caused a safety accident or security incident which defines the necessary conditions for an accident incident and the end outcome or effect of the accident incident three necessary and coupled components consists the hazard triangle including hazardous element he initiating mechanism im target and threat t t as illustrated in fig 5 based on the results of hazard identification step 1 4 the hazard components need to be described and evaluated which is regarded as the input of designing elimination or mitigation strategies however significantly the precise probabilities of system transitioning to an unsafe unsecure state were given that is very challenging bjerga et al 2016 particularly in initial phases of system development due to lack of historical data and sufficiently accurate models wróbel et al 2018a leveson 2011 step 6 design elimination or mitigation strategies accidents incidents are the immediate result of actualized hazards the hazard transitions from a conditional state to an accident state when the components within the hazard are in a specific alignment the actuation process also was shown in fig 5 the hazard analysis process is a formal process of intentionally designing in safety by designing out hazards hazard identification and elimination mitigation is the key to this process as shown in fig 5 the necessary condition for hazard to exist is that all three sides of the triangle must be present remove any one of the triangle sides can result in the hazard is eliminated when hazard elimination is not possible the next objective is to reduce the probability of the accident incident and or the severity of the accident incident the potential elimination or mitigation strategies were presented in fig 6 4 results in this section the proposed method was applied to the r level of autonomous ship that is the remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board the intention is to enhance the safe navigation and manoeuvering of autonomous ships and demonstrate how a full hazard analysis process can be accomplished for the system now there is a consensus that the shift towards autonomous ships will most likely follow the gradual transition from lower to higher levels of autonomy rather than an instant change from the manned ship to unmanned ship zhou et al 2019b fan et al 2020 coping with the strong needs of the shipping industry for digital transformation the remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board that is r mode is regarded as the most likely to be introduced within the foreseeable future therefore this case study only concentrates on the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard considering the limited space the ru mode will be discussed in future work according to the annual overview report published by the european maritime safety agency emas 426 accidents resulted in a total of 696 lives lost from 2011 to 2018 emsa 2019 as depicted in fig 7 in the last eight years navigational casualties represent more than 54 4 of all casualty events where vessel was involved with collisions 26 2 contacts 15 3 and grounding stranding 12 9 the collision is the main type of maritime accidents where fatalities occurred despite the fact that the overall design structure of autonomous ships shall be obviously different from nowadays conventional ships but the concept of former is still an extension of the latter meanwhile in our previous research zhou et al 2020b the potential conflicts and barriers have been identified when applying the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea 1972 colregs to autonomous ships which can build up an effective basis for this study therefore in this case study the safety and security co analysis would be executed for the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard focused on collision avoidance 4 1 define purpose of the analysis step 1 at the beginning of the analysis the purpose needs to be described including the system boundary and goal in this case the system boundary covers the operation of a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard the goal of analysis is to support the introduction of autonomous ships while minimizing collision risk maintaining profitable operations afterwards the unaccepted losses relevant to this phase are defined as follows l 1 loss of life or serious injury to people l 2 loss or damage to the ship or objects outside the ship l 3 loss of transportation mission l 4 loss of confidentiality integrity and availability of the mission data l 5 environmental loss l 6 loss of feasibility for the introduction of autonomous ships according to the goal of analysis accident and incident were identified by enumerating concrete mission scenarios and linked to their corresponding losses a 1 the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard collides with other ships l 1 l 2 l 3 l 5 l 6 i 1 unauthorized access to confidential information l 4 l 6 herein i 1 may cause the occurrence of a 1 but i 1 is the individual incident also can result in other system losses including once the system boundary and goal are identified the next step is to define the system level hazards system level safety security constraints sc and functional requirements fr accordingly h 1 the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard violates minimum safe distance of approach that should be maintained from other ships during their encountering a 1 sc 1 the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard must maintain minimum safe distance of approach from other ships during their encountering h 1 fr 1 1 the minimum safe distance of approach that should be maintained between remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard and other ships must be known during their encountering fr 1 2 the actual distance between remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard and other ships must be able to know in real time during their encountering fr 1 3 the actual distance between remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard and other ships must be able to control in real time during their encountering h 2 confidential information is accessed by unauthorized entity or person i 1 sc 2 confidential information must not be accessed by unauthorized entity or person fr 2 the access to confidential information must be authorized 4 2 model the control structure step 2 in this step it is required to model a hierarchical safety control structure based on the responsibilities of all the model elements and functional requirements up to now the design concepts of the remotely controlled ship are still being developed and the final structure of the system remains uncertain however many positive attempts deserve to be referred burmeister et al 2014 wróbel et al 2018b bolbot et al 2020 lagouvardou 2018 abilio ramos et al 2019 heikkilä et al 2020 utne et al 2020 ramos et al 2020 valdez banda et al 2019 kavallieratos et al 2020 zou 2018 zhou et al 2019a gil et al 2019 solberg 2018 and available drawings for similar ships was introduced in addition the brainstorming workshop was organized to discuss the necessary model elements with experts including engineers of ship design institute nautical scientists researchers focused on autonomous ships the functional control structure of a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard during the voyage is given in fig 8 scc is a generally accepted terminology for the facility controlling or supervising autonomous ship zhou et al 2020a in this functional control structure the main responsibility of scc is to control the ship supervise the voyage and initiate a fallback strategy in an emergency during the voyage shore ship reliable and precise communication is one of the most vital to remotely controlled vessel s safety security hence scc will use the dedicated secure satellite communication link to transmit the necessary data with the remotely controlled ship the communication controller is responsible for controlling over information flow and ensuring the security communications are readily available based on the declaration of imo autonomous ships may switch between various operational modes with different levels of autonomy due to rapidly changing environment or complex nature of tasks for a remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard one or a few persons trained for navigational watch and manoeuvring of the ship will be on standby at manual control station onboard who ready to receive control assume the navigational watch and communicate with other ships via very high frequency vhf only when necessary or in an emergency in this context the operation mode consists of three categories including scc control mode autonomous operation mode and manual control mode the scc control mode is a general mode herein scc possesses full control for ships the decision making and action taking all are done by operators of scc however the autonomous operation mode can be activated when the ship is performing some predefined plans or low complexity tasks for example sailing in open sea with good weather and sea conditions at this moment the decisions and actions are performed autonomously with human supervision and authorization including the operator of scc and officer of the watch oow at manual control station onboard meanwhile they have the right to intervene high impact decisions once the external environment changes the autonomous operation mode can be switched back to scc control mode at any time furthermore scc can request oow to receive the control of ship in necessary or emergency that is the manual control mode which is to ensure the navigation safety such as the communication between scc and ship is unexpectedly interrupted in this case the level of autonomy will be shifted to level m under normal considerations the remotely controlled ship is operated by operators of scc or execute autonomous navigation in predefined plan and operational envelope without human intervention the autonomous navigational functions are conducted by the autonomous navigation system ans with the help of the advanced environmental sensor module according to the setting procedure ans is basically only active in the autonomous operation mode it consists of two separate sub systems including route planning and collision avoidance the route planning module can optimize the anticipatory voyage plan based on the ship s hydrodynamics with regard to fuel efficiency for a given weather forecast while collision avoidance algorithm works with a formalized description of colregs to calculate colregs compliant deviation measures for a given traffic situation to meet the functional safety requirements of remotely controlled ships the environmental sensor module needs to include global navigation satellite systems gnss automatic identification system ais electronic chart display information system ecdis global maritime distress and safety system gmdss light detection and ranging lidar laser detection and ranging ladar high definition cameras with infrared capability radar with automatic radar plotting aid arpa gyrocompass log and echosounder data fed by environmental sensor module is used to provide situation awareness to operators of scc and provide the ans with a perception of the vicinity of the ship including own ship s navigational states environmental conditions target data for detected obstacles as well as real time tracking data the autonomous engine monitoring and control aemc system consists of propulsion and steering subsystem auxiliary engines and other auxiliary machinery which is responsible for controlling the ship s speed and course according to commands from scc manual control station or ans and receiving all observed measuring values of the engine room including rudder angle main engine revolutions fuel consumption combustion temperature engine temperature generator voltage and frequency control generator load in kw and etc furthermore aemc system can identify potential errors before they result in a malfunction and determine effective countermeasures including ans all feedback and information will be integrated in integrated bridge system ibs to implement configurations and reconfigurations which helps oow onboard and operators of scc monitor the effectiveness of actions taken importantly all of them need to be loaded and saved into voyage data recorder vdr 4 3 identify the unsafe unsecure control actions step 3 herein 17 control actions and 14 feedbacks were identified in the interest of saving space the details of the intermediate steps of the method are presented only for ibs and its interactions with aemc system in the control loop ibs as a controller while aemc system as the controlled process in this case study we focus mainly on this control loop and proceed by refining the control responsibilities of ibs as 1 receiving commands from scc manual control station or ans and imposing control towards aemc system to adjust course speed of the ship in real time 2 configuring the propulsion and steering system auxiliary engines and other auxiliary machinery to the operating mode in line with the current navigational states via aemc system to ensure sufficient reliability low emissions and sufficient maneuverability 3 configuring the environmental sensor module to an operating mode that conforms to the current navigational states the related control actions and feedbacks are briefly explained in table 2 in this control loop no 3 and no 27 are control inputs from another controller before proceeding to the next step the process model variables for ibs need to be defined which based on an assessment on what ibs needs to know to satisfy the control responsibility in this control loop the following variables can be identified process model variable 1 navigational intentions of other ships during ship ship encountering an assessment of navigational intentions is necessary to determine whether the course control and speed control of the own ship meet the requirement of safety encountering process model variable 2 ship types of other ships during ship ship encountering to make appropriate collision avoidance decisions it is necessary for ibs to know which type of the other ship it is for example if the own ship is a power driven vessel the collision avoidance decision making will be different that depends on the target ship is a power driven vessel sailing vessel fishing vessel vessel not under command vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre or vessel constrained by her draught etc process model variable 3 target ship s navigational states to make appropriate collision avoidance decisions it is necessary for ibs to know to assess the navigational states of the target ship process model variable 4 own ship s navigational states to make appropriate collision avoidance decisions it is necessary for ibs to know to assess the navigational states of the own ship process model variable 5 minimum safe distance of approach to other ships during ship ship encountering necessary to know to assess what is an appropriate minimum safe distance of approach these identified process model variables are used for establishing the context for ucas causal factors and potential loss scenarios meanwhile in this step the ucas of ibs are identified by analyzing the colregs compliance of control actions and the feedback control loops in the control structure that is constructed in the previous step in this case study the situation only is considered where the own ship and the target ship are all power driven vessels the results were presented in table 3 4 4 generate loss scenarios step 4 now that we have identified the ucas cause system hazards which is to identify system flaws that enable hazardous control actions the traditional stpa only focus on the safety domain while the violation of safety constraints and security constraints were considered in the stpa synss in this step the loss scenarios were generated to facilitate deeper insights and understanding which were divided into inadvertent losses and intentional losses during the generation process the control loop will be mapped to physical components that refine the constraints and derive more specific causal factors fig 8 have shown the physical components in environmental sensor module according to the definition of loss scenario the causal factor is critical that derive the description of loss scenario therefore to refine description and facilitate the evaluate hazard components the identified causal factors were presented instead of full loss scenarios in table 4 if necessary it only needs to add the corresponding context of the identified causal factors to generate whole loss scenarios including the controllers that can provide the control actions the context of occurred ucas the link to system level hazards or sub hazards for example the loss scenario of uca 1 1saf can be described that the ownship shall so far as possible take early and substantial action to keep well clear when the ownship is a give way ship only if risk of collision exists but the course speed control cannot be provided due to the physical failures of ibs and its components as a result the ownship may violate minimum safe distance of approach that should be maintained from other ships during their encountering the causal factors in table 4 represent the preliminary results of stpa synss which are prerequisites for the occurrence of the loss scenarios in addition the degradation of systems and components over time would cause negative impacts this consideration will be discussed in our future work for remotely controlled vessels concrete system components are still being discussed such as physical actuators between controller and controlled process it is difficult to implement full mapping to physical components in this paper however the proposed hazard analysis method provides a novel idea to address the issues that component level safety security constraints this work is necessary that will be completed in the following work 4 5 describe and evaluate hazard components step 5 in this step hazard components need to be described and evaluated including he im and t t due to the limited space the description and evaluation will furthermore focus on the uca 3 above according to the definition of hazard components the identified causal factors for ucas are described as im and he can be identified by using hazardous element checklists as shown in table 5 herein the case study was focused on reducing the occurring of collision accident therefore the he and t t are same for different causal factors for uca 3 the t t represents the severity of the accident which can be redirected to the unacceptable losses defined in the initial step of the analysis once the hazard components have been described the next step is to evaluate the probability of im and the severity of t t hazards will always exist but their risk must and can be made under the acceptable scope which the level of risk need to be made by decision authority the evaluation in this step aiming to build the foundation of possible risk assessment however due to the lack of empirical data nowadays it is difficult that calculating the precise probabilities of a system transitioning to an unsafe state especially for the remotely controlled ship nevertheless the design of elimination or mitigation strategies are regarded as being efficient when it comes to accident prevention and damage reduction in the worst case scenario 4 6 design elimination or mitigation strategies step 6 the design process will involve safety driven security driven optimization of the system which aiming primarily at the elimination of hazards the reduction of the hazard actuation s likelihood and then in confining its consequences in this paper four nautical scientists and two deck officers were invited to give opinions to design strategies all of them had rich navigational practices and profound insight for the remotely controlled ship their demographic information is listed in table 6 from the description of table 5 the kinetic energy of the ship in motion is always existing that cannot be eliminated in a remotely controlled ship human still maintain important influence on system safety in some ways as long as there are human driven decisions the human error is inevitable ramos et al 2020 gil et al 2019 galieriková 2019 wrong or inadequate data on environmental sensors would cause operators of scc become blind and create wrong situation awareness who will not be capable of performing the decision process safely and efficiently however the mechanical properties of sensors mean that the exist with a certain probability towards sensor failures inaccuracies in sensor operation or measurement sensor errors or misbehaviors degradation the corresponding elimination strategies are difficult to be generated from the perspective of system safety the loss is almost always fixed and unchangeable when a hazard is created thus in this step the formulation of mitigation strategies mts were discussed towards im and t t the results were presented as follows mt 1 im uca 3 1saf enhancement of situation awareness and operational trainings mt 2 im uca 3 1saf deepen the understanding of ordinary practice of seaman and good seamanship through regular testing and evaluating of procedures mt 3 im uca 3 1saf implementation of rigorous decision making process and generation of contingency

early development phase even though it may be introduced into the public horizon as the remote control mode within the foreseeable future the previous research kavallieratos et al 2019 sen 2016 sahay et al 2019 revealed that the threat of cyber attacks in the maritime domain is real the constant connection between the ship and cyberspace triggers multiple threats that are able to harm the safety and security of maritime industry especially for autonomous shipping the low awareness of maritime sector regarding cyber security means that the cyber attacks could be devastating as these challenges are gradually revealed the designers of future autonomous ocean going vessels devote themselves to incorporate safety and security into the system s design hazards must be designed out eliminated or mitigated for smoothing the introduction of autonomous ships a novel safety and security co analysis methodology based on stpa was proposed that is stpa synss based on the analysis in the previous section the feasibility and the effectiveness of stpa synss were verified which shows stpa synss can be used to weigh complex decisions with regards to critical components and elimination mitigation strategies the results of case study contain similar format output with the existing research conclusions uddin and awal 2020 utne et al 2020 sultana et al 2019 valdez banda et al 2019 the proposed method elevates the security and safety to equal priority which considering the impact of security on system safety from a high level strategic rather than a tactical perspective the generation of loss scenarios was extended into the security domain which was distinguished into two different categories inadvertent scenarios and intentional scenarios importantly the generation of loss scenarios is not the final outputs in stpa synss the contribution obviously distinct from the traditional stpa which rather scarce or limited research focused on mitigation strategies yuan 2019 wróbel et al 2018a 2018b sahay et al 2019 furthermore compared with using stpa to derive the hazard analysis results of a remotely controlled merchant vessel wróbel et al 2018b the proposed stpa synss can identify more ucas and loss scenarios and the more targeted hazard control strategies can be generated meanwhile a comprehensive process to identifying hazards and revealing causal factors was provided in this novel method hazard elimination mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed loop management of potential hazards can be implemented due to limited space the detail of case study was represented only for ibs and its interactions with the aemc system but the results still show that human s impact on the system safety security such as unintentionally wrong decisions of operators in scc or oow and decisions were tampered maliciously the negative influence of human control would propagate rapidly in the meantime such detachment from real sea conditions may cause the operators of scc to fail to fully grasp the sufficient awareness situation thus the benign organizational environment and the competence of operators meet the requirements of related international conventions are necessary on the other hand technical considerations would be also critical to the safety and security of a remotely controlled ship sufficient reliability of software and hardware is the basic guarantee for ensuring timely and effective decisions and control actions the interaction between system components must cooperate to address a lot of complex and non linear issues nowadays the crew on the conventional vessels and remote controlled vessels with seafarers onboard can execute necessary maintenance repairs and contingency wróbel et al 2018a but the situation is difficult to realize for a remote controlled vessel without seafarers onboard and a fully autonomous vessel the hardware and software must be adequately designed to survive any potential unsafe unsecure interactions failure and attack maliciously lastly it will be necessary to compose a contingency plan and some mitigation strategies to meet the requirements of holistic hazard analysis process which can be a starting point for developing the resilience engineering of autonomous ships the application of stpa synss shows that it can help to view the system holistically the mutual relationships between its components of a different nature were systematized effectively however stpa synss does not directly provide quantifiable results because it focuses on hazard identification generation of loss scenarios and outputs of elimination mitigation strategies instead of executing risk assessment the modern systems rely increasingly on software systems and are further embedded in socio technical environments the potential software bugs and non technical impacts are hardly measured at the development phase lacked empirical data in future applicable probability and severity evaluation tools can be used in step 5 to set up a bridge between hazard analysis and risk assessment since the designed structure and concrete system components of a remote controlled ship are still being discussed the results of the study must inevitably be very general all control loops and actions should be detailed as more information is available including specific network architecture further the skill degradation and component degradation shall trigger the negative effects on system performance safety and security these potential degradation over time must be constantly counteracted in which the mitigation strategies can be formulated in a more comprehensive view 6 conclusions in this paper the complete hazard analysis process was applied in the remotely controlled ship with seafarers onboard under the conceptual framework of autonomous ships it is a highly integrated ship of various systems who needs to meet the dually crucial system properties namely safety and security the aim of this work was to apply the system theoretic approach to improve the safety and security performance of autonomous ships when encountering ship ship collision accidents and related security incidents by generating inadvertent intentional causal factors and developing elimination mitigation strategies the very goal of our research has been accomplished the integration requirement of crucial system properties motivates new methods to analyze holistically systems this paper proposed a novel stpa

21058,the acoustic wave propagating in ocean is severely distorted due to the sound speed profile of sea water and the reflection and absorption of seabed the fem bem is a preferable method to solve the fluid structure interactive vibration and sound radiation problem of underwater structure in ocean acoustic environment since the green function can be applied in the integral equation the simple source integral method is more preferable compared with helmholtz integral because the calculation of normal derivative of green function is avoided in order to remove the irregular frequency problem zhou zhou et al 2010 proposed a cvis theory which however introduced the normal derivative of green function on cvis surface and limited its application into ocean acoustical environment therefore an equivalent source formulation of cvis is proposed based on the definition of normal derivative so that the normal derivative of green function on the integration of cvis is replaced the radiated spl of spherical shell is calculated in shallow and deep sea with various sound speed profiles it is shown that the equivalent source cvis can be used to eliminate the irregular frequency problem of the far field radiated sound pressure of underwater elastic structure in ocean acoustic environment keywords sound speed gradient simple source integral irregular frequency acoustic radiation sound propagation 1 introduction 1the calculation of vibroacoustic properties of shell structure is of significant engineering meaning huang et al 2020 zarastvand et al 1007 on the prediction of underwater fluid structure interactive vibration and acoustic radiation of complicated structure the coupled fem bem is a prevailing algorithm because the green function can be chosen according to the characteristics of acoustical environment wu et al 2016 the integral function on the wetted surface can be of a simple source formulation zhou and joseph 2005 1 ϕ r s g r r 0 σ r 0 d s in which g r r 0 is the sound field green function between source r 0 and receiving spot r and σ is the distributed source strength on wetted surface ϕ is the radiated velocity potential in the fluid domain another available function is the helmholtz integral function employed by everstine et al everstine and henderson 1990 2 1 2 ϕ r s ϕ r 0 g r r 0 n r 0 g r r 0 ϕ r 0 n r 0 d s in which means to take the normal derivative on wetted surface however at the resonant frequencies of interior fluid domain the solution of simple source integral does not exist while that of helmholtz integral is non unique the so called irregular frequency problem is introduced by boundary element discretization but of no physical existence which is demonstrated by schenck schenck 1967 in order to eliminate the irregular frequency in helmholtz integral schenck schenck 1967 proposed a combined helmholtz integral equation formulation chief method in which several integration spots are added to the interior domain to form an overdetermined equation to be decoupled using lsm however if the added integration spot is just on the nodal surface of the resonant interior fluid domain the spot is invalid although one valid interior spot is enough to remove the irregular frequency the nodal surfaces are more closely spaced and the selection of chief spot will be very difficult seybert and rengarajan 1987 wu and seybert wu and seybert 1991 further proposed a chief block method instead of the chief point so that the invalidation of chief point on nodal surfaces is solved the singular value decomposition method on the coefficient matrix proposed by juhl juhl 1994 and chen chen et al 2009 can be used to predict the number of added interior spots to eliminate the irregular frequency and verify whether the spot is valid according to the coordinate of the spot however for higher acting frequency of structures with complex geometry there is still some difficulty in using chief method the burton miller method burton and miller 1971 is mathematically stricter compared with chief the eigen frequency of helmholtz function and that of the normal derivative of helmholtz function are not identical a coupling coefficient α is used to superpose the two functions to obtain 3 1 2 ϕ r α 2 ϕ r n r s ϕ r 0 g r r 0 n r 0 d s s g r r 0 ϕ r 0 n r 0 d s α s ϕ r 0 2 g r r 0 n r n r 0 d s α s g r r 0 n r ϕ r 0 n r 0 d s to eliminate the irregular frequency in real number domain the coupling coefficient α should be a pure image number it is observed in further research that a better result can be achieved by setting α i k than α i harris and amini 1992 in which i 1 and the wavenumber k 2 π f c on the selection of α marburg marburg 2014 has made a detailed review and compared the iterations required of various α values marburg 2016 the main difficulty of burton miller algorithm is the hypersingular item in eqn 3 which is time consuming in calculation liu liu and chen 1999 and chen chen and jinharris 2009 provided a weak singular form of the hypersingular item in eqn 3 using static green function in infinite acoustic field for the half infinite waters the green function using image method can be applied to the boundary element integral guo et al 2017 the virtual chain green function is required if the influence of seabed sediment absorption should be included zou et al 2014 if the receiving spot is not so far from the structure the seabed reflection coefficient is approximately a constant wu et al 2016 for far field observation spots the seabed reflection coefficient varies with the changing of grazing angle of the acoustic ray into seabed zou et al 2014 jensen et al 2011 further investigation considering the vertical gradient of sea water requires more complicated underwater acoustic model for example the normal mode method porter which adds difficulty to the deduction of the normal derivative of green function and the helmholtz integral function is of great disadvantage jiang et al jiang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 combined the simple source integration and normal mode method to calculate the acoustic radiation of elastic structure in shallow water positive and negative gradient environment huang huang et al 2019 adopted the wave superposition method and normal mode method and implemented the acoustic radiation and propagation of axial symmetric structure in shallow water negative thermocline gradient negative and positive gradient environment duan duan et al 2020 combined the fem bem method and beam displacement ray mode theory to investigate the far field acoustic radiation in ocean acoustical environment considering the sound speed profile of sea water ref jiang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 huang et al 2019 duan et al 2020 mainly focus on low frequency radiation which is not contaminated by irregular frequency therefore the calculation of the normal derivative of green function is not required for higher frequency boundary element integral problem the irregular frequency problem is unavoidable zhou zhou et al 2010 added a closed virtual impedance surface cvis inside the structural domain by assigning acoustic impedance of the fluid to the cvis the virtual surface can absorb the vibration energy of interior fluid domain so that the irregular frequency can be eliminated however the normal derivative is introduced into integral on cvis zou et al 2013 4 ϕ r 1 4 π s σ r r 0 g r r 0 d s 1 4 π s i 2 z s u n i 2 r 0 ρ 0 g r r 0 n i r 0 i ω g r r 0 u n i 2 r 0 d s r τ s in which s and s i 2 are the wetted surface and closed virtual impedance surface cvis respectively z s and u n i 2 are the characteristic impedance and normal displacement on cvis zou analyzed the magnitude of the single and double layer potential items on the cvis and further proposed a cvis α scheme zou et al 2018 so that the double layer potential item in eqn 4 can be neglected in this paper an fem bem scheme revised by cvis method is adopted to calculate the radiating source strength of the underwater structure since the distortion of acoustic rays due to the sound speed profile ssp is not severe in near field the green function g r r 0 based on virtual chain theory is used in the decoupling calculation for near receiving spots the three parameter seabed reflection model zou et al 2014 is adopted and the vertical gradient of sea water sound speed is neglected for far field receiving spots the influence of ssp must be taken into consideration in the green function g r r 0 so the beam displacement ray normal mode bdrm is adopted the main obstacle of this hybrid algorithm is the normal derivative of green function induced by cvis revision of which the analytical expression is difficult to deduce based on the bdrm theory in this paper the integrand of double layer potential on cvis in eqn 4 is converted into two equivalent single layer potential therefore at the irregular frequencies the cvis method can be applied to calculation of far field propagation of radiated sound pressure of underwater structure in ocean acoustic environment without the deduction of the analytical solution of the normal derivative of green function 2 theoretical model 2 1 fem bem and the equivalent source formulation of cvis method the fluid structure interactive boundary condition in eqn 1 zou et al 2014 is formed based on the dry modal displacement distribution as 5 ϕ r n i ω u r n x v r n y w r n z in which r is the order of dry modes the simple source integration revised by cvis method zhou et al 2010 zou et

σ r r and the normal vibration velocity of the interior cvis u r n i in eqn 5 ϕ is the radiating velocity potential ω 2 π f is the circular frequency r x y z and r 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 signify the affected spot and source spot respectively n means to take the normal derivative s and s i are the wetted surface and closed virtual impedance surface of which the normal vibration velocity and characteristic impedance are u r n i and z s i respectively zou zhou et al 2010 zou et al 2013 zou et al 2018 found that by taking z s i ρ 0 c 0 an optimized result can be acquired to eliminate the irregular frequency in which ρ 0 and c 0 are the density and sound speed of the fluid the generalized mass matrix a damping matrix b and stiffness matrix c of the dry structure are combined with the added mass matrix a added damping matrix b and generalized restoration force matrix c of the surrounding water to assemble the fluid structure interactive dynamic function zou et al 2013 7 ω 2 a a i ω b b c c q f e ω in which f e ω is the excitation force acted on the structure and the modal coordinate response q can be deduced from eqn 6 the added mass and added damping are related to the radiating potential ϕ which can be obtained according to eqn 1 and the elements in matrices a b and c are zou et al 2013 8 a r j ρ 0 ω 2 re s n u r i ω ϕ j d s b r j ρ 0 ω im s n u r i ω ϕ j d s c r j ρ 0 s n u r g w j d s in which g is the gravitational acceleration and w j is the vibration displacement along the z axis the radiating source strength is the superposition of the contribution of each mode 9 σ r 0 r 1 m q r σ r r 0 the contribution of the interior virtual impedance surface to the affected spot r can be expressed using helmholtz integral as zou et al 2013 10 ϕ r s i g r r 0 n r 0 z s ρ 0 r 1 m u r n i r 0 q r g r r 0 r 1 m i ω u r n i 2 r 0 q r d s for ocean acoustic environment considering the sound speed profile of sea water the analytical expression of green function g r r 0 is complicated and analytical deduction of its normal derivative at the first item in eqn 9 will take extra effort it should be noted that there are various theoretic model of underwater acoustic propagation for acoustic environment of different characteristics which of course calls for completely different analytical solution for the normal derivative of green function according to the definition of normal derivative the normal derivative of green function can be expressed as 11a g r r 0 n r 0 g r r 0 g r r 0 2 δ r δ r 0 in which r 0 r 0 δ r n r 0 and r 0 r 0 δ r n r 0 by taking 11b δ r β c 0 ω we can obtain g r r 0 g r r 0 g r r 0 in which β is a real constant then eqn 10 can be rewritten as 12 ϕ r s i g r r 0 σ r 0 g r r 0 σ r 0 d s in which σ r 0 and σ r 0 can be termed the equivalent outer source strength and inner strength to replace the contribution of the normal vibrating velocity and sound pressure of the virtual impedance surface r 0 and r 0 are the coordinates of the equivalent source strengths which is variable with the change of frequency taking z s i ρ 0 c 0 we can obtain 13 σ r 0 1 2 i β 1 r 1 m q r i ω u r n i r 0 σ r 0 1 2 i β 1 r 1 m q r i ω u r n i r 0 it can be seen that the contribution of the element centered at r 0 on the virtual impedance surface with the vibrating velocity i ω u n i is equivalent to a pair of monopoles whose source strengths are σ r 0 and σ r 0 in eqn 11 in order to satisfy the condition δ r 0 the value of β should be rather small on the condition β 1 the amplitudes of σ r 0 and σ r 0 are approximately equal and the phases approximately opposite therefore can be termed quasi dipole it should be noted that if the 1 and 1 in the bracket of eqn 14 is omitted to make the pair real dipole which is equivalently omitting the second item at the right side of eqn 11 errors will be arise the authors therefore suggest that more significant digits of the equivalent source strength be kept in eqn 14 to guarantee the precision of calculation 2 2 green function based on virtual source chain model when the receiving spot is not far from the structure the influence of sound speed gradient of sea water can be omitted for deep ocean environment the submerged depth of structures is usually small compared with the depth of the seabed thus the seabed reflection can be ignored and the sound field green function based on image model is acceptable for shallow waters of which of seabed depth is h the green function based on virtual source chain theory is of enough precision zhang et al 2020 14 g r r 0 n 0 v φ n

n f in the following in uniform shallow sea is calculated using three different methods the first is termed analytical method based on eqn 18 the second is termed virtual source chain numerical method based on eqns 14 and 11 the third is termed bdrm numerical method based on bdrm theory and eqn 11 the parameter β is assigned 0 001 the coordinates of source and receiving spots are 0 m 0 1 m 15 m and 40 m 0 m 15 m respectively and the depth of the sea is 40 m the normal derivative n r 0 is assigned 1 2 1 2 0 and 0 0 1 respectively three kinds of typical continental sediment seabed parameters shown in table 1 are investigated the results of the real and image parts of g n f are shown in fig 1 the relative errors of g n f calculated using virtual chain model and bdrm model combined with eqn 11a against that obtained analytically using eqn 18 are calculated using eqn 25 25 e r r o r 20 log 10 g n v i r t u a l s o u r c e c h a i n o r b d r m g n a n a l y t i c a l the results of relative errors are shown in fig 2 in which h stands for n r 0 1 2 1 2 0 and v for n r 0 0 0 1 respectively it can be observed from figs 1 and 2 that 1 in uniform shallow sea environment g n f calculated using virtual source chain model and according to eqns 14 and 11 is in good accordance with that obtained analytically using eqn 17 2 in the case where g n f is solved using bdrm algorithm combined with eqn 11 the error of result of the normal derivative along the horizontal direction is smaller while that along the vertical direction is a bit larger but still acceptable 3 since the location of observation spot is not so far from the shell the reflection coefficient of seabed is approximately a constant therefore the error introduced from the different methods to calculate the reflection coefficient of seabed is quite limited 3 2 verification of equivalent source cvis method 3 2 1 verification of equivalent source cvis method in infinite waters the precision of the proposed equivalent source cvis method is firstly verified in infinite waters using an elastic spherical shell the radius of the shell is 0 5 m and the thickness is 1 mm the elasticity modulus poisson ration and density of the material are 2 06 1011pa 0 3 and 7 8 103kg m3 respectively the dimension of fe and be mesh is 20 7 mm the length of the interior cvis is 0 4 m of which the mesh dimension is 50 mm as is shown in fig 3 the centre of the shell is assigned 0 m 0 m 0 m and the observation spot is located at 100 m 0 m 0 m the shell is acted at the bottom of the shell with a vertical point force as is shown in fig 3 and the amplitude of the force is 1 n and the frequency is 1 k 5 k hz the three dimensional sono elasticity theory is adopted to calculate the vibroacoustic radiation of the spherical shell combined with the equivalent source cvis method of which the results are compared with zou s results in ref zou 2014 the radiated sound pressure is calculated at the observation spot and then converted to spl located 1 m away from the centre of the shell according to eqn 26 26 l p ω 20 lg p r e c e i v e r 2 1 10 6 20 lg r s in which r s is the distance between the centre of shell and observation spot p r e c e i v e r is the amplitude of the sound pressure acquired at the observation spot the comparison of results is shown in fig 4 and the parameter β 0 001 it can be seen that the irregular frequency can be effectively remove using the equivalent source cvis method and the result of equivalent source cvis method are almost identical with that acquired analytically 3 2 2 verification of equivalent source cvis method in uniform shallow sea the spherical shell in part a is located in uniform shallow sea of which the depth of seabed is 40 m and sound speed of sea water is 1500 m s the value of parameter β dimension material thickness of shell mesh size excitation and location of the shell and receiving spot are all identical with part a the seabed density sound speed and sediment decaying coefficient are 1 77 g cm3 1623 m s and 0 673db m khz the cases for analyses are listed in table 2 and results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that 1 irregular frequencies can be observed in case a at 1500 hz ka π 3340 hz ka 6 99 3895 hz ka 8 18 4345 hz ka 9 1 4470 hz ka 9 36 4485 hz ka 3π 4975 hz ka 10 4 which is in good accordance with ref everstine and henderson 1987 however the irregular frequencies at 2145 hz ka 4 49 2750 hz ka 5 76 3000 hz ka 2π 3690 hz ka 7 73 and 4485 hz ka 3π according to ref everstine and henderson 1987 are not clearly observed the probable reasons is that the multi path propagation of acoustic wave in bounded waters lead to the interference of radiated sound pressure therefore the frequency response curve of radiated spl in bounded waters is dominated with rises and falls some irregular frequencies may be covered up due to the multi path effect 2 the curves of cases c and d do not coincide with that of case b completely because of the difference in the adopted seabed reflection model which is a constant 0 3 in case b but changes with grazing angle in cases c and d however irregular frequencies are eliminated well in all three cases except case a and the curves of cases c and d are almost identical 3 3 propagation behavior of radiated spl in shallow sea the ssp of sea water fundamentally changes the energy distribution of far field radiated sound so the beam displacement ray normal mode theory is adopted the far field radiated spl in typical shallow water ssp shown in fig 6 are calculated using no cvis method and equivalent source cvis method respectively the calculated range is 100 m 3000 m at the depth of 15 m and other parameters are identical with section 2 2b the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the range frequency response of radiated spl of spherical shell exhibits typical interference stripes in shallow waters without cvis revision strong linear spectrums appear at the irregular frequencies these fictitious frequencies are at 1505 hz ka π 2145 hz ka 4 49 only observed in fig 7g and quite vague 2750 hz ka 5 76 3000 hz ka 2π 3340 hz ka 6 99 3895 hz ka 8 18 4345 hz ka 9 1 4470 hz ka 9 36 4485 hz ka 3π 4975 hz ka 10 4 but quite vague as is in accordance with the first 11 irregular frequencies of spherical shell except ka 7 73 everstine and henderson 1987 if the investigation is revised with equivalent source cvis method these fictitious frequencies can be removed very well in shallow sea the seabed reflection is a significant impact factor on far field acoustic propagation here the three parameter seabed reflection model is adopted to investigate the influence of seabed parameters the three series of typical shallow water sediment seabed under investigation are shown in table 2 and the ssp is the negative thermocline gradient shown in fig 6b the excitation case is identical with that in section 2 2 and the acting frequency is 1505 hz the 1st irregular frequency shown in fig 7 the results are shown in fig 8 a d it can be seen from fig 8a c that the parameters of seabed sediment have a significant influence on far field radiated spl distribution as is shown in fig 8a for soft sediment with smaller seabed density and sound speed the far field radiated spl is lower especially at the depth range 30 m 40 m which is due to the smaller seabed reflection coefficient and smaller critical grazing angle ϕ in eqn 15 since the spherical shell is located above the thermocline layer the radiated spl at the depth range 0 m 20 m is much higher than that at the depth range 30 m 40 m for stiffer seabed sediment with larger seabed density and sound speed the far field radiated spl is higher and the gap between radiated spl at the depth range 0 m 20 m and at the depth range 30 m 40 m is smaller compared with fig 8a the difference between fig 8 b and d shows the error induced by irregular frequency as is shown in fig 8d without the equivalent source cvis modification the near field radiated spl is totally different from that in fig 8 b also the far field spl is much higher 3 4 propagation behavior of radiated spl in deep ocean the radiated spl of the spherical shell in deep ocean acoustic channel is investigated the ssp is the typical munk profile liu and jia yu 2010 shown in fig 9 whose acoustic channel is at the depth of 900 m the shell and receiving spots are located at the depth of 200 m and the observation range is 100 m 150 km the results are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the 1st and 2nd convergence zones are within the ranges of 50 km 70 km and 105 km 130 km respectively using the equivalent source cvis method the irregular frequencies can be eliminated quite well the appearance of the frequency of ka 7 73 in deep ocean investigation may be result from the weaker multipath effect of relatively near area in deep ocean environment 4 conclusions in the fem bem prediction of vibroacoustic problem of underwater elastic structure the phenomenon of irregular frequency will appear due to the be discretization the cvis revised sono elasticity theory zou et al 2013 solves the irregular frequency problem yet introduced the normal derivative of the green function if the influence of ocean acoustic environment is considered in the underwater vibroacoustic prediction a new difficulty arises that the analytical solution of green function in ocean acoustic environment is complicated and varies fundamentally and theoretically for different kinds of ocean acoustic environment so seeking the analytical solution of the normal derivative of the green function is not an optimized scheme based on ref zhou et al 2010 an equivalent source form of cvis is proposed in which the definition equation of normal derivative is adopted to convert the single and double layer potential integral including the normal derivative of green function into a pair of quasi dipoles only including green function therefore the equivalent source cvis method is quite applicable for fluid structure interactive vibroacoustic fem bem solution in ocean acoustic environment the proposed equivalent source cvis is verified in infinite uniform waters and uniform shallow sea environment using a spherical shell case the results in infinite waters are in good accordance with analytical solution the results in uniform shallow sea are obtained using virtual source chain three parameter seabed model and beam displacement ray normal mode respectively and all in good accordance with the results using three dimensional sono elasticity method zou et al 2014 the vibroacoustic radiation and propagation behavior of the spherical shell is investigated in shallow water uniform layer negative thermocline gradient negative positive gradient and deep ocean munk ssp environment the analyzed frequency is 1 k 5 k hz and results show that the equivalent source cvis can be adopted to eliminate the irregular frequencies credit authorship contribution statement duan jia xi methodology programming and original data preparation zhang lin visualization sun xue hai parallelization of program chen wen jing

21058,the acoustic wave propagating in ocean is severely distorted due to the sound speed profile of sea water and the reflection and absorption of seabed the fem bem is a preferable method to solve the fluid structure interactive vibration and sound radiation problem of underwater structure in ocean acoustic environment since the green function can be applied in the integral equation the simple source integral method is more preferable compared with helmholtz integral because the calculation of normal derivative of green function is avoided in order to remove the irregular frequency problem zhou zhou et al 2010 proposed a cvis theory which however introduced the normal derivative of green function on cvis surface and limited its application into ocean acoustical environment therefore an equivalent source formulation of cvis is proposed based on the definition of normal derivative so that the normal derivative of green function on the integration of cvis is replaced the radiated spl of spherical shell is calculated in shallow and deep sea with various sound speed profiles it is shown that the equivalent source cvis can be used to eliminate the irregular frequency problem of the far field radiated sound pressure of underwater elastic structure in ocean acoustic environment keywords sound speed gradient simple source integral irregular frequency acoustic radiation sound propagation 1 introduction 1the calculation of vibroacoustic properties of shell structure is of significant engineering meaning huang et al 2020 zarastvand et al 1007 on the prediction of underwater fluid structure interactive vibration and acoustic radiation of complicated structure the coupled fem bem is a prevailing algorithm because the green function can be chosen according to the characteristics of acoustical environment wu et al 2016 the integral function on the wetted surface can be of a simple source formulation zhou and joseph 2005 1 ϕ r s g r r 0 σ r 0 d s in which g r r 0 is the sound field green function between source r 0 and receiving spot r and σ is the distributed source strength on wetted surface ϕ is the radiated velocity potential in the fluid domain another available function is the helmholtz integral function employed by everstine et al everstine and henderson 1990 2 1 2 ϕ r s ϕ r 0 g r r 0 n r 0 g r r 0 ϕ r 0 n r 0 d s in which means to take the normal derivative on wetted surface however at the resonant frequencies of interior fluid domain the solution of simple source integral does not exist while that of helmholtz integral is non unique the so called irregular frequency problem is introduced by boundary element discretization but of no physical existence which is demonstrated by schenck schenck 1967 in order to eliminate the irregular frequency in helmholtz integral schenck schenck 1967 proposed a combined helmholtz integral equation formulation chief method in which several integration spots are added to the interior domain to form an overdetermined equation to be decoupled using lsm however if the added integration spot is just on the nodal surface of the resonant interior fluid domain the spot is invalid although one valid interior spot is enough to remove the irregular frequency the nodal surfaces are more closely spaced and the selection of chief spot will be very difficult seybert and rengarajan 1987 wu and seybert wu and seybert 1991 further proposed a chief block method instead of the chief point so that the invalidation of chief point on nodal surfaces is solved the singular value decomposition method on the coefficient matrix proposed by juhl juhl 1994 and chen chen et al 2009 can be used to predict the number of added interior spots to eliminate the irregular frequency and verify whether the spot is valid according to the coordinate of the spot however for higher acting frequency of structures with complex geometry there is still some difficulty in using chief method the burton miller method burton and miller 1971 is mathematically stricter compared with chief the eigen frequency of helmholtz function and that of the normal derivative of helmholtz function are not identical a coupling coefficient α is used to superpose the two functions to obtain 3 1 2 ϕ r α 2 ϕ r n r s ϕ r 0 g r r 0 n r 0 d s s g r r 0 ϕ r 0 n r 0 d s α s ϕ r 0 2 g r r 0 n r n r 0 d s α s g r r 0 n r ϕ r 0 n r 0 d s to eliminate the irregular frequency in real number domain the coupling coefficient α should be a pure image number it is observed in further research that a better result can be achieved by setting α i k than α i harris and amini 1992 in which i 1 and the wavenumber k 2 π f c on the selection of α marburg marburg 2014 has made a detailed review and compared the iterations required of various α values marburg 2016 the main difficulty of burton miller algorithm is the hypersingular item in eqn 3 which is time consuming in calculation liu liu and chen 1999 and chen chen and jinharris 2009 provided a weak singular form of the hypersingular item in eqn 3 using static green function in infinite acoustic field for the half infinite waters the green function using image method can be applied to the boundary element integral guo et al 2017 the virtual chain green function is required if the influence of seabed sediment absorption should be included zou et al 2014 if the receiving spot is not so far from the structure the seabed reflection coefficient is approximately a constant wu et al 2016 for far field observation spots the seabed reflection coefficient varies with the changing of grazing angle of the acoustic ray into seabed zou et al 2014 jensen et al 2011 further investigation considering the vertical gradient of sea water requires more complicated underwater acoustic model for example the normal mode method porter which adds difficulty to the deduction of the normal derivative of green function and the helmholtz integral function is of great disadvantage jiang et al jiang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 combined the simple source integration and normal mode method to calculate the acoustic radiation of elastic structure in shallow water positive and negative gradient environment huang huang et al 2019 adopted the wave superposition method and normal mode method and implemented the acoustic radiation and propagation of axial symmetric structure in shallow water negative thermocline gradient negative and positive gradient environment duan duan et al 2020 combined the fem bem method and beam displacement ray mode theory to investigate the far field acoustic radiation in ocean acoustical environment considering the sound speed profile of sea water ref jiang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 huang et al 2019 duan et al 2020 mainly focus on low frequency radiation which is not contaminated by irregular frequency therefore the calculation of the normal derivative of green function is not required for higher frequency boundary element integral problem the irregular frequency problem is unavoidable zhou zhou et al 2010 added a closed virtual impedance surface cvis inside the structural domain by assigning acoustic impedance of the fluid to the cvis the virtual surface can absorb the vibration energy of interior fluid domain so that the irregular frequency can be eliminated however the normal derivative is introduced into integral on cvis zou et al 2013 4 ϕ r 1 4 π s σ r r 0 g r r 0 d s 1 4 π s i 2 z s u n i 2 r 0 ρ 0 g r r 0 n i r 0 i ω g r r 0 u n i 2 r 0 d s r τ s in which s and s i 2 are the wetted surface and closed virtual impedance surface cvis respectively z s and u n i 2 are the characteristic impedance and normal displacement on cvis zou analyzed the magnitude of the single and double layer potential items on the cvis and further proposed a cvis α scheme zou et al 2018 so that the double layer potential item in eqn 4 can be neglected in this paper an fem bem scheme revised by cvis method is adopted to calculate the radiating source strength of the underwater structure since the distortion of acoustic rays due to the sound speed profile ssp is not severe in near field the green function g r r 0 based on virtual chain theory is used in the decoupling calculation for near receiving spots the three parameter seabed reflection model zou et al 2014 is adopted and the vertical gradient of sea water sound speed is neglected for far field receiving spots the influence of ssp must be taken into consideration in the green function g r r 0 so the beam displacement ray normal mode bdrm is adopted the main obstacle of this hybrid algorithm is the normal derivative of green function induced by cvis revision of which the analytical expression is difficult to deduce based on the bdrm theory in this paper the integrand of double layer potential on cvis in eqn 4 is converted into two equivalent single layer potential therefore at the irregular frequencies the cvis method can be applied to calculation of far field propagation of radiated sound pressure of underwater structure in ocean acoustic environment without the deduction of the analytical solution of the normal derivative of green function 2 theoretical model 2 1 fem bem and the equivalent source formulation of cvis method the fluid structure interactive boundary condition in eqn 1 zou et al 2014 is formed based on the dry modal displacement distribution as 5 ϕ r n i ω u r n x v r n y w r n z in which r is the order of dry modes the simple source integration revised by cvis method zhou et al 2010 zou et al 2013 6 ϕ r r n r 1 2 σ r r 1 4 π s σ r r 0 g r r 0 n r d s i ω 4 π s i u r n i r 0 g r r 0 n r z s i u r n i r 0 ρ 0 2 g r r 0 n i r 0 n r d s r s is adopted to solve the radiating source strength σ r r and the normal vibration velocity of the interior cvis u r n i in eqn 5 ϕ is the radiating velocity potential ω 2 π f is the circular frequency r x y z and r 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 signify the affected spot and source spot respectively n means to take the normal derivative s and s i are the wetted surface and closed virtual impedance surface of which the normal vibration velocity and characteristic impedance are u r n i and z s i respectively zou zhou et al 2010 zou et al 2013 zou et al 2018 found that by taking z s i ρ 0 c 0 an optimized result can be acquired to eliminate the irregular frequency in which ρ 0 and c 0 are the density and sound speed of the fluid the generalized mass matrix a damping matrix b and stiffness matrix c of the dry structure are combined with the added mass matrix a added damping matrix b and generalized restoration force matrix c of the surrounding water to assemble the fluid structure interactive dynamic function zou et al 2013 7 ω 2 a a i ω b b c c q f e ω in which f e ω is the excitation force acted on the structure and the modal coordinate response q can be deduced from eqn 6 the added mass and added damping are related to the radiating

r g w j d s in which g is the gravitational acceleration and w j is the vibration displacement along the z axis the radiating source strength is the superposition of the contribution of each mode 9 σ

m u r n i r 0 q r g r r 0 r 1 m i ω u r n i 2 r 0 q r d s for ocean acoustic environment considering the sound speed profile of sea water the analytical expression of green function g r r 0 is complicated and analytical deduction of its normal derivative at the first item in eqn 9 will take extra effort it should be noted that there are various theoretic model of underwater acoustic propagation for acoustic environment of different characteristics which of course calls for completely different analytical solution for the normal derivative of green function according to the definition of normal derivative the normal derivative of green function can be expressed as 11a g r r 0 n r 0 g r r 0 g r r 0 2 δ r δ r 0 in which r 0 r 0 δ r n r 0 and r 0 r 0 δ r n r 0 by taking 11b δ r β c 0 ω we can obtain g r r 0 g r r 0 g r r 0 in which β is a real constant then eqn 10 can be rewritten as 12 ϕ r s i g r r 0 σ r 0 g r r 0 σ r 0 d s in which σ r 0 and σ r 0 can be termed the equivalent outer source strength and inner strength to replace the contribution of the normal vibrating velocity and sound pressure of the virtual impedance surface r 0 and r 0 are the coordinates of the equivalent source strengths which is variable with the change of frequency taking z s i ρ 0 c 0 we can obtain 13 σ r 0 1 2 i β 1 r 1 m q r i ω u r n i r 0 σ r 0 1 2 i β 1 r 1 m q r i ω u r n i r 0 it can be seen that the contribution of the element centered at r 0 on the virtual impedance surface with the vibrating velocity i ω u n i is equivalent to a pair of monopoles whose source strengths are σ r 0 and σ r 0 in eqn 11 in order to satisfy the condition δ r 0 the value of β should be rather small on the condition β 1 the amplitudes of σ r 0 and σ r 0 are approximately equal and the phases approximately opposite therefore can be termed quasi dipole it should be noted that if the 1 and 1 in the bracket of eqn 14 is omitted to make the pair real dipole which is equivalently omitting the second item at the right side of eqn 11 errors will be arise the authors therefore suggest that more significant digits of the equivalent source strength be kept in eqn 14 to guarantee the precision of calculation 2 2 green function based on virtual source chain model when the receiving spot is not far from the structure the influence of sound speed gradient of sea water can be omitted for deep ocean environment the submerged depth of structures is usually small compared with the depth of the seabed thus the seabed reflection can be ignored and the sound field green function based on image model is acceptable for shallow waters of which of seabed depth is h the green function based on virtual source chain theory is of enough precision zhang et al 2020 14 g r r 0 n 0 v φ n

n f in the following in uniform shallow sea is calculated using three different methods the first is termed analytical method based on eqn 18 the second is termed virtual source chain numerical method based on eqns 14 and 11 the third is termed bdrm numerical method based on bdrm theory and eqn 11 the parameter β is assigned 0 001 the coordinates of source and receiving spots are 0 m 0 1 m 15 m and 40 m 0 m 15 m respectively and the depth of the sea is 40 m the normal derivative n r 0 is assigned 1 2 1 2 0 and 0 0 1 respectively three kinds of typical continental sediment seabed parameters shown in table 1 are investigated the results of the real and image parts of g n f are shown in fig 1 the relative errors of g n f calculated using virtual chain model and bdrm model combined with eqn 11a against that obtained analytically using eqn 18 are calculated using eqn 25 25 e r r o r 20 log 10 g n v i r t u a l s o u r c e c h a i n o r b d r m g n a n a l y t i c a l the results of relative errors are shown in fig 2 in which h stands for n r 0 1 2 1 2 0 and v for n r 0 0 0 1 respectively it can be observed from figs 1 and 2 that 1 in uniform shallow sea environment g n f calculated using virtual source chain model and according to eqns 14 and 11 is in good accordance with that obtained analytically using eqn 17 2 in the case where g n f is solved using bdrm algorithm combined with eqn 11 the error of result of the normal derivative along the horizontal direction is smaller while that along the vertical direction is a bit larger but still acceptable 3 since the location of observation spot is not so far from the shell the reflection coefficient of seabed is approximately a constant therefore the error introduced from the different methods to calculate the reflection coefficient of seabed is quite limited 3 2 verification of equivalent source cvis method 3 2 1 verification of equivalent source cvis method in infinite waters the precision of the proposed equivalent source cvis method is firstly verified in infinite waters using an elastic spherical shell the radius of the shell is 0 5 m and the thickness is 1 mm the elasticity modulus poisson ration and density of the material are 2 06 1011pa 0 3 and 7 8 103kg m3 respectively the dimension of fe and be mesh is 20 7 mm the length of the interior cvis is 0 4 m of which the mesh dimension is 50 mm as is shown in fig 3 the centre of the shell is assigned 0 m 0 m 0 m and the observation spot is located at 100 m 0 m 0 m the shell is acted at the bottom of the shell with a vertical point force as is shown in fig 3 and the amplitude of the force is 1 n and the frequency is 1 k 5 k hz the three dimensional sono elasticity theory is adopted to calculate the vibroacoustic radiation of the spherical shell combined with the equivalent source cvis method of which the results are compared with zou s results in ref zou 2014 the radiated sound pressure is calculated at the observation spot and then converted to spl located 1 m away from the centre of the shell according to eqn 26 26 l p ω 20 lg p r e c e i v e r 2 1 10 6 20 lg r s in which r s is the distance between the centre of shell and observation spot p r e c e i v e r is the amplitude of the sound pressure acquired at the observation spot the comparison of results is shown in fig 4 and the parameter β 0 001 it can be seen that the irregular frequency can be effectively remove using the equivalent source cvis method and the result of equivalent source cvis method are almost identical with that acquired analytically 3 2 2 verification of equivalent source cvis method in uniform shallow sea the spherical shell in part a is located in uniform shallow sea of which the depth of seabed is 40 m and sound speed of sea water is 1500 m s the value of parameter β dimension material thickness of shell mesh size excitation and location of the shell and receiving spot are all identical with part a the seabed density sound speed and sediment decaying coefficient are 1 77 g cm3 1623 m s and 0 673db m khz the cases for analyses are listed in table 2 and results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that 1 irregular frequencies can be observed in case a at 1500 hz ka π 3340 hz ka 6 99 3895 hz ka 8 18 4345 hz ka 9 1 4470 hz ka 9 36 4485 hz ka 3π 4975 hz ka 10 4 which is in good accordance with ref everstine and henderson 1987 however the irregular frequencies at 2145 hz ka 4 49 2750 hz ka 5 76 3000 hz ka 2π 3690 hz ka 7 73 and 4485 hz ka 3π according to ref everstine and henderson 1987 are not clearly observed the probable reasons is that the multi path propagation of acoustic wave in bounded waters lead to the interference of radiated sound pressure therefore the frequency response curve of radiated spl in bounded waters is dominated with rises and falls some irregular frequencies may be covered up due to the multi path effect 2 the curves of cases c and d do not coincide with that of case b completely because of the difference in the adopted seabed reflection model which is a constant 0 3 in case b but changes with grazing angle in cases c and d however irregular frequencies are eliminated well in all three cases except case a and the curves of cases c and d are almost identical 3 3 propagation behavior of radiated spl in shallow sea the ssp of sea water fundamentally changes the energy distribution of far field radiated sound so the beam displacement ray normal mode theory is adopted the far field radiated spl in typical shallow water ssp shown in fig 6 are calculated using no cvis method and equivalent source cvis method respectively the calculated range is 100 m 3000 m at the depth of 15 m and other parameters are identical with section 2 2b the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the range frequency response of radiated spl of spherical shell exhibits typical interference stripes in shallow waters without cvis revision strong linear spectrums appear at the irregular frequencies these fictitious frequencies are at 1505 hz ka π 2145 hz ka 4 49 only observed in fig 7g and quite vague 2750 hz ka 5 76 3000 hz ka 2π 3340 hz ka 6 99 3895 hz ka 8 18 4345 hz ka 9 1 4470 hz ka 9 36 4485 hz ka 3π 4975 hz ka 10 4 but quite vague as is in accordance with the first 11 irregular frequencies of spherical shell except ka 7 73 everstine and henderson 1987 if the investigation is revised with equivalent source cvis method these fictitious frequencies can be removed very well in shallow sea the seabed reflection is a significant impact factor on far field acoustic propagation here the three parameter seabed reflection model is adopted to investigate the influence of seabed parameters the three series of typical shallow water sediment seabed under investigation are shown in table 2 and the ssp is the negative thermocline gradient shown in fig 6b the excitation case is identical with that in section 2 2 and the acting frequency is 1505 hz the 1st irregular frequency shown in fig 7 the results are shown in fig 8 a d it can be seen from fig 8a c that the parameters of seabed sediment have a significant influence on far field radiated spl distribution as is shown in fig 8a for soft sediment with smaller seabed density and sound speed the far field radiated spl is lower especially at the depth range 30 m 40 m which is due to the smaller seabed reflection coefficient and smaller critical grazing angle ϕ in eqn 15 since the spherical shell is located above the thermocline layer the radiated spl at the depth range 0 m 20 m is much higher than that at the depth range 30 m 40 m for stiffer seabed sediment with larger seabed density and sound speed the far field radiated spl is higher and the gap between radiated spl at the depth range 0 m 20 m and at the depth range 30 m 40 m is smaller compared with fig 8a the difference between fig 8 b and d shows the error induced by irregular frequency as is shown in fig 8d without the equivalent source cvis modification the near field radiated spl is totally different from that in fig 8 b also the far field spl is much higher 3 4 propagation behavior of radiated spl in deep ocean the radiated spl of the spherical shell in deep ocean acoustic channel is investigated the ssp is the typical munk profile liu and jia yu 2010 shown in fig 9 whose acoustic channel is at the depth of 900 m the shell and receiving spots are located at the depth of 200 m and the observation range is 100 m 150 km the results are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the 1st and 2nd convergence zones are within the ranges of 50 km 70 km and 105 km 130 km respectively using the equivalent source cvis method the irregular frequencies can be eliminated quite well the appearance of the frequency of ka 7 73 in deep ocean investigation may be result from the weaker multipath effect of relatively near area in deep ocean environment 4 conclusions in the fem bem prediction of vibroacoustic problem of underwater elastic structure the phenomenon of irregular frequency will appear due to the be discretization the cvis revised sono elasticity theory zou et al 2013 solves the irregular frequency problem yet introduced the normal derivative of the green function if the influence of ocean acoustic environment is considered in the underwater vibroacoustic prediction a new difficulty arises that the analytical solution of green function in ocean acoustic environment is complicated and varies fundamentally and theoretically for different kinds of ocean acoustic environment so seeking the analytical solution of the normal derivative of the green function is not an optimized scheme based on ref zhou et al 2010 an equivalent source form of cvis is proposed in which the definition equation of normal derivative is adopted to convert the single and double layer potential integral including the normal derivative of green function into a pair of quasi dipoles only including green function therefore the equivalent source cvis method is quite applicable for fluid structure interactive vibroacoustic fem bem solution in ocean acoustic environment the proposed equivalent source cvis is verified in infinite uniform waters and uniform shallow sea environment using a spherical shell case the results in infinite waters are in good accordance with analytical solution the results in uniform shallow sea are obtained using virtual source chain three parameter seabed model and beam displacement ray normal mode respectively and all in good accordance with the results using three dimensional sono elasticity method zou et al 2014 the vibroacoustic radiation and propagation behavior of the spherical shell is investigated in shallow water uniform layer negative thermocline gradient negative positive gradient and deep ocean munk ssp environment the analyzed frequency is 1 k 5 k hz and results show that the equivalent source cvis can be adopted to eliminate the irregular

21059,this paper presents a numerical investigation on the high frequency wave loads and ringing responses of offshore wind turbine foundations exposed to steep waves a time domain nonlinear potential flow model is developed based on the weak scatterer approximation on the free surface an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted in the time marching process the higher order boundary element method hobem is employed to solve the corresponding boundary value problem at each time step the proposed model is verified by a series of nonlinear wave diffraction problems in regular waves it appears that in terms of the wave run up and higher harmonic wave forces the present results are all in satisfactory agreement with the published experimental results and other theoretical or numerical solutions the ringing response of a bottom hinged monopile exposed to moderately steep focused wave groups is subsequently investigated for several different wave conditions the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response are discussed keywords weak scatterer approximation hobem monopile higher harmonic wave loads ringing response 1 introduction in offshore and ocean engineering high frequency wave loads occurring in steep wave conditions have been identified since the 1990s the high frequency wave loads are typically excited on gravity based platforms gbss and tension leg platforms tlps and they may generate a rapid build up of vibrations at the resonance frequency of the lightly damped offshore structure grue 2002 the phenomenon of the high frequency resonant response is so called ringing due to its sudden appearance and much slower decay unlike springing ringing usually occurs during the passage of steep wave crests and can generate fairly high levels of stress within a burst of only a few oscillations this phenomenon has been widely studied by the oil and gas industry from the 1990s and it has been observed both in the model tests and field conditions as shown in the ringing report stansberg 1993 ringing may also occur in offshore wind turbine foundations which has recently been a hotspot issue since ringing induced loads may be relevant to extreme loads and fatigue however these cannot be well modeled by classical analysis tools such as the linear and second order wave diffraction radiation models based on the perturbation expansion method proper and efficient numerical models of predicting these loads and responses are still lacking a range of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out with regard to the phenomenon of ringing the experimental studies have been implemented in wave tanks or wave basins with incoming focused wave groups grue et al 1993 chaplin et al 1997 scolan et al 1997 zang et al 2010 steep random waves stansberg et al 1995 bachynski et al 2017 riise et al 2018 and periodic waves huseby and grue 2000 kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 the main focus of the theoretical studies has been to capture the wave forces up to the third harmonic component in regular waves such as the theory of faltinsen et al 1995 referred to as the fnv theory and the solution of malenica and molin 1995 the original fnv theory was firstly obtained for the case of regular incident waves in deep water and secondly generalized by newman 1996 to irregular waves the first three harmonics of the horizontal wave force on a slender surface piercing vertical cylinder were formulated based on a third order perturbation analysis in the long wave regime the solution of malenica and molin 1995 was derived based on a complete third order diffraction theory in finite water depth which could capture the third harmonic force in regular waves by complicated integrals of the first second and third order velocity potentials however the approach is only applicable to the wave diffraction of vertical cylinders in regular waves with small steepness and too difficult to extend to the actual irregular sea states in view of the simplification of these approaches neither of these theoretical studies involves the condition of steep transient waves or breaking waves nor is the valid application range of the approaches clear even in regular waves some fully nonlinear potential flow models have also been proposed ferrant 1998 shao and faltinsen 2014a as well as the cfd models e g paulsen et al 2014 chen et al 2014 in recent years however both the fully nonlinear and cfd models are still time consuming for practical applications and present some weaknesses in terms of the remeshing algorithm and robustness for now theories and analysis models about the high frequency wave loads forces and moments and ringing responses in realistic sea states still have some drawbacks further wave load mechanisms are not fully understood particularly in steep transient waves the purpose of this study is to gain further insight into the modeling of steep wave impacts on offshore wind turbine foundations while maintaining a reasonable amount of computation time the monopile support structures are widely used in the offshore wind industry due to the simple yet robust design by comparison with other foundation concepts in the field conditions the diameter of the monopile is typically less than 8 m the first mode natural period is 3 5 s and the damping ratio is 1 4 kallehave et al 2015 while the typical peak period of the extreme sea state in the north sea is t p 15 s grue and huseby 2002 which is about three to five times longer than the resonance period of the structure in general the waves are moderately steep or even breaking when ringing occurs thus the wave height is comparable to the diameter of the monopile nevertheless the diameter of the monopile is relatively small compared with the characteristic wavelengths so that the diffraction effect of the structure in this phenomenon is generally slight as stated above a weakly nonlinear approach based on the weak scatterer approximation may be a promising alternative which was pioneered by pawlowski 1992 and then developed by kim and kim 2009 for nonlinear ship motions in this approach the scattered wave components due to the influence of the structure is assumed to be small with respect to the incident waves under this condition fully nonlinear free surface conditions can be linearized around the incident wave elevation this is advantageous for meshing algorithms since the geometry of the computational domain is known explicitly at every time step although it should be newly set up on the exact wetted body surface and incident free surface during the time marching process as a result this approach seems more robust and efficient than the fully nonlinear method despite the fact that a range of applications in offshore renewable energy industry also satisfy this condition particularly the monopile supported offshore wind turbines owts and point absorber wave energy converters wecs only a few numerical models have been developed using this class of approximation so far letournel et al 2014 2018 developed a weakly nonlinear model for submerged bodies and applied it to two submerged wecs the ceto and the waveroller the model was then extended to a surface piercing vertical cylinder in chauvigné et al 2015 in their numerical model the potential flow theory is adopted and the boundary value problem is solved by means of the boundary element method bem based on linear isoparametric triangular elements in this paper on the basis of the weak scatterer approximation a time domain nonlinear potential flow model is developed to deal with the interaction between moderately steep waves and surface piercing bodies the higher order boundary element method hobem is employed to solve the corresponding boundary value problem at each time step the 4th order runge kutta time integration scheme with an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian approach is adopted for the nonlinear free surface time marching process in addition two efficient algorithms have been integrated for dealing with mesh deformations so that the computational mesh can be adapted to the moving body surface and free surface geometry it is noted that the practical motivation of this study is to provide an improved numerical model for computing the higher harmonic wave loads and ringing response of offshore wind turbine foundations but the proposed model is also applicable to a range of other problems such as the nonlinear seakeeping analysis of ships and hydrodynamic performance evaluation of point absorber wave energy converters the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 and section 3 describe the mathematical formulation of the problem and the numerical implementation of the time domain nonlinear potential flow model in detail respectively a short overview of the fourier and wavelet transforms is given in section 4 for processing and analyzing the time domain results in section 5 numerical simulations are firstly conducted and verified for a series of nonlinear wave diffraction problems in regular waves and the comparisons with the theoretical solutions and published experimental results are provided in terms of the wave run up profile and higher harmonic wave forces on a bottom mounted vertical cylinder afterwards the ringing response of a bottom hinged monopile in focused wave groups is investigated for several different wave conditions in addition the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response are discussed respectively finally the main conclusions of the paper are summarized in section 6 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 weak scatterer approximation and boundary value problem we consider a three dimensional fluid domain ω bounded by a free surface s f a body surface s b and a flat bottom surface s d two right handed cartesian coordinate systems are defined as shown in fig 1 one is the space fixed coordinate system oxyz with the origin o on the mean water surface and its z axis pointing vertically upwards the other is the body fixed coordinate system o x y z the two sets of coordinate systems coincide with each other when the body is at its equilibrium position in this study a translational vector ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 is introduced to denote the displacements of surge sway and heave and a rotational vector θ α β γ ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 is introduced to denote the angles of roll pitch and yaw then the relationship between these two coordinate systems can be written as 1 x y z x r y r z r ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t x x r y y r z z r where x r x r y r z r is the center of rotation in the body fixed coordinate system t is the transformation matrix defined as ma 1998 2 t cos β cos γ cos β sin γ sin β sin α sin β cos γ cos α sin γ sin α sin β sin γ cos α cos γ sin α cos β cos α sin β cos γ sin α sin γ cos α sin β sin γ sin α cos γ cos α cos β the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the fluid flow is irrotational within the framework of potential flow theory the fluid motion can be described by a velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace s equation within the fluid domain ω 3 2 φ 0 on the instantaneous free water surface s f the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are given as 4 η t φ z φ η 5 φ t g η 1 2 φ φ where η is the free surface elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration on the wetted body surface s b the boundary condition is based on the impermeability of the body surface and thus the normal velocity of the flow equals that of the body surface i e 6 φ n v n where n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain as shown in fig 1 and v is the velocity vector of a point on the body surface if a small angular motion is assumed the motion of a three dimensional rigid body can be described in terms of six components and the velocity of the body surface can be expressed as 7 v u ω r b where u ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 is the translational velocity ω ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 is the angular velocity and r b is the position vector of a point on the body surface relative to the center of rotation on other rigid boundaries e g s d the no flux neumann condition is applied as 8 φ n 0 for wave structure interaction problems it is efficient to make a nonlinear decomposition of the solution of the whole problem the total velocity potential and free surface elevation φ η are split into an incident component φ i η i and a scattered component φ s η s due to the influence of the structure inside the domain it is assumed that the scattered component is small with respect to the incident one which is the so called weak scatterer approximation pawlowski 1992 9 φ φ i φ s φ s φ i η η i η s η s η i in the present study φ i and η i are assumed to be known explicitly which can be obtained by a dedicated wave model e g a stream function model rienecker and fenton 1981 for regular waves and the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 ning et al 2009 or a high order spectral model ducrozet et al 2012 2016 for irregular waves as a result only the rest parts of the solution φ s and η s need to be solved this technique of separating an explicit solution from the total solution has been successfully applied to the nonlinear wave structure interaction by many researchers such as ferrant 1998 ferrant et al 2003 and ducrozet et al 2014 the advantages of this separating technique may be listed as follows firstly the incident waves are known explicitly based on a dedicated wave model without the effect of time and space discretization during the whole propagation secondly since the scattered waves that caused by the structure decay with the increase of the distance from the body we can use refined mesh close to the body of interest and relatively coarse mesh away from it this results in a considerable reduction of the problem size and computational effort during the solution of wave structure interaction without loss of accuracy in addition it offers a very convenient way to set the far field boundary condition for irregular sea states by setting all the scattered terms equal to zero at the control surface that is sufficiently far from the body an artificial damping layer is also adopted to ensure this condition which will be outlined in the following text on the basis of the weak scatterer approximation the kinematic and dynamic free surface conditions are linearized around the incident wave elevation z η i x y t using the first order taylor series expansion an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted to track the free surface nodes in the reference system linked to the incident free surface a particular time derivative operator is defined as 10 δ δ t t v mesh where v mesh is the mesh velocity on the incident free surface which is defined such as the free surface nodes follow the body in its horizontal motions and they follow the motion of the incident wave elevation vertically note that for a fixed surface piercing body the horizontal components of v mesh are set to zero for convenience leading to v mesh 0 0 η i t nevertheless for a floating body the calculation of v mesh will be introduced in section 3 3 applying the above flow decomposition and weak scatterer approximation into the free surface conditions leads to the following equations for the time derivative of η s and φ s 11 δ η s δ t φ s z φ i v mesh η s φ s η i η s 2 φ i z 2 η i φ i z ν r η s at z η i x y t 12 δ φ s δ t g η s φ i v mesh φ s η s z φ i t 1 2 φ i φ i ν r φ s at z η i x y t in these equations the terms involving φ i and η i can be considered as forcing terms evaluated by the incident wave model damping terms involving ν r have also been included r denotes the distance from the origin in the horizontal plane and they are used to model the absorbing beach to ensure that the scattered waves can gradually dissipate far from the body in this study the damping coefficient ν r is chosen as bai and eatock taylor 2006 13 ν r α 0 ω r r 0 β 0 λ 2 r 0 r r d r 0 β 0 λ 0 r r 0 where ω is the characteristic frequency of wave motion λ is a representative wavelength r d is the radius of the outer circular computational domain and two parameters α 0 and β 0 are used to control the strength of the damping layer and the width of the absorbing beach respectively these are both chosen to be 1 0 in the present study the velocity potential φ s satisfies the laplace s equation within the fluid domain and is subject to the neumann condition on the instantaneous wetted surface of the body 14 φ s n φ i n v n on s b for a fixed body the normal velocity of the body surface v n v n 0 and the scattered potential reduces to the diffraction potential in addition since the proposed problem is solved in the time domain an initial condition must also be imposed the initial conditions can be taken as 15 φ s 0 η s 0 at t 0 which are corresponding to the incident wave field without perturbation 2 2 higher order boundary element method the boundary integral equation method is used to solve the above nonlinear boundary value problem using green s second identity we can derive an integral equation for the scattered potential φ s over the whole boundary s as 16 α x 0 φ s x 0 s φ s x g x x 0 n g x x 0 φ s x n d s where x 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and x x y z are source and field points respectively α x 0 is the interior solid angle at the point x 0 and g x x 0 is the green s function for the cases in which the body and the simulated flow are symmetric about the x z plane and the seabed is horizontal the rankine source and its images with regard to the symmetry plane y 0 and the seabed z d can be adopted as the green s function thus only half of the computational domain is considered and the seabed surface is excluded under these conditions the green s function can be written as 17 g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 3 1 r 4 where 18 r 1 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 2 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 3 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 d 2 r 4 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 d 2 applying a dirichlet condition on the free surface and neumann conditions on the rest of the fluid boundary a mixed fredholm integral equation of the first kind on the free surface and of the second kind elsewhere is obtained the higher order boundary element method hobem is subsequently employed to solve the integral equation which is generally regarded as more efficient and accurate than the constant panel method in the method the boundary surface is discretized by quadratic isoparametric elements after the shape function h k ζ ς is introduced in each element the position coordinate the velocity potential and its derivatives within an element can be expressed in terms of nodal values the expressions of which are written as 19 x ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς x k φ s ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k φ s n ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k n where ζ ς denotes the local intrinsic coordinates x k φ s k and φ s k n are the nodal coordinates potentials and normal derivatives of the potential corresponding to the kth node in the quadratic isoparametric element k is the total number of nodes in the element i e eight and six for quadrilateral and triangular elements respectively an important numerical issue of the hobem is the evaluation of solid angle and cauchy principle value cpv integrals in the boundary integral equation in the present study the solid angle is directly calculated based on the method proposed by montic 1993 the cpv integrals are obtained by using the triangular polar coordinate transformation technique described by eatock taylor and chau 1992 finally the resulting discretized algebra equations can be expressed as 20 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 x 1 x 2 b 1 b 2 where 21 x 1 φ s 1 φ s 2 φ s n b 22 x 2 φ s n 1 φ s n 2 φ s n n f 23 a i j 11 α x i δ i j a i j 21 24 a i j 21 n 1 n b m 1 m g x m x i n h k ζ ς w m j m ζ ς 25 a i j 12 a i j 22 n 1 n f m 1 m g x m x i h k ζ ς w m j m ζ ς 26 b i 1 n 1 n b m 1 m g x m x i φ s x m n w m j m ζ ς n 1 n f m 1 m φ s x m g x m x i n w m j m ζ ς 27 b i 2 α x i φ s x i b i 1 here δ i j denotes the kronecker delta function with δ i j 1 i j and δ i j 0 i j n b and n f are the numbers of nodes on the body and free surface boundaries respectively n b and n f are the numbers of elements on the body and free surface boundaries respectively m is the number of sampling points used in the standard gauss legendre method for the numerical calculation of the integration over each element w m is the integral weight at the mth sampling point j m ζ ς is the determinant of the jacobian matrix from the global coordinates to the local intrinsic coordinates after assembling the equations for each node on the whole integral surface a system of linear algebraic equations is established then the solution of the above boundary value problem can be obtained at a certain time step in this study the generalized minimal residual gmres iterative scheme saad and schultz 1986 with a diagonal preconditioner is applied to the solution of the system of equations which is proved more efficient compared with other algebraic equation solvers from the solution of the above boundary value problem and the corresponding boundary conditions the potential φ s and its normal derivative φ s n on boundaries of the whole fluid domain are all known the particle velocity components φ s both on the free surface and body surface can be simply obtained by the following formula 28 φ s x φ s y φ s z x ζ y ζ z ζ x ς y ς z ς n x n y n z 1 φ s ζ φ s ς φ s n where n x n y n z are the components of the unit normal vector n defined as 29 n n x n y n z 1 j x ζ x ς in which j denotes the magnitude of the normal vector and denotes a cross product the derivatives of x x y z and φ s with regard to ζ and ς in eqs 28 and 29 can be directly obtained through differentiation of the shape function within the surface element based on eq 19 it is noted that there are usually more than one element connected to a node thus the final velocity components at each node are obtained by averaging the values from eq 28 evaluated within every element surrounding this node 2 3 hydrodynamic forces and body motions once the velocity potential and its spatial derivatives have been solved at each time step the pressure on the body surface can be obtained by using the bernoulli s equation 30 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z thus the hydrodynamic forces f f 1 f 2 f 3 and moments m f 4 f 5 f 6 can subsequently be obtained by integrating the pressure over the wetted body surface the integrals over the exact wetted body surface s b are split into two parts one is over the wetted body surface s b w defined as the intersection of its boundary with the incident wave profile the other is transformed into the waterline integrals by taylor expansion at the incident wave elevation z η i x y t i e 31 f i s b p n i d s ρ s b w φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z n i d s ρ γ η s φ t 1 2 φ 2 1 2 g 2 η i η s η s 2 n i d l where ρ is the fluid density n i are the six components of the generalized unit normal vector n 1 n 2 n 3 n and n 4 n 5 n 6 r b n it should be noted that the velocity components φ on the body surface in eq 31 can be obtained numerically as mentioned above however it is rather difficult to calculate the time derivative of velocity potential φ t accurately especially in the case of freely moving bodies this is very crucial to obtain the correct pressure and hydrodynamic forces on the body surface to deal with it there are several ways to obtain φ t in the literature so far in the present study both a new kind of backward difference method with the consideration of grid motion and the indirect method wu and eatock taylor 1996 2003 are applied and these two independent results are cross checked for verification in the new kind of backward difference method by utilizing the time derivative operator δ δ t t v mesh the time derivative of velocity potential φ t can be written as 32 φ t φ i t φ s t φ i t δ φ s δ t v mesh φ s where v mesh is the mesh velocity on the body surface and δ φ s δ t can be obtained by a backward difference scheme utilizing the velocity potential of the present and previous time steps as for the indirect method the details of the derivation can be referred to wu and eatock taylor 1996 2003 and thus are not elaborated here in this way the hydrodynamic forces on the body can be indirectly obtained by using some auxiliary functions without the knowledge of the body surface pressure for floating bodies the equation of motion for a rigid body can be written as 33 j 1 6 m i j ξ j b i j ξ j k i j ξ j f i m g δ i 3 where m i j k i j and b i j are coefficients of the mass matrix the stiffness matrix and the damping matrix respectively as we known the overall damping level contains the structural damping and hydrodynamic damping which is very difficult to be accurately determined thus for simplification a linearized damping matrix is introduced in the calculation which contains the structural damping and the viscous damping neglected in the potential theory in this study the damping matrix is constructed by rayleigh damping based on the following formula b i i α i m i i where α i 2 ζ i ω n i is the damping coefficient ζ i and ω n i are the damping ratio and natural frequency of the body in the ith mode of motion other terms in the damping matrix are set to zero 3 numerical implementation 3 1 initial mesh generation in the present method we discretize the boundary integral equations by using quadratic boundary elements in this section we consider how the element mesh is established first we note that in general the whole boundary is not a smooth and continuous surface there are many corners and edges e g at the intersection of the free surface and the body surface in order to deal with this the discretized surface is divided into some simple continuous patches and initial mesh generation is performed on each of them as the hobem is used the node can be located at the corners or edges of the boundary surfaces and this will result in a singularity where the normal vectors at these points are undefined to deal with this a double or triple node is employed at the edges or corners so that we can place two or three different nodes at one spatial position to represent the different normal vectors for simple and regular boundaries structured quadrilateral meshes are adopted to discretize them and unstructured triangular meshes may be particularly suited to discretizing complex boundaries on the free surface as previously presented we can generate a finer mesh close to the body and a coarser mesh far from it fig 2 gives the illustration of an initial computational mesh generated by the above method for wave interaction with a monopile 3 2 time stepping scheme after solving the above boundary value problem and obtaining the fluid velocities on the free surface the free surface geometry and velocity potential are updated for the computation at the next time step by the time integral of the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions here the standard 4th order runge kutta rk4 time integration scheme with the ale approach is adopted providing good stability and accuracy at the beginning of the numerical simulation an abrupt initial condition should be avoided thus a ramp function is imposed to modulate the incident wave field so that the incident wave can smoothly develop from the calm water surface to the specified wave field it allows the numerical simulation to be more stable and to reach a steady state earlier a cosine ramp function r m is adopted in this paper as 34 r m 1 2 1 cos π t t m t t m 1 t t m where t m is the transition period here chosen as 2t with t the characteristic wave period 3 3 mesh deformation and interpolation the geometry of the computational domain varies with the elevation of the incident free surface and the exact position of the body as a result it is necessary to adjust the mesh at each time step in the light of these deformations in order to avoid remeshing the entire domain at each time step mesh deformation algorithms have been integrated with the ale approach so that it is possible to achieve a good quality of the mesh and keep the same mesh topology during the deformation in this study two mesh deformation algorithms are implemented a spring analogy method blom 2000 is used to update the mesh on the wetted body surface this method is common and can be adapted to an arbitrary geometry in the 3d domain however it requires the solution of a large scale system of linear equations whose size is approximately as large as the total number of grid nodes and hence can be very time consuming when the number of computational grids is quite large thus as an alternative an interpolation scheme based on radial basis functions rbfs presented by de boer et al 2007 is adopted here for the mesh deformation on the free surface for simplicity the free surface nodes are firstly projected onto the horizontal plane and then moved using the rbf interpolation method in this plane which results in the horizontal coordinates i e x and y of new nodes the interpolation function s x which describes the horizontal displacement of all free surface nodes can be expressed by a sum of basis functions 35 s x j 1 n b α j ψ x x b j p x where n b is the number of nodes on the boundary ψ is a given rbf with respect to the euclidean distance x x b j x b j y b j are the horizontal coordinates of boundary nodes for which the displacements are known and p is a linear polynomial the coefficients α j and the polynomial p are determined by the interpolation conditions and the additional requirements 36 s x b j d b j 37 j 1 n b α j q x b j 0 where d b contains the known discrete values of the displacement at the boundary nodes and q is a polynomial with a degree less than or equal to that of polynomial p these conditions can be expressed in the following system of linear algebra equations 38 m p p t 0 α β d b 0 where m is an n b n b matrix defined from the radial basis function m i j ψ x b i x b j p is an n b 3 matrix with row j given by 1 x b j y b j α is the vector consisting of the coefficients α j j 1 n b and β contains the coefficients of the linear polynomial p i e β j j 1 3 after solving the system of linear algebra equations and obtaining the interpolation coefficients the displacement of internal nodes on the free surface d in can then be derived by interpolation based on eq 35 as 39 d in s x i n the prominent advantages of this rbf interpolation method may be listed as follows firstly the method is quite efficient since it leads to a considerable reduction of computational efforts it is noted that the size of the linear system to be solved in eq 38 is equal to n b 3 n b 3 which is much smaller than that in mesh connectivity schemes such as the spring analogy method blom 2000 and laplacian smoothing technique bai and eatock taylor 2006 the size of the linear system encountered there is approximately as large as n in n in with n in the total number of grid nodes the total number of grid nodes is generally one or two order of magnitude higher than the number of boundary nodes in addition this rbf interpolation method is straightforward to implement since each node is moved individually by evaluating the displacement function according to its position in space which means no information about the mesh connectivity is required further it has been demonstrated that the method could maintain high mesh quality even for large mesh deformations in the literature e g de boer et al 2007 there are various rbfs available for the interpolation scheme nevertheless a proper rbf needs to be chosen since the robustness of the method is not the same for all rbfs in this study many rbfs have been tested and a thin plate spline ψ r r 2 ln r is chosen because it is found to be the best compromise between the resulting mesh quality robustness and computation time according to the resulting displacement s x the horizontal velocity components of the free surface nodes can be easily obtained by the finite difference scheme as for the vertical component of the node velocity an additional condition should be imposed to ensure that the node on the free surface remains on this interface i e 40 v mesh n φ i n on the basis of the horizontal coordinates of new nodes on the free surface obtained by the above mesh deformation algorithm the vertical position and velocity potential at the new node can be calculated by interpolation in the interpolation we must firstly find which old element the new node belongs to to find the corresponding old element the following criterion is adopted 41 l 1 n s sub l s ele where s sub is the area of a triangular sub element that is composed of the considered new node and two adjacent vertices of the old element s ele is the area of the old element and n is the number of triangular sub elements around the new node provided that eq 41 is satisfied the node must be within the corresponding element n then the local intrinsic coordinates ζ ς of the node can be determined based on the following simultaneous polynomial equations 42 x i k 1 k h k ζ ς x k n 0 y i k 1 k h k ζ ς y k n 0 the above system of nonlinear equations is solved iteratively by using the newton raphson method grilli et al 2001 finally the scattered wave elevation η s and velocity potential φ s at the new node can be obtained by utilizing the shape function within this old element 3 4 smoothing techniques it is well known that the so called saw tooth instability may occur on the free surface during the numerical simulation of strongly nonlinear waves which is also a common issue in the time domain analysis of nonlinear wave structure interaction many smoothing techniques have been developed to remove this numerical instability most of which are achieved through an interpolation scheme from adjacent nodes for structured grids fewer approaches have been developed so far for unstructured meshes in this study a chebyshev 5 point smoothing technique of longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 is used on the waterline nodes in addition a generalized 3 point low pass filter outlined by shao and faltinsen 2014b is applied elsewhere this low pass filter is a generalization of a 3 point interpolation scheme i e 43 f i 1 c f i c j 1 n i w i j f j where f i and f i are the values at the ith node before and after smoothing respectively they could be the scattered wave elevation η s or the velocity potential φ s here c is the strength of the filter f j j 1 n i is the value at the jth adjacent node and w ij is the weighting coefficient defined as 44 w i j l i j 2 j 1 n i l i j 2 where l ij is the distance between the selected ith node and the jth adjacent node n i is the number of adjacent nodes surrounding the ith node note that the proposed smoothing is only required when the local wave slope is very steep in the following calculations and it is typically applied at every 5 time steps to limit its influence on the accuracy of numerical solutions 3 5 numerical computation process in order to briefly summarize the contents of the above sections a flow chart is added here to clarify the numerical computation process as shown in fig 3 4 overview of the fourier and wavelet transforms when a steady state has been achieved during the simulation and the numerical results become periodic with time the amplitude of each harmonic component of wave forces or other time signals can be obtained by fourier analysis as the most classical signal processing analysis method the fourier transform ft is widely used in the processing of stationary signals with the use of the fast fourier transform fft technique frigo and johnson 1998 it becomes an extremely rapid method of transforming a time domain signal into its frequency content as 45 x f x t e i 2 π f t d t where x t denotes a signal in the time domain e g the time series of wave forces or motion responses and x f is its fourier transform that describes the frequency spectrum of the signal however the fourier transform ft has a notable limitation since it assumes that a signal is either infinite in duration or periodic over all time and thus the frequency content of the signal is stationary and does not change over time consequently any non stationarity will be simulated by the inclusion of pseudo harmonics that appear as a spread of energy without obvious physical meaning in addition the ft merely provides the frequency content of the signal but the information on the time localization of the frequency components is essentially lost in the process this limitation can be overcome to a certain extent by applying the wavelet transform wt the main characteristic of the wt is the dual localization property both in the time domain and in the frequency domain as well as its adaptive time frequency resolution which enables the wt to be more suitable for non stationary or transient signal analysis compared with the ft generally the wavelet transform wt of the signal x t is defined as the convolution of x t with a family of shifted and scaled versions of the mother wavelet ψ t 46 w t τ s 1 s x t ψ t τ s d t where the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate τ is the translation parameter corresponding to the position of the wavelet as it is shifted through the time domain signal and s is the scale dilation parameter determining the width of the wavelet the wavelet coefficient w t τ s which is in terms of the time scale functions represents the correlation between the wavelet and a localized section of the signal in this study the complex morlet wavelet is adopted as the mother wavelet which is one of the most extensively used mother wavelets the expression of the morlet wavelet is given as 47 ψ t 1 2 π e t 2 2 e i ω 0 t which represents a plane sinusoidal wave of frequency ω 0 modulated by a gaussian envelope of the unit width following the method of massel 2001 the relationship between the wavelet scale and the equivalent fourier period can be analytically derived for a particular wavelet function for the morlet wavelet the relation can be given as 48 s n ω 0 ω 0 2 2 4 π 1 f n α 1 f n setting ω 0 2 π yields that the constant α 1 0125 and thus the scale s n is approximately equal to the inverse of the frequency f n in this paper the fast fourier transform fft technique is adopted to obtain the amplitude of each harmonic component of wave forces in regular wave cases and the continuous wavelet transform cwt is adopted to obtain the wavelet spectrum in the time frequency domain for analyzing the ringing response of a monopile in focused waves 5 numerical results and discussion 5 1 convergence study in the convergence tests nonlinear wave diffraction around a bottom mounted vertical cylinder in regular waves is investigated here the case of kr 0 245 ka 0 19 and d r 10 0 is selected where k is the wavenumber r the radius of the cylinder d the water depth and a is half of the wave height which corresponds to the long wave regime and moderately steep wave events in finite water depth in the following calculations the stream function model of rienecker and fenton 1981 is utilized to simulate nonlinear regular incident waves the convergence study of computational grids is firstly implemented with three different meshes these meshes are labelled as mesh a b and c respectively and their basic parameters are shown in table 1 on the free surface the radius of the computational domain is chosen as r d 2 λ where λ is the linear characteristic wavelength an annulus damping zone over a distance of one wavelength is applied on the outer region of the computational domain the radial length of the free surface element gradually increases towards the outer boundary since only the solutions of φ s and η s need to be solved in this study and the scattered waves decay with the increase of the distance from the body this leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort fig 4 a and b show the time series of wave run up at the front of the cylinder and horizontal force on the cylinder using these three meshes respectively it appears that the numerical calculation can converge quickly and the results obtained with mesh b are almost identical with those obtained with mesh c the error analysis of the first three harmonic amplitudes of horizontal force is also presented in table 2 in the table f x b i f x c i f x c i denotes the relative error of the results obtained with mesh b and mesh c where the superscript i indicates the ith harmonic it can be seen that the relative error is all less than 2 0 for each harmonic component afterwards the convergence test is carried out with regard to different time steps using δ t t 50 t 80 and t 100 and the similar convergence can be found it appears that the results with mesh b and δ t t 80 are sufficiently accurate based on the convergence study fig 5 shows the comparison of the backward difference method and the indirect method in calculating wave forces it appears that there is almost no difference between these two independent results as a result the accuracy of both methods is verified through the comparison in addition the numerical results show that the steady state is reached shortly after the transition period and can last for a very long time which indicates that the damping layer is effective and no significant waves are reflected from the far truncated boundary therefore the proposed numerical model is applicable for a long time simulation of wave structure interaction problems 5 2 wave run up profile around a vertical cylinder in order to check the accuracy of the proposed numerical model the wave run up around a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder is firstly investigated by comparison with a series of experimental data obtained by kriebel 1992 fig 6 shows the wave run up profile around the vertical cylinder with kr 0 308 and kd 0 853 in this case two different wave heights are applied in terms of ka 0 091 and ka 0 125 where a denotes the incident wave amplitude defined as half of the wave height in the figure θ denotes the azimuthal angle around the cylinder and θ 0 and θ 180 are corresponding to the downwave side and upwave side respectively the wave run up profile consists of the maximum wave elevation at each location along the circumferential direction which is obtained from the steady state part of the results as shown in fig 6 the present numerical results are compared with the linear theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 the second order theory and the experimental data kriebel 1992 in general it can be seen that significant nonlinear diffraction effects are present in this test case and the linear theory poorly predicts the wave run up distributions around the circumference of the cylinder from the comparison it can be seen that the linear theory markedly underestimates the maximum wave run up at the front of the cylinder relative error of about 29 for ka 0 091 and 38 for ka 0 125 nevertheless the present results agree well with the experimental data and even generally capture the higher order effects that are not part of the second order theory on the upwave side of the cylinder it is noted that the present model provides a more reasonable estimation of the maximum wave run up than the second order theory on the downwave side the present model predicts a substantial localized recovery of the wave elevation in this area due to nonlinear diffraction although the predicted value of maximum wave run up at the rear of the cylinder seems larger compared with the experimental data in addition as shown in fig 7 similar conclusions are applicable to another case with kr 0 374 and kd 1 036 in the case two different wave heights corresponding to ka 0 1025 and ka 0 143 are adopted it is notable that higher order nonlinear effects superior than 2nd order play a certain role in the wave diffraction around the cylinder clear differences can be observed between the second order results and the experimental data as the wave steepness increases these higher order effects are correctly captured by the present model on the upwave side of the cylinder θ π 3 nevertheless on the downwave side some significant differences between the present results and the experimental data are observed this is perhaps due to the fact that the proposed numerical model based on the weak scatterer approximation may not include all nonlinearities of wave structure interactions since only the interactions between incident waves and scattered waves are taken into consideration while the interactions between scattered waves are neglected which can be crucial on the downwave side flow separation and viscous effects may also play a certain role in the results of wave run up at the rear of the cylinder 5 3 higher harmonic wave forces on a vertical cylinder in this section a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder in nonlinear regular waves is investigated to further verify the proposed model with regard to the higher harmonic wave forces on offshore structures a relatively comprehensive investigation is provided with respect to a series of non dimensional wavenumbers or cylinder sizes kr from 0 166 to 0 378 the ratio between the water depth d and the cylinder radius r applied in the numerical calculations is set to d r 10 three different wave steepnesses are considered to investigate the effects of nonlinearity including ka 0 10 0 15 and 0 19 in this study the time series of the horizontal force on the vertical cylinder is firstly computed and then the fourier analysis over 10 wave periods is implemented when the steady state has been reached the amplitude of the nth harmonic horizontal force is normalized by ρ g a n r 3 n as did in huseby and grue 2000 the non dimensional amplitudes of the first second and third harmonic components of the horizontal force are shown in figs 8 10 respectively in general the present numerical results of the first and second harmonic wave forces are consistent with the solutions obtained from the linear and second order frequency domain potential flow solvers i e wafdut teng and eatock taylor 1995 and qtfdut teng et al 1999 for small ka conditions more specifically the non dimensional first harmonic force increases with the increase of the cylinder size kr up to a certain point and then decreases with further increasing the cylinder size as shown in fig 8 in addition it appears that for all cylinder sizes investigated here the present non dimensional results of the first harmonic force are nearly constant for these three different wave steepnesses even when ka becomes rather large by using the inertia term in the morison equation an estimation of the first harmonic force is also provided in fig 8 it can be seen that the morison inertia term with an inertia coefficient of two c m 2 0 predicts the first harmonic force quite well for a smaller cylinder size kr 0 5 while failing to provide a good estimation of wave force for a larger cylinder size nevertheless as shown in fig 9 the non dimensional second harmonic force decreases rapidly with the increase of the cylinder size and reaches a minimum at about kr 0 4 good agreement is achieved between the present numerical results and the second order frequency domain results for small and moderate ka conditions whereas clear differences are observed as the wave steepness further increases furthermore it appears that the present non dimensional results of the second harmonic force gradually decrease with the increase of wave steepness which is similar with the experimental observations of huseby and grue 2000 it is noted that the third and higher harmonic forces are extremely small compared with the total force when the wave steepness is small as a result for small ka conditions it is quite difficult to accurately extract the higher harmonic components from the time series through fourier analysis thus for the third harmonic wave force only the numerical results with ka 0 19 are presented in fig 10 furthermore the non dimensional theoretical solutions of faltinsen et al 1995 referred to as fnv and malenica and molin 1995 are shown in terms of a solid and a dashed line respectively and both of which are irrelevant to a r if kr is determined the fnv theory is analytically derived in infinite water depth and thus independent of the d r ratio the solution of malenica and molin 1995 is obtained based on a complete third order diffraction theory in finite water depth and the selected results provided in the original paper with d r 10 are included here for reference the cfd results paulsen et al 2012 with the same d r ratio as well as the experimental data huseby and grue 2000 for the deep water case with ka 0 19 are also shown in fig 10 for comparison it can be seen that a satisfactory agreement between the present numerical results and theoretical solutions is achieved for kr 0 25 for larger values of kr the present results of the third harmonic force are somewhat smaller than the solutions from the above theoretical models whereas they have a good agreement with the experimental data of huseby and grue 2000 the similar discrepancy between the experimental data and theoretical solutions can also be observed in kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 particularly for large ka conditions the discrepancy in the third harmonic force was demonstrated to be due to flow separation effects and clearly related to the keulegan carpenter kc number furthermore it appears that the discrepancy increases gradually with the increase of wave steepness to further verify the proposed model and explain the discrepancy with regard to the higher harmonic wave forces on a vertical cylinder in the condition of longer waves and finite water depth two sets of test cases corresponding to kr 0 127 and 0 105 are selected and simulated for a range of wave steepness ka the ratio between the water depth d and the cylinder radius r is set to d r 7 83 to be consistent with the experiments of kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 the first three harmonics of the horizontal wave force are presented versus the generalized fnv theory and published experimental data kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 as a function of wave steepness ka the amplitude of each harmonic of the horizontal force is normalized by ρ g r 3 as did in kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 fig 11 shows the amplitudes of the first three harmonics with kr 0 127 and d r 7 83 it can be seen that for each harmonic component the present numerical results all have a quite reasonable agreement with the fnv theory and experimental data for small to medium wave steepness up to approximately ka 0 12 nevertheless there is a gradual increase in discrepancy with increasing wave steepness particularly in the third harmonic of the horizontal force similar phenomena and discrepancies can also be observed in fig 12 for longer waves with kr 0 105 and d r 7 83 furthermore it is noted that there are numerical stability issues with steeper wave conditions although some smoothing techniques have been utilized in the numerical model and thus the accuracy of the numerical results cannot be guaranteed in these conditions one must acknowledge that viscous flow separation effects might be dominant once the wave conditions reach certain kc numbers which is corresponding to kc 3 5 4 0 and above in these two cases and then the present numerical model begins to break down inevitably the snapshots of the free surface for a couple of these cases are also presented figs 13 and 14 show the contour maps of the free surface elevation in the vicinity of the cylinder with kr 0 127 ka 0 15 and kr 0 105 ka 0 126 respectively 5 4 ringing response of a monopile in focused waves a build up of resonant motion is illustrated with the model of a rigid monopile mounted to a hinge joint on a base plate at the tank floor which is similar with the layout in the experiments of chaplin et al 1997 and riise et al 2018 as shown in fig 15 the rigid monopile is hinged at the bottom and supported at the top with springs in the horizontal plane which can only rotate in the pitch mode of motion with an angle θ t as a simplification it can be represented as an idealized single degree of freedom elastic system main structural and mechanical parameters of the monopile are outlined in table 3 on the basis of the linear equation of undamped free motion in the frequency domain the natural frequency of the monopile in the pitch mode of motion can be estimated as 49 ω n 5 k 55 c 55 m 55 a 55 ω n 5 where m 55 a 55 k 55 and c 55 are coefficients of the mass the added mass the stiffness and the hydrostatic restoring matrix in the pitch mode of motion respectively the added mass a 55 is a function of frequency thus the natural frequency of the monopile is obtained through iterations in the present study a two dimensional focused wave model is adopted to simulate large transient wave events the use of focused wave groups overcomes some shortcomings of regular incident waves i e the lack of a proper representation of the random and broadband properties of ocean waves in realistic sea states in this model using the technique of multi frequency focusing a specified range of wave components are generated and their relative phases are adjusted so that at one instant in time all the discrete wave components may be focused at a specific spatial position in this way a large wave crest elevation is produced due to constructive interference the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 ning et al 2009 is adopted to obtain the expressions of the incident surface elevation and velocity potential i e η i and φ i for focused wave groups they are expressed in the following forms 50 η i η i 1 η i 2 51 φ i φ i 1 φ i 2 where η i 1 and φ i 1 are the linear wave elevation and velocity potential of incident waves and η i 2 and φ i 2 are the corresponding second order wave elevation and velocity potential respectively within the framework of linear theory the water surface elevation of a focused wave group can be written as 52 η i 1 x t i 1 n a i cos k i x x f ω i t t f where n is the total number of discrete wave components and a i k i and ω i denote the amplitude the wavenumber and the angular frequency of the ith wave component respectively x f and t f are the specified focal position and focusing time respectively and both of them are assumed to be equal to zero i e x f 0 and t f 0 in this paper in addition considering the nonlinear wave wave interactions the second order wave elevation is expressed as 53 η i 2 x t i 1 n j i n a i a j h ω i ω j cos k i k j x x f ω i ω j t t f 1 2 i 1 n a i 2 h ω i ω i cos 2 k i x x f ω i t t f where h ω i ω j denote the second order wave wave interaction coefficients corresponding to the sum and difference frequency terms the specific expression of h ω i ω j can be referred to dalzell 1999 and ning et al 2009 and thus is not elaborated here the corresponding linear and second order velocity potentials can also be obtained in a similar manner to obtain realistic modeling of an extreme wave event the amplitude spectrum of discrete wave components can be determined by the newwave model tromans et al 1991 as 54 a i a s ω i δ ω i i 1 n s ω i δ ω i in which a is the linear sum of the component wave amplitudes s ω i is the underlying frequency spectrum and δ ω i is the frequency spacing the discrete frequency component ω i is uniformly spaced over the frequency band ω 1 ω n and the frequency bandwidth is defined as 55 δ ω ω n ω 1 in this section ringing response of a bottom hinged monopile in focused wave groups is investigated the underlying wave components are obtained based on the jonswap spectrum goda 1999 with the peak enhancement factor of γ 3 3 where the wave energy is mainly concentrated near the spectral peak frequency in order to highlight the third harmonic resonance of the monopile in pitch motion the peak frequency of the incident focused wave groups is set to near one third of the natural frequency i e ω p ω n 5 3 0 1 49 rad s thus the non dimensional cylinder size k p r is equal to about 0 25 where k p is the wavenumber corresponding to the peak frequency ω p and three different input wave amplitudes are considered to investigate the effects of nonlinearity including a r 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 note that the value of k p r is relatively small typically 0 10 0 30 and the input wave amplitude is comparable to the radius of the monopile i e a r 1 0 this corresponds to the field conditions where the ringing response is expected to occur the vertical axis of the monopile is located at the focal position of the incident wave groups and the monopile is hinged at a lateral axis at the level of 5 m below the still water level i e z 5 0 m with a water depth of d 6 0 m the normalized power spectrum of incoming waves with ω p 1 49 rad s and γ 3 3 used in the numerical simulation is shown in fig 16 considering that the jonswap spectrum is narrow banded and most of the wave energy is concentrated near the peak frequency the frequency band ranging from 0 8 to 2 4 rad s is adopted numerical convergence test is firstly carried out on the number of wave components as an example fig 17 a shows the time series of the incident wave elevation at the focal position for different numbers of wave components n 20 40 and 60 with a r 1 0 and the comparison of corresponding amplitude spectra is presented in fig 17 b from the figures it appears that the numerical results are nearly identical for the latter two cases indicating that the convergence of the incident wave groups is achieved using n 40 as a result the incoming wave parameters outlined in table 4 are used in the following numerical calculations afterwards convergence tests of mesh size and time step have also been carried out in addition the peak wavelength λ p and the peak period t p are selected as the measurement of mesh size and time step respectively in the following calculations the appropriate computational grids have been chosen as outlined in section 5 1 and the numerical results have been proved to be convergent based on the convergence tests using computational grids with different resolutions in addition several time steps have been tested and δ t t p 100 is found to be sufficiently accurate for each of the cases discussed below in this study the time series of the pitch moment and response of the monopile are firstly provided and then the wavelet analysis is implemented for analyzing the time frequency characteristic of the ringing response furthermore the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response of the monopile are discussed respectively 5 4 1 effects of peak frequency in this section the effects of the peak frequency of incoming waves on the ringing response of the monopile are firstly investigated a range of peak frequencies ω p from 1 37 to 1 61 rad s with an increment of 0 06 rad s are chosen numerical calculations are implemented with the same input wave amplitude a r 1 0 the time series of the non dimensional pitch response of the monopile with ω p 1 37 1 49 and 1 61 rad s are shown in fig 18 a c respectively the corresponding amplitude spectra of pitch response for these three peak frequencies are shown in fig 19 which are obtained by fourier analysis over 20 peak periods 10t p before the focusing time and 10t p after the focusing time with a hanning window it can be seen from fig 17 b that the second harmonic component of incoming waves with ω p 1 49 rad s is much less than the first one and the third or higher harmonic components can nearly be neglected however as shown in fig 18 b the third harmonic pitch motion is still quite obvious the similar trend is also applicable to the conditions of other peak frequencies three oscillations within each characteristic period t p can be clearly observed after the focusing time t f 0 which is close related to the nonlinear wave structure interaction and the relationship between the peak frequency of incoming waves and the natural frequency of the monopile in pitch motion further when the peak frequency ω p is away from 1 49 rad s i e one third of the natural frequency the amplitude of the third harmonic pitch response appears to be reduced as shown in fig 19 all these indicate that the third harmonic resonance response will occur provided that the peak frequency of incoming waves is close to one third of the natural frequency similarly the fourth fifth and even higher harmonic resonance response may also be induced when the wave steepness is quite large or even breaking as a result the phenomenon of ringing should be noted in the practical design and it is necessary to avoid the high order wave frequency being right around the natural frequency of the monopile as far as possible 5 4 2 effects of input wave amplitude in this section the effects of input wave amplitude on the ringing response are investigated the peak frequency of incoming waves is maintained as ω p ω n 5 3 0 1 49 rad s figs 20 and 21 show the pitch moment and response of the monopile with different input wave amplitudes i e a r 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 respectively according to the linear theory the numerical results should be irrelevant to the input wave amplitude when they are normalized by a therefore any distinction between the normalized numerical results with different values of a r is due to nonlinear effects it can be seen from fig 21 that the effects of nonlinearity become significant and the higher harmonic components gradually dominate the pitch response as the input wave amplitude increases three oscillations within each characteristic period t p can be clearly observed in the pitch response when a r 0 8 and 1 0 which bursts shortly after the focusing time and lasts for several peak periods this suggests that the ringing response occurs immediately after the maximum crest of focused wave groups passing through the location of the monopile further the corresponding wavelet spectra of pitch response with a r 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 are shown in fig 22 the color bar in the figure indicates the magnitude of the normalized pitch response for a given time and frequency i e the modulus of the wavelet coefficient w t τ s in this way the effect of input wave amplitude on the pitch response can be seen more clearly through analyzing the time frequency characteristic of the response as expected the frequency components of pitch response contain the first harmonic component within the input frequency range 0 8 f f p 1 6 and the higher harmonic components f f p 1 6 due to nonlinear wave wave and wave structure interactions it can be seen clearly that when a r 0 6 the pitch response is dominated by the first harmonic component and the higher harmonic components are fairly small nevertheless when a r 0 8 and 1 0 the third harmonic component approximately f f p 3 appears to be quite significant after the focusing time and lasts for several peak periods as shown in fig 22 b and c it can be seen that the magnitude of the third harmonic component is almost as large as the first harmonic component in the condition of a r 1 0 actually since the peak frequency of incoming waves is set to around one third of the natural frequency the third harmonic component will lead to the resonant response of the monopile in pitch motion provided that the input wave amplitude is sufficiently large and damping ratio is slight 5 4 3 effects of damping ratio it has been presented by davies et al 1994 that the ringing response is insensitive to the damping level to investigate that three different damping ratios ζ 1 2 5 are applied in this section the small damping ratio implies a lightly damped vibration system that is associated with monopile support structures for offshore wind turbines as suggested by kallehave et al 2015 the pitch moment and response for different damping ratios with ω p 1 49 rad s and a r 1 0 are shown in figs 23 and 24 respectively it appears that the magnitude of damping ratio has slight influence on the peak value of pitch responses however the larger damping ratio leads to a faster decay of the resonant response after the peak further fig 25 a and b as well as fig 22 c show the corresponding wavelet spectra of pitch response for these three damping ratios ζ 1 2 5 it can be seen clearly that the variation of the first and second harmonic components is almost negligible with varying damping ratios however when a larger damping ratio is adopted the amplitude of the third harmonic component significantly reduces and it decays more rapidly after the peak value this indicates that the damping ratio has prominent effects on the third harmonic resonance of the monopile in pitch motion studied in this paper furthermore it is noted that the higher harmonic components play an important role in the response particularly in the condition of large input wave amplitude and small damping ratio as shown in fig 25 a consequently the ringing response induced by the higher harmonic wave loads should be noted in the practical design and operation of a monopile for offshore wind turbines 6 conclusions in this paper a time domain nonlinear potential flow model is developed based on the weak scatterer approximation the higher order boundary element method hobem is employed to solve the corresponding boundary value problem at each time step in the time marching process the 4th order runge kutta time integration scheme with an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted on the free surface the proposed model is verified by a series of nonlinear wave diffraction problems in regular waves it appears that in terms of the wave run up and higher harmonic wave forces the present results are all in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical solutions and experimental results furthermore it appears to be notable that higher order effects play a certain role in the simulation of such phenomenon the ringing response of a monopile exposed to moderately steep focused waves is subsequently investigated for several different wave conditions the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response are discussed further the wavelet analysis is implemented for analyzing the time frequency characteristic of the ringing response it is noted that the third harmonic resonance response will occur if the peak frequency of incoming waves is close to one third of the natural frequency and the higher harmonic components are essential for accurate prediction of the response particularly in the condition of large input wave amplitude and small damping ratio consequently the ringing response induced by the higher harmonic wave loads should be noted in the practical design and operation of a monopile for offshore wind turbines the present numerical model has shown its ability to deal with the interaction between moderately steep waves and offshore structures no matter in the aspect of accuracy or robustness provided that the weak scatterer hypothesis may be well satisfied present study can also be extended to the nonlinear seakeeping analysis of ships and hydrodynamic performance evaluation of point absorber wave energy converters in order to consider more complex sea states e g nonlinear irregular waves with possible directional spreading it may be worthwhile to combine the present numerical model with a high order

introduction in offshore and ocean engineering high frequency wave loads occurring in steep wave conditions have been identified since the 1990s the high frequency wave loads are typically excited on gravity based platforms gbss and tension leg platforms tlps and they may generate a rapid build up of vibrations at the resonance frequency of the lightly damped offshore structure grue 2002 the phenomenon of the high frequency resonant response is so called ringing due to its sudden appearance and much slower decay unlike springing ringing usually occurs during the passage of steep wave crests and can generate fairly high levels of stress within a burst of only a few oscillations this phenomenon has been widely studied by the oil and gas industry from the 1990s and it has been observed both in the model tests and field conditions as shown in the ringing report stansberg 1993 ringing may also occur in offshore wind turbine foundations which has recently been a hotspot issue since ringing induced loads may be relevant to extreme loads and fatigue however these cannot be well modeled by classical analysis tools such as the linear and second order wave diffraction radiation models based on the perturbation expansion method proper and efficient numerical models of predicting these loads and responses are still lacking a range of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out with regard to the phenomenon of ringing the experimental studies have been implemented in wave tanks or wave basins with incoming focused wave groups grue et al 1993 chaplin et al 1997 scolan et al 1997 zang et al 2010 steep random waves stansberg et al 1995 bachynski et al 2017 riise et al 2018 and periodic waves huseby and grue 2000 kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 the main focus of the theoretical studies has been to capture the wave forces up to the third harmonic component in regular waves such as the theory of faltinsen et al 1995 referred to as the fnv theory and the solution of malenica and molin 1995 the original fnv theory was firstly obtained for the case of regular incident waves in deep water and secondly generalized by newman 1996 to irregular waves the first three harmonics of the horizontal wave force on a slender surface piercing vertical cylinder were formulated based on a third order perturbation analysis in the long wave regime the solution of malenica and molin 1995 was derived based on a complete third order diffraction theory in finite water depth which could capture the third harmonic force in regular waves by complicated integrals of the first second and third order velocity potentials however the approach is only applicable to the wave diffraction of vertical cylinders in regular waves with small steepness and too difficult to extend to the actual irregular sea states in view of the simplification of these approaches neither of these theoretical studies involves the condition of steep transient waves or breaking waves nor is the valid application range of the approaches clear even in regular waves some fully nonlinear potential flow models have also been proposed ferrant 1998 shao and faltinsen 2014a as well as the cfd models e g paulsen et al 2014 chen et al 2014 in recent years however both the fully nonlinear and cfd models are still time consuming for practical applications and present some weaknesses in terms of the remeshing algorithm and robustness for now theories and analysis models about the high frequency wave loads forces and moments and ringing responses in realistic sea states still have some drawbacks further wave load mechanisms are not fully understood particularly in steep transient waves the purpose of this study is to gain further insight into the modeling of steep wave impacts on offshore wind turbine foundations while maintaining a reasonable amount of computation time the monopile support structures are widely used in the offshore wind industry due to the simple yet robust design by comparison with other foundation concepts in the field conditions the diameter of the monopile is typically less than 8 m the first mode natural period is 3 5 s and the damping ratio is 1 4 kallehave et al 2015 while the typical peak period of the extreme sea state in the north sea is t p 15 s grue and huseby 2002 which is about three to five times longer than the resonance period of the structure in general the waves are moderately steep or even breaking when ringing occurs thus the wave height is comparable to the diameter of the monopile nevertheless the diameter of the monopile is relatively small compared with the characteristic wavelengths so that the diffraction effect of the structure in this phenomenon is generally slight as stated above a weakly nonlinear approach based on the weak scatterer approximation may be a promising alternative which was pioneered by pawlowski 1992 and then developed by kim and kim 2009 for nonlinear ship motions in this approach the scattered wave components due to the influence of the structure is assumed to be small with respect to the incident waves under this condition fully nonlinear free surface conditions can be linearized around the incident wave elevation this is advantageous for meshing algorithms since the geometry of the computational domain is known explicitly at every time step although it should be newly set up on the exact wetted body surface and incident free surface during the time marching process as a result this approach seems more robust and efficient than the fully nonlinear method despite the fact that a range of applications in offshore renewable energy industry also satisfy this condition particularly the monopile supported offshore wind turbines owts and point absorber wave energy converters wecs only a few numerical models have been developed using this class of approximation so far letournel et al 2014 2018 developed a weakly nonlinear model for submerged bodies and applied it to two submerged wecs the ceto and the waveroller the model was then extended to a surface piercing vertical cylinder in chauvigné et al 2015 in their numerical model the potential flow theory is adopted and the boundary value problem is solved by means of the boundary element method bem based on linear isoparametric triangular elements in this paper on the basis of the weak scatterer approximation a time domain nonlinear potential flow model is developed to deal with the interaction between moderately steep waves and surface piercing bodies the higher order boundary element method hobem is employed to solve the corresponding boundary value problem at each time step the 4th order runge kutta time integration scheme with an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian approach is adopted for the nonlinear free surface time marching process in addition two efficient algorithms have been integrated for dealing with mesh deformations so that the computational mesh can be adapted to the moving body surface and free surface geometry it is noted that the practical motivation of this study is to provide an improved numerical model for computing the higher harmonic wave loads and ringing response of offshore wind turbine foundations but the proposed model is also applicable to a range of other problems such as the nonlinear seakeeping analysis of ships and hydrodynamic performance evaluation of point absorber wave energy converters the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 and section 3 describe the mathematical formulation of the problem and the numerical implementation of the time domain nonlinear potential flow model in detail respectively a short overview of the fourier and wavelet transforms is given in section 4 for processing and analyzing the time domain results in section 5 numerical simulations are firstly conducted and verified for a series of nonlinear wave diffraction problems in regular waves and the comparisons with the theoretical solutions and published experimental results are provided in terms of the wave run up profile and higher harmonic wave forces on a bottom mounted vertical cylinder afterwards the ringing response of a bottom hinged monopile in focused wave groups is investigated for several different wave conditions in addition the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response are discussed respectively finally the main conclusions of the paper are summarized in section 6 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 weak scatterer approximation and boundary value problem we consider a three dimensional fluid domain ω bounded by a free surface s f a body surface s b and a flat bottom surface s d two right handed cartesian coordinate systems are defined as shown in fig 1 one is the space fixed coordinate system oxyz with the origin o on the mean water surface and its z axis pointing vertically upwards the other is the body fixed coordinate system o x y z the two sets of coordinate systems coincide with each other when the body is at its equilibrium position in this study a translational vector ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 is introduced to denote the displacements of surge sway and heave and a rotational vector θ α β γ ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 is introduced to denote the angles of roll pitch and yaw then the relationship between these two coordinate systems can be written as 1 x y z x r y r z r ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t x x r y y r z z r where x r x r y r z r is the center of rotation in the body fixed coordinate system t is the transformation matrix defined as ma 1998 2 t cos β cos γ cos β sin γ sin β sin α

fluid flow is irrotational within the framework of potential flow theory the fluid motion can be described by a velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace s equation within the fluid domain ω 3 2 φ 0 on the instantaneous free water surface s f the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are given as 4 η t φ z φ η 5 φ t g η 1 2 φ φ where η is the free surface elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration on the wetted body surface s b the boundary condition is based on the impermeability of the body surface and thus the normal velocity of the flow equals that of the body surface i e 6 φ n v n where n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain as shown in fig 1 and v is the velocity vector of a point on the body surface if a small angular motion is assumed the motion of a three dimensional rigid body can be described in terms of six components and the velocity of the body surface can be expressed as 7 v u ω r b where u ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 is the translational velocity ω ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 is the angular velocity and r b is the position vector of a point on the body surface relative to the center of rotation on other rigid boundaries e g s d the no flux neumann condition is applied as 8 φ n 0 for wave structure interaction problems it is efficient to make a nonlinear decomposition of the solution of the whole problem the total velocity potential and free surface elevation φ η are split into an incident component φ i η i and a scattered component φ s η s due to the influence of the structure inside the domain it is assumed that the scattered component is small with respect to the incident one which is the so called weak scatterer approximation pawlowski 1992 9 φ φ i φ s φ s φ i η η i η s η s η i in the present study φ i and η i are assumed to be known explicitly which can be obtained by a dedicated wave model e g a stream function model rienecker and fenton 1981 for regular waves and the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 ning et al 2009 or a high order spectral model ducrozet et al 2012 2016 for irregular waves as a result only the rest parts of the solution φ s and η s need to be solved this technique of separating an explicit solution from the total solution has been successfully applied to the nonlinear wave structure interaction by many researchers such as ferrant 1998 ferrant et al 2003 and ducrozet et al 2014 the advantages of this separating technique may be listed as follows firstly the incident waves are known explicitly based on a dedicated wave model without the effect of time and space discretization during the whole propagation secondly since the scattered waves that caused by the structure decay with the increase of the distance from the body we can use refined mesh close to the body of interest and relatively coarse mesh away from it this results in a considerable reduction of the problem size and computational effort during the solution of wave structure interaction without loss of accuracy in addition it offers a very convenient way to set the far field boundary condition for irregular sea states by setting all the scattered terms equal to zero at the control surface that is sufficiently far from the body an artificial damping layer is also adopted to ensure this condition which will be outlined in the following text on the basis of the weak scatterer approximation the kinematic and dynamic free surface conditions are linearized around the incident wave elevation z η i x y t using the first order taylor series expansion an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted to track the free surface nodes in the reference system linked to the incident free surface a particular time derivative operator is defined as 10 δ δ t t v mesh where v mesh is the mesh velocity on the incident free surface which is defined such as the free surface nodes follow the body in its horizontal motions and they follow the motion of the incident wave elevation vertically note that for a fixed surface piercing body the horizontal components of v mesh are set to zero for convenience leading to v mesh 0 0 η i t nevertheless for a floating body the calculation of v mesh will be introduced in section 3 3 applying the above flow decomposition and weak scatterer approximation into the free surface conditions leads to the following equations for the time derivative of η s and φ s 11 δ η s δ t φ s z φ i v mesh η s φ s η i η s 2 φ i z 2 η i φ i z ν r η s at z η i x y t 12 δ φ s δ t g η s φ i v mesh φ s η s z φ i t 1 2 φ i φ i ν r φ s at z η i x y t in these equations the terms involving φ i and η i can be considered as forcing terms evaluated by the incident wave model damping terms involving ν r have also been included r denotes the distance from the origin in the horizontal plane and they are used to model the absorbing beach to ensure that the scattered waves can gradually dissipate far from the body in this study the damping coefficient ν r is chosen as bai and eatock taylor 2006 13 ν r α 0 ω r r 0 β 0 λ 2 r 0 r r d r 0 β 0 λ 0 r r 0 where ω is the characteristic frequency of wave motion λ is a representative wavelength r d is the radius of the outer circular computational domain and two parameters α 0 and β 0 are used to control the strength of the damping layer and the width of the absorbing beach respectively these are both chosen to be 1 0 in the present study the velocity potential φ s satisfies the laplace s equation within the fluid domain and is subject to the neumann condition on the instantaneous wetted surface of the body 14 φ s n φ i n v n on s b for a fixed body the normal velocity of the body surface v n v n 0 and the scattered potential reduces to the diffraction potential in addition since the proposed problem is solved in the time domain an initial condition must also be imposed the initial conditions can be taken as 15 φ s 0 η s 0 at t 0 which are corresponding to the incident wave field without perturbation 2 2 higher order boundary element method the boundary integral equation method is used to solve the above nonlinear boundary value problem using green s second identity we can derive an integral equation for the scattered potential φ s over the whole boundary s as 16 α x 0 φ s x 0 s φ s x g x x 0 n g x x 0 φ s x n d s where x 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and x x y z are source and field points respectively α x 0 is the interior solid angle at the point x 0 and g x x 0 is the green s function for the cases in which the body and the simulated flow are symmetric about the x z plane and the seabed is horizontal the rankine source and its images with regard to the symmetry plane y 0 and the seabed z d can be adopted as the green s function thus only half of the computational domain is considered and the seabed surface is excluded under these conditions the green s function can be written as 17 g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 3 1 r 4 where 18 r 1 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 2 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 3 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 d 2 r 4 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 d 2 applying a dirichlet condition on the free surface and neumann conditions on the rest of the fluid boundary a mixed fredholm integral equation of the first kind on the free surface and of the second kind elsewhere is obtained the higher order boundary element method hobem is subsequently employed to solve the integral equation which is generally regarded as more efficient and accurate than the constant panel method in the method the boundary surface is discretized by quadratic isoparametric elements after the shape function h k ζ ς is introduced in each element the position coordinate the velocity potential and its derivatives within an element can be expressed in terms of nodal values the expressions of which are written as 19 x ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς x k φ s ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k φ s n ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k n where ζ ς denotes the local intrinsic coordinates x k φ s k and φ s k n are the nodal coordinates potentials and normal derivatives of the potential corresponding to the kth node in the quadratic isoparametric element k is the total number of nodes in the element i e eight and six for quadrilateral and triangular elements respectively an important numerical issue of the hobem is the evaluation of solid angle and cauchy principle value cpv integrals in the boundary integral equation in the present study the solid angle is directly calculated based on the method proposed by montic 1993 the cpv integrals are obtained by using the triangular polar coordinate transformation technique described by eatock taylor and chau 1992 finally the resulting discretized algebra equations can be expressed as 20 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 x 1 x 2 b 1 b 2 where 21 x 1 φ s 1 φ s 2 φ s n b 22 x 2 φ s n 1 φ s n 2 φ s n n f 23 a i j 11 α x i δ i j a i j 21 24 a i j 21 n 1 n b m 1 m g x m x i n h k ζ ς w m j m ζ ς 25 a i j 12 a i j 22 n 1 n f m 1 m g x m x i h k ζ ς w m j m ζ ς 26 b i 1 n 1 n b m 1 m g x

the numbers of nodes on the body and free surface boundaries respectively n b and n f are the numbers of elements on the body and free surface boundaries respectively m is the number of sampling points used in the standard gauss legendre method for the numerical calculation of the integration over each element w m is the integral weight at the mth sampling point j m ζ ς is the determinant of the jacobian matrix from the global coordinates to the local intrinsic coordinates after assembling the equations for each node on the whole integral surface a system of linear algebraic equations is established then the solution of the above boundary value problem can be obtained at a certain time step in this study the generalized minimal residual gmres iterative scheme saad and schultz 1986 with a diagonal preconditioner is applied to the solution of the system of equations which is proved more efficient compared with other algebraic equation solvers from the solution of the above boundary value problem and the corresponding boundary conditions the potential φ s and its normal derivative φ s n on boundaries of the whole fluid domain are all known the particle velocity components φ s both on the free surface and body surface can be simply obtained by the following formula 28 φ s x φ s y φ s z x ζ y ζ z ζ x ς y ς z ς n x n y n z 1 φ s ζ φ s ς φ s n where n x n y n z are the components of the unit normal vector n defined as 29 n n x n y n z 1 j x ζ x ς in which j denotes the magnitude of the normal vector and denotes a cross product the derivatives of x x y z and φ s with regard to ζ and ς in eqs 28 and 29 can be directly obtained through differentiation of the shape function within the surface element based on eq 19 it is noted that there are usually more than one element connected to a node thus the final velocity components at each node are obtained by averaging the values from eq 28 evaluated within every element surrounding this node 2 3 hydrodynamic forces and body motions once the velocity potential and its spatial derivatives have been solved at each time step the pressure on the body surface can be obtained by using the bernoulli s equation 30 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z thus the hydrodynamic forces f f 1 f 2 f 3 and moments m f 4 f 5 f 6 can subsequently be obtained by integrating the pressure over the wetted body surface the integrals over the exact wetted body surface s b are split into two parts one is over the wetted body surface s b w defined as the intersection of its boundary with the incident wave profile the other is transformed into the waterline integrals by taylor expansion at the incident wave elevation z η i x y t i e 31 f i s b p n i d s ρ s b w φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z n i d s ρ γ η s φ t 1 2 φ 2 1 2 g 2 η i η s η s 2 n i d l where ρ is the fluid density n i are the six components of the generalized unit normal vector n 1 n 2 n 3 n and n 4 n 5 n 6 r b n it should be noted that the velocity components φ on the body surface in eq 31 can be obtained numerically as mentioned above however it is rather difficult to calculate the time derivative of velocity potential φ t accurately especially in the case of freely moving bodies this is very crucial to obtain the correct pressure and hydrodynamic forces on the body surface to deal with it there are several ways to obtain φ t in the literature so far in the present study both a new kind of backward difference method with the consideration of grid motion and the indirect method wu and eatock taylor 1996 2003 are applied and these two independent results are cross checked for verification in the new kind of backward difference method by utilizing the time derivative operator δ δ t t v mesh the time derivative of velocity potential φ t can be written as 32 φ t φ i t φ s t φ i t δ φ s δ t v mesh φ s where v mesh is the mesh velocity on the body surface and δ φ s δ t can be obtained by a backward difference scheme utilizing the velocity potential of the present and previous time steps as for the indirect method the details of the derivation can be referred to wu and eatock taylor 1996 2003 and thus are not elaborated here in this way the hydrodynamic forces on the body can be indirectly obtained by using some auxiliary functions without the knowledge of the body surface pressure for floating bodies the equation of motion for a rigid body can be written as 33 j 1 6 m i j ξ j b i j ξ j k i j ξ j f i m g δ i 3 where m i j k i j and b i j are coefficients of the mass matrix the stiffness matrix and the damping matrix respectively as we known the overall damping level contains the structural damping and hydrodynamic damping which is very difficult to be accurately determined thus for simplification a linearized damping matrix is introduced in the calculation which contains the structural damping and the viscous damping neglected in the potential theory in this study the damping matrix is constructed by rayleigh damping based on the following formula b i i α i m i i where α i 2 ζ i ω n i is the damping coefficient ζ i and ω n i are the damping ratio and natural frequency of the body in the ith mode of motion other terms in the damping matrix are set to zero 3 numerical implementation 3 1 initial mesh generation in the present method we discretize the boundary integral equations by using quadratic boundary elements in this section we consider how the element mesh is established first we note that in general the whole boundary is not a smooth and continuous surface there are many corners and edges e g at the intersection of the free surface and the body surface in order to deal with this the discretized surface is divided into some simple continuous patches and initial mesh generation is performed on each of them as the hobem is used the node can be located at the corners or edges of the boundary surfaces and this will result in a singularity where the normal vectors at these points are undefined to deal with this a double or triple node is employed at the edges or corners so that we can place two or three different nodes at one spatial position to represent the different normal vectors for simple and regular boundaries structured quadrilateral meshes are adopted to discretize them and unstructured triangular meshes may be particularly suited to discretizing complex boundaries on the free surface as previously presented we can generate a finer mesh close to the body and a coarser mesh far from it fig 2 gives the illustration of an initial computational mesh generated by the above method for wave interaction with a monopile 3 2 time stepping scheme after solving the above boundary value problem and obtaining the fluid velocities on the free surface the free surface geometry and velocity potential are updated for the computation at the next time step by the time integral of the nonlinear free surface boundary conditions here the standard 4th order runge kutta rk4 time integration scheme with the ale approach is adopted providing good stability and accuracy at the beginning of the numerical simulation an abrupt initial condition should be avoided thus a ramp function is imposed to modulate the incident wave field so that the incident wave can smoothly develop from the calm water surface to the specified wave field it allows the numerical simulation to be more stable and to reach a steady state earlier a cosine ramp function r m is adopted in this paper as 34 r m 1 2 1 cos π t t m t t m 1 t t m where t m is the transition period here chosen as 2t with t the characteristic wave period 3 3 mesh deformation and interpolation the geometry of the computational domain varies with the elevation of the incident free surface and the exact position of the body as a result it is necessary to adjust the mesh at each time step in the light of these deformations in order to avoid remeshing the entire domain at each time step mesh deformation algorithms have been integrated with the ale approach so that it is possible to achieve a good quality of the mesh and keep the same mesh topology during the deformation in this study two mesh deformation algorithms are implemented a spring analogy method blom 2000 is used to update the mesh on the wetted body surface this method is common and can be adapted to an arbitrary geometry in the 3d domain however it requires the solution of a large scale system of linear equations whose size is approximately as large as the total number of grid nodes and hence can be very time consuming when the number of computational grids is quite large thus as an alternative an interpolation scheme based on radial basis functions rbfs presented by de boer et al 2007 is adopted here for the mesh deformation on the free surface for simplicity the free surface nodes are firstly projected onto the horizontal plane and then moved using the rbf interpolation method in this plane which results in the horizontal coordinates i e x and y of new nodes the interpolation function s x which describes the horizontal displacement of all free surface nodes can be expressed by a sum of basis functions 35 s x j 1 n b α j ψ x x b j p x where n b is the number of nodes on the boundary ψ is a given rbf with respect to the euclidean distance x x b j x b j y b j are the horizontal coordinates of boundary nodes for which the displacements are known and p is a linear polynomial the coefficients α j and the polynomial p are determined by the interpolation conditions and the additional requirements 36 s x b j d b j 37 j 1 n b α j q x b j 0 where d b contains the known discrete values of the displacement at the boundary nodes and q is a polynomial with a degree less than or equal to that of polynomial p these conditions can be expressed in the following system of linear algebra equations 38 m p p t 0 α β d b 0 where m is an n b n b matrix defined from the radial basis function m i j ψ x b i x b j p is an n b 3 matrix with row j given by 1 x b j y b j α is the vector consisting of the coefficients α j j 1 n b and β contains the coefficients of the linear polynomial p i e β j j 1 3 after solving the system of linear algebra equations and obtaining the interpolation coefficients the displacement of internal nodes on the free surface d in can then be derived by interpolation based on eq 35 as 39 d in s x i n the prominent advantages of this rbf interpolation method may be listed as follows firstly the method is quite efficient since it leads to a considerable reduction of computational efforts it is noted that the size of the linear system to be solved in eq 38 is equal to n b 3 n b 3 which is much smaller than that in mesh connectivity schemes such as the spring analogy method blom 2000 and laplacian smoothing technique bai and eatock taylor 2006 the size of the linear system encountered there is approximately as large as n in n in with n in the total number of grid nodes the total number of grid nodes is generally one or two order of magnitude higher than the number of boundary nodes in addition this rbf interpolation method is straightforward to implement since each node is moved individually by evaluating the displacement function according to its position in space which means no information about the mesh connectivity is required further it has been demonstrated that the method could maintain high mesh quality even for large mesh deformations in the literature e g de boer et al 2007 there are various rbfs available for the interpolation scheme nevertheless a proper rbf needs to be chosen since the robustness of the method is not the same for all rbfs in this study many rbfs have been tested and a thin plate spline ψ r r 2 ln r is chosen because it is found to be the best compromise between the resulting mesh quality robustness and computation time according to the resulting displacement s x the horizontal velocity components of the free surface nodes can be easily obtained by the finite difference scheme as for the vertical component of the node velocity an additional condition should be imposed to ensure that the node on the free surface remains on this interface i e 40 v mesh n φ i n on the basis of the horizontal coordinates of new nodes on the free surface obtained by the above mesh deformation algorithm the vertical position and velocity potential at the new node can be calculated by interpolation in the interpolation we must firstly find which old element the new node belongs to to find the corresponding old element the following criterion is adopted 41 l 1 n s sub l s ele where s sub is the area of a triangular sub element that is composed of the considered new node and two adjacent vertices of the old element s ele is the area of the old element and n is the number of triangular sub elements around the new node provided that eq 41 is satisfied the node must be within the corresponding element n then the local intrinsic coordinates ζ ς of the node can be determined based on the following simultaneous polynomial equations 42 x i k 1 k h k ζ ς x k n 0 y i k 1 k h k ζ ς y k n 0 the above system of nonlinear equations is solved iteratively by using the newton raphson method grilli et al 2001 finally the scattered wave elevation η s and velocity potential φ s at the new node can be obtained by utilizing the shape function within this old element 3 4 smoothing techniques it is well known that the so called saw tooth instability may occur on the free surface during the numerical simulation of strongly nonlinear waves which is also a common issue in the time domain analysis of nonlinear wave structure interaction many smoothing techniques have been developed to remove this numerical instability most of which are achieved through an interpolation scheme from adjacent nodes for structured grids fewer approaches have been developed so far for unstructured meshes in this study a chebyshev 5 point smoothing technique of longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 is used on the waterline nodes in addition a generalized 3 point low pass filter outlined by shao and faltinsen 2014b is applied elsewhere this low pass filter is a generalization of a 3 point interpolation scheme i e 43 f i 1 c f i c j 1 n i w i j f j where f i and f i are the values at the ith node before and after smoothing respectively they could be the scattered wave elevation η s or the velocity potential φ s here c is the strength of the filter f j j 1 n i is the value at the jth adjacent node and w ij is the weighting coefficient defined as 44 w i j l i j 2 j 1 n i l i j 2 where l ij is the distance between the selected ith node and the jth adjacent node n i is the number of adjacent nodes surrounding the ith node note that the proposed smoothing is only required when the local wave slope is very steep in the following calculations and it is typically applied at every 5 time steps to limit its influence on the accuracy of numerical solutions 3 5 numerical computation process in order to briefly summarize the contents of the above sections a flow chart is added here to clarify the numerical computation process as shown in fig 3 4 overview of the fourier and wavelet transforms when a steady state has been achieved during the simulation and the numerical results become periodic with time the amplitude of each harmonic component of wave forces or other time signals can be obtained by fourier analysis as the most classical signal processing analysis method the fourier transform ft is widely used in the processing of stationary signals with the use of the fast fourier transform fft technique frigo and johnson 1998 it becomes an extremely rapid method of transforming a time domain signal into its frequency content as 45 x f x t e i 2 π f t d t where x t denotes a signal in the time domain e g the time series of wave forces or motion responses and x f is its fourier transform that describes the frequency spectrum of the signal however the fourier transform ft has a notable limitation since it assumes that a signal is either infinite in duration or periodic over all time and thus the frequency content of the signal is stationary and does not change over time consequently any non stationarity will be simulated by the inclusion of pseudo harmonics that appear as a spread of energy without obvious physical meaning in addition the ft merely provides the frequency content of the signal but the information on the time localization of the frequency components is essentially lost in the process this limitation can be overcome to a certain extent by applying the wavelet transform wt the main characteristic of the wt is the dual localization property both in the time domain and in the frequency domain as well as its adaptive time frequency resolution which enables the wt to be more suitable for non stationary or transient signal analysis compared with the ft generally the wavelet transform wt of the signal x t is defined as the convolution of x t with a family of shifted and scaled versions of the mother wavelet ψ t 46 w t τ s 1 s x t ψ t τ s d t where the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate τ is the translation parameter corresponding to the position of the wavelet as it is shifted through the time domain signal and s is the scale dilation parameter determining the width of the wavelet the wavelet coefficient w t τ s which is in terms of the time scale functions represents the correlation between the wavelet and a localized section of the signal in this study the complex morlet wavelet is adopted as the mother wavelet which is one of the most extensively used mother wavelets the expression of the morlet wavelet is given as 47 ψ t 1 2 π e t 2 2 e i ω 0 t which represents a plane sinusoidal wave of frequency ω 0 modulated by a gaussian envelope of the unit width following the method of massel 2001 the relationship between the wavelet scale and the equivalent fourier period can be analytically derived for a particular wavelet function for the morlet wavelet the relation can be given as 48 s n ω 0 ω 0 2 2 4 π 1 f n α 1 f n setting ω 0 2 π yields that the constant α 1 0125 and thus the scale s n is approximately equal to the inverse of the frequency f n in this paper the fast fourier transform fft technique is adopted to obtain the amplitude of each harmonic component of wave forces in regular wave cases and the continuous wavelet transform cwt is adopted to obtain the wavelet spectrum in the time frequency domain for analyzing the ringing response of a monopile in focused waves 5 numerical results and discussion 5 1 convergence study in the convergence tests nonlinear wave diffraction around a bottom mounted vertical cylinder in regular waves is investigated here the case of kr 0 245 ka 0 19 and d r 10 0 is selected where k is the wavenumber r the radius of the cylinder d the water depth and a is half of the wave height which corresponds to the long wave regime and moderately steep wave events in finite water depth in the following calculations the stream function model of rienecker and fenton 1981 is utilized to simulate nonlinear regular incident waves the convergence study of computational grids is firstly implemented with three different meshes these meshes are labelled as mesh a b and c respectively and their basic parameters are shown in table 1 on the free surface the radius of the computational domain is chosen as r d 2 λ where λ is the linear characteristic wavelength an annulus damping zone over a distance of one wavelength is applied on the outer region of the computational domain the radial length of the free surface element gradually increases towards the outer boundary since only the solutions of φ s and η s need to be solved in this study and the scattered waves decay with the increase of the distance from the body this leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort fig 4 a and b show the time series of wave run up at the front of the cylinder and horizontal force on the cylinder using these three meshes respectively it appears that the numerical calculation can converge quickly and the results obtained with mesh b are almost identical with those obtained with mesh c the error analysis of the first three harmonic amplitudes of horizontal force is also presented in table 2 in the table f x b i f x c i f x c i denotes the relative error of the results obtained with mesh b and mesh c where the superscript i indicates the ith harmonic it can be seen that the relative error is all less than 2 0 for each harmonic component afterwards the convergence test is carried out with regard to different time steps using δ t t 50 t 80 and t 100 and the similar convergence can be found it appears that the results with mesh b and δ t t 80 are sufficiently accurate based on the convergence study fig 5 shows the comparison of the backward difference method and the indirect method in calculating wave forces it appears that there is almost no difference between these two independent results as a result the accuracy of both methods is verified through the comparison in addition the numerical results show that the steady state is reached shortly after the transition period and can last for a very long time which indicates that the damping layer is effective and no significant waves are reflected from the far truncated boundary therefore the proposed numerical model is applicable for a long time simulation of wave structure interaction problems 5 2 wave run up profile around a vertical cylinder in order to check the accuracy of the proposed numerical model the wave run up around a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder is firstly investigated by comparison with a series of experimental data obtained by kriebel 1992 fig 6 shows the wave run up profile around the vertical cylinder with kr 0 308 and kd 0 853 in this case two different wave heights are applied in terms of ka 0 091 and ka 0 125 where a denotes the incident wave amplitude defined as half of the wave height in the figure θ denotes the azimuthal angle around the cylinder and θ 0 and θ 180 are corresponding to the downwave side and upwave side respectively the wave run up profile consists of the maximum wave elevation at each location along the circumferential direction which is obtained from the steady state part of the results as shown in fig 6 the present numerical results are compared with the linear theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 the second order theory and the experimental data kriebel 1992 in general it can be seen that significant nonlinear diffraction effects are present in this test case and the linear theory poorly predicts the wave run up distributions around the circumference of the cylinder from the comparison it can be seen that the linear theory markedly underestimates the maximum wave run up at the front of the cylinder relative error of about 29 for ka 0 091 and 38 for ka 0 125 nevertheless the present results agree well with the experimental data and even generally capture the higher order effects that are not part of the second order theory on the upwave side of the cylinder it is noted that the present model provides a more reasonable estimation of the maximum wave run up than the second order theory on the downwave side the present model predicts a substantial localized recovery of the wave elevation in this area due to nonlinear diffraction although the predicted value of maximum wave run up at the rear of the cylinder seems larger compared with the experimental data in addition as shown in fig 7 similar conclusions are applicable to another case with kr 0 374 and kd 1 036 in the case two different wave heights corresponding to ka 0 1025 and ka 0 143 are adopted it is notable that higher order nonlinear effects superior than 2nd order play a certain role in the wave diffraction around the cylinder clear differences can be observed between the second order results and the experimental data as the wave steepness increases these higher order effects are correctly captured by the present model on the upwave side of the cylinder θ π 3 nevertheless on the downwave side some significant differences between the present results and the experimental data are observed this is perhaps due to the fact that the proposed numerical model based on the weak scatterer approximation may not include all nonlinearities of wave structure interactions since only the interactions between incident waves and scattered waves are taken into consideration while the interactions between scattered waves are neglected which can be crucial on the downwave side flow separation and viscous effects may also play a certain role in the results of wave run up at the rear of the cylinder 5 3 higher harmonic wave forces on a vertical cylinder in this section a bottom mounted vertical circular cylinder in nonlinear regular waves is investigated to further verify the proposed model with regard to the higher harmonic wave forces on offshore structures a relatively comprehensive investigation is provided with respect to a series of non dimensional wavenumbers or cylinder sizes kr from 0 166 to 0 378 the ratio between the water depth d and the cylinder radius r applied in the numerical calculations is set to d r 10 three different wave steepnesses are considered to investigate the effects of nonlinearity including ka 0 10 0 15 and 0 19 in this study the time series of the horizontal force on the vertical cylinder is firstly computed and then the fourier analysis over 10 wave periods is implemented when the steady state has been reached the amplitude of the nth harmonic horizontal force is normalized by ρ g a n r 3 n as did in huseby and grue 2000 the non dimensional amplitudes of the first second and third harmonic components of the horizontal force are shown in figs 8 10 respectively in general the present numerical results of the first and second harmonic wave forces are consistent with the solutions obtained from the linear and second order frequency domain potential flow solvers i e wafdut teng and eatock taylor 1995 and qtfdut teng et al 1999 for small ka conditions more specifically the non dimensional first harmonic force increases with the increase of the cylinder size kr up to a certain point and then decreases with further increasing the cylinder size as shown in fig 8 in addition it appears that for all cylinder sizes investigated here the present non dimensional results of the first harmonic force are nearly constant for these three different wave steepnesses even when ka becomes rather large by using the inertia term in the morison equation an estimation of the first harmonic force is also provided in fig 8 it can be seen that the morison inertia term with an inertia coefficient of two c m 2 0 predicts the first harmonic force quite well for a smaller cylinder size kr 0 5 while failing to provide a good estimation of wave force for a larger cylinder size nevertheless as shown in fig 9 the non dimensional second harmonic force decreases rapidly with the increase of the cylinder size and reaches a minimum at about kr 0 4 good agreement is achieved between the present numerical results and the second order frequency domain results for small and moderate ka conditions whereas clear differences are observed as the wave steepness further increases furthermore it appears that the present non dimensional results of the second harmonic force gradually decrease with the increase of wave steepness which is similar with the experimental observations of huseby and grue 2000 it is noted that the third and higher harmonic forces are extremely small compared with the total force when the wave steepness is small as a result for small ka conditions it is quite difficult to accurately extract the higher harmonic components from the time series through fourier analysis thus for the third harmonic wave force only the numerical results with ka 0 19 are presented in fig 10 furthermore the non dimensional theoretical solutions of faltinsen et al 1995 referred to as fnv and malenica and molin 1995 are shown in terms of a solid and a dashed line respectively and both of which are irrelevant to a r if kr is determined the fnv theory is analytically derived in infinite water depth and thus independent of the d r ratio the solution of malenica and molin 1995 is obtained based on a complete third order diffraction theory in finite water depth and the selected results provided in the original paper with d r 10 are included here for reference the cfd results paulsen et al 2012 with the same d r ratio as well as the experimental data huseby and grue 2000 for the deep water case with ka 0 19 are also shown in fig 10 for comparison it can be seen that a satisfactory agreement between the present numerical results and theoretical solutions is achieved for kr 0 25 for larger values of kr the present results of the third harmonic force are somewhat smaller than the solutions from the above theoretical models whereas they have a good agreement with the experimental data of huseby and grue 2000 the similar discrepancy between the experimental data and theoretical solutions can also be observed in kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 particularly for large ka conditions the discrepancy in the third harmonic force was demonstrated to be due to flow separation effects and clearly related to the keulegan carpenter kc number furthermore it appears that the discrepancy increases gradually with the increase of wave steepness to further verify the proposed model and explain the discrepancy with regard to the higher harmonic wave forces on a vertical cylinder in the condition of longer waves and finite water depth two sets of test cases corresponding to kr 0 127 and 0 105 are selected and simulated for a range of wave steepness ka the ratio between the water depth d and the cylinder radius r is set to d r 7 83 to be consistent with the experiments of kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 the first three harmonics of the horizontal wave force are presented versus the generalized fnv theory and published experimental data kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 as a function of wave steepness ka the amplitude of each harmonic of the horizontal force is normalized by ρ g r 3 as did in kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 fig 11 shows the amplitudes of the first three harmonics with kr 0 127 and d r 7 83 it can be seen that for each harmonic component the present numerical results all have a quite reasonable agreement with the fnv theory and experimental data for small to medium wave steepness up to approximately ka 0 12 nevertheless there is a gradual increase in discrepancy with increasing wave steepness particularly in the third harmonic of the horizontal force similar phenomena and discrepancies can also be observed in fig 12 for longer waves with kr 0 105 and d r 7 83 furthermore it is noted that there are numerical stability issues with steeper wave conditions although some smoothing techniques have been utilized in the numerical model and thus the accuracy of the numerical results cannot be guaranteed in these conditions one must acknowledge that viscous flow separation effects might be dominant once the wave conditions reach certain kc numbers which is corresponding to kc 3 5 4 0 and above in these two cases and then the present numerical model begins to break down inevitably the snapshots of the free surface for a couple of these cases are also presented figs 13 and 14 show the contour maps of the free surface elevation in the vicinity of the cylinder with kr 0 127 ka 0 15 and kr 0 105 ka 0 126 respectively 5 4 ringing response of a monopile in focused waves a build up of resonant motion is illustrated with the model of a rigid monopile mounted to a hinge joint on a base plate at the tank floor which is similar with the layout in the experiments of chaplin et al 1997 and riise et al 2018 as shown in fig 15 the rigid monopile is hinged at the bottom and supported at the top with springs in the horizontal plane which can only rotate in the pitch mode of motion with an angle θ t as a simplification it can be represented as an idealized single degree of freedom elastic system main structural and mechanical parameters of the monopile are outlined in table 3 on the basis of the linear equation of undamped free motion in the frequency domain the natural frequency of the monopile in the pitch mode of motion can be estimated as 49 ω n 5 k 55 c 55 m 55 a 55 ω n 5 where m 55 a 55 k 55 and c 55 are coefficients of the mass the added mass the stiffness and the hydrostatic restoring matrix in the pitch mode of motion respectively the added mass a 55 is a function of frequency thus the natural frequency of the monopile is obtained through iterations in the present study a two dimensional focused wave model is adopted to simulate large transient wave events the use of focused wave groups overcomes some shortcomings of regular incident waves i e the lack of a proper representation of the random and broadband properties of ocean waves in realistic sea states in this model using the technique of multi frequency focusing a specified range of wave components are generated and their relative phases are adjusted so that at one instant in time all the discrete wave components may be focused at a specific spatial position in this way a large wave crest elevation is produced due to constructive interference the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 ning et al 2009 is adopted to obtain the expressions of the incident surface elevation and velocity potential i e η i and φ i for focused wave groups they are expressed in the following forms 50 η i η i 1 η i 2 51 φ i φ i 1 φ i 2 where η i 1 and φ i 1 are the linear wave elevation and velocity potential of incident waves and η i 2 and φ i 2 are the corresponding second order wave elevation and velocity potential respectively within the framework of linear theory the water surface elevation of a focused wave group can be written as 52 η i 1 x t i 1 n a i cos k i x x f ω i t t f where n is the total number of discrete wave components and a i k i and ω i denote the amplitude the wavenumber and the angular frequency of the ith wave component respectively x f and t f are the specified focal position and focusing time respectively and both of them are assumed to be equal to zero i e x f 0 and t f 0 in this paper in addition considering the nonlinear wave wave interactions the second order wave elevation is expressed as 53 η i 2 x t i 1 n j i n a i a j h ω i ω j cos k i k j x x f ω i ω j t t f 1 2 i 1 n a i 2 h ω i ω i cos 2 k i x x f ω i t t f where h ω i ω j denote the second order wave wave interaction coefficients corresponding to the sum and difference frequency terms the specific expression of h ω i ω j can be referred to dalzell 1999 and ning et al 2009 and thus is not elaborated here the corresponding linear and second order velocity potentials can also be obtained in a similar manner to obtain realistic modeling of an extreme wave event the amplitude spectrum of discrete wave components can be determined by the newwave model tromans et al 1991 as 54 a i a s ω i δ ω i i 1 n s ω i δ ω i in which a is the linear sum of the component wave amplitudes s ω i is the underlying frequency spectrum and δ ω i is the frequency spacing the discrete frequency component ω i is uniformly spaced over the frequency band ω 1 ω n and the frequency bandwidth is defined as 55 δ ω ω n ω 1 in this section ringing response of a bottom hinged monopile in focused wave groups is investigated the underlying wave components are obtained based on the jonswap spectrum goda 1999 with the peak enhancement factor of γ 3 3 where the wave energy is mainly concentrated near the spectral peak frequency in order to highlight the third harmonic resonance of the monopile in pitch motion the peak frequency of the incident focused wave groups is set to near one third of the natural frequency i e ω p ω n 5 3 0 1 49 rad s thus the non dimensional cylinder size k p r is equal to about 0 25 where k p is the wavenumber corresponding to the peak frequency ω p and three different input wave amplitudes are considered to investigate the effects of nonlinearity including a r 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 note that the value of k p r is relatively small typically 0 10 0 30 and the input wave amplitude is comparable to the radius of the monopile i e a r 1 0 this corresponds to the field conditions where the ringing response is expected to occur the vertical axis of the monopile is located at the focal position of the incident wave groups and the monopile is hinged at a lateral axis at the level of 5 m below the still water level i e z 5 0 m with a water depth of d 6 0 m the normalized power spectrum of incoming waves with ω p 1 49 rad s and γ 3 3 used in the numerical simulation is shown in fig 16 considering that the jonswap spectrum is narrow banded and most of the wave energy is concentrated near the peak frequency the frequency band ranging from 0 8 to 2 4 rad s is adopted numerical convergence test is firstly carried out on the number of wave components as an example fig 17 a shows the time series of the incident wave elevation at the focal position for different numbers of wave components n 20 40 and 60 with a r 1 0 and the comparison of corresponding amplitude spectra is presented in fig 17 b from the figures it appears that the numerical results are nearly identical for the latter two cases indicating that the convergence of the incident wave groups is achieved using n 40 as a result the incoming wave parameters outlined in table 4 are used in the following numerical calculations afterwards convergence tests of mesh size and time step have also been carried out in addition the peak wavelength λ p and the peak period t p are selected as the measurement of mesh size and time step respectively in the following calculations the appropriate computational grids have been chosen as outlined in section 5 1 and the numerical results have been proved to be convergent based on the convergence tests using computational grids with different resolutions in addition several time steps have been tested and δ t t p 100 is found to be sufficiently accurate for each of the cases discussed below in this study the time series of the pitch moment and response of the monopile are firstly provided and then the wavelet analysis is implemented for analyzing the time frequency characteristic of the ringing response furthermore the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response of the monopile are discussed respectively 5 4 1 effects of peak frequency in this section the effects of the peak frequency of incoming waves on the ringing response of the monopile are firstly investigated a range of peak frequencies ω p from 1 37 to 1 61 rad s with an increment of 0 06 rad s are chosen numerical calculations are implemented with the same input wave amplitude a r 1 0 the time series of the non dimensional pitch response of the monopile with ω p 1 37 1 49 and 1 61 rad s are shown in fig 18 a c respectively the corresponding amplitude spectra of pitch response for these three peak frequencies are shown in fig 19 which are obtained by fourier analysis over 20 peak periods 10t p before the focusing time and 10t p after the focusing time with a hanning window it can be seen from fig 17 b that the second harmonic component of incoming waves with ω p 1 49 rad s is much less than the first one and the third or higher harmonic components can nearly be neglected however as shown in fig 18 b the third harmonic pitch motion is still quite obvious the similar trend is also applicable to the conditions of other peak frequencies three oscillations within each characteristic period t p can be clearly observed after the focusing time t f 0 which is close related to the nonlinear wave structure interaction and the relationship between the peak frequency of incoming waves and the natural frequency of the monopile in pitch motion further when the peak frequency ω p is away from 1 49 rad s i e one third of the natural frequency the amplitude of the third harmonic pitch response appears to be reduced as shown in fig 19 all these indicate that the third harmonic resonance response will occur provided that the peak frequency of incoming waves is close to one third of the natural frequency similarly the fourth fifth and even higher harmonic resonance response may also be induced when the wave steepness is quite large or even breaking as a result the phenomenon of ringing should be noted in the practical design and it is necessary to avoid the high order wave frequency being right around the natural frequency of the monopile as far as possible 5 4 2 effects of input wave amplitude in this section the effects of input wave amplitude on the ringing response are investigated the peak frequency of incoming waves is maintained as ω p ω n 5 3 0 1 49 rad s figs 20 and 21 show the pitch moment and response of the monopile with different input wave amplitudes i e a r 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 respectively according to the linear theory the numerical results should be irrelevant to the input wave amplitude when they are normalized by a therefore any distinction between the normalized numerical results with different values of a r is due to nonlinear effects it can be seen from fig 21 that the effects of nonlinearity become significant and the higher harmonic components gradually dominate the pitch response as the input wave amplitude increases three oscillations within each characteristic period t p can be clearly observed in the pitch response when a r 0 8 and 1 0 which bursts shortly after the focusing time and lasts for several peak periods this suggests that the ringing response occurs immediately after the maximum crest of focused wave groups passing through the location of the monopile further the corresponding wavelet spectra of pitch response with a r 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 are shown in fig 22 the color bar in the figure indicates the magnitude of the normalized pitch response for a given time and frequency i e the modulus of the wavelet coefficient w t τ s in this way the effect of input wave amplitude on the pitch response can be seen more clearly through analyzing the time frequency characteristic of the response as expected the frequency components of pitch response contain the first harmonic component within the input frequency range 0 8 f f p 1 6 and the higher harmonic components f f p 1 6 due to nonlinear wave wave and wave structure interactions it can be seen clearly that when a r 0 6 the pitch response is dominated by the first harmonic component and the higher harmonic components are fairly small nevertheless when a r 0 8 and 1 0 the third harmonic component approximately f f p 3 appears to be quite significant after the focusing time and lasts for several peak periods as shown in fig 22 b and c it can be seen that the magnitude of the third harmonic component is almost as large as the first harmonic component in the condition of a r 1 0 actually since the peak frequency of incoming waves is set to around one third of the natural frequency the third harmonic component will lead to the resonant response of the monopile in pitch motion provided that the input wave amplitude is sufficiently large and damping ratio is slight 5 4 3 effects of damping ratio it has been presented by davies et al 1994 that the ringing response is insensitive to the damping level to investigate that three different damping ratios ζ 1 2 5 are applied in this section the small damping ratio implies a lightly damped vibration system that is associated with monopile support structures for offshore wind turbines as suggested by kallehave et al 2015 the pitch moment and response for different damping ratios with ω p 1 49 rad s and a r 1 0 are shown in figs 23 and 24 respectively it appears that the magnitude of damping ratio has slight influence on the peak value of pitch responses however the larger damping ratio leads to a faster decay of the resonant response after the peak further fig 25 a and b as well as fig 22 c show the corresponding wavelet spectra of pitch response for these three damping ratios ζ 1 2 5 it can be seen clearly that the variation of the first and second harmonic components is almost negligible with varying damping ratios however when a larger damping ratio is adopted the amplitude of the third harmonic component significantly reduces and it decays more rapidly after the peak value this indicates that the damping ratio has prominent effects on the third harmonic resonance of the monopile in pitch motion studied in this paper furthermore it is noted that the higher harmonic components play an important role in the response particularly in the condition of large input wave amplitude and small damping ratio as shown in fig 25 a consequently the ringing response induced by the higher harmonic wave loads should be noted in the practical design and operation of a monopile for offshore wind turbines 6 conclusions in this paper a time domain nonlinear potential flow model is developed based on the weak scatterer approximation the higher order boundary element method hobem is employed to solve the corresponding boundary value problem at each time step in the time marching process the 4th order runge kutta time integration scheme with an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted on the free surface the proposed model is verified by a series of nonlinear wave diffraction problems in regular waves it appears that in terms of the wave run up and higher harmonic wave forces the present results are all in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical solutions and experimental results furthermore it appears to be notable that higher order effects play a certain role in the simulation of such phenomenon the ringing response of a monopile exposed to moderately steep focused waves is subsequently investigated for several different wave conditions the effects of peak frequency input wave amplitude and damping ratio on the ringing response are discussed further the wavelet analysis is implemented for analyzing the time frequency characteristic of the ringing response it is noted that the third harmonic resonance response will occur if the peak frequency of incoming waves is close to one third of the natural frequency and the higher harmonic components are essential for accurate prediction of the response particularly in the condition of large input wave amplitude and small damping ratio consequently the ringing response induced by the higher harmonic wave loads should be noted in the practical design and operation of a monopile for offshore wind turbines the present numerical model has shown its ability to deal with the interaction between moderately steep waves and offshore structures no matter in the aspect of accuracy or robustness provided that the weak scatterer hypothesis may be well satisfied present study can also be extended to the nonlinear seakeeping analysis of ships and hydrodynamic performance evaluation of point absorber wave energy converters in order to consider more complex sea states e g nonlinear irregular waves with possible directional spreading it may be worthwhile to combine the present numerical model with a high order
